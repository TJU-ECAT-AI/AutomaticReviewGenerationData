          [1] "Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity"

[2] "The support materials, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and zeolite, can also affect catalytic performance on account of the significant differences in textural properties."

[3] "Especially, the Mg(Al)O oxides obtained by calcining hydrotalcite compounds (HT) have been studied extensively during the past years, owing to their suitable acidbase properties, high thermal stability, large surface area and memory effect"

[4] "Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)"

[5] "The In0 has been proved to promote the transfer of coke from the active site to the support and the stabilization of the active metal species"

[6] "The formation of meixnerite can adjust the acidbase properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance"

[7] "The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the catalyst reduced with H2/N2 can reach 51% and 97%, respectively, and even stabilize at 45% and 92% after running for 30 h. This is mainly attributable to its high Pt dispersion and In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction and small metal particle size, which also result in a low content of coke deposits on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst."

[8] "The smaller metal particles are more active for propane dehydrogenation performance and beneficial to resist the coke deposition"

[9] "As a kind of HT with an interlayer -OH anion, the high crystallinity meixnerite may be helpful to keep the high dispersion and uniform distribution of surface metal active sites during reaction."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using promoters: Adding elements like In, Sn, Ga or Zn to Pt-based catalysts to improve propylene selectivity.

2. Optimizing support materials: Utilizing supports like Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, zeolites, and especially Mg(Al)O oxides obtained from hydrotalcite compounds (HT) due to their suitable acid-base properties, high thermal stability, large surface area, and memory effect.

3. Stabilizing HT-based catalysts: Combining with graphene networks, growing on metal or alloy substrates, and loading on oxide materials like γ-Al2O3, ZnO, and SnO2.

4. Promoting coke transfer: Increasing In0 content to facilitate the transfer of coke from active sites to the support, stabilizing active metal species.

5. Forming meixnerite: Encouraging the formation of high-crystallinity meixnerite to maintain high dispersion and uniform distribution of surface metal active sites during reaction, and to adjust acid-base properties and improve coke resistance.

6. Controlling reduction atmosphere: Using H2/N2 reduction to achieve high Pt dispersion, increased In0/In3+ ratio, strong PtIn interaction, and small metal particle size, resulting in improved stability and low coke deposition.

7. Optimizing metal particle size: Smaller metal particles are more active for propane dehydrogenation and better resist coke deposition.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on improving selectivity, stability, and coke resistance. They aim to maintain high catalytic activity over extended periods, which is crucial for industrial applications. The strategies involve careful selection and modification of both the active metal components and support materials to create synergistic effects that enhance overall catalyst performance and longevity.
