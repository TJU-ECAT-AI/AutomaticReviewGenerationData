Recent strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using promoters: Adding elements like In, Sn, Ga or Zn to Pt-based catalysts to improve propylene selectivity.

2. Optimizing support materials: Utilizing supports like Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, zeolites, and especially Mg(Al)O oxides derived from hydrotalcite compounds (HT) due to their suitable acid-base properties, high thermal stability, large surface area, and memory effect.

3. Stabilizing HT-based catalysts: Combining them with graphene networks, growing them on metal or alloy substrates, or loading them on oxide materials like γ-Al2O3, ZnO, and SnO2.

4. Promoting coke transfer: Increasing the amount of metallic indium (In0) to facilitate the transfer of coke from active sites to the support, thereby stabilizing active metal species.

5. Forming meixnerite: This can adjust the acid-base properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance.

6. Controlling reduction atmosphere: The study shows that reduction atmosphere significantly influences the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of catalysts like PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving selectivity, stability, and coke resistance. They also focus on optimizing support materials and metal-support interactions to enhance overall catalytic performance for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略和方法包括：

1. 使用助剂：向铂基催化剂中添加In、Sn、Ga或Zn等元素，以提高丙烯选择性。

2. 优化载体材料：利用Al2O3、SiO2、ZrO2、沸石等载体，特别是源自水滑石化合物（HT）的Mg(Al)O氧化物，因为它们具有适当的酸碱性质、高热稳定性、大比表面积和记忆效应。

3. 稳定HT基催化剂：将它们与石墨烯网络结合，在金属或合金基底上生长，或者负载在γ-Al2O3、ZnO和SnO2等氧化物材料上。

4. 促进焦炭转移：增加金属铟（In0）的含量，以促进焦炭从活性位点转移到载体上，从而稳定活性金属物种。

5. 形成水滑石：这可以调节催化剂的酸碱性质并提高其抗焦性能。

6. 控制还原气氛：研究表明，还原气氛显著影响PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO等催化剂的物理化学性质和催化性能。

这些进展通过提高选择性、稳定性和抗焦性能来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战。它们还着重于优化载体材料和金属-载体相互作用，以提高工业应用中的整体催化性能。
