[1] "The stability of support plays an important role in reactions. Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)"

[2] "The smaller metal particles are more active for propane dehydrogenation performance and beneficial to resist the coke deposition"

[3] "The formation of meixnerite can adjust the acidbase properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance"

[4] "As compared with the diffraction strength of meixnerite, the only direct evidence is that the diffraction strength of graphite and the amount of deposited coke (see TG analysis below) show an opposite trend in accordance with the order from H2/N2- to C3H8/H2/N2- and C3H8-reduced catalysts."

[5] "The lowest coke formation on H2/N2-reduced catalyst should be related to the small metal particle size, strong PtIn interaction and suitable acidbase properties caused by the formation of meixnerite."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Stabilizing the support: Combining hydrotalcite-based catalysts with graphene networks, growing them on metal/alloy substrates, or loading them on oxide materials.

2. Optimizing metal particle size: Smaller metal particles are more active and resist coke deposition better.

3. Adjusting acid-base properties: Formation of meixnerite can improve coke resistance by modifying the catalyst's acid-base characteristics.

4. Controlling reduction atmosphere: H2/N2 reduction leads to smaller metal particles, stronger metal-support interactions, and formation of meixnerite, all contributing to improved stability and coke resistance.

5. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between the active metal (e.g., Pt) and promoters (e.g., In) or the support material can improve stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by focusing on support stability, metal dispersion, coke resistance, and tuning of surface properties.

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity"

[2] "ZnO was employed as the support for PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalytic system on account of its good stability."

[3] "The In0 has been proved to promote the transfer of coke from the active site to the support and the stabilization of the active metal species"

[4] "The formation of meixnerite can adjust the acidbase properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance"
