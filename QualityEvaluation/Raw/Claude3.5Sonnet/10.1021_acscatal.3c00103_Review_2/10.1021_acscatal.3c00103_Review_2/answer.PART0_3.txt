Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Introducing promoters: This involves adding metal or metal oxide promoters to regulate active compounds in both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. For Pt-based catalysts, metal promoters are added to form alloys or intermetallic compounds, which helps ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation.

2. Forming oxide compounds: For metal oxide-based catalysts, introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound improves the dispersion of active species and enhances catalytic stability.

3. Regulating metal oxides with noble metals: This approach improves dehydrogenation performance by modifying the properties of metal oxide catalysts with small amounts of noble metals.

4. Subsurface regulation: This method involves tuning the adsorptive properties of metal alloys by modifying their subsurface composition, which enhances catalytic performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:
- Improving catalytic stability and longevity
- Enhancing selectivity towards desired products
- Reducing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
- Optimizing the dispersion and electronic properties of active sites
- Enabling more efficient use of precious metals like platinum

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
