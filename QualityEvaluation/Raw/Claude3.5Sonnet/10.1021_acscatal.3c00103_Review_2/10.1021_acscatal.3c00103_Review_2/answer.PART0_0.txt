Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Introducing promoters: For both Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts, adding appropriate promoters helps regulate active compounds and improve stability.

2. Forming alloys or intermetallic compounds: In Pt-based systems, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is highly effective in improving central active components and inhibiting deactivation.

3. Creating oxide compounds: For metal oxide-based catalysts, introducing another metal oxide to form compounds improves active species dispersion and enhances stability by modifying coordination and electronic states.

4. Regulating with noble metals: Especially for metal oxide-based catalysts, adding trace amounts of noble metals like Pt can significantly improve dehydrogenation performance and stability.

5. Subsurface regulation: Tuning the subsurface composition of metal alloys has shown promise in enhancing catalytic performance by altering adsorptive properties.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by optimizing active site dispersion, inhibiting coke formation and sintering, and tuning electronic properties. They aim to improve long-term stability, selectivity, and activity for industrial applications while potentially reducing the required amount of precious metals like Pt.
