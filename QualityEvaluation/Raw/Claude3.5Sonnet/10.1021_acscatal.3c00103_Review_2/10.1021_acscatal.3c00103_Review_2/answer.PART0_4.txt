Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Introducing promoters: Adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds in Pt-based catalysts, and introducing other metal oxides to form oxide compounds in metal oxide-based catalysts. This helps regulate active compounds, improve dispersion of active species, and inhibit catalytic deactivation.

2. Noble metal regulation: Modifying metal oxide catalysts with trace amounts of noble metals like Pt to improve dehydrogenation performance and stability.

3. Subsurface regulation: Tuning the subsurface composition of metal alloy catalysts to optimize adsorptive properties and enhance catalytic performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Improving stability and longevity of catalysts
2. Enhancing selectivity towards desired products
3. Reducing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
4. Optimizing electronic and geometric properties of active sites
5. Increasing dispersion of active species

These strategies aim to develop more efficient, selective, and durable catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
