Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Zeolite encapsulation: Using zeolites with well-defined microporous structures and excellent thermal stability as supports to stabilize metal species. This approach results in zeolite-encaged metal catalysts with remarkable catalytic stability.

2. Bimetallic clusters: Developing catalysts with highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, such as Ga-Pt, encapsulated within zeolites. This strategy combines the benefits of bimetallic systems with the stabilizing effects of zeolite encapsulation.

3. In-situ synthesis methods: Employing in-situ preparation techniques, such as hydrothermal processes followed by ligand-protected direct H2 reduction, to create well-dispersed and stable metal clusters within zeolite structures.

4. Utilization of specific zeolite types: Using purely siliceous zeolites like silicalite-1 (S-1, MFI zeotype) as supports for metal catalysts to enhance stability and performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by improving thermal stability, preventing metal sintering, and enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. The resulting catalysts, such as GaPt@S-1, demonstrate excellent catalytic performance and high stability during propane dehydrogenation (PDH), making them promising for industrial applications.
