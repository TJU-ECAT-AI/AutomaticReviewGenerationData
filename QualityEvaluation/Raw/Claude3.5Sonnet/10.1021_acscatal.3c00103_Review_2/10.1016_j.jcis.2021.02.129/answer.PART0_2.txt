[1] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species. In particular, zeolite-encaged metal catalysts possess unique and remarkable catalytic stability, which is very attractive in heterogeneous catalysis"

[2] "Recently, Pt and PtM catalysts (M = Zn, Sn) have been encapsulated into zeolites, and the reports have shown that the zeolite-encapsulated supported catalysts with excellent stability are valuable in practical applications"

[3] "Herein, highly dispersed Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters encapsulated within a purely siliceous silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were prepared by an in situ method of hydrothermal process and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction."

[4] "Notably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using zeolites as supports: Zeolites with well-defined microporous structures and excellent thermal stability are being used to stabilize metal species.

2. Encapsulating metal catalysts in zeolites: This approach creates zeolite-encaged metal catalysts with remarkable catalytic stability.

3. Developing bimetallic catalysts: Combining metals like Ga and Pt to form bimetallic clusters can improve performance and stability.

4. In-situ synthesis methods: Techniques such as hydrothermal processes followed by ligand-protected direct H2 reduction are being used to prepare highly dispersed bimetallic clusters within zeolites.

5. Focusing on specific zeolite types: Silicalite-1 (S-1, MFI zeotype) has been used successfully to encapsulate Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design and fabrication by improving thermal stability, preventing metal sintering, and enhancing overall catalytic performance. The resulting catalysts, such as GaPt@S-1, demonstrate excellent catalytic performance and high stability during propane dehydrogenation (PDH), making them promising for industrial applications.
