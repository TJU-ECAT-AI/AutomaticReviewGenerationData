Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using zeolites as supports: Zeolites with well-defined microporous structures and excellent thermal stability are being used to stabilize metal species.

2. Encapsulation of metal catalysts: Zeolite-encaged metal catalysts show remarkable catalytic stability, which is beneficial for heterogeneous catalysis.

3. Bimetallic clusters: Highly dispersed bimetallic clusters, such as Ga-Pt, are being encapsulated within zeolites to improve stability and performance.

4. In-situ preparation methods: Techniques like hydrothermal processes followed by ligand-protected direct H2 reduction are being used to prepare these catalysts.

5. Use of specific zeolite types: Silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) is being used as a support for encapsulating bimetallic clusters.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by improving thermal stability, preventing metal sintering, and enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. The resulting catalysts, such as GaPt@S-1, show excellent catalytic performance and high stability during propane dehydrogenation (PDH), making them promising for industrial applications.
