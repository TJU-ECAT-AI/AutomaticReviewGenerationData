[1] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst, Ba has been introduced. The coverage of surface tetrahedrally coordinated Ga by Ba leads to the decreased coke formation and increased ethylene selectivity."

[2] "Even so, the performance of supported monometallic Pt catalysts are still not satisfactory. The catalyst is not selective and deactivates quickly due to coke deposition, because the strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions."

[3] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[4] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."

[5] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Introduction of promoters: Adding elements like Ba to cover active sites and reduce coke formation while maintaining selectivity.

2. Alloying with secondary metals: Forming alloys with Pt helps anchor the particles to the support, reducing sintering and migration.

3. Overcoating: Applying an Al2O3 overcoat via atomic layer deposition to prevent Pt nanoparticle sintering.

4. Optimizing regeneration: Using halides (e.g. chlorine) during air regeneration to redisperse sintered Pt particles, rather than simple coke burn-off.

5. Carrier modification: Using carriers with strong metal-support interactions to inhibit sintering.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:
- Improving coking resistance
- Enhancing sintering resistance 
- Optimizing regeneration procedures
- Maintaining high selectivity and activity

They aim to prolong catalyst lifetime, reduce deactivation rates, and improve overall process economics for industrial applications. However, further work is still needed to develop more stable, selective and cost-effective catalysts for commercial use.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 引入助剂：添加如Ba等元素覆盖活性位点，减少积碳形成，同时保持选择性。

2. 与次要金属合金化：与Pt形成合金有助于将粒子锚定在载体上，减少烧结和迁移。

3. 过覆盖：通过原子层沉积应用Al2O3过覆盖层，防止Pt纳米粒子烧结。

4. 优化再生：在空气再生过程中使用卤化物（如氯）重新分散烧结的Pt粒子，而不是简单的积碳燃烧。

5. 载体改性：使用与金属有强相互作用的载体来抑制烧结。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：
- 提高抗积碳能力
- 增强抗烧结能力
- 优化再生程序
- 保持高选择性和活性

它们旨在延长催化剂寿命，降低失活速率，并改善工业应用的整体经济性。然而，仍需进一步工作来开发更稳定、选择性更高和更具成本效益的催化剂用于商业用途。
