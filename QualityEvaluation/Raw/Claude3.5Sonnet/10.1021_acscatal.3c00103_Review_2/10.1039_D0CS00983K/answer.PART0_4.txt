[1] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[4] "Moreover, the Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."

[5] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Redispersion of sintered Pt particles using air regeneration in the presence of halides, particularly chlorine.

2. Addition of a second metal to form alloys with Pt, anchoring the particles to the carrier surface and preventing migration and coalescence.

3. Use of carriers with strong interactions with Pt, such as Al2O3, where coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites can anchor Pt particles.

4. Application of Al2O3 overcoats through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering of Pt nanoparticles.

5. Support of Pt on CeO2, which can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Improving sintering resistance and maintaining catalyst activity over longer periods.
2. Enhancing metal-support interactions to stabilize active metal particles.
3. Utilizing novel fabrication techniques like atomic layer deposition for precise control of catalyst structure.
4. Exploring new support materials with unique properties to stabilize active metal species.

These strategies aim to prolong catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles in industrial applications. By addressing the key issues of sintering and deactivation, these approaches contribute to more efficient and cost-effective dehydrogenation processes.
