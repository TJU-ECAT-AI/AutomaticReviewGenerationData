[1] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."

[2] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."

[3] "The addition of the second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[4] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[5] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Improving coking resistance to prolong time between regenerations. This can be done by introducing small amounts of H2O, though this may decrease conversion.

2. Adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt, anchoring Pt particles to the carrier surface and improving sintering resistance.

3. Using carriers with strong interactions with Pt, such as Al2O3, where coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ can anchor Pt.

4. Supporting Pt on CeO2, which can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state.

5. Optimizing catalyst composition and preparation methods to achieve better dispersion and stability of active metal particles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by focusing on prolonging catalyst lifetime, maintaining high activity and selectivity, and reducing the need for frequent regeneration. They aim to optimize performance for industrial applications by balancing factors like coking resistance, sintering resistance, and catalytic activity.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 提高抗积炭能力以延长再生周期。这可以通过引入少量H2O来实现，但可能会降低转化率。

2. 添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金，将Pt颗粒锚定在载体表面，提高抗烧结能力。

3. 使用与Pt具有强相互作用的载体，如Al2O3，其中配位不饱和的五配位Al3+可以锚定Pt。

4. 将Pt负载在CeO2上，CeO2能够将Pt以原子分散状态捕获。

5. 优化催化剂组成和制备方法，以获得更好的活性金属颗粒分散度和稳定性。

这些进展通过关注延长催化剂寿命、保持高活性和选择性以及减少频繁再生的需求来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在通过平衡抗积炭能力、抗烧结能力和催化活性等因素来优化工业应用性能。
