[1] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[4] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."

[5] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state. The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Redispersion of sintered Pt particles using halides (typically chlorine) during regeneration with air, rather than simple coke burning.

2. Addition of a second metal to form alloys with Pt, anchoring the particles to the carrier surface and preventing migration and coalescence.

3. Use of carriers with strong interactions with Pt, such as Al2O3, where coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites can anchor Pt particles.

4. Application of Al2O3 overcoats through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering of Pt nanoparticles.

5. Supporting Pt on CeO2, which can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, likely as Pt2+ bonded to step edges on the CeO2 surface.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by focusing on preventing sintering and maintaining high dispersion of active metal particles. This helps to maintain catalyst activity and selectivity over longer periods, which is crucial for industrial applications where catalyst lifetime and stability directly impact process economics and efficiency.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性所开发的策略包括：

1. 在空气再生过程中使用卤化物（通常是氯）重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒，而不是简单的焦炭燃烧。

2. 添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金，将颗粒锚定在载体表面，防止迁移和聚结。

3. 使用与Pt具有强相互作用的载体，如Al2O3，其中配位不饱和的五配位Al3+位点可以锚定Pt颗粒。

4. 通过原子层沉积技术应用Al2O3覆盖层，防止Pt纳米颗粒的烧结。

5. 将Pt负载在CeO2上，CeO2能够将Pt捕获在原子分散状态，可能以Pt2+的形式结合在CeO2表面的台阶边缘。

这些进展通过关注防止烧结和维持活性金属颗粒的高分散度，解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战。这有助于在更长时间内保持催化剂的活性和选择性，对于催化剂寿命和稳定性直接影响工艺经济性和效率的工业应用而言，这一点至关重要。
