[1] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[4] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons. The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."

[5] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt, which anchors Pt particles to the carrier surface and prevents sintering.

2. Using carriers with strong interactions with Pt, such as Al2O3, where coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites can anchor Pt and reduce migration.

3. Developing catalysts that can be regenerated without oxychlorination, like PtSn/CeO2, which can be fully regenerated by simple coke burning.

4. Understanding and addressing the two stages of coking deactivation - quick deactivation and steady state.

5. For commercial Pt catalysts, using air regeneration in the presence of halides (usually chlorine) to redisperse sintered Pt particles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving sintering resistance, simplifying regeneration processes, and targeting specific deactivation mechanisms. They aim to optimize catalyst performance and longevity for industrial applications by maintaining metal dispersion, reducing the need for harsh regeneration treatments, and mitigating coking issues.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 添加第二种金属与铂形成合金，将铂颗粒锚定在载体表面，防止烧结。

2. 使用与铂有强相互作用的载体，如Al2O3，其中配位不饱和的五配位Al3+位点可以锚定铂并减少迁移。

3. 开发无需氯化再生的催化剂，如PtSn/CeO2，可通过简单的积碳燃烧完全再生。

4. 理解并解决积碳失活的两个阶段 - 快速失活和稳态。

5. 对于商业铂催化剂，在卤化物（通常是氯）存在下使用空气再生来重新分散烧结的铂颗粒。

这些进展通过改善抗烧结性能、简化再生过程和针对特定失活机制来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在通过维持金属分散度、减少harsh再生处理的需求和缓解积碳问题来优化催化剂性能和寿命，以适应工业应用。
