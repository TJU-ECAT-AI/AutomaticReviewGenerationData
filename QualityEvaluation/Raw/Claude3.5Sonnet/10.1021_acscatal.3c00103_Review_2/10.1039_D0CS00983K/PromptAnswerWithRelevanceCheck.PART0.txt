[1] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[4] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."

[5] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state. The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Redispersion of sintered Pt particles using halides (typically chlorine) during regeneration with air, rather than simple coke burning.

2. Addition of a second metal to form alloys with Pt, anchoring the particles to the carrier surface and preventing migration and coalescence.

3. Use of carriers with strong interactions with Pt, such as Al2O3, where coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites can anchor Pt particles.

4. Application of Al2O3 overcoats through atomic layer deposition to prevent sintering of Pt nanoparticles.

5. Supporting Pt on CeO2, which can trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, likely as Pt2+ bonded to step edges on the CeO2 surface.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by focusing on preventing sintering and maintaining high dispersion of active metal particles. This helps to maintain catalyst activity and selectivity over longer periods, which is crucial for industrial applications where catalyst lifetime and stability directly impact process economics and efficiency.

[4] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons. The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."

[5] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state. The loss of activity cannot be simply correlated with the amount and nature of coke deposited."
