[1] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[2] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with inactive metals to dilute large Pt-Pt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions.

2. Isolating Pt atoms using second metals to maximize the ensemble effect, favoring desired CH scissions while inhibiting subsequent undesired reactions.

3. Tuning the electronic properties of Pt to increase its electron density, promoting product desorption and improving stability.

4. A novel "double decoration" concept, exemplified by modifying PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This combines geometric and electronic promotion effects without altering the parent structure.

5. Using hydrogen co-feeding to suppress coke formation and dramatically improve catalytic stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Minimizing side reactions and coke formation
- Enhancing thermal stability to prevent sintering at high temperatures
- Prolonging catalyst lifetime, reducing the need for frequent regeneration
- Improving selectivity towards desired products

The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst developed using these strategies demonstrated unprecedented stability in propane dehydrogenation, maintaining activity for up to a month at 600°C. This represents a significant step towards optimizing catalysts for industrial applications, potentially reducing downtime and improving process efficiency.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 将铂与惰性金属合金化，以稀释大型铂-铂集合体，这些集合体已知会激活不需要的副反应。

2. 使用第二种金属隔离铂原子以最大化集合效应，有利于所需的C-H断裂，同时抑制后续不需要的反应。

3. 调节铂的电子性质以增加其电子密度，促进产物脱附并提高稳定性。

4. 一种新颖的"双重装饰"概念，以用铅和钙修饰PtGa金属间化合物为例。这结合了几何和电子促进效应，而不改变母体结构。

5. 使用氢气共进料来抑制积碳形成，显著提高催化稳定性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：

- 最小化副反应和积碳形成
- 提高热稳定性，防止在高温下烧结
- 延长催化剂寿命，减少频繁再生的需求
- 提高对目标产物的选择性

使用这些策略开发的PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出前所未有的稳定性，在600°C下保持活性长达一个月。这代表了催化剂优化用于工业应用的重要一步，有可能减少停机时间并提高工艺效率。
