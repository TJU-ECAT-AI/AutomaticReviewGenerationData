[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage. However, a high reaction temperature (>600C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield because of the high endothermicity of PDH. Thus, the Pt-based catalysts are inevitably deactivated by coking and/or nanoparticle sintering at such a high temperature and must be regenerated in short cycles."

[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one. Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on several key strategies:

1. Alloying of platinum: This approach aims to dilute large PtPt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions. By alloying Pt with inactive metals, the ensemble effect is maximized, favoring desired CH scissions while inhibiting side reactions.

2. Intermetallic compounds: The use of thermally stable intermetallic compounds, such as PtGa, has been explored to create isolated Pt sites that can withstand high temperatures without sintering.

3. Electronic tuning: Increasing the electron density of Pt has been found to promote propylene desorption and improve stability by inducing electrostatic repulsion.

4. Double decoration strategy: A novel approach involving the modification of intermetallic compounds (e.g., PtGa) with two different elements (e.g., Pb and Ca) has been developed. This strategy combines geometric and electronic promotion effects to enhance catalytic stability significantly.

5. Selective site blocking: Deposition of elements like Pb on specific sites (e.g., Pt3 sites) can selectively block undesired reaction pathways while leaving the desired active sites (e.g., Pt1 sites) available for the main reaction.

These advancements address several challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization:

1. High-temperature stability: By creating more stable structures and preventing sintering, these strategies allow catalysts to operate at the high temperatures required for sufficient propylene yield.

2. Coke formation: The improved electronic properties and selective site blocking help reduce coke formation, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

3. Longevity: The synergistic effects of geometric and electronic modifications have resulted in catalysts with unprecedented stability, capable of operating for up to a month at 600°C without significant deactivation.

4. Selectivity: By tuning the geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst, these strategies enhance selectivity towards the desired product (propylene) while suppressing side reactions.

5. Regeneration cycles: The improved stability reduces the frequency of regeneration cycles, which is crucial for industrial applications as it increases process efficiency and reduces downtime.

These advancements represent significant progress in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes, potentially enabling more efficient and economical industrial applications in the production of important chemicals like propylene.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中催化剂稳定性方面的进展主要集中在以下几个关键策略：

1. 铂的合金化：这种方法旨在稀释大的PtPt集合体，这些集合体已知会激活不需要的副反应。通过将Pt与非活性金属合金化，最大化了集合效应，有利于所需的CH断裂，同时抑制副反应。

2. 金属间化合物：探索使用热稳定性好的金属间化合物（如PtGa）来创建能够承受高温而不发生烧结的孤立Pt位点。

3. 电子调节：增加Pt的电子密度被发现可以促进丙烯的脱附并通过诱导静电排斥来提高稳定性。

4. 双重修饰策略：开发了一种新方法，涉及用两种不同的元素（如Pb和Ca）修饰金属间化合物（如PtGa）。这种策略结合了几何和电子促进效应，显著提高了催化稳定性。

5. 选择性位点阻断：在特定位点（如Pt3位点）沉积元素（如Pb）可以选择性地阻断不需要的反应路径，同时保留主要反应所需的活性位点（如Pt1位点）。

这些进展解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的几个挑战：

1. 高温稳定性：通过创建更稳定的结构并防止烧结，这些策略使催化剂能够在获得足够丙烯产率所需的高温下运行。

2. 积碳形成：改进的电子性质和选择性位点阻断有助于减少积碳形成，这是催化剂失活的主要原因。

3. 寿命：几何和电子修饰的协同效应产生了具有前所未有稳定性的催化剂，能够在600°C下运行长达一个月而不会显著失活。

4. 选择性：通过调节催化剂的几何和电子性质，这些策略增强了对所需产物（丙烯）的选择性，同时抑制了副反应。

5. 再生周期：改进的稳定性减少了再生周期的频率，这对工业应用至关重要，因为它提高了工艺效率并减少了停机时间。

这些进展代表了直接脱氢过程催化剂设计的重大进步，有可能实现更高效、更经济的工业应用，尤其是在生产丙烯等重要化学品方面。
