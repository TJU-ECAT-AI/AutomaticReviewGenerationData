[1] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[2] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability. PtGaCaPb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts"

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include several key strategies:

1. Alloying of platinum with inactive metals to create an ensemble effect, which helps prevent side reactions by diluting large Pt-Pt ensembles.

2. Isolating platinum atoms using second metals to favor desired C-H scissions while inhibiting undesired reactions.

3. Tuning the electronic properties of platinum to increase its electron density, promoting product desorption and improving stability.

4. A novel "double decoration" concept, exemplified by modifying PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This approach synergizes geometric and electronic promotion effects without altering the parent structure.

5. Co-feeding hydrogen to decrease coke formation and improve catalytic stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Minimizing side reactions and coking through geometric modifications.
2. Enhancing stability at high temperatures by tuning electronic properties.
3. Combining multiple strategies (e.g., double decoration) to achieve synergistic effects.
4. Optimizing reaction conditions (e.g., co-feeding H2) to further improve stability.

The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst developed using these strategies demonstrated exceptional stability for up to one month at 600°C, marking a significant improvement over previously reported catalysts for industrial applications.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展包括几个关键策略：

1. 将铂与非活性金属合金化，创造集合效应，有助于通过稀释大的Pt-Pt集合来防止副反应。

2. 使用第二种金属隔离铂原子，有利于所需的C-H断裂，同时抑制不需要的反应。

3. 调节铂的电子性质以增加其电子密度，促进产物脱附并提高稳定性。

4. 一种新颖的"双重修饰"概念，以用Pb和Ca修饰PtGa金属间化合物为例。这种方法在不改变母体结构的情况下协同几何和电子促进效应。

5. 共进料氢气以减少积碳并提高催化稳定性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：

1. 通过几何修饰最小化副反应和积碳。
2. 通过调节电子性质提高高温下的稳定性。
3. 结合多种策略（如双重修饰）以实现协同效应。
4. 优化反应条件（如共进料H2）以进一步提高稳定性。

使用这些策略开发的PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下展示了长达一个月的卓越稳定性，标志着在工业应用方面相较于先前报道的催化剂有了显著改进。
