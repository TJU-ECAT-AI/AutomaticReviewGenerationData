[1] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[2] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability. PtGaCaPb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts"

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include several key strategies:

1. Alloying of platinum with inactive metals to create an ensemble effect, which helps prevent side reactions by diluting large Pt-Pt ensembles.

2. Isolating platinum atoms using second metals to favor desired C-H scissions while inhibiting undesired reactions.

3. Tuning the electronic properties of platinum to increase its electron density, promoting product desorption and improving stability.

4. A novel "double decoration" concept, exemplified by modifying PtGa intermetallics with Pb and Ca. This approach synergizes geometric and electronic promotion effects without altering the parent structure.

5. Co-feeding hydrogen to decrease coke formation and improve catalytic stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Minimizing side reactions and coking through geometric modifications.
2. Enhancing stability at high temperatures by tuning electronic properties.
3. Combining multiple strategies (e.g., double decoration) to achieve synergistic effects.
4. Optimizing reaction conditions (e.g., co-feeding H2) to further improve stability.

The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst developed using these strategies demonstrated exceptional stability for up to one month at 600°C, marking a significant improvement over previously reported catalysts for industrial applications.

[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage. However, a high reaction temperature (>600C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield because of the high endothermicity of PDH. Thus, the Pt-based catalysts are inevitably deactivated by coking and/or nanoparticle sintering at such a high temperature and must be regenerated in short cycles."

[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one. Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied."

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on several key strategies:

1. Alloying of platinum: This approach aims to dilute large PtPt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions. By alloying Pt with inactive metals, the ensemble effect is maximized, favoring desired CH scissions while inhibiting side reactions.

2. Intermetallic compounds: The use of thermally stable intermetallic compounds, such as PtGa, has been explored to create isolated Pt sites that can withstand high temperatures without sintering.

3. Electronic tuning: Increasing the electron density of Pt has been found to promote propylene desorption and improve stability by inducing electrostatic repulsion.

4. Double decoration strategy: A novel approach involving the modification of intermetallic compounds (e.g., PtGa) with two different elements (e.g., Pb and Ca) has been developed. This strategy combines geometric and electronic promotion effects to enhance catalytic stability significantly.

5. Selective site blocking: Deposition of elements like Pb on specific sites (e.g., Pt3 sites) can selectively block undesired reaction pathways while leaving the desired active sites (e.g., Pt1 sites) available for the main reaction.

These advancements address several challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization:

1. High-temperature stability: By creating more stable structures and preventing sintering, these strategies allow catalysts to operate at the high temperatures required for sufficient propylene yield.

2. Coke formation: The improved electronic properties and selective site blocking help reduce coke formation, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

3. Longevity: The synergistic effects of geometric and electronic modifications have resulted in catalysts with unprecedented stability, capable of operating for up to a month at 600°C without significant deactivation.

4. Selectivity: By tuning the geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst, these strategies enhance selectivity towards the desired product (propylene) while suppressing side reactions.

5. Regeneration cycles: The improved stability reduces the frequency of regeneration cycles, which is crucial for industrial applications as it increases process efficiency and reduces downtime.

These advancements represent significant progress in catalyst design for direct dehydrogenation processes, potentially enabling more efficient and economical industrial applications in the production of important chemicals like propylene.
