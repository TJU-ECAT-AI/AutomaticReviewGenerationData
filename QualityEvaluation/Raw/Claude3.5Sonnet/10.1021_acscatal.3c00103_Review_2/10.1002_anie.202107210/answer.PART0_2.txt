[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage. However, a high reaction temperature (>600C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield because of the high endothermicity of PDH. Thus, the Pt-based catalysts are inevitably deactivated by coking and/or nanoparticle sintering at such a high temperature and must be regenerated in short cycles."

[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one. Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts"

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability for direct dehydrogenation processes focus on several key strategies:

1. Alloying of platinum: This approach aims to dilute large Pt-Pt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions. By alloying Pt with inactive metals like Sn, Ga, In, or Zn, the ensemble effect is maximized, favoring desired reactions while inhibiting side reactions.

2. Isolated platinum sites: Designing catalysts with isolated Pt atoms, such as single-atom alloys or intermetallic compounds, has shown promise in improving selectivity and stability at high temperatures.

3. Double decoration of intermetallics: A novel approach involves modifying intermetallic compounds (e.g., PtGa) with two elements serving different purposes. For instance, decorating PtGa with Pb for geometric modification and Ca for electronic modification has resulted in synergistic effects, greatly enhancing catalyst stability.

4. Tuning electronic properties: Increasing the electron density of Pt sites can improve stability by promoting the desorption of products like propylene, reducing the likelihood of side reactions and coking.

5. Thermal stability: Developing catalysts that can withstand high temperatures (>600°C) without sintering or deactivation is crucial for long-term stability in industrial applications.

These strategies address key challenges in catalyst design by:

- Minimizing coking and sintering at high temperatures
- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Extending catalyst lifetime and reducing the need for frequent regeneration
- Enhancing overall process efficiency and economics

The development of catalysts like PtGaCaPb/SiO2, which demonstrated month-long stability at 600°C, represents a significant advancement in addressing these challenges for industrial applications of direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中催化剂稳定性方面的进展主要集中在几个关键策略：

1. 铂的合金化：这种方法旨在稀释大的Pt-Pt集合体，因为这些集合体已知会激活不希望的副反应。通过将Pt与Sn、Ga、In或Zn等惰性金属合金化，可以最大化集合效应，有利于所需反应，同时抑制副反应。

2. 孤立的铂位点：设计具有孤立Pt原子的催化剂，如单原子合金或金属间化合物，在高温下提高选择性和稳定性方面表现出潜力。

3. 金属间化合物的双重修饰：一种新颖的方法涉及用两种元素修饰金属间化合物（如PtGa），这两种元素具有不同的用途。例如，用Pb修饰PtGa以进行几何修饰，用Ca进行电子修饰，产生了协同效应，大大提高了催化剂的稳定性。

4. 调节电子性质：增加Pt位点的电子密度可以通过促进产物（如丙烯）的脱附来提高稳定性，从而减少副反应和结焦的可能性。

5. 热稳定性：开发能够在高温（>600°C）下耐受而不发生烧结或失活的催化剂，对于工业应用中的长期稳定性至关重要。

这些策略通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的关键挑战：

- 最大限度地减少高温下的结焦和烧结
- 提高对所需产品的选择性
- 延长催化剂寿命并减少频繁再生的需求
- 提高整体过程效率和经济性

像PtGaCaPb/SiO2这样的催化剂的开发，在600°C下展示了长达一个月的稳定性，代表了在解决直接脱氢过程工业应用这些挑战方面的重大进展。
