[1] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[2] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability. PtGaCaPb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts"

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on several key strategies:

1. Alloying of platinum with inactive metals to create an ensemble effect, which helps prevent side reactions by diluting large PtPt ensembles.

2. Isolating platinum atoms using second metals to favor specific CH scissions while inhibiting others, thereby improving selectivity and stability.

3. Tuning the electronic properties of platinum to increase its electron density, which promotes propylene desorption and improves stability by reducing coke formation.

4. Developing a novel "double decoration" concept, where intermetallic compounds (e.g., PtGa) are modified with two elements (e.g., Pb and Ca) to synergize geometric and electronic promotion effects without altering the parent structure.

5. Co-feeding hydrogen to suppress coke accumulation, which significantly improves catalytic stability.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design by focusing on both geometric and electronic effects to optimize performance. The double decoration concept, in particular, represents a breakthrough in fabricating ultra-stable catalysts for industrial applications, achieving month-long stability at high temperatures (600°C) for propane dehydrogenation. This approach opens new possibilities for enhancing the catalytic performance of intermetallics in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展集中在几个关键策略上：

1. 将铂与惰性金属合金化以创造集合效应，这有助于通过稀释大的PtPt集合来防止副反应。

2. 使用第二种金属隔离铂原子，以有利于特定的CH断裂，同时抑制其他断裂，从而提高选择性和稳定性。

3. 调节铂的电子性质以增加其电子密度，这促进了丙烯的脱附并通过减少积炭形成来提高稳定性。

4. 开发新颖的"双重装饰"概念，其中金属间化合物（如PtGa）用两种元素（如Pb和Ca）进行修饰，以协同几何和电子促进效应，而不改变母体结构。

5. 共进料氢气以抑制积炭积累，这显著提高了催化稳定性。

这些策略通过关注几何和电子效应来优化性能，从而解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。特别是双重装饰概念代表了制造用于工业应用的超稳定催化剂的突破，在高温（600°C）下实现了长达一个月的丙烷脱氢稳定性。这种方法为提高金属间化合物在烷烃脱氢过程中的催化性能开辟了新的可能性。
