[1] "To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13)."

[2] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

[3] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

[4] "A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Optimization of metal ratios: Using large quantities of Sn relative to Pt (Sn:Pt between 4 and 5) to increase the yield of intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles.

2. Feed composition modification: Adding hydrogen to the reactant feed to reduce catalyst deactivation rates.

3. Novel catalyst design: Developing silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles that can operate without hydrogen addition while maintaining high stability and selectivity.

4. Improved synthesis methods: Starting with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex to ensure atomic-level mixing of Pt and Sn, which is preserved during reduction and reaction.

5. Support selection: Using SiO2 as a support to promote benign interactions with the metal nanoparticles, preventing Pt-Sn segregation and SnOx formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving metal dispersion, preventing phase segregation, and enhancing stability under reaction conditions. They also optimize performance by allowing operation at thermodynamic limits without sacrificing selectivity or requiring feed dilution, which is beneficial for industrial applications.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 金属比例优化：使用大量的Sn相对于Pt（Sn:Pt比例在4到5之间），以增加金属间化合物PtSn纳米粒子的产率。

2. 进料组成修改：向反应物料中添加氢气，以降低催化剂失活速率。

3. 新型催化剂设计：开发二氧化硅负载的Pt1Sn1纳米粒子，可在不添加氢气的情况下运行，同时保持高稳定性和选择性。

4. 改进的合成方法：从异金属Pt-Sn配位络合物开始，确保Pt和Sn在原子层面的混合，并在还原和反应过程中保持这种状态。

5. 载体选择：使用SiO2作为载体，促进与金属纳米粒子的良性相互作用，防止Pt-Sn分离和SnOx的形成。

这些进展通过改善金属分散性、防止相分离和提高反应条件下的稳定性来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们还通过允许在热力学极限下运行而不牺牲选择性或需要进料稀释来优化性能，这对工业应用有利。
