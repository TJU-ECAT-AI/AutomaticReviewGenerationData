[1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

[2] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

[3] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

[4] "We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on several key strategies:

1. Atomic-level mixing: Developing catalysts with atomically mixed precursors, such as heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complexes, ensures that the active metal and promoter are in immediate contact from the start.

2. Nanoparticle size control: Synthesizing very small intermetallic nanoparticles (less than 2 nm diameter) helps maintain high dispersion and stability of the active phase.

3. Support selection: Using supports like silica (SiO2) that have benign interactions with the metal nanoparticles prevents segregation of the active components and formation of unwanted oxide phases.

4. Precise composition control: Optimizing the ratio of active metal to promoter (e.g., Pt1Sn1) to achieve the desired intermetallic phase and prevent excess inactive material.

5. Pretreatment methods: Developing synthesis and pretreatment procedures that preserve the mixing of active components during reduction and catalytic operation.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design and fabrication by promoting the formation of stable, well-dispersed intermetallic phases that resist deactivation and maintain high activity and selectivity. For industrial applications, these advancements result in catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits without the need for feed dilution or excess promoter, leading to improved process efficiency and catalyst longevity.
