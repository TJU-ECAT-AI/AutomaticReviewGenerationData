          [1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

          [2] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

          [3] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

          [4] "We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs."

          [5] "Even under these harsh, high-conversion and undiluted propane stream conditions, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was stable and operated at the thermodynamic conversion limit and >99% selectivity for at least 30 hours on stream, whereas the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (commercial mimic) deactivated rapidly under these conditions"

          [6] "To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13)."

          Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

          1. Development of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles (NPs) that operate at thermodynamic conversion limits without hydrogen addition, showing excellent stability and selectivity (>99%) to propylene.

          2. Novel synthesis approach starting with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex to ensure atomic-level mixing of Pt and Sn, which is preserved during reduction and catalytic operation.

          3. Formation of very small (< 2 nm) intermetallic PtSn NPs upon reduction, maintaining high dispersion and stability of the active phase.

          4. Utilization of SiO2 as a support, which provides benign interactions with the PtSn NPs, preventing Pt-Sn segregation and SnOx phase formation.

          5. Precise control of Pt:Sn ratio (1:1) on silica support, in contrast to the higher Sn:Pt ratios (between 4 and 5) used in traditional catalysts.

          6. Optimization of metal-support interactions to enhance overall catalyst performance and stability.

          These strategies address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

          - Improving stability, selectivity, and conversion efficiency without the need for feed dilution or excess promoter.
          - Preventing metal segregation and oxide formation during operation.
          - Maintaining high dispersion and small particle size of the active phase.
          - Allowing operation at higher conversions with improved stability and selectivity.
          - Eliminating the need for hydrogen addition to the feed, which improves process efficiency.

          The approach demonstrates potential for industrial applications by operating at thermodynamic limits with undiluted feedstock and maintaining performance over extended periods (at least 30 hours), outperforming commercial mimics.

          最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展包括：

          1. 开发了二氧化硅负载的Pt1Sn1纳米粒子（NPs），在不添加氢气的情况下在热力学转化极限下运行，表现出优异的稳定性和对丙烯的高选择性（>99%）。

          2. 新型合成方法从异金属Pt-Sn配位络合物开始，确保Pt和Sn的原子级混合，并在还原和催化操作过程中保持这种状态。

          3. 还原后形成非常小（< 2 nm）的金属间PtSn纳米粒子，保持活性相的高分散性和稳定性。

          4. 利用SiO2作为载体，与PtSn纳米粒子提供良性相互作用，防止Pt-Sn分离和SnOx相的形成。

          5. 在二氧化硅载体上精确控制Pt:Sn比例（1:1），这与传统催化剂中使用的较高Sn:Pt比例（4到5之间）形成对比。

          6. 优化金属-载体相互作用以提高整体催化剂性能和稳定性。

          这些策略通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化中的挑战：

          - 在不需要进料稀释或过量助剂的情况下提高稳定性、选择性和转化效率。
          - 防止操作过程中的金属分离和氧化物形成。
          - 保持活性相的高分散性和小粒径。
          - 允许在更高的转化率下运行，具有improved稳定性和选择性。
          - 消除了向进料中添加氢气的需求，提高了过程效率。

          该方法在未稀释原料的热力学极限下运行，并长期保持性能（至少30小时），性能优于商业模拟物，展示了工业应用的潜力。
