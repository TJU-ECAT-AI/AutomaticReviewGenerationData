[1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

[2] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

[3] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

[4] "We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs."

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes involve several key strategies:

1. Development of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles (NPs) that operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without hydrogen addition, showing excellent stability and selectivity.

2. Synthesis of catalysts starting with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring immediate contact between Pt and Sn atoms, which is maintained during reduction and reaction.

3. Formation of very small (< 2 nm) intermetallic PtSn NPs upon reduction, preserving the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn.

4. Utilization of SiO2 as a support, which provides benign interactions with the PtSn NPs, preventing segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of SnOx phase.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Improving stability and selectivity without the need for hydrogen addition or excess tin.
2. Preventing metal segregation and oxide formation during operation.
3. Maintaining high dispersion and small particle size of the active phase.
4. Optimizing metal-support interactions to enhance overall catalyst performance.

These strategies result in catalysts that can operate at higher conversions with improved stability and selectivity, potentially leading to more efficient and productive industrial processes for propane dehydrogenation.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展涉及几个关键策略：

1. 开发了二氧化硅负载的Pt1Sn1纳米粒子（NPs），在不添加氢气的情况下在热力学限制的转化水平下运行，表现出优异的稳定性和选择性。

2. 合成催化剂时从异金属Pt-Sn配位络合物开始，确保Pt和Sn原子之间的直接接触，并在还原和反应过程中保持这种相互作用。

3. 还原后形成非常小（< 2 nm）的金属间PtSn纳米粒子，保持Pt和Sn的原子混合。

4. 利用SiO2作为载体，与PtSn纳米粒子提供良性相互作用，防止Pt和Sn的分离和SnOx相的形成。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：

1. 在不需要添加氢气或过量锡的情况下提高稳定性和选择性。
2. 防止操作过程中的金属分离和氧化物形成。
