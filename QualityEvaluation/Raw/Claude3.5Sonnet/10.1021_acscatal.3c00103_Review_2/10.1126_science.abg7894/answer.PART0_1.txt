[1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

[2] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

[3] "A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

[4] "Even under these harsh, high-conversion and undiluted propane stream conditions, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was stable and operated at the thermodynamic conversion limit and >99% selectivity for at least 30 hours on stream, whereas the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (commercial mimic) deactivated rapidly under these conditions"

[5] "We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs."

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Development of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles (NPs) that operate at thermodynamic conversion limits without hydrogen addition, showing excellent stability and selectivity.

2. Synthesis strategy starting with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex to ensure Pt and Sn mixing is preserved during reduction and reaction.

3. Utilization of SiO2 as a support, which provides benign interactions with the NPs, preventing Pt-Sn segregation and SnOx phase formation.

4. Achieving high stability under harsh conditions (high-conversion, undiluted propane) for extended periods, outperforming commercial mimics.

5. Leveraging favorable interactions among support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt) to maintain a high degree of atomic mixing in small intermetallic PtSn NPs.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by improving stability, selectivity, and conversion efficiency without the need for feed dilution or excess promoter. The approach demonstrates potential for industrial applications by operating at thermodynamic limits with undiluted feedstock and maintaining performance over extended periods.
