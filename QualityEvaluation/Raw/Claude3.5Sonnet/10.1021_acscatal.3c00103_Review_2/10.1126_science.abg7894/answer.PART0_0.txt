[1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

[2] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

[3] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

[4] "We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on several key strategies:

1. Atomic-level mixing: Developing catalysts with atomically mixed precursors, such as heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complexes, ensures that the active metal and promoter are in immediate contact from the start.

2. Nanoparticle size control: Synthesizing very small intermetallic nanoparticles (less than 2 nm diameter) helps maintain high dispersion and stability of the active phase.

3. Support selection: Using supports like silica (SiO2) that have benign interactions with the metal nanoparticles prevents segregation of the active components and formation of unwanted oxide phases.

4. Precise composition control: Optimizing the ratio of active metal to promoter (e.g., Pt1Sn1) to achieve the desired intermetallic phase and prevent excess inactive material.

5. Pretreatment methods: Developing synthesis and pretreatment procedures that preserve the mixing of active components during reduction and catalytic operation.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design and fabrication by promoting the formation of stable, well-dispersed intermetallic phases that resist deactivation and maintain high activity and selectivity. For industrial applications, these advancements result in catalysts that can operate at thermodynamic limits without the need for feed dilution or excess promoter, leading to improved process efficiency and catalyst longevity.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展主要集中在以下几个关键策略：

1. 原子级混合：开发具有原子混合前体的催化剂，如异金属Pt-Sn配位络合物，确保活性金属和促进剂从一开始就紧密接触。

2. 纳米粒子尺寸控制：合成非常小的金属间化合物纳米粒子（直径小于2纳米），有助于保持活性相的高度分散和稳定性。

3. 载体选择：使用与金属纳米粒子有良性相互作用的载体，如二氧化硅（SiO2），防止活性组分的分离和不需要的氧化物相的形成。

4. 精确的成分控制：优化活性金属与促进剂的比例（如Pt1Sn1），以获得所需的金属间化合物相，并防止过量的非活性材料。

5. 预处理方法：开发能在还原和催化操作过程中保持活性组分混合的合成和预处理程序。

这些策略通过促进稳定、分散良好的金属间化合物相的形成来解决催化剂设计和制造方面的挑战，这些相能够抵抗失活并保持高活性和选择性。对于工业应用，这些进展产生的催化剂可以在热力学极限下运行，而无需稀释进料或使用过量的促进剂，从而提高了过程效率和催化剂寿命。
