Recent advancements in strategies for enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes have shown promising results in addressing long-standing fabrication challenges and optimizing performance. Researchers have focused on developing novel support materials, such as high-surface-area metal oxides and carbon-based structures, which provide better dispersion and anchoring of metal nanoparticles. Additionally, innovative synthesis methods, including atomic layer deposition and controlled surface functionalization, have enabled more precise control over catalyst morphology and composition. These approaches have led to improved resistance against sintering and coking, two major factors contributing to catalyst deactivation. Furthermore, the incorporation of promoters and the design of bimetallic systems have demonstrated synergistic effects, enhancing both activity and stability. Optimized reaction conditions, such as controlled feed composition and temperature management, have also played a crucial role in extending catalyst lifetimes. As a result of these advancements, supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes are now capable of maintaining high selectivity and conversion rates over extended periods, leading to more efficient and economically viable industrial applications.
