If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically about the deactivation and regeneration of Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The document focuses on coke formation and deactivation of Pt and PtSn catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts or regeneration methods involving reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically about the causes of deactivation for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, nor does it discuss regeneration methods using air, CO2, or O2 for these catalyst types. The document focuses on coke formation and deactivation of Pt and PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which is a different process. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered using the provided text.

The given literature does not contain information about the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts. It also does not discuss various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, or their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The document does not mention anything about the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The literature primarily focuses on coke formation during propane dehydrogenation over Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. It discusses different types of coke formation, the effect of reaction conditions on coke formation, and the impact of coke on catalyst deactivation. The document does not address the specific aspects of metal oxide catalysts or oxidative dehydrogenation processes mentioned in the question.
