[1] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream."

[2] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."

[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in Fig. S4. We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered."

[4] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation
2. Decreased dispersion of metal species due to aggregation

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours, but unable to fully recover catalyst activity.

2. Air regeneration: Conducted at 500°C, also unable to fully recover initial catalyst activity.

Both regeneration methods were ineffective in completely restoring catalyst performance. The document does not provide information on O2 regeneration or the impact of CO2 addition on mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The effectiveness of regeneration methods appears limited, as neither CO2 nor air regeneration could fully restore catalyst activity. Temperature requirements for both methods were similar (around 500°C). The impact on catalytic performance was negative, as the regenerated catalysts showed lower activity compared to their initial state.

The document does not provide specific information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对Cr基催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳形成
2. 由于金属物种聚集导致的分散度降低

关于再生方法：

1. CO2再生：在496 ± 3°C下进行3小时，但无法完全恢复催化剂活性。

2. 空气再生：在500°C下进行，同样无法完全恢复催化剂的初始活性。

两种再生方法都无法完全恢复催化剂性能。文献中没有提供关于O2再生或CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的缓解作用的信息。

再生方法的有效性似乎有限，因为无论是CO2还是空气再生都无法完全恢复催化剂活性。两种方法的温度要求相似（约500°C）。对催化性能的影响是负面的，因为再生后的催化剂显示出比初始状态更低的活性。

文献中没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在缓解作用的具体信息。
