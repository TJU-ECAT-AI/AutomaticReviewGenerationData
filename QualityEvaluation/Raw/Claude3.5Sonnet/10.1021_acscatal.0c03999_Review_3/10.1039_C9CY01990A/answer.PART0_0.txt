[1] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream."

[2] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."

[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in Fig. S4."

[4] "We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered."

[5] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.

2. Aggregation of active species: The decreased dispersion of Cr species due to sintering or clustering.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours. This method was not fully effective in recovering catalyst activity.

2. Air regeneration: Conducted at 500°C. This method also failed to fully restore the initial catalyst activity.

Both regeneration methods showed limited effectiveness in recovering the catalyst's original performance. The temperature requirements for both methods were similar, around 500°C.

The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration was negative, as neither method could fully restore the initial activity. This suggests that the deactivation caused by aggregation of Cr species is not easily reversed by these regeneration processes.

The literature does not provide specific information about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, these aspects cannot be addressed based on the given information.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于基于铬的催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳形成：碳质沉积物在催化剂表面的累积。

2. 活性物种的团聚：由于烧结或聚集导致铬物种分散度降低。

关于再生方法：

1. CO2再生：在496 ± 3°C下进行3小时。这种方法无法完全恢复催化剂活性。

2. 空气再生：在500°C下进行。这种方法也未能完全恢复催化剂的初始活性。

两种再生方法在恢复催化剂原有性能方面的效果都有限。两种方法的温度要求相似，都在500°C左右。

再生后对催化性能的影响是负面的，因为两种方法都无法完全恢复初始活性。这表明由铬物种团聚造成的失活不容易通过这些再生过程逆转。

文献中没有提供关于钒氧化物催化剂或CO2添加减少钒氧化物催化反应过度氧化的具体信息。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论这些方面。
