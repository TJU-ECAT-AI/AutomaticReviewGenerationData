[1] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream."

[2] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."

[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in Fig. S4. We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered."

[4] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."

Based on the limited information provided in the literature, the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation for Cr-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes appear to be:

1. Coke formation
2. Decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation

The literature discusses two regeneration methods:

1. Regeneration in CO2 at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours
2. Regeneration in air at 500°C

Neither method was fully effective in recovering the initial catalytic activity. The CO2 regeneration method was tried first, followed by air regeneration, but both failed to completely restore the catalyst's performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance for various regeneration methods beyond these two examples. Additionally, there is no mention of VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The study focuses primarily on Ru-modified Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, and does not provide comprehensive information on regeneration methods or comparisons between different catalyst types.

根据文献提供的有限信息，Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因似乎是：

1. 积碳形成
2. 由于聚集导致Cr物种分散度降低

文献讨论了两种再生方法：

1. 在496 ± 3°C下用CO2再生3小时
2. 在500°C下用空气再生

这两种方法都无法完全恢复初始催化活性。先尝试了CO2再生方法，然后是空气再生，但两种方法都未能完全恢复催化剂的性能。

除了这两个例子，文献并未提供关于各种再生方法的有效性、温度要求或对催化性能影响的具体信息。此外，也没有提到VOx催化剂或CO2添加对减少VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在影响。

这项研究主要集中在用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的Ru改性Cr基催化剂上，并未提供关于再生方法或不同类型催化剂之间比较的全面信息。
