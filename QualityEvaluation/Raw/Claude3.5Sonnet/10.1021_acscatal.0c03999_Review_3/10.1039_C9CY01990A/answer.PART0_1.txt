[1] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream."

[2] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."

[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in Fig. S4. We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered."

[4] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation on the catalyst surface
2. Decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours, but unable to fully recover catalyst activity.
2. Air regeneration: Conducted at 500°C, also unable to fully restore initial catalyst activity.

Both regeneration methods were ineffective in completely restoring catalyst performance. The study did not provide information on O2 regeneration or the specific impact of CO2 addition on mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The effectiveness of regeneration methods appears limited, as neither CO2 nor air treatment could fully recover the initial catalytic activity. This suggests that the deactivation mechanism involves irreversible changes to the catalyst structure, likely due to the aggregation of Cr species, which cannot be easily reversed by simple reoxidation treatments.

The study does not provide specific information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对Cr基催化剂，包括：

1. 催化剂表面的积碳形成
2. 由于聚集导致Cr物种分散度下降

关于再生方法：

1. CO2再生：在496 ± 3°C下进行3小时，但无法完全恢复催化剂活性。
2. 空气再生：在500°C下进行，同样无法完全恢复初始催化剂活性。

两种再生方法都无法完全恢复催化剂性能。该研究没有提供关于O2再生或CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的具体影响的信息。

再生方法的有效性似乎有限，因为CO2和空气处理都无法完全恢复初始催化活性。这表明失活机制涉及催化剂结构的不可逆变化，可能是由于Cr物种的聚集，这无法通过简单的再氧化处理轻易逆转。

该研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在缓解作用的具体信息。
