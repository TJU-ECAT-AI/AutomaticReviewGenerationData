[1] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream."

[2] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."

[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in Fig. S4."

[4] "We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered."

[5] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.

2. Aggregation of active species: The decreased dispersion of Cr species due to sintering or clustering.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours. This method was not fully effective in recovering catalyst activity.

2. Air regeneration: Conducted at 500°C. This method also failed to fully restore the initial catalyst activity.

Both regeneration methods showed limited effectiveness in recovering the catalyst's original performance. The temperature requirements for both methods were similar, around 500°C.

The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration was negative, as neither method could fully restore the initial activity. This suggests that the deactivation caused by aggregation of Cr species is not easily reversed by these regeneration processes.

The literature does not provide specific information about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, these aspects cannot be addressed based on the given information.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于基于铬的催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳形成：碳质沉积物在催化剂表面的累积。

2. 活性物种的团聚：由于烧结或聚集导致铬物种分散度降低。

关于再生方法：

1. CO2再生：在496 ± 3°C下进行3小时。这种方法无法完全恢复催化剂活性。

2. 空气再生：在500°C下进行。这种方法也未能完全恢复催化剂的初始活性。

两种再生方法在恢复催化剂原有性能方面的效果都有限。两种方法的温度要求相似，都在500°C左右。

再生后对催化性能的影响是负面的，因为两种方法都无法完全恢复初始活性。这表明由铬物种团聚造成的失活不容易通过这些再生过程逆转。

文献中没有提供关于钒氧化物催化剂或CO2添加减少钒氧化物催化反应过度氧化的具体信息。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论这些方面。

1. Coke formation on the catalyst surface
2. Decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours, but unable to fully recover catalyst activity.

Both regeneration methods were ineffective in completely restoring catalyst performance. The study did not provide information on O2 regeneration or the specific impact of CO2 addition on mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The effectiveness of regeneration methods appears limited, as neither CO2 nor air treatment could fully recover the initial catalytic activity. This suggests that the deactivation mechanism involves irreversible changes to the catalyst structure, likely due to the aggregation of Cr species, which cannot be easily reversed by simple reoxidation treatments.

The study does not provide specific information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对Cr基催化剂，包括：

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods appears limited, as neither could fully recover the catalyst's initial activity. This suggests that some forms of deactivation, particularly the aggregation of Cr species, may be irreversible or require more aggressive regeneration conditions.

The temperature requirements for both methods were similar, around 500°C. However, the specific impact on catalytic performance was not detailed beyond the observation that full activity recovery was not achieved.

The literature does not provide information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

这些再生方法的有效性似乎有限，因为它们都不能完全恢复催化剂的初始活性。这表明某些形式的失活，特别是铬物种的聚集，可能是不可逆的，或需要更激烈的再生条件。

两种方法的温度要求相似，约为500°C。然而，除了观察到无法完全恢复活性外，文献并未详细说明这些方法对催化性能的具体影响。

文献没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加用于减缓VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜力的信息。因此，基于给定信息无法回答问题的这些方面。

Based on the limited information provided in the literature, the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation for Cr-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes appear to be:

1. Coke formation
2. Decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation

The literature discusses two regeneration methods:

1. Regeneration in CO2 at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours
2. Regeneration in air at 500°C

Neither method was fully effective in recovering the initial catalytic activity. The CO2 regeneration method was tried first, followed by air regeneration, but both failed to completely restore the catalyst's performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance for various regeneration methods beyond these two examples. Additionally, there is no mention of VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The study focuses primarily on Ru-modified Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, and does not provide comprehensive information on regeneration methods or comparisons between different catalyst types.

根据文献提供的有限信息，Cr基催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因似乎是：

1. 积碳形成
2. 由于聚集导致Cr物种分散度降低

文献讨论了两种再生方法：

1. 在496 ± 3°C下用CO2再生3小时
2. 在500°C下用空气再生

这两种方法都无法完全恢复初始催化活性。先尝试了CO2再生方法，然后是空气再生，但两种方法都未能完全恢复催化剂的性能。

除了这两个例子，文献并未提供关于各种再生方法的有效性、温度要求或对催化性能影响的具体信息。此外，也没有提到VOx催化剂或CO2添加对减少VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在影响。

这项研究主要集中在用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢的Ru改性Cr基催化剂上，并未提供关于再生方法或不同类型催化剂之间比较的全面信息。
