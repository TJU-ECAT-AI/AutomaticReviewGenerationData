[1] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream."

[2] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."

[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in Fig. S4. We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered."

[4] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.

2. Aggregation of active species: The decreased dispersion of Cr species due to sintering or agglomeration.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours. This method was not fully effective in recovering the catalyst's initial activity.

2. Air regeneration: Conducted at 500°C. This method also failed to fully restore the catalyst's initial activity and resulted in even lower activity than the CO2-regenerated cycle after reaction stabilization.

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods appears limited, as neither could fully recover the catalyst's initial activity. This suggests that some forms of deactivation, particularly the aggregation of Cr species, may be irreversible or require more aggressive regeneration conditions.

The temperature requirements for both methods were similar, around 500°C. However, the specific impact on catalytic performance was not detailed beyond the observation that full activity recovery was not achieved.

The literature does not provide information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 积碳形成：碳质沉积物在催化剂表面的累积。

2. 活性物种的聚集：由于烧结或团聚导致铬物种分散度降低。

关于再生方法：

1. CO2再生：在496 ± 3°C下进行3小时。这种方法不能完全恢复催化剂的初始活性。

2. 空气再生：在500°C下进行。这种方法也未能完全恢复催化剂的初始活性，并且在反应稳定后，其活性甚至低于CO2再生循环。

这些再生方法的有效性似乎有限，因为它们都不能完全恢复催化剂的初始活性。这表明某些形式的失活，特别是铬物种的聚集，可能是不可逆的，或需要更激烈的再生条件。

两种方法的温度要求相似，约为500°C。然而，除了观察到无法完全恢复活性外，文献并未详细说明这些方法对催化性能的具体影响。

文献没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加用于减缓VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜力的信息。因此，基于给定信息无法回答问题的这些方面。
