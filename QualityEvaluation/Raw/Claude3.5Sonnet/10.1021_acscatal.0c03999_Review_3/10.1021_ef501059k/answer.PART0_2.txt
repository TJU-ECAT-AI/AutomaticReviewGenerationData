<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, causes of deactivation for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, or regeneration methods. The document appears to be about hydraulic fracturing additives and hydrogen sulfide in shale gas, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

所提供的文献不包含任何与回答氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活、基于Cr和VOx催化剂的失活原因或再生方法相关的信息。该文档似乎是关于水力压裂添加剂和页岩气中的硫化氢，与问题主题无关。因此，无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
