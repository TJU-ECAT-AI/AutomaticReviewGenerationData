The literature does not directly address the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation or compare various regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The study focuses on the preparation and performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts using metal vapor synthesis (MVS) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2.

However, the paper does provide some insight into catalyst deactivation over time. It shows that the initial propane conversion for a 0.5 wt% Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst decreased from about 42% to 28% over 400 minutes, then remained stable for the next 400 minutes. This suggests some initial deactivation followed by stabilization, but the specific causes are not discussed.

The study used CO2 as an oxidant in the reaction feed (C3H8:CO2:N2 = 15:30:55), which may have helped mitigate overoxidation, but this is not explicitly stated or compared to other oxidants.

The paper does not discuss regeneration methods or their effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance. It also does not provide information on VOx catalysts or the specific effects of CO2 addition on mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，也没有比较Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的各种再生方法。这项研究主要集中在使用金属蒸气合成法(MVS)制备CrOx/SiO2催化剂，并研究其在CO2存在下的丙烷氧化脱氢性能。

然而，该文章确实提供了一些关于催化剂随时间失活的见解。它显示，0.5 wt% Cr/SiO2-MVS催化剂的初始丙烷转化率在400分钟内从约42%降至28%，然后在接下来的400分钟内保持稳定。这表明存在一些初始失活现象，随后趋于稳定，但未讨论具体原因。

研究使用CO2作为反应进料中的氧化剂（C3H8:CO2:N2 = 15:30:55），这可能有助于减缓过度氧化，但并未明确说明或与其他氧化剂进行比较。

该文章没有讨论再生方法及其有效性、温度要求或对催化性能的影响。它也没有提供关于VOx催化剂的信息，或CO2添加对减缓VOx催化反应中过度氧化的具体影响。
