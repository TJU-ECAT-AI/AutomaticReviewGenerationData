          "Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking [29]."

"The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

"Before the reaction all catalysts were activated in air flow at T = 600 C for at least 2 h. After the experiment catalysts were regenerated in air flow at T = 600 C for 6 h."

"The initial conversion of propane on the 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was ca. 42%, than in 400 min decreased till ca. 28% and then remained stable for the next 400 min"

"Conversely, catalysts based on Cr are among the more effective, and the optimisation of their behavior is still a target to be attained. In this respect, a basic point is represented by the achievement of a high dispersion of chromium, as isolated/oligomeric CrOx species are supposed to exhibit the highest catalytic activity."

"Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coking: Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to coke deposition and catalyst deactivation.

2. Loss of active sites: Over time, the highly dispersed active CrOx species may agglomerate or transform into less active forms, reducing catalytic activity.

3. Pore blockage: Coke formation and structural changes can lead to a decrease in pore volume and specific surface area, limiting access to active sites.

4. Gradual activity loss: The initial conversion of propane decreases over time, indicating a gradual deactivation process.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. The study mentions catalyst activation and regeneration in air flow at 600°C for 2 hours before the reaction and 6 hours after the experiment, respectively. This suggests that reoxidation with air at high temperatures is an effective method for catalyst regeneration.

2. The literature does not provide information on comparisons between different regeneration methods or the specific impacts of CO2 addition on VOx-catalyzed reactions.

3. The long-term test results show that catalyst activity initially decreases but then stabilizes, suggesting that some form of in-situ regeneration or stability mechanism may be at play during the reaction process.

The document does not provide sufficient information to fully answer all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx catalysts and the comparison of various regeneration methods.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 结焦：催化剂表面的布朗斯特酸位点可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转化，导致焦炭沉积和催化剂失活。

2. 活性位点损失：随着时间的推移，高度分散的活性CrOx物种可能会聚集或转化为活性较低的形式，降低催化活性。

3. 孔道堵塞：焦炭形成和结构变化可能导致孔体积和比表面积的降低，限制了对活性位点的接近。

4. 活性逐渐下降：丙烷的初始转化率随时间降低，表明存在逐渐的失活过程。

关于再生方法：

1. 研究提到在反应前在600°C下用空气流活化催化剂2小时，实验后在600°C下用空气流再生6小时。这表明高温下的空气氧化是一种有效的催化剂再生方法。

2. 文献没有提供不同再生方法之间的比较信息，也没有提供CO2添加对VOx催化反应的具体影响。

3. 长期测试结果表明，催化剂活性最初会下降，但随后会稳定，这表明在反应过程中可能存在某种原位再生或稳定机制。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来全面回答问题的所有方面，特别是关于VOx催化剂和各种再生方法的比较。
