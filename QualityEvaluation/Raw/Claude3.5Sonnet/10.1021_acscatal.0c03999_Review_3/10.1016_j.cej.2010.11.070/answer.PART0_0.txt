[1] "Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking [29]."

[2] "The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

[3] "Before the reaction all catalysts were activated in air flow at T = 600 C for at least 2 h. After the experiment catalysts were regenerated in air flow at T = 600 C for 6 h."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on all aspects of the question. However, based on the available quotes:

1. A primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is coking, which is promoted by Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface. These sites can lead to further transformation of initially produced olefins, resulting in catalyst deactivation.

2. The only regeneration method mentioned in the text is reoxidation with air flow at 600°C for 6 hours after the experiment. This suggests that air oxidation at high temperatures is an effective method for catalyst regeneration.

3. The literature does not provide information on comparisons between different regeneration methods or the specific impacts of CO2 addition on VOx-catalyzed reactions.

4. Catalyst activation before the reaction also involves air flow treatment at 600°C for at least 2 hours, indicating the importance of oxidative pretreatment for catalyst performance.

The document does not provide sufficient information to fully answer all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx catalysts and the comparison of various regeneration methods.

根据可用的引文，文献并未提供问题所有方面的全面信息。但是，我们可以得出以下结论：

1. 氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的一个主要原因是结焦，这是由催化剂表面的布朗斯特酸位点促进的。这些位点可能导致初始生成的烯烃进一步转化，从而导致催化剂失活。

2. 文中唯一提到的再生方法是在实验后在600°C下用空气流再氧化6小时。这表明高温下的空气氧化是一种有效的催化剂再生方法。

3. 文献没有提供不同再生方法之间的比较信息，也没有提供CO2添加对VOx催化反应的具体影响。

4. 反应前的催化剂活化也涉及在600°C下进行至少2小时的空气流处理，这表明氧化预处理对催化剂性能很重要。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来全面回答问题的所有方面，特别是关于VOx催化剂和各种再生方法的比较。
