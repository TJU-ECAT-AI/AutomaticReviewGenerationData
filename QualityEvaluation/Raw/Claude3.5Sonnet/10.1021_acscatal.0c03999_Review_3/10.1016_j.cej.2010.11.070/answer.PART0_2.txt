[1] "Actually, this process has been the subject of many investigations, and a number of catalysts have been evaluated [15]. However, catalysts based on Cr are among the more effective, and the optimisation of their behavior is still a target to be attained."

[2] "The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

[3] "Before the reaction all catalysts were activated in air flow at T = 600 C for at least 2 h. The reaction products were analysed by GC methods using two columns  molecular sieves 5A (H2, O2, N2, CH4, CO) and Porapak Q (CO2, hydrocarbons). After the experiment catalysts were regenerated in air flow at T = 600 C for 6 h."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or a comparison of various regeneration methods. However, some relevant points can be drawn:

1. Chromium-based catalysts are among the more effective for oxidative dehydrogenation, but their behavior still needs optimization.

2. Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to catalyst deactivation through coking.

3. The study mentions catalyst activation in air flow at 600°C before the reaction and regeneration in air flow at 600°C for 6 hours after the experiment. This suggests that oxidation with air at high temperatures is used for both activation and regeneration of the catalysts.

4. The literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of different regeneration methods or the impact of CO2 addition on VOx-catalyzed reactions.

To fully answer the question, more specific research on catalyst deactivation causes and regeneration methods would be needed.

该文献没有提供关于氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因或各种再生方法比较的全面信息。但是，可以得出一些相关要点：

1. 铬基催化剂是氧化脱氢反应中较为有效的催化剂之一，但它们的性能仍需优化。

2. 催化剂表面的布朗斯特酸位点可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转化，导致催化剂因结焦而失活。

3. 研究提到在反应前在600°C下用空气流活化催化剂，实验后在600°C下用空气流再生6小时。这表明高温下的空气氧化被用于催化剂的活化和再生。

4. 文献没有提供不同再生方法的有效性或CO2添加对VOx催化反应影响的信息。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对催化剂失活原因和再生方法进行更具体的研究。
