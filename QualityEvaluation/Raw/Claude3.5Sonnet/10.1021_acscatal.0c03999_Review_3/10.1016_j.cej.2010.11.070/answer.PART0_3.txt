[1] "Conversely, catalysts based on Cr are among the more effective, and the optimisation of their behavior is still a target to be attained. In this respect, a basic point is represented by the achievement of a high dispersion of chromium, as isolated/oligomeric CrOx species are supposed to exhibit the highest catalytic activity."

[2] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[3] "The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

[4] "The initial conversion of propane on the 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was ca. 42%, than in 400 min decreased till ca. 28% and then remained stable for the next 400 min"

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to coke deposition and catalyst deactivation.

2. Loss of active sites: Over time, the highly dispersed active CrOx species may agglomerate or transform into less active forms, reducing catalytic activity.

3. Pore blockage: Coke formation and structural changes can lead to a decrease in pore volume and specific surface area, limiting access to active sites.

4. Overoxidation: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this is a known issue in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on various regeneration methods or their comparative effectiveness. However, it does mention that catalysts were regenerated in air flow at 600°C for 6 hours after experiments, suggesting that reoxidation with air is one method used.

The text does not provide information on the effectiveness of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, it does mention the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which may have implications for reaction control and catalyst stability.

The long-term test results show that the catalyst activity initially decreases but then stabilizes, suggesting that some form of in-situ regeneration or stability mechanism may be at play during the reaction process.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 焦炭形成：催化剂表面的Brønsted酸位可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转化，导致焦炭沉积和催化剂失活。

2. 活性位点损失：随着时间的推移，高度分散的活性CrOx物种可能会聚集或转化为活性较低的形式，降低催化活性。

3. 孔道堵塞：焦炭形成和结构变化可能导致孔体积和比表面积的降低，限制了对活性位点的接近。

4. 过度氧化：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但这是氧化脱氢过程中的一个已知问题。

文献没有提供关于各种再生方法或其比较效果的具体信息。然而，它确实提到催化剂在实验后在600°C下用空气流再生6小时，表明用空气再氧化是一种使用的方法。

文本没有提供关于CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的有效性的信息。然而，它确实提到在丙烷的氧化脱氢中使用CO2作为温和的氧化剂，这可能对反应控制和催化剂稳定性有影响。

长期测试结果表明，催化剂活性最初会下降，但随后会稳定，这表明在反应过程中可能存在某种原位再生或稳定机制。
