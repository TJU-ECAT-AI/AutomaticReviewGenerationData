[1] "Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking [29]."

[2] "The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

[3] "Before the reaction all catalysts were activated in air flow at T = 600 C for at least 2 h. After the experiment catalysts were regenerated in air flow at T = 600 C for 6 h."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on all aspects of the question. However, based on the available quotes:

1. A primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is coking, which is promoted by Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface. These sites can lead to further transformation of initially produced olefins, resulting in catalyst deactivation.

2. The only regeneration method mentioned in the text is reoxidation with air flow at 600°C for 6 hours after the experiment. This suggests that air oxidation at high temperatures is an effective method for catalyst regeneration.

3. The literature does not provide information on comparisons between different regeneration methods or the specific impacts of CO2 addition on VOx-catalyzed reactions.

4. Catalyst activation before the reaction also involves air flow treatment at 600°C for at least 2 hours, indicating the importance of oxidative pretreatment for catalyst performance.

The document does not provide sufficient information to fully answer all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx catalysts and the comparison of various regeneration methods.

根据可用的引文，文献并未提供问题所有方面的全面信息。但是，我们可以得出以下结论：

1. 氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的一个主要原因是结焦，这是由催化剂表面的布朗斯特酸位点促进的。这些位点可能导致初始生成的烯烃进一步转化，从而导致催化剂失活。

2. 文中唯一提到的再生方法是在实验后在600°C下用空气流再氧化6小时。这表明高温下的空气氧化是一种有效的催化剂再生方法。

3. 文献没有提供不同再生方法之间的比较信息，也没有提供CO2添加对VOx催化反应的具体影响。

4. 反应前的催化剂活化也涉及在600°C下进行至少2小时的空气流处理，这表明氧化预处理对催化剂性能很重要。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来全面回答问题的所有方面，特别是关于VOx催化剂和各种再生方法的比较。

[1] "For the sake of comparison, the values for the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation method (hereafter: CrSiO2-WI) are also reported [5] (Table 1, Part B). It can be observed, that the two types of catalysts with the similar chromium loadings exhibit similar textural features."

[2] "Catalyst that contains only 0.5 wt% Cr already demonstrated propane conversion of ca.45% that is almost equal to the propane conversion that can be achieved on the catalyst with 5.0 wt% Cr but prepared by standard method of wet impregnation (47%) [5]."

[3] "The initial conversion of propane on the 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was ca. 42%, than in 400 min decreased till ca. 28% and then remained stable for the next 400 min (Fig. 5, Panel A). In the same reaction conditions the initial conversion of propane on the 5.0-Cr/SiO2-WI catalyst reached ca. 45% and than in 400 min reduced till ca. 30% and continue to decrease."

The literature does not directly address the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation or compare various regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The text focuses on comparing catalysts prepared by metal vapor synthesis (MVS) and wet impregnation (WI) methods, mainly in terms of their initial activity and stability over time.

The document shows that both types of catalysts experience some deactivation over time, as evidenced by the decrease in propane conversion. However, it does not discuss the specific causes of this deactivation or any regeneration methods. The MVS catalyst with lower Cr loading (0.5 wt%) shows slightly better stability compared to the WI catalyst with higher Cr loading (5.0 wt%), but the reasons for this are not explored in depth.

The paper does not mention the use of CO2, O2, or air for catalyst regeneration, nor does it discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The focus is primarily on the initial performance and short-term stability of the catalysts rather than on deactivation mechanisms or regeneration strategies.

文献没有直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，也没有比较Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的各种再生方法。文本主要集中在比较通过金属蒸气合成（MVS）和湿法浸渍（WI）方法制备的催化剂，主要是在初始活性和随时间的稳定性方面。

文件显示，这两类催化剂随时间的推移都会经历一些失活，这从丙烷转化率的下降可以看出。然而，它并没有讨论这种失活的具体原因或任何再生方法。低Cr负载（0.5 wt%）的MVS催化剂与高Cr负载（5.0 wt%）的WI催化剂相比，显示出略好的稳定性，但文中并未深入探讨其原因。

该论文没有提到使用CO2、O2或空气进行催化剂再生，也没有讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。文章主要关注催化剂的初始性能和短期稳定性，而不是失活机制或再生策略。

[1] "Actually, this process has been the subject of many investigations, and a number of catalysts have been evaluated [15]. However, catalysts based on Cr are among the more effective, and the optimisation of their behavior is still a target to be attained."

[2] "The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

[3] "Before the reaction all catalysts were activated in air flow at T = 600 C for at least 2 h. The reaction products were analysed by GC methods using two columns  molecular sieves 5A (H2, O2, N2, CH4, CO) and Porapak Q (CO2, hydrocarbons). After the experiment catalysts were regenerated in air flow at T = 600 C for 6 h."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or a comparison of various regeneration methods. However, some relevant points can be drawn:

1. Chromium-based catalysts are among the more effective for oxidative dehydrogenation, but their behavior still needs optimization.

2. Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to catalyst deactivation through coking.

3. The study mentions catalyst activation in air flow at 600°C before the reaction and regeneration in air flow at 600°C for 6 hours after the experiment. This suggests that oxidation with air at high temperatures is used for both activation and regeneration of the catalysts.

4. The literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of different regeneration methods or the impact of CO2 addition on VOx-catalyzed reactions.

To fully answer the question, more specific research on catalyst deactivation causes and regeneration methods would be needed.

该文献没有提供关于氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因或各种再生方法比较的全面信息。但是，可以得出一些相关要点：

1. 铬基催化剂是氧化脱氢反应中较为有效的催化剂之一，但它们的性能仍需优化。

2. 催化剂表面的布朗斯特酸位点可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转化，导致催化剂因结焦而失活。

3. 研究提到在反应前在600°C下用空气流活化催化剂，实验后在600°C下用空气流再生6小时。这表明高温下的空气氧化被用于催化剂的活化和再生。

4. 文献没有提供不同再生方法的有效性或CO2添加对VOx催化反应影响的信息。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对催化剂失活原因和再生方法进行更具体的研究。

[1] "Conversely, catalysts based on Cr are among the more effective, and the optimisation of their behavior is still a target to be attained. In this respect, a basic point is represented by the achievement of a high dispersion of chromium, as isolated/oligomeric CrOx species are supposed to exhibit the highest catalytic activity."

[2] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[3] "The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to coke deposition and catalyst deactivation.

2. Loss of active sites: Over time, the highly dispersed active CrOx species may agglomerate or transform into less active forms, reducing catalytic activity.

3. Pore blockage: Coke formation and structural changes can lead to a decrease in pore volume and specific surface area, limiting access to active sites.

4. Overoxidation: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this is a known issue in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide specific information on various regeneration methods or their comparative effectiveness. However, it does mention that catalysts were regenerated in air flow at 600°C for 6 hours after experiments, suggesting that reoxidation with air is one method used.

The text does not provide information on the effectiveness of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, it does mention the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which may have implications for reaction control and catalyst stability.

The long-term test results show that the catalyst activity initially decreases but then stabilizes, suggesting that some form of in-situ regeneration or stability mechanism may be at play during the reaction process.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 焦炭形成：催化剂表面的Brønsted酸位可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转化，导致焦炭沉积和催化剂失活。

2. 活性位点损失：随着时间的推移，高度分散的活性CrOx物种可能会聚集或转化为活性较低的形式，降低催化活性。

3. 孔道堵塞：焦炭形成和结构变化可能导致孔体积和比表面积的降低，限制了对活性位点的接近。

4. 过度氧化：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但这是氧化脱氢过程中的一个已知问题。

文献没有提供关于各种再生方法或其比较效果的具体信息。然而，它确实提到催化剂在实验后在600°C下用空气流再生6小时，表明用空气再氧化是一种使用的方法。

文本没有提供关于CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的有效性的信息。然而，它确实提到在丙烷的氧化脱氢中使用CO2作为温和的氧化剂，这可能对反应控制和催化剂稳定性有影响。

长期测试结果表明，催化剂活性最初会下降，但随后会稳定，这表明在反应过程中可能存在某种原位再生或稳定机制。

The literature does not directly address the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation or compare various regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The study focuses on the preparation and performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts using metal vapor synthesis (MVS) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2.

However, the paper does provide some insight into catalyst deactivation over time. It shows that the initial propane conversion for a 0.5 wt% Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst decreased from about 42% to 28% over 400 minutes, then remained stable for the next 400 minutes. This suggests some initial deactivation followed by stabilization, but the specific causes are not discussed.

The study used CO2 as an oxidant in the reaction feed (C3H8:CO2:N2 = 15:30:55), which may have helped mitigate overoxidation, but this is not explicitly stated or compared to other oxidants.

The paper does not discuss regeneration methods or their effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance. It also does not provide information on VOx catalysts or the specific effects of CO2 addition on mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

然而，该文章确实提供了一些关于催化剂随时间失活的见解。它显示，0.5 wt% Cr/SiO2-MVS催化剂的初始丙烷转化率在400分钟内从约42%降至28%，然后在接下来的400分钟内保持稳定。这表明存在一些初始失活现象，随后趋于稳定，但未讨论具体原因。

研究使用CO2作为反应进料中的氧化剂（C3H8:CO2:N2 = 15:30:55），这可能有助于减缓过度氧化，但并未明确说明或与其他氧化剂进行比较。

该文章没有讨论再生方法及其有效性、温度要求或对催化性能的影响。它也没有提供关于VOx催化剂的信息，或CO2添加对减缓VOx催化反应中过度氧化的具体影响。
