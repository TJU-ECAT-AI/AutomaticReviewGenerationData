[1] "For the sake of comparison, the values for the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation method (hereafter: CrSiO2-WI) are also reported [5] (Table 1, Part B). It can be observed, that the two types of catalysts with the similar chromium loadings exhibit similar textural features."

[2] "Catalyst that contains only 0.5 wt% Cr already demonstrated propane conversion of ca.45% that is almost equal to the propane conversion that can be achieved on the catalyst with 5.0 wt% Cr but prepared by standard method of wet impregnation (47%) [5]."

[3] "The initial conversion of propane on the 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was ca. 42%, than in 400 min decreased till ca. 28% and then remained stable for the next 400 min (Fig. 5, Panel A). In the same reaction conditions the initial conversion of propane on the 5.0-Cr/SiO2-WI catalyst reached ca. 45% and than in 400 min reduced till ca. 30% and continue to decrease."

The literature does not directly address the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation or compare various regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The text focuses on comparing catalysts prepared by metal vapor synthesis (MVS) and wet impregnation (WI) methods, mainly in terms of their initial activity and stability over time.

The document shows that both types of catalysts experience some deactivation over time, as evidenced by the decrease in propane conversion. However, it does not discuss the specific causes of this deactivation or any regeneration methods. The MVS catalyst with lower Cr loading (0.5 wt%) shows slightly better stability compared to the WI catalyst with higher Cr loading (5.0 wt%), but the reasons for this are not explored in depth.

The paper does not mention the use of CO2, O2, or air for catalyst regeneration, nor does it discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The focus is primarily on the initial performance and short-term stability of the catalysts rather than on deactivation mechanisms or regeneration strategies.

文献没有直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，也没有比较Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的各种再生方法。文本主要集中在比较通过金属蒸气合成（MVS）和湿法浸渍（WI）方法制备的催化剂，主要是在初始活性和随时间的稳定性方面。

文件显示，这两类催化剂随时间的推移都会经历一些失活，这从丙烷转化率的下降可以看出。然而，它并没有讨论这种失活的具体原因或任何再生方法。低Cr负载（0.5 wt%）的MVS催化剂与高Cr负载（5.0 wt%）的WI催化剂相比，显示出略好的稳定性，但文中并未深入探讨其原因。

该论文没有提到使用CO2、O2或空气进行催化剂再生，也没有讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。文章主要关注催化剂的初始性能和短期稳定性，而不是失活机制或再生策略。
