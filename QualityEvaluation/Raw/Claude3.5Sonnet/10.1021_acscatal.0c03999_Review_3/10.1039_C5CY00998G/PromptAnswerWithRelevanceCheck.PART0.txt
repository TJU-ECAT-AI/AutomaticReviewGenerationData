[1] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[2] "The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."

[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: This is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, particularly affecting porous structures that can be more easily blocked by coke.

2. Changes in metal oxidation state: The oxidation state of chromium species can change during the reaction, affecting catalyst performance.

3. Textural changes: Different textural features of the catalysts can influence their susceptibility to deactivation.

4. Brnsted acid sites: The presence and amount of these sites, which increase with Cr content, can affect catalyst activity and deactivation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This is effective in restoring the higher oxidation state of Cr (Cr3+), which may be beneficial for some reactions but could lead to overoxidation.

2. CO2 as an oxidant: Using CO2 maintains Cr in a lower oxidation state (Cr2+), which appears to be favorable for propene selectivity in ODH reactions.

3. Temperature requirements: The study mentions catalyst regeneration at 873 K (600°C) in air flow for at least 6 hours.

4. Impact on catalytic performance: Proper regeneration can restore catalyst activity without causing irreversible deactivation, allowing for multiple reaction runs with consistent performance.

The addition of CO2 in VOx-catalyzed reactions was not specifically addressed in this study, which focused on Cr-based catalysts. However, the use of CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 showed promising results in maintaining catalyst activity and influencing product selectivity for Cr-based catalysts.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 积碳形成：这是催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对多孔结构的影响更大，因为它们更容易被积碳堵塞。

2. 金属氧化态的变化：铬物种的氧化态在反应过程中可能发生变化，影响催化剂性能。

3. 结构变化：催化剂的不同结构特征可能影响其失活的敏感性。

4. Brnsted酸位点：这些位点的存在和数量会随Cr含量的增加而增加，可能影响催化剂活性和失活。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：这种方法有效地恢复了Cr的高氧化态（Cr3+），对某些反应可能有益，但可能导致过度氧化。

2. 使用CO2作为氧化剂：使用CO2可以将Cr保持在较低的氧化态（Cr2+），这似乎有利于ODH反应中的丙烯选择性。

3. 温度要求：研究提到在873 K（600°C）的空气流中进行至少6小时的催化剂再生。

4. 对催化性能的影响：适当的再生可以恢复催化剂活性而不造成不可逆失活，允许多次反应运行并保持一致的性能。

这项研究没有具体讨论CO2在VOx催化反应中的添加，主要集中在基于Cr的催化剂。然而，使用CO2作为氧化剂或与O2组合使用，在保持催化剂活性和影响产物选择性方面对Cr基催化剂显示了有希望的结果。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke formation: This is the main cause of reversible deactivation, affecting catalyst activity differently depending on textural features and the amount of Brnsted acid sites.

2. Changes in the oxidation state of chromium species: This is a reversible process that can affect catalyst performance.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air: This method was effective in removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The temperature used was 873 K for at least 6 hours.

2. CO2 as an oxidant: Using CO2 in the reaction mixture reduced coke formation compared to direct dehydrogenation, but not as effectively as O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures.

3. O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures: These were most effective in reducing coke formation during the reaction.

The impact on catalytic performance:

1. All regeneration methods were effective in preventing irreversible deactivation, allowing the catalysts to maintain their performance over multiple runs.

2. The oxidation state of chromium was affected by the oxidant used: CO2 resulted in Cr2+ species, while O2 (alone or with CO2) resulted in Cr3+ species, which may contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of olefins.

The document does not provide specific information about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 积碳形成：这是可逆失活的主要原因，根据催化剂的结构特征和Brnsted酸位的数量，对催化剂活性的影响程度不同。

2. 铬物种氧化态的变化：这是一个可逆过程，可能影响催化剂性能。

关于再生方法：

1. 空气再氧化：这种方法在去除积碳和恢复催化剂活性方面很有效。使用的温度为873 K，至少6小时。

2. 使用CO2作为氧化剂：与直接脱氢相比，在反应混合物中使用CO2可以减少积碳形成，但效果不如O2或O2+CO2混合物。

3. O2或O2+CO2混合物：这些在减少反应过程中积碳形成方面最为有效。

对催化性能的影响：

1. 所有再生方法都能有效防止不可逆失活，使催化剂在多次运行中保持其性能。

2. 所使用的氧化剂影响铬的氧化态：CO2导致形成Cr2+物种，而O2（单独或与CO2混合）导致形成Cr3+物种，这可能导致烯烃选择性和产率的差异。

文献中没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加在减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化方面潜力的具体信息。

[1] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards possible irreversible deactivation in the ODH of propane, in reaction conditions as close as possible to industrial applications"

[3] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes appears to be coke formation, as evidenced by the TGA data showing weight loss due to coke removal. The literature does not directly compare various regeneration methods, but it does mention that catalyst reactivation in oxygen can reverse the aggregation of Cr species that occurs during propane ODH with O2 as oxidant.

The effectiveness of regeneration methods seems to depend on the oxidant used during the reaction. When CO2 was used as an oxidant, less coke was formed compared to direct dehydrogenation, and even less coke was formed when O2 or O2+CO2 mixture was used. This suggests that the presence of oxidants, especially O2, helps mitigate coke formation and potentially eases regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or the impact on catalytic performance after regeneration. However, it does mention that the catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after long periods of testing, and maintained high yields of propene.

Regarding CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, the literature does not provide direct information. However, it does show that using CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 can lead to high propene yields and reduce coke formation, which could potentially be applicable to VOx catalysts as well.

在氧化脱氢过程中,金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因似乎是积碳形成,这一点从TGA数据中显示的积碳去除导致的重量损失可以看出。文献没有直接比较各种再生方法,但确实提到在氧气中进行催化剂再活化可以逆转在使用O2作为氧化剂的丙烷ODH过程中发生的Cr物种聚集。

再生方法的有效性似乎取决于反应中使用的氧化剂。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时,与直接脱氢相比,形成的积碳较少,而当使用O2或O2+CO2混合物时,形成的积碳更少。这表明氧化剂的存在,特别是O2,有助于减少积碳形成,并可能简化再生过程。

文献没有提供关于再生温度要求或再生后对催化性能影响的具体信息。然而,它确实提到即使在长时间测试后,催化剂对不可逆失活表现出稳定性,并保持了高的丙烯产率。

关于CO2添加对缓解VOx催化反应中过度氧化的影响,文献没有提供直接信息。然而,它确实显示使用CO2作为氧化剂或与O2组合使用可以导致高丙烯产率并减少积碳形成,这可能也适用于VOx催化剂。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: This is a major cause of reversible deactivation, especially affecting porous structures which can be more easily blocked.

2. Changes in metal oxidation state: For Cr catalysts, the oxidation state changes depending on the oxidant used (CO2 vs O2), which can affect catalyst performance.

3. Aggregation of metal species: This can occur during reactions, particularly when O2 is used as an oxidant.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This appears to be effective in reversing aggregation of Cr species and restoring catalyst activity. It is typically performed at high temperatures (e.g. 873 K).

2. Using CO2 as an oxidant: This keeps Cr in a lower oxidation state (+2) compared to O2 (+3), which may contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of products.

3. Adding CO2 to O2: This combination appears to improve catalyst stability and propane conversion compared to using O2 alone, possibly by mitigating overoxidation.

The effectiveness of these methods varies, with O2-based regeneration seeming most effective at reversing deactivation. However, using CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and potentially improving selectivity. Temperature requirements are generally high (e.g. 873 K) for all regeneration methods mentioned.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，重点关注Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳形成：这是可逆失活的主要原因，特别影响多孔结构，因为多孔结构更容易被积碳堵塞。

2. 金属氧化态的变化：对于Cr催化剂，氧化态随所使用的氧化剂（CO2与O2）而变化，这可能影响催化剂性能。

3. 金属物种的聚集：这可能在反应过程中发生，特别是当使用O2作为氧化剂时。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：这似乎能有效逆转Cr物种的聚集并恢复催化剂活性。通常在高温下进行（如873 K）。

2. 使用CO2作为氧化剂：与O2（+3）相比，这使Cr保持在较低的氧化态（+2），可能导致产品选择性和产率的差异。

3. 将CO2添加到O2中：与单独使用O2相比，这种组合似乎能提高催化剂稳定性和丙烷转化率，可能是通过减缓过度氧化。

这些方法的有效性各不相同，基于O2的再生似乎最有效地逆转失活。然而，使用CO2作为氧化剂或与O2组合显示出在保持催化剂性能和潜在提高选择性方面的前景。所有提到的再生方法通常都需要高温（如873 K）。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or a detailed comparison of various regeneration methods. However, it does offer some insights into catalyst stability and the effects of different oxidants:

1. The Cr-based catalysts studied showed remarkable stability against irreversible deactivation, maintaining high propene yields even after 900 minutes of testing.

2. Coke formation was identified as a cause of (reversible) deactivation. The amount of coke formed varied depending on the oxidant used:
   - Highest in direct dehydrogenation (3 wt%)
   - Lower with CO2 as oxidant (2 wt%)
   - Lowest with O2 or O2+CO2 mixture (1-0.5 wt%)

3. The oxidation state of chromium species was influenced by the oxidant used:
   - In direct dehydrogenation or ODH with CO2, chromium was primarily in the +2 oxidation state
   - When O2 was used (alone or with CO2), the average oxidation state was +3

4. The use of CO2 as an oxidant resulted in high propene yields (up to 40%) and maintained catalyst stability.

5. The combination of CO2 and O2 as oxidants showed promising results in terms of propane conversion and catalyst stability.

While the document doesn't directly address regeneration methods, it suggests that the choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in mitigating catalyst deactivation and maintaining performance in Cr-based ODH catalysts.
