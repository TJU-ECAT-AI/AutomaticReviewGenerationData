          "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

"The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."

"TGA data (Fig. 7) indicated that the weight loss assignable to coke removal by heating in air decreased from ca. 3 wt% for the catalyst tested in direct hydrogenation (curve a) to ca. 2 wt% when it was used for ODH in the presence of CO2 (curve b), and to ca. 1-0.5 wt% when the oxidant for ODH was O2 or the O2+CO2 mixture (curves c,d, respectively)."

"Thereby, the in situ XANES measurements provided evidence that during direct dehydrogenation or ODH in the presence of CO2 the active chromium species are in average in the +2 oxidation state, whereas when O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

"The aggregation of Cr species under reaction condition was proposed to occur in propane ODH with O2 as oxidant, then reversed by subsequent catalyst reactivation in oxygen."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: This is the main cause of reversible deactivation, affecting catalyst activity differently depending on textural features and the amount of Brønsted acid sites. The extent of coke formation varies with the oxidant used, being highest in direct dehydrogenation and lowest with O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures.

2. Changes in the oxidation state of chromium species: This is a reversible process that can affect catalyst performance. The oxidation state depends on the oxidant used, with CO2 resulting in Cr2+ species and O2 (alone or with CO2) resulting in Cr3+ species.

3. Aggregation of metal species: This can occur during reactions, particularly when O2 is used as an oxidant.

4. Textural changes: Different textural features of the catalysts can influence their susceptibility to deactivation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This method is effective in removing coke, reversing Cr species aggregation, and restoring catalyst activity. The temperature typically used is around 873 K for at least 6 hours.

2. Using CO2 as an oxidant: This approach reduces coke formation compared to direct dehydrogenation and maintains Cr in a lower oxidation state (Cr2+).

3. O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures: These are most effective in reducing coke formation during the reaction and maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state (Cr3+).

The effectiveness of these methods varies, with O2-based regeneration seeming most effective at reversing deactivation. However, using CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and potentially improving selectivity. All regeneration methods were effective in preventing irreversible deactivation, allowing the catalysts to maintain their performance over multiple runs.

The study does not provide specific information about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 积碳形成：这是可逆失活的主要原因，根据催化剂的结构特征和Brønsted酸位的数量，对催化剂活性的影响程度不同。积碳形成的程度随所用氧化剂的不同而变化，在直接脱氢中最高，在使用O2或O2+CO2混合物时最低。

2. 铬物种氧化态的变化：这是一个可逆过程，可能影响催化剂性能。氧化态取决于所使用的氧化剂，CO2导致形成Cr2+物种，而O2（单独或与CO2混合）导致形成Cr3+物种。

3. 金属物种的聚集：这可能在反应过程中发生，特别是当使用O2作为氧化剂时。

4. 结构变化：催化剂的不同结构特征可能影响其失活的敏感性。

关于再生方法：

1. 空气或O2再氧化：这种方法在去除积碳、逆转Cr物种聚集和恢复催化剂活性方面很有效。通常使用的温度约为873 K，至少6小时。

2. 使用CO2作为氧化剂：与直接脱氢相比，这种方法可以减少积碳形成，并将Cr保持在较低的氧化态（Cr2+）。

3. O2或O2+CO2混合物：这些在减少反应过程中积碳形成方面最为有效，并将Cr保持在较高的氧化态（Cr3+）。

这些方法的有效性各不相同，基于O2的再生似乎最有效地逆转失活。然而，使用CO2作为氧化剂或与O2组合显示出在保持催化剂性能和潜在提高选择性方面的前景。所有再生方法都能有效防止不可逆失活，使催化剂在多次运行中保持其性能。

研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加在减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化方面潜力的具体信息。
