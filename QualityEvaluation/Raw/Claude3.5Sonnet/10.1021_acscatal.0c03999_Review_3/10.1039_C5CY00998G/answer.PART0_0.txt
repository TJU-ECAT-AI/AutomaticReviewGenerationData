[1] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[2] "The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."

[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."

[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: This is a major cause of catalyst deactivation, particularly affecting porous structures that can be more easily blocked by coke.

2. Changes in metal oxidation state: The oxidation state of chromium species can change during the reaction, affecting catalyst performance.

3. Textural changes: Different textural features of the catalysts can influence their susceptibility to deactivation.

4. Brnsted acid sites: The presence and amount of these sites, which increase with Cr content, can affect catalyst activity and deactivation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This is effective in restoring the higher oxidation state of Cr (Cr3+), which may be beneficial for some reactions but could lead to overoxidation.

2. CO2 as an oxidant: Using CO2 maintains Cr in a lower oxidation state (Cr2+), which appears to be favorable for propene selectivity in ODH reactions.

3. Temperature requirements: The study mentions catalyst regeneration at 873 K (600°C) in air flow for at least 6 hours.

4. Impact on catalytic performance: Proper regeneration can restore catalyst activity without causing irreversible deactivation, allowing for multiple reaction runs with consistent performance.

The addition of CO2 in VOx-catalyzed reactions was not specifically addressed in this study, which focused on Cr-based catalysts. However, the use of CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 showed promising results in maintaining catalyst activity and influencing product selectivity for Cr-based catalysts.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 积碳形成：这是催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对多孔结构的影响更大，因为它们更容易被积碳堵塞。

2. 金属氧化态的变化：铬物种的氧化态在反应过程中可能发生变化，影响催化剂性能。

3. 结构变化：催化剂的不同结构特征可能影响其失活的敏感性。

4. Brnsted酸位点：这些位点的存在和数量会随Cr含量的增加而增加，可能影响催化剂活性和失活。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：这种方法有效地恢复了Cr的高氧化态（Cr3+），对某些反应可能有益，但可能导致过度氧化。

2. 使用CO2作为氧化剂：使用CO2可以将Cr保持在较低的氧化态（Cr2+），这似乎有利于ODH反应中的丙烯选择性。

3. 温度要求：研究提到在873 K（600°C）的空气流中进行至少6小时的催化剂再生。

4. 对催化性能的影响：适当的再生可以恢复催化剂活性而不造成不可逆失活，允许多次反应运行并保持一致的性能。

这项研究没有具体讨论CO2在VOx催化反应中的添加，主要集中在基于Cr的催化剂。然而，使用CO2作为氧化剂或与O2组合使用，在保持催化剂活性和影响产物选择性方面对Cr基催化剂显示了有希望的结果。
