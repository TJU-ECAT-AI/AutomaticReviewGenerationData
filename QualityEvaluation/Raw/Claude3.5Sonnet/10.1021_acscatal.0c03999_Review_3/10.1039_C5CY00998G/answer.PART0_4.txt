[1] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[2] "To clear up the role of oxidants, the 2.0-Cr/DHS catalyst, which exhibited the best propane ODH performances in the presence of CO2, was tested also using O2 and CO2+O2mixture as oxidant, as well as in direct dehydrogenation conditions"

[3] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."

[4] "TGA data (Fig. 7) indicated that the weight loss assignable to coke removal by heating in air decreased from ca. 3 wt% for the catalyst tested in direct hydrogenation (curve a) to ca. 2 wt% when it was used for ODH in the presence of CO2 (curve b), and to ca. 1-0.5 wt% when the oxidant for ODH was O2 or the O2+CO2 mixture (curves c,d, respectively)."

[5] "Thereby, the in situ XANES measurements provided evidence that during direct dehydrogenation or ODH in the presence of CO2 the active chromium species are in average in the +2 oxidation state, whereas when O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or a detailed comparison of various regeneration methods. However, it does offer some insights into catalyst stability and the effects of different oxidants:

1. The Cr-based catalysts studied showed remarkable stability against irreversible deactivation, maintaining high propene yields even after 900 minutes of testing.

2. Coke formation was identified as a cause of (reversible) deactivation. The amount of coke formed varied depending on the oxidant used:
   - Highest in direct dehydrogenation (3 wt%)
   - Lower with CO2 as oxidant (2 wt%)
   - Lowest with O2 or O2+CO2 mixture (1-0.5 wt%)

3. The oxidation state of chromium species was influenced by the oxidant used:
   - In direct dehydrogenation or ODH with CO2, chromium was primarily in the +2 oxidation state
   - When O2 was used (alone or with CO2), the average oxidation state was +3

4. The use of CO2 as an oxidant resulted in high propene yields (up to 40%) and maintained catalyst stability.

5. The combination of CO2 and O2 as oxidants showed promising results in terms of propane conversion and catalyst stability.

While the document doesn't directly address regeneration methods, it suggests that the choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in mitigating catalyst deactivation and maintaining performance in Cr-based ODH catalysts.

这篇文献没有提供关于氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因或各种再生方法的详细比较。但是,它确实提供了一些关于催化剂稳定性和不同氧化剂效果的见解:

1. 研究的铬基催化剂表现出良好的抗不可逆失活稳定性,即使在测试900分钟后仍能保持高丙烯产率。

2. 焦炭形成被确定为(可逆)失活的一个原因。形成的焦炭量随所用氧化剂的不同而变化:
   - 直接脱氢时最高(3 wt%)
   - 使用CO2作为氧化剂时较低(2 wt%)
   - 使用O2或O2+CO2混合物时最低(1-0.5 wt%)

3. 铬物种的氧化态受所用氧化剂的影响:
   - 在直接脱氢或使用CO2进行ODH时,铬主要处于+2氧化态
   - 当使用O2(单独或与CO2混合)时,平均氧化态为+3

4. 使用CO2作为氧化剂可获得高丙烯产率(高达40%),并保持催化剂稳定性。

5. CO2和O2作为氧化剂的组合在丙烷转化和催化剂稳定性方面显示出有前景的结果。

虽然该文档没有直接讨论再生方法,但它表明氧化剂的选择在缓解催化剂失活和维持铬基ODH催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。
