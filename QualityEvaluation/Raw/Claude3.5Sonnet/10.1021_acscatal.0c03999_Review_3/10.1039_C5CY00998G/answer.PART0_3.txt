[1] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."

[2] "The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."

[3] "Thereby, the in situ XANES measurements provided evidence that during direct dehydrogenation or ODH in the presence of CO2 the active chromium species are in average in the +2 oxidation state, whereas when O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

[4] "The aggregation of Cr species under reaction condition was proposed to occur in propane ODH with O2 as oxidant, then reversed by subsequent catalyst reactivation in oxygen."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: This is a major cause of reversible deactivation, especially affecting porous structures which can be more easily blocked.

2. Changes in metal oxidation state: For Cr catalysts, the oxidation state changes depending on the oxidant used (CO2 vs O2), which can affect catalyst performance.

3. Aggregation of metal species: This can occur during reactions, particularly when O2 is used as an oxidant.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This appears to be effective in reversing aggregation of Cr species and restoring catalyst activity. It is typically performed at high temperatures (e.g. 873 K).

2. Using CO2 as an oxidant: This keeps Cr in a lower oxidation state (+2) compared to O2 (+3), which may contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of products.

3. Adding CO2 to O2: This combination appears to improve catalyst stability and propane conversion compared to using O2 alone, possibly by mitigating overoxidation.

The effectiveness of these methods varies, with O2-based regeneration seeming most effective at reversing deactivation. However, using CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and potentially improving selectivity. Temperature requirements are generally high (e.g. 873 K) for all regeneration methods mentioned.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，重点关注Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳形成：这是可逆失活的主要原因，特别影响多孔结构，因为多孔结构更容易被积碳堵塞。

2. 金属氧化态的变化：对于Cr催化剂，氧化态随所使用的氧化剂（CO2与O2）而变化，这可能影响催化剂性能。

3. 金属物种的聚集：这可能在反应过程中发生，特别是当使用O2作为氧化剂时。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：这似乎能有效逆转Cr物种的聚集并恢复催化剂活性。通常在高温下进行（如873 K）。

2. 使用CO2作为氧化剂：与O2（+3）相比，这使Cr保持在较低的氧化态（+2），可能导致产品选择性和产率的差异。

3. 将CO2添加到O2中：与单独使用O2相比，这种组合似乎能提高催化剂稳定性和丙烷转化率，可能是通过减缓过度氧化。

这些方法的有效性各不相同，基于O2的再生似乎最有效地逆转失活。然而，使用CO2作为氧化剂或与O2组合显示出在保持催化剂性能和潜在提高选择性方面的前景。所有提到的再生方法通常都需要高温（如873 K）。
