[1] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards possible irreversible deactivation in the ODH of propane, in reaction conditions as close as possible to industrial applications"

[3] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."

[4] "TGA data (Fig. 7) indicated that the weight loss assignable to coke removal by heating in air decreased from ca. 3 wt% for the catalyst tested in direct hydrogenation (curve a) to ca. 2 wt% when it was used for ODH in the presence of CO2 (curve b), and to ca. 1-0.5 wt% when the oxidant for ODH was O2 or the O2+CO2 mixture (curves c,d, respectively)."

[5] "The aggregation of Cr species under reaction condition was proposed to occur in propane ODH with O2 as oxidant,16 then reversed by subsequent catalyst reactivation in oxygen."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes appears to be coke formation, as evidenced by the TGA data showing weight loss due to coke removal. The literature does not directly compare various regeneration methods, but it does mention that catalyst reactivation in oxygen can reverse the aggregation of Cr species that occurs during propane ODH with O2 as oxidant.

The effectiveness of regeneration methods seems to depend on the oxidant used during the reaction. When CO2 was used as an oxidant, less coke was formed compared to direct dehydrogenation, and even less coke was formed when O2 or O2+CO2 mixture was used. This suggests that the presence of oxidants, especially O2, helps mitigate coke formation and potentially eases regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or the impact on catalytic performance after regeneration. However, it does mention that the catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after long periods of testing, and maintained high yields of propene.

Regarding CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, the literature does not provide direct information. However, it does show that using CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 can lead to high propene yields and reduce coke formation, which could potentially be applicable to VOx catalysts as well.

在氧化脱氢过程中,金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因似乎是积碳形成,这一点从TGA数据中显示的积碳去除导致的重量损失可以看出。文献没有直接比较各种再生方法,但确实提到在氧气中进行催化剂再活化可以逆转在使用O2作为氧化剂的丙烷ODH过程中发生的Cr物种聚集。

再生方法的有效性似乎取决于反应中使用的氧化剂。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时,与直接脱氢相比,形成的积碳较少,而当使用O2或O2+CO2混合物时,形成的积碳更少。这表明氧化剂的存在,特别是O2,有助于减少积碳形成,并可能简化再生过程。

文献没有提供关于再生温度要求或再生后对催化性能影响的具体信息。然而,它确实提到即使在长时间测试后,催化剂对不可逆失活表现出稳定性,并保持了高的丙烯产率。

关于CO2添加对缓解VOx催化反应中过度氧化的影响,文献没有提供直接信息。然而,它确实显示使用CO2作为氧化剂或与O2组合使用可以导致高丙烯产率并减少积碳形成,这可能也适用于VOx催化剂。
