[1] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

[2] "The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."

[3] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."

[4] "TGA data (Fig. 7) indicated that the weight loss assignable to coke removal by heating in air decreased from ca. 3 wt% for the catalyst tested in direct hydrogenation (curve a) to ca. 2 wt% when it was used for ODH in the presence of CO2 (curve b), and to ca. 1-0.5 wt% when the oxidant for ODH was O2 or the O2+CO2 mixture (curves c,d, respectively)."

[5] "Thereby, the in situ XANES measurements provided evidence that during direct dehydrogenation or ODH in the presence of CO2 the active chromium species are in average in the +2 oxidation state, whereas when O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke formation: This is the main cause of reversible deactivation, affecting catalyst activity differently depending on textural features and the amount of Brnsted acid sites.

2. Changes in the oxidation state of chromium species: This is a reversible process that can affect catalyst performance.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air: This method was effective in removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The temperature used was 873 K for at least 6 hours.

2. CO2 as an oxidant: Using CO2 in the reaction mixture reduced coke formation compared to direct dehydrogenation, but not as effectively as O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures.

3. O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures: These were most effective in reducing coke formation during the reaction.

The impact on catalytic performance:

1. All regeneration methods were effective in preventing irreversible deactivation, allowing the catalysts to maintain their performance over multiple runs.

2. The oxidation state of chromium was affected by the oxidant used: CO2 resulted in Cr2+ species, while O2 (alone or with CO2) resulted in Cr3+ species, which may contribute to differences in selectivity and yield of olefins.

The document does not provide specific information about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 积碳形成：这是可逆失活的主要原因，根据催化剂的结构特征和Brnsted酸位的数量，对催化剂活性的影响程度不同。

2. 铬物种氧化态的变化：这是一个可逆过程，可能影响催化剂性能。

关于再生方法：

1. 空气再氧化：这种方法在去除积碳和恢复催化剂活性方面很有效。使用的温度为873 K，至少6小时。

2. 使用CO2作为氧化剂：与直接脱氢相比，在反应混合物中使用CO2可以减少积碳形成，但效果不如O2或O2+CO2混合物。

3. O2或O2+CO2混合物：这些在减少反应过程中积碳形成方面最为有效。

对催化性能的影响：

1. 所有再生方法都能有效防止不可逆失活，使催化剂在多次运行中保持其性能。

2. 所使用的氧化剂影响铬的氧化态：CO2导致形成Cr2+物种，而O2（单独或与CO2混合）导致形成Cr3+物种，这可能导致烯烃选择性和产率的差异。

文献中没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加在减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化方面潜力的具体信息。
