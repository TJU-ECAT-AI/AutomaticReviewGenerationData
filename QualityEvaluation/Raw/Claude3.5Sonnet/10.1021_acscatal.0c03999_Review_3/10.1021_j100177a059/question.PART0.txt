I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

cluded. In 
view of the presence of intense IR absorption bands 
of OH groups, it is obvious that the amount of strongly chemi- 
sorbed water cannot be significant. If strong interactions were 
to occur between the OH groups and the water molecules, the 
resolution of the corresponding vibrations would be reduced and 
they would shift toward lower wavenumbers.13 
The )'P MAS NMR spectrum of n-DPA-VPI-5 (not shown) 
contains three signals with chemical shifts of -23.3, -27.2, and 
-33.1 ppm in the intensity ratio 1:l:l. The 27Al MAS NMR 
spectrum (see Figure 6) shows the presence of 4-coordinated A104 
and 6-coordinated A106 environments at 41.6 and ca. -1 5 ppm, 
respectively. The similarity of the 31P and 27AI 
MAS spectra of 
n-DPA-VPI-5 and TBA-VPI-5 suggests that the deficiency of 
phosphorus atoms on 
the three kinds of crystallographically in- 
equivalent P sites in n-DPA-VPI-5 is random and that the dis- 
tortion of AI environments due to this deficiency is not reflected 
in the 27AI 
MAS NMR spectrum. 
After calcination of n-DPA-VPI-5 at 200 "C for 6 h and 
followed by rehydration of the calcined sample, both 31P 
and 27Al 
MAS NMR spectra of it are significantly changed (Figures 6 and 
7) indicating the Occurrence of a structural transformation. A 
deconvolution of the 31P 
spectrum reveals the presence of five peaks 
at -22.6, -25.7, -26.9, -29.1, and -31.1 ppm in the intensity ratio 
l:l:l:l:4.5, 
while the 27AI spectrum of hydrated calcined n- 
DPA-VPI-5 shows the presence of 4- and 6-coordinate AI in the 
intensity ratio 2:l. 
Because VPI-5 contains 6-coordinate 
framework AI, it is difficult to know whether or not the 6-coor- 
dinate AI atoms observed in the 27AI 
spectrum of the rehydrated 
calcined sample belong to the framework. We have therefore 
investigated the effect of water upon 
the chemical environments 
of P and AI atoms in calcined n-DPA-VPI-5: the 31P spectrum 
of a sample carefully dehydrated at 200 O
C
 
under vacuum is poorly 
resolved, and the relative intensities of the signals are altered. The 
spectrum, particularly the relative intensities of the peaks, 
depends upon calcination conditions and the hydration state of 
the calcined sample. The 27AI 
spectrum of an anhydrous calcined 
sample shows a significant decrease in the intensity of the octa- 
hedral aluminum signal and a small amount of AI species at ca. 
5.5 ppm. 
Adsorption of N2 
on 
calcined VPI-5 gives the surface area to 
be ca. 117 m2/g, corresponding to 3 N2 
molecules/unit cell of 
VPI-5. This indicates that the pores are almost completely blocked 
by the extraframework species produced during calcination. 
Several groups of researchers have suggested that the reason 
for the irreversible phase transformation in VPI-5 may be the 
presence of impuritie..' 
Derouane et al.' claim that such 
impurities can be removed with hot ethanol. Following their 
procedures precisely, we washed our n-DPA-VPI-5 with hot ab- 
solute ethanol at 60 "C for 1 h and calcined the washed sample 
at 200 O
C
 for 1.5 h. However, XRD showed that the washing 
does not prevent the onset of structural transformation.

What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
