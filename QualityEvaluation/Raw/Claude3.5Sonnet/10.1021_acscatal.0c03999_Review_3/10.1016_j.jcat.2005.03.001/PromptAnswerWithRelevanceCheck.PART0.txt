What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the causes of deactivation for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, nor does it compare various regeneration methods for these catalysts. The document focuses on gallium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, rather than Cr or V-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

[1] "The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity"

[3] "As regards the promoting effect of CO2, the reverse water gas shift reaction (6) and the Boudouard reaction (7) may play positive roles in the dehydrogenation reaction:
CO2 + H2 CO + H2O,
(6)
C + CO2 CO.
(7)"

[4] "Reaction (6) transforms H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O and shifts the reactions (2), (3), and (4) to the product side, lead-ing to the enhancement of the total reaction rate. Meanwhile, reaction (7) removes the carbon deposit from the catalyst surface and improves the stability of the catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include thermal cracking reactions leading to coke formation and the production of light alkanes. These processes result in decreased product yield and increased catalyst deactivation.

Various regeneration methods have been explored, with CO2 emerging as a promising oxidant. CO2 has been shown to promote high propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effectiveness of CO2 as a regeneration agent is attributed to two key reactions:

1. The reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), which enhances the overall reaction rate by shifting the equilibrium towards the products.

2. The Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 → CO), which helps remove carbon deposits from the catalyst surface, improving catalyst stability.

While the literature does not provide specific comparisons of different regeneration methods or their temperature requirements, it suggests that CO2 addition can be effective in mitigating catalyst deactivation and improving selectivity. The promoting effect of CO2 becomes more significant at higher temperatures, particularly above 550°C for gallium oxide catalysts.

The literature does not specifically address the comparison of regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the principles discussed for gallium oxide catalysts may be applicable to other metal oxide systems, suggesting that CO2 could potentially play a beneficial role in regenerating and stabilizing various catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括导致积碳形成和轻烷烃生成的热裂解反应。这些过程导致产品产率下降和催化剂失活增加。

研究人员探索了各种再生方法，其中CO2作为氧化剂显示出promising前景。CO2已被证明可以在丙烷氧化脱氢中促进高丙烯选择性。CO2作为再生剂的有效性归因于两个关键反应：

1. 逆水气变换反应（CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O），通过将平衡向产物方向移动来增强整体反应速率。

2. Boudouard反应（C + CO2 → CO），有助于去除催化剂表面的碳沉积，改善催化剂稳定性。

虽然文献没有提供不同再生方法或其温度要求的具体比较，但它表明CO2的添加可以有效减少催化剂失活并提高选择性。对于氧化镓催化剂，CO2的促进作用在较高温度下（特别是550°C以上）变得更加显著。

文献并未具体讨论Cr基和VOx催化剂的再生方法比较，或CO2添加在减少VOx催化反应过度氧化方面的潜力。然而，对氧化镓催化剂讨论的原理可能适用于其他金属氧化物系统，这表明CO2可能在再生和稳定各种用于氧化脱氢过程的催化剂方面发挥有益作用。
