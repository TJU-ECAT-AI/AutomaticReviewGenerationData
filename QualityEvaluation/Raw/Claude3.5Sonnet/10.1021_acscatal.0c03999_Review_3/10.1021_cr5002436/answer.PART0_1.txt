[1] "Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

[2] "The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."

[3] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species."

[5] "The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield. Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts.

2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion in regeneration can cause chromia to be incorporated into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.

3. Formation of inactive species: The diffusion and incorporation of Cr3+ into alumina can produce an inactive chromiaalumina spinel.

4. Reduction of active species: Similar to CrOx, MoO3 and VOx catalysts can be reduced by the hydrocarbon feed, potentially leading to less active species.

Regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with air: This is the most common method for regenerating coked catalysts. It is effective in removing coke deposits but can lead to the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts.

2. CO2 addition: This method can help decrease coke deposition and assist in product desorption. It may be particularly beneficial for VOx-catalyzed reactions by mitigating overoxidation.

3. Steam addition: Similar to CO2, steam can help reduce coke deposition.

The temperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to reaction temperatures, as coke can be easily combusted in air at these temperatures. However, higher temperatures during regeneration can accelerate the incorporation of active species into the support, leading to irreversible deactivation.

The impact on catalytic performance varies:

- Air regeneration can restore most of the initial activity but may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over multiple cycles.
- CO2 and steam addition can improve catalyst stability and olefin yield, but may also competitively adsorb on active sites.

Overall, while regeneration methods are effective in removing coke and restoring activity, they may also contribute to long-term catalyst deactivation, particularly for Cr-based catalysts. The use of CO2 or steam as mild oxidants shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and mitigating some deactivation mechanisms.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳沉积：这是CrOx脱氢催化剂活性损失的主要原因。

2. 活性物种进入载体：对于Cr基催化剂，再生过程中积碳燃烧释放的热量可能导致氧化铬进入氧化铝骨架，减少催化活性Cr物种的数量。

3. 形成非活性物种：Cr3+向氧化铝的扩散和掺入可能产生一种对脱氢反应无活性的铬铝尖晶石。

4. 活性物种的还原：类似于CrOx，MoO3和VOx催化剂可能被烃类原料还原，可能导致活性降低。

再生方法及其有效性：

1. 空气再氧化：这是去除积碳最常用的方法。它能有效去除积碳沉积物，但对Cr基催化剂可能导致活性物种进入载体。

2. CO2添加：这种方法可以帮助减少积碳沉积并辅助产物脱附。对VOx催化的反应可能特别有益，因为它可以减轻过度氧化。

3. 蒸汽添加：类似于CO2，蒸汽可以帮助减少积碳沉积。

再生所需的温度通常与反应温度相似，因为在这些温度下积碳可以在空气中容易燃烧。然而，再生过程中较高的温度可能加速活性物种进入载体，导致不可逆失活。

对催化性能的影响各不相同：

- 空气再生可以恢复大部分初始活性，但可能导致多个循环后活性位点逐渐损失。
- CO2和蒸汽的添加可以提高催化剂稳定性和烯烃产率，但也可能在活性位点上竞争吸附。

总的来说，虽然再生方法能有效去除积碳并恢复活性，但也可能导致催化剂长期失活，特别是对Cr基催化剂。使用CO2或蒸汽作为温和氧化剂显示出在维持催化剂性能和减轻某些失活机制方面的潜力。
