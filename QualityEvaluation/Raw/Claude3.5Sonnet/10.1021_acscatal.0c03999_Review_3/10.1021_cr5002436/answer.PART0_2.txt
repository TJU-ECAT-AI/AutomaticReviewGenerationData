[1] "Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

[2] "The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."

[3] "Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species."

[4] "The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield. Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

[5] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts.

2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion in regeneration can cause chromia to incorporate into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.

3. Reduction of active species: Similar to MoO3 catalysts, VOx catalysts may be reduced by the hydrocarbon feed, changing the oxidation state of the active species.

Regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with air: This is the most common method, effectively burning off coke deposits. However, for Cr-based catalysts, the heat released can lead to irreversible deactivation through incorporation of Cr into the support.

2. CO2 addition: This milder oxidant can effectively consume H2 and assist in coke removal through the Boudouart reaction. It has the added benefit of not being reactive enough to oxidize hydrocarbons, potentially mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

3. Steam addition: Similar to CO2, steam can help decrease coke deposition and assist in product desorption.

The temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given quotes. However, it's implied that the temperatures are high enough to combust coke and cause structural changes in the catalysts.

The impact on catalytic performance varies:

1. Air regeneration can restore activity but may lead to gradual irreversible deactivation in Cr-based catalysts.

2. CO2 addition can improve olefin yield and potentially extend catalyst lifetime by reducing coke formation and mitigating overoxidation.

3. Steam addition can also improve catalyst performance by reducing coke formation and assisting product desorption.

In summary, while air regeneration is effective for coke removal, the addition of CO2 or steam during the reaction or regeneration process may offer advantages in terms of maintaining catalytic performance and mitigating some causes of deactivation, particularly for VOx catalysts where overoxidation is a concern.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 积碳沉积：这是CrOx脱氢催化剂活性损失的主要原因。

2. 活性物种融入载体：对于基于Cr的催化剂，在再生过程中焦炭燃烧释放的热量可能导致氧化铬融入氧化铝骨架，减少催化活性Cr物种的数量。

3. 活性物种的还原：类似于MoO3催化剂，VOx催化剂可能被碳氢化合物原料还原，改变活性物种的氧化态。

再生方法及其有效性：

1. 空气再氧化：这是最常见的方法，能有效燃烧积碳沉积物。然而，对于基于Cr的催化剂，释放的热量可能导致Cr融入载体，造成不可逆失活。

2. 添加CO2：这种较温和的氧化剂可以有效消耗H2并通过Boudouart反应协助去除积碳。它还有不会氧化碳氢化合物的额外优势，可能减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。

3. 添加蒸汽：类似于CO2，蒸汽可以帮助减少积碳沉积并协助产物脱附。

再生所需的温度在给定的引文中没有明确说明。但是，暗示温度足够高，可以燃烧积碳并导致催化剂的结构变化。

对催化性能的影响各不相同：

1. 空气再生可以恢复活性，但可能导致基于Cr的催化剂逐渐不可逆失活。

2. 添加CO2可以提高烯烃产率，并通过减少积碳形成和缓解过度氧化来潜在延长催化剂寿命。

3. 添加蒸汽也可以通过减少积碳形成和协助产物脱附来改善催化剂性能。

总之，虽然空气再生对于去除积碳是有效的，但在反应或再生过程中添加CO2或蒸汽可能在保持催化性能和缓解某些失活原因方面提供优势，特别是对于VOx催化剂，其中过度氧化是一个问题。
