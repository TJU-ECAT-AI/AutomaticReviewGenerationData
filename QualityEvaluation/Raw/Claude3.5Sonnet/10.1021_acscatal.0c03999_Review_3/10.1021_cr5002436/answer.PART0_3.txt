[1] "Notably, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."

[2] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."

[3] "The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction."

[4] "In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction."

[5] "When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition on active sites
2. Strong adsorption of reactants on active sites
3. Sintering of metal oxide species, forming larger crystallites or mixed oxides
4. Reduction of active metal oxide species (e.g., Fe2O3 to Fe3O4)

Various regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2:
- Effective for removing coke deposits through calcination
- Can revert V2O5 crystallites to active polymeric vanadium species (at 600°C)
- May cause further deactivation due to sintering of metal oxide species

2. CO2 addition:
- Acts as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields
- Helps remove acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions
- Assists in coke gasification
- Oxidizes overly reduced vanadium centers
- Removes hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions

3. Promoter addition:
- MgO addition improves performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation
- Potassium addition enhances catalyst stability by forming KFeO2, which prevents reduction of active iron species

Temperature requirements vary depending on the regeneration method. Calcination for coke removal and reoxidation with oxygen typically require higher temperatures (e.g., 600°C for V2O5 crystallite reversion). CO2 addition can be effective at lower temperatures and during the reaction itself.

The impact on catalytic performance depends on the regeneration method used. While coke removal and reoxidation can restore activity, repeated high-temperature treatments may lead to irreversible deactivation due to sintering and formation of less active species. CO2 addition can improve performance by increasing alkene yields and mitigating overoxidation, particularly in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬和钒氧化物的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 活性位上的积碳沉积
2. 反应物在活性位上的强吸附
3. 金属氧化物物种的烧结，形成更大的晶体或混合氧化物
4. 活性金属氧化物物种的还原（如Fe2O3还原为Fe3O4）

各种再生方法及其有效性：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：
- 通过焙烧有效去除积碳沉积物
- 可以将V2O5晶体恢复为活性聚合钒物种（在600°C下）
- 可能由于金属氧化物物种的烧结而导致进一步失活

2. 添加CO2：
- 作为温和的氧化剂增加烯烃产率
- 有助于去除催化不需要副反应的酸性位点
- 辅助积碳气化
- 氧化过度还原的钒中心
- 通过逆水气变换反应去除氢气
- 减轻钒氧化物催化反应中的过度氧化

3. 添加促进剂：
- 添加MgO可通过减少积碳形成来改善支持的钒催化剂的性能
- 添加钾可通过形成KFeO2来增强催化剂稳定性，防止活性铁物种的还原

再生方法的温度要求各不相同。焙烧去除积碳和用氧再氧化通常需要较高的温度（例如，V2O5晶体恢复需600°C）。CO2添加可在较低温度下和反应过程中有效。

对催化性能的影响取决于所使用的再生方法。虽然去除积碳和再氧化可以恢复活性，但重复的高温处理可能导致不可逆的失活，这是由于烧结和形成较不活跃的物种。CO2的添加可以通过增加烯烃产率和减轻过度氧化来改善性能，特别是在钒氧化物催化的反应中。
