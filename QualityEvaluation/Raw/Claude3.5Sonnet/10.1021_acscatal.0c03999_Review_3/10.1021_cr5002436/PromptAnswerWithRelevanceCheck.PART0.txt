[1] "Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

[2] "The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."

[3] "Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species."

[4] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

[5] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for both Cr-based and VOx catalysts.

2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion can cause chromia to incorporate into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.

3. Reduction of active species: The hydrocarbon feed can reduce the active metal oxide species (e.g., Mo6+ to lower oxidation states), potentially altering their catalytic activity.

Regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with air: This is the most common method. It effectively removes coke deposits but can lead to the incorporation of active species into the support, especially for Cr-based catalysts.

2. CO2 addition: This can help reduce coke formation and assist in product desorption. For VOx catalysts, it may help mitigate overoxidation.

3. Steam addition: Like CO2, steam can help reduce coke deposition through the Boudouart reaction.

4. Hydrogen addition: This can also help control coke formation.

Temperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to reaction temperatures, as coke can be easily combusted in air at these temperatures.

The impact on catalytic performance varies:

1. Air regeneration can restore activity but may lead to gradual irreversible deactivation, especially for Cr-based catalysts.

2. CO2 and steam addition during reaction or regeneration can help maintain activity by reducing coke formation, but may have other effects on the reaction equilibrium.

3. For VOx catalysts, CO2 addition shows promise in mitigating overoxidation while still assisting in coke removal.

Overall, while these regeneration methods can effectively remove coke and restore some activity, they may not fully address all forms of deactivation, particularly the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts. Balancing the regeneration conditions to maximize coke removal while minimizing irreversible deactivation is crucial for maintaining long-term catalytic performance.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 积碳沉积：这是Cr基和VOx催化剂活性损失的主要原因。

2. 活性物种进入载体：对于Cr基催化剂，焦炭燃烧释放的热量可能导致氧化铬进入氧化铝骨架，减少催化活性Cr物种的数量。

3. 活性物种的还原：烃类原料可以将活性金属氧化物物种还原（例如，Mo6+还原为低价态），可能改变其催化活性。

再生方法及其有效性：

1. 空气再氧化：这是最常见的方法。它能有效去除焦炭沉积物，但可能导致活性物种进入载体，特别是对于Cr基催化剂。

2. 添加CO2：这可以帮助减少焦炭形成并辅助产物脱附。对于VOx催化剂，它可能有助于减轻过度氧化。

3. 添加蒸汽：与CO2类似，蒸汽可以通过Boudouart反应帮助减少焦炭沉积。

4. 添加氢气：这也可以帮助控制焦炭形成。

再生所需的温度通常与反应温度相似，因为在这些温度下焦炭可以在空气中容易燃烧。

对催化性能的影响各不相同：

1. 空气再生可以恢复活性，但可能导致逐渐的不可逆失活，特别是对于Cr基催化剂。

2. 在反应或再生过程中添加CO2和蒸汽可以通过减少焦炭形成来帮助维持活性，但可能对反应平衡有其他影响。

3. 对于VOx催化剂，添加CO2在减轻过度氧化的同时仍能辅助焦炭去除，显示出良好前景。

总的来说，虽然这些再生方法可以有效去除焦炭并恢复部分活性，但它们可能无法完全解决所有形式的失活，特别是Cr基催化剂中活性物种进入载体的问题。平衡再生条件以最大化焦炭去除同时最小化不可逆失活对维持长期催化性能至关重要。

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts.

2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion in regeneration can cause chromia to be incorporated into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.

3. Formation of inactive species: The diffusion and incorporation of Cr3+ into alumina can produce an inactive chromiaalumina spinel.

4. Reduction of active species: Similar to CrOx, MoO3 and VOx catalysts can be reduced by the hydrocarbon feed, potentially leading to less active species.

Regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with air: This is the most common method for regenerating coked catalysts. It is effective in removing coke deposits but can lead to the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts.

2. CO2 addition: This method can help decrease coke deposition and assist in product desorption. It may be particularly beneficial for VOx-catalyzed reactions by mitigating overoxidation.

3. Steam addition: Similar to CO2, steam can help reduce coke deposition.

The temperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to reaction temperatures, as coke can be easily combusted in air at these temperatures. However, higher temperatures during regeneration can accelerate the incorporation of active species into the support, leading to irreversible deactivation.

The impact on catalytic performance varies:

- Air regeneration can restore most of the initial activity but may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over multiple cycles.
- CO2 and steam addition can improve catalyst stability and olefin yield, but may also competitively adsorb on active sites.

Overall, while regeneration methods are effective in removing coke and restoring activity, they may also contribute to long-term catalyst deactivation, particularly for Cr-based catalysts. The use of CO2 or steam as mild oxidants shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and mitigating some deactivation mechanisms.

3. 蒸汽添加：类似于CO2，蒸汽可以帮助减少积碳沉积。

再生所需的温度通常与反应温度相似，因为在这些温度下积碳可以在空气中容易燃烧。然而，再生过程中较高的温度可能加速活性物种进入载体，导致不可逆失活。

对催化性能的影响各不相同：

- 空气再生可以恢复大部分初始活性，但可能导致多个循环后活性位点逐渐损失。
- CO2和蒸汽的添加可以提高催化剂稳定性和烯烃产率，但也可能在活性位点上竞争吸附。

总的来说，虽然再生方法能有效去除积碳并恢复活性，但也可能导致催化剂长期失活，特别是对Cr基催化剂。使用CO2或蒸汽作为温和氧化剂显示出在维持催化剂性能和减轻某些失活机制方面的潜力。

[1] "Notably, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."

[2] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."

[3] "The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction."

[4] "In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction."

[5] "When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition on active sites
2. Strong adsorption of reactants on active sites
3. Sintering of metal oxide species, forming larger crystallites or mixed oxides
4. Reduction of active metal oxide species (e.g., Fe2O3 to Fe3O4)

Various regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2:
- Effective for removing coke deposits through calcination
- Can revert V2O5 crystallites to active polymeric vanadium species (at 600°C)
- May cause further deactivation due to sintering of metal oxide species

2. CO2 addition:
- Acts as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields
- Helps remove acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions
- Assists in coke gasification
- Oxidizes overly reduced vanadium centers
- Removes hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions

3. Promoter addition:
- MgO addition improves performance of supported vanadium catalysts by reducing coke formation
- Potassium addition enhances catalyst stability by forming KFeO2, which prevents reduction of active iron species

Temperature requirements vary depending on the regeneration method. Calcination for coke removal and reoxidation with oxygen typically require higher temperatures (e.g., 600°C for V2O5 crystallite reversion). CO2 addition can be effective at lower temperatures and during the reaction itself.

The impact on catalytic performance depends on the regeneration method used. While coke removal and reoxidation can restore activity, repeated high-temperature treatments may lead to irreversible deactivation due to sintering and formation of less active species. CO2 addition can improve performance by increasing alkene yields and mitigating overoxidation, particularly in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬和钒氧化物的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 活性位上的积碳沉积
2. 反应物在活性位上的强吸附
3. 金属氧化物物种的烧结，形成更大的晶体或混合氧化物
4. 活性金属氧化物物种的还原（如Fe2O3还原为Fe3O4）

各种再生方法及其有效性：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：
- 通过焙烧有效去除积碳沉积物
- 可以将V2O5晶体恢复为活性聚合钒物种（在600°C下）
- 可能由于金属氧化物物种的烧结而导致进一步失活

2. 添加CO2：
- 作为温和的氧化剂增加烯烃产率
- 有助于去除催化不需要副反应的酸性位点
- 辅助积碳气化
- 氧化过度还原的钒中心
- 通过逆水气变换反应去除氢气
- 减轻钒氧化物催化反应中的过度氧化

3. 添加促进剂：
- 添加MgO可通过减少积碳形成来改善支持的钒催化剂的性能
- 添加钾可通过形成KFeO2来增强催化剂稳定性，防止活性铁物种的还原

再生方法的温度要求各不相同。焙烧去除积碳和用氧再氧化通常需要较高的温度（例如，V2O5晶体恢复需600°C）。CO2添加可在较低温度下和反应过程中有效。

对催化性能的影响取决于所使用的再生方法。虽然去除积碳和再氧化可以恢复活性，但重复的高温处理可能导致不可逆的失活，这是由于烧结和形成较不活跃的物种。CO2的添加可以通过增加烯烃产率和减轻过度氧化来改善性能，特别是在钒氧化物催化的反应中。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition: Both Cr-based and VOx catalysts lose activity due to coke formation on their surfaces over time.

2. Over-reduction: VOx catalysts can be over-reduced, leading to less active species.

3. Sintering: At high temperatures, metal oxide particles can sinter, reducing active surface area.

Regeneration methods and their comparisons:

1. Reoxidation with air: This is the most common method, effective for burning off coke deposits. It requires high temperatures, which can cause thermal stress on the catalyst.

2. CO2 regeneration: CO2 can be used as a milder oxidant. It is less effective at removing coke than air, but it can help mitigate over-oxidation, especially for VOx catalysts. CO2 addition can also promote the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which can help maintain catalyst activity.

3. O2 regeneration: Pure oxygen is more effective than air for coke removal but carries a higher risk of over-oxidation and requires careful temperature control.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. CO2 addition shows promise for VOx catalysts by balancing coke removal with prevention of over-oxidation. However, air regeneration remains the most widely used method due to its effectiveness and simplicity.

Temperature requirements vary, but generally, regeneration temperatures are similar to or slightly higher than reaction temperatures. Lower temperatures are preferred to minimize thermal stress and sintering, but must be high enough to effectively remove coke.

The impact on catalytic performance can be significant. While regeneration can restore much of the initial activity, repeated cycles can lead to permanent deactivation through mechanisms like metal oxide incorporation into the support material or irreversible structural changes.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，重点关注基于Cr和VOx的催化剂：

1. 积碳沉积：Cr基和VOx催化剂随着时间的推移，其表面积碳形成导致活性降低。

2. 过度还原：VOx催化剂可能发生过度还原，导致形成活性较低的物种。

3. 烧结：在高温下，金属氧化物颗粒可能发生烧结，减少活性表面积。

再生方法及其比较：

1. 空气再氧化：这是最常见的方法，有效去除积碳沉积物。需要高温，可能对催化剂造成热应力。

2. CO2再生：CO2可作为较温和的氧化剂。虽然去除积碳的效果不如空气，但可以帮助缓解过度氧化，特别是对VOx催化剂。添加CO2还可以促进逆水气变换反应，有助于维持催化剂活性。

3. O2再生：纯氧比空气更有效地去除积碳，但过度氧化的风险更高，需要仔细控制温度。

这些方法的有效性取决于具体的催化剂和反应条件。CO2添加对VOx催化剂显示出良好前景，可以平衡积碳去除和防止过度氧化。然而，由于其有效性和简单性，空气再生仍然是最广泛使用的方法。

温度要求各不相同，但通常再生温度与反应温度相似或略高。为了最大限度地减少热应力和烧结，首选较低的温度，但必须足够高以有效去除积碳。

对催化性能的影响可能很显著。虽然再生可以恢复大部分初始活性，但重复循环可能导致永久性失活，如金属氧化物掺入载体材料或不可逆的结构变化等机制。
