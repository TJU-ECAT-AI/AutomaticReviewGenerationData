[1] "Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

[2] "The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."

[3] "Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species."

[4] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

[5] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for both Cr-based and VOx catalysts.

2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion can cause chromia to incorporate into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.

3. Reduction of active species: The hydrocarbon feed can reduce the active metal oxide species (e.g., Mo6+ to lower oxidation states), potentially altering their catalytic activity.

Regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with air: This is the most common method. It effectively removes coke deposits but can lead to the incorporation of active species into the support, especially for Cr-based catalysts.

2. CO2 addition: This can help reduce coke formation and assist in product desorption. For VOx catalysts, it may help mitigate overoxidation.

3. Steam addition: Like CO2, steam can help reduce coke deposition through the Boudouart reaction.

4. Hydrogen addition: This can also help control coke formation.

Temperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to reaction temperatures, as coke can be easily combusted in air at these temperatures.

The impact on catalytic performance varies:

1. Air regeneration can restore activity but may lead to gradual irreversible deactivation, especially for Cr-based catalysts.

2. CO2 and steam addition during reaction or regeneration can help maintain activity by reducing coke formation, but may have other effects on the reaction equilibrium.

3. For VOx catalysts, CO2 addition shows promise in mitigating overoxidation while still assisting in coke removal.

Overall, while these regeneration methods can effectively remove coke and restore some activity, they may not fully address all forms of deactivation, particularly the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts. Balancing the regeneration conditions to maximize coke removal while minimizing irreversible deactivation is crucial for maintaining long-term catalytic performance.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 积碳沉积：这是Cr基和VOx催化剂活性损失的主要原因。

2. 活性物种进入载体：对于Cr基催化剂，焦炭燃烧释放的热量可能导致氧化铬进入氧化铝骨架，减少催化活性Cr物种的数量。

3. 活性物种的还原：烃类原料可以将活性金属氧化物物种还原（例如，Mo6+还原为低价态），可能改变其催化活性。

再生方法及其有效性：

1. 空气再氧化：这是最常见的方法。它能有效去除焦炭沉积物，但可能导致活性物种进入载体，特别是对于Cr基催化剂。

2. 添加CO2：这可以帮助减少焦炭形成并辅助产物脱附。对于VOx催化剂，它可能有助于减轻过度氧化。

3. 添加蒸汽：与CO2类似，蒸汽可以通过Boudouart反应帮助减少焦炭沉积。

4. 添加氢气：这也可以帮助控制焦炭形成。

再生所需的温度通常与反应温度相似，因为在这些温度下焦炭可以在空气中容易燃烧。

对催化性能的影响各不相同：

1. 空气再生可以恢复活性，但可能导致逐渐的不可逆失活，特别是对于Cr基催化剂。

2. 在反应或再生过程中添加CO2和蒸汽可以通过减少焦炭形成来帮助维持活性，但可能对反应平衡有其他影响。

3. 对于VOx催化剂，添加CO2在减轻过度氧化的同时仍能辅助焦炭去除，显示出良好前景。

总的来说，虽然这些再生方法可以有效去除焦炭并恢复部分活性，但它们可能无法完全解决所有形式的失活，特别是Cr基催化剂中活性物种进入载体的问题。平衡再生条件以最大化焦炭去除同时最小化不可逆失活对维持长期催化性能至关重要。
