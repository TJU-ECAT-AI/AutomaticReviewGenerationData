[1] "Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

[2] "Part of the heat required for the reaction is introduced to the reactors by preheating the reaction feed, additional heat being provided by adjacent reactors that are regenerating the coked catalysts."

[3] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[4] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."

[5] "CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition: Both Cr-based and VOx catalysts lose activity due to coke formation on their surfaces over time.

2. Over-reduction: VOx catalysts can be over-reduced, leading to less active species.

3. Sintering: At high temperatures, metal oxide particles can sinter, reducing active surface area.

Regeneration methods and their comparisons:

1. Reoxidation with air: This is the most common method, effective for burning off coke deposits. It requires high temperatures, which can cause thermal stress on the catalyst.

2. CO2 regeneration: CO2 can be used as a milder oxidant. It is less effective at removing coke than air, but it can help mitigate over-oxidation, especially for VOx catalysts. CO2 addition can also promote the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which can help maintain catalyst activity.

3. O2 regeneration: Pure oxygen is more effective than air for coke removal but carries a higher risk of over-oxidation and requires careful temperature control.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. CO2 addition shows promise for VOx catalysts by balancing coke removal with prevention of over-oxidation. However, air regeneration remains the most widely used method due to its effectiveness and simplicity.

Temperature requirements vary, but generally, regeneration temperatures are similar to or slightly higher than reaction temperatures. Lower temperatures are preferred to minimize thermal stress and sintering, but must be high enough to effectively remove coke.

The impact on catalytic performance can be significant. While regeneration can restore much of the initial activity, repeated cycles can lead to permanent deactivation through mechanisms like metal oxide incorporation into the support material or irreversible structural changes.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，重点关注基于Cr和VOx的催化剂：

1. 积碳沉积：Cr基和VOx催化剂随着时间的推移，其表面积碳形成导致活性降低。

2. 过度还原：VOx催化剂可能发生过度还原，导致形成活性较低的物种。

3. 烧结：在高温下，金属氧化物颗粒可能发生烧结，减少活性表面积。

再生方法及其比较：

1. 空气再氧化：这是最常见的方法，有效去除积碳沉积物。需要高温，可能对催化剂造成热应力。

2. CO2再生：CO2可作为较温和的氧化剂。虽然去除积碳的效果不如空气，但可以帮助缓解过度氧化，特别是对VOx催化剂。添加CO2还可以促进逆水气变换反应，有助于维持催化剂活性。

3. O2再生：纯氧比空气更有效地去除积碳，但过度氧化的风险更高，需要仔细控制温度。

这些方法的有效性取决于具体的催化剂和反应条件。CO2添加对VOx催化剂显示出良好前景，可以平衡积碳去除和防止过度氧化。然而，由于其有效性和简单性，空气再生仍然是最广泛使用的方法。

温度要求各不相同，但通常再生温度与反应温度相似或略高。为了最大限度地减少热应力和烧结，首选较低的温度，但必须足够高以有效去除积碳。

对催化性能的影响可能很显著。虽然再生可以恢复大部分初始活性，但重复循环可能导致永久性失活，如金属氧化物掺入载体材料或不可逆的结构变化等机制。
