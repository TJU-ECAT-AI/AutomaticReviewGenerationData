[1] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[2] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on metal oxide catalyst deactivation causes and regeneration methods for oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, it does offer some insights into the effects of CO2 on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The study suggests that catalyst deactivation occurs during propane dehydrogenation, as evidenced by the decrease in C3H6 yield over time.

2. CO2 effect on deactivation: The addition of CO2 was found to suppress catalyst deactivation, resulting in a slower decrease in C3H6 yield compared to reactions without CO2.

3. Oxidation state: In the absence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface tends to be reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction. However, in the presence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface is maintained in a partially oxidized state.

4. Catalyst activity: The partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst is reported to be more active for propane dehydrogenation compared to the reduced form.

5. Regeneration: While not explicitly discussed as a regeneration method, the study implies that CO2 addition during the reaction helps maintain the catalyst in a more active state by preventing complete reduction of the Cr2O3 surface.

The study does not provide information on other metal oxide catalysts like VOx, nor does it compare different regeneration methods or discuss temperature requirements for regeneration. The focus is primarily on the positive effects of CO2 addition for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

该文献并未提供关于氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活原因和再生方法的全面信息。然而，它确实提供了一些关于CO2对丙烷脱氢Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂影响的见解：

1. 催化剂失活：研究表明，在丙烷脱氢过程中会发生催化剂失活，这从C3H6产率随时间的降低可以看出。

2. CO2对失活的影响：添加CO2被发现可以抑制催化剂失活，与无CO2的反应相比，C3H6产率降低得更慢。

3. 氧化态：在没有CO2的情况下，Cr2O3表面在脱氢反应过程中趋于被还原。然而，在CO2存在的情况下，Cr2O3表面保持在部分氧化状态。

4. 催化剂活性：部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂据报道比还原形式的催化剂对丙烷脱氢更具活性。

5. 再生：虽然没有明确讨论作为再生方法，但研究暗示在反应过程中添加CO2有助于通过防止Cr2O3表面完全还原来保持催化剂处于更活跃的状态。

该研究没有提供关于其他金属氧化物催化剂（如VOx）的信息，也没有比较不同的再生方法或讨论再生的温度要求。研究主要集中在CO2添加对丙烷脱氢Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的积极影响上。
