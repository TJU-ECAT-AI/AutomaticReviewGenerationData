[1] "The activity of the Cr203]AI203 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2."

[2] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[4] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, nor does it compare various regeneration methods in detail. However, it does offer some insights into the effects of CO2 on Cr-based catalysts:

1. The study shows that CO2 can suppress catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The yield of C3H6 decreased less over time when CO2 was present.

2. The promoting effect of CO2 appears to be related to maintaining the catalyst in a partially oxidized state. A partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was found to be more active for propane dehydrogenation than a reduced catalyst.

3. CO2 treatment was shown to increase catalyst activity after reduction with H2, suggesting that CO2 can reoxidize the catalyst surface to some extent.

4. The effect of CO2 was specific to SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and was not observed for Al2O3 or activated carbon supports.

The study does not provide information on VOx catalysts or compare different regeneration methods. It also does not discuss temperature requirements for regeneration or the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

该文献没有提供关于氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因的全面信息，也没有详细比较各种再生方法。但是，它确实提供了一些关于CO2对基于Cr的催化剂的影响的见解：

1. 研究表明，在丙烷脱氢反应中，CO2可以抑制Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的失活。当存在CO2时，C3H6的产率随时间的减少较少。

2. CO2的促进作用似乎与保持催化剂处于部分氧化状态有关。研究发现，部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比还原的催化剂对丙烷脱氢更活跃。

3. 实验表明，在用H2还原后，CO2处理可以增加催化剂活性，这表明CO2在某种程度上可以重新氧化催化剂表面。

4. CO2的效果仅对SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂有效，对Al2O3或活性炭负载的催化剂未观察到这种效果。

该研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂的信息，也没有比较不同的再生方法。它也没有讨论再生的温度要求或CO2在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。

The literature does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx catalysts and various regeneration methods. However, based on the information provided about Cr-based catalysts:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The main cause appears to be reduction of the metal oxide surface during the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. CO2 as a regeneration method: CO2 addition shows promising results in suppressing catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. It helps maintain the catalyst surface in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for the dehydrogenation of propane.

3. Effectiveness: CO2 addition enhances the yield of propylene and suppresses catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. However, it's important to note that this effect was not observed for Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, where CO2 actually lowered the activity.

4. Temperature: The experiments were conducted at 823 K, but the optimal temperature for CO2-assisted regeneration is not explicitly stated.

5. Impact on catalytic performance: For Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, CO2 addition improves both initial activity and longevity of the catalyst.

The document does not provide information on VOx catalysts or compare different regeneration methods beyond CO2 addition. It also doesn't discuss the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

文献并未全面回答所有问题，特别是关于VOx催化剂和各种再生方法的问题。但是，根据所提供的关于Cr基催化剂的信息：

1. 催化剂失活：主要原因似乎是脱氢反应过程中金属氧化物表面的还原。

2. CO2作为再生方法：对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2的添加在抑制催化剂失活方面显示出有希望的结果。它有助于保持催化剂表面处于部分氧化状态，这对丙烷脱氢更加活跃。

3. 有效性：对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2的添加提高了丙烯的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。然而，需要注意的是，这种效果并未在Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂上观察到，在那里CO2实际上降低了活性。

4. 温度：实验在823 K下进行，但未明确说明CO2辅助再生的最佳温度。

5. 对催化性能的影响：对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2的添加提高了催化剂的初始活性和寿命。

该文档未提供关于VOx催化剂的信息，也未比较除CO2添加之外的不同再生方法。它也没有讨论CO2在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。

[1] "The presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The literature primarily focuses on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of deactivation causes and regeneration methods for different metal oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the presented information:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The study suggests that reduction of the catalyst surface during the reaction leads to deactivation. This is evidenced by the observation that a partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst is more active than a reduced one.

2. Regeneration method - CO2 addition: The study demonstrates that CO2 addition has a positive effect on catalyst performance and longevity:
   - It enhances the yield of C3H6 (propylene)
   - It suppresses catalyst deactivation
   - It helps maintain the catalyst surface in a partially oxidized state

3. Temperature requirements: The experiments were conducted at 823 K (550°C), but the study doesn't compare this to other temperatures or regeneration methods.

4. Impact on catalytic performance: CO2 addition improved both initial activity and long-term stability of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

The study does not provide information on VOx catalysts or other regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air or O2. It also doesn't discuss the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. To fully answer the question, additional research on these aspects would be necessary.

这篇文献主要关注Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用，而非对不同金属氧化物催化剂的失活原因和再生方法进行全面比较。然而，我们可以从所提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 催化剂失活：研究表明，反应过程中催化剂表面的还原会导致失活。这一点从部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比还原态催化剂更活跃的观察结果中得到证实。

2. 再生方法 - CO2添加：研究表明，添加CO2对催化剂性能和寿命有积极影响：
   - 提高了C3H6（丙烯）的产率
   - 抑制了催化剂失活
   - 有助于保持催化剂表面处于部分氧化状态

3. 温度要求：实验在823 K（550°C）下进行，但研究没有将此与其他温度或再生方法进行比较。

4. 对催化性能的影响：添加CO2提高了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的初始活性和长期稳定性。

这项研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂或其他再生方法（如用空气或O2再氧化）的信息。它也没有讨论CO2在VOx催化反应中减缓过度氧化的潜力。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对这些方面进行额外的研究。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on metal oxide catalyst deactivation causes and regeneration methods for oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, it does offer some insights into the effects of CO2 on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The study suggests that catalyst deactivation occurs during propane dehydrogenation, as evidenced by the decrease in C3H6 yield over time.

2. CO2 effect on deactivation: The addition of CO2 was found to suppress catalyst deactivation, resulting in a slower decrease in C3H6 yield compared to reactions without CO2.

3. Oxidation state: In the absence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface tends to be reduced during the dehydrogenation reaction. However, in the presence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface is maintained in a partially oxidized state.

4. Catalyst activity: The partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst is reported to be more active for propane dehydrogenation compared to the reduced form.

5. Regeneration: While not explicitly discussed as a regeneration method, the study implies that CO2 addition during the reaction helps maintain the catalyst in a more active state by preventing complete reduction of the Cr2O3 surface.

The study does not provide information on other metal oxide catalysts like VOx, nor does it compare different regeneration methods or discuss temperature requirements for regeneration. The focus is primarily on the positive effects of CO2 addition for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

4. 催化剂活性：部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂据报道比还原形式的催化剂对丙烷脱氢更具活性。

5. 再生：虽然没有明确讨论作为再生方法，但研究暗示在反应过程中添加CO2有助于通过防止Cr2O3表面完全还原来保持催化剂处于更活跃的状态。

该研究没有提供关于其他金属氧化物催化剂（如VOx）的信息，也没有比较不同的再生方法或讨论再生的温度要求。研究主要集中在CO2添加对丙烷脱氢Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的积极影响上。

4. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, helping to reoxidize the catalyst surface during the reaction, thus maintaining its activity.

5. The effectiveness of CO2 in suppressing deactivation was demonstrated by comparing reactions with and without CO2, showing less decrease in C3H6 yield over time when CO2 was present.
