[1] "The activity of the Cr203]AI203 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2."

[2] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[4] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, nor does it compare various regeneration methods in detail. However, it does offer some insights into the effects of CO2 on Cr-based catalysts:

1. The study shows that CO2 can suppress catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The yield of C3H6 decreased less over time when CO2 was present.

2. The promoting effect of CO2 appears to be related to maintaining the catalyst in a partially oxidized state. A partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was found to be more active for propane dehydrogenation than a reduced catalyst.

3. CO2 treatment was shown to increase catalyst activity after reduction with H2, suggesting that CO2 can reoxidize the catalyst surface to some extent.

4. The effect of CO2 was specific to SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and was not observed for Al2O3 or activated carbon supports.

The study does not provide information on VOx catalysts or compare different regeneration methods. It also does not discuss temperature requirements for regeneration or the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

该文献没有提供关于氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因的全面信息，也没有详细比较各种再生方法。但是，它确实提供了一些关于CO2对基于Cr的催化剂的影响的见解：

1. 研究表明，在丙烷脱氢反应中，CO2可以抑制Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的失活。当存在CO2时，C3H6的产率随时间的减少较少。

2. CO2的促进作用似乎与保持催化剂处于部分氧化状态有关。研究发现，部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比还原的催化剂对丙烷脱氢更活跃。

3. 实验表明，在用H2还原后，CO2处理可以增加催化剂活性，这表明CO2在某种程度上可以重新氧化催化剂表面。

4. CO2的效果仅对SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂有效，对Al2O3或活性炭负载的催化剂未观察到这种效果。

该研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂的信息，也没有比较不同的再生方法。它也没有讨论再生的温度要求或CO2在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。
