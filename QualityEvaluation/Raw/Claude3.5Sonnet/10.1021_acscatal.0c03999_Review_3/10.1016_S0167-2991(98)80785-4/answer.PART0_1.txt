[1] "The activity of the Cr203/AI203 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2."

[2] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO,_, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx catalysts and various regeneration methods. However, based on the information provided about Cr-based catalysts:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The main cause appears to be reduction of the metal oxide surface during the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. CO2 as a regeneration method: CO2 addition shows promising results in suppressing catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. It helps maintain the catalyst surface in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for the dehydrogenation of propane.

3. Effectiveness: CO2 addition enhances the yield of propylene and suppresses catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. However, it's important to note that this effect was not observed for Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, where CO2 actually lowered the activity.

4. Temperature: The experiments were conducted at 823 K, but the optimal temperature for CO2-assisted regeneration is not explicitly stated.

5. Impact on catalytic performance: For Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, CO2 addition improves both initial activity and longevity of the catalyst.

The document does not provide information on VOx catalysts or compare different regeneration methods beyond CO2 addition. It also doesn't discuss the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

文献并未全面回答所有问题，特别是关于VOx催化剂和各种再生方法的问题。但是，根据所提供的关于Cr基催化剂的信息：

1. 催化剂失活：主要原因似乎是脱氢反应过程中金属氧化物表面的还原。

2. CO2作为再生方法：对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2的添加在抑制催化剂失活方面显示出有希望的结果。它有助于保持催化剂表面处于部分氧化状态，这对丙烷脱氢更加活跃。

3. 有效性：对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2的添加提高了丙烯的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。然而，需要注意的是，这种效果并未在Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂上观察到，在那里CO2实际上降低了活性。

4. 温度：实验在823 K下进行，但未明确说明CO2辅助再生的最佳温度。

5. 对催化性能的影响：对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2的添加提高了催化剂的初始活性和寿命。

该文档未提供关于VOx催化剂的信息，也未比较除CO2添加之外的不同再生方法。它也没有讨论CO2在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。
