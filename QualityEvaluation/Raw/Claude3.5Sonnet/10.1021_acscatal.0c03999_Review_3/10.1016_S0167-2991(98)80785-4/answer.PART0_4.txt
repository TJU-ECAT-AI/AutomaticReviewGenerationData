[1] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx catalysts and various regeneration methods. However, it does provide some insights into Cr-based catalysts and the effects of CO2:

1. For Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, deactivation appears to be related to the reduction of the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. CO2 addition was found to suppress catalyst deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

3. The mechanism of deactivation suppression by CO2 seems to involve maintaining the catalyst surface in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, helping to reoxidize the catalyst surface during the reaction, thus maintaining its activity.

5. The effectiveness of CO2 in suppressing deactivation was demonstrated by comparing reactions with and without CO2, showing less decrease in C3H6 yield over time when CO2 was present.

The literature does not provide information on other regeneration methods, temperature requirements, or the impact on catalytic performance for different regeneration techniques. It also does not discuss VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

这篇文献并未直接回答所有问题方面，特别是关于VOx催化剂和各种再生方法的内容。但它确实提供了一些关于基于Cr的催化剂和CO2效应的见解：

1. 对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，失活似乎与脱氢反应过程中催化剂表面的还原有关。

2. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，添加CO2可以抑制Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的失活。

3. CO2抑制失活的机制似乎涉及将催化剂表面保持在部分氧化状态，这种状态对脱氢反应更有活性。

4. CO2作为温和的氧化剂，有助于在反应过程中重新氧化催化剂表面，从而维持其活性。

5. CO2抑制失活的有效性通过比较有无CO2的反应来证明，结果显示在存在CO2时，C3H6产率随时间的降低较少。

这篇文献没有提供关于其他再生方法、温度要求或不同再生技术对催化性能影响的信息。它也没有讨论VOx催化剂或CO2在减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜力。
