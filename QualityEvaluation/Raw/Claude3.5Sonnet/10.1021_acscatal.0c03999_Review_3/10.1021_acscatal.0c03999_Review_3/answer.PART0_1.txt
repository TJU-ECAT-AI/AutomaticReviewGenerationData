[4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."

[5] "Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."

[6] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods are employed to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can usually recover most of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with this recovery being repeatable for at least 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While effective for complete recovery in the second cycle, CO2 regeneration becomes less effective in preventing further deactivation in subsequent cycles.

4. Co-feeding O2 during CO2ODHP: This approach promotes coke removal during the reaction but significantly decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

For VOx-catalyzed reactions, adding CO2 to the feed gas of C3H8/O2 can mitigate overoxidation. This approach decreases surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by altering adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites.

In summary, while various regeneration methods can effectively restore catalyst activity, they differ in their long-term effectiveness and impact on selectivity. The choice of regeneration method depends on the specific catalyst system and the desired balance between activity recovery and product selectivity.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。为解决这些问题，采用了多种再生方法：

1. 用空气或CO2再氧化：这种方法通常在高温（550-650°C）下应用，可以恢复大部分催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 用O2再生：对于CrOx/ZrO2催化剂，在600°C下用O2处理5分钟可以完全恢复活性，这种恢复至少可重复4个周期。

3. 用CO2再生：虽然在第二个周期可以完全恢复活性，但在随后的周期中，CO2再生在防止进一步失活方面的效果会降低。

4. 在CO2ODHP过程中共进料O2：这种方法可以促进反应过程中焦炭的去除，但会显著降低C3H6选择性和C2-C3烯烃选择性。

对于VOx催化的反应，在C3H8/O2进料气中添加CO2可以减少过度氧化。这种方法通过改变基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少了导致过度氧化的表面分子氧物种。

总之，虽然各种再生方法都能有效地恢复催化剂活性，但它们在长期效果和对选择性的影响方面存在差异。再生方法的选择取决于具体的催化剂体系以及所需的活性恢复和产品选择性之间的平衡。
