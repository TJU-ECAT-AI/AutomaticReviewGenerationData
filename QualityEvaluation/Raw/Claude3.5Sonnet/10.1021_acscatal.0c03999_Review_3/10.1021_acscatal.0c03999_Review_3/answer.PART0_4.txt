The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods have been explored to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can recover most of the activity and selectivity of the catalysts.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, and this recovery is repeatable for at least 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While it allows complete recovery in the second cycle, it cannot prevent further deactivation in subsequent cycles.

4. Co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP: This method promotes coke removal during the reaction but significantly decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

In terms of effectiveness, O2 regeneration appears to be the most efficient for Cr-based catalysts, offering complete and repeatable recovery. Air and CO2 regeneration methods are also effective but may have limitations in long-term use.

Temperature requirements for these regeneration methods typically range from 550°C to 650°C, with O2 regeneration specifically performed at 600°C.

Regarding the impact on catalytic performance, while these regeneration methods generally restore activity and selectivity, there can be trade-offs. For instance, co-feeding O2 during the reaction removes coke but reduces selectivity.

For VOx-catalyzed reactions, the addition of CO2 to the feed gas (C3H8/O2) shows promise in mitigating overoxidation. This approach decreases surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by adjusting adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites, potentially improving selectivity in the process.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是积碳和活性位点的还原。为解决这些问题，已经探索了多种再生方法：

1. 用空气或CO2再氧化：这种方法通常在高温（550-650°C）下进行，可以恢复大部分催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 用O2再生：对于CrOx/ZrO2催化剂，在600°C下用O2处理5分钟可以完全恢复活性，这种恢复至少可以重复4个循环。

3. 用CO2再生：虽然在第二个循环中可以完全恢复，但无法防止后续循环中的进一步失活。

4. 在CO2ODHP中共进料O2：这种方法可以在反应过程中促进积碳的去除，但会显著降低C3H6选择性和C2-C3烯烃选择性。

就有效性而言，O2再生对Cr基催化剂似乎最为有效，可以提供完全和可重复的恢复。空气和CO2再生方法也很有效，但在长期使用中可能存在局限性。

这些再生方法的温度要求通常在550°C到650°C之间，其中O2再生特别在600°C下进行。

关于对催化性能的影响，虽然这些再生方法通常能恢复活性和选择性，但可能存在权衡。例如，在反应过程中共进料O2可以去除积碳，但会降低选择性。

对于VOx催化的反应，向进料气（C3H8/O2）中添加CO2显示出减少过度氧化的潜力。这种方法通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少了负责过度氧化的表面分子氧物种，可能改善了过程的选择性。
