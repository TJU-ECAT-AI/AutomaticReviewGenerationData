          [1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."

[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."

[3] "For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."

[4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."

[5] "Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."

[6] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."

[7] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods have been studied to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can recover most of the activity and selectivity.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with this recovery being repeatable for at least 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While effective for complete recovery in the second cycle, it cannot prevent further deactivation in subsequent cycles. For VOx catalysts, CO2 cannot fully reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5 but can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4.

4. Co-feeding O2 during CO2ODHP: This approach promotes coke removal during the reaction but leads to a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

In terms of effectiveness, O2 regeneration appears to be the most efficient for Cr-based catalysts, offering complete and repeatable recovery. The temperature requirements for these regeneration methods are generally in the range of 550-650°C.

For VOx-catalyzed reactions, adding CO2 to the feed gas of C3H8/O2 has shown promise in mitigating overoxidation. This approach decreases surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites, potentially improving selectivity towards desired products.

The impact on catalytic performance varies depending on the regeneration method. While most methods can restore activity and selectivity, there are trade-offs. For instance, co-feeding O2 during the reaction removes coke but reduces selectivity. The choice of regeneration method depends on the specific catalyst system and the desired balance between activity recovery and product selectivity.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是积碳和活性位点的还原。为解决这些问题，研究了多种再生方法：

1. 用空气或CO2再氧化：这种方法通常在高温（550-650°C）下应用，可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。

2. 用O2再生：对于CrOx/ZrO2催化剂，在600°C下用O2再生5分钟可以完全恢复活性，这种恢复至少可以重复4个周期。

3. 用CO2再生：虽然在第二个周期可以完全恢复活性，但无法防止后续周期中的进一步失活。对于VOx催化剂，CO2不能将催化剂完全重新氧化为V2O5，但可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4。

4. 在CO2ODHP中共进料O2：这种方法可以促进反应过程中积碳的去除，但会导致C3H6选择性和C2-C3烯烃选择性显著降低。

就有效性而言，O2再生对Cr基催化剂似乎最为有效，可以提供完全和可重复的恢复。这些再生方法的温度要求通常在550-650°C范围内。

对于VOx催化的反应，在C3H8/O2进料气中添加CO2显示出减少过度氧化的潜力。这种方法通过调节碱性氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少了导致过度氧化的表面分子氧物种，可能改善了对目标产物的选择性。

对催化性能的影响因再生方法而异。虽然大多数方法可以恢复活性和选择性，但存在权衡。例如，在反应过程中共进料O2可以去除积碳，但会降低选择性。再生方法的选择取决于具体的催化剂体系以及所需的活性恢复和产品选择性之间的平衡。
