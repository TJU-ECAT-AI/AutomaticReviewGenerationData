The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods are employed to address these issues, with different levels of effectiveness and impact on catalytic performance.

Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) is widely used and generally recovers most of the activity and selectivity. For Cr-based catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with this recovery repeatable for at least 4 cycles. However, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows complete recovery in the second cycle, after which it cannot prevent further deactivation.

The effectiveness of regeneration methods depends on the preparation of the catalyst. Well-dispersed Cr species can achieve complete recovery of active sites, though this is generally challenging.

For VOx catalysts, CO2 cannot fully reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5 but can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4. Adding CO2 to the feed gas in VOx-catalyzed reactions can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. This is achieved by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites.

In summary, while O2-based regeneration methods are generally more effective for complete catalyst recovery, CO2 addition can play a crucial role in mitigating overoxidation, particularly for VOx catalysts. The choice of regeneration method should consider the specific catalyst composition, preparation method, and desired balance between activity recovery and selectivity improvement.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是积碳和活性位点的还原。为了解决这些问题，采用了各种再生方法，其效果和对催化性能的影响各不相同。

在高温（550-650°C）下用空气或CO2进行再生是广泛使用的方法，通常可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。对于基于Cr的催化剂，在600°C下用O2再生5分钟可以完全恢复活性，这种恢复至少可以重复4个循环。然而，使用CO2作为再生氧化剂只能在第二个循环中实现完全恢复，之后就无法防止催化剂进一步失活。

再生方法的有效性取决于催化剂的制备方法。良好分散的Cr物种可以实现活性位点的完全恢复，尽管这通常具有挑战性。

对于VOx催化剂，CO2不能将催化剂完全重新氧化为V2O5，但可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4。在VOx催化的反应中，向进料气中添加CO2可以通过减少表面分子氧物种来缓解过度氧化。这是通过调节碱性氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来实现的。

总之，虽然基于O2的再生方法通常对完全催化剂恢复更有效，但CO2的添加在减轻过度氧化方面可以发挥关键作用，特别是对于VOx催化剂。选择再生方法时应考虑特定的催化剂组成、制备方法以及在活性恢复和选择性改善之间所需的平衡。
