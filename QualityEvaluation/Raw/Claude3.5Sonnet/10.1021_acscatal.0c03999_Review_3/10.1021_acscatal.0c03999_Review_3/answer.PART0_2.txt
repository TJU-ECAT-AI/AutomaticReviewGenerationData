The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. For VOx catalysts, overoxidation is a major concern that impairs C3H6 selectivity.

Various regeneration methods have been studied to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can recover most of the activity and selectivity.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with recovery repeatable for up to 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While effective for complete recovery in the second cycle, it cannot prevent further deactivation in subsequent cycles.

4. Co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP: This approach promotes coke removal during the reaction but leads to a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

For VOx-catalyzed reactions, adding CO2 to the feed gas of C3H8/O2 has shown promise in mitigating overoxidation. This approach decreases surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites.

In summary, while various regeneration methods can effectively restore catalyst activity, they differ in their temperature requirements, impact on selectivity, and long-term effectiveness. The choice of regeneration method depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions, with a trade-off often observed between activity restoration and selectivity maintenance.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于基于铬的催化剂，是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。对于钒氧化物催化剂，过度氧化是影响丙烯选择性的主要问题。

研究了各种再生方法来解决这些问题：

1. 用空气或二氧化碳再氧化：这种方法广泛应用于高温（550-650°C），可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。

2. 用氧气再生：对于CrOx/ZrO2催化剂，在600°C下用氧气再生5分钟可以完全恢复活性，并且可以重复恢复4个循环。

3. 用二氧化碳再生：虽然在第二个循环中可以完全恢复，但无法防止后续循环中的进一步失活。

4. 在CO2ODHP中共进料O2：这种方法可以促进反应过程中焦炭的去除，但会导致丙烯选择性和C2-C3烯烃选择性显著降低。

对于钒氧化物催化的反应，在C3H8/O2进料气中添加CO2显示出减轻过度氧化的潜力。这种方法通过调节碱性氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少了导致过度氧化的表面分子氧物种。

总之，虽然各种再生方法可以有效恢复催化剂活性，但它们在温度要求、对选择性的影响和长期有效性方面存在差异。再生方法的选择取决于具体的催化剂和反应条件，通常需要在活性恢复和选择性维持之间权衡。
