What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

[1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."

[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."

[3] "For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."

[4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."

[5] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."

[6] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."

[7] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods are employed to address these issues, with different levels of effectiveness and impact on catalytic performance.

Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) is widely used and generally recovers most of the activity and selectivity. For Cr-based catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with this recovery repeatable for at least 4 cycles. However, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows complete recovery in the second cycle, after which it cannot prevent further deactivation.

The effectiveness of regeneration methods depends on the preparation of the catalyst. Well-dispersed Cr species can achieve complete recovery of active sites, though this is generally challenging.

For VOx catalysts, CO2 cannot fully reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5 but can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4. Adding CO2 to the feed gas in VOx-catalyzed reactions can mitigate overoxidation by decreasing surface molecular oxygen species. This is achieved by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites.

In summary, while O2-based regeneration methods are generally more effective for complete catalyst recovery, CO2 addition can play a crucial role in mitigating overoxidation, particularly for VOx catalysts. The choice of regeneration method should consider the specific catalyst composition, preparation method, and desired balance between activity recovery and selectivity improvement.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是积碳和活性位点的还原。为了解决这些问题，采用了各种再生方法，其效果和对催化性能的影响各不相同。

在高温（550-650°C）下用空气或CO2进行再生是广泛使用的方法，通常可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。对于基于Cr的催化剂，在600°C下用O2再生5分钟可以完全恢复活性，这种恢复至少可以重复4个循环。然而，使用CO2作为再生氧化剂只能在第二个循环中实现完全恢复，之后就无法防止催化剂进一步失活。

再生方法的有效性取决于催化剂的制备方法。良好分散的Cr物种可以实现活性位点的完全恢复，尽管这通常具有挑战性。

对于VOx催化剂，CO2不能将催化剂完全重新氧化为V2O5，但可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4。在VOx催化的反应中，向进料气中添加CO2可以通过减少表面分子氧物种来缓解过度氧化。这是通过调节碱性氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来实现的。

总之，虽然基于O2的再生方法通常对完全催化剂恢复更有效，但CO2的添加在减轻过度氧化方面可以发挥关键作用，特别是对于VOx催化剂。选择再生方法时应考虑特定的催化剂组成、制备方法以及在活性恢复和选择性改善之间所需的平衡。

In summary, while various regeneration methods can effectively restore catalyst activity, they differ in their long-term effectiveness and impact on selectivity.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。为解决这些问题，采用了多种再生方法：

1. 用空气或CO2再氧化：这种方法通常在高温（550-650°C）下应用，可以恢复大部分催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 用O2再生：对于CrOx/ZrO2催化剂，在600°C下用O2处理5分钟可以完全恢复活性，这种恢复至少可重复4个周期。

3. 用CO2再生：虽然在第二个周期可以完全恢复活性，但在随后的周期中，CO2再生在防止进一步失活方面的效果会降低。

4. 在CO2ODHP过程中共进料O2：这种方法可以促进反应过程中焦炭的去除，但会显著降低C3H6选择性和C2-C3烯烃选择性。

对于VOx催化的反应，在C3H8/O2进料气中添加CO2可以减少过度氧化。这种方法通过改变基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少了导致过度氧化的表面分子氧物种。

总之，虽然各种再生方法都能有效地恢复催化剂活性，但它们在长期效果和对选择性的影响方面存在差异。再生方法的选择取决于具体的催化剂体系以及所需的活性恢复和产品选择性之间的平衡。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. For VOx catalysts, overoxidation is a major concern that impairs C3H6 selectivity.

Various regeneration methods have been studied to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can recover most of the activity and selectivity.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with recovery repeatable for up to 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While effective for complete recovery in the second cycle, it cannot prevent further deactivation in subsequent cycles.

4. Co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP: This approach promotes coke removal during the reaction but leads to a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

In summary, while various regeneration methods can effectively restore catalyst activity, they differ in their temperature requirements, impact on selectivity, and long-term effectiveness. The choice of regeneration method depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions, with a trade-off often observed between activity restoration and selectivity maintenance.
