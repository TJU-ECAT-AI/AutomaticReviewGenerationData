The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. 

Various regeneration methods have been studied to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can recover most of the activity and selectivity.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with this recovery being repeatable for at least 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While this method allows complete recovery in the second cycle, it cannot prevent further deactivation in subsequent cycles.

4. Co-feeding O2 during CO2ODHP: This approach can promote coke removal during the reaction but leads to a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

In terms of effectiveness, O2 regeneration appears to be the most efficient for Cr-based catalysts, while CO2 regeneration shows limitations in long-term stability. The temperature requirements for these regeneration methods are generally in the range of 550-650°C.

For VOx-catalyzed reactions, the addition of CO2 to the feed gas (C3H8/O2) has shown promise in mitigating overoxidation. This approach decreases surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites, potentially improving selectivity towards desired products.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是积碳和活性位点的还原。

为解决这些问题，研究了多种再生方法：

1. 用空气或CO2再氧化：这种方法通常在高温（550-650°C）下应用，可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。

2. 用O2再生：对于CrOx/ZrO2催化剂，在600°C下用O2再生5分钟可以完全恢复活性，这种恢复至少可以重复4个周期。

3. 用CO2再生：虽然这种方法在第二个周期可以完全恢复活性，但无法防止后续周期的进一步失活。

4. 在CO2ODHP过程中共进料O2：这种方法可以促进反应过程中的积碳去除，但会导致C3H6选择性和C2-C3烯烃选择性显著下降。

就有效性而言，O2再生对于基于Cr的催化剂似乎是最有效的，而CO2再生在长期稳定性方面显示出局限性。这些再生方法的温度要求通常在550-650°C范围内。

对于VOx催化的反应，在进料气体（C3H8/O2）中添加CO2显示出减少过度氧化的潜力。这种方法通过调节碱性氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少了负责过度氧化的表面分子氧物种，可能改善了对目标产物的选择性。
