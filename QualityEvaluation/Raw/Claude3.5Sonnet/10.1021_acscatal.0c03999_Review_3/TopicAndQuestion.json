    "QuestionEnglish": "What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?",
    "QuestionChinese": "在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是铬基和钒氧化物催化剂）失活的主要原因是什么，以及各种再生方法（如用空气、二氧化碳或氧气再氧化）在有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响方面如何比较，包括二氧化碳添加在缓解钒氧化物催化反应中过度氧化方面的潜力？"
