The selective oxidation of propane on the vanadyl and bridging oxygen sites of the fully oxidized (001)
V2O5 surface and of an epitaxial vanadia monolayer supported on (001) TiO2 anatase is analysed using
periodic density functional theory (DFT). Both the oxidative dehydrogenation leading to propene and
the formation of oxygenated products, namely n-propanol, i-propanol, propanal and acetone, are inves-
tigated. Selective oxidation proceeds via a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism, and its elementary steps
on the vanadia surface are identified. Propane chemisorption preferentially occurs through a secondary
CAH bond activation via a direct hydrogen abstraction by a lattice oxygen. Supporting a vanadia mono-
layer on titania strongly enhances the CAH bond activation as compared to unsupported V2O5, yielding a
lower activation energy and a more exothermic propane chemisorption. In accordance with experimental
observations, the calculations show that the titania support not only modifies the activity of the vanadia
monolayer but it also affects the selectivity of the catalyst, favouring the formation of propene compared
to the formation of i-propanol and acetone. The vanadyl oxygen is overall the most active site on V2O5
and V2O5/TiO2, while the bridging oxygen is more selective towards propane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
The oxidation of hydrocarbons is of fundamental and techno-
logical interest because it provides a potential route to effectively
transform hydrocarbons to value-added and synthetically useful
chemicals and to reduce environmental pollution. Examples of
such processes are the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes
to olefins [13], the production of maleic anhydride from butane
[46] and of phthalic anhydride from o-xylene [79], and the elim-
ination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from exhaust
streams [10]. The selection or development of an appropriate cat-
alyst for each of these reactions is a challenging task. Theoretical
studies based on first principles can help to develop an under-
standing of the reaction mechanisms involved and the parameters
responsible for reactivity and selectivity. Moreover, ab initio calcu-
lations allow the determination of kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters, such as activation energies and reaction enthalpies,
needed for the development of a suitable microkinetic model.
Heterogeneous catalysts composed of transition metal oxides
are commonly used for the oxidation of hydrocarbons. Vanadium
oxide-based catalysts are employed as efficient catalysts in the oxi-
dative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, which is the reac-
tion of interest examined in the current study. The interest in this
reaction stems from the fact that the currently applied non-oxida-
tive dehydrogenation is an endothermic and therefore energy
intensive process, suffering from low propene yields due to cata-
lyst coking and methane formation. In contrast, the alternative oxi-
dative dehydrogenation is exothermic, because of the formation of
water, and does not lead to the formation of coke [11]. Earlier
experimental studies indicate that the selective oxidation of pro-
pane on vanadium oxides proceeds via a Marsvan Krevelen redox
mechanism that involves the reduction of the metal oxide surface
by the alkane with the formation of the alkene and water, followed
by reoxidation of the surface through gas-phase oxygen [12]. In
addition, selective oxidation reactions, like the oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane, can be considered as a first step towards the
total oxidation of propane [11,12]. Nevertheless, mechanistic de-
tails of the surface reactions and important elementary steps such
as the initial CAH bond activation remain to be elucidated. Fur-
thermore, a controversy still exists on the type of oxygen sites that
are active for selective oxidation reactions. The vanadyl O(1) site
has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical
oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions [1317]. Oth-
ers like Eon et al. [18] mentioned the importance of the doubly
coordinated bridging O(2) sites. On the other hand, according to
Ramirez et al. [19], the oxygen atoms that participate more readily
in the oxidation process correspond to the triply coordinated
bridging O(3) sites.
The goal of this theoretical study is to assess the activity and
selectivity of the different oxygen sites in propane selective oxida-
tion and to obtain a quantitative insight in the reaction mecha-
nism. In order to address the issue of selectivity, the reaction
network is not limited only to the oxidative dehydrogenation of

propane, which has been the subject of several theoretical studies
[2026], but includes also the formation of oxygenated products,
namely n-propanol, i-propanol, propanal and acetone. Addition-
ally, as vanadia is commonly used supported on another metal
oxide, for example, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, the effect of a strong interac-
tion of a TiO2 anatase support with the active vanadia phase on
propane activation and oxidation is investigated. Finally, although
selective oxidation reactions have already been studied theoreti-
cally on gas-phase vanadium oxide species [2730], on supported
catalysts
with
coverage
in
vanadia
below
the
monolayer
[20,21,3137] and on the (001) V2O5 surface [2326], this study
aims at exploring the reactivity of the monolayer vanadia catalyst,
thus bridging in the gap between isolated vanadia species and bulk
vanadia crystals.
2. Computational details

and

constants
a = 1151.2 pm,
b = 356.4 pm,
c = 436.8 pm
[38].
Its
unit
cell,
V4O10, comprises two formula units. In the crystal structure, the
layers are stacked in such a way that distorted VO6 octahedra are
formed with VAO bond distances varying between rather small
(158 pm) and quite large values (279 pm). This large value is indic-
ative of a weak van der Waals bond, which explains why V2O5 pre-
sents an easy cleavage parallel to the (001) plane [39].
Because of the easy cleavage parallel to the (001) plane, this
plane has been used in this study to model the fully oxidized
unsupported vanadia surface. For the construction of the possible
competing reaction pathways, all structurally and electronically
distinct oxygen sites, that is, singly coordinated vanadyl (O(1)),
doubly coordinated bridging (O(2)) and triply coordinated bridging
(O(3)) oxygen, of the catalyst have been taken into account. Peri-
odic density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been per-
formed for the (001) V2O5 surface using both single-layer and
double-layer slabs, in order to test whether there is any influence
of a second underlying vanadia layer on the surface reactivity. As
seen from Tables S1 and S2 of the Supporting information, a sin-
gle-layer slab seems adequate for modelling the oxidation reaction
at early stages and can essentially be used for modelling the com-
plete reaction at the bridging oxygen sites, where the surface
reconstruction due to the reaction with the hydrocarbon is either
minimal or very localized. However, when major surface recon-
structions occur involving important interlayer interactions (e.g.
creation of an interlayer bond due to oxygen vacancy formation
at the vanadyl site), a single-layer slab is certainly not accurate en-
ough. Moreover, a single-layer slab is missing the interlayer van
der Waals bonds, which can lead to an extra stabilization of the
reaction intermediate. Therefore, all data presented in this study
for the unsupported vanadia surface are obtained from a double-
layer slab model. As seen from Fig. 1, this model is a (1  2) super-
cell of (001) V2O5, which corresponds to a surface area of 0.83 nm2
(i.e. 1165.8 pm  715.1 pm) and a propane coverage of 1/8 ML (i.e.
one propane molecule per eight surface vanadium atoms).
The approach for modelling the V2O5 monolayer supported on
(001) TiO2 anatase is based on results obtained by several surface
characterization techniques [40] and assumes that the presence of
the titania anatase support alters significantly the structure of the
fully oxidized vanadia monolayer [41]. This model is constructed
by placing half monolayer of oxygen atoms on top of a pseudomor-
phic VO2 phase that extends the (001) TiO2 anatase structure. The
optimized structure for the V2O5/TiO2 model together with the
considered active sites is shown in Fig. 1. The vanadia monolayer
in this model is supported on a (3  2) supercell of (001) TiO2,
which
corresponds
to
a
surface
area
of
0.88 nm2
(i.e.
1150.2 pm  766.8 pm) and a propane coverage of 1/6 ML (i.e.
one propane molecule per six surface vanadium atoms).
Finally, it is worth mentioning that since the experimental sat-
uration coverage of propane on a metal oxide surface is 1/5 ML
[42], this study is carried out for a relatively high hydrocarbon
coverage.
2.2. Computational methods
The selective oxidation of propane on fully oxidized vanadia
surfaces is analysed using periodic density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. Density functional theory is widely used to
study this topic, as the investigated systems are of considerable
size and other methods are often not applicable due to unfavour-
able scaling properties.
Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations have been carried out
with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) using
plane-wave basis sets [43,44]. A plane-wave energy cut-off of
400 eV has been used in all cases. The projector augmented wave
method of Blchl [45] in the implementation of Kresse and Joubert
[46] has been chosen to describe the electronion interaction. To
account for the non-locality in the exchange correlation functional,
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) according to Per-
dew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) has been used [47]. The catalyst
is represented as an infinite system with periodic symmetry [48].
A conjugate-gradient algorithm has been utilized to relax the
atoms into their instantaneous ground state, assuming that con-
vergence is achieved when the forces are below 0.05 eV/Å. The di-
mer method [49] with the same convergence criteria has been used
to locate transition states on the potential energy surface. The
MonkhorstPack division scheme [50] has been chosen to generate
a set of k-points within the Brillouin zone. To improve the conver-
gence with respect to the number of k-points without affecting the
accuracy of the calculation, a Gaussian smearing [44,51] of 0.05 eV
has been applied. A 2  6  6 and a 6  6  2 k-point mesh were
found adequate for the bulk V2O5 and TiO2 anatase, respectively,

yielding cohesive energies that are converged within 1 meV.
Accordingly, a 2  3  1 k-point mesh was applied for the (1  2)
supercell of (001) V2O5 and for the (3  2) supercell of (001)
TiO2. A vacuum gap of 1.1 nm was found sufficient to separate
subsequent slabs, yielding surface energies that are converged
within 0.001 J/m2 and adsorption energies that are converged
within 1 kJ/mol. For the surface calculations, no symmetry was
used, and a dipole correction was included. All energies are calcu-
lated at 0 K and do not include zero-point vibrational energy
(ZPVE) corrections. Adsorption energies of propane on the surface
are calculated as follows
DEads  EC3H8=V2O5  EC3H8g  EV2O5
1
where EC3H8=V2O5 refers to the energy of the physisorbed or chemi-
sorbed complex, EC3H8g refers to the energy of an isolated propane
molecule in the gas phase and EV2O5 refers to the energy of the clean
vanadia surface. Positive values of DEads indicate endothermic pro-
cesses, while negative values indicate exothermic processes.
Additionally, in order to account for long-range dispersion
interactions, the calculated PBE energies corresponding to the opti-
mized structures have been corrected by performing single-point
calculations using the DFT-D2 method of Grimme [52] in the
implementation of Kerber et al. [53] for periodic systems, which
is denoted in this work as PBE+D. The addition of dispersion correc-
tions can change the relative energies of different intermediates on
the potential energy surface (see Figs. S1S3 of the Supporting
information), since dispersion corrections tend to increase the rel-
ative stability of adsorbed intermediates. This effect can be clearly
observed on the adsorption and desorption energies (see Tables
S3S5 of the Supporting information), which become more exo-
thermic and endothermic, respectively, when including dispersion
corrections. Therefore, unless stated otherwise, all results pre-
sented in this work include dispersion corrections.
After geometry optimization with PBE, an analysis of the spin
density is carried out for visualizing the location of unpaired elec-
trons on the reaction intermediates. However, because of the self-
interaction error of pure DFT, PBE incorrectly yields delocalized
solutions for defective states (e.g. oxygen vacancies) in many oxi-
des [5456]. Therefore, in order to describe properly these local-
ized states, PBE+U with an on-site Coulomb repulsion parameter
Ueff of 6.6 eV [57] for the V and Ti 3d-states has been used to cal-
culate the spin density. The spin density (s) is calculated as
s  qspin-up  qspin-down
2
with qspin-up and qspin-down being the spin-up and spin-down charge
densities. To obtain the number of unpaired electrons localized on
each atom, a Bader analysis [58,59] is performed on the spin
density.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Propane physisorption
A physisorption step is typically assumed before any reaction
takes place between the catalytic surface and the hydrocarbon.
Two distinct locations above the catalytic surface have been studied
for propane physisorption: on top of the vanadyl oxygen and in the
valley between two double rows of vanadyl oxygen. Considering
the possibilities of propane adsorbing on the catalytic surface, differ-
ent approaches of the adsorbate to the surface have been examined,
namely perpendicular or parallel to the surface and along or across
the [100] direction (see Table S3 of the Supporting information).
In Fig. 2, representative physisorbed states of propane over the
unsupported and supported vanadia surface are depicted, while
their respective physisorption energies are reported in the first
and third rows of Table 1. Propane is physisorbed parallel to the
surface with the difference in the preference between propane
positioned along or across the [100] direction being only marginal
(see Table S3 of the Supporting information). In all cases, a very
weak physical adsorption is observed with no significant changes
in the structure of the hydrocarbon and the surface. Interestingly
enough, the calculated physisorption energies correlate well with
the distance between the centre of mass of propane and that of
the surface layer, since the higher the physisorption energy, the
closer the hydrocarbon is to the surface (see Fig. 2 and Table 1).
The preferred location for propane physisorption is over the valley,
where the propane molecule is allowed to come closer to the sur-
face. However, this preference in the location for propane physi-
sorption is less pronounced in the supported vanadia surface
because of the tilted vanadyl groups (see Fig. 1), which make the
surface more flat with less distinct valley regions.
Kmper et al. [60] studied propane physisorption on the unsup-
ported (001) V2O5 surface using both molecular mechanics simu-
lations
and
microcalorimetry
measurements.
As
seen
from
Table 1, the calculated physisorption energies are in good agree-
ment with the physisorption energies obtained from the molecular
mechanics simulations, while the physisorption energy obtained
for the most stable physisorbed state is close to the experimentally
determined value. Although the orientation of physisorbed pro-
pane over the valley is similar to the one obtained from the molec-
ular mechanics simulations, that is, parallel to the surface and
along the [100] direction, propane appears to be closer to the sur-
face based on molecular mechanics (see Table 2). This difference
can be attributed to the fact that in the current study, only pure
DFT was used for geometry optimizations. In addition, as seen in
Table 2, the shortest oxygenhydrogen distance for both the
unsupported and supported vanadia is obtained with the vanadyl
oxygen, while molecular mechanics for the unsupported vanadia
yield that the doubly coordinated oxygen site is the closest one
to a hydrogen atom of propane.

bottom: valley) regions of the unsupported (V2O5) and supported (V2O5/TiO2)

oxygen atoms, green balls are titanium atoms, grey balls are carbon atoms and

Therefore, it should be kept in mind that although propane is
preferentially physisorbed in the valley where bridging oxygen
sites are located, the vanadyl oxygen sites are not so far away from
the hydrocarbon and should most certainly not be excluded as ac-
tive centres for subsequent reactions. Moreover, because of the
rather weak and non-specific interaction between the propane
molecule and the coordinatively saturated vanadia layer, the influ-
ence of the support is not important in propane physisorption.
3.2. Propane chemisorption
As seen from Fig. 3, all three types of bond activation have been
examined for propane chemisorption, namely CAH bond activation
at the primary or secondary position and CAC bond activation.
Moreover, propane chemisorption via a CAH bond activation can
be either a concerted [16] or a two-step process, the so-called re-
bound mechanism [20,6163]. The calculated activation and reac-
tion energies for these pathways are summarized in Table 3, while
energy diagrams for propane chemisorption on each of the oxygen
sites of the unsupported and supported catalyst are plotted in
Fig. 4.
In the first step of propane chemisorption via CAC bond activa-
tion (1 ? 4 in Fig. 3), a lattice oxygen attacks the CAC bond of pro-
pane, forming an adsorbed methoxide and a physisorbed ethyl
radical. Based on the activation energies of Table 3, most favour-
able sites for this step on either catalyst are O(1) and O(2), while
O(3) is the least reactive one. The support enhances the reactivity
of O(1) and O(2) for this step by lowering the activation energy for
these sites. The exact opposite happens in the case of O(3), which
loses reactivity when going from the unsupported to the supported
catalyst. However, due to the very high activation barriers for this
step (>280 kJ/mol), this mechanism is not considered further.
In the concerted mechanism of propane chemisorption via a
CAH bond activation (1 ? 2a, 1 ? 2b in Fig. 3), the addition of
the CAH bond on a VAO site leads to the formation of a metal hy-
dride and an adsorbed propoxide. In agreement with the order of
the CAH bond dissociation energies in propane [64], the activation
energies for addition of the secondary CAH bond are lower than
those for addition of the primary CAH bond (see Table 3). Based
on the activation energies of Table 3, O(1) and O(3) are most
favourable for the secondary CAH bond addition on the unsup-
ported catalyst, while O(1) and O(2) are most reactive for this step
on the supported catalyst. Due to important steric hindrances, no
transition state could be located for the secondary CAH bond addi-
tion on the O(3) site of the supported catalyst. Nevertheless, it is
unlikely for propane chemisorption to proceed via such a con-
certed mechanism, since the activation barriers are once again very
high (>270 kJ/mol).
Significantly lower activation energies are obtained when the
two-step mechanism of propane chemisorption via a CAH bond

activation is considered (see Fig. 4). The first step of this mecha-
nism is a direct hydrogen abstraction by a lattice oxygen (1 ? 3a,
1 ? 3b in Fig. 3), leading to the formation of a physisorbed propyl
radical and a surface hydroxyl group. In the second step of this
mechanism, the propyl radical can either bind to a vanadium atom
(3a ? 5a, 3b ? 5b in Fig. 3) or to a hydroxyl group (3a ? 6a,
3b ? 6b in Fig. 3) formed in the previous step or to another lattice
oxygen (3a ? 7a, 3b ? 7b in Fig. 3).
In agreement with the order of the CAH bond dissociation ener-
gies in propane [64], the activation energies for hydrogen abstrac-
tion from the secondary CAH bond are lower than those for
hydrogen abstraction from the primary CAH bond (see Table 3).
The activation energies for hydrogen abstraction are almost equal
on the different active sites of the unsupported catalyst, that is,
O(1)  O(2)  O(3), while they increase in the order O(1) < O(2) <
O(3) on the supported catalyst. The support clearly enhances the
reactivity of O(1) by lowering the activation energy for this site,
while the reactivity of O(3) is diminished when going from the
unsupported to the supported catalyst. Therefore, all oxygen sites
are almost equally preferable for hydrogen abstraction on the
unsupported vanadia surface, while there is a clear preference for
hydrogen abstraction to occur on the vanadyl oxygen in the case of
the supported vanadia surface. Assuming that the initial hydrogen
abstraction is potentially the rate-determining step of the oxidation
mechanism, this conclusion about the reactivity of the oxygen sites
of the unsupported catalyst inhydrogenabstractionjustifiesto some
extent the different proposals that have been put forward in the lit-
erature concerning the type of oxygen site that is active for catalytic
oxidation on the crystalline V2O5 phase [13,18,19].
Important geometric parameters of the transition states for the
hydrogen abstraction step on different active sites are reported in
Table 4, together with an energy decomposition analysis of the cor-
responding activation energies. As presented in Fig. 5, two different
schemes have been considered for the energy decomposition of the
activation barrier for CAH bond activation [65,66]. The apparent
activation energy, Eapp
act , can be divided into the energy cost for
the distortion of each reactant from the initial geometry to the
transition state geometry (i.e. DEsurf
dist for the surface, DEHC
dist for the
hydrocarbon) and the interaction energy between the distorted
reactants at the transition state (i.e. DEint), that is:
Eact  Eapp
act  DEphys  DEHC
dist  DEsurf
dist  DEint  DEphys
3
Alternatively, the CAH bond activation barrier can be decomposed
into the energy cost for the dissociation of the CAH bond in the
gas phase (i.e. DEbond) and the energy gain from the subsequent
adsorption of the two fragments at the transition state geometry
(i.e. DEH
ads, the adsorption energy of H on the surface, DErad
ads, the
adsorption energy of the propyl radical on the hydroxylated
surface):
Eact  Eapp
act  DEphys  DEbond  DEH
ads  DErad
ads  DEphys
4
As can be expected, DEHC
dist correlates well with the stretch of the
CAH bond, DEsurf
dist correlates well with the stretch of the OAV bond,
while DEH
ads correlates well with the HAO bond distance. As seen
from Table 4 for the supported catalyst, the reduced reactivity of
O(3) in hydrogen abstraction can be explained by the large energy
cost for surface and hydrocarbon distortion, which is needed since
this triply coordinated oxygen is pointing towards the bulk (see
Fig. 1) and is hardly accessible by the hydrocarbon.
In order to complete the chemisorption of propane on the van-
adia surface, the propyl radical formed after the hydrogen abstrac-
tion step should bind onto a surface site. According to the
activation energies of Table 3, almost in all cases the propyl radical
chemisorbs preferentially either on the hydroxyl group forming an
adsorbed propanol intermediate (6a, 6b in Fig. 3) or on another lat-
tice oxygen forming an adsorbed propoxide intermediate (7a, 7b in
Fig. 3). The only exception is the case of the triply coordinated O(3)
oxygen site of the supported monolayer vanadia catalyst, which is
the most sterically hindered site of the vanadia surface. As ob-
served from the reaction energies of Table 3 and illustrated in
Fig. 4, chemisorption of the propyl radical in this case is unfavour-
able, since the propyl radical is more stable in the physisorbed
state (intermediate 3) compared to any chemisorbed state (inter-
mediate 5 or 6 or 7) for this site. In addition, the following gas-
phase reactions can compete with propane chemisorption on the
O(3) site of the supported catalyst:
CH3 C
 HCH3 CH3CH2CH3 ! CH3CH2CH3 CH3 C
 HCH3;Eact  54kJ=mol
CH3CHC
 H2 CH3CH2CH3 ! CH3CH2CH3 CH3 C
 HCH3;Eact  53kJ=mol
where Eact is the activation energy calculated for these reactions at
300 K using the group additivity method of Sabbe et al. [67]. Finally,
since no decomposition pathways such as a- or b-elimination are
available after the formation of a CAV bond [16], the chemisorption
of the propyl radical on a vanadium atom (3a ? 5a, 3b ? 5b) can be
excluded from the reaction network of propane selective oxidation
over vanadia.

Based on the chemisorption energies of Table 5, the adsorbed i-
propoxide intermediate (7b) on the vanadyl oxygen (O(1)) is most
stable for both catalysts, while the presence of the titania support
strongly enhances propane chemisorption on this site. Results also
show that the stability of the adsorbed i-propoxide intermediate
(7b) decreases drastically with increasing the coordination number
of the oxygen site. The most stable form of chemisorbed propane
on both catalysts is shown in Fig. 6, while geometric parameters
are reported in Table 6. Most differences in the geometric param-
eters of chemisorbed propane between the unsupported and the
supported catalyst can be attributed to the tilted geometry of the
vanadyl groups of the supported vanadia surface (see VaVcOc value
of Table 6), which above all else stabilizes the abstracted hydrogen
to a greater extent than the unsupported vanadia surface (see OcH
value of Table 6).
3.3. Propanol formation
Starting from physisorbed propane, propanol formation can be
described as a sequence of the following steps (see Fig. 7): hydro-
gen abstraction from propane (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b), chemisorption of
the propyl radical on the hydroxyl group (3a ? 6a, 3b ? 6b) and
desorption of propanol (6a ? 9a, 6b ? 9b). Depending on whether
hydrogen is initially abstracted from the primary or secondary
CAH bond of propane, n-propanol or i-propanol will be formed,
respectively. All reaction paths considered in this study for pro-
pane oxidation to propanol are tabulated in Table S6 of the Sup-
porting information, while calculated activation and reaction
energies for the considered elementary steps are reported in Ta-
ble 3. Energy diagrams over the different active sites of the unsup-
ported and supported catalyst are shown in Fig. 8a.
As seen from Table 3, the desorption of propanol (6a ? 9a,
6b ? 9b) is an endothermic process. However, it is less energy
demanding than the removal of a lattice oxygen by itself (see Ta-
ble 7), since propane adsorption and reaction on the oxygen site
weakens the bonding of the lattice oxygen with the surface. A sim-
ilar effect has been reported by Hermann et al. [68] for hydrogen-
assisted oxygen desorption from the unsupported vanadia surface.
Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the desorption energies on
different oxygen sites do not need to follow the same order as
the oxygen vacancy formation energies. For example, for the
unsupported catalyst desorption energies increase in the order
O(1) < O(3) < O(2), while oxygen vacancy formation energies in-
crease with increasing coordination number of the oxygen site.
As illustrated in Fig. 9, desorption energies, DEdes, can be calculated
from the following thermodynamic cycle:
DEdes  DEvac  DEchem  DEox;gas
5
in which DEvac is the oxygen vacancy formation energy, DEchem is
the chemisorption energy of propane and DEox,gas is the reaction en-
ergy of propane oxidation in the gas phase. Therefore, the desorp-
tion
energy
does
not
depend
only
on
the
oxygen
vacancy
formation energy but is also influenced by the stability of the chem-
isorbed intermediate (i.e. DEchem), which decreases with increasing
the coordination number of the oxygen site (see Table 5).
As depicted in Table S6 of the Supporting information for the
unsupported catalyst, the propane oxidation to propanol on the
O(2) and O(3) sites appears to be limited by the propanol desorp-
tion energies (6a ? 9a, 6b ? 9b), while the propane oxidation to
propanol on the O(1) site seems to be hampered by the initial H
abstraction step (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b). On the other hand, in the case
of the supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanol appears
to be hindered either by the high desorption energy (6a ? 9a,
6b ? 9b) on the O(1) and O(2) sites or by the high initial activation
energy (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b) on the O(3) site, exhibiting barriers of
200 kJ/mol. Therefore, based on a comparison between the high-
est energy barriers found for the reaction paths considered (see Ta-
bles S6 and 3), the most reactive site of the unsupported catalyst is
the O(1) vanadyl site, with i-propanol formation being more
favourable than n-propanol formation on this site. Compared to
the unsupported catalyst, the supported catalyst is significantly
less active for propane oxidation to propanol, O(1) is only margin-
ally more reactive than the other sites on the supported surface
and no preference between the formation of n-propanol and
i-propanol is observed.
Overall, for both catalysts, the lowest energy pathways are ob-
tained on the vanadyl oxygen sites (see Fig. 8a). The state of the
catalytic surface after propane oxidation to propanol on O(1) is
shown in Fig. 10. For the unsupported catalyst, propane oxidation

to propanol leads to the creation of two V4+ sites, one in the surface
layer and one in the subsurface layer. On the other hand, for the
supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanol leads to the cre-
ation of one surface V3+ site.
3.4. Propanal/acetone formation
Starting from physisorbed propane, two different pathways
have been envisaged for propanal/acetone formation. The first path
(i.e. path I) can be described as a sequence of the following steps
(see Fig. 7): hydrogen abstraction from propane (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b),
chemisorption of the propyl radical on a free lattice oxygen
(3a ? 7a, 3b ? 7b), alpha hydrogen abstraction from the propox-
ide intermediate (7a ? 10a, 7b ? 10b) and desorption of prop-
anal/acetone (10a ? 11a, 10b ? 11b). The second path (i.e. path
II) consists of a sequence of the following steps (see Fig. 7): hydro-
gen abstraction from propane (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b), chemisorption of
the propyl radical on the hydroxyl group (3a ? 6a, 3b ? 6b),
hydrogen migration to free lattice oxygen (6a ? 7a, 6b ? 7b), al-

initially abstracted from the primary or secondary CAH bond of
propane, propanal or acetone will be formed, respectively. Due to
the relatively high hydrocarbon coverage (see computational de-
tails and Fig. 6), the active site for the second hydrogen abstraction
(7a ? 10a, 7b ? 10b) is chosen to be the hydroxyl group formed in
the activation step. The reaction paths considered for propane oxi-
dation to propanal/acetone are tabulated in Table S7 of the Sup-
porting information, while calculated activation and reaction
energies for the considered elementary steps are reported in Ta-
ble 3. Energy diagrams over the different active sites of the unsup-
ported and supported catalyst are shown in Fig. 8b.
As depicted in Table S7 of the Supporting information, paths I
and II are kinetically equivalent, since they share the same poten-
tially rate-limiting step in all cases, and a separate discussion on
each one of them is not needed. For the unsupported catalyst, pro-
pane oxidation to propanal or acetone on the O(2) and O(3) sites

can be expected to be hindered by the second H abstraction step
(7a ? 10a, 7b ? 10b), while the potentially rate-limiting step for
propane oxidation to propanol on the O(1) site is the initial H
abstraction step (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b). On the other hand, in the case
of the supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanal or acetone
is hindered mostly by the second H abstraction step (7a ? 10a,
7b ? 10b). Therefore, based on a comparison between the highest
energy barriers found for the reaction paths considered (see Tables
S7 and 3), the most reactive site of the unsupported catalyst is
O(1), with acetone formation being more favourable than propanal
formation on this site. O(1) is also the most reactive site of the sup-
ported catalyst, exhibiting a comparable activity as the one of the
unsupported catalyst, but without any preference between the for-
mation of acetone and propanal.
Overall, for both catalysts, the lowest energy pathways are ob-
tained on the vanadyl oxygen sites (see Fig. 8b). The state of the
catalytic surface after propane oxidation to propanal or acetone
on O(1) is shown in Fig. 11. For the unsupported catalyst, propane
oxidation to propanal or acetone leads to the creation of three sur-
face V4+ sites and one subsurface V4+ site. On the other hand, for
the supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanal or acetone
leads to the creation of two surface V4+ sites and one surface V3+
site.
3.5. Propene formation
Starting from physisorbed propane, three different pathways
have been envisaged for propene formation. The first path (i.e. path
I) consists of two consecutive hydrogen abstraction steps (see
Fig. 7): hydrogen abstraction from propane (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b) fol-
lowed by hydrogen abstraction from the propyl radical (3a ? 8,
3b ? 8). The second path (i.e. path II) can be described as a se-
quence of the following steps (see Fig. 7): hydrogen abstraction
from propane (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b), chemisorption of the propyl radical
on a free lattice oxygen (3a ? 7a, 3b ? 7b) and beta hydrogen
abstraction from the propoxide intermediate (7a ? 8, 7b ? 8).
The third path (i.e. path III) consists of the following steps (see

(6a ? 7a, 6b ? 7b) and beta hydrogen abstraction from the prop-
oxide intermediate (7a ? 8, 7b ? 8). Like in the case of propanal/
acetone formation, the hydroxyl group formed in the activation
step is considered to be the active site for the second hydrogen
abstraction. The reaction paths considered for propane dehydroge-
nation are tabulated in Table S8 of the Supporting informa-
tion, while calculated activation and reaction energies for the

considered elementary steps are reported in Table 3. Energy
diagrams over the different active sites of the unsupported and
supported catalyst are shown in Fig. 8c.
As depicted in Table S8 of the Supporting information, paths II
and III are kinetically equivalent, since they share the same poten-
tially rate-limiting step (i.e. beta H abstraction from the propoxide
intermediate: 7a ? 8, 7b ? 8) in all cases, and a separate discus-
sion on each one of them is not needed. On the other hand, the
potentially rate-limiting step of path I is in all cases the initial H
abstraction (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b). Therefore, based on a comparison be-
tween the highest energy barriers found for the reaction paths con-
sidered (see Tables S8 and 3), propene formation via an adsorbed
propoxide intermediate (path II or III) is less favourable than pro-
pene formation directly from the propyl radical (path I), that is,
without chemisorption of the propyl radical (3a ? 6a, 3a ? 7a,
3b ? 6b, 3b ? 7b). In addition, propene formation via an i-propyl
radical (3b) is more favourable than propene formation via a
n-propyl radical (3a).
Overall, for both catalysts, the lowest energy pathways are ob-
tained on the vanadyl oxygen sites (see Fig. 8c). The state of the
catalytic surface after propane dehydrogenation on O(1) is shown
in Fig. 12. For both catalysts, propane dehydrogenation leads to
the creation of two surface V4+ sites. Moreover, since the poten-
tially rate-limiting step for propene formation is the initial H
abstraction (1 ? 3b), the vanadyl site of the supported catalyst
can be expected to be more active in propane dehydrogenation
than the vanadyl site of the unsupported catalyst. However, unlike
the supported catalyst where propene formation is clearly fa-
voured on the vanadyl site, in the case of the unsupported catalyst,
the bridging oxygen (in particular the O(2) site) is equally active in
propane dehydrogenation as the vanadyl oxygen. Taking also into
account that the bridging oxygen sites are practically not active to-
wards oxygenation reactions (1 ? 9a, 1 ? 9b, 1 ? 11a, 1 ? 11b),
this means that these oxygen sites are more selective towards pro-
pane dehydrogenation.
3.6. Catalytic activity and selectivity
Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the
unsupported and supported vanadia surface. To find out whether
a dominant path exists on the investigated catalysts, the compet-
ing reaction pathways on the vanadyl oxygen site are compared.
Based on a comparison between the highest energy barriers of
the most favourable reaction pathways (Tables S6S8 of the Sup-
porting information), no dominant path can be identified for pro-
pane oxidation on the unsupported catalyst. Propane oxidation to
i-propanol or acetone and propane dehydrogenation are equally
favourable on the unsupported catalyst, since they share the same
potentially rate-limiting step, that is, the initial H abstraction
(1 ? 3b), with an energy barrier of 120 kJ/mol. On the other hand,
over the supported catalyst, propane dehydrogenation can be
expected to be the dominant reaction path. As mentioned in the
previous section, the potentially rate-limiting step of this path is
the initial H abstraction (1 ? 3b), with an energy barrier of 86 kJ/
mol. Therefore, propene can be expected to be the only product
of propane selective oxidation over the supported catalyst, while
both propene and oxygenates (i.e. i-propanol and acetone) can be
expected as products of propane selective oxidation over the
unsupported catalyst, which is in agreement with the experimen-
tal observations on these catalysts [69,70]. In addition, assuming
that the total oxidation of propane occurs via the parallel-consec-
utive scheme of Fig. 13 [11,12], supporting a vanadia monolayer
on titania will strongly favour the consecutive pathway via
propene formation over the direct combustion of propane.
Nevertheless, the two catalysts share some common features. In
both cases, the potentially rate-limiting step of propane oxidation
is the secondary CAH bond activation of propane via a direct H
abstraction (1 ? 3b), which is in agreement with experiment
[2,7173]. As seen from Fig. S4 of the Supporting information for
both catalysts, this rate-determining step is actually a spin-cross-
ing process with biradical transition states (see Fig. 14), which
