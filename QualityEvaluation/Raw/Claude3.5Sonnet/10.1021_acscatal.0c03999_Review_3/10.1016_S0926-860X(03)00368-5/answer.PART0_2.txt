[1] "Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]."

[2] "These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst. However, as was shown by the pulse reaction (Section 3.5.) the role of CO2 could be to eliminate deposited carbon (reaction 5)."

[3] "Pulse reaction study was performed for better understanding of the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane. Before reaction, samples of the fresh catalysts were reduced by a pulse of hydrogen or propane."

[4] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide. However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number. These results suggest that CO2 can remove the carbon deposit by the Boudouard reaction (4)."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation discussed in this literature is carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. The paper focuses on Ga2O3 catalysts rather than Cr-based or VOx catalysts.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature discusses the use of CO2 for regeneration. CO2 was found to eliminate deposited carbon through the Boudouard reaction. However, the effectiveness of CO2 in suppressing fast deactivation during the reaction was limited. The literature does not provide information on reoxidation with air or O2, nor does it compare different regeneration methods in terms of temperature requirements or impact on catalytic performance.

The paper does not discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Instead, it focuses on the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3 catalysts.

While the literature provides some insights into catalyst deactivation and regeneration using CO2, it does not fully address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding Cr-based and VOx catalysts or comparisons between different regeneration methods.

本文献中讨论的金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面的碳沉积。该论文主要关注Ga2O3催化剂，而不是基于Cr或VOx的催化剂。

关于再生方法，文献讨论了使用CO2进行再生。发现CO2可以通过Boudouard反应消除沉积的碳。然而，CO2在反应过程中抑制快速失活的效果有限。文献没有提供关于使用空气或O2进行再氧化的信息，也没有比较不同再生方法在温度要求或对催化性能影响方面的差异。

该论文没有讨论CO2添加在减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜力。相反，它主要关注CO2在Ga2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢中的作用。

虽然文献提供了一些关于催化剂失活和使用CO2再生的见解，但它并没有完全涵盖问题的所有方面，特别是关于基于Cr和VOx的催化剂或不同再生方法之间的比较。
