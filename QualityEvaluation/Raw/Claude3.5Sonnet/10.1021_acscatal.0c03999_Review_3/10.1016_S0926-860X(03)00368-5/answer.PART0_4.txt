[1] "Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]."

[2] "These results clearly indicate that the high temperature accelerates coke deposition on the Ga2O3 catalyst surface."

[3] "The carbon deposition is one of the major problems in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3. Coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of acid sites on the catalyst."

[4] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide. However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number. These results suggest that CO2 can remove the carbon deposit by the Boudouard reaction (4)."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation discussed in this paper is carbon deposition or coking on the catalyst surface. This is particularly noted for Ga2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

Regarding regeneration methods, the paper only discusses the use of CO2 for regeneration. It suggests that CO2 can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. However, the effectiveness of this method appears limited, as the amount of CO produced (indicating carbon removal) decreased with increasing pulse number.

The paper does not provide information on reoxidation with air or O2, nor does it discuss temperature requirements for regeneration or the impact on catalytic performance in detail. It also does not mention Cr-based or VOx catalysts specifically, or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The study focuses primarily on Ga2O3 catalysts and does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer all aspects of the question, particularly regarding other catalyst types and regeneration methods.

本文讨论的金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面的碳沉积或结焦。这一点在丙烷脱氢反应中的Ga2O3催化剂上尤为明显。

关于再生方法，本文仅讨论了使用CO2进行再生。文章提出CO2可以通过Boudouard反应去除碳沉积。然而，这种方法的有效性似乎有限，因为随着脉冲次数的增加，产生的CO量（表示碳去除）减少。

文章没有提供关于使用空气或O2进行再氧化的信息，也没有详细讨论再生的温度要求或对催化性能的影响。它也没有特别提到基于Cr或VOx的催化剂，或CO2添加对减少VOx催化反应过度氧化的潜在作用。

这项研究主要集中在Ga2O3催化剂上，没有提供全面的信息来完整回答问题的所有方面，特别是关于其他类型的催化剂和再生方法。
