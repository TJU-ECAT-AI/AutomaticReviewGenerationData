[1] "Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]."

[2] "TGA analysis showed 3% increase in the mass of the Ga2O3 catalyst after 4 h reaction period. These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "Pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the initial yield of hydrocarbon products during the reaction in a stream of carbon dioxide or argon. Fig. 2 shows the propane conversion and the yield of hydrocarbon products as a function of pulse number. The propene yield and the total yield of hydrocarbons (C1C3) in the presence of carbon dioxide are higher than those in argon atmosphere."

[4] "The carbon deposition is one of the major problems in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3. Coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of acid sites on the catalyst."

The literature focuses on Ga2O3 catalysts rather than Cr-based or VOx catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. However, some insights can be drawn:

The primary cause of catalyst deactivation mentioned is carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. This occurs rapidly, with significant deactivation observed after just 1 hour of reaction time.

Regarding regeneration methods, the paper does not directly compare different approaches. However, it does mention that CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction, despite showing some initial promoting effects.

The effectiveness of CO2 appears limited. While it enhances initial activity and yield compared to an inert atmosphere (argon), it does not prevent rapid deactivation due to coking.

Temperature plays a significant role, with higher temperatures accelerating coke formation. The paper does not discuss specific temperature requirements for regeneration.

The study does not directly address the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, it does show that CO2 can act as a mild oxidant, which could potentially be relevant to VOx systems, though this would require further investigation.

Overall, while the paper provides some insights into deactivation and the role of CO2, it does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding Cr-based and VOx catalysts or detailed comparisons of regeneration methods.

这篇文献主要关注Ga2O3催化剂，而不是Cr基或VOx催化剂的氧化脱氢。然而，我们可以得出一些见解：

文中提到的催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面的碳沉积。这种现象发生得很快，在反应1小时后就观察到显著的失活。

关于再生方法，该文章并未直接比较不同的方法。但是，它确实提到尽管CO2在初期显示了一些促进作用，但在反应过程中并不能抑制催化剂的快速失活。

CO2的有效性似乎有限。虽然与惰性气氛（氩气）相比，它能提高初始活性和产率，但无法防止由于结焦导致的快速失活。

温度起着重要作用，较高的温度会加速焦炭形成。文章没有讨论再生所需的具体温度要求。

这项研究没有直接讨论CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在缓解作用。然而，它确实表明CO2可以作为一种温和的氧化剂，这可能与VOx系统有关，但这需要进一步研究。

总的来说，虽然这篇文章提供了一些关于失活和CO2作用的见解，但并没有全面地涉及问题的所有方面，特别是关于Cr基和VOx催化剂或再生方法的详细比较。
