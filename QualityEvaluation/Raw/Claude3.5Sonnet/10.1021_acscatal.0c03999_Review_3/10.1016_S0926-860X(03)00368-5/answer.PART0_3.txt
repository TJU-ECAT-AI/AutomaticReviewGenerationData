[1] "Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]."

[2] "TGA analysis showed 3% increase in the mass of the Ga2O3 catalyst after 4 h reaction period. These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "The carbon deposition is one of the major problems in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3. Coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of acid sites on the catalyst."

[4] "Pulse reaction study was performed for better understanding of the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane. Before reaction, samples of the fresh catalysts were reduced by a pulse of hydrogen or propane."

[5] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide. However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number. These results suggest that CO2 can remove the carbon deposit by the Boudouard reaction (4)."

The literature does not specifically discuss Cr-based or VOx catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. However, based on the information provided about Ga2O3 catalysts, we can infer some general insights about catalyst deactivation and regeneration in dehydrogenation processes:

1. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation appears to be carbon deposition (coking) on the catalyst surface. This is exacerbated by high temperatures and the presence of acid sites on the catalyst.

2. The literature does not compare various regeneration methods in detail. However, it does mention that CO2 can potentially remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. This suggests that CO2 could be used as a regeneration agent, though its effectiveness may be limited.

3. The addition of CO2 to the reaction atmosphere does not significantly suppress catalyst deactivation during continuous operation. However, pulse reaction studies indicate that CO2 can remove some carbon deposits, suggesting it may have a role in periodic regeneration.

4. The literature does not provide information on temperature requirements for regeneration or the impact of different regeneration methods on catalytic performance.

5. There is no specific information provided about the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

It's important to note that these insights are primarily based on studies of Ga2O3 catalysts and may not be directly applicable to Cr-based or VOx catalysts without further research.

该文献并未具体讨论氧化脱氢反应中的铬基或钒氧化物催化剂。然而，根据提供的关于Ga2O3催化剂的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于脱氢过程中催化剂失活和再生的一般见解：

1. 催化剂失活的主要原因似乎是催化剂表面的碳沉积（结焦）。高温和催化剂上酸性位点的存在会加剧这一问题。

2. 该文献并未详细比较各种再生方法。但是，它确实提到CO2可能通过Boudouard反应去除碳沉积。这表明CO2可能被用作再生剂，尽管其效果可能有限。

3. 在反应气氛中添加CO2并不能显著抑制连续操作过程中的催化剂失活。然而，脉冲反应研究表明CO2可以去除一些碳沉积，这说明它可能在周期性再生中发挥作用。

4. 该文献没有提供关于再生所需温度或不同再生方法对催化性能影响的信息。

5. 没有提供关于CO2添加减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜力的具体信息。

需要注意的是，这些见解主要基于Ga2O3催化剂的研究，如果不进行进一步研究，可能无法直接应用于铬基或钒氧化物催化剂。
