What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

[1] "Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]."

[2] "TGA analysis showed 3% increase in the mass of the Ga2O3 catalyst after 4 h reaction period. These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "The carbon deposition is one of the major problems in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3. Coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of acid sites on the catalyst."

[4] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide. However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number. These results suggest that CO2 can remove the carbon deposit by the Boudouard reaction (4)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation discussed in this literature is carbon deposition or coking on the catalyst surface. This is particularly observed for Ga2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature only discusses the use of CO2 for regeneration. It suggests that CO2 can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. However, the effectiveness of this method appears limited, as the amount of CO produced (indicating carbon removal) decreases with repeated pulses of CO2.

The literature does not provide information on regeneration using air or O2, nor does it compare different regeneration methods in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation is not directly addressed for VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the study shows that for Ga2O3 catalysts, CO2 enhances initial activity but does not prevent rapid deactivation due to coking.

It's important to note that this literature focuses primarily on Ga2O3 catalysts rather than Cr-based or VOx catalysts, so the information may not be directly applicable to those systems.

这篇文献讨论的金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面的碳沉积或结焦。这种现象在丙烷脱氢反应中的Ga2O3催化剂上特别明显。

关于再生方法，文献只讨论了使用CO2进行再生。它表明CO2可以通过Boudouard反应去除碳沉积物。然而，这种方法的效果似乎有限，因为随着重复使用CO2脉冲，产生的CO量（表示碳的去除）逐渐减少。

文献没有提供使用空气或O2进行再生的信息，也没有比较不同再生方法在有效性、温度要求或对催化性能影响方面的差异。

文献没有直接讨论CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的缓解潜力。然而，研究表明，对于Ga2O3催化剂，CO2确实增强了初始活性，但无法防止由于结焦导致的快速失活。

需要注意的是，这篇文献主要关注Ga2O3催化剂，而不是基于Cr或VOx的催化剂，因此这些信息可能不直接适用于那些体系。

Fig. 2 shows the propane conversion and the yield of hydrocarbon products as a function of pulse number. The propene yield and the total yield of hydrocarbons (C1C3) in the presence of carbon dioxide are higher than those in argon atmosphere."

The literature focuses on Ga2O3 catalysts rather than Cr-based or VOx catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. However, some insights can be drawn:

The primary cause of catalyst deactivation mentioned is carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. This occurs rapidly, with significant deactivation observed after just 1 hour of reaction time.

Regarding regeneration methods, the paper does not directly compare different approaches. However, it does mention that CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction, despite showing some initial promoting effects.

The effectiveness of CO2 appears limited. While it enhances initial activity and yield compared to an inert atmosphere (argon), it does not prevent rapid deactivation due to coking.

Temperature plays a significant role, with higher temperatures accelerating coke formation. The paper does not discuss specific temperature requirements for regeneration.

The study does not directly address the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, it does show that CO2 can act as a mild oxidant, which could potentially be relevant to VOx systems, though this would require further investigation.

Overall, while the paper provides some insights into deactivation and the role of CO2, it does not comprehensively address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding Cr-based and VOx catalysts or detailed comparisons of regeneration methods.

这篇文献主要关注Ga2O3催化剂，而不是Cr基或VOx催化剂的氧化脱氢。然而，我们可以得出一些见解：

文中提到的催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面的碳沉积。这种现象发生得很快，在反应1小时后就观察到显著的失活。

关于再生方法，该文章并未直接比较不同的方法。但是，它确实提到尽管CO2在初期显示了一些促进作用，但在反应过程中并不能抑制催化剂的快速失活。

CO2的有效性似乎有限。虽然与惰性气氛（氩气）相比，它能提高初始活性和产率，但无法防止由于结焦导致的快速失活。

温度起着重要作用，较高的温度会加速焦炭形成。文章没有讨论再生所需的具体温度要求。

这项研究没有直接讨论CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在缓解作用。然而，它确实表明CO2可以作为一种温和的氧化剂，这可能与VOx系统有关，但这需要进一步研究。

总的来说，虽然这篇文章提供了一些关于失活和CO2作用的见解，但并没有全面地涉及问题的所有方面，特别是关于Cr基和VOx催化剂或再生方法的详细比较。

The literature does not specifically discuss Cr-based or VOx catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. However, based on the information provided about Ga2O3 catalysts, we can infer some general insights about catalyst deactivation and regeneration in dehydrogenation processes:

1. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation appears to be carbon deposition (coking) on the catalyst surface. This is exacerbated by high temperatures and the presence of acid sites on the catalyst.

2. The literature does not compare various regeneration methods in detail. However, it does mention that CO2 can potentially remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. This suggests that CO2 could be used as a regeneration agent, though its effectiveness may be limited.

3. The addition of CO2 to the reaction atmosphere does not significantly suppress catalyst deactivation during continuous operation. However, pulse reaction studies indicate that CO2 can remove some carbon deposits, suggesting it may have a role in periodic regeneration.

4. The literature does not provide information on temperature requirements for regeneration or the impact of different regeneration methods on catalytic performance.

5. There is no specific information provided about the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

It's important to note that these insights are primarily based on studies of Ga2O3 catalysts and may not be directly applicable to Cr-based or VOx catalysts without further research.

该文献并未具体讨论氧化脱氢反应中的铬基或钒氧化物催化剂。然而，根据提供的关于Ga2O3催化剂的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于脱氢过程中催化剂失活和再生的一般见解：

1. 催化剂失活的主要原因似乎是催化剂表面的碳沉积（结焦）。高温和催化剂上酸性位点的存在会加剧这一问题。

2. 该文献并未详细比较各种再生方法。但是，它确实提到CO2可能通过Boudouard反应去除碳沉积。这表明CO2可能被用作再生剂，尽管其效果可能有限。

3. 在反应气氛中添加CO2并不能显著抑制连续操作过程中的催化剂失活。然而，脉冲反应研究表明CO2可以去除一些碳沉积，这说明它可能在周期性再生中发挥作用。

4. 该文献没有提供关于再生所需温度或不同再生方法对催化性能影响的信息。

5. 没有提供关于CO2添加减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜力的具体信息。

需要注意的是，这些见解主要基于Ga2O3催化剂的研究，如果不进行进一步研究，可能无法直接应用于铬基或钒氧化物催化剂。
