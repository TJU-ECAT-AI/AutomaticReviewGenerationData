Abstract
Diamond is a highly attractive material for photoelectrochemical applications such as dye-
sensitized solar cells or photocatalysis because of its high chemical stability, high conductivity upon 
doping and the ease by which synthetic diamond thin films or nanostructures can be grown on 
various substrates. For these applications in particular, a well-defined surface functionalization is a 
crucial, yet non-trivial matter. In the first part of this review we therefore provide an extensive 
overview of the surface chemistry of doped and intrinsic diamond thin films. Different techniques to 
alter the surface termination of freshly grown diamond electrodes are illustrated and compared. 
Next, the subsequent functionalization steps to form stable covalent bonds between (linker) 
molecules and the diamond surface are discussed, with special emphasis on photochemical and 
(electro)chemical diazonium grafting. Several strategies to fabricate macromolecular brushes via 
surface initiated and direct polymerization techniques are proposed as well. In the second part, the 
photocurrent generation of dye-sensitized boron-doped diamond electrodes is compared and the 
influence of the employed chromophores, functionalization strategy, surface contamination and 
doping concentrations is analyzed. To conclude, the emerging photocatalytic applications of diamond 
are highlighted, such as the reduction of carbon monoxide, ammonia synthesis and water splitting.

1. Introduction
Natural diamond is commonly known as a precious gemstone. However, as a result of the 
development of high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) diamond synthesis and chemical vapour 
deposition (CVD) techniques,1-4 synthetic diamond has gained significant scientific and economic 
importance. Both single crystal and polycrystalline diamond can be grown on multiple surfaces and 
the grain size can be controlled from ultranano- to nano- and microcrystalline dimensions.5 Polishing 
of these surfaces allows for the development of atomically flat diamond films,6 whereas reactive ion 
etching and CVD growth on patterned templates result in different diamond nanostructures such as 
vertically aligned nanowires,7 diamond foams,8, 9 fibres,10 etc. Moreover, the conductivity of 
diamond, which is an insulating material in se due to its wide bandgap of 5.47 eV, can be tuned by 
substituting carbon atoms in the crystal lattice with boron or nitrogen and phosphorus to obtain p-
type or n-type conductivity, respectively.11 At rather low doping levels ( 1019 atoms cm-3) diamond 
attains semiconducting properties, while higher doping levels (above 1020 atoms cm-3) result in a 
semi-metallic electrical behavior. In combination with diamonds unique intrinsic properties, i.e. an 
extreme hardness, high thermal conductivity, chemical inertness, broad potential window and 
biocompatibility, this has led to a broad range of applications. Boron-doped diamond (BDD) for 
example excels as an electrochemical material.12 It holds great promise for high power electronics13 
and photodetectors,14 and plays a major role in quantum technologies.15 Over the past 10 years, 
diamond has also been gaining more and more interest as a photocathode material for alternative p-
type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and for photocatalytic applications. Here, not only the bulk 
properties, but also the surface composition of diamond plays a crucial role in its success.  
Although diamond is always considered an inert material, a multitude of strategies have been 
developed to alter its surface. The surface termination of freshly grown diamond depends on the 
available molecules during the growth process, which is typically hydrogen. However, these 
hydrogen atoms can be replaced by other elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and even 
halogens by performing thermal, electrochemical or plasma treatments.16 Subsequently, the 
resulting surface termination can be exploited to covalently attach larger molecules such as light-
harvesting dyes, DNA or proteins. The most popular functionalization strategies involve 
photochemical or diazonium grafting of terminal alkenes and diazonium salts, respectively, on H-
terminated diamond.17 Accordingly, strong carbon-carbon bonds are formed between the surface 
and the target molecules. This results in a very robust interface that outperforms other 
semiconducting materials such as silicon, gold or glassy carbon in terms of stability. Oxygen- and 
nitrogen-terminated diamond are commonly employed as well for further functionalization via 
silanization, esterification or amidation reactions.18 Moreover, the functionalization of diamond is 
not limited to (bio)molecules, but larger macromolecular structures, including polymers, have also 
been successfully grafted onto the surface.
In this review we thoroughly discuss the surface chemistry of diamond thin films, while a recent 
book chapter by A. Krueger specifically deals with nanodiamonds.19 A complete and up to date 
overview of the different techniques employed for surface termination, functionalization and 
polymerization is provided. In contrast with a previous review from 2014,16 which focuses on the 
biological applications of functionalized diamond, we have paid special attention to the 
photoelectrochemical applications of these functional surfaces. This includes its application in p-type 
DSSCs and emerging photocatalytic applications such as CO2 reduction, ammonia synthesis, and 
water splitting.

2. Diamond Surface Chemistry
2.1.
Surface Termination
Under typical CVD growth conditions, the employed hydrogen gas plays an important role. It not 
only allows the synthesis of diamond through the generation of radicals on both the hydrocarbon 
source and the monocrystalline or nanodiamond substrate, it also etches away sp2-hybridized carbon 
(graphite) at a much higher rate than it does for sp3-hybridized carbon (diamond), resulting in high 
quality diamond films. The employed hydrogen gas stabilizes the dangling bonds at the diamond 
surface, resulting in H-termination. This H-termination gives rise to some of diamonds unique 
properties, such as its high chemical inertness, large potential window and negative electron affinity 
(NEA), which results in a p-type surface conductivity after surface transfer doping, even in undoped 
diamond films.20 Although H-terminated diamond has a high stability and hence a low surface 
reactivity, the H-termination will gradually deteriorate when used repeatedly in an electrochemical 
setup or exposed to air for a prolonged period of time. The most convenient ways of restoring this 
hydrogen surface termination is by subjecting diamond to a hydrogen plasma or performing an 
electrochemical cathodic treatment.21, 22 The latter method has the advantage of being non-
destructive, which can be advantageous when ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD)  having a 
higher sp2-carbon content that would be etched away by a hydrogen plasma  is being employed.23 
Also, it has been demonstrated that plasma treatment can lead to microscopic inhomogenities in the 
form of non-diamond carbon of 1 nm thickness at the surface.24 Recently, Kasahara et al. have 
elucidated the mechanism for the hydrogenation of diamond electrodes via cathodic treatment and 
they demonstrated that a faster and more efficient H-termination can be achieved when lower 
potentials (-5.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) are applied in strongly acidic electrolyte solutions (pH = 0.9).25 
The H-terminated diamond surface can also be deliberately oxidized to form hydroxyl (C-OH), 
ether (C-O-C), carbonyl (C=O) and carboxylic acid (COOH) functional groups, drastically changing the 
surface properties. O-terminated diamonds are hydrophilic materials that demonstrate a good 
biocompatibility.26 The p-type surface conductivity is lost since O-terminated diamond electrodes 
have a positive electron affinity (PEA). Moreover, due to the possibility of forming H-bonds with 
other molecules, the electrochemical properties (i.e. electron transfer kinetics and potential window) 
are altered. Surface oxidation of diamond has been achieved through a variety of techniques, 
including (i) thermal oxidation,27-29 (ii) hot filament cracking to produce O2•,30 (iii) reaction of Cl-
terminated diamond with H2O,31 (iv) chemical treatment by boiling in sulfochromic acid or piranha,32, 
33 (v) oxygen plasma treatment,34, 35 (vi) photochemical oxidation,36, 37 (vii) UV-ozone treatment,33, 38, 39 
and (viii) anodic electrochemical polarization.40-42 The various approaches result in different surface 
compositions, which have been extensively studied by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution electron loss spectroscopy (HREELS). 
Oxidation with thermally activated oxygen results in surfaces that mainly contain C-OH and C=O 
groups in the early stages, whereas fully oxidized surfaces are dominated by C-O-C groups.28, 30 
Thermal treatment is also beneficial for the quality of diamond as this reduces the quantity of non-
diamond carbon in thin films.43 However, heating above 600 C leads to surface defects.44 For 
samples treated with UV/ozone, a similar trend in the surface termination was observed, with C-OH 
groups dominating for short treatments while longer treatments result in a high amount of C-O-C 
groups.  Oxygen plasma on the other hand is an extremely fast technique and after only 2 minutes, 
the surface is completely covered with C-O-C groups. The harsh conditions employed for plasma 
treatment also lead to a certain amount of undesired graphitization.40, 45 Analysis of diamond 
electrodes oxidized through anodic electrochemical polarization provided somewhat contradicting

results. Notsu et al. demonstrated that after applying a constant potential of 2.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 
M KOH for 1 hour, the majority of the oxygen groups were C=O species,40, 46 which was later 
supported by HREELS measurements.44 Conversely, Wang et al. reported that electrochemically 
oxidized surfaces contain high amounts of C-OH functionalities, which they confirmed through 
esterification of the surface alcohol groups with trifluoroacetic acid.47 These results were rationalized 
by the fact that high amounts of OH radicals are formed near the diamond surface during the 
electrochemical treatment. More recently, the importance of the employed potential during the 
anodic polarization was pointed out. Electrochemical oxidation occurs starting from potentials higher 
than 1.6 V vs. Ag/Ag2SO4, with primarily C-OH functionalities being formed. Formation of C=O and C-
O-C only happens at higher potentials above 2.1 V (Figure 1),48 which explains the difference 
between previous results. A similar dependence on the employed potential was also observed by 
Nakamura and co.49 Generally, it can be stated that for the discussed techniques, except for plasma 
treatment, the surface oxygen species can be tuned depending on the conditions. It should also be 
mentioned that there are differences between single crystal and polycrystalline diamond and the 
local heterogeneities at different doping level play a significant role as well.32, 48 Therefore, it is 
imperative that the employed conditions and substrate specifications are reported precisely for 
reproducibility purposes.50

between -1.8 V and + 0.5, + 1.6 and + 2.5 V vs Ag/Ag2SO4, respectively. At a potential of + 0.5 V, only 
a small amount of C-OH groups are formed. After the threshold value of 1.6 V, the C-OH 
concentration increases, together with the formation of carbonyl groups. At potentials above 2.5 V, 
the majority of surface oxygen species are ether groups. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright

Several methods have also been developed to introduce N-termination on diamond since these 
surfaces proved to be ideal platforms for the attachment of biomolecules such as DNA and 
peptides.51, 52 Moreover, N-termination can improve quantum-sensing applications by increasing the 
spin coherence time of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers.53 N-terminated diamond is hydrophilic and 
shows exceptional properties with regards to electron affinity. When the surface is covered by 
primary amine groups (C-NH2), a NEA is obtained.54 However, if more secondary amines (C-NH-C, 
C=NH) or hydrazine-like (C-NH-NH-C) structures are present, which fully terminate the surface, a 
PEA is observed.55, 56 N-termination of diamond can be achieved through a two-step procedure by 
thermal or photochemical amination of Cl-terminated surfaces,31, 57, 58 or directly via photochemical

amination in liquid ammonia,65-67 and irradiation with a N2/H2 radical beam.68 Although these 
different methods result in a combination of primary and secondary amine surface groups, XPS 
analysis showed that the electrochemical amination results in higher amounts (40%) of secondary 
amines (C=NH and C-NH-C), whereas for samples aminated via plasma treatments over 95% of 
primary amine groups can be obtained (Figure 2).69, 70 Incorporation of small amounts of oxygen

S-termination of diamond thin films was first investigated by Nakamura et al. via the photolysis of 
cyclic disulfides with UV light.72 Analysis of the C1s signal in XPS revealed the formation of two new 
carbon moieties, i.e. thioethers (C-S-C) and thiols (C-SH). Mechanistically, this means that after 
photolysis of the cyclic disulfide, one end of the generated radical dithiol grafts itself onto the 
surface, while the other end remains in contact with the solution, resulting in the formation of a 
thioalkylthiol layer as shown in Figure 3. To avoid the synthesis of these cyclic disulfides, a similar 
procedure was employed using elementary sulfur (S8).73, 74 Here, the photolysis of S8 is followed by 
the grafting of a polythiol (-Sx-) on the surface. Under continuous irradiation, this is further 
photolysed leading to S-terminated diamond. FTIR and XPS analysis demonstrated that both C-SH 
and thiocarbonyl groups are present (C=S). The resulting surfaces were then employed for the 
construction of self-assembled monolayers with gold nanoparticles.

Apart from the conventional H-, O-, N- and the somewhat more exotic S-terminated surfaces, 
halogenation of diamond has been thoroughly investigated as well and this already starting from 
1967.75 Development of F-terminated diamond has received special attention as this drastically 
improved the (oxidative) stability at elevated temperatures and the lubrication properties. 
Fluorinated BDD electrodes are the only electrode materials to date that have an electrochemical 
potential window spanning 5 V.76 This can be explained by the low interaction between adsorbed 
intermediates and the fluorinated electrode as a result of its polar hydrophobicity.77 Termination of 
the diamond surface with fluorine has been achieved through treating diamond powder or films with 
molecular fluorine (F2),75 atomic fluorine (F•) beams,78 or plasma treatment with SF6,79, 80 CF4,81-83 or 
CHF3.84 However, despite the atomic radius of F (1.4 Å) being only slightly larger than that of H (1.2 
Å), a surface termination of only 60% could be obtained.85 Therefore, Smetkowksi et al. developed a 
novel fluorination strategy through irradiation of perfluorinated butyl iodides (C4F9I) with X-rays.86 
This generates the corresponding radical C4F9•, which can attach onto a H-terminated diamond 
surface. The functionalized surfaces were then heated to 300 K to remove any non-reacted C4F9I, 
which resulted in a surface fluorine to carbon ratio of 2. Further increasing the temperature up to 
800 K led to a thermal decomposition of the diamond-C4F9 interface to one with simple C-F bonds, as 
shown in Figure 4. This was accompanied by a decrease of the surface F to C ratio to a value of 0.6, 
which is a similar fluorine coverage as produced by the techniques described above.87 Small 
variations on the perfluorination of diamond were performed through photolysis of perfluoroalkyl 
iodides with UV light,88 by employing perfluoroazoalkanes (as they also readily decompose into 
radicals upon illumination)89, 90 or through electrochemical oxidation of perfluoroalkyl acids.91

Figure 4  Diamond surface fluorination by employing molecular fluorine (F2), atomic fluorine (F•) 
beams, plasma treatment or a perfluorination method.
In addition to fluorine, also Cl-terminated diamond surfaces have been prepared through various 
methods (Figure 5). Initially, rather harsh and corrosive reaction conditions were employed, e.g. 
guiding a Cl2 gas stream over diamond powder at 400 C75 or generation of atomic chlorine in a 
microwave reactor at 300 C.31 A milder route towards chlorination of diamond was first reported by 
Miller and Brown and employs irradiation of diamond powders or single crystals with a high-pressure 
Hg arc lamp to photochemically dissociate Cl2.57 There are also some reports on the preparation of 
Cl-terminated diamond surfaces via two wet-chemical approaches: (i) Heating diamond in a solution 
of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and chloroform at 50 C in the presence of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), 
which serves as a radical initiator;92-94 (ii) Refluxing diamond in a solution of N-chlorosuccinimide 
(NCS) and tetrachloromethane (CCl4) in the presence of benzoylperoxide as radical initiator.95 Cl-
terminated surfaces demonstrated a lower stability compared to F-terminated diamond. Exposure of 
these chlorinated surfaces to water or air resulted in partial hydrolysis of the C-Cl bonds, which 
decreased the surface termination from 50% to only 5%.31, 82 Yet, this higher reactivity of the Cl-
terminated surfaces can be beneficial as this resulted in one of the first methods to develop NH2-
terminated surfaces31, 57, 58 and enables direct functionalization of diamond with pyridinium salts96 
and n-, sec- or tert-butyl groups (Figure 5).92, 93

Br-termination of diamond has received much less attention. The first report dates from 1968, 
wherein a stream of Br2 gas was guided over a diamond powder at 100 C.75 However, only very small 
amounts of bromine were actually bound to the surface. Similarly, a chemical approach in which 
diamond was heated in a solution of Br2 and chloroform at 50 C with AIBN as radical initiator 
resulted in poor Br-termination.92 Wang et al. obtained a Br/C ratio of 0.15 after bromine 
termination of diamond by refluxing the sample in a mixture of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and CCl4. 
Afterwards, alkylation was attempted through reaction with the Grignard reagent of 1-bromodecane. 
However, again a low grafting density was observed (Figure 5).95 The poor Br-termination is 
explained by a sterical effect due to the increased size of the atomic radius of bromine compared to 
chlorine and fluorine.97 Bromine is also a better leaving group, which facilitates hydrolysis of the C-Br

bonds at the surface. Due to its even larger atomic radius, I-termination of diamond has not been 
reported to date. 
2.2.
Surface Functionalization
From the above we can conclude that the diamond surface can be readily terminated with 
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and halogen atoms through a broad range of dry and wet 
chemical approaches. The different terminations can be employed to directly attach molecules to the 
diamond surface. However, high loadings are hard to achieve. The stability of certain surface 
terminations is also questionable. Therefore, it is advisable to first covalently attach linker molecules 
to the diamond surface that in a subsequent reaction can be employed to immobilize larger 
molecules. The covalent attachment of these linkers will be discussed in the following paragraphs.  
2.2.1. Functionalization of H-terminated Diamond
2.2.1.1. Photochemical Functionalization 
Photochemical functionalization techniques have not only been employed to obtain oxygen-, 
amine- and halogen-terminated diamond, but the formation of actual C-C bonds between organic 
linker molecules and the surface has been addressed as well. This method, which was first employed 
for the functionalization of H-terminated Si (Si-H) surfaces, was translated to diamond by Hamers 
and co. in 2002.98 Practically, H-terminated diamond is covered with a thin layer of liquid alkenes and 
subsequently irradiated with UV light of 254 nm to form a self-terminating monolayer. The influence 
of the functionalization time was carefully investigated and after 1.5 hours of UV irradiation, a rough 
surface was obtained indicating the formation of a sub-monolayer. For longer irradiation times 
between 10 and 12 hours, the surface roughness decreased and a complete 2D monolayer was 
obtained. Further increasing the reaction time lead to the formation of a thick 3D multilayer through 
cross-polymerization via the alkene functionalities.99, 100 The reaction time can eventually be 
decreased to  4 hours by applying a negative potential during the functionalization. Nevertheless, 
this does not change the density of the formed monolayers.101 The employed organic molecules 
typically comprise a terminal alkene and a protected functional moiety that can be utilized for 
attaching different molecules to the surface. Protection of the functional head group is necessary for 
functionalization of Si-H surfaces to prevent etching of the topmost layer. Yet, for diamond this is not 
required due to its intrinsic stability.102 Employing this technique, diamond has been functionalized 
with a large variety of short and long alkenes bearing (protected) amines,103-109 carboxylic acids,26, 102, 
110-113 ethers,114, 115 alcohols,116-118 thiols,119, 120 or more exotic functional groups such as perfluorinated 
alkanes,121 ferrocene,122 pyridine123 and phosphoric acids.124 Nevertheless, the applicability of these 
alkenes is limited in a sense that they are not allowed to absorb light with wavelengths around 254 
nm, as this would interfere with the functionalization mechanism. An overview of the alkenes that 
have been employed so far is presented in Figure 6. Amines and carboxylic acids are most frequently 
encountered as these types of surfaces present an ideal platform to design biosensors via 
attachment of either DNA or proteins via EDC/NHS coupling reactions.114, 125-128 Mixed molecular 
monolayers can be developed as well. By introducing ethylene glycol functionalized alkenes for 
example, non-specific binding of proteins can be drastically decreased.129 Patterned surfaces with a 
resolution of 1 m can also be obtained by employing a mask to shield certain parts of the surface 
during irradiation.130 
The mechanism of the photochemical diamond functionalization has been the subject of several 
studies, but it was only 8 years after the development of this technique that it was completely

elucidated.101, 104, 131 For a long time it was thought that upon illumination with UV light, electrons 
were excited from the valence band of H-terminated diamond to its conduction band, and then 
ejected into the liquid alkene film. However, the electrons are actually directly excited into the liquid 
and more exactly in the functionalized head group, since alkenes with stronger electron withdrawing 
groups are grafted more efficiently.129, 132 After electron ejection, a positively charged hole stays 
behind on the diamond surface, which undergoes a nucleophilic attack by the terminal alkene. The 
resulting positive charge on the grafted alkane will abstract a proton from diamond which can then 
undergo a nucleophilic attack by the next alkene molecule. A schematic illustration of this 
mechanism is depicted in Figure 6.

2.2.1.2. Diazonium Grafting
Besides photochemical functionalization, grafting of aryl diazonium salts can also be employed to 
construct stable C-C bonds between the diamond surface and aromatic organic molecules. This 
method was first demonstrated by Swain and co. in 1999 and it holds considerable advantages over 
the photochemical method.133 Diazonium grafting is mostly performed electrochemically, by 
submerging a BDD electrode in a solution of the diazonium salt and cycling to negative potentials.134 
By doing so, electrons are ejected from the diamond electrode, resulting in the generation of aryl 
radicals near the surface and their subsequent grafting. This functionalization proceeds very rapidly 
as the reduction peak decreases drastically after only one cycle, indicating passivation of the

diamond (Figure 7).135 Compared to the photochemical method, diazonium grafting was calculated to 
form denser and stronger molecular layers due to π-π stacking between the aromatic molecules.136 
This was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) scratching experiments. Removal of a 
diazonium grafted layer required almost the double amount of force compared to a photochemically 
functionalized one.128, 137 The delocalization of electrons in these aryl linkers also increases the 
applicability of diamond electrodes in organic electronics because of the improved charge transfer in 
fully conjugated systems.138 Patterning is also possible via electrospotting.139 Moreover, a large 
amount of aryl diazonium salts are commercially available or they can easily be prepared (in situ) 
from the corresponding amines through diazotization with NaNO2 or tert-butyl nitrite.138, 140-142

grafting mechanism. b. Overview of commonly employed aryl diazonium salts. c. Cyclic 
voltammogram for the electrochemical reduction of an aryl diazonium salt, with a typical sharp 
reduction peak in the first scan that disappears in subsequent cycles. 
Nevertheless, functionalization via electrochemical diazonium grafting also suffers from a few 
drawbacks. First of all, this strategy requires an electrically conductive substrate, so it is not 
applicable for undoped diamond. Also, if the reduction potential is set too negative, the aryl radical 
will be further reduced to the corresponding anion and the grafting efficiency will be limited.143 The 
biggest disadvantage, however, is the lack of control and strong tendency to form multilayers due to 
attack of radicals on the already grafted layer.134, 135, 144 Since the amount of generated radicals is 
directly related to the charge passed through the electrode, controlling the amount of charges could 
suppress multilayer formation. Indeed, by briefly (a few seconds) applying a constant potential, 
which is just below the redox potential of the diazonium salt, an actual monolayer of nitrophenyl 
molecules (0.8 nm) could be formed.145 Increasing the time to 600 seconds resulted in the formation 
of a thin multilayer (2.1 nm), whereas the cycling potential method gave rise to rather thick layers 
(7.6 nm).146 A different approach to limit the charge passing through the diamond electrode is 
lowering the (boron) doping concentration, which was successfully applied to construct a compact 
monolayer.147 In case of H-terminated diamond, which has a p-type surface conductivity due to its 
NEA, spontaneous diazonium grafting was demonstrated as well. This method was performed by

simply submerging the diamond sample in a solution of the diazonium salt in acetonitrile,148 ionic 
liquids,149 or an acidic aqueous solution for reaction times up to 2 hours.138 After grafting an initial 
surface layer, the p-type conductivity is lost, making the reaction self-limiting to a monolayer. This 
method is extremely simple since no electrochemical setup is required and it has the advantage that 
intrinsic diamond can be functionalized as well. On the other hand, Leroux et al. demonstrated that 
employing diazonium salts with bulky functional groups, such as triisopropylsilyl protected ethynyls, 
could prevent multilayer formation as the ortho position is sterically shielded.150 Decreasing the size 
of the protecting group from triisopropyl- to triethyl- and trimethylsilyl was used to increase the 
density of the monolayer.151 A final technique to obtain monolayers is the addition of molecules such 
as 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl. Its electro-reduced species controls the formation of reactive aryl 
radicals through a redox reaction with the corresponding diazonium salt.152 
Via this grafting method, be it electrochemical or spontaneous, a broad range of functional groups 
have been attached on the diamond surface, the majority being nitro moieties. They are easily 
reduced to amines, which are mostly employed for the development of amperometric sensors 
through attachment of DNA153-155 or proteins.156, 157 Aryl diazonium salts bearing carboxylic acids,158 
azides,159, 160 alkynes,161-163 halogens138, 140, 164 and boronic acids141, 165, 166 are also frequently 
encountered (Figure 7) since they allow further functionalization via copper(I) azide-alkyne 
cycloaddition (CuAAC) or Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Lastly, some larger conjugated 
molecules such as anthraquinones,167 ruthenium dyes,168 biphenyls,142, 148, 169 or nanobodies were 
directly attached to diamond electrodes as well.170
2.2.2. Functionalization of O-terminated Diamond
Application of oxygen-terminated diamond surfaces for further functionalization has also received 
a considerable amount of attention. Although the various oxidation techniques provide surfaces that 
comprise alcohol, ether, carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups, the large majority of further 
functionalization approaches focus on the OH-functionalities on diamond. The most frequently 
employed protocols involve silanization, esterification and thermal alkylation. 
2.2.2.1. Silanization
Initially, silanization of OH-terminated diamond surfaces was merely performed to confirm the 
presence of the alcohol groups after surface oxidation, as their XPS signal is indistinguishable from 
that of ethers. This was first demonstrated by Notsu et al. in 2001 by immersing the BDD samples in 
an ethanol solution containing 2% of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) for 2 hours at room 
temperature.171 Their grafting was confirmed through an increased water contact angle and 
improved charge transfer kinetics with the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox couple due to attractive electrostatic 
interaction with the positively charge amine. The amine groups on these APTES layers were also 
employed to anchor biomolecules via the construction of α-oxo-semicarbazide bonds or a 
photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl linker, as illustrated in Figure 8.172, 173 Similarly, Boukherroub et al. 
functionalized a photochemically oxidized diamond surface with perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (PFDS) 
to prove the formation of OH moieties.37 Functionalization of diamond nanograss arrays with these 
PFDS molecules resulted in super hydrophobic surfaces.174 More recently, it was demonstrated that 
the presence of PFDS molecules strongly suppresses the formation of perchlorate ions during the 
electrochemical oxidation of organic molecules in NaCl and NaClO3 containing electrolyte solutions.91 
Functionalization of diamond with aromatic molecules such as N-(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)pyrrole 
(TMPP)175 and p-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane was also performed.36 The lower stability of the Si-O

sensitive o-nitrophenyl linker. Electrochemical impedance spectra show that after irradiation (black) 
of diamond nanowires functionalized with lysozyme (blue), the Nyquist plot is identical to the one 
before anchoring of the biomolecules (green). This demonstrates that illumination with light of 365 
nm for 20 min is sufficient to completely release all attached molecules. [Reprinted with permission,

2.2.2.2. Esterification
Esterification reactions employing the OH-groups on oxidized diamond surfaces can be performed 
in multiple ways. The most common method involves a direct reaction of the surface alcohol groups 
with a DCC or EDC/NHS activated carboxylic acid. As such, diamond has been functionalized with 
biotin,177 pyrene,178 and benzophenone.179 These benzophenone-decorated surfaces allow for some 
interesting chemistry. They are stable under standard conditions, but upon irradiation with light of 
365 nm, a diradical species is generated. These radicals can then react with sterically available C-H 
bonds to anchor biomolecules while retaining their activity.180 Diamond has also been functionalized 
with ionic liquids, which allows for a simple modification of the surface properties and mainly the 
wettability by exchanging the counter ions.181 Reactions with 4-azidobenzoic acids have also been 
performed and the resulting azide groups were employed for further functionalization via click 
chemistry, with efficiencies up to 53%.182, 183 A different way to functionalize the diamond surface is 
to perform an esterification reaction with linkers such as adipoyl chloride or succinic anhydride.184, 185 
The resulting carboxylic acid or acid chloride terminated surface then allows for further reactions. 
However, for this purpose, the COOH groups which are formed after the oxidation process can also 
be employed directly.186, 187 Finally, also two techniques were developed for the formation of 
phosphoester bonds. In the first method, the OH-groups are reacted with phosphorus oxychloride to 
form a diamond-O-POCl2 interface. Next, zirconoyl chloride is added, resulting in the oxidation to 
phosphoric acids, which immediately form a coordination bond with the present Zr4+ ions. After this

zirconation step, carboxylic acid bearing molecules can be anchored to the surface, as shown in 
Figure 9.188 In the other method, phosphoester bonds were formed by submerging an OH-terminated 
diamond sample in a solution of 6-phosphonohexanoic acid. After evaporation of the solvent, the 
samples were annealed at 180 C for 20 hours to remove all physisorbed molecules and the 
procedure was repeated one more time to obtain a good surface coverage.189

2.2.2.3. Thermal Alkylation
The last method that has been applied for functionalization of oxygen-terminated diamond 
surfaces is thermal alkylation, wherein diamond is heated in a neat solution of octadecene for 3 
hours at 200 C.190 AFM scratching confirmed grafting of the alkene molecules. A layer with a 
thickness of 1.5  0.4 nm was observed, indicating that the octadecyl chains adopt a tilted 
orientation. H-terminated diamond was proven to be unaffected under these alkylation conditions. 
Thus, this technique can be readily employed to develop multifunctional surfaces through a 
combination of thermal alkylation and photochemical grafting of OH- and H-terminated diamond, 
respectively. 
2.2.3. Functionalization of N-terminated Diamond
Functionalization of N-terminated diamond surfaces is essentially very similar to that of OH-
termination. The primary amine groups can be employed to form amide bonds with molecules 
bearing activated carboxylic acid moieties. Both flexible and more rigid linkers with various reactive 
groups have been investigated. For example, bifunctional linkers such succinyl chloride and the 
activated esters of adipic, terephthalic and trimesic acid have been employed to obtain a layer of 
COOH functional groups on an initially NH2-terminated surface. Subsequently, different biomolecules 
such as DNA can be attached via EDC/NHS chemistry.58, 59 The advantage of this method over 
esterification is the improved stability of the interfacial amide bonds toward hydrolysis. Peptide 
chains and fluorescein dyes were also attached through the formation of an α-oxo-semicarbazide

bond or reaction with sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate and 
subsequent Michael-addition.52, 62 Moreover, introduction of alkynes through amide bond formation 
with 4-pentynoic acid allowed the development of catalyst free thiol-yne reactions on diamond. The 
success of this method was addressed by coupling of perfluorinated and ferrocene functionalized 
thiol molecules, as this enables straightforward XPS and electrochemical analysis. Afterwards, DNA 
was also immobilized for the development of amperometric biosensors.191 Finally, NH2-terminated 
diamond surfaces can also be directly functionalized without using a linker molecule. However, this 
might result in a lower surface coverage due to sterical factors.68, 192 
2.3.
Surface Polymerization
Over the past decades, the discussed functionalization strategies of H-, O- and N-terminated 
diamond have been employed to covalently attach various (bio)molecules, which resulted in a broad 
range of applications. However, all these functionalization strategies suffer from the same drawback 
that only a limited amount of molecules can be attached. Even for diamond electrodes functionalized 
through electrochemical diazonium grafting, which has the tendency to form multilayers, sterical 
crowding will prevent a high surface coverage for subsequent coupling reactions. This issue can be 
overcome by functionalizing the surface with thicker polymer films that bear a multitude of reactive 
moieties. Typically, functionalization of surfaces with polymers can be performed in two different 
ways, i.e. via the grafting from and grafting onto strategy. For diamond, only surface initiated 
polymerizations and direct surface polymerizations, which are two variations on the grafting from 
approach, have been investigated so far.
2.3.1.
Surface initiated polymerization 
In the case of surface initiated polymerizations, a macro-initiated surface has to be prepared 
through functionalization of the diamond surface via conventional grafting procedures. This was first 
reported by Matrab et al. in 2006 for boron-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) by reaction 
with 4-(1-bromoethyl)benzenediazonium salts. The bromine groups then serve as an initiator for the 
atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of vinyl monomers such as styrene and methyl 
methacrylate in the presence of a Cu catalyst and a multidentate amine ligand.193 After 
polymerization of the poly(styrene) and poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer brushes, XPS analysis 
showed that a terminal Br group is still present, which is in line with the ATRP mechanism.194 UNCD 
was also functionalized with non-fouling poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate polymer brushes via 
ATRP on an α-bromoisobutyryl functionalized surface.195 In addition to controlled radical 
polymerizations, polymer-protein bioconjugate systems were developed via the free radical 
photopolymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate on benzophenone-terminated diamond (Figure 
10). The resulting OH-groups in the side chains of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) were employed to 
construct carbamate bonds with bovine serum albumin (BSA), which demonstrates specific 
interactions with anti-BSA.169 Other than radical polymerizations, Szunerits and co. have investigated 
the electropolymerization of O-terminated diamond surfaces that have been functionalized with 
pyrrole and thiophene units.175, 182 Electropolymerization was performed by submerging the 
functionalized electrodes in an aqueous electrolyte solution and cycling to oxidative potentials. Local 
polymerization resulting in polypyrrole dots between 1 and 250 m could be obtained via scanning 
electrochemical microscopy techniques.

2.3.2.
Direct surface polymerization 
Different from surface initiated polymerizations, direct surface polymerization does not require 
immobilization of an initiator on the diamond surface. The direct approaches that have been 
employed 
include 
electrochemical 
polymerization, 
self-initiated 
photografting 
and 
photopolymerization (SIPGP), and plasma polymerization. 
The electropolymerization of BDD thin films with a polyaniline/poly(acrylic acid) copolymer by Gu 
et al. in 2004 presented the very first report of diamond being covalently functionalized with a 
polymer.196 This specific copolymer was chosen since poly(acrylic acid) contains COOH groups, which 
can be used for the attachment of (bio)molecules, and polyaniline is a semiconducting material that 
improves charge transfer between the anchored molecules and the diamond electrode. Attachment 
of amino-functionalized single stranded DNA probes via EDC/NHS chemistry led to the development 
of an impedimetric sensor for DNA hybridization events. The detection limit was as low as 20 nM 
with a good selectivity between complementary and one-base mismatch targets, without detectable 
nonspecific 
interactions.197 
Another 
material 
that 
has 
been 
intensively 
studied 
for 
electropolymerization on diamond is pyrrole. Thick (25 nm) poly(pyrrole) films are readily obtained 
on both H- and O-terminated diamond from a 0.24 M aqueous pyrrole solution under galvanostatic 
conditions.198 Grafting of these poly(pyrrole) chains on nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) significantly 
changes both the photoluminescence properties and transport behavior of free charge carriers in the 
bulk diamond.199, 200 Pyrrole has also been polymerized in the presence of analytes such as 
theophylline and histamine for the development of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) on 
diamond. After polymerization, these analytes can be removed from the polymer matrix and a cavity 
remains. In this cavity, however, the orientation of the pyrrole units is ideal for rebinding the analyte 
molecules, which can be used to develop very specific impedimetric sensors.201, 202 A different kind of 
impedimetric sensor was developed by modifying diamond nanowires with a poly(3-carboxypyrrole) 
film. Depending on the charge that is passed through the diamond electrode, a different morphology 
is obtained. For a low deposition charge of 2 mC cm-2, polymer formation occurs only in between the

nanowires. When a high charge of 23 mC cm-2 is applied, the polymer film becomes too thick and the 
wire structure is lost. However, only when a moderate deposition charge of 11 mC cm-2 is employed, 
all nanowires are properly coated. The resulting COOH groups were employed to coordinate with 
divalent Cu2+ ions, which are further utilized for the binding of histidine-tagged peptides, as shown in 
Figure 11. The advantage of this functionalization approach is that the sensor is reusable since the 
complexes are easily disrupted using competing chelators.203 More recently, a hemin integrated 
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was electropolymerized from a solution containing 1.5 
mM hemin and 4.5 mM 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. The hemin groups are incorporated in the 
PEDOT structure via interactions between their carboxylic acid groups and the thiophene units, 
resulting in a cauliflower structure, which is related to 3D branched multi-globular films. The Fe 
atoms in these hemin groups allow for the electrochemical oxidation and detection of peroxynitrite 
with a sensitivity as low as 10 nM.204

polymerized on boron-doped nanowires, with Cu2+ at pH values above 6 and subsequent chelation of 
histidine-tagged peptides. [Reprinted with permission]203
Another way to easily prepare polymer brushes on diamond surfaces is the self-initiated 
photografting and photopolymerization or SIPGP of alkene-functionalized molecules. The first 
account of this SIPGP on diamond was reported by Steenackers et al. for the development of 
poly(styrene) brushes by simply submerging diamond substrates in freshly distilled styrene and 
irradiating the samples for 16 hours with light of 350 nm.205 Remarkably, no surface polymerization 
occurred on H-terminated diamond, whereas OH-terminated surfaces afforded 110 nm thick 
poly(styrene) brushes. This large difference is related to the SIPGP mechanism, where a proton is 
abstracted from the surface after photosensitization of the monomer. Since the bond dissociation 
energy for O-H bonds is lower than those of C-H bonds, the difference in surface polymerization 
behavior can be explained. The grafted poly(styrene) layers are extremely stable and vigorous 
reaction conditions can be employed to perform post-polymerization modifications toward 
poly(nitrostyrene) and poly(styrene sulfonic acids).  To further increase the structural complexity of 
the grafted polymers, a bifunctional 2-isoprenyl-2-oxazoline monomer was employed. The isoprenyl 
groups allow for the SIPGP of polymer brushes that contain oxazoline molecules, which hold the 
potential to be further polymerized via living cationic ring opening polymerization.206 To do so, an 
excess of methyl triflate was added to prepare a polycationic macroinitiator. Next, either 2-ethyl-2-

oxazoline or 2-carbazole-2-oxazoline monomers were added to prepare so-called polymer bottle-
brush brushes, as shown in Figure 12. Functionalization of these bottle-brush brushes is also possible 
by terminating the cationic ring opening polymerization with a glycine derivative of which the COOH 
group can be employed to attach biomolecules such as green fluorescent protein.207 In addition to 
oxazoline and styrene monomers, different acrylates such as methyl methacrylate, tert-butyl 
methacrylate and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate were grafted on diamond as well via SIPGP. 
After hydrolysis of the tert-butyl groups from poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) to poly(methacrylate), 
green fluorescent protein was attached to the carboxylic acid groups.207 The same functionalization 
strategy was also utilized to covalently attach cytochrome C and aminomethylferrocene.208

A final technique that has been employed for direct polymerization on H-terminated diamond 
thin films is the microwave pulsed-plasma polymerization of allylamine. These plasma polymer 
films display a strong adherence, good mechanical properties and high thermal resistance. 
However, the cross-linked poly(allylamine) film does not only contain primary amine groups, but also 
secondary amines, imines, cyanides and amides.209

3. Photoelectrochemical Applications
3.1.
(Dye-Sensitized) Solar Cells
3.1.1. Diamond-based active layers
Thanks to diamonds extraordinary properties and good (photo)electrochemical behavior, the 
material has received a considerable amount of attention for its application in photovoltaic devices. 
Initial experiments on photocurrent generation using either doped or undoped diamond films were 
performed by irradiating the surface with monochromatic laser light of various intensities.210, 211 By 
employing above bandgap light (>5.5 eV), cathodic photocurrents of a few A/cm2 were obtained. 
Irradiation with light that has an energy below the bandgap of diamond still resulted in detectable 
photocurrents. Since this effect was more pronounced for doped electrodes, the observed currents 
were related to energy states arising from dopants and the presence of graphitic sp2-carbon.212 The 
influence of the vacuum annealing temperature on the photopotential of undoped diamond 
electrodes was studied213 and photovoltaic cells were made that comprised an amorphous carbon (a-
C:H) film on top of a heavily doped BDD electrode.214 Since the a-C:H film has a lower bandgap 
(between 0.8 and 3.0 eV) than diamond, this layer mainly absorbs visible light, whereas diamond 
absorbs the UV light. By combining both layers, the photocurrents improved, but remained low (ca. 
20 nA/cm2). Next to the conversion of UV light to energy, diamond photovoltaic cells with a p-i 
structure were also investigated for the generation of photocurrents based on the absorption of α-
particles and X-rays.215 From the obtained open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) 
and the irradiation input, the conversion efficiencies for α-particles and X-rays were calculated to be 
4.5 and 8.2%, respectively. This is lower than the conversion efficiencies for UV light (14%). Diamond 
was also proposed as a potential material for the conversion of high energy ions, generated by 
nuclear reactions, to energy.216 
The previously mentioned applications all employ diamond as the absorber material. However, 
due to its large bandgap, photocurrents remained limited. Nevertheless, the optical transparency, 
surface inertness and tunable conductivity upon doping also allow to employ diamond in different 
other functions for photovoltaic applications. For instance, von Huth et al. constructed an inverted p-
n heterojunction solar cell wherein diamond was employed as the p-type window layer and CdTe as 
n-type absorber.217 Good energy level alignment of the valence band of diamond with the valence 
band of CdTe provided sufficient driving force for charge separation. J-V measurements for this solar 
cell revealed a VOC of 230 mV, a JSC of 1.54 mA/cm2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.32 when illuminated with 
AM 1.0 light. The low VOC and JSC were attributed to transmission losses related to the diamond film 
and high recombination in the CdTe film. In another application, diamond films were deposited on 
industrial silicon solar cells, which contributed to the stability of the devices under earth- and space- 
like illumination conditions (AM 1.0 and AM 0, respectively).218 Intrinsic diamond was also 
investigated as an alternative for Pt counter electrodes in TiO2 n-type DSSCs.219 The device efficiency 
of the diamond electrode-DSSCs (0.4%) was approximately 10 times lower as compared to that of the 
standard device, which was explained by the presence of a high resistance in undoped diamond 
films. In a similar experiment wherein BDD was used to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) as the 
electrode 
material 
in 
poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric 
acid 
methyl 
ester 
(P3HT:PC61BM) bulk heterojunction organic solar cells, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.91% 
was obtained.220 Again, the obtained values were significantly lower than when applying standard 
ITO electrodes. In this case, the decreased transparency of BDD and its increased roughness, which 
hinders electron transitions at the diamond-ZnO interface, were held accountable.

In addition to diamond thin films, nanodiamond has also been employed as p-type semiconductor 
to develop composite materials with fullerene-C60 derivatives and phthalocyanines.221, 222 Adding 
nanodiamond to the active layer led to improved light absorption and an increase of the interfacial p-
n heterojunction area. However, since no efficient pathways are available for charge separation in 
the donor/acceptor microstructure, strong charge recombination was observed.223 Nanodiamond has 
also been used as acceptor material in combination with tetrakis(carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP).224 
Herein, a nanodiamond-TCPP supramolecular assembly was made through hydrogen bond formation 
between diamond and the porphyrin chromophore. The resulting nanoclusters were deposited as a 
thin film on an ITO electrode and photocurrents of 31 A/cm2 were obtained under 0.1 sun 
illumination. Finally, blends of nanodiamond and regioregular P3HT were investigated as photoactive 
material. The obtained photocurrents were about 10 times larger than when TiO2 or ZnO 
nanoparticles were employed. In addition to the more favorable energy level alignment, a well-
structured hexagonal arrangement of the active layer was obtained in the films containing blends 
with nanodiamond.225, 226 
3.1.2. Functionalized diamond electrodes
When the absorption spectrum of diamond is compared with the photon flux density of solar 
light, which is the highest between 500 and 1500 nm, it is easy to understand that photovoltaics 
solely based on diamond as active material will always result in inefficient devices. To extend the 
absorption to the visible and potentially even the near-infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum, 
diamond can be sensitized with light-harvesting molecules through various functionalization 
strategies. Because of its p-type conductivity, BDD is a promising photocathode material for the 
development of DSSCs. The hole diffusion coefficient (230 cm2s-1)227 and optical transparency in the 
region between 300 and 1000 nm compare favorable to NiO, which is currently being employed as 
photocathode. In addition to this, the possibility to covalently functionalize diamond  resulting in 
actual C-C bonds between the dyes and the surface  has been demonstrated to be beneficial for the 
stability at the interface. 
The working principle of a p-type DSSC is illustrated in Figure 13. Under illumination, an electron 
is promoted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye to the lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leaving behind a positively charged hole in the ground state. 
For efficient photocurrent generation to occur, these charges need to be transported to the 
respective electrodes. The electron is first transferred to a redox electrolyte, which can diffuse to the 
counter electrode, whereas the positively charged hole is injected into the valence band of diamond. 
To minimize charge recombination, a good energy level alignment is required. Hence, the HOMO of 
the dye should be below the valence band maximum (VBM) of diamond (ca. -5.5 eV when in contact 
with an electrolyte solution), while the LUMO of the dye should be located above the redox potential 
of the employed electrolyte. However, the differences between the energy levels cannot be too large 
either as this will result in voltage drops. In the following paragraphs, the functionalization of 
diamond with metal-complex, donor-acceptor and some less conventional chromophores is 
discussed.

Figure 13  Schematic representation of the working mechanism of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells.
3.1.2.1. Metal-complex chromophores
Pioneering work on dye sensitization of p-type semiconductive diamond was performed by 
Fujishima and co. in 1999.228 In their first report, diamond was not yet covalently functionalized. A 
BDD working electrode was simply submerged in an electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M tetra-n-
butylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) and 0.1 mM tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) (Figure 
14a). Two diamond electrodes with different doping levels, showing acceptor densities of Na = 1017 
and 1019 cm-3, were investigated under illumination with 400600 nm light from a 150 W Xe arc 
lamp. Larger photocurrents (100 nA cm-2) were obtained for low acceptor density electrodes than for 
those with a higher density of acceptor states (12 nA cm-2) at an applied bias of -1.0 V. An 
explanation for this observation was found in the thickness of the space charge layer. In case of the 
more highly doped diamond, the strongly decreased size of this space charge layer hindered effective 
charge separation.
As mentioned above, good energy level alignment for the HOMO and LUMO of the dye with the 
valence band of diamond and the redox potential of the electrolyte are essential for the conversion 
of solar light into energy. Himpsel and coworkers studied the position of the energy levels for a 
bis(terpyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(tpy)2) dye that was covalently attached to a diamond electrode.229 
First, H-terminated diamond was functionalized with undecanol through photochemical grafting of 1-
undecen-11-ol. The alcohol moiety was subsequently converted to an azide, that was employed to 
attach an alkynylated Ru(tpy)2 complex via CuAAC chemistry (Figure 14b).116 Information on the 
position of the HOMO of the Ru dye was obtained through ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy

(UPS), while the position of the LUMO was determined via near edge x-ray absorption fine structure 
(NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The HOMO of surface attached Ru(tpy)2 was found to be 0.9 eV below the 
VBM of diamond. This large energy difference will surely result in a fast hole injection and 
regeneration of the dye. However, the voltage drop of 0.9 eV would lead to large losses in efficiency. 
Hence, no photochemical measurements were performed for these electrodes.
A 
more 
suitable 
system 
consisted 
of 
BDD 
electrodes 
functionalized 
with 
[cis-
bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) or N3 dye molecules through 
a combination of spontaneous diazonium grafting, Suzuki cross-coupling and EDC/NHS chemistry 
(Figure 14c).164 Spectroscopic analysis of the diamond electrodes revealed that approximately 3 x 
1014 Ru atoms were present per square centimeter, which is a quite dense film. UPS analysis also 
indicated that there is a more favorable energy level alignment of the N3 dye with diamond. The 
HOMO of the dye is situated 0.5 eV below the valence band of diamond, which provides sufficient 
driving force for hole injection without a too large voltage drop. Proof-of-concept 
photoelectrochemical measurements of these N3-functionalized surfaces were performed by 
employing diamond as a working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical setup. The 
electrodes where submerged in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution that contains 5 mM methyl 
viologen (MV2+), which serves as a redox couple. Under illumination of the electrodes with a 150 W 
halogen lamp at an intensity of 1.5 sun (150 mW cm-2, AM 1.5G), photocurrents of ca. 25 nA cm-2 
were obtained. During these chronoamperometric measurements, a negative bias of -0.1 V was 
applied to the system as this was previously demonstrated to positively influence the current 
generation due to the establishment of a net vectorial electron flow from the photocathode to the 
counter electrode.230, 231 
In addition to the commonly employed Ru-based dyes, other metal complexes have been 
investigated as well for the sensitization of diamond. For instance, manganese phthalocyanines (Mn-
Pc) were grafted onto the surface of OH/NH2-terminated boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond 
(Figure 14 d). This was done through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between the alcohol or 
amine group at the diamond surface and the metal center of Cl-Mn-Pc.232 Such a functionalization 
approach will result in a flat geometry of the phthalocyanines on the surface, which impedes high 
dye coverage. Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a phosphate buffed saline 
(PBS) solution under illumination with a light-emitting diode (LED) operating at 770 nm. In case of the 
samples where an OH-terminated surface was employed to graft the Mn-Pc dyes, either no or 
extremely weak photocurrents were observed. In contrast, the NH2-terminated surfaces afforded 
photocurrents up to 40 nA cm-2. Follow-up work demonstrated that a difference in band bending at 
the two surfaces is at the origin of the respective photovoltaic behavior. The moderate band bending 
at NH2-terminated surfaces allows a nearly barrier-free transition from the hole in the HOMO of the 
dye into diamond. Stronger band bending at OH-terminated surfaces on the other hand results in an 
energy barrier that is too high to overcome, preventing photocurrent generation.233

3.1.2.2. Donor-acceptor chromophores
A second class of dye molecules that has received considerable attention for application in DSSCs 
and (bulk heterojunction) organic photovoltaics are the push-pull or donor-acceptor chromophores. 
They typically consist of an electron-rich (donor) and an electron-deficient (acceptor) building block. 
The large variety of both donor and acceptor units enables easy tuning of the optical and 
electrochemical properties through molecular design. Other advantages of this family of dyes in 
comparison with Ru-based metal complexes are the high molar extinction coefficients, lower 
production costs and a smaller environmental impact.234 The first report on the functionalization of 
BDD with donor-acceptor chromophores for photovoltaic applications was published in 2008 by K.P. 
Loh and coworkers.138 Initial surface functionalization was performed via the electrochemical 
diazonium grafting of in situ diazotized 4-aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester. Next, the donor-
acceptor chromophore 2T-C60 was assembled on the surface in two steps (Figure 15a). First, the 
phenylboronic acid group was used to attach the bithiophene donor unit through Suzuki cross-
coupling with 5'-iodo-[2,2'-bithiophene]-5-carbaldehyde (I-2T-CHO). Secondly, the acceptor unit was 
coupled to the carbaldehyde moiety by refluxing the diamond substrate, fullerene-C60 and N-
methyglycine in toluene. It should be mentioned here that for donor-acceptor chromophores the 
organization of the dye on the surface plays an important role. After excitation of the chromophore, 
the generated charges will have the tendency to separate, where the electron and hole will move 
toward the electron-deficient (acceptor) and electron-rich (donor) building block, respectively. 
Hence, to minimize charge recombination, the donor unit should be as close as possible to the 
diamond electrode to ensure fast hole injection, while the acceptor unit should be in close proximity 
to the redox electrolyte. As a result, all donor-acceptor chromophores developed for sensitization of 
p-type photocathodes have a similar electrode-donor-acceptor structure. Photoelectrochemical 
measurements of the 2T-C60-functionalized diamond electrodes were performed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4/5 
mM MV2+ electrolyte solution at an applied bias of -0.1 V. These proof-of-concept measurements 
resulted in stable light photocurrents of ca. 130 nA cm-2. The stability of this system was attributed to 
the strong carbon-carbon bonds at the diamond-chromophore interface and the robustness of the

Suzuki coupling, resulting in a fully conjugated system that facilitates charge transport. In follow-up 
work by the same authors, photoelectrochemical currents of ca. 3.50 A cm-2 were measured under 
1 sun (100 mW cm-2, AM 1.5G) illumination without application of an external bias.166 
Employing a similar functionalization strategy  diazonium grafting and Suzuki cross-coupling  a 
second 
iodine-bearing 
donor-acceptor 
chromophore, 
2-([2,2'-bithiophen]-5-
ylmethylene)malononitrile (2T-(CN)2), was covalently immobilized onto diamond as well (Figure 15b). 
Also for this system, photocurrents of ca. 3.50 A cm-2 were obtained. Application of a -0.2 V bias 
lead to an increase of the photocurrent with 80% to approximately 6.3 A cm-2. The BDD electrodes 
were also benchmarked against ITO and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) functionalized using similar 
reactions. Despite a lower surface coverage (0.44 monolayers), the generated photocurrents on 
diamond electrodes were 2.3 and 3 times larger than those on ITO (0.60 monolayers) and FTO (0.55 
monolayers), respectively. Stability tests showed that after continuous illumination for 2 hours (1 
sun), the diamond electrodes only suffered a 10% decrease in photocurrent, whereas this was 40% 
and 36% for ITO and FTO, respectively. These results highlight the advantage of the strong carbon-
carbon bonds at the interface, which is unique to diamond photocathode materials.

Diamond surface functionalization with light-harvesting molecules through a combination of 
diazonium grafting and Suzuki cross-coupling was also investigated in our institute.141 In this work, 
special attention was devoted to the efficiency of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and the surface 
coverage was optimized by employing a combination of palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) and 2-
dicyclohexylphosphino-2,6-dimethoxybiphenyl (SPhos) as the catalyst system. SPhos is a sterically 
hindered electron-rich biarylmonodentate ligand that is employed for the coupling of large and bulky 
molecules.235 The electron-rich nature of the ligand favors oxidative addition, whereas its bulkiness 
results in a very reactive complex that undergoes rapid reductive elimination, affording increased

coupling efficiencies.236 Hence, the Suzuki coupling efficiency of a phenylboronic acid functionalized 
diamond surface with brominated (5-([2,2'-bithiophen]-5-ylmethylene)-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-
yl)acetic acid (BT-Rho) and (3-cyano-4-(2-(4,4-diethyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophen-2-
yl)vinyl)-5,5-dimethylfuran-2(5H)-ylidene)malononitrile (CPDT-Fur), as shown in (Figure 15c), was 
increased to 0.58 and 0.56 monolayers, respectively, an increase of approximately 30% compared to 
previous reports.166 The inverted functionalization strategy  bromophenyl functionalized diamond 
and chromophores carrying boronic acid groups  was also pursued, but a lower surface coverage 
was obtained. This was tentatively explained by the fact that the cross-coupling reaction proceeds 
slower when the Pd-complex is formed at the diamond interface, as was also observed for the Stille 
cross-coupling on diamond (vide infra).140 Both the BT-Rho and CPDT-Fur chromophores have high 
molar extinction coefficients (ε = 43 200 M-1 cm-1 at λmax = 473 nm and ε = 73 100 M-1 cm-1 at λmax = 
582 nm) and a suitable energy level alignment where the HOMO is situated 0.3 and 0.5 eV below the 
valence band of diamond, respectively (as determined by UPS). Illumination of diamond electrodes 
sensitized by BT-Rho provided photocurrents of ca. 85 nA cm-2, whereas those sensitized with CPDT-
Fur yielded currents up to approximately 140 nA cm-2. The measurements were performed in an 0.1 
M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution containing 5 mM methyl viologen under 0.15 sun irradiation (15 mA 
cm-2) at an applied bias of -0.2 V. Despite the increased surface coverage, the generated 
photocurrents are still several orders of magnitude lower than the state of the art TiO2 and NiO 
DSSCs. This can partly be attributed to the morphology of the diamond films. The employed flat 
diamond electrodes have a roughness factor (Rf) of 4, which is far lower than those of 
nanostructured TiO2 electrodes (RF = 1000). 
In order to improve the photocurrents, a mesoporous diamond electrode was created by spin-
coating silica spheres (d = 500 nm) on top of a flat BDD electrode.9 These spheres were subsequently 
overgrown with BDD (gas feed with a 12 000 ppm B/C ratio), resulting in 5-6 layers of diamond 
coated spheres. Finally, the silica spheres were etched away through an HF treatment, giving rise to a 
porous diamond electrode. The roughness factor for these diamond foams was calculated to be 114, 
approximately 30 times higher than for the thin films. Functionalization of these foam electrodes 
with BT-Rho and CPDT-fur resulted in photocurrents between 500 and 700 nA cm-2 under 0.2 sun 
illumination at an applied bias of -0.2 V. If we consider the slightly increased light intensity, only a 3-
fold increase in the photocurrent was obtained despite the nearly 30-fold increase in Rf value.165 This 
lower than proportional increase of the current is most likely caused by an incomplete dye coverage 
due to sp2 carbon impurities and a complex morphology of the diamond foam. 
Remarkable results were obtained when the long-term stability of BT-Rho functionalized 
electrodes was investigated under 1 sun illumination and at an applied bias of -0.3 V. Initially, 
currents of ca. 2 A cm-2 were observed, which is more or less proportional with the increased light 
intensity. However, after 24 hours of constant illumination, the photocurrents increased to ca. 15 A 
cm-2 and even values of 22 A cm-2 were reached for the best performing electrode. This so-called 
aging-activation mechanism was also observed for diamond foams functionalized with CPDT-Fur, 
albeit with lower photocurrents, as well as on flat diamond electrodes. Analysis of the action spectra 
(incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) vs. wavelength) for BT-Rho functionalized 
electrodes showed that the absorption peak at 470 nm gradually decreases over time, whereas the 
originally weaker absorption peak at 350 nm becomes more intense (Figure 16). This seems to 
indicate that degradation of the dye occurs. However, how this then positively influences the 
photocurrents has yet to be unraveled.

In addition to the Suzuki cross-coupling, other Pd-catalyzed reactions have also been investigated 
for the construction of uninterrupted conjugated diamond-chromophore systems. The Stille cross-
coupling was recently deemed unsuitable since a high amount of Pd and Sn impurities remained on 
the diamond surface due to the unstable nature of the organotin reagents.140 On the other hand, the 
Sonogashira cross-coupling, which uses more stable alkyne derivatives, was successfully employed to 
couple alkynylated 2-(benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazol-4-yl)-4-hexyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2,3-d]pyrrole (DTP-BT) 
onto iodophenyl-functionalized diamond (Figure 15d).159 By varying the employed catalyst system, 
base and concentration, the surface coverage, which is expressed by the atomic concentration of 
sulfur as measured by XPS, was increased from 1.1 to 2.3%. The photoresponse of the corresponding 
diamond electrodes increased accordingly from  200 to  450 nA cm-2 under 0.9 sun illumination at 
an applied bias of -0.2 V. The possibly negative effects of contamination with Pd were also 
demonstrated, as the photocurrents for samples that show increased Pd concentrations on the 
surface were considerably lower. The same alkynylated DTP-BT dye was also attached to an 
azidophenyl functionalized diamond electrode via CuAAC. By clicking the dye to the diamond 
surface, a slightly higher surface coverage was obtained. However, the generated photocurrents 
were 3 times lower (140 nA cm-2). The observed difference was ascribed to the employed linker. In 
comparison with the flat diamond electrodes functionalized via Suzuki cross-coupling, the 
photocurrents are slightly lower (taking into account the different light intensities). However, it 
should be mentioned that the molar extinction coefficient of the DTP-BT chromophore (ε = 18 600 M-
1 cm-1 at λmax = 474 nm) is rather modest and its high HOMO level (-5.21 eV), which is situated slightly 
above the VBM of diamond, is actually unfavorable for hole injection.
A final donor-acceptor chromophore that was thoroughly investigated by Krysova et al. is 4-(bis-
(4-[5-(2,2-dicyanovinyl)-thiophene-2-yl]phenyl)amino)benzoic 
acid 
or 
the 
P1 
dye. 
This 
commercially available chromophore has a high molar extinction coefficient of 58 000 M-1 cm-1 at a 
wavelength of 468 nm and was previously employed for sensitization of p-NiO,237 making it an 
excellent starting point in the quest for a suitable diamond sensitizer. The HOMO of P1 (-5.81 eV) is 
also well below the VBM of diamond in contact with an electrolyte solution. In their first study, BDD 
(gas feed with a 4,000 ppm B/C ratio) was first non-covalently functionalized by adsorption of a thin 
(5 nm) layer of polyethyleneimine (PEI). The amine groups on the polymer were then employed to 
form a stable amide bond through an acylation reaction with the acid chloride derivative of the P1

dye, P1-Cl (Figure 17a).238 The advantage of this functionalization strategy is obviously the 
circumvention of the sometimes complicated multi-step surface reaction sequence or the poor yields 
when the chromophores are directly attached to the surface. Photoelectrochemical measurements 
in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution with MV2+ as redox couple under 0.18 sun illumination resulted in 
photocurrents of ca. 130 nA cm-2 at an applied bias of -0.2 V. This demonstrates that PEI, which has 
insulating properties, does not prevent hole injection into diamond, which proceeds in a tunneling 
fashion.
In their second study related to the P1 dye, similar BDD electrodes were functionalized in a 
completely covalent fashion.109 The primary surface functionalization in a near monolayer fashion 
was done through photochemical grafting of short terminal alkene linkers, bearing a protected amine 
group. After deprotection, the amine could again be employed to form an amide bond with P1-Cl 
(Figure 
17b). 
The 
employed 
linkers 
are 
N-allyltrifluoroacetamide 
and 
N-
allyltrifluoromethanesulfonamide. Photoelectrochemical measurements on electrodes where the P1 
dye was tethered via a sulfonamide linker demonstrated a poorer performance (200 nA cm-2) than 
when an acetamide linker was employed (900 nA cm-2; under 1 sun illumination and at an applied 
bias of -0.3 V). This is somewhat surprising since the strong electron-accepting properties of the 
sulfonamide linker should facilitate photochemical grafting. However, sulfonamide protecting groups 
also require harsher deprotection conditions. As a result, a lower amount of P1 dye molecules can 
eventually be coupled in comparison with the acetamide linker, which is reflected in the 
photocurrents. The value of 900 nA cm-2 for a fully covalently functionalized electrode also compares 
favorably to the non-covalent approach previously employed, even after taking into account the 
difference in irradiation intensity. This highlights the importance of the actual carbon-carbon bond 
formation at the diamond interface.

Figure 17  Functionalization of boron-doped thin film diamond electrodes with the P1 dye through 
reaction with a. adsorbed PEI or b. photochemically grafted amine groups. 
The long term stability of these systems was evaluated upon extended illumination with 1 sun. A 
similar aging-activation phenomenon as for the diamond foams was observed. After 5 hours of 
chopped light illumination, the initial photocurrent increased from 900 nA cm-2 to 1.5 A cm-2, after 
which it dropped again to 600 nA cm-2 when the illumination was extended for up to 45 hours. In the 
most recent study, the fully covalent surface functionalization as demonstrated in Figure 17b was 
further improved by employing an upgraded photoelectrochemical setup. All reactions were initially 
performed on nanodiamond in order to carefully characterize the surface chemistry and then 
extended to flat diamond electrodes.239 This optimization resulted in a 3-fold increase of the 
photocurrents (2.5 to 3.2 A cm-2) when identical illumination (1 sun and a bias of -0.3 V) and doping 
(4,000 ppm B/C) conditions were applied. In addition to improving the surface functionalization, the 
influence of the doping level was addressed and diamond electrodes with varying doping levels (250,

500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 ppm B/C ratios in the gas phase) were investigated. Surface analysis of 
the different functionalized electrodes by AFM did not reveal any significant differences in 
morphology. Additionally, XPS analysis indicated a similar surface coverage for all samples based on 
the sulfur concentrations. Nevertheless, the generated photocurrents strongly increased with 
decreasing doping levels and stable (up to 1 hour) currents of 6.6 A cm-2 were generated for the 
diamond electrodes with the lowest (250 ppm B/C) doping level (Figure 18). The only notable 
difference between the samples was the lower oxygen concentration on the 250 ppm B/C sample. 
This lead to the hypothesis that oxygen-rich diamond surfaces are potentially undesirable for 
photocurrent generation in diamond-based DSSCs.

3.1.2.3. Various chromophores 
Apart from the metal complexes and donor-acceptor molecules, other types of chromophores 
have been employed as well to sensitize diamond electrodes. One such example is the polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. A BDD electrode was first treated with singlet oxygen to hydroxylate 
the surface. The resulting alcohol groups were then employed to anchor pyrenebutyric acid 
molecules through esterification (Figure 19a).178 Photoelectrochemical measurements were 
performed in a 0.1 NaCl solution under illumination with a 351 nm Ar laser at an intensity of 5 mW 
cm-2 and a bias of -0.2 V. When an Ar-purged electrolyte solution was employed, photocurrents of 
150 nA cm-2 were obtained. When the solution was saturated with oxygen, the photocurrents 
increased to 3.0 A cm-2, which was explained by the possibility of oxygen to react with excited 
pyrene molecules. 
Other work involved the electrostatic self-assembly of phosphotungstic acid (PTA), a type of 
polyoxometalate, on BDD electrodes functionalized with a bilayer of an in situ diazotized pyridinium 
dye through electrochemical diazonium grafting (Figure 19b).142 In the action spectrum of diamond 
electrodes functionalized with only the pyridinium dye, photocurrents of approximately 600 nA cm-2 
were detected at a wavelength of 350 nm and at an applied bias of -0.1 V. After self-assembly of PTA, 
the photocurrents remarkably decreased to only 50 nA cm-2 under similar operating conditions, 
indicating that the addition of PTA impedes the flow of electrons. Electrochemical analysis of the 
energy levels of PTA revealed that its redox potential is slightly below (0.3 eV) that of the redox 
couple MV2+/MV1+. As a result, the excited electrons from the HOMO of the dye are transferred back 
to the PTA layer, where recombination is higher since PTA cannot diffuse to the counter electrode.

of phosphotungstic acid (PTA) on diamond electrodes functionalized with a pyridinium dye. 
A limiting factor for high photocurrents on dye-sensitized electrodes, especially for diamond due 
to its intrinsic inertness, will always be the difficulty to anchor a large amount of chromophores. Lim 
et al. attempted to circumvent this problem by coating BDD with P3HT, a commonly employed 
polymer in organic photovoltaics.240 H-terminated, OH-terminated and O-terminated BDD electrodes 
were decorated with a thin (20 nm) layer of P3HT through spin-coating and the photovoltaic 
performance was compared to ITO. The lowest photocurrents  under 1 sun irradiation and no 
applied bias  were obtained for H-terminated diamond and the ITO reference (both ca. 3 A cm-2). 
OH-terminated diamond electrodes on the other hand generated currents of 9 A cm-2, whereas the 
best results were obtained for O-terminated diamond electrodes, with photocurrents of 12 A cm-2. 
The observed results can partially be explained by looking at the VOC for the different electrodes, 
which is defined by the energy difference between the Fermi level of the electrode and the redox 
potential of methyl viologen (Figure 20). H-terminated diamond and ITO both have a VOC of 100 mV, 
which is much smaller than the values (1.0 and 1.3 V) for OH- and O-terminated diamond, 
respectively. Additionally, in case of the OH- and O-terminated electrodes, an interfacial dipole with 
P3HT is present, which facilitates the injection of charge carriers, resulting in a higher photocurrent 
density. Under prolonged irradiation for 2 hours, no decrease in photocurrent was observed for O-
terminated electrodes, which is in sharp contrast with the 52% decrease on ITO after only 20 
minutes.

The final system discussed here for photovoltaic applications is somewhat unique in the sense 
that not merely simple dye molecules, but more complex reaction centers are employed. These 
reaction centers are the biological units that enable solar energy harvesting in plants and bacteria. 
Their highly efficient charge separation mechanism renders them attractive candidates for the 
development of bio-solar cells.241 However, great care is needed when immobilizing these 
reactions centers on inorganic electrodes to prevent their denaturation. Caterino et al. have 
successfully functionalized BDD electrodes with reaction centers via two different approaches (Figure 
21).208 In the first strategy, a monolayer of 6-phosphonohexanoic acid was grafted onto OH-
terminated diamond. The available carboxylic acid groups were then employed to anchor 
cytochrome c (cyt-c), an electron mediator that regenerates the reaction center, through an amide 
bond. Finally, the reaction centers were physisorbed onto the functionalized electrodes. 
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in 10 mM PBS buffer with 10 M cyt-c and 
100 M of free quinone molecule (Q0), which functions as a redox electrolyte (similar to MV2+ in the 
previously discussed systems). Upon irradiation with NIR light (870 nm) and at an applied bias of -0.1 
V, this system afforded photocurrents of 50 nA cm-2. An improvement to this system was made by 
replacing cyt-c with aminomethylferrocene (AMF). The more efficient electron transfer between 
AMF and the diamond electrode resulted in 5 times larger photocurrents (250 nA cm-2) and a faster 
response to light/dark. A second functionalization strategy involved the polymerization of poly(tert-
butyl methyl acrylate) brushes on the diamond surface.  Saponification of the methyl ester functional 
groups allowed attachment of AMF and physisorption of the reaction centers similar to the 
monolayer approach. Obviously, in this way a larger amount of reaction centers could be attached to 
the functional surface, which immediately translated itself in much higher photocurrents of 1500 nA 
cm-2. Despite the increasing distance from the reaction center to the electrode, the light/dark 
response did not decrease. Long-term stability measurements showed that after 15 hours of 
illumination, only 30% of the photocurrent was retained. This was attributed to a combination of 
denaturation and desorption of the reaction centers.

A summary of the performances for the discussed functionalized diamond photoelectrodes is 
presented in Table 1. Although it is not straightforward to compare the different results because of 
strong variations in the employed doping concentration, light source, light intensity and even applied 
bias, a few general conclusions can be drawn: (i) Covalent surface functionalization of diamond

electrodes results in a better photocurrent generation when compared to a non-covalent approach 
for the same dye system. (ii) Increasing the surface coverage by employing nanostructured diamond 
significantly improves the photocurrents. However, this increase is not proportional to the increase 
in surface area due to the higher sp2-carbon content in these nanostructured electrodes and their 
complex morphology. (iii) Lowering the boron doping concentration positively influences the 
photoelectrochemical performance. This can be partially explained by the fact that the structural 
quality of the diamond film increases with lower doping concentrations due to lower amounts of sp2 
carbon. However, it is remarkable that the sample that has a gas feed with a 250 ppm B/C ratio 
shows the best performance since the resulting boron concentration of 1 x 1020 places it slightly 
below the threshold to have a metallic conductivity,11 which is assumed to be necessary to obtain 
good charge carrier mobilities. Hence, further research on the influence of the doping concentration 
is required.

3.2.1. NH3 synthesis
Another specific feature that is strongly related to the surface functionalization of diamond is the 
possibility to generate solvated electrons.242 This is a direct consequence of the NEA intrinsic to H-
terminated diamond electrodes.243, 244 The terminal C-H bonds generate a surface dipole that lowers 
the electron affinity and thus increases the position of the conduction band minimum up to -1.3 eV 
(compared to the vacuum level).245 As a result, upon illumination of H-terminated diamond surfaces 
with UV light (hν > 5.5 eV), the electrons that are excited from the valence band to the conduction 
band can readily be ejected into vacuum or in a liquid in a barrier-free fashion.210, 246, 247 Through 
electron ejection into liquids, solvated electrons can be created. These solvated electrons are simple, 
yet, extremely potent reducing agents that can be employed in chemical and biological reactions.248-
250 In 2013, the group of R.J. Hamers was the first to demonstrate diamonds unique property to 
serve as a direct source of solvated electrons in water.242 The electron emission from diamond into 
water was detected by directly measuring the resulting solvated electrons employing transient 
absorption spectroscopy, as illustrated in Figure 22a. The diamond sample was illuminated using a 
pulsed UV laser (213 nm) while the change in intensity of a laser beam with a wavelength of 633 nm 
in parallel with the diamond surface was detected. In Figure 22b one can clearly see a decrease in 
intensity of the transmitted 633 nm light due to absorption by solvated electrons, which have a 
maximum lifetime of approximately 150 ns. By purging the aqueous solution for 90 seconds with 
N2O, a commonly known electron scavenger, both the intensity and lifetime of the solvated electrons 
drastically decreased. When performing this experiment under acidic conditions (pH = 2), barely any 
solvated electrons were detected since they rapidly react with protons to form neutral atomic 
hydrogen. When metallic electrodes (Niobium) are employed, the lifetime of the generated solvated 
electrons drastically decreased.251 This observation is easily explained by the presence of a 
continuum of states in metal surfaces, which provides an easy pathway for recombination. In 
diamond electrodes on the other hand, the energy of the solvated electrons lies well below the 
conduction band minimum and no or very limited states are available for recombination. The lifetime 
of solvated electrons near the diamond surface is therefore controlled by reactions with other 
chemical species. As mentioned above, these solvated electrons are extremely useful as they can be 
employed as strong reducing agents (ca. -4.6 V vs NHE) in chemical reactions that are not accessible 
through conventional methods.

One such example is the photocatalytic reduction of nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonia (NH3), which is 
especially difficult since binding both N2 and hydrogen gas (H2) to a solid-state catalyst is not 
convenient252, 253 and high-energy intermediates are involved in the reaction.254 By employing 
diamond as a source of solvated electrons, the issue of adsorbing N2 is circumvented and high-energy 
intermediates become more readily accessible.242 The actual capability of diamond to produce 
ammonia was demonstrated by employing a BDD sample of electrochemical quality in a single-
compartment cell filled with N2-saturated water under illumination with above-bandgap light. To 
maintain charge neutrality, it is required that for every reduction reaction, a corresponding oxidation 
reaction should occur as well. Since oxidation of water at a diamond electrode is an inefficient 
process, the reduction of ammonia is limited by the oxidation rate.255 Therefore, the efficiency was 
further improved by employing a dual-compartment cell, where the oxidation reaction occurs at a 
platinum electrode in a 0.002 M KI solution. During prolonged illumination of the diamond sample, 
the ability to reduce nitrogen was retained. However, with increasing illumination time, a gradual 
decrease in the activity was observed. XPS and valence-band photoemission spectroscopy showed 
that the initially H-terminated sample is slowly being oxidized and that the surface is gradually 
converted to one with a PEA, which prevents electron emission (since the conduction band minimum 
is below the vacuum level) and thus decreases the ammonia yield. The issue of the decreasing 
photocatalytic activity was resolved by changing from a H-terminated diamond sample to a NH2-
terminated one through plasma treatment of the surface.54 When operating at neutral pH values, all 
primary amino (C-NH2) groups at the diamond surface should be protonated,256 creating a positively 
charged layer, resulting in a NEA. As-prepared NH2-terminated diamond electrodes showed a similar 
efficiency in reducing N2 compared to a H-terminated surface. However, after briefly submerging the 
samples in concentrated HCl, an almost 2-fold increase in efficiency was observed (Figure 23). This 
can be attributed to the fact that in case of a monolayer of primary amine groups at neutral pH, only 
a fraction of the NH2 groups are protonated and more acidic conditions are required to overcome

coulombic repulsion between the positively charged groups.257, 258 The increased positive charge on 
the surface after submerging the samples in HCl facilitates electron emission and thus increases the 
ammonia yields. More importantly, XPS analysis of NH2-terminated samples showed a significant 
enhancement of the stability under the employed photochemical reaction conditions compared to 
the H-terminated samples.

Recently, the photoelectron emission of diamond and its ability to photo-catalyse the synthesis of 
ammonia has been further improved by developing an electrode where silver nanoparticles of 
approximately 100 nm are embedded within the diamond film.259 These diamond-Ag-diamond (D-Ag-
D) electrodes show a ca. 2.5-fold increase in ammonia yield compared to regular electrodes under 
illumination with full spectrum light for 5 hours. When a filter is employed that eliminates 
wavelengths below 225 nm, the D-Ag-D electrodes show a 5-fold increase, while upon eliminating 
wavelengths below 280 nm, a double efficiency is still obtained compared to the standard H-
terminated diamond (Figure 24).

To get a clear understanding of how Ag can influence the properties of diamond to reduce N2, the 
different pathways for the photoemission of electrons were investigated (Figure 25).259 The first 
pathway (1) involves the direct excitation of an electron from the valence band of diamond to the

conduction band upon illumination with above bandgap light. The presence of Ag nanoparticles can 
enhance the optical scattering and thus increase the optical path length for deep UV photons within 
the diamond film.260 The second pathway (2) involves internal photoemission, where electrons are 
directly excited from the valence band of Ag to the conduction band of diamond. Since the valence 
band of Ag lies slightly above that of diamond, the required wavelengths for this pathway should be 
below 260 nm. The final pathway (3) is classified as defect associated photoemission. In this case, 
electrons are excited from states associated to higher energetic sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon 
impurities present in the diamond lattice with wavelengths of ca. 350 nm. Incorporation of Ag 
nanoparticles could contribute to this pathway if the amount of graphitic carbon is increased by 
doing so. Based on the experimental results in Figure 25, it was concluded that the introduction of Ag 
nanoparticles has the strongest contribution to pathway (2), whereas pathway (3) is relatively 
unimportant.

A combination of experimental and theoretical studies has revealed that the reduction of N2 to 
ammonia in an aqueous solution proceeds via a single mechanism.251, 261, 262 First, the solvated 
electrons react with protons to form atomic hydrogen (e-(aq.) + H+    H•). Next, the atomic hydrogen 
will react with N2 to form N2H, which will again react with atomic hydrogen to produce diazene 
(N2H2). Diazene is a stable molecule that can be further reduced to hydrazine (N2H4) and ammonia 
(NH3).263, 264
3.2.2. CO2 reduction
Apart from the photoreduction of nitrogen gas to ammonia, the photo- and electrochemical 
properties of diamond also make it a very suitable candidate for the reduction of carbon dioxide. 
Nowadays, decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth atmosphere is receiving a huge 
amount of attention, also at a political level, and large investments for the development of novel 
technologies are being made because of the impeding climate crisis. However, research on the 
photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 in aqueous conditions has already been performed since the 
70s.265 Depending on the employed electrode material, carbon dioxide can be transformed into a

reduction of CO2,117 or the boron/nitrogen-doped diamond is employed as such, while applying a 
reductive potential using cyclic voltammetry.268, 269 Only in 2014, the photochemical properties of 
diamond were harnessed for the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide.270 BDD electrodes of 
electrochemical grade in an electrolyte solution with a Pt counter electrode (dual-compartment cell) 
were pressurized to 2.5 MPa with CO2. Upon illumination with UV light, CO2 was reduced to CO with 
very high selectivity (more than 95%) over the reduction of H+ to form hydrogen gas. Similar to the 
reduction of N2, the mechanism is expected to proceed through (1) the excitation of an electron from 
the valence band of diamond to its conduction band and (2) subsequent emission into the aqueous 
solution, (3) generating solvated electrons (Figure 26). These solvated electrons have strong 
reductive properties and can react in a one-electron reaction with either H+ or CO2 to form H• or 
CO2•-. Due to the high CO2 concentration (2.5 MPa) and lower energy of the CO2 anion radical, the 
latter reaction is favored. CO2•- then further photo-dissociates into CO.

The same experiment was also performed by dispersing detonation nanodiamond (ca. 5 nm 
diameter) in water. In this setup, a single-compartment cell had to be employed, so both the 
reduction and oxidation reaction occur at the diamond electrode.251 However, employing isotopically 
labeled 13CO2 revealed that the detected 12CO did not originate from the photocatalytic reduction of 
13CO2, but from oxidation of carbon from the diamond surface itself, which is favored over the 
oxidation of water.271 To avoid this photo-induced etching of diamond, two specific improvements to 
the system were made.272 First, the detonation nanodiamond, which was determined to have a large 
amount of reactive surface defects and possible poor H-termination, was replaced with nanoparticles 
made from natural diamond (ca. 125 nm diameter). These nanoparticles have a better crystal quality, 
which diminishes oxidation of the surface, and superior H-termination, which favors electron 
emission.273 Next, an electrolyte solution containing Na2SO4 and Na2SO3 was employed as a sacrificial 
donor. The SO32- anion is an efficient hole scavenger and its oxidation provides an alternative, more 
suitable pathway for maintaining charge neutrality in the system, decreasing the oxidation of the 
diamond surface itself. These combined efforts resulted in the successful reduction of CO2 to CO 
employing diamond nanoparticles. However, the required high operating pressure of 2.5 MPa to 
favor CO2 reduction over H2 gas production is inconvenient for actual applications. 
Roy et al. studied an alternative approach to employ diamond electrodes for the reduction of CO2 
at atmospheric pressure and temperature by electrodepositing Ag nanoparticles on top of O-
terminated lightly boron-doped diamond (BDDL) electrodes.274 By cycling to a reductive potential of -
1.5 V vs. RHE, a clear reduction peak could be observed when the BDDL-Ag electrode was employed

in a CO2 saturated aqueous solution with and without illumination (Figure 27a). While applying a 
constant potential of -1.1 V vs. RHE, the dark experiment showed a rapid decrease of the 
photocurrent from -0.3 to -0.2 mA/cm2. The experiment where the samples were illuminated with 
UV light (222 nm) showed an increase in activity, which stabilized after approximately 60 minutes, as 
shown in Figure 27b. The observed increase in photocurrent density was attributed to the photo-
excitation and activation of the Ag-covered BDDL electrodes. Analysis of the reduction products 
revealed a Faradaic efficiency of 72.5% for CO and 9.08% for H2 for a Ag-covered diamond electrode 
electrodeposited from a 0.1 M AgNO3 solution. The high product selectivity for CO was obtained due 
to the presence of the Ag nanoparticles. A decrease of the AgNO3 concentration resulted in lower 
Faradaic efficiencies for CO. Employing highly boron-doped diamond (BDDH) or glassy carbon 
electrodes also had a negative influence on the selective reduction to CO. The performance of these 
Ag-covered BDDL electrodes was further improved via a pretreatment of the diamond surface.275 This 
was done by cycling the BDD electrode between a potential of 0 and -2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 250 cycles 
in a sulfuric acid solution, resulting in H-termination of the surface. The resulting NEA lead to a 
positive shift of the current for the reduction of CO2 with approximately 0.4 V and the Faradaic 
efficiency for CO further increased to 77.6%.

3.2.3. Water Splitting
Amongst the different photocatalytic applications, the conversion of water to O2 and H2 gas might 
be the one with the highest environmental impact as this allows the conversion of solar energy into 
chemical fuel. In these photoelectrochemical cells, sunlight is absorbed by a semiconductor and the 
resulting electron-hole pairs can catalyze the splitting of water into its components. Depending on 
the employed photocatalyst, water is either oxidized or reduced in the respective oxygen or 
hydrogen evolution reaction at the working electrode. Generally, a broad absorption window, good 
charge separation and long term stability of the electrode material are required to obtain efficient 
electrodes for solar water splitting.276 Although diamond is not an ideal candidate as a photocatalyst 
for water splitting due to its wide bandgap, H-terminated detonation nanodiamond has been 
employed for the photocatalytic reduction of water.277 Nevertheless, the true potential of diamond 
for water splitting lies in its application as a protective coating due to its high corrosion resistance 
and transparency or as electrode material due to its good p-type conductivity upon doping with

boron. Since diamond will only function as a backing electrode or coating, a suitable semiconductor 
should be employed to provide sufficient energy for the electrolysis of water.278 
Silicon-based photoelectrodes absorb a significant fraction of the solar light and they have been 
proven to be excellent materials for the development of solar cells. However, application of silicon in 
water splitting is limited due to its high sensitivity for corrosion and dissolution of the electrode 
material under continuous oxidizing conditions in a photoelectrochemical cell. By employing 
conductive BDD as a coating, Ashcheulov et al. were able to protect the underlying silicon 
photoelectrode during the oxygen evolution reaction (Figure 28).279 However, since diamond has a 
wide electrochemical potential window and thus poor catalytic properties, the oxygen evolution 
reaction has a large onset potential of 1.9 V vs. RHE in dark conditions, whereas the water oxidation 
potential is 1.23 V vs. RHE. The low catalytic activity and large overpotential for the oxygen evolution 
reaction was addressed by electrodepositing cobalt phosphate, an oxygen evolution catalyst, onto 
the diamond coating.280 This resulted in a significant reduction of the water oxidation onset potential 
to 1.6 V vs. RHE. Under 1 sun illumination, the photovoltaic component of the photoelectrode 
provided a photovoltage of approximately 0.5 V, which promotes charge separation of the generated 
holes and electrons. Upon injection of the holes into the valence band of diamond, they can 
participate in the oxidation of water, which further decreased the onset potential to  1.1 V vs. RHE. 
In addition to employing diamond coated Si photovoltaics for the oxygen evolution reaction, Halima 
et al. investigated their performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic conditions, 
which improved the stability of the electrode. However, it should be mentioned that in this study all 
experiments were performed without exposure to light.281

electrode. [Reprinted with permission, Copyright (2018), American Chemical Society]280
Diamond can also serve as backing electrode material since it demonstrated superior 
performances in a benchmarking study against different electrodes for photoelectrochemical water 
splitting.282 Geiger et al. have constructed p-n hetero-structured electrodes to enhance the oxygen 
evolution reaction by sputtering a uniform TiO2 thin film on BDD.283 Optimization of the electrodes 
was performed by varying the sputtering time. The best electrode showed low leakage currents and 
a remarkably high rectifying ratio of 63,773 at an applied potential of 5.0 V. For

photoelectrochemical water splitting under 1 sun illumination, the generated currents for 
TiO2/diamond and the TiO2 reference electrode were similar when the voltage was increased from -
0.1 to +0.43 V vs SHE. However, in the potential region above 0.43 V, the TiO2/diamond electrode 
showed superior behavior, with an increase of 60% compared to the TiO2 reference. The improved 
quality of the hetero-structured electrodes is ascribed to the presence of a high quality p-n junction 
that promotes charge separation. 
In addition to covering diamond with TiO2, which is an efficient photocatalyst for the oxygen 
evolution reaction, BDD electrodes have also been functionalized with NiO-Cu2O particles to catalyze 
the hydrogen evolution reaction.284 The bandgap and energy levels of Cu2O make it an interesting 
material for the photoelectrochemical reduction of water. However, the short exciton diffusion 
length, low hole mobilities and self-photo-corrosion of Cu2O limit its practical application. By 
employing NiO as a co-catalyst, self-photo-corrosion of Cu2O can be overcome. Hence, after 
electrodepositing cubic Cu2O particles on BDD, the electrodes were functionalized with NiO particles 
through repetitive dip-coating steps. Photoelectrochemical performances of the photocatalysts were 
evaluated under 1 sun illumination. When no external potential was applied one can see from Table 
2 that the photocurrent increased with an increasing amount of coating steps up to 15 layers. The 
improved activity of the photoelectrochemical cell is a result of the suitable energy level alignment of 
the NiO-coated Cu2O particles, which facilitates transfer of the generated charges to the interface. 
Further increasing the amount of NiO on the electrode to 20 layers resulted in a decrease of the 
photocurrent since a too thick layer of NiO hinders photoabsorption by Cu2O. Also, it should be 
mentioned that after 6 coatings steps, the photoconversion efficiency dropped due to an increased 
dark current.

Apart from thin film heterostructures, composite materials were made by embedding 
nanodiamond in Cu2O nanocrystals. The electron-donating behavior of nanodiamond and a suitable 
energy level alignment promote electron injection from diamond into the Cu2O matrix. As a result, 
these nanocomposites demonstrated an improved charge separation and thus higher hydrogen 
evolution reaction rates compared to Cu2O only.285 The hydrogen evolution for nanodiamond-Cu2O 
nanocrystals were studied under 1 sun illumination. Upon increasing the nanodiamond loading, the 
H2 production increased accordingly, reaching a maximum at 3 wt%. Further increase of the 
nanodiamond loading again resulted in a decrease of the H2 yield. Similar results were observed for 
nanodiamond-graphitic carbon nitride (ND@g-C3N4) heterostructures. Here, a maximum yield for the 
hydrogen evolution reaction was observed for a nanodiamond content of 12 wt%.286 In both cases, 
addition of nanodiamond improved the light absorption due to efficient light scattering at the 
nanodiamond/g-C3N4 or Cu2O interface. The photoluminescence intensity of the composites was also

significantly lower, which indicates a suppression of charge recombination. Hence, the addition of 
nanodiamond allows the generation of more charge carriers, while improving their separation at the 
same time. However, employing an excessive amount of nanodiamond might hinder the contacts 
between the photocatalyst and the reagent, water, resulting in a lower hydrogen gas yield.   
4. Conclusions and future perspectives 
In order to transform diamond from a simply beautiful object to a relevant photoelectrochemical 
material, understanding and controlling the surface chemistry plays a crucial role. Diamond is 
generally considered to be a very inert material that is difficult to functionalize. However, after three 
decades of research on its surface chemistry, a multitude of innovative methods have been 
developed to alter the diamond surface composition and to attach functional (macro)molecules. The 
hydrogen termination on as-grown CVD diamond is readily exchanged for oxygen, nitrogen and even 
halogen atoms, drastically altering the surface properties. Depending on the treatment protocol or 
the applied potential during electrochemical oxidation, the ratio of alcohol, carbonyl and ether 
species can be controlled.32, 48 In most cases, OH-termination is desired as this enables 
straightforward further functionalization via silanization, esterification or thermal alkylation. 
Similarly, for nitrogen-terminated surfaces a high amount of primary amine groups is targeted 
toward subsequent amidation reactions, which can be achieved by controlled plasma treatments.70 
On the other hand, H-terminated surfaces have also been employed to covalently attach small 
(linker) molecules via stable and robust carbon-carbon bonds. This, however, remains limited to two 
well-known approaches, i.e. diazonium and photochemical grafting. Nevertheless, significant 
improvements have been achieved over the years for both grafting procedures. A major drawback of 
electrochemical diazonium grafting, the lack of control over the thickness of the grafted layer and 
multilayer formation, has been resolved. By either controlling the charge in a constant potential 
method, employing bulky diazonium salts, adding radical scavengers or using the spontaneous 
grafting method, thin monolayers can be obtained. Very recently, an alternative for the 
photochemical grafting of alkenes has also been proposed, that generates surface radicals, which can 
react with the terminal alkene functionalities.287 Accordingly, a broader range of molecules can be 
grafted to the surface since the prerequisite that they should not absorb light at 254 nm, as 
employed in photochemical grafting, no longer holds. Functionalization of diamond with molecules 
bearing reactive moieties via diazonium or photochemical grafting enabled the exploration of 
numerous chemical reactions on diamond. In this way, complex light-harvesting small molecule 
chromophores have been immobilized on the diamond surface toward the development of p-type 
dye-sensitized solar cells. Very important here is a good energy level alignment between the dye 
molecules and both the valence band of diamond and the reduction potential of the redox 
electrolyte. Hence, the surface has been decorated with various metal-complex, donor-acceptor and 
less conventional dyes such as polyoxometalates and biological reaction centers. Combined efforts 
on optimization of the employed chromophores and diamond surface chemistry resulted in the 
improvement of the photocurrent from a few nA to 6.5 A cm-2 for boron-doped nanocrystalline thin 
films and even 22 A cm-2 for boron-doped diamond foams.165, 
239 Additionally, the 
photoelectrochemical properties of diamond have been harnessed for the creation of solvated 
electrons, which are extremely potent reduction reagents that allow for the synthesis of ammonia 
from nitrogen and the reduction of carbon dioxide. Again, the surface functionalization plays a 
crucial role. Decorating diamond with protonated primary amines for instance increases the 
ammonia yield by a 3-fold.54 Similarly, embedding Ag nanoparticles in the diamond film or putting

them on top of the surface results in a more efficient reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon 
monoxide.259, 275
It should be mentioned here that in most cases the diamond surface functionalization has been 
limited to a single functional group, despite the existence of patterning methods and the availability 
of orthogonal functionalization strategies. For example by applying both photochemical grafting and 
thermal alkylation procedures on a partially oxidized surface, two different functionalities can readily 
be introduced. Even on a completely H-terminated surface, mixed layers can be prepared via 
diazonium grafting of different diazonium salts.144 This can afford significant advances in the solar cell 
field since dyes with a complementary absorption spectra can be attached. On the other hand, also 
biosensors can be developed that screen for multiple target molecules. Therefore, we believe that 
continued efforts in exploring and optimizing the diamond surface chemistry, with special emphasis 
on multifunctionalized surfaces, will pave the road to various applications of functional diamond 
substrates.
