The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. Reduction of active Cr3+ species to inactive Cr2+ species

Various regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. CO2 addition:
- Helps maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state
- Can eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase
- Has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamic stability
- Does not significantly decrease selectivity
- More effective when promoted by Ni, which enhances CO2's ability to reoxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+

2. O2 addition:
- Improves oxidizing power when used as a co-feed with CO2
- Decreases the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts
- However, significantly decreases the selectivity for propylene (C3H6)

3. Ni promotion with CO2:
- Enhances CO2 conversion
- Maintains stable production of propylene
- Dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads
- Regenerates reduced Cr2+ species to Cr3+ through reoxidation
- Maintains stable catalytic activity

The literature does not provide specific information on air regeneration, temperature requirements for these methods, or their impact on VOx-catalyzed reactions. The addition of Ni as a promoter in combination with CO2 appears to be the most effective method for maintaining catalytic performance and mitigating deactivation in Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include thermal cracking reactions leading to coke formation and the production of light alkanes. These processes result in decreased product yield and increased catalyst deactivation.

          Various regeneration methods have been explored, with CO2 emerging as a promising oxidant. CO2 has been shown to promote high propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The effectiveness of CO2 as a regeneration agent is attributed to two key reactions:

          1. The reverse water gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), which enhances the overall reaction rate by shifting the equilibrium towards the products.

          2. The Boudouard reaction (C + CO2 → CO), which helps remove carbon deposits from the catalyst surface, improving catalyst stability.

          While the literature does not provide specific comparisons of different regeneration methods or their temperature requirements, it suggests that CO2 addition can be effective in mitigating catalyst deactivation and improving selectivity. The promoting effect of CO2 becomes more significant at higher temperatures, particularly above 550°C for gallium oxide catalysts.

          The literature does not specifically address the comparison of regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the principles discussed for gallium oxide catalysts may be applicable to other metal oxide systems, suggesting that CO2 could potentially play a beneficial role in regenerating and stabilizing various catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups from the catalyst surface
2. Formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface, encapsulating the active chromium oxide phase
3. Poisoning or decomposition of acidic surface sites

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation. However, CO2 is too mild an oxidizing agent to effectively remove carbonaceous deposits at the temperatures used in the catalytic experiments.

2. Temperature requirements: The study indicates that higher temperatures would be required for CO2 to be effective in gasification of coke deposits. The text mentions that oxidation of the fresh Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst in air begins at temperatures as low as 300°C, while reaction with CO2 starts around 650°C.

3. Effectiveness: The effectiveness of CO2 in regeneration appears limited. The study does not provide direct comparisons between different regeneration methods such as air or O2.

4. Impact on catalytic performance: The impact of CO2 addition on catalytic performance was mixed. While it increased initial activity and selectivity, it also led to faster deactivation due to higher propene yield, which can be a precursor for coke formation.

The study does not provide specific information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coking: Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to coke deposition and catalyst deactivation.

2. Loss of active sites: Over time, the highly dispersed active CrOx species may agglomerate or transform into less active forms, reducing catalytic activity.

3. Pore blockage: Coke formation and structural changes can lead to a decrease in pore volume and specific surface area, limiting access to active sites.

4. Gradual activity loss: The initial conversion of propane decreases over time, indicating a gradual deactivation process.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. The study mentions catalyst activation and regeneration in air flow at 600°C for 2 hours before the reaction and 6 hours after the experiment, respectively. This suggests that reoxidation with air at high temperatures is an effective method for catalyst regeneration.

2. The literature does not provide information on comparisons between different regeneration methods or the specific impacts of CO2 addition on VOx-catalyzed reactions.

3. The long-term test results show that catalyst activity initially decreases but then stabilizes, suggesting that some form of in-situ regeneration or stability mechanism may be at play during the reaction process.

The document does not provide sufficient information to fully answer all aspects of the question, particularly regarding VOx catalysts and the comparison of various regeneration methods.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

          1. Coke formation: The produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has a lower bond dissociation energy than the starting alkanes. This leads to faster hydrogen abstraction from the allylic position, resulting in coke precursors and catalyst deactivation.

          2. Reduction of metal oxides: During the reaction, the metal oxides (Cr and V species) can be reduced from their higher oxidation states, decreasing their catalytic activity.

          Regarding regeneration methods:

          1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of both Cr and V species during the reaction. It keeps the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2. This method is effective at the reaction temperature and does not require additional heating.

          2. Reoxidation with air or O2: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, these are common methods for regenerating reduced metal oxide catalysts. They would likely be more effective than CO2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst but may require higher temperatures and could potentially lead to overoxidation.

          The impact of CO2 addition on catalytic performance includes:

          1. Maintaining catalyst activity: By keeping the metal oxides in a higher oxidation state, CO2 helps maintain catalyst activity over time.

          2. Mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions: The ability of CO2 to maintain a slightly higher oxidation state without fully oxidizing the catalyst suggests it could help balance the oxidation state and potentially mitigate overoxidation.

          3. Promoting dehydrogenation: The presence of CO2 was shown to increase alkene yields in several cases, particularly for propane dehydrogenation.

          Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it's noted that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K for C3 and C4 alkanes) help maintain vanadium oxide in higher oxidation states, suggesting that regeneration temperatures should be carefully controlled to balance effective reoxidation with prevention of thermal degradation.

          Overall, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for maintaining catalyst activity and potentially extending catalyst lifetime, while also promoting the desired dehydrogenation reactions and mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The literature primarily focuses on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of deactivation causes and regeneration methods for different metal oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The main cause appears to be reduction of the metal oxide surface during the dehydrogenation reaction. This is evidenced by the observation that a partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst is more active than a reduced one.

2. Regeneration method - CO2 addition: The study demonstrates that CO2 addition has a positive effect on catalyst performance and longevity:
   - It enhances the yield of C3H6 (propylene)
   - It suppresses catalyst deactivation
   - It helps maintain the catalyst surface in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation

3. Effectiveness: CO2 addition was found to be effective in suppressing deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, resulting in a slower decrease in C3H6 yield compared to reactions without CO2.

4. Temperature: The experiments were conducted at 823 K (550°C), but the study doesn't compare this to other temperatures or regeneration methods.

5. Impact on catalytic performance: CO2 addition improved both initial activity and long-term stability of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

The study does not provide information on VOx catalysts or other regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air or O2. It also doesn't discuss the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. To fully answer the question, additional research on these aspects would be necessary.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: This is the main cause of reversible deactivation, affecting catalyst activity differently depending on textural features and the amount of Brønsted acid sites. The extent of coke formation varies with the oxidant used, being highest in direct dehydrogenation and lowest with O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures.

2. Changes in the oxidation state of chromium species: This is a reversible process that can affect catalyst performance. The oxidation state depends on the oxidant used, with CO2 resulting in Cr2+ species and O2 (alone or with CO2) resulting in Cr3+ species.

3. Aggregation of metal species: This can occur during reactions, particularly when O2 is used as an oxidant.

4. Textural changes: Different textural features of the catalysts can influence their susceptibility to deactivation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This method is effective in removing coke, reversing Cr species aggregation, and restoring catalyst activity. The temperature typically used is around 873 K for at least 6 hours.

2. Using CO2 as an oxidant: This approach reduces coke formation compared to direct dehydrogenation and maintains Cr in a lower oxidation state (Cr2+).

3. O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures: These are most effective in reducing coke formation during the reaction and maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state (Cr3+).

The effectiveness of these methods varies, with O2-based regeneration seeming most effective at reversing deactivation. However, using CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and potentially improving selectivity. All regeneration methods were effective in preventing irreversible deactivation, allowing the catalysts to maintain their performance over multiple runs.

The study does not provide specific information about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Coke formation: This is the main cause, evidenced by carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, observed through Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts.

2. Reduction of active metal species: The catalysts become progressively reduced during the reaction, leading to a decline in activity.

3. Structural rearrangement: High temperatures during reaction or regeneration can cause changes in the oxide structure.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This method is effective for removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The process is most intense during the first 8-10 minutes, with CO2 and minor amounts of CO being formed. After about 15 minutes, the formation of these compounds becomes negligible, indicating that the regeneration process is complete.

2. Temperature requirements: Higher temperatures are generally needed for complete regeneration, but this risks further structural changes to the catalyst. The literature mentions a temperature of 550°C for the reoxidation process.

3. Effectiveness: While regeneration is generally effective, there may be some drawbacks:
   - Incomplete reoxidation of reduced vanadium species
   - Incomplete removal of coke
   - Possible rearrangement of the V oxide structure due to the highly exothermal oxidation treatment

4. CO2 regeneration: While not explicitly mentioned for these catalysts, CO2 could potentially offer milder oxidation conditions, potentially reducing overoxidation issues.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not directly addressed in the provided information. However, using CO2 as a milder oxidant could potentially help balance the need for reoxidation with the risk of overoxidation and structural damage associated with more aggressive oxidants like O2.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods have been studied to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can recover most of the activity and selectivity.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with this recovery being repeatable for at least 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While effective for complete recovery in the second cycle, it cannot prevent further deactivation in subsequent cycles. For VOx catalysts, CO2 cannot fully reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5 but can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4.

4. Co-feeding O2 during CO2ODHP: This approach promotes coke removal during the reaction but leads to a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

In terms of effectiveness, O2 regeneration appears to be the most efficient for Cr-based catalysts, offering complete and repeatable recovery. The temperature requirements for these regeneration methods are generally in the range of 550-650°C.

For VOx-catalyzed reactions, adding CO2 to the feed gas of C3H8/O2 has shown promise in mitigating overoxidation. This approach decreases surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites, potentially improving selectivity towards desired products.

The impact on catalytic performance varies depending on the regeneration method. While most methods can restore activity and selectivity, there are trade-offs. For instance, co-feeding O2 during the reaction removes coke but reduces selectivity. The choice of regeneration method depends on the specific catalyst system and the desired balance between activity recovery and product selectivity.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the ability of the catalyst surface to reoxidize becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs, especially during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The extent of carbon deposition varies with vanadium content, with catalysts having near-monolayer coverage showing higher weight losses during TGA. This carbon deposition is associated with higher catalytic activity.

3. Reduction of VOx species: During the reaction, VOx species are reduced, as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of Raman peaks associated with V=O stretching modes.

4. Presence of promoters: The addition of Na+ adversely affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, preventing the regeneration of the catalytically active V5+ oxidation state necessary for propane activation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as evidenced by the weight loss observed during TGA in air for used catalysts.

2. O2 ODH results in very little carbon deposition compared to CO2 ODH, suggesting that O2 may be more effective at preventing carbon buildup during the reaction.

3. CO2 as an oxidant leads to more carbon deposition than O2, but it may help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions due to its milder oxidizing nature.

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods likely depends on the extent of carbon deposition and the degree of VOx reduction. Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the TGA analysis suggests that air treatment at elevated temperatures can remove carbon deposits. The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration is not directly addressed in the provided information.

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation discussed in this literature is carbon deposition or coking on the catalyst surface, particularly observed for Ga2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This deactivation occurs rapidly, with significant performance decrease after just 1 hour of reaction time.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature only discusses the use of CO2 for regeneration. It suggests that CO2 can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. However, the effectiveness of this method appears limited, as the amount of CO produced (indicating carbon removal) decreases with repeated pulses of CO2.

The literature does not provide information on regeneration using air or O2, nor does it compare different regeneration methods in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation is not directly addressed for VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the study shows that for Ga2O3 catalysts, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation due to coking during continuous operation.

It's important to note that this literature focuses primarily on Ga2O3 catalysts rather than Cr-based or VOx catalysts, so the information may not be directly applicable to those systems. The study also indicates that high temperatures accelerate coke formation, which is exacerbated by the presence of acid sites on the catalyst.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.
2. Aggregation of active species: The decreased dispersion of Cr species due to sintering or clustering.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours. This method was not fully effective in recovering catalyst activity.
2. Air regeneration: Conducted at 500°C. This method also failed to fully restore the initial catalyst activity.

Both regeneration methods showed limited effectiveness in recovering the catalyst's original performance. The temperature requirements for both methods were similar, around 500°C.

The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration was negative, as neither method could fully restore the initial activity. This suggests that the deactivation caused by aggregation of Cr species is not easily reversed by these regeneration processes.

The provided information does not include specific details about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, these aspects cannot be addressed based on the given information.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for both Cr-based and VOx catalysts.
2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion can cause chromia to incorporate into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.
3. Reduction of active species: The hydrocarbon feed can reduce the active metal oxide species (e.g., Mo6+ to lower oxidation states, Fe2O3 to Fe3O4), potentially altering their catalytic activity.
4. Strong adsorption of reactants on active sites.
5. Sintering of metal oxide species, forming larger crystallites or mixed oxides (e.g., V2O5 crystallites or AlVO4).

Regeneration methods and their comparison:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2:
- Most common and effective method for removing coke deposits
- Can restore activity but may lead to gradual irreversible deactivation, especially for Cr-based catalysts
- High temperatures (e.g., 600°C for V2O5) can cause thermal stress and sintering

2. CO2 addition:
- Acts as a milder oxidant, increasing alkene yields
- Helps reduce coke formation through the Boudouart reaction
- Assists in product desorption
- Oxidizes overly reduced vanadium centers
- Removes hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions
- Can be effective at lower temperatures and during the reaction itself

3. Steam addition:
- Similar to CO2, helps reduce coke deposition
- Assists in product desorption

4. Hydrogen addition:
- Can help control coke formation

Temperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to or slightly higher than reaction temperatures. Lower temperatures are preferred to minimize thermal stress and sintering, but must be high enough to effectively remove coke.

Impact on catalytic performance:

- Air regeneration can restore most of the initial activity but may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over multiple cycles.
- CO2 and steam addition can improve catalyst stability and olefin yield, but may also competitively adsorb on active sites.
- The use of promoters (e.g., MgO, K) can enhance catalyst stability and reduce coke formation.

Overall, while these regeneration methods can effectively remove coke and restore some activity, they may not fully address all forms of deactivation, particularly the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts. Balancing the regeneration conditions to maximize coke removal while minimizing irreversible deactivation is crucial for maintaining long-term catalytic performance. The use of CO2 or steam as mild oxidants shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and mitigating some deactivation mechanisms, particularly for VOx catalysts where overoxidation is a concern.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Formation of bulk V2O5, which decreases selectivity and favors total oxidation.
2. Clustering of VOx species during reaction.
3. Surface carbon formation (coking).
4. Reduction of active metal oxide species (e.g., V2O5 to V2O3).

Regeneration methods comparison:

1. Reoxidation with O2: Most effective, capable of fully oxidizing V2O3 back to V2O5. However, this can lead to overoxidation and formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. Reoxidation with CO2: Less aggressive, oxidizing V2O3 only to V2O4. This partial reoxidation helps maintain catalyst selectivity by preventing overoxidation. CO2 regenerates about 45% of the exchangeable oxygen compared to O2.

3. Reoxidation with air: Not explicitly discussed in the given text, but likely similar to O2, though possibly less intense due to dilution with nitrogen.

CO2 addition impacts on catalytic performance:

1. Participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. Suppresses surface carbon formation, with carbon deposition being three times less when CO2 is present in the reaction mixture.
3. Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by only partially reoxidizing the catalyst (to V2O4 instead of V2O5), potentially maintaining better selectivity.
4. Allows for lower reaction temperatures.

The addition of WOx to VOx catalysts improves performance by hindering the clustering of VOx species during reaction and acting as a physical barrier between VOx species.

While specific temperature requirements are not mentioned, the effectiveness of CO2 as a milder oxidant compared to O2 suggests it may allow for lower regeneration temperatures, potentially improving catalytic performance by preventing overoxidation and maintaining catalyst dispersion.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. Reduction of active Cr3+ species to inactive Cr2+ species

Various regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. CO2 addition:
- Helps maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state
- Can eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase
- Has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamic stability
- Does not significantly decrease selectivity
- More effective when promoted by Ni, which enhances CO2's ability to reoxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+

2. O2 addition:
- Improves oxidizing power when used as a co-feed with CO2
- Decreases the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts
- However, significantly decreases the selectivity for propylene (C3H6)

3. Ni promotion with CO2:
- Enhances CO2 conversion
- Maintains stable production of propylene
- Dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads
- Regenerates reduced Cr2+ species to Cr3+ through reoxidation
- Maintains stable catalytic activity

The literature does not provide specific information on air regeneration, temperature requirements for these methods, or their impact on VOx-catalyzed reactions. The addition of Ni as a promoter in combination with CO2 appears to be the most effective method for maintaining catalytic performance and mitigating deactivation in Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include thermal cracking reactions leading to coke formation and the production of light alkanes. These processes result in decreased product yield and increased catalyst deactivation.

          Regarding regeneration methods:

          1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of both Cr and V species during the reaction. It keeps the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2. This method is effective at the reaction temperature and does not require additional heating.

          2. Reoxidation with air or O2: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, these are common methods for regenerating reduced metal oxide catalysts. They would likely be more effective than CO2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst but may require higher temperatures and could potentially lead to overoxidation.

          Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it's noted that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K for C3 and C4 alkanes) help maintain vanadium oxide in higher oxidation states, suggesting that regeneration temperatures should be carefully controlled to balance effective reoxidation with prevention of thermal degradation.

          Overall, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for maintaining catalyst activity and potentially extending catalyst lifetime, while also promoting the desired dehydrogenation reactions and mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The literature primarily focuses on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of deactivation causes and regeneration methods for different metal oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

   - It suppresses catalyst deactivation
   - It helps maintain the catalyst surface in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation

3. Effectiveness: CO2 addition was found to be effective in suppressing deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, resulting in a slower decrease in C3H6 yield compared to reactions without CO2.

4. Temperature: The experiments were conducted at 823 K (550°C), but the study doesn't compare this to other temperatures or regeneration methods.

The extent of coke formation varies with the oxidant used, being highest in direct dehydrogenation and lowest with O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures.

2. Changes in the oxidation state of chromium species: This is a reversible process that can affect catalyst performance. The oxidation state depends on the oxidant used, with CO2 resulting in Cr2+ species and O2 (alone or with CO2) resulting in Cr3+ species.

3. Aggregation of metal species: This can occur during reactions, particularly when O2 is used as an oxidant.

4. Textural changes: Different textural features of the catalysts can influence their susceptibility to deactivation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This method is effective in removing coke, reversing Cr species aggregation, and restoring catalyst activity. The temperature typically used is around 873 K for at least 6 hours.

2. Using CO2 as an oxidant: This approach reduces coke formation compared to direct dehydrogenation and maintains Cr in a lower oxidation state (Cr2+).

3. O2 or O2+CO2 mixtures: These are most effective in reducing coke formation during the reaction and maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state (Cr3+).

The effectiveness of these methods varies, with O2-based regeneration seeming most effective at reversing deactivation. However, using CO2 as an oxidant or in combination with O2 shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and potentially improving selectivity. All regeneration methods were effective in preventing irreversible deactivation, allowing the catalysts to maintain their performance over multiple runs.

The study does not provide specific information about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Coke formation: This is the main cause, evidenced by carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, observed through Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts.

2. Reduction of active metal species: The catalysts become progressively reduced during the reaction, leading to a decline in activity.

3. Structural rearrangement: High temperatures during reaction or regeneration can cause changes in the oxide structure.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This method is effective for removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The process is most intense during the first 8-10 minutes, with CO2 and minor amounts of CO being formed. After about 15 minutes, the formation of these compounds becomes negligible, indicating that the regeneration process is complete.

2. Temperature requirements: Higher temperatures are generally needed for complete regeneration, but this risks further structural changes to the catalyst. The literature mentions a temperature of 550°C for the reoxidation process.

3. Effectiveness: While regeneration is generally effective, there may be some drawbacks:
   - Incomplete reoxidation of reduced vanadium species
   - Incomplete removal of coke
   - Possible rearrangement of the V oxide structure due to the highly exothermal oxidation treatment

4. CO2 regeneration: While not explicitly mentioned for these catalysts, CO2 could potentially offer milder oxidation conditions, potentially reducing overoxidation issues.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not directly addressed in the provided information. However, using CO2 as a milder oxidant could potentially help balance the need for reoxidation with the risk of overoxidation and structural damage associated with more aggressive oxidants like O2.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods have been studied to address these issues:

1. Reoxidation with air or CO2: This method is widely applied at high temperatures (550-650°C) and can recover most of the activity and selectivity.

2. Regeneration with O2: For CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore activity, with this recovery being repeatable for at least 4 cycles.

3. Regeneration with CO2: While effective for complete recovery in the second cycle, it cannot prevent further deactivation in subsequent cycles. For VOx catalysts, CO2 cannot fully reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5 but can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4.

4. Co-feeding O2 during CO2ODHP: This approach promotes coke removal during the reaction but leads to a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2-C3 olefin selectivity.

In terms of effectiveness, O2 regeneration appears to be the most efficient for Cr-based catalysts, offering complete and repeatable recovery. The temperature requirements for these regeneration methods are generally in the range of 550-650°C.

For VOx-catalyzed reactions, adding CO2 to the feed gas of C3H8/O2 has shown promise in mitigating overoxidation. This approach decreases surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites, potentially improving selectivity towards desired products.

The impact on catalytic performance varies depending on the regeneration method. While most methods can restore activity and selectivity, there are trade-offs. For instance, co-feeding O2 during the reaction removes coke but reduces selectivity. The choice of regeneration method depends on the specific catalyst system and the desired balance between activity recovery and product selectivity.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the ability of the catalyst surface to reoxidize becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs, especially during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The extent of carbon deposition varies with vanadium content, with catalysts having near-monolayer coverage showing higher weight losses during TGA. This carbon deposition is associated with higher catalytic activity.

3. Reduction of VOx species: During the reaction, VOx species are reduced, as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of Raman peaks associated with V=O stretching modes.

4. Presence of promoters: The addition of Na+ adversely affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, preventing the regeneration of the catalytically active V5+ oxidation state necessary for propane activation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as evidenced by the weight loss observed during TGA in air for used catalysts.

2. O2 ODH results in very little carbon deposition compared to CO2 ODH, suggesting that O2 may be more effective at preventing carbon buildup during the reaction.

3. CO2 as an oxidant leads to more carbon deposition than O2, but it may help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions due to its milder oxidizing nature.

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods likely depends on the extent of carbon deposition and the degree of VOx reduction. Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the TGA analysis suggests that air treatment at elevated temperatures can remove carbon deposits. The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration is not directly addressed in the provided information.

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation discussed in this literature is carbon deposition or coking on the catalyst surface, particularly observed for Ga2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This deactivation occurs rapidly, with significant performance decrease after just 1 hour of reaction time.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature only discusses the use of CO2 for regeneration. It suggests that CO2 can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. However, the effectiveness of this method appears limited, as the amount of CO produced (indicating carbon removal) decreases with repeated pulses of CO2.

The literature does not provide information on regeneration using air or O2, nor does it compare different regeneration methods in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation is not directly addressed for VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the study shows that for Ga2O3 catalysts, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation due to coking during continuous operation.

It's important to note that this literature focuses primarily on Ga2O3 catalysts rather than Cr-based or VOx catalysts, so the information may not be directly applicable to those systems. The study also indicates that high temperatures accelerate coke formation, which is exacerbated by the presence of acid sites on the catalyst.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface.
2. Aggregation of active species: The decreased dispersion of Cr species due to sintering or clustering.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 regeneration: Performed at 496 ± 3°C for 3 hours. This method was not fully effective in recovering catalyst activity.
2. Air regeneration: Conducted at 500°C. This method also failed to fully restore the initial catalyst activity.

Both regeneration methods showed limited effectiveness in recovering the catalyst's original performance. The temperature requirements for both methods were similar, around 500°C.

The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration was negative, as neither method could fully restore the initial activity. This suggests that the deactivation caused by aggregation of Cr species is not easily reversed by these regeneration processes.

The provided information does not include specific details about VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, these aspects cannot be addressed based on the given information.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for both Cr-based and VOx catalysts.
2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion can cause chromia to incorporate into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.
3. Reduction of active species: The hydrocarbon feed can reduce the active metal oxide species (e.g., Mo6+ to lower oxidation states, Fe2O3 to Fe3O4), potentially altering their catalytic activity.
4. Strong adsorption of reactants on active sites.
5. Sintering of metal oxide species, forming larger crystallites or mixed oxides (e.g., V2O5 crystallites or AlVO4).

Regeneration methods and their comparison:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2:
- Most common and effective method for removing coke deposits
- Can restore activity but may lead to gradual irreversible deactivation, especially for Cr-based catalysts
- High temperatures (e.g., 600°C for V2O5) can cause thermal stress and sintering

2. CO2 addition:
- Acts as a milder oxidant, increasing alkene yields
- Helps reduce coke formation through the Boudouart reaction
- Assists in product desorption
- Oxidizes overly reduced vanadium centers
- Removes hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions
- Can be effective at lower temperatures and during the reaction itself

3. Steam addition:
- Similar to CO2, helps reduce coke deposition
- Assists in product desorption

4. Hydrogen addition:
- Can help control coke formation

Temperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to or slightly higher than reaction temperatures. Lower temperatures are preferred to minimize thermal stress and sintering, but must be high enough to effectively remove coke.

Impact on catalytic performance:

- Air regeneration can restore most of the initial activity but may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over multiple cycles.
- CO2 and steam addition can improve catalyst stability and olefin yield, but may also competitively adsorb on active sites.
- The use of promoters (e.g., MgO, K) can enhance catalyst stability and reduce coke formation.

Overall, while these regeneration methods can effectively remove coke and restore some activity, they may not fully address all forms of deactivation, particularly the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts. Balancing the regeneration conditions to maximize coke removal while minimizing irreversible deactivation is crucial for maintaining long-term catalytic performance. The use of CO2 or steam as mild oxidants shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and mitigating some deactivation mechanisms, particularly for VOx catalysts where overoxidation is a concern.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Formation of bulk V2O5, which decreases selectivity and favors total oxidation.
2. Clustering of VOx species during reaction.
3. Surface carbon formation (coking).
4. Reduction of active metal oxide species (e.g., V2O5 to V2O3).

Regeneration methods comparison:

1. Reoxidation with O2: Most effective, capable of fully oxidizing V2O3 back to V2O5. However, this can lead to overoxidation and formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. Reoxidation with CO2: Less aggressive, oxidizing V2O3 only to V2O4. This partial reoxidation helps maintain catalyst selectivity by preventing overoxidation. CO2 regenerates about 45% of the exchangeable oxygen compared to O2.

3. Reoxidation with air: Not explicitly discussed in the given text, but likely similar to O2, though possibly less intense due to dilution with nitrogen.

CO2 addition impacts on catalytic performance:

1. Participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. Suppresses surface carbon formation, with carbon deposition being three times less when CO2 is present in the reaction mixture.
3. Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by only partially reoxidizing the catalyst (to V2O4 instead of V2O5), potentially maintaining better selectivity.
4. Allows for lower reaction temperatures.

The addition of WOx to VOx catalysts improves performance by hindering the clustering of VOx species during reaction and acting as a physical barrier between VOx species.

While specific temperature requirements are not mentioned, the effectiveness of CO2 as a milder oxidant compared to O2 suggests it may allow for lower regeneration temperatures, potentially improving catalytic performance by preventing overoxidation and maintaining catalyst dispersion.
