[1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[3] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[4] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[5] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[6] "By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."

[7] "Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[8] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

[1] "The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

          [2] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity"

          [3] "As regards the promoting effect of CO2, the reverse water gas shift reaction (6) and the Boudouard reaction (7) may play positive roles in the dehydrogenation reaction:
          CO2 + H2 CO + H2O,
          (6)
          C + CO2 CO.
          (7)"

          [4] "Reaction (6) transforms H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O and shifts the reactions (2), (3), and (4) to the product side, lead-ing to the enhancement of the total reaction rate. Meanwhile, reaction (7) removes the carbon deposit from the catalyst surface and improves the stability of the catalyst."

[1] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."

[2] "It should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-stream."

[3] "The produced propene can be a precursor of inactive coke deposited on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Taking into account the catalytic role of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the conversion of propane it should therefore be concluded that the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."

[5] "Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."

[6] "The cracking process is commonly catalyzed by acidic surface sites. Therefore, it could be suspected that during the reaction acid sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed."

[7] "Apart from the decomposition of active centers, a formation of carbonaceous deposit encapsulating the active phase of chromium oxide can be a reason of the catalyst deactivation."

[8] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

"Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking [29]."

"The presence of Brnsted acid sites is of interest in the elucidation of the surface properties of the investigated catalysts, because, as reported in the literature devoted to paraffin dehydrogenation processes [29] these centres can promote the further transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

"Before the reaction all catalysts were activated in air flow at T = 600 C for at least 2 h. After the experiment catalysts were regenerated in air flow at T = 600 C for 6 h."

"The initial conversion of propane on the 0.5-Cr/SiO2-MVS catalyst was ca. 42%, than in 400 min decreased till ca. 28% and then remained stable for the next 400 min"

"Conversely, catalysts based on Cr are among the more effective, and the optimisation of their behavior is still a target to be attained. In this respect, a basic point is represented by the achievement of a high dispersion of chromium, as isolated/oligomeric CrOx species are supposed to exhibit the highest catalytic activity."

"Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content"

[1] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields."

          [2] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

          [3] "The peak of Cr6+ after dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 slightly strengthened as compared to that reacted in the presence of Ar. This result indicates that the chromium oxide could sustain a higher oxidation state."

          [4] "However, the V5+ peak of 400 nm in the presence of Ar was slightly weaker than that in the presence of CO2. This result indicated that CO2 slightly oxidized vanadium species during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

          [5] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

[1] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[2] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

[4] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[5] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

"All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."

"The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."

"TGA data (Fig. 7) indicated that the weight loss assignable to coke removal by heating in air decreased from ca. 3 wt% for the catalyst tested in direct hydrogenation (curve a) to ca. 2 wt% when it was used for ODH in the presence of CO2 (curve b), and to ca. 1-0.5 wt% when the oxidant for ODH was O2 or the O2+CO2 mixture (curves c,d, respectively)."

"Thereby, the in situ XANES measurements provided evidence that during direct dehydrogenation or ODH in the presence of CO2 the active chromium species are in average in the +2 oxidation state, whereas when O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

"The aggregation of Cr species under reaction condition was proposed to occur in propane ODH with O2 as oxidant, then reversed by subsequent catalyst reactivation in oxygen."

"The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts as discussed in this literature, is coke formation. This is evidenced by the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, as observed through Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts."

"This indicates the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface."

"Further evidence of the formation of coke under anaerobic conditions was provided by the Raman spectra of spent catalysts (i.e., analyzed after the reducing step). Typical Raman features associated with the presence of coke were observed (Fig. 13)."

"The hypothesis of coke accumulation on the catalyst during anaerobic operation is supported by various experimental evidence"

"Reduction of the active metal species: The catalysts become progressively reduced during reaction, leading to a decline in activity."

"Structural rearrangement: High temperatures during reaction or regeneration can cause changes in the oxide structure."

[1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."

[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."

[3] "For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."

[4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."

[5] "Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."

[6] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorptiondesorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."

[7] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."

"These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

"All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

"Recently, Ascoop et al17 also reported significant carbon deposition even after a short time on stream during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

"The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation."

"The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."

"These observed differences in carbon deposition behavior may be related to catalytic activity, since the catalysts showing higher reactivity in CO2 ODH of propane displayed greater carbon deposition."

"The Raman peaks at 993 and 1033 cm1 decreased in intensity due to reduction of VOx species during the reaction, which represent the stretching mode of monomeric V=O species, while new peaks were observed at 1350 and 1598 cm1 that correspond to the D and G bands of carbon."

[1] "Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]."

[2] "TGA analysis showed 3% increase in the mass of the Ga2O3 catalyst after 4 h reaction period. These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "The carbon deposition is one of the major problems in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3. Coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of acid sites on the catalyst."

[4] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide. However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number. These results suggest that CO2 can remove the carbon deposit by the Boudouard reaction (4)."

[1] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream."

[2] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."

[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered as shown in Fig. S4."

[4] "We also regenerated the sample in air at 500 C, but the initial activity of the catalyst was still not fully recovered."

[5] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."

"Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

"The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."

"Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species."

"Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

"Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

"CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

"Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."

"The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction."

"In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction."

"CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

"The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

"The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation."

"The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."

[1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

"Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."

"The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction."

"In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction."

"CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

"The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

"The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation."

"The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."
