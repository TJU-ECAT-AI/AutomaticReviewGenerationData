Hydrogen addition:\n- Can help control coke formation\n\nTemperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to or slightly higher than reaction temperatures. Lower temperatures are preferred to minimize thermal stress and sintering, but must be high enough to effectively remove coke.\n\nImpact on catalytic performance:\n\n- Air regeneration can restore most of the initial activity but may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over multiple cycles.\n- CO2 and steam addition can improve catalyst stability and olefin yield, but may also competitively adsorb on active sites.\n- The use of promoters (e.g., MgO, K) can enhance catalyst stability and reduce coke formation.\n\nOverall, while these regeneration methods can effectively remove coke and restore some activity, they may not fully address all forms of deactivation, particularly the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts. Balancing the regeneration conditions to maximize coke removal while minimizing irreversible deactivation is crucial for maintaining long-term catalytic performance.
