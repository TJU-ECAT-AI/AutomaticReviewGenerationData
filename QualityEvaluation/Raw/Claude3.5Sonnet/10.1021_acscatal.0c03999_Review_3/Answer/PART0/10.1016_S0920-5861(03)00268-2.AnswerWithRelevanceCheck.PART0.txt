          [1] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields."

          [2] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

          [3] "The peak of Cr6+ after dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 slightly strengthened as compared to that reacted in the presence of Ar. This result indicates that the chromium oxide could sustain a higher oxidation state."

          [4] "However, the V5+ peak of 400 nm in the presence of Ar was slightly weaker than that in the presence of CO2. This result indicated that CO2 slightly oxidized vanadium species during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

          [5] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

          1. Coke formation: The produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has a lower bond dissociation energy than the starting alkanes. This leads to faster hydrogen abstraction from the allylic position, resulting in coke precursors and catalyst deactivation.

          2. Reduction of metal oxides: During the reaction, the metal oxides (Cr and V species) can be reduced from their higher oxidation states, decreasing their catalytic activity.

          Regarding regeneration methods:

          1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of both Cr and V species during the reaction. It keeps the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2. This method is effective at the reaction temperature and does not require additional heating.

          2. Reoxidation with air or O2: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, these are common methods for regenerating reduced metal oxide catalysts. They would likely be more effective than CO2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst but may require higher temperatures and could potentially lead to overoxidation.

          The impact of CO2 addition on catalytic performance includes:

          1. Maintaining catalyst activity: By keeping the metal oxides in a higher oxidation state, CO2 helps maintain catalyst activity over time.

          2. Mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions: The ability of CO2 to maintain a slightly higher oxidation state without fully oxidizing the catalyst suggests it could help balance the oxidation state and potentially mitigate overoxidation.

          3. Promoting dehydrogenation: The presence of CO2 was shown to increase alkene yields in several cases, particularly for propane dehydrogenation.

          Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it's noted that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K for C3 and C4 alkanes) help maintain vanadium oxide in higher oxidation states, suggesting that regeneration temperatures should be carefully controlled to balance effective reoxidation with prevention of thermal degradation.

          Overall, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for maintaining catalyst activity and potentially extending catalyst lifetime, while also promoting the desired dehydrogenation reactions and mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

          1. 结焦形成：生成的烯烃含有烯丙基氢，其键解离能比起始烷烃低。这导致烯丙基位置的氢更快被抽取，形成结焦前体，使催化剂失活。

          2. 金属氧化物还原：在反应过程中，金属氧化物（Cr和V物种）可能从较高的氧化态被还原，降低其催化活性。

          关于再生方法：

          1. 添加CO2：CO2在反应过程中能有效地维持Cr和V物种的较高氧化态。与无CO2反应相比，它使表面V2O5和Cr2O3保持在略高的氧化态。这种方法在反应温度下有效，不需要额外加热。

          2. 用空气或O2再氧化：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但这些是再生还原金属氧化物催化剂的常用方法。它们在完全再氧化催化剂方面可能比CO2更有效，但可能需要更高的温度，并可能导致过度氧化。

          CO2添加对催化性能的影响包括：

          1. 保持催化剂活性：通过将金属氧化物保持在较高的氧化态，CO2有助于长期保持催化剂活性。

          2. 减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化：CO2能够维持略高的氧化态而不完全氧化催化剂，这表明它可能有助于平衡氧化态，潜在地减轻过度氧化。

          3. 促进脱氢：在多个案例中，CO2的存在被证明可以增加烯烃产率，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中。

          文本中未明确说明再生的温度要求。然而，值得注意的是，较低的反应温度（C3和C4烷烃低于893 K）有助于保持钒氧化物处于较高的氧化态，这表明应该仔细控制再生温度，以平衡有效的再氧化和防止热降解。

          总的来说，添加CO2似乎是一种有效的方法，可以维持催化剂活性，可能延长催化剂寿命，同时还能促进所需的脱氢反应，并减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。
