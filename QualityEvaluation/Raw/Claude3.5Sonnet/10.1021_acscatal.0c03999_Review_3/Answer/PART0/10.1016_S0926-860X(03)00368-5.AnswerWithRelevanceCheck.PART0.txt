          [1] "Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]."

[2] "TGA analysis showed 3% increase in the mass of the Ga2O3 catalyst after 4 h reaction period. These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "The carbon deposition is one of the major problems in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3. Coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of acid sites on the catalyst."

[4] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide. However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number. These results suggest that CO2 can remove the carbon deposit by the Boudouard reaction (4)."

          The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation discussed in this literature is carbon deposition or coking on the catalyst surface, particularly observed for Ga2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This deactivation occurs rapidly, with significant performance decrease after just 1 hour of reaction time.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature only discusses the use of CO2 for regeneration. It suggests that CO2 can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction. However, the effectiveness of this method appears limited, as the amount of CO produced (indicating carbon removal) decreases with repeated pulses of CO2.

The literature does not provide information on regeneration using air or O2, nor does it compare different regeneration methods in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation is not directly addressed for VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the study shows that for Ga2O3 catalysts, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation due to coking during continuous operation.

It's important to note that this literature focuses primarily on Ga2O3 catalysts rather than Cr-based or VOx catalysts, so the information may not be directly applicable to those systems. The study also indicates that high temperatures accelerate coke formation, which is exacerbated by the presence of acid sites on the catalyst.

          这篇文献讨论的金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面的碳沉积或结焦，这种现象在丙烷脱氢反应中的Ga2O3催化剂上特别明显。这种失活发生得很快，在反应1小时后就观察到显著的性能下降。

关于再生方法，文献只讨论了使用CO2进行再生。它表明CO2可以通过Boudouard反应去除碳沉积物。然而，这种方法的效果似乎有限，因为随着重复使用CO2脉冲，产生的CO量（表示碳的去除）逐渐减少。

文献没有提供使用空气或O2进行再生的信息，也没有比较不同再生方法在有效性、温度要求或对催化性能影响方面的差异。

文献没有直接讨论CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的缓解潜力。然而，研究表明，对于Ga2O3催化剂，CO2在连续操作过程中并不能抑制由于结焦导致的快速失活。

需要注意的是，这篇文献主要关注Ga2O3催化剂，而不是基于Cr或VOx的催化剂，因此这些信息可能不直接适用于那些体系。研究还表明，高温加速了焦炭形成，这种情况在催化剂上存在酸性位点时会更加严重。
