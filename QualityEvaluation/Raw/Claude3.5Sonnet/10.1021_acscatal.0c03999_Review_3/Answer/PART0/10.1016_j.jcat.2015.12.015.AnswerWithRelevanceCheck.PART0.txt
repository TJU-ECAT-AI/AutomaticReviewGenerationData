          "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

"The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

"The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation."

"The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Formation of bulk V2O5, which decreases selectivity and favors total oxidation.
2. Clustering of VOx species during reaction.
3. Surface carbon formation (coking).
4. Reduction of active metal oxide species (e.g., V2O5 to V2O3).

Regeneration methods comparison:

1. Reoxidation with O2: Most effective, capable of fully oxidizing V2O3 back to V2O5. However, this can lead to overoxidation and formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. Reoxidation with CO2: Less aggressive, oxidizing V2O3 only to V2O4. This partial reoxidation helps maintain catalyst selectivity by preventing overoxidation. CO2 regenerates about 45% of the exchangeable oxygen compared to O2.

3. Reoxidation with air: Not explicitly discussed in the given text, but likely similar to O2, though possibly less intense due to dilution with nitrogen.

CO2 addition impacts on catalytic performance:

1. Participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. Suppresses surface carbon formation, with carbon deposition being three times less when CO2 is present in the reaction mixture.
3. Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by only partially reoxidizing the catalyst (to V2O4 instead of V2O5), potentially maintaining better selectivity.
4. Allows for lower reaction temperatures.

The addition of WOx to VOx catalysts improves performance by hindering the clustering of VOx species during reaction and acting as a physical barrier between VOx species.

While specific temperature requirements are not mentioned, the effectiveness of CO2 as a milder oxidant compared to O2 suggests it may allow for lower regeneration temperatures, potentially improving catalytic performance by preventing overoxidation and maintaining catalyst dispersion.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 形成大块V2O5，降低选择性并有利于完全氧化。
2. 反应过程中VOx物种的聚集。
3. 表面碳形成（结焦）。
4. 活性金属氧化物物种的还原（例如，V2O5还原为V2O3）。

再生方法比较：

1. 用O2再氧化：最有效，能够将V2O3完全氧化回V2O5。然而，这可能导致过度氧化和非选择性氧物种的形成。

2. 用CO2再氧化：较为温和，仅将V2O3氧化至V2O4。这种部分再氧化有助于通过防止过度氧化来维持催化剂的选择性。与O2相比，CO2再生约45%的可交换氧。

3. 用空气再氧化：在给定的文本中没有明确讨论，但可能与O2相似，尽管由于与氮气的稀释，强度可能较低。

CO2添加对催化性能的影响：

1. 参与了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。
2. 抑制表面碳的形成，当反应混合物中存在CO2时，碳沉积量减少了三倍。
3. 通过仅部分再氧化催化剂（到V2O4而不是V2O5）来缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，可能保持更好的选择性。
4. 允许较低的反应温度。

将WOx添加到VOx催化剂中可以通过抑制反应过程中VOx物种的聚集和在VOx物种之间充当物理屏障来改善性能。

虽然没有提到具体的温度要求，但CO2作为比O2更温和的氧化剂的有效性表明，它可能允许较低的再生温度，通过防止过度氧化和维持催化剂分散性，可能改善催化性能。
