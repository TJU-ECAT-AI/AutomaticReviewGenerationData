          "The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts as discussed in this literature, is coke formation. This is evidenced by the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, as observed through Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts."

"This indicates the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface."

"Further evidence of the formation of coke under anaerobic conditions was provided by the Raman spectra of spent catalysts (i.e., analyzed after the reducing step). Typical Raman features associated with the presence of coke were observed (Fig. 13)."

"The hypothesis of coke accumulation on the catalyst during anaerobic operation is supported by various experimental evidence"

"Reduction of the active metal species: The catalysts become progressively reduced during reaction, leading to a decline in activity."

"Structural rearrangement: High temperatures during reaction or regeneration can cause changes in the oxide structure."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Coke formation: This is the main cause, evidenced by carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, observed through Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts.

2. Reduction of active metal species: The catalysts become progressively reduced during the reaction, leading to a decline in activity.

3. Structural rearrangement: High temperatures during reaction or regeneration can cause changes in the oxide structure.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This method is effective for removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The process is most intense during the first 8-10 minutes, with CO2 and minor amounts of CO being formed. After about 15 minutes, the formation of these compounds becomes negligible, indicating that the regeneration process is complete.

2. Temperature requirements: Higher temperatures are generally needed for complete regeneration, but this risks further structural changes to the catalyst. The literature mentions a temperature of 550°C for the reoxidation process.

3. Effectiveness: While regeneration is generally effective, there may be some drawbacks:
   - Incomplete reoxidation of reduced vanadium species
   - Incomplete removal of coke
   - Possible rearrangement of the V oxide structure due to the highly exothermal oxidation treatment

4. CO2 regeneration: While not explicitly mentioned for these catalysts, CO2 could potentially offer milder oxidation conditions, potentially reducing overoxidation issues.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not directly addressed in the provided information. However, using CO2 as a milder oxidant could potentially help balance the need for reoxidation with the risk of overoxidation and structural damage associated with more aggressive oxidants like O2.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（主要关注VOx催化剂）失活的主要原因有：

1. 积碳形成：这是主要原因，通过拉曼光谱观察到的使用过的催化剂表面的碳质沉积物证实了这一点。

2. 活性金属物种的还原：催化剂在反应过程中逐渐被还原，导致活性下降。

3. 结构重排：反应或再生过程中的高温可能导致氧化物结构发生变化。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：这种方法在去除积碳和恢复催化剂活性方面是有效的。再氧化过程在前8-10分钟最为强烈，会形成CO2和少量CO。约15分钟后，这些化合物的形成变得可以忽略不计，表明再生过程已经完成。

2. 温度要求：完全再生通常需要较高的温度，但这会增加催化剂进一步结构变化的风险。文献提到再氧化过程的温度为550°C。

3. 有效性：虽然再生通常是有效的，但可能存在一些缺点：
   - 还原的钒物种可能未完全再氧化
   - 积碳可能未完全去除
   - 由于高度放热的氧化处理，V氧化物结构可能会发生重排

4. CO2再生：虽然文中没有明确提到这些催化剂的CO2再生，但CO2可能提供更温和的氧化条件，潜在地减少过度氧化问题。

文中没有直接讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。然而，使用CO2作为更温和的氧化剂可能有助于平衡再氧化的需求与更具侵略性的氧化剂（如O2）相关的过度氧化和结构损害风险。
