"Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated."

"The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."

"Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species."

"Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

"Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

"CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

"Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."

"The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction."

"In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Coke deposition: This is the main cause of activity loss for both Cr-based and VOx catalysts.
2. Incorporation of active species into the support: For Cr-based catalysts, the heat released during coke combustion can cause chromia to incorporate into the alumina framework, reducing the amount of catalytically active Cr species.
3. Reduction of active species: The hydrocarbon feed can reduce the active metal oxide species (e.g., Mo6+ to lower oxidation states, Fe2O3 to Fe3O4), potentially altering their catalytic activity.
4. Strong adsorption of reactants on active sites.
5. Sintering of metal oxide species, forming larger crystallites or mixed oxides (e.g., V2O5 crystallites or AlVO4).

Regeneration methods and their comparison:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2:
- Most common and effective method for removing coke deposits
- Can restore activity but may lead to gradual irreversible deactivation, especially for Cr-based catalysts
- High temperatures (e.g., 600°C for V2O5) can cause thermal stress and sintering

2. CO2 addition:
- Acts as a milder oxidant, increasing alkene yields
- Helps reduce coke formation through the Boudouart reaction
- Assists in product desorption
- Oxidizes overly reduced vanadium centers
- Removes hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Mitigates overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions
- Can be effective at lower temperatures and during the reaction itself

3. Steam addition:
- Similar to CO2, helps reduce coke deposition
- Assists in product desorption

4. Hydrogen addition:
- Can help control coke formation

Temperature requirements for regeneration are typically similar to or slightly higher than reaction temperatures. Lower temperatures are preferred to minimize thermal stress and sintering, but must be high enough to effectively remove coke.

Impact on catalytic performance:

- Air regeneration can restore most of the initial activity but may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over multiple cycles.
- CO2 and steam addition can improve catalyst stability and olefin yield, but may also competitively adsorb on active sites.
- The use of promoters (e.g., MgO, K) can enhance catalyst stability and reduce coke formation.

Overall, while these regeneration methods can effectively remove coke and restore some activity, they may not fully address all forms of deactivation, particularly the incorporation of active species into the support for Cr-based catalysts. Balancing the regeneration conditions to maximize coke removal while minimizing irreversible deactivation is crucial for maintaining long-term catalytic performance. The use of CO2 or steam as mild oxidants shows promise in maintaining catalyst performance and mitigating some deactivation mechanisms, particularly for VOx catalysts where overoxidation is a concern.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 积碳沉积：这是Cr基和VOx催化剂活性损失的主要原因。
2. 活性物种进入载体：对于Cr基催化剂，焦炭燃烧释放的热量可能导致氧化铬进入氧化铝骨架，减少催化活性Cr物种的数量。
3. 活性物种的还原：烃类原料可以将活性金属氧化物物种还原（例如，Mo6+还原为低价态，Fe2O3还原为Fe3O4），可能改变其催化活性。
4. 反应物在活性位上的强吸附。
5. 金属氧化物物种的烧结，形成更大的晶体或混合氧化物（如V2O5晶体或AlVO4）。

再生方法及其比较：

1. 空气或O2再氧化：
- 最常见和有效的去除积碳沉积物的方法
- 可以恢复活性，但可能导致逐渐的不可逆失活，特别是对于Cr基催化剂
- 高温（例如，V2O5需600°C）可能导致热应力和烧结

2. CO2添加：
- 作为较温和的氧化剂，增加烯烃产率
- 通过Boudouart反应帮助减少积碳形成
- 辅助产物脱附
- 氧化过度还原的钒中心
- 通过逆水气变换反应去除氢气
- 减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化
- 可在较低温度下和反应过程中有效

3. 蒸汽添加：
- 类似于CO2，有助于减少积碳沉积
- 辅助产物脱附

4. 氢气添加：
- 可以帮助控制积碳形成

再生所需的温度通常与反应温度相似或略高。为了最大限度地减少热应力和烧结，首选较低的温度，但必须足够高以有效去除积碳。

对催化性能的影响：

- 空气再生可以恢复大部分初始活性，但可能导致多个循环后活性位点逐渐损失。
- CO2和蒸汽的添加可以提高催化剂稳定性和烯烃产率，但也可能在活性位点上竞争吸附。
- 使用促进剂（如MgO，K）可以增强催化剂稳定性并减少积碳形成。

总的来说，虽然这些再生方法能有效去除积碳并恢复部分活性，但它们可能无法完全解决所有形式的失活，特别是Cr基催化剂中活性物种进入载体的问题。平衡再生条件以最大化焦炭去除同时最小化不可逆失活对维持长期催化性能至关重要。使用CO2或蒸汽作为温和氧化剂显示出在维持催化剂性能和减轻某些失活机制方面的潜力，特别是对于VOx催化剂，其中过度氧化是一个问题。
