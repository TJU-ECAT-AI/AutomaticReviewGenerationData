          [1] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[2] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

[4] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

[5] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

          The literature primarily focuses on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of deactivation causes and regeneration methods for different metal oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The main cause appears to be reduction of the metal oxide surface during the dehydrogenation reaction. This is evidenced by the observation that a partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst is more active than a reduced one.

2. Regeneration method - CO2 addition: The study demonstrates that CO2 addition has a positive effect on catalyst performance and longevity:
   - It enhances the yield of C3H6 (propylene)
   - It suppresses catalyst deactivation
   - It helps maintain the catalyst surface in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation

3. Effectiveness: CO2 addition was found to be effective in suppressing deactivation for Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, resulting in a slower decrease in C3H6 yield compared to reactions without CO2.

4. Temperature: The experiments were conducted at 823 K (550°C), but the study doesn't compare this to other temperatures or regeneration methods.

5. Impact on catalytic performance: CO2 addition improved both initial activity and long-term stability of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

The study does not provide information on VOx catalysts or other regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air or O2. It also doesn't discuss the potential of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. To fully answer the question, additional research on these aspects would be necessary.

          这篇文献主要关注Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用，而非对不同金属氧化物催化剂的失活原因和再生方法进行全面比较。然而，我们可以从所提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 催化剂失活：主要原因似乎是脱氢反应过程中金属氧化物表面的还原。这一点从部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比还原态催化剂更活跃的观察结果中得到证实。

2. 再生方法 - CO2添加：研究表明，添加CO2对催化剂性能和寿命有积极影响：
   - 提高了C3H6（丙烯）的产率
   - 抑制了催化剂失活
   - 有助于保持催化剂表面处于部分氧化状态，这对丙烷脱氢更加活跃

3. 有效性：研究发现，对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，CO2添加在抑制失活方面是有效的，与无CO2的反应相比，C3H6产率降低得更慢。

4. 温度：实验在823 K（550°C）下进行，但研究没有将此与其他温度或再生方法进行比较。

5. 对催化性能的影响：添加CO2提高了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的初始活性和长期稳定性。

这项研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂或其他再生方法（如用空气或O2再氧化）的信息。它也没有讨论CO2在VOx催化反应中减缓过度氧化的潜力。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对这些方面进行额外的研究。
