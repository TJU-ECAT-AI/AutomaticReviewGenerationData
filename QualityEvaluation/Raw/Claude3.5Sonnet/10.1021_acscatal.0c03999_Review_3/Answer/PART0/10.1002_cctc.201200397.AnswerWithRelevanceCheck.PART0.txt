          [1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[3] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[4] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[5] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[6] "By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."

[7] "Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[8] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. Reduction of active Cr3+ species to inactive Cr2+ species

Various regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. CO2 addition:
- Helps maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state
- Can eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase
- Has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamic stability
- Does not significantly decrease selectivity
- More effective when promoted by Ni, which enhances CO2's ability to reoxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+

2. O2 addition:
- Improves oxidizing power when used as a co-feed with CO2
- Decreases the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts
- However, significantly decreases the selectivity for propylene (C3H6)

3. Ni promotion with CO2:
- Enhances CO2 conversion
- Maintains stable production of propylene
- Dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads
- Regenerates reduced Cr2+ species to Cr3+ through reoxidation
- Maintains stable catalytic activity

The literature does not provide specific information on air regeneration, temperature requirements for these methods, or their impact on VOx-catalyzed reactions. The addition of Ni as a promoter in combination with CO2 appears to be the most effective method for maintaining catalytic performance and mitigating deactivation in Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对基于铬的催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳沉积
2. 活性Cr3+物种还原为无活性Cr2+物种

各种再生方法及其有效性：

1. CO2添加：
- 有助于将Cr维持在较高的氧化态
- 可以消除积碳沉积并再氧化还原的活性相
- 由于其热力学稳定性，氧化能力有限
- 不会显著降低选择性
- 当用镍促进时更有效，镍增强了CO2将Cr2+再氧化为Cr3+以及Cr3+再氧化为Cr6+的能力

2. O2添加：
- 作为CO2的共进料时可以提高氧化能力
- 降低CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂的失活速率
- 然而，显著降低了对丙烯（C3H6）的选择性

3. 镍促进剂与CO2结合：
- 提高CO2转化率
- 保持丙烯的稳定产量
- 将CO2分解为CO和O*ads
- 通过再氧化将还原的Cr2+物种重新生成为Cr3+
- 保持稳定的催化活性

文献没有提供关于空气再生、这些方法的温度要求或它们对VOx催化反应的影响的具体信息。在铬基催化剂的氧化脱氢过程中，添加镍作为促进剂并结合CO2似乎是保持催化性能和减缓失活最有效的方法。
