Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, regeneration methods, or the effects of CO2 addition in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The document appears to be only a title and author information for a manuscript about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over alumina-supported vanadia catalyst, with mention of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additive effects. Without access to the full text, it is not possible to answer the detailed questions about catalyst deactivation, regeneration methods, and CO2 effects based solely on this limited information.

给出的文献并不包含具体涉及金属氧化物催化剂失活原因、再生方法或二氧化碳添加在氧化脱氢过程中的影响等信息。该文件似乎只是一份关于氧化铝负载钒氧化物催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢的手稿的标题和作者信息,其中提到了二氧化碳和次级表面金属氧化物添加剂的影响。在没有获得全文的情况下,仅凭这些有限的信息无法回答有关催化剂失活、再生方法和二氧化碳效应的详细问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information directly relevant to answering the question about metal oxide catalyst deactivation, regeneration methods, or CO2 addition in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The title and author information provided do not offer sufficient details to address the specific aspects of catalyst deactivation, regeneration techniques, or the effects of CO2 on VOx-catalyzed reactions. To properly answer this question, additional information or a more comprehensive literature source would be required.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的文献中没有直接相关的信息来回答关于金属氧化物催化剂失活、再生方法或在氧化脱氢过程中添加CO2的问题。提供的标题和作者信息不足以解答催化剂失活、再生技术的具体方面，或CO2对VOx催化反应的影响。要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的信息或更全面的文献来源。
