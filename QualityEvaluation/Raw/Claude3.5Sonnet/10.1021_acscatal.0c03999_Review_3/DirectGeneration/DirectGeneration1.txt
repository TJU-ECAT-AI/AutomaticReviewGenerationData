Metal oxide catalysts, particularly those based on chromium and vanadium oxides, play a crucial role in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. However, these catalysts face challenges related to deactivation, primarily due to coke formation and structural changes. To address these issues, researchers have been focusing on developing innovative regeneration strategies and performance optimization techniques. One key area of emphasis is coke mitigation, which involves modifying catalyst compositions, optimizing reaction conditions, and implementing in-situ regeneration methods. Additionally, there is growing interest in CO2 utilization as a soft oxidant in ODH processes, which not only helps in reducing carbon emissions but also potentially enhances catalyst stability. Advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy and in-situ microscopy, are being employed to gain deeper insights into deactivation mechanisms and guide the design of more robust catalysts. By combining these approaches, scientists aim to extend catalyst lifetimes, improve selectivity, and enhance the overall efficiency of ODH processes using Cr-based and VOx catalysts.
