[1] "These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."

[4] "These observed differences in carbon deposition behavior may be related to catalytic activity, since the catalysts showing higher reactivity in CO2 ODH of propane displayed greater carbon deposition."

[5] "The Raman peaks at 993 and 1033 cm1 decreased in intensity due to reduction of VOx species during the reaction, which represent the stretching mode of monomeric V=O species, while new peaks were observed at 1350 and 1598 cm1 that correspond to the D and G bands of carbon."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the ability of the catalyst surface to reoxidize becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs during CO2 ODH of propane, especially on catalysts with near-monolayer coverage. This carbon deposition is associated with higher catalytic activity.

3. Reduction of VOx species: During the reaction, VOx species are reduced, as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of Raman peaks associated with V=O stretching modes.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as shown by TGA analysis of used catalysts.

2. O2 ODH results in very little carbon deposition compared to CO2 ODH, suggesting that O2 may be more effective at preventing carbon buildup during the reaction.

3. CO2 as an oxidant leads to more carbon deposition than O2, but it may help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions due to its milder oxidizing nature.

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods likely depends on the extent of carbon deposition and the degree of VOx reduction. Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the TGA analysis suggests that air treatment at elevated temperatures can remove carbon deposits. The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration is not directly addressed in the provided information.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是VOx催化剂）的主要失活原因包括：

1. 表面再氧化受限：随着VOx覆盖率的增加，催化剂表面再氧化的能力变得更加有限，导致ODH活性降低。

2. 碳沉积：在CO2 ODH反应中，特别是在接近单层覆盖的催化剂上，会发生明显的碳沉积。这种碳沉积与较高的催化活性有关。

3. VOx物种的还原：在反应过程中，VOx物种被还原，这可以从与V=O伸缩模式相关的拉曼峰强度降低得到证实。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气再氧化似乎能有效去除碳沉积物，这从使用过的催化剂的TGA分析中可以看出。

2. 与CO2 ODH相比，O2 ODH导致的碳沉积很少，这表明O2可能更有效地防止反应过程中的碳堆积。

3. CO2作为氧化剂会导致比O2更多的碳沉积，但由于其较温和的氧化性质，可能有助于减少VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。

这些再生方法的有效性可能取决于碳沉积的程度和VOx还原的程度。文中没有明确提到再生所需的温度，但TGA分析表明，在高温下进行空气处理可以去除碳沉积物。文中没有直接提到再生后对催化性能的影响。
