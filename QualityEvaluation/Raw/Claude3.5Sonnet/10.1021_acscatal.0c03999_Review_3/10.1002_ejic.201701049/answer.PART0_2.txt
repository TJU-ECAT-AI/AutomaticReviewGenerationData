[1] "These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "Recently, Ascoop et al17 also reported significant carbon deposition even after a short time on stream during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the ability of the catalyst surface to reoxidize becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs on the catalyst surface, especially during CO2 ODH of propane. This is evident from weight losses observed in TGA of used catalysts.

3. Formation of inactive species: In Na-promoted catalysts, the presence of Na+ adversely affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, preventing the regeneration of the catalytically active V5+ oxidation state.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as evidenced by the weight loss observed during TGA in air for used catalysts.

2. O2 ODH seems to result in less carbon deposition compared to CO2 ODH, as used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss during TGA.

3. CO2 addition may help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, as the propylene yield was similar for both CO2 and O2 ODH reactions, despite lower propane conversion in CO2 ODH.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or detailed comparisons of different regeneration methods' effectiveness and impact on catalytic performance.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括：

1. 表面再氧化受限：随着VOx覆盖率的增加，催化剂表面再氧化的能力变得更加有限，导致ODH活性降低。

2. 碳沉积：催化剂表面发生显著的碳沉积，尤其是在丙烷的CO2 ODH过程中。这从使用过的催化剂在TGA中观察到的重量损失可以得到证实。

3. 形成无活性物种：在Na促进的催化剂中，Na+的存在对表面VOx物种的氧化还原行为产生不利影响，阻止了催化活性V5+氧化态的再生。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气再氧化似乎能有效去除碳沉积物，这从使用过的催化剂在空气中进行TGA时观察到的重量损失可以看出。

2. 与CO2 ODH相比，O2 ODH似乎导致较少的碳沉积，因为O2 ODH后的使用过的催化剂在TGA过程中几乎没有重量损失。

3. CO2的添加可能有助于减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，因为尽管CO2 ODH中丙烷转化率较低，但CO2和O2 ODH反应的丙烯产率相似。

然而，文献并未提供关于再生温度要求的具体信息，也没有详细比较不同再生方法的有效性及其对催化性能的影响。
