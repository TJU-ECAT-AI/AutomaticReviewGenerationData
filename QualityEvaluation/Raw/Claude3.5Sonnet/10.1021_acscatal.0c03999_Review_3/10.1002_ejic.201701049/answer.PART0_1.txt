[1] "These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "Recently, Ascoop et al17 also reported significant carbon deposition even after a short time on stream during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the extent of surface reoxidation becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even after short periods on stream. This is evidenced by weight losses during TGA in air for used catalysts.

3. Presence of promoters: The addition of Na+ adversely affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, preventing the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state necessary for propane activation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

- Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as evidenced by the TGA results showing weight loss in air for used catalysts.

- O2 ODH showed very little weight loss during TGA, suggesting that it may help prevent or minimize carbon deposition during the reaction.

- The effectiveness of CO2 in regeneration is not directly addressed, but its use as an oxidant in ODH reactions leads to significant carbon deposition, indicating it may not be as effective for catalyst regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or quantitative comparisons of the effectiveness of different regeneration methods. Additionally, while CO2 is used as an oxidant in ODH reactions, its potential for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not explicitly discussed in the given text.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是VOx催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 表面再氧化受限：随着VOx覆盖率的增加，表面再氧化的程度变得更加有限，导致ODH活性降低。

2. 碳沉积：在VOx/SiO2催化剂上进行CO2 ODH反应时，即使在短时间内也会发生明显的碳沉积。这可以通过使用后催化剂在空气中进行TGA时的重量损失得到证实。

3. 助剂的存在：Na+的添加对表面VOx物种的氧化还原行为产生不利影响，阻止了对丙烷活化重要的V5+氧化态的再生。

关于再生方法：

- 用空气再氧化似乎能有效去除碳沉积物，这从使用后催化剂在空气中进行TGA时的重量损失可以看出。

- O2 ODH在TGA过程中几乎没有重量损失，表明它可能有助于在反应过程中防止或最小化碳沉积。

- 文献中没有直接讨论CO2在再生中的有效性，但将其用作ODH反应的氧化剂会导致显著的碳沉积，这表明它可能不太适合用于催化剂再生。

文献没有提供关于再生温度要求的具体信息，也没有对不同再生方法的有效性进行定量比较。此外，虽然CO2被用作ODH反应的氧化剂，但文中并未明确讨论它在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。
