[1] "The catalytic activity rapidly decreased over the S3 catalyst (4.1 V/nm2) with time on stream. These results indicated that the VOx/SiO2 catalysts are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage."

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "Considerable carbon deposition was observed in used catalysts after propane ODH by CO2, the extent of which correlated with their catalytic activity."

[4] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Rapid deactivation with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage.

2. Carbon deposition, especially in CO2-based ODH reactions. The extent of carbon deposition correlated with catalytic activity.

3. Formation of inactive species, such as surface Na metavanadate or reduced V3+/V4+ phases when promoted with Na cations.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature mainly discusses the use of air for regeneration through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Catalysts used in O2 ODH showed very little weight loss during TGA in air, suggesting that oxidation with air could effectively remove carbon deposits. However, the document does not provide detailed comparisons of different regeneration methods or their impact on catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study does compare CO2 and O2 as oxidants, noting that while propane conversion was generally higher with O2, propylene yields were similar for both oxidants due to greater cracking reactions during O2 ODH.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是VOx催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 当VOx含量超过理论单层覆盖率时，催化剂会迅速失活。

2. 碳沉积，尤其是在基于CO2的ODH反应中。碳沉积的程度与催化活性相关。

3. 当用Na阳离子促进时，形成无活性物种，如表面Na偏钒酸盐或还原态的V3+/V4+相。

关于再生方法，文献主要讨论了通过热重分析（TGA）使用空气进行再生。在O2 ODH中使用的催化剂在空气中进行TGA时显示很少的重量损失，这表明用空气氧化可以有效去除碳沉积。然而，该文献并未详细比较不同再生方法或它们对催化性能的影响。

文献中没有直接讨论CO2添加在缓解VOx催化反应过度氧化方面的潜力。然而，研究确实比较了CO2和O2作为氧化剂的效果，指出虽然使用O2时丙烷转化率通常更高，但由于O2 ODH过程中发生更多的裂解反应，两种氧化剂得到的丙烯产率相似。

[1] "These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "Recently, Ascoop et al17 also reported significant carbon deposition even after a short time on stream during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the extent of surface reoxidation becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts, even after short periods on stream. This is evidenced by weight losses during TGA in air for used catalysts.

3. Presence of promoters: The addition of Na+ adversely affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, preventing the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state necessary for propane activation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

- Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as evidenced by the TGA results showing weight loss in air for used catalysts.

- O2 ODH showed very little weight loss during TGA, suggesting that it may help prevent or minimize carbon deposition during the reaction.

- The effectiveness of CO2 in regeneration is not directly addressed, but its use as an oxidant in ODH reactions leads to significant carbon deposition, indicating it may not be as effective for catalyst regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or quantitative comparisons of the effectiveness of different regeneration methods. Additionally, while CO2 is used as an oxidant in ODH reactions, its potential for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not explicitly discussed in the given text.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是VOx催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 表面再氧化受限：随着VOx覆盖率的增加，表面再氧化的程度变得更加有限，导致ODH活性降低。

2. 碳沉积：在VOx/SiO2催化剂上进行CO2 ODH反应时，即使在短时间内也会发生明显的碳沉积。这可以通过使用后催化剂在空气中进行TGA时的重量损失得到证实。

3. 助剂的存在：Na+的添加对表面VOx物种的氧化还原行为产生不利影响，阻止了对丙烷活化重要的V5+氧化态的再生。

关于再生方法：

- 用空气再氧化似乎能有效去除碳沉积物，这从使用后催化剂在空气中进行TGA时的重量损失可以看出。

- O2 ODH在TGA过程中几乎没有重量损失，表明它可能有助于在反应过程中防止或最小化碳沉积。

- 文献中没有直接讨论CO2在再生中的有效性，但将其用作ODH反应的氧化剂会导致显著的碳沉积，这表明它可能不太适合用于催化剂再生。

文献没有提供关于再生温度要求的具体信息，也没有对不同再生方法的有效性进行定量比较。此外，虽然CO2被用作ODH反应的氧化剂，但文中并未明确讨论它在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."

[4] "These observed differences in carbon deposition behavior may be related to catalytic activity, since the catalysts showing higher reactivity in CO2 ODH of propane displayed greater carbon deposition."

[5] "The Raman peaks at 993 and 1033 cm1 decreased in intensity due to reduction of VOx species during the reaction, which represent the stretching mode of monomeric V=O species, while new peaks were observed at 1350 and 1598 cm1 that correspond to the D and G bands of carbon."

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the ability of the catalyst surface to reoxidize becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs during CO2 ODH of propane, especially on catalysts with near-monolayer coverage. This carbon deposition is associated with higher catalytic activity.

3. Reduction of VOx species: During the reaction, VOx species are reduced, as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of Raman peaks associated with V=O stretching modes.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as shown by TGA analysis of used catalysts.

2. O2 ODH results in very little carbon deposition compared to CO2 ODH, suggesting that O2 may be more effective at preventing carbon buildup during the reaction.

3. CO2 as an oxidant leads to more carbon deposition than O2, but it may help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions due to its milder oxidizing nature.

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods likely depends on the extent of carbon deposition and the degree of VOx reduction. Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the TGA analysis suggests that air treatment at elevated temperatures can remove carbon deposits. The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration is not directly addressed in the provided information.

1. 表面再氧化受限：随着VOx覆盖率的增加，催化剂表面再氧化的能力变得更加有限，导致ODH活性降低。

2. 碳沉积：在CO2 ODH反应中，特别是在接近单层覆盖的催化剂上，会发生明显的碳沉积。这种碳沉积与较高的催化活性有关。

3. VOx物种的还原：在反应过程中，VOx物种被还原，这可以从与V=O伸缩模式相关的拉曼峰强度降低得到证实。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气再氧化似乎能有效去除碳沉积物，这从使用过的催化剂的TGA分析中可以看出。

2. 与CO2 ODH相比，O2 ODH导致的碳沉积很少，这表明O2可能更有效地防止反应过程中的碳堆积。

3. CO2作为氧化剂会导致比O2更多的碳沉积，但由于其较温和的氧化性质，可能有助于减少VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。

这些再生方法的有效性可能取决于碳沉积的程度和VOx还原的程度。文中没有明确提到再生所需的温度，但TGA分析表明，在高温下进行空气处理可以去除碳沉积物。文中没有直接提到再生后对催化性能的影响。
