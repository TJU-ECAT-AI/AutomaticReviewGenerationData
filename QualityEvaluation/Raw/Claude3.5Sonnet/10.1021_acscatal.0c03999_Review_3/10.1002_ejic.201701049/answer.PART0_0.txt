[1] "The catalytic activity rapidly decreased over the S3 catalyst (4.1 V/nm2) with time on stream. These results indicated that the VOx/SiO2 catalysts are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage."

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "Considerable carbon deposition was observed in used catalysts after propane ODH by CO2, the extent of which correlated with their catalytic activity."

[4] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Rapid deactivation with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage.

2. Carbon deposition, especially in CO2-based ODH reactions. The extent of carbon deposition correlated with catalytic activity.

3. Formation of inactive species, such as surface Na metavanadate or reduced V3+/V4+ phases when promoted with Na cations.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature mainly discusses the use of air for regeneration through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Catalysts used in O2 ODH showed very little weight loss during TGA in air, suggesting that oxidation with air could effectively remove carbon deposits. However, the document does not provide detailed comparisons of different regeneration methods or their impact on catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study does compare CO2 and O2 as oxidants, noting that while propane conversion was generally higher with O2, propylene yields were similar for both oxidants due to greater cracking reactions during O2 ODH.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是VOx催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 当VOx含量超过理论单层覆盖率时，催化剂会迅速失活。

2. 碳沉积，尤其是在基于CO2的ODH反应中。碳沉积的程度与催化活性相关。

3. 当用Na阳离子促进时，形成无活性物种，如表面Na偏钒酸盐或还原态的V3+/V4+相。

关于再生方法，文献主要讨论了通过热重分析（TGA）使用空气进行再生。在O2 ODH中使用的催化剂在空气中进行TGA时显示很少的重量损失，这表明用空气氧化可以有效去除碳沉积。然而，该文献并未详细比较不同再生方法或它们对催化性能的影响。

文献中没有直接讨论CO2添加在缓解VOx催化反应过度氧化方面的潜力。然而，研究确实比较了CO2和O2作为氧化剂的效果，指出虽然使用O2时丙烷转化率通常更高，但由于O2 ODH过程中发生更多的裂解反应，两种氧化剂得到的丙烯产率相似。
