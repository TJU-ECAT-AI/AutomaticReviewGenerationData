          "These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

"All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

"Recently, Ascoop et al17 also reported significant carbon deposition even after a short time on stream during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

"The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation."

"The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."

"These observed differences in carbon deposition behavior may be related to catalytic activity, since the catalysts showing higher reactivity in CO2 ODH of propane displayed greater carbon deposition."

"The Raman peaks at 993 and 1033 cm1 decreased in intensity due to reduction of VOx species during the reaction, which represent the stretching mode of monomeric V=O species, while new peaks were observed at 1350 and 1598 cm1 that correspond to the D and G bands of carbon."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: As VOx coverage increases, the ability of the catalyst surface to reoxidize becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs, especially during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The extent of carbon deposition varies with vanadium content, with catalysts having near-monolayer coverage showing higher weight losses during TGA. This carbon deposition is associated with higher catalytic activity.

3. Reduction of VOx species: During the reaction, VOx species are reduced, as evidenced by the decrease in intensity of Raman peaks associated with V=O stretching modes.

4. Presence of promoters: The addition of Na+ adversely affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, preventing the regeneration of the catalytically active V5+ oxidation state necessary for propane activation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air appears to be effective in removing carbon deposits, as evidenced by the weight loss observed during TGA in air for used catalysts.

2. O2 ODH results in very little carbon deposition compared to CO2 ODH, suggesting that O2 may be more effective at preventing carbon buildup during the reaction.

3. CO2 as an oxidant leads to more carbon deposition than O2, but it may help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions due to its milder oxidizing nature.

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods likely depends on the extent of carbon deposition and the degree of VOx reduction. Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the TGA analysis suggests that air treatment at elevated temperatures can remove carbon deposits. The impact on catalytic performance after regeneration is not directly addressed in the provided information.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是VOx催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 表面再氧化受限：随着VOx覆盖率的增加，催化剂表面再氧化的能力变得更加有限，导致ODH活性降低。

2. 碳沉积：显著的碳沉积发生，尤其是在VOx/SiO2催化剂上进行CO2 ODH丙烷反应时。碳沉积的程度随钒含量而变化，接近单层覆盖的催化剂在TGA过程中显示更高的重量损失。这种碳沉积与较高的催化活性相关。

3. VOx物种的还原：在反应过程中，VOx物种被还原，这可以从与V=O伸缩模式相关的拉曼峰强度降低得到证实。

4. 助剂的存在：Na+的添加对表面VOx物种的氧化还原行为产生不利影响，阻止了对丙烷活化必要的V5+氧化态的再生。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气再氧化似乎能有效去除碳沉积物，这从使用过的催化剂在空气中进行TGA时观察到的重量损失可以看出。

2. 与CO2 ODH相比，O2 ODH导致的碳沉积很少，这表明O2可能更有效地防止反应过程中的碳堆积。

3. CO2作为氧化剂会导致比O2更多的碳沉积，但由于其较温和的氧化性质，可能有助于减少VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。

这些再生方法的有效性可能取决于碳沉积的程度和VOx还原的程度。文中没有明确提到再生所需的温度，但TGA分析表明，在高温下进行空气处理可以去除碳沉积物。文中没有直接提到再生后对催化性能的影响。
