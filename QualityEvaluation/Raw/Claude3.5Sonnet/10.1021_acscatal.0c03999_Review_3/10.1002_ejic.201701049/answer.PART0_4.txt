[1] "These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts."

[2] "All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA."

[3] "The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."

[4] "The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Limited surface reoxidation: With increased VOx coverage, the extent of surface reoxidation becomes more limited, leading to decreased ODH activity.

2. Carbon deposition: Significant carbon deposition occurs during CO2 ODH of propane, particularly on catalysts with near-monolayer coverage. This carbon deposition is associated with weight loss during TGA analysis.

3. Redox behavior alteration: The presence of promoters like Na+ can adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, preventing the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state necessary for propane activation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air: TGA analysis in air showed weight loss associated with carbon removal, suggesting that air can be effective for regenerating catalysts by burning off carbon deposits.

2. CO2 vs O2: Catalysts used in O2 ODH showed very little weight loss during TGA, indicating less carbon deposition compared to CO2 ODH. This suggests that O2 may be more effective at preventing carbon formation during the reaction.

3. Temperature requirements: The study conducted ODH reactions at temperatures ranging from 550-600°C, indicating that these temperatures may be suitable for catalyst regeneration as well.

4. Impact on catalytic performance: The literature does not provide direct information on the impact of regeneration methods on catalytic performance.

5. CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation: While the study mentions using CO2 as an oxidant, it does not specifically address its potential for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

It's important to note that the literature provided focuses primarily on VOx catalysts and does not provide specific information on Cr-based catalysts or detailed comparisons of various regeneration methods. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address all aspects of the question.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 表面再氧化受限：随着VOx覆盖率的增加，表面再氧化的程度变得更加有限，导致ODH活性降低。

2. 碳沉积：在CO2 ODH丙烷过程中会发生显著的碳沉积，尤其是在接近单层覆盖的催化剂上。这种碳沉积与TGA分析中的重量损失有关。

3. 氧化还原行为改变：像Na+这样的助剂的存在可能会对表面VOx物种的氧化还原行为产生不利影响，阻止了丙烷活化所需的V5+氧化态的再生。

关于再生方法：

1. 空气再氧化：在空气中进行的TGA分析显示了与碳移除相关的重量损失，表明空气可以通过燃烧碳沉积物来有效地再生催化剂。

2. CO2与O2比较：在O2 ODH中使用的催化剂在TGA过程中显示出很少的重量损失，表明与CO2 ODH相比，碳沉积较少。这表明O2可能更有效地防止反应过程中的碳形成。

3. 温度要求：该研究在550-600°C的温度范围内进行ODH反应，表明这些温度也可能适用于催化剂再生。

4. 对催化性能的影响：文献没有提供再生方法对催化性能影响的直接信息。

5. CO2添加以减少过度氧化：虽然研究提到使用CO2作为氧化剂，但并未具体讨论其在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。

需要注意的是，所提供的文献主要关注VOx催化剂，没有提供关于Cr基催化剂的具体信息，也没有详细比较各种再生方法。要全面回答所有问题，需要进行更多的综合研究。
