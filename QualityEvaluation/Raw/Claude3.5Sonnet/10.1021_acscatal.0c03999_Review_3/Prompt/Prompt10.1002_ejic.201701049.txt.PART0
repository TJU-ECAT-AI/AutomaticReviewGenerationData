Carbon Dioxide as Feedstock in Selective Oxidation of Propane
Graphical Abstract
Silica-supported vanadia catalysts were synthesized, and the surface coverage of VOx species varied by using Na+ cations. Promotion with Na+ significantly improved the dispersion of VOx species but resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate, which lacked catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.
Abstract
Carbon dioxide is a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic dehydrogenation of lower alkanes to olefins. The lower catalytic activity of CO2 compared to oxygen, which is typically used in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), also means that more reactive olefins are less likely to undergo undesirable combustion in the presence of CO2. Supported vanadia catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of silica supports, and by varying the surface coverage of VOx species by means of sodium on the silica surface, the nature of the catalyst was investigated. Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species but resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which lacked catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2.
Introduction
Carbon dioxide (CO2) and C2C3 alkanes are well-known greenhouse gases that are generated by human activities. Our planet is projected to undergo significant environmental changes this century with potentially devastating consequences for the global economy and the natural world if humanity fails to reduce CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels. Electricity and heat generation combined with the use of hydrocarbon-based fuels in transportation have been the largest contributors of CO2, creating almost two-thirds of global emissions (e.g., 5271 million tonnes of the total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions in 2015)1 On the other hand, natural gas production continues to increase, as shale gas is rapidly becoming an alternative source of natural gas, and its production is currently one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. oil and gas industry.2 While C2C3 alkanes are the major components of shale gas, they currently have no significant applications as chemical feedstocks due to their high chemical stability and the lack of technologies that can transform them selectively into chemical intermediates. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop chemical processes that can jointly employ CO2 and C2C3 alkanes in chemical synthesis.1, 3 The total annual amount of CO2 used in industry as a chemical feedstock to make urea, inorganic carbonates, pigments, methanol, and salicylic acid is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than its annual atmospheric emissions.4 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop new large-scale chemical processes that utilize CO2 to more fully explore the potential of its fixation into value-added products.
Selective oxidation of lower alkanes has been a long-standing fundamental and practical challenge, primarily due to the inertness of CH bonds (e.g., the secondary CH bond energy of 96 kcalmol1 in propane) requiring energy-intensive conditions to achieve practical conversion and limited process selectivity due to greater reactivity of the partial oxidation products (e.g., propylene).5, 6 Recent reports indicated that CO2 is a mild oxidant that can perform oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes (C2C4) to the corresponding olefins [Equation 1], all of which are valuable chemical intermediates.
(1)
Ethane and propane ODH by CO2 is expected to produce a 1:1 molar mixture of olefins with carbon monoxide that can be directly used in a variety of downstream chemical processes, such as copolymerization to produce valuable thermoplastic polyketones7 and hydroformylation8 to make a variety of aldehyde intermediates.
Supported vanadia and chromia catalysts have been identified in recent studies as the most promising catalysts for ODH of lower alkanes by CO2.9-15 These catalysts are typically synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of oxide supports such as SiO2, Al2O3, CeO2, and ZrO2 by solutions of VV and CrIII precursors, such as ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) and CrIII nitrate, followed by drying and thermal activation at about 350 C in air to produce well-dispersed, tetrahedrally coordinated molecular VOx and CrOx species on the surface of the oxide supports. The catalytic activity and selectivity of these supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in lower-alkane ODH is associated with the presence of monomeric and polymeric VOx and CrOx species at submonolayer surface coverage. Therefore, the catalytic behavior of these catalysts may be tuned by varying the surface coverage of VOx and CrOx species, the nature of the oxide support, and addition of promoter species.9-15
In a recent study,15 silica-supported vanadia catalysts have been extensively investigated and found to be highly promising for propane ODH with molecular oxygen. However, the silica-supported catalysts display significantly lower monolayer coverage of vanadia (ca. 3.3 V/nm2) compared to other, more reactive oxide supports, such as alumina (79 V/nm2). The promotion of silica with Na+ cations resulted in significantly enhanced dispersion of monomeric vanadia species on SiO2.16 This effect was found to be optimal at a Na+/V ratio of 0.2, and above this ratio the formation of sodium metavanadate resulted in the loss of catalytic activity. According to Grant et al.,16 the Na+ reacts with surface silanol groups to form more reactive SiONa+ anchoring sites that bond to several monomeric vanadia species. Therefore, the use of the Na+ species to promote VOx dispersion on the silica surface offers new opportunities to design novel 2D metal oxide catalysts supported on SiO2. According to Grant et al.,16 greater surface coverage of 2D vanadia species in Na-promoted catalysts leads to a higher rate of propane ODH while maintaining high propylene selectivity. However, the behavior of Na-promoted vanadia catalysts in propane ODH by CO2 has not been investigated. Therefore, in this study we synthesized Na-promoted vanadia catalysts supported on silica and investigated their behavior in propane ODH reactions employing molecular oxygen and CO2.
Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the composition of model supported vanadia catalysts synthesized in this study. A series of VOx/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized at different vanadia loadings to study the effect of vanadia surface coverage on conversion and selectivity in propane ODH. The vanadia surface coverage16 in these catalysts ranged from 54 to 185% of a theoretical monolayer on the silica support in the absence of Na+, and from 21 to 72% for the Na-promoted silica.

a The vanadium content (wt.%) was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
The occurrence of homogeneous reactions was investigated first by passing the above-mentioned propane/O2 and propane/CO2 mixtures through an empty reactor and over the original silica support at 550750 C. For an empty reactor, trace amounts of ethylene and methane were detected above 650 C for the propane/O2 mixture, while no reaction was observed for the propane/CO2 mixture at any temperature. Similar results were observed for the ODH reactions over the original silica support, that is, trace levels of ethylene and methane above 550 C for the propane/O2 mixture. Moreover, no reaction products were observed up to 700 C for the propane/CO2 mixture, while above 700 C, CO and a trace amount of propane cracking products were observed. However, we observed the occurrence of homogeneous combustion reaction over silica support in the presence of O2 above 600 C, as well as cracking reaction products when the reactor temperature was further increased to 700 C. However, no reactions were observed over the silica support at relevant temperatures (600 C and below) employed in this study to investigate propane ODH reactions. Moreover, while propane ODH in the presence of O2 and CO2 was investigated over silica-supported vanadia catalysts at 350600 C, significant propane conversion was observed only at 550 and 600 C.
Table 2 shows the initial propane conversion and product selectivity of propane ODH over VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 550 C. In the case of O2, the formation of C1 and C2 products increased with increasing vanadia content in these catalysts. Also, as expected, the conversion of propane was considerably higher during O2 ODH compared to CO2 ODH. However, the propylene yield was similar for both CO2 and O2 ODH reactions due to a greater extent of cracking reactions during O2 ODH. The propane conversion over S1 catalyst (1.9 V/nm2) was 18 mol-% for O2 ODH and 9.2 mol-% for CO2 ODH, while it increased with vanadia content, for example, to 25 mol-% for the S2 catalyst for both O2 and CO2 ODH reactions, and reached a maximum for the S3 catalyst. The maximum yield of propylene of about 11 mol-% was observed over S2 catalyst (3.1 V/nm2). Note that the S1 catalyst corresponded to about 50% of theoretical monolayer coverage of vanadia on silica, whereas the S2 and S3 catalysts are characterized by about 90 and 120% monolayer coverage, respectively. Therefore, on the basis of the initial reactivity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in these two ODH reactions, one may conclude that the presence of a monolayer of surface VOx species is important for the reactivity in these propane ODH reactions.

Table 3 shows the initial propane conversions and product selectivities for propane ODH over VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 600 C. The propane conversion and formation of C1C3 cracking products increased dramatically at 600 C, while the propylene yield was not significantly affected. The main difference in reaction products observed for CO2 and O2 ODH reactions was the significant amount of CO produced in the former case and methane in the latter. The C2 products ethane and ethylene were not observed among the reaction products during CO2 ODH, except over the S4 catalyst (6.6 V/nm2) at 600 C, which contained about 180% theoretical monolayers of VOx species. However, ethylene and CO2 were already observed at low temperature (450 C) during O2 ODH. The conversion of propane increased with increasing VOx coverage, reaching a maximum over the S3 catalyst and then declining at higher VOx coverage.

Turnover frequencies (TOF) for propane consumption were calculated by Equation 2:
(2)
The TOFs report the numbers of propane molecules converted at each VOx species per second, where  denotes the molar flow rate of propane [mol/s], X the fractional conversion, MV the molar mass of vanadium [g/mol], mcat the catalyst weight [g], and WV the vanadium content [wt.%]. Figure 1 shows the TOFs for propane consumption as a function of surface VOx coverage at 500 C at different space velocities to maintain low propane conversion (<15%). All supported vanadia catalysts showed very similar TOFs, except for the S1 catalyst (lowest V content). The S2 and S3 catalysts (3.1 and 4.1 V/nm2, respectively, close to theoretical monolayer coverage) showed the maximum TOF, but the values only varied from 3.8×103 s1 to 4.1×103 s1 among the three vanadia catalysts S2, S3, and S4.

All supported vanadia catalysts were further investigated at 550 and 600 C, GHSV = 2500 h1, and feed composition of CO2/C3H8 = 2:1 (Figures S1S4) as a function of time on stream. The S1 catalyst (1.9 V/nm2) initially displayed low catalytic activity at 550 C, which was subsequently lost after 2 h under catalytic reaction conditions, while stable catalytic behavior was observed at 600 C for more than 3.5 h. The S2 catalyst (3.1 V/nm2) initially showed high catalytic activity, which continuously declined with time at 550 C. The formation of C1 and C2 products dramatically increased at 600 C after 3 h on stream, while propane conversion and propylene selectivity decreased. On the other hand, the catalytic activity rapidly decreased over the S3 catalyst (4.1 V/nm2) with time on stream. These results indicated that the VOx/SiO2 catalysts are rapidly deactivated with increasing VOx content above the theoretical monolayer coverage. The catalytic activity did not increase with reaction temperature, while the selectivity to propylene decreased at the expense of propane cracking reactions. Moreover, the S2 and S3 catalysts that showed higher conversion for CO2 ODH of propane tended to be deactivated rather quickly with time on stream. Also, deactivation of the S2 and S3 catalysts was accelerated at a higher reaction temperature of 600 C, as propane conversion decreased by about 50% after 1 h under catalytic reaction conditions. These results suggested that a more limited extent of surface reoxidation with increased VOx coverage may be responsible for the decreased ODH activity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts.
Figure 2 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves for used VOx/SiO2 catalysts after CO2 ODH of propane at 600 C for 72 h. All used catalysts exhibited a weight losses during TGA in air associated with carbon deposition, whereas used catalysts after O2 ODH showed very little weight loss features in TGA. Recently, Ascoop et al17 also reported significant carbon deposition even after a short time on stream during CO2 ODH of propane over VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA. These observed differences in carbon deposition behavior may be related to catalytic activity, since the catalysts showing higher reactivity in CO2 ODH of propane displayed greater carbon deposition. These results suggested that the acidic silica support may also play a role in initiating carbon deposition by adsorbing hydrocarbon intermediates during the ODH reaction in the presence of CO2. However, the exposure of the silica surface to hydrocarbon intermediates is minimized above monolayer coverage of the VOx species, for example, for S4 (6.6 V/nm2), and this explains the diminished carbon deposition observed for this catalyst (ca. 2% weight loss).

Na-promoted silica supports were employed to improve surface dispersion of 2D VOx species. Table 4 shows the results of CO2 ODH of propane over Na-promoted VOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared at the same VOx surface coverage as the Na-free supported VOx catalysts (Table 1). Unlike Na-free catalysts, Na-promoted VOx/SiO2 catalysts showed no selectivity to propylene and instead displayed increasing tendency to form cracking products, ethane and methane, with increasing vanadium content. The Na-promoted catalysts showed very low catalytic activity at 550 and 600 C. At a high reaction temperature of 600 C, a selectivity of greater than 85% to ethylene was observed over all the catalysts, while at a reaction temperature of 550 C only CO was observed with very low propane conversion of less than 2%. The selectivity to C2 species (ethane and ethylene) was particularly high and remained relatively constant over all catalysts investigated, and this suggests that these species may represent reaction intermediates during propane/propylene degradation to methane.

Raman spectra of the Na-free and Na-promoted silica support and VOx/SiO2 catalysts were recorded to establish the nature of the surface species in these two series of supported vanadia catalysts. Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of the Na-free and Na-promoted silica supports. Raman peaks at 1058 and 1023 cm1 in the spectrum of the Na-bearing silica support (upper spectrum in Figure 3) are assigned to sodium silicate.16 Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra of Na-free and Na-promoted S2 catalysts as well as corresponding silica supports. The Raman spectrum of the Na-free S2 catalyst (upper spectrum in Figure 4a) shows peaks at 993 and 1033 cm1, which correspond to the bulk V2O5 crystals and V=O stretching vibration of the monomeric VOx species, respectively.17 The addition of Na resulted in the appearance of Raman peaks at 506, 637, 914, and 950 cm1 associated with the presence of Na metavanadate instead of 2D or 3D vanadia.18 Sodium metavanadate was previously reported to be inactive in ODH reactions,16-19 which may explain the lack of catalytic activity of our Na-promoted VOx/SiO2 catalysts. According to lrusta et al.,19 vanadate species react with Na+ cations present on the surface of the Na-promoted silica to form surface NaVO3-like compounds that are inactive for methane oxidation to formaldehyde. Similar observations were made by Adamski et al.,20 who reported that the conversion of propane during its ODH over alkali metal doped supported 3V/Zr catalysts decreased in the following order: undoped > Li+ > Na+ > K+, indicating that alkali metal dopants were detrimental to the ODH activity of supported vanadia catalysts. Furthermore, we confirmed carbon deposition in used catalysts by comparing the Raman spectra of fresh and used catalysts. Figure 5 compares the Raman spectra of fresh and used S4 catalysts after propane ODH in the presence of CO2 (GHSV = 2500 h1 and CO2/C3H8 = 2:1 in He balance at 600 C). The Raman peaks at 993 and 1033 cm1 decreased in intensity due to reduction of VOx species during the reaction, which represent the stretching mode of monomeric V=O species, while new peaks were observed at 1350 and 1598 cm1 that correspond to the D and G bands of carbon. The G band represents graphitic carbon and the D band represents disorder of the sp2-bonded carbon.21

Figure 6 shows the Raman spectra of the Na-free and Na-promoted S4 catalysts containing the highest VOx loading (6.6 V/nm2). The V=O stretching band that is clearly observed at 1028 cm1 in the absence of Na+ indicates the presence of molecularly dispersed VOx species. However, broadening of this band with increasing vanadium content might be due to a higher content of microcrystalline V2O5 compared to the catalysts with lower VOx coverage. The Raman features of molecularly dispersed VOx species were absent in the Raman spectrum of the Na-promoted S4 catalyst. Surface Na metavanadate was also expected for this catalyst, although its Raman spectrum lacked strong features associated with Na metavanadate, in agreement with previous observations.16 Improved vanadium dispersion in the presence of Na+ was further confirmed by EDS elemental mapping. Figure S5 shows the results of elemental mapping for V, Si, O, C, and Na on Na-free and Na-promoted S4 catalysts (6.6 V/nm2) corresponding to the highest V loading investigated in this study. In the absence of Na+, a large vanadium oxide particle is visible in the center top region of the images shown in Figure S5a, which confirms that VOx species form a bulk phase above theoretical monolayer coverage (185.7% in Table 1). In the presence of Na+, the dispersion of VOx species is improved significantly, as manifested in the absence of large vanadium oxide particles (Figure S5b). Increased theoretical monolayer coverage of VOx in Na-promoted catalysts reduces the V surface coverage in the Na-promoted S4 catalyst to about 72.2% of the theoretical monolayer (Table 1). However, while Na promotion improves the dispersion of VOx species on silica, it results in the formation of surface Na metavanadate species that lack catalytic activity in both propane ODH reactions. The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation.

Conclusions
Propane ODH by O2 and CO2 was performed over Na-free and Na-promoted supported VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The propylene yield was very similar in both CO2 and O2 ODH reactions with a maximum value of about 11 mol-% observed for the S2 catalyst. However, the propane conversion increased dramatically with increasing vanadium content, for example, 18% for O2 and 9.2% for CO2 ODH at 1.9 V/nm2 for the S1 catalyst, while it increased to greater than 25% at higher VOx loadings for both O2 and CO2 ODH. We observed a trend through Raman spectroscopic studies that with increasing vanadium content on silica, 2D vanadia structures are formed at first, and then formation of 3D vanadia crystalline structure is favorable. Thus, the maximum amount of 2D vanadia structure that shows high activity for CO2 ODH of propane was obtained in a monolayer-coverage range, and we confirmed this by calculating the TOF of propane conversion. Considerable carbon deposition was observed in used catalysts after propane ODH by CO2, the extent of which correlated with their catalytic activity. Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2.
Experimental Section
A series of VOx/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized with different vanadia loadings to study the effect of vanadia surface coverage on conversion and selectivity in propane ODH. Ammonium metavanadate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99% ACS grade) was deposited on a commercial silica support (Saint-Gobain, SS 61138, BET surface area: 261 m2g1) by incipient wetness impregnation at four different vanadia loadings. After impregnation, the as-synthesized catalysts were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 C for 4 h and then calcined in air at 550 C for 3 h. , Four different Na-promoted VOx/SiO2 catalysts were also synthesized with the same vanadia loadings (Table 1). First, Na-promoted silica supports were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the same silica support with a solution of NaNO3 (Fisher Scientific, Certified ACS Grade, >99% purity). Na loadings were adjusted for different supported vanadia catalysts to yield Na-promoted VOx/SiO2 catalysts with an atomic ratio of Na/V = 00.3. Prior to VOx deposition, as-synthesized Na-promoted silica was calcined in air by ramping the temperature at 1.5 C min1 to 700 C and holding for 4 h. These catalysts were then synthesized by the same procedures as described above for the Na-free catalysts. The surface loadings (V/nm2) and coverages (% of the theoretical monolayer) reported in Table 1 were calculated on the basis of EDS V and Si compositions in these catalysts. The V content (wt.%) was converted to surface loadings (V/nm2) according to Equation 3:
(3)
These loadings were referenced to theoretical monolayer coverages reported by Grant et al.16 to yield the vanadium surface coverages reported in Table 1.
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by O2 and CO2 was performed at atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed tubular reactor. Different VOx/SiO2 catalysts (0.5 g) placed between quartz wool plugs inside the reactor (a stainless steel tube of 1/4 inch O.D.) were pretreated in a flowing O2/He mixture (10 mL/min each) for 1 h at 450 C prior to the catalytic tests. The feed gas mixture consisted of helium (UHP grade, Wright Brothers, Inc.), carbon dioxide (Tech. grade, Wright Brothers, Inc.) or oxygen (UHP grade, Wright Brothers, Inc.), and propane (CP grade, Matheson gas) at a total flow rate of 16 mL/min to establish a GHSV of 2500 h1. The O2 concentration employed in these studies was half of the CO2 concentration used in ODH reaction to minimize homogeneous oxidation of propane (propane/oxidant ratio of 2:1 for CO2 and 1:1 for O2, balance of He), while the reaction temperature was varied from 350 to 550 C. The effluent gas was directly passed through heated sampling valves to an online GCMS system (Shimadzu, GCMS QP-5000) equipped with a capillary column (Supelco, Carboxen 1006 PLOT, fused silica) of 30 m in length and 0.32 m film thickness with ultrapure helium (Wright Brother Inc., Lot 90471) as the carrier gas. The products were identified by using NIST Mass Spectrum Library 2008 (Shimadzu, No. 225-13290-91). The catalysts were also characterized by TGA (SDT-Q600 unit from TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) and Raman spectroscopy (Horiba T64000, Horiba Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) with a 514 nm laser line, before and after the ODH of propane. STEM imaging and EDS elemental mapping of the two S4 catalysts corresponding to the highest V surface loading investigated in this study were conducted using the FEI Probe Corrected Titan3 80300 S/TEM.
