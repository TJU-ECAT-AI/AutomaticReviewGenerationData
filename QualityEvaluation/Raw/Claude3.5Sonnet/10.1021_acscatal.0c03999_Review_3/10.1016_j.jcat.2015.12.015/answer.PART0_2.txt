[1] "Carbon dioxide was not observed in all cases. Water formation passed through a maximum and then completely disappeared after 80 s (Fig. 8d). This can be explained by the fact that initially the catalyst is partially oxidized and that selective oxidative dehydrogenation is accompanied by non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

[2] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[3] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

[4] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Formation of surface carbon deposits
2. Reduction of the active metal oxide species (e.g. V2O5 to V2O3)
3. Clustering of active species leading to loss of dispersion

Regeneration methods compared:

1. Reoxidation with O2: Most effective, can fully reoxidize V2O3 to V2O5. Requires higher temperatures.

2. Reoxidation with CO2: Less effective, can only oxidize V2O3 to V2O4. Requires lower temperatures than O2. Regenerates about 45% of the oxygen compared to O2.

3. Reoxidation with air: Not specifically discussed, but likely similar to O2.

CO2 addition impacts:

1. Suppresses surface carbon formation, reducing deactivation
2. Participates in oxidative dehydrogenation, maintaining some catalyst activity
3. Mitigates overoxidation by only oxidizing to V2O4 instead of V2O5
4. Allows for lower reaction temperatures

Overall, CO2 addition shows promise for mitigating overoxidation and carbon formation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, while maintaining catalytic activity through partial reoxidation. However, it cannot fully regenerate the catalyst to its most active V2O5 state.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括：

1. 表面碳沉积物的形成
2. 活性金属氧化物物种的还原（如V2O5还原为V2O3）
3. 活性物种的聚集导致分散度降低

再生方法比较：

1. 用O2再氧化：最有效，可以将V2O3完全再氧化为V2O5。需要较高温度。

2. 用CO2再氧化：效果较差，只能将V2O3氧化为V2O4。所需温度比O2低。与O2相比，只能再生约45%的氧。

3. 用空气再氧化：未具体讨论，但可能与O2相似。

CO2添加的影响：

1. 抑制表面碳的形成，减少失活
2. 参与氧化脱氢，维持部分催化活性
3. 通过仅氧化至V2O4而非V2O5来缓解过度氧化
4. 允许较低的反应温度

总的来说，CO2的添加在VOx催化反应中显示出减轻过度氧化和碳形成的潜力，同时通过部分再氧化维持催化活性。然而，它不能将催化剂完全再生到最活跃的V2O5状态。
