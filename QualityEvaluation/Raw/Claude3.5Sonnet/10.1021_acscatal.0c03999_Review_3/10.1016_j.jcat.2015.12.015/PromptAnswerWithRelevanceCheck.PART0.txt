[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

[3] "The amount of carbon in mmolC/molVOx deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was approximately the same as for the O2 oxidized catalysts"

[4] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include carbon deposition and overoxidation. 

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with O2 is highly effective, capable of fully oxidizing V2O3 to V2O5. However, this can lead to overoxidation and formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. CO2 reoxidation is less aggressive, oxidizing V2O3 only to V2O4. This partial reoxidation helps maintain catalyst selectivity by preventing overoxidation.

3. Air reoxidation effectiveness is not explicitly discussed in the given text.

Temperature requirements for regeneration are not specifically mentioned in the provided excerpts.

CO2 addition has a significant positive impact on catalytic performance:

1. It participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. It suppresses surface carbon formation, with carbon deposition being three times less when CO2 is present in the reaction mixture.
3. It helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by only partially reoxidizing the catalyst (to V2O4 instead of V2O5), potentially maintaining better selectivity.

Overall, CO2 appears to be an effective oxidant for VOx catalysts, offering a balance between maintaining catalyst activity and preventing overoxidation and carbon deposition.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括碳沉积和过度氧化。

关于再生方法：

1. 用O2再氧化非常有效，能够将V2O3完全氧化为V2O5。然而，这可能导致过度氧化和非选择性氧物种的形成。

2. CO2再氧化较为温和，仅将V2O3氧化至V2O4。这种部分再氧化有助于通过防止过度氧化来维持催化剂的选择性。

3. 空气再氧化的效果在给定的文本中没有明确讨论。

再生所需的温度要求在提供的摘录中没有具体提及。

CO2的添加对催化性能有显著的积极影响：

1. 它参与了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。
2. 它抑制了表面碳的形成，当反应混合物中存在CO2时，碳沉积量减少了三倍。
3. 它有助于缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，因为它只将催化剂部分再氧化（到V2O4而不是V2O5），可能保持更好的选择性。

总的来说，CO2似乎是VOx催化剂的有效氧化剂，在保持催化剂活性和防止过度氧化及碳沉积之间提供了平衡。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of surface carbon and the reduction of active metal oxide species. For VOx catalysts, deactivation occurs due to the reduction of V2O5 to lower oxidation states.

Regeneration methods vary in their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with O2 or air is highly effective, capable of fully oxidizing V2O3 back to V2O5.

2. CO2 as a regeneration agent is less effective than O2. It can only oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, regenerating less than half of the exchangeable oxygen compared to O2 oxidation.

3. CO2 addition during the reaction has several benefits:
   - It participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
   - It suppresses the formation of surface carbon, reducing carbon deposits by up to three times compared to reactions without CO2.
   - It helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by maintaining a partially reduced state (V2O4) rather than fully oxidizing to V2O5.

The temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the experiments were conducted at 600°C, suggesting that regeneration with both O2 and CO2 is effective at this temperature.

The impact on catalytic performance includes:
- CO2 addition leads to a combination of oxidative dehydrogenation, non-oxidative dehydrogenation, and reverse water gas shift reactions.
- It improves selectivity towards propylene production.
- The presence of CO2 maintains the catalyst in a partially reduced state, which may be beneficial for certain reactions.

In summary, while O2 is more effective for complete catalyst regeneration, CO2 offers unique benefits in terms of reaction selectivity and carbon suppression, making it a valuable addition to VOx-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括表面碳的形成和活性金属氧化物物种的还原。对于VOx催化剂，失活是由于V2O5还原为较低氧化态而发生的。

再生方法在效果上有所不同：

1. 用O2或空气再氧化非常有效，能够将V2O3完全氧化回V2O5。

2. CO2作为再生剂的效果不如O2。它只能将V2O3氧化到V2O4，与O2氧化相比，可交换氧的再生量不到一半。

3. 在反应过程中添加CO2有几个好处：
   - 它参与了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。
   - 它抑制了表面碳的形成，与不含CO2的反应相比，碳沉积减少了多达三倍。
   - 它有助于减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，通过保持部分还原状态（V2O4）而不是完全氧化到V2O5。

文献中没有明确说明再生的温度要求。然而，实验是在600°C下进行的，这表明在这个温度下，用O2和CO2进行再生都是有效的。

对催化性能的影响包括：
- CO2的添加导致氧化脱氢、非氧化脱氢和逆水气变换反应的组合。
- 它提高了丙烯生产的选择性。
- CO2的存在使催化剂保持在部分还原状态，这可能对某些反应有利。

总之，虽然O2对完全催化剂再生更有效，但CO2在反应选择性和碳抑制方面提供了独特的优势，使其成为VOx催化氧化脱氢过程中的一个有价值的添加剂。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Formation of surface carbon deposits
2. Reduction of the active metal oxide species (e.g. V2O5 to V2O3)
3. Clustering of active species leading to loss of dispersion

Regeneration methods compared:

1. Reoxidation with O2: Most effective, can fully reoxidize V2O3 to V2O5. Requires higher temperatures.

2. Reoxidation with CO2: Less effective, can only oxidize V2O3 to V2O4. Requires lower temperatures than O2. Regenerates about 45% of the oxygen compared to O2.

3. Reoxidation with air: Not specifically discussed, but likely similar to O2.

CO2 addition impacts:

1. Suppresses surface carbon formation, reducing deactivation
2. Participates in oxidative dehydrogenation, maintaining some catalyst activity
3. Mitigates overoxidation by only oxidizing to V2O4 instead of V2O5
4. Allows for lower reaction temperatures

Overall, CO2 addition shows promise for mitigating overoxidation and carbon formation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, while maintaining catalytic activity through partial reoxidation. However, it cannot fully regenerate the catalyst to its most active V2O5 state.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of surface carbon (coke) and the reduction of the active metal species.

Various regeneration methods compare as follows:

1. Reoxidation with O2: This method is highly effective, capable of fully oxidizing V3+ back to V5+. It restores the catalyst to its original state but may lead to overoxidation.

2. Reoxidation with CO2: This method is less aggressive than O2. It can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 but not to V2O5. It provides about 45% of the oxygen capacity compared to O2 oxidation. This partial oxidation may help maintain the catalyst in an optimal state for the reaction.

3. Reoxidation with air: Not specifically mentioned in the given text, but it would likely have effects similar to O2, though possibly less intense due to dilution with nitrogen.

CO2 addition shows promise for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. It participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene while suppressing the formation of surface carbon. When CO2 is present in the reaction mixture, the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst is three times less than when only propane is present. This suggests that CO2 plays a significant role in maintaining catalyst activity by reducing coke formation.

The effectiveness of these methods likely depends on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst composition. Temperature requirements are not explicitly stated in the given text, but the experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 500°C to 600°C.

In terms of impact on catalytic performance, CO2 addition appears to offer a balance between maintaining catalyst activity and preventing overoxidation, potentially leading to improved selectivity and longer catalyst lifetime.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对基于Cr和VOx的催化剂，包括表面碳（焦炭）的形成和活性金属物种的还原。

各种再生方法的比较如下：

1. 用O2再氧化：这种方法非常有效，能够将V3+完全氧化回V5+。它可以将催化剂恢复到原始状态，但可能导致过度氧化。

2. 用CO2再氧化：这种方法比O2温和。它可以将V2O3氧化到V2O4，但不能氧化到V2O5。与O2氧化相比，它提供约45%的氧气容量。这种部分氧化可能有助于将催化剂保持在反应的最佳状态。

3. 用空气再氧化：在给定的文本中没有具体提到，但可能会有类似于O2的效果，尽管由于与氮气的稀释，强度可能较低。

CO2的添加在减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化方面显示出前景。它参与了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢，同时抑制了表面碳的形成。当CO2存在于反应混合物中时，沉积在催化剂上的碳量比只有丙烷存在时少三倍。这表明CO2通过减少焦炭形成在维持催化剂活性方面发挥了重要作用。

这些方法的有效性可能取决于具体的反应条件和催化剂组成。文本中没有明确说明温度要求，但实验是在500°C到600°C的温度范围内进行的。

在对催化性能的影响方面，CO2的添加似乎在维持催化剂活性和防止过度氧化之间提供了平衡，可能导致选择性的提高和催化剂寿命的延长。
