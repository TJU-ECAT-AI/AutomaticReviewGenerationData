[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."

[3] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."

[4] "The amount of oxygen present in the O2 oxidized catalyst was 1.9 mol/molVOx. This result is close to the theoretical amount of available oxygen for reduction of V5+ to V3+. When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2."

[5] "The amount of carbon in mmolC/molVOx deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was approximately the same as for the O2 oxidized catalysts"

[6] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of surface carbon (coke) and the reduction of the active metal species.

Various regeneration methods compare as follows:

1. Reoxidation with O2: This method is highly effective, capable of fully oxidizing V3+ back to V5+. It restores the catalyst to its original state but may lead to overoxidation.

2. Reoxidation with CO2: This method is less aggressive than O2. It can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 but not to V2O5. It provides about 45% of the oxygen capacity compared to O2 oxidation. This partial oxidation may help maintain the catalyst in an optimal state for the reaction.

3. Reoxidation with air: Not specifically mentioned in the given text, but it would likely have effects similar to O2, though possibly less intense due to dilution with nitrogen.

CO2 addition shows promise for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. It participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene while suppressing the formation of surface carbon. When CO2 is present in the reaction mixture, the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst is three times less than when only propane is present. This suggests that CO2 plays a significant role in maintaining catalyst activity by reducing coke formation.

The effectiveness of these methods likely depends on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst composition. Temperature requirements are not explicitly stated in the given text, but the experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 500°C to 600°C.

In terms of impact on catalytic performance, CO2 addition appears to offer a balance between maintaining catalyst activity and preventing overoxidation, potentially leading to improved selectivity and longer catalyst lifetime.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对基于Cr和VOx的催化剂，包括表面碳（焦炭）的形成和活性金属物种的还原。

各种再生方法的比较如下：

1. 用O2再氧化：这种方法非常有效，能够将V3+完全氧化回V5+。它可以将催化剂恢复到原始状态，但可能导致过度氧化。

2. 用CO2再氧化：这种方法比O2温和。它可以将V2O3氧化到V2O4，但不能氧化到V2O5。与O2氧化相比，它提供约45%的氧气容量。这种部分氧化可能有助于将催化剂保持在反应的最佳状态。

3. 用空气再氧化：在给定的文本中没有具体提到，但可能会有类似于O2的效果，尽管由于与氮气的稀释，强度可能较低。

CO2的添加在减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化方面显示出前景。它参与了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢，同时抑制了表面碳的形成。当CO2存在于反应混合物中时，沉积在催化剂上的碳量比只有丙烷存在时少三倍。这表明CO2通过减少焦炭形成在维持催化剂活性方面发挥了重要作用。

这些方法的有效性可能取决于具体的反应条件和催化剂组成。文本中没有明确说明温度要求，但实验是在500°C到600°C的温度范围内进行的。

在对催化性能的影响方面，CO2的添加似乎在维持催化剂活性和防止过度氧化之间提供了平衡，可能导致选择性的提高和催化剂寿命的延长。
