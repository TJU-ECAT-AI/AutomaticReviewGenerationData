[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."

[3] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."

[4] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

[5] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of surface carbon and the reduction of active metal oxide species. For VOx catalysts, deactivation occurs due to the reduction of V2O5 to lower oxidation states.

Regeneration methods vary in their effectiveness:

1. Reoxidation with O2 or air is highly effective, capable of fully oxidizing V2O3 back to V2O5.

2. CO2 as a regeneration agent is less effective than O2. It can only oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, regenerating less than half of the exchangeable oxygen compared to O2 oxidation.

3. CO2 addition during the reaction has several benefits:
   - It participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
   - It suppresses the formation of surface carbon, reducing carbon deposits by up to three times compared to reactions without CO2.
   - It helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by maintaining a partially reduced state (V2O4) rather than fully oxidizing to V2O5.

The temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the experiments were conducted at 600°C, suggesting that regeneration with both O2 and CO2 is effective at this temperature.

The impact on catalytic performance includes:
- CO2 addition leads to a combination of oxidative dehydrogenation, non-oxidative dehydrogenation, and reverse water gas shift reactions.
- It improves selectivity towards propylene production.
- The presence of CO2 maintains the catalyst in a partially reduced state, which may be beneficial for certain reactions.

In summary, while O2 is more effective for complete catalyst regeneration, CO2 offers unique benefits in terms of reaction selectivity and carbon suppression, making it a valuable addition to VOx-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括表面碳的形成和活性金属氧化物物种的还原。对于VOx催化剂，失活是由于V2O5还原为较低氧化态而发生的。

再生方法在效果上有所不同：

1. 用O2或空气再氧化非常有效，能够将V2O3完全氧化回V2O5。

2. CO2作为再生剂的效果不如O2。它只能将V2O3氧化到V2O4，与O2氧化相比，可交换氧的再生量不到一半。

3. 在反应过程中添加CO2有几个好处：
   - 它参与了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。
   - 它抑制了表面碳的形成，与不含CO2的反应相比，碳沉积减少了多达三倍。
   - 它有助于减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，通过保持部分还原状态（V2O4）而不是完全氧化到V2O5。

文献中没有明确说明再生的温度要求。然而，实验是在600°C下进行的，这表明在这个温度下，用O2和CO2进行再生都是有效的。

对催化性能的影响包括：
- CO2的添加导致氧化脱氢、非氧化脱氢和逆水气变换反应的组合。
- 它提高了丙烯生产的选择性。
- CO2的存在使催化剂保持在部分还原状态，这可能对某些反应有利。

总之，虽然O2对完全催化剂再生更有效，但CO2在反应选择性和碳抑制方面提供了独特的优势，使其成为VOx催化氧化脱氢过程中的一个有价值的添加剂。
