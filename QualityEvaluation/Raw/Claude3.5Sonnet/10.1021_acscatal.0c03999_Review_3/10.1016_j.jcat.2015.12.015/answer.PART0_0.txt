[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

[3] "The amount of carbon in mmolC/molVOx deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was approximately the same as for the O2 oxidized catalysts"

[4] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include carbon deposition and overoxidation. 

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with O2 is highly effective, capable of fully oxidizing V2O3 to V2O5. However, this can lead to overoxidation and formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. CO2 reoxidation is less aggressive, oxidizing V2O3 only to V2O4. This partial reoxidation helps maintain catalyst selectivity by preventing overoxidation.

3. Air reoxidation effectiveness is not explicitly discussed in the given text.

Temperature requirements for regeneration are not specifically mentioned in the provided excerpts.

CO2 addition has a significant positive impact on catalytic performance:

1. It participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. It suppresses surface carbon formation, with carbon deposition being three times less when CO2 is present in the reaction mixture.
3. It helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by only partially reoxidizing the catalyst (to V2O4 instead of V2O5), potentially maintaining better selectivity.

Overall, CO2 appears to be an effective oxidant for VOx catalysts, offering a balance between maintaining catalyst activity and preventing overoxidation and carbon deposition.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括碳沉积和过度氧化。

关于再生方法：

1. 用O2再氧化非常有效，能够将V2O3完全氧化为V2O5。然而，这可能导致过度氧化和非选择性氧物种的形成。

2. CO2再氧化较为温和，仅将V2O3氧化至V2O4。这种部分再氧化有助于通过防止过度氧化来维持催化剂的选择性。

3. 空气再氧化的效果在给定的文本中没有明确讨论。

再生所需的温度要求在提供的摘录中没有具体提及。

CO2的添加对催化性能有显著的积极影响：

1. 它参与了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。
2. 它抑制了表面碳的形成，当反应混合物中存在CO2时，碳沉积量减少了三倍。
3. 它有助于缓解VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，因为它只将催化剂部分再氧化（到V2O4而不是V2O5），可能保持更好的选择性。

总的来说，CO2似乎是VOx催化剂的有效氧化剂，在保持催化剂活性和防止过度氧化及碳沉积之间提供了平衡。
