[1] "The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation."

[2] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[3] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2."

[4] "This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst."

[5] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Formation of bulk V2O5, which decreases selectivity and favors total oxidation.
2. Clustering of VOx species during reaction.
3. Surface carbon formation.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with O2 is more effective in fully oxidizing the catalyst compared to CO2.
2. CO2 reoxidation oxidizes V2O3 to V2O4, while O2 can oxidize it further to V2O5.
3. CO2 addition helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by:
   a) Suppressing surface carbon formation
   b) Partially oxidizing the catalyst (to V2O4 instead of V2O5)
   c) Participating in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene

The addition of WOx to VOx catalysts improves performance by:
1. Hindering the clustering of VOx species during reaction
2. Acting as a physical barrier between VOx species

While specific temperature requirements are not mentioned, the effectiveness of CO2 as a milder oxidant compared to O2 suggests it may allow for lower regeneration temperatures, potentially improving catalytic performance by preventing overoxidation and maintaining catalyst dispersion.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对基于Cr和VOx的催化剂，包括：

1. 形成大块V2O5，降低选择性并有利于完全氧化。
2. 反应过程中VOx物种的聚集。
3. 表面碳的形成。

关于再生方法：

1. 与CO2相比，用O2再氧化能更有效地完全氧化催化剂。
2. CO2再氧化将V2O3氧化为V2O4，而O2可以进一步氧化为V2O5。
3. 在VOx催化的反应中添加CO2有助于减轻过度氧化，通过：
   a) 抑制表面碳的形成
   b) 部分氧化催化剂（氧化到V2O4而不是V2O5）
   c) 参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢

将WOx添加到VOx催化剂中可以通过以下方式改善性能：
1. 抑制反应过程中VOx物种的聚集
2. 在VOx物种之间充当物理屏障

虽然没有提到具体的温度要求，但CO2作为比O2更温和的氧化剂的有效性表明，它可能允许较低的再生温度，通过防止过度氧化和维持催化剂分散性，可能改善催化性能。
