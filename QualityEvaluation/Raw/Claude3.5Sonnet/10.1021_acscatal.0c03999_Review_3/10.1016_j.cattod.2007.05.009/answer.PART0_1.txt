<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain specific information about metal oxide catalyst deactivation causes, regeneration methods, or the effects of CO2 addition for VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The text focuses more broadly on various catalysts and reaction conditions for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation, but does not go into detail on the specific topics mentioned in the question. To properly address this question, additional sources with more targeted information on catalyst deactivation and regeneration would be needed.

所提供的文献并未包含关于金属氧化物催化剂失活原因、再生方法或CO2添加对氧化钒催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的影响等具体信息。该文本更广泛地关注了乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢的各种催化剂和反应条件,但未详细讨论问题中提到的具体主题。要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的、更有针对性的关于催化剂失活和再生的信息来源。
