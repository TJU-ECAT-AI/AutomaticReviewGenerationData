Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain specific information about the causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or comparisons of various regeneration methods. The text focuses primarily on general aspects of oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides, but does not discuss deactivation mechanisms or regeneration techniques in detail. Without relevant information from the given text, I cannot provide a substantive answer to this question.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain specific information about metal oxide catalyst deactivation causes, regeneration methods, or the effects of CO2 addition for VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The text focuses more broadly on various catalysts and reaction conditions for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation, but does not go into detail on the specific topics mentioned in the question. To properly address this question, additional sources with more targeted information on catalyst deactivation and regeneration would be needed.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain information specifically addressing the causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or comparisons of different regeneration methods. The text focuses more broadly on reviewing oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, covering topics like catalyst types, reaction mechanisms, and factors affecting selectivity. It does not go into detail about deactivation mechanisms or regeneration techniques for Cr-based or VOx catalysts used in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain specific information about the causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or details about regeneration methods. The text focuses more broadly on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, discussing various catalysts and their performance, but does not go into depth on deactivation mechanisms or regeneration techniques for Cr-based and VOx catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the given literature.
