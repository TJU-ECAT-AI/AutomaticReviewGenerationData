[1] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[3] "The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2.20 Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[4] "The 10wt% CrOx/SBA-15 and Ni-promoted 10wt% CrOx/SBA-15 samples were designated as Cr/Si and #NiCr/Si, respectively (in which # indicates the loading weight of Ni). We assumed that Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[5] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. CrOx reduction, specifically the conversion of active Cr3+ state to inactive Cr2+ state

Various regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. CO2 addition: 
- Helps maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state
- Enhances the oxidizing ability to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to active Cr3+ state
- Also aids in reoxidizing Cr3+ to Cr6+
- Does not significantly decrease selectivity

2. O2 addition:
- Decreases the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts
- However, significantly decreases selectivity for propylene

3. Ni promotion with CO2:
- Enhances CO2 conversion
- Maintains stable production of propylene
- Dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads
- Regenerates reduced Cr2+ species to Cr3+ through reoxidation
- Maintains stable catalytic activity

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for these regeneration methods or their impact on VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the addition of Ni as a promoter in combination with CO2 appears to be the most effective method for maintaining catalytic performance and mitigating deactivation in Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对铬基催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳沉积
2. CrOx还原，特别是活性Cr3+状态转化为非活性Cr2+状态

各种再生方法及其有效性：

1. CO2添加：
- 有助于将Cr维持在较高的氧化态
- 增强氧化能力，将还原的Cr2+重新氧化为活性Cr3+状态
- 还有助于将Cr3+重新氧化为Cr6+
- 不会显著降低选择性

2. O2添加：
- 降低CrOx/硅胶催化剂的失活速率
- 但显著降低了丙烯的选择性

3. 镍促进剂与CO2结合：
- 提高CO2转化率
- 保持丙烯的稳定产量
- 将CO2分解为CO和O*ads
- 通过再氧化将还原的Cr2+物种重新生成为Cr3+
- 保持稳定的催化活性

文献没有提供这些再生方法的具体温度要求或它们对VOx催化反应的影响。然而，在铬基催化剂的氧化脱氢过程中，添加镍作为促进剂并结合CO2似乎是保持催化性能和减缓失活最有效的方法。
