The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. Reduction of active CrOx species

The main issue is the conversion of the active Cr3+ state to the inactive Cr2+ state. 

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2: Helps maintain a higher oxidation state of surface Cr compared to its absence. However, it has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamic stability.

2. O2: Addition of a small amount of O2 as a co-feed with CO2 improves the oxidizing power and decreases the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts. However, this method significantly decreases the selectivity for propylene (C3H6).

3. Air: Not specifically mentioned in the given literature.

The effectiveness of these methods varies:

- CO2 is less effective due to its limited oxidizing ability.
- O2 is more effective in decreasing deactivation but at the cost of reduced selectivity.

Temperature requirements and specific impacts on catalytic performance are not detailed in the provided literature.

Regarding VOx-catalyzed reactions and the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation, the given literature does not provide specific information.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对基于铬的催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳沉积
2. 活性CrOx物种的还原

主要问题是活性Cr3+状态转化为非活性Cr2+状态。

关于再生方法：

1. CO2：与不存在CO2的情况相比，有助于维持表面Cr的较高氧化态。然而，由于其热力学稳定性，其氧化能力有限。

2. O2：作为CO2的共进料添加少量O2可以提高氧化能力，并降低CrOx/硅胶催化剂的失活速率。但是，这种方法显著降低了对丙烯（C3H6）的选择性。

3. 空气：在给定的文献中没有特别提及。

这些方法的有效性各不相同：

- CO2由于其有限的氧化能力而效果较差。
- O2在降低失活方面更有效，但代价是降低了选择性。

文献中没有详细说明温度要求和对催化性能的具体影响。

关于VOx催化反应以及CO2添加减轻过度氧化的潜力，给定的文献没有提供具体信息。
