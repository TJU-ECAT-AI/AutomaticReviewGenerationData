[1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[3] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[4] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[5] "Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. Reduction of active Cr3+ sites to inactive Cr2+ states

Various regeneration methods and their effectiveness:

1. CO2 reoxidation:
- Moderately effective in maintaining higher oxidation states of Cr
- Limited oxidizing ability due to thermodynamic stability
- Does not significantly decrease selectivity

2. O2 addition:
- More effective in decreasing catalyst deactivation rate
- Requires lower temperatures compared to CO2
- Significantly decreases selectivity for desired products (e.g., propylene)

3. Air reoxidation:
- Not explicitly mentioned, but likely similar to O2 addition

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation is not directly addressed for VOx-catalyzed reactions in this text. However, based on the information provided for Cr-based catalysts, CO2 addition might help maintain catalyst oxidation states while minimizing the decrease in selectivity compared to O2 or air.

Overall, while CO2 shows promise as a milder oxidant, its effectiveness is limited. O2 addition is more effective at regenerating the catalyst but at the cost of reduced selectivity. The ideal regeneration method would balance maintaining the active oxidation state of the catalyst while preserving selectivity for the desired products.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于基于铬的催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳沉积
2. 活性Cr3+位点还原为非活性Cr2+状态

各种再生方法及其有效性：

1. CO2再氧化：
- 在维持铬的较高氧化态方面有中等效果
- 由于热力学稳定性，氧化能力有限
- 不会显著降低选择性

2. O2添加：
- 在降低催化剂失活速率方面更为有效
- 与CO2相比，所需温度较低
- 显著降低了目标产物（如丙烯）的选择性

3. 空气再氧化：
- 文中未明确提及，但可能与O2添加类似

文中未直接涉及CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。然而，基于对铬基催化剂的信息，CO2添加可能有助于维持催化剂的氧化态，同时与O2或空气相比，最大程度地减少选择性降低。

总的来说，虽然CO2作为温和的氧化剂显示出潜力，但其效果有限。O2添加在催化剂再生方面更为有效，但代价是选择性降低。理想的再生方法应在维持催化剂活性氧化态和保持目标产物选择性之间取得平衡。
