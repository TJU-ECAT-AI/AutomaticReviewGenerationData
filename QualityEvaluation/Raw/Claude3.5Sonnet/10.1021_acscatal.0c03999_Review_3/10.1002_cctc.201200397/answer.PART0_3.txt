[1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[3] "The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[4] "By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. Reduction of active Cr3+ sites to inactive Cr2+ states

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 as a soft oxidant:
- Can eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase
- Has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamic stability
- More effective when promoted by Ni, which enhances CO2's ability to reoxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+

2. O2 addition:
- Decreases the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts
- However, significantly decreases the selectivity for propylene

The literature does not provide specific information on air regeneration or temperature requirements for these methods. It also does not discuss VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于基于铬的催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳沉积
2. 活性Cr3+位点还原为无活性Cr2+状态

关于再生方法：

1. CO2作为温和氧化剂：
- 可以消除积碳沉积并再氧化还原的活性相
- 由于其热力学稳定性，氧化能力有限
- 当用镍促进时更有效，镍增强了CO2将Cr2+再氧化为Cr3+以及Cr3+再氧化为Cr6+的能力

2. 添加O2：
- 降低CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂的失活速率
- 然而，显著降低了对丙烯的选择性

文献中没有提供关于空气再生或这些方法的温度要求的具体信息。它也没有讨论VOx催化剂或CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。
