[1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[3] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2."

[4] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Coke deposition
2. Reduction of active Cr3+ species to inactive Cr2+ species

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2: Can help maintain Cr in a higher oxidation state, but has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamic stability.

2. O2: Adding a small amount of O2 as a co-feed with CO2 can improve the oxidizing power and decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts. However, this may negatively impact selectivity.

3. Ni promotion: Adding Ni to Cr-based catalysts enhances CO2 activation, leading to the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads). This O*ads can regenerate reduced Cr2+ to active Cr3+, maintaining stable catalytic activity.

Temperature requirements and specific impacts on catalytic performance are not explicitly mentioned for these regeneration methods in the given literature.

The literature does not provide information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是对于基于铬的催化剂，包括：

1. 积碳沉积
2. 活性Cr3+物种还原为无活性Cr2+物种

关于再生方法：

1. CO2：可以帮助保持铬处于更高的氧化态，但由于其热力学稳定性，氧化能力有限。

2. O2：作为CO2的共进料添加少量O2可以提高氧化能力，降低CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂的失活速率。然而，这可能会对选择性产生负面影响。

3. Ni促进：向基于铬的催化剂中添加镍可以增强CO2的活化，导致CO2分解为CO和活性氧（O*ads）。这种O*ads可以将还原的Cr2+再生为活性Cr3+，保持稳定的催化活性。

文献中没有明确提及这些再生方法的温度要求和对催化性能的具体影响。

文献没有提供关于VOx催化剂或CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力的信息。
