The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Removal of surface carbonyl/carboxylic groups
2. Formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface

The literature does not provide detailed information on various regeneration methods or their comparative effectiveness for Cr-based catalysts. However, it mentions that the presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation. This suggests that CO2 may play a role in mitigating catalyst deactivation, though its exact mechanism and effectiveness are not fully explained.

The document does not provide information on VOx catalysts or specific regeneration methods using air or O2. It also does not discuss temperature requirements for regeneration or the impact of these methods on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not addressed in the given literature.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 表面羰基/羧基基团的去除
2. 催化剂表面形成无活性的焦炭

文献没有提供关于各种再生方法或它们对铬基催化剂的相对有效性的详细信息。然而，它提到在进料中存在CO2部分保护了基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。这表明CO2可能在减缓催化剂失活方面发挥作用，尽管其确切机制和有效性没有得到充分解释。

文档没有提供关于VOx催化剂或使用空气或O2的特定再生方法的信息。它也没有讨论再生的温度要求或这些方法对催化性能的影响。给定的文献中没有涉及CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的缓解潜力。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Removal of oxygen-containing surface species: The catalytic reaction leads to a significant reduction in oxygen-containing surface species, particularly carbonyl and carboxyl groups, which play a role in the catalytic process.

2. Formation of carbonaceous deposits: Inactive coke forms on the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation process, encapsulating the active chromium oxide phase.

3. Poisoning or decomposition of acid sites: The cracking process, which is catalyzed by acidic surface sites, experiences faster deactivation, suggesting these sites are preferentially affected.

Regarding regeneration methods:

The study primarily focuses on the use of CO2 rather than comparing various regeneration methods. However, it suggests that CO2 has some limited benefits:

1. CO2 partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by preserving some oxygen-containing surface species.

2. CO2 is a milder oxidizing agent compared to air, with gasification of the carbon support by CO2 beginning at higher temperatures (around 650-690°C) than oxidation in air.

3. The presence of CO2 in the feed does not prevent deactivation entirely, as the catalysts still experience activity loss over time.

The study does not provide detailed information on reoxidation with air or O2, or their comparative effectiveness in regeneration. It also does not specifically address VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 含氧表面物种的移除：催化反应导致含氧表面物种，特别是羰基和羧基基团的显著减少，这些基团在催化过程中起重要作用。

2. 碳质沉积物的形成：在脱氢过程中，催化剂表面形成惰性焦炭，包覆活性铬氧化物相。

3. 酸性位点的中毒或分解：裂解过程由酸性表面位点催化，这些位点经历更快的失活，表明它们受到优先影响。

关于再生方法：

这项研究主要集中于CO2的使用，而不是比较各种再生方法。然而，它表明CO2有一些有限的好处：

1. CO2通过保留一些含氧表面物种，部分保护了基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。

2. 与空气相比，CO2是一种更温和的氧化剂，CO2对碳载体的气化始于更高的温度（约650-690°C），而在空气中的氧化温度较低。

3. 进料中存在CO2并不能完全防止失活，因为催化剂仍然随时间推移而失去活性。

这项研究没有提供关于用空气或O2再氧化的详细信息，也没有比较它们在再生方面的有效性。它也没有特别提及VOx催化剂，或CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在影响。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Decomposition of active centers: The removal of carbonyl and carboxyl groups on the catalyst surface leads to a loss of catalytic activity over time.

2. Formation of carbonaceous deposits: Inactive coke forms on the catalyst surface, encapsulating the active chromium oxide phase and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

3. Poisoning of acid sites: The cracking process, which is catalyzed by acidic surface sites, experiences faster deactivation, suggesting these sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed during the reaction.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation. This suggests that CO2 may have a mild regenerative effect, though it is not explicitly described as a regeneration method in the text.

2. Air oxidation: The text mentions that samples were tested in air atmosphere, which led to oxidation of the catalyst. This could potentially be used as a regeneration method, but its effectiveness is not directly discussed.

3. Temperature requirements: The text indicates that oxidation of the fresh Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst in air begins at temperatures as low as 300°C, while reaction with CO2 starts around 650°C. This suggests that air oxidation might be more effective at lower temperatures compared to CO2 treatment.

The document does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different regeneration methods or their impact on catalytic performance. It also does not discuss VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 活性中心的分解：催化剂表面的羰基和羧基群的移除导致催化活性随时间降低。

2. 碳质沉积物的形成：在催化剂表面形成的惰性焦炭包覆了活性铬氧化物相，降低了催化剂的有效性。

3. 酸性位点的中毒：裂解过程由酸性表面位点催化，这些位点的失活速度更快，表明在反应过程中这些位点优先被中毒或分解。

关于再生方法：

1. 添加CO2：在进料中存在CO2部分保护了基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。这表明CO2可能具有温和的再生效果，尽管文中并未明确将其描述为再生方法。

2. 空气氧化：文中提到样品在空气氛围中进行了测试，导致催化剂发生氧化。这可能被用作再生方法，但其有效性并未直接讨论。

3. 温度要求：文中指出，新鲜的Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在空气中的氧化从300°C左右开始，而与CO2的反应从650°C左右开始。这表明相比于CO2处理，空气氧化在较低温度下可能更有效。

该文档未提供不同再生方法的有效性或它们对催化性能影响的具体信息。它也没有讨论VOx催化剂或CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups from the catalyst surface
2. Formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface

The study primarily focused on CO2 as a regeneration agent. However, CO2 was found to be too mild of an oxidizing agent to effectively remove carbonaceous deposits. The temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for CO2 to react with the active carbon support.

The effectiveness of CO2 in regeneration appears limited. Higher temperatures would be required for CO2 to be effective in gasification of coke deposits. 

The study did not provide direct comparisons between different regeneration methods such as air or O2. However, it was noted that the presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation, suggesting some mitigating effect.

The impact of CO2 addition on catalytic performance was mixed. While it increased initial activity and selectivity, it also led to faster deactivation due to higher propene yield, which can be a precursor for coke formation.

The study did not specifically address VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 催化剂表面羰基/羧基基团的移除
2. 催化剂表面惰性焦炭的形成

该研究主要关注CO2作为再生剂。然而，发现CO2作为氧化剂太温和，无法有效去除碳质沉积物。在催化实验中使用的温度太低，CO2无法与活性碳载体反应。

CO2在再生方面的有效性似乎有限。需要更高的温度才能使CO2有效地气化焦炭沉积物。

该研究没有直接比较不同的再生方法，如空气或O2。但是，注意到在进料中存在CO2部分保护了基于活性碳的催化剂免于失活，这表明有一些缓解作用。

CO2添加对催化性能的影响是复杂的。虽然它提高了初始活性和选择性，但由于丙烯产率较高（丙烯可能是焦炭形成的前体），也导致了更快的失活。

该研究没有具体讨论VOx催化剂或CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。
