[1] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."

[2] "It should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-stream."

[3] "The cracking process is commonly catalyzed by acidic surface sites. Therefore, it could be suspected that during the reaction acid sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed."

[4] "It is clear that an amount of oxygen-containing surface species was drastically reduced during the catalytic reaction."

[5] "Apart from the decomposition of active centers, a formation of carbonaceous deposit encapsulating the active phase of chromium oxide can be a reason of the catalyst deactivation."

[6] "An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process."

[7] "Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Removal of oxygen-containing surface species: The catalytic reaction leads to a significant reduction in oxygen-containing surface species, particularly carbonyl and carboxyl groups, which play a role in the catalytic process.

2. Formation of carbonaceous deposits: Inactive coke forms on the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation process, encapsulating the active chromium oxide phase.

3. Poisoning or decomposition of acid sites: The cracking process, which is catalyzed by acidic surface sites, experiences faster deactivation, suggesting these sites are preferentially affected.

Regarding regeneration methods:

The study primarily focuses on the use of CO2 rather than comparing various regeneration methods. However, it suggests that CO2 has some limited benefits:

1. CO2 partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation by preserving some oxygen-containing surface species.

2. CO2 is a milder oxidizing agent compared to air, with gasification of the carbon support by CO2 beginning at higher temperatures (around 650-690°C) than oxidation in air.

3. The presence of CO2 in the feed does not prevent deactivation entirely, as the catalysts still experience activity loss over time.

The study does not provide detailed information on reoxidation with air or O2, or their comparative effectiveness in regeneration. It also does not specifically address VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 含氧表面物种的移除：催化反应导致含氧表面物种，特别是羰基和羧基基团的显著减少，这些基团在催化过程中起重要作用。

2. 碳质沉积物的形成：在脱氢过程中，催化剂表面形成惰性焦炭，包覆活性铬氧化物相。

3. 酸性位点的中毒或分解：裂解过程由酸性表面位点催化，这些位点经历更快的失活，表明它们受到优先影响。

关于再生方法：

这项研究主要集中于CO2的使用，而不是比较各种再生方法。然而，它表明CO2有一些有限的好处：

1. CO2通过保留一些含氧表面物种，部分保护了基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。

2. 与空气相比，CO2是一种更温和的氧化剂，CO2对碳载体的气化始于更高的温度（约650-690°C），而在空气中的氧化温度较低。

3. 进料中存在CO2并不能完全防止失活，因为催化剂仍然随时间推移而失去活性。

这项研究没有提供关于用空气或O2再氧化的详细信息，也没有比较它们在再生方面的有效性。它也没有特别提及VOx催化剂，或CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在影响。
