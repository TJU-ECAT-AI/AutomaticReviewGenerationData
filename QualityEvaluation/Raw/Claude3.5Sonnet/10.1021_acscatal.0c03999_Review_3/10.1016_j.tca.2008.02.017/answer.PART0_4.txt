[1] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."

[2] "It should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-stream."

[3] "The produced propene can be a precursor of inactive coke deposited on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, CO2 is too mild oxidizing agent to remove effectively the carbonaceous deposit."

[4] "It should therefore be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups from the catalyst surface
2. Formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface

The study primarily focused on CO2 as a regeneration agent. However, CO2 was found to be too mild of an oxidizing agent to effectively remove carbonaceous deposits. The temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for CO2 to react with the active carbon support.

The effectiveness of CO2 in regeneration appears limited. Higher temperatures would be required for CO2 to be effective in gasification of coke deposits. 

The study did not provide direct comparisons between different regeneration methods such as air or O2. However, it was noted that the presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation, suggesting some mitigating effect.

The impact of CO2 addition on catalytic performance was mixed. While it increased initial activity and selectivity, it also led to faster deactivation due to higher propene yield, which can be a precursor for coke formation.

The study did not specifically address VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 催化剂表面羰基/羧基基团的移除
2. 催化剂表面惰性焦炭的形成

该研究主要关注CO2作为再生剂。然而，发现CO2作为氧化剂太温和，无法有效去除碳质沉积物。在催化实验中使用的温度太低，CO2无法与活性碳载体反应。

CO2在再生方面的有效性似乎有限。需要更高的温度才能使CO2有效地气化焦炭沉积物。

该研究没有直接比较不同的再生方法，如空气或O2。但是，注意到在进料中存在CO2部分保护了基于活性碳的催化剂免于失活，这表明有一些缓解作用。

CO2添加对催化性能的影响是复杂的。虽然它提高了初始活性和选择性，但由于丙烯产率较高（丙烯可能是焦炭形成的前体），也导致了更快的失活。

该研究没有具体讨论VOx催化剂或CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。
