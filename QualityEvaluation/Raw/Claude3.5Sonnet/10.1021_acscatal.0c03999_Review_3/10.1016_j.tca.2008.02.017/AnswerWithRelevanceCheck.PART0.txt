          [1] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."

[2] "It should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-stream."

[3] "The produced propene can be a precursor of inactive coke deposited on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Taking into account the catalytic role of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the conversion of propane it should therefore be concluded that the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."

[5] "Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."

[6] "The cracking process is commonly catalyzed by acidic surface sites. Therefore, it could be suspected that during the reaction acid sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed."

[7] "Apart from the decomposition of active centers, a formation of carbonaceous deposit encapsulating the active phase of chromium oxide can be a reason of the catalyst deactivation."

[8] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are:

1. Removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups from the catalyst surface
2. Formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface, encapsulating the active chromium oxide phase
3. Poisoning or decomposition of acidic surface sites

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation. However, CO2 is too mild an oxidizing agent to effectively remove carbonaceous deposits at the temperatures used in the catalytic experiments.

2. Temperature requirements: The study indicates that higher temperatures would be required for CO2 to be effective in gasification of coke deposits. The text mentions that oxidation of the fresh Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst in air begins at temperatures as low as 300°C, while reaction with CO2 starts around 650°C.

3. Effectiveness: The effectiveness of CO2 in regeneration appears limited. The study does not provide direct comparisons between different regeneration methods such as air or O2.

4. Impact on catalytic performance: The impact of CO2 addition on catalytic performance was mixed. While it increased initial activity and selectivity, it also led to faster deactivation due to higher propene yield, which can be a precursor for coke formation.

The study does not provide specific information on VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

          在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 催化剂表面羰基/羧基基团的移除
2. 催化剂表面惰性焦炭的形成，包覆活性铬氧化物相
3. 酸性表面位点的中毒或分解

关于再生方法：

1. CO2添加：在进料中存在CO2部分保护了基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。然而，在催化实验所用的温度下，CO2作为氧化剂太温和，无法有效去除碳质沉积物。

2. 温度要求：研究表明，需要更高的温度才能使CO2有效地气化焦炭沉积物。文中提到，新鲜的Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在空气中的氧化从300°C左右开始，而与CO2的反应从650°C左右开始。

3. 有效性：CO2在再生方面的有效性似乎有限。该研究没有直接比较不同的再生方法，如空气或O2。

4. 对催化性能的影响：CO2添加对催化性能的影响是复杂的。虽然它提高了初始活性和选择性，但由于丙烯产率较高（丙烯可能是焦炭形成的前体），也导致了更快的失活。

该研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂的具体信息，也没有讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。
