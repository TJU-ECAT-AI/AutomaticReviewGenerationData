[1] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."

[2] "It should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-stream."

[3] "The produced propene can be a precursor of inactive coke deposited on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Taking into account the catalytic role of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the conversion of propane it should therefore be concluded that the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."

[5] "Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Removal of surface carbonyl/carboxylic groups
2. Formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface

The literature does not provide detailed information on various regeneration methods or their comparative effectiveness for Cr-based catalysts. However, it mentions that the presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation. This suggests that CO2 may play a role in mitigating catalyst deactivation, though its exact mechanism and effectiveness are not fully explained.

The document does not provide information on VOx catalysts or specific regeneration methods using air or O2. It also does not discuss temperature requirements for regeneration or the impact of these methods on catalytic performance. The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not addressed in the given literature.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 表面羰基/羧基基团的去除
2. 催化剂表面形成无活性的焦炭

文献没有提供关于各种再生方法或它们对铬基催化剂的相对有效性的详细信息。然而，它提到在进料中存在CO2部分保护了基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。这表明CO2可能在减缓催化剂失活方面发挥作用，尽管其确切机制和有效性没有得到充分解释。

文档没有提供关于VOx催化剂或使用空气或O2的特定再生方法的信息。它也没有讨论再生的温度要求或这些方法对催化性能的影响。给定的文献中没有涉及CO2添加对VOx催化反应中过度氧化的缓解潜力。
