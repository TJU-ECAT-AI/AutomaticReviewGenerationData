[1] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."

[2] "It should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-stream."

[3] "The cracking process is commonly catalyzed by acidic surface sites. Therefore, it could be suspected that during the reaction acid sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed."

[4] "Taking into account the catalytic role of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the conversion of propane it should therefore be concluded that the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."

[5] "Apart from the decomposition of active centers, a formation of carbonaceous deposit encapsulating the active phase of chromium oxide can be a reason of the catalyst deactivation."

[6] "Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, include:

1. Decomposition of active centers: The removal of carbonyl and carboxyl groups on the catalyst surface leads to a loss of catalytic activity over time.

2. Formation of carbonaceous deposits: Inactive coke forms on the catalyst surface, encapsulating the active chromium oxide phase and reducing catalyst effectiveness.

3. Poisoning of acid sites: The cracking process, which is catalyzed by acidic surface sites, experiences faster deactivation, suggesting these sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed during the reaction.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: The presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation. This suggests that CO2 may have a mild regenerative effect, though it is not explicitly described as a regeneration method in the text.

2. Air oxidation: The text mentions that samples were tested in air atmosphere, which led to oxidation of the catalyst. This could potentially be used as a regeneration method, but its effectiveness is not directly discussed.

3. Temperature requirements: The text indicates that oxidation of the fresh Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst in air begins at temperatures as low as 300°C, while reaction with CO2 starts around 650°C. This suggests that air oxidation might be more effective at lower temperatures compared to CO2 treatment.

The document does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different regeneration methods or their impact on catalytic performance. It also does not discuss VOx catalysts or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 活性中心的分解：催化剂表面的羰基和羧基群的移除导致催化活性随时间降低。

2. 碳质沉积物的形成：在催化剂表面形成的惰性焦炭包覆了活性铬氧化物相，降低了催化剂的有效性。

3. 酸性位点的中毒：裂解过程由酸性表面位点催化，这些位点的失活速度更快，表明在反应过程中这些位点优先被中毒或分解。

关于再生方法：

1. 添加CO2：在进料中存在CO2部分保护了基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。这表明CO2可能具有温和的再生效果，尽管文中并未明确将其描述为再生方法。

2. 空气氧化：文中提到样品在空气氛围中进行了测试，导致催化剂发生氧化。这可能被用作再生方法，但其有效性并未直接讨论。

3. 温度要求：文中指出，新鲜的Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在空气中的氧化从300°C左右开始，而与CO2的反应从650°C左右开始。这表明相比于CO2处理，空气氧化在较低温度下可能更有效。

该文档未提供不同再生方法的有效性或它们对催化性能影响的具体信息。它也没有讨论VOx催化剂或CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减轻过度氧化的潜力。
