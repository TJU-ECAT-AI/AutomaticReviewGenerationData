[1] "Unfortunately, the studied active carbon-based catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."

[2] "It should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-stream."

[3] "The produced propene can be a precursor of inactive coke deposited on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Taking into account the catalytic role of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the conversion of propane it should therefore be concluded that the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."

[5] "Therefore, it should be concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based catalysts, are:

1. Removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups from the catalyst surface
2. Formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface

The study does not provide comprehensive information on various regeneration methods or their effectiveness for Cr-based catalysts. However, it does mention that the presence of CO2 in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation. This suggests that CO2 may have some regenerative properties, though its effectiveness is limited.

The study does not provide information on VOx catalysts or the impact of different regeneration methods on catalytic performance. It also does not discuss temperature requirements for regeneration or the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于铬的催化剂）失活的主要原因是：

1. 催化剂表面羰基/羧基基团的移除
2. 催化剂表面惰性焦炭的形成

这项研究没有提供关于各种再生方法或它们对铬基催化剂有效性的全面信息。然而，它确实提到在进料中存在CO2可以部分保护基于活性炭的催化剂免于失活。这表明CO2可能具有一些再生特性，尽管其效果有限。

该研究没有提供关于VOx催化剂的信息，也没有讨论不同再生方法对催化性能的影响。它也没有讨论再生的温度要求，或CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在影响。
