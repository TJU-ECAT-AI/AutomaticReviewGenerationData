[1] "Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors."

[3] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[4] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The abstraction of allylic hydrogen from produced alkenes leads to rapid formation of coke precursors, causing catalyst deactivation.

2. Reduction of metal species: The catalysts tend to be reduced during the reaction, lowering their oxidation state and catalytic activity.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: CO2 helps maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species, which is crucial for high catalytic activities. It appears to be effective in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by keeping the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2.

2. Temperature requirements: The study does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration methods. However, it mentions that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K for C3 and C4 alkanes) help maintain vanadium oxide in high oxidation states.

3. Effectiveness and impact on catalytic performance: The addition of CO2 shows a promoting effect on alkane conversion and alkene yields, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. It also helps reduce carbon deposition on the catalyst surface.

While the document does not directly compare air or O2 regeneration methods, it suggests that CO2 addition during the reaction process can effectively maintain catalyst activity by preserving higher oxidation states of metal species and reducing coke formation.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 焦炭形成：从生成的烯烃中提取烯丙基氢导致焦炭前体的快速形成，造成催化剂失活。

2. 金属物种还原：催化剂在反应过程中倾向于被还原，降低其氧化态和催化活性。

关于再生方法：

1. 添加CO2：CO2有助于维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化态，这对于保持高催化活性至关重要。它似乎能有效减少VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，通过保持V2O5和Cr2O3表面在相对无CO2反应略高的氧化态。

2. 温度要求：研究没有提供再生方法的具体温度要求信息。然而，它提到较低的反应温度（C3和C4烷烃低于893 K）有助于保持钒氧化物在高氧化态。

3. 有效性和对催化性能的影响：添加CO2显示出对烷烃转化和烯烃产率的促进作用，特别是在丙烷脱氢中。它还有助于减少催化剂表面的碳沉积。

虽然文档没有直接比较空气或O2再生方法，但它表明在反应过程中添加CO2可以通过保持金属物种的较高氧化态和减少焦炭形成来有效维持催化剂活性。
