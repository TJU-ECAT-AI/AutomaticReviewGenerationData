[1] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields."

[2] "CO2 slightly oxidized vanadium species during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[3] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

[4] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has a lower bond dissociation energy than the starting alkanes. This leads to rapid hydrogen abstraction from the allylic position, resulting in coke precursors and catalyst deactivation.

2. Reduction of metal species: During the reaction, the metal species (Cr and V) can be reduced from their higher oxidation states, which are crucial for catalytic activity.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species. This helps preserve catalytic activity and mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. CO2 slightly oxidizes vanadium species during the reaction, which is beneficial for maintaining catalyst performance.

2. Reoxidation with air or O2: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, these methods are commonly used for catalyst regeneration. They likely operate at higher temperatures than CO2 and may risk over-oxidation of the catalyst.

The effectiveness of CO2 as a regeneration agent is highlighted by its ability to maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species without causing overoxidation. This is particularly important for VOx catalysts, where maintaining the balance between different oxidation states is crucial for optimal performance.

Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it's noted that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K for C3 and C4 alkanes) help maintain vanadium oxide in higher oxidation states, suggesting that regeneration temperatures should be carefully controlled to balance effective reoxidation with prevention of thermal degradation.

In summary, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for mitigating catalyst deactivation and maintaining performance, particularly for VOx catalysts, by preserving the higher oxidation states of the metal species without risking overoxidation.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 结焦形成：生成的烯烃含有烯丙基氢，其键解离能比起始烷烃低。这导致烯丙基位置的氢快速被抽取，形成焦炭前体物，使催化剂失活。

2. 金属物种还原：在反应过程中，金属物种（Cr和V）可能从高氧化态被还原，而高氧化态对催化活性至关重要。

关于再生方法：

1. CO2添加：CO2显示出在保持铬和钒物种高氧化态方面的有效性。这有助于保持催化活性并减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。CO2在反应过程中轻微氧化钒物种，这有利于保持催化剂性能。

2. 空气或O2再氧化：虽然在给定文本中未明确提及，但这些方法常用于催化剂再生。它们可能在比CO2更高的温度下操作，并可能存在催化剂过度氧化的风险。

CO2作为再生剂的有效性体现在它能够保持金属物种的高氧化态，同时不会导致过度氧化。这对VOx催化剂尤为重要，因为保持不同氧化态之间的平衡对最佳性能至关重要。

文本中未明确说明再生的温度要求。然而，值得注意的是，较低的反应温度（C3和C4烷烃低于893 K）有助于保持钒氧化物处于较高的氧化态，这表明应该仔细控制再生温度，以平衡有效的再氧化和防止热降解。

总之，CO2添加似乎是一种有效的方法，可以减缓催化剂失活并保持性能，特别是对于VOx催化剂，通过保持金属物种的较高氧化态而不会导致过度氧化。
