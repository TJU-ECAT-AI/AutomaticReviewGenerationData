[1] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields."

[2] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "The peak of Cr6+ after dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 slightly strengthened as compared to that reacted in the presence of Ar. This result indicates that the chromium oxide could sustain a higher oxidation state."

[4] "However, the V5+ peak of 400 nm in the presence of Ar was slightly weaker than that in the presence of CO2. This result indicated that CO2 slightly oxidized vanadium species during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coking: The formation of coke precursors due to rapid abstraction of hydrogen from allylic positions in higher alkenes, leading to catalyst deactivation and decreased alkene yields.

2. Reduction of metal oxides: The active metal species (Cr and V) can be reduced from their higher oxidation states during the reaction, decreasing catalytic activity.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of both Cr and V species during reactions. It helps keep the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2.

2. Temperature requirements: The study does not provide specific temperature requirements for regeneration. However, it notes that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K) help maintain vanadium oxide in high oxidation states.

3. Impact on catalytic performance: CO2 addition has a positive impact on catalytic performance by:
   - Promoting the dehydrogenation reaction
   - Maintaining higher oxidation states of active metal species
   - Potentially mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2

4. Effectiveness comparison: The study does not directly compare the effectiveness of different regeneration methods like air or O2. However, it emphasizes the benefits of using CO2 as a mild oxidant to maintain catalyst activity and selectivity.

In summary, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for catalyst regeneration and performance enhancement, particularly for maintaining the desired oxidation states of Cr and V species in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 结焦：由于高级烯烃中烯丙基氢的快速抽提，导致结焦前体物的形成，从而引起催化剂失活和烯烃产率下降。

2. 金属氧化物还原：活性金属物种（Cr和V）在反应过程中可能从高氧化态被还原，降低催化活性。

关于再生方法：

1. CO2添加：CO2显示出在反应过程中维持Cr和V物种较高氧化态的有效性。它有助于保持V2O5和Cr2O3表面处于略高于无CO2反应时的氧化状态。

2. 温度要求：研究没有提供具体的再生温度要求。但指出较低的反应温度（低于893 K）有助于维持钒氧化物的高氧化态。

3. 对催化性能的影响：CO2添加对催化性能有积极影响：
   - 促进脱氢反应
   - 维持活性金属物种的高氧化态
   - 通过提供比O2更温和的氧化环境，可能减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化

4. 效果比较：该研究没有直接比较不同再生方法（如空气或O2）的效果。但强调了使用CO2作为温和氧化剂维持催化剂活性和选择性的好处。

总之，CO2添加似乎是一种有效的催化剂再生和性能增强方法，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中维持Cr和V物种所需的氧化态。
