[1] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields."

[2] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "The peak of Cr6+ after dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 slightly strengthened as compared to that reacted in the presence of Ar. This result indicates that the chromium oxide could sustain a higher oxidation state."

[4] "However, the V5+ peak of 400 nm in the presence of Ar was slightly weaker than that in the presence of CO2. This result indicated that CO2 slightly oxidized vanadium species during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coking: The formation of coke precursors due to rapid abstraction of hydrogen from allylic positions in higher alkenes, leading to catalyst deactivation and decreased alkene yields.

2. Reduction of metal oxides: The active metal species (Cr and V) can be reduced from their higher oxidation states during the reaction, decreasing catalytic activity.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of both Cr and V species during reactions. It helps keep the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2.

2. Temperature requirements: The study does not provide specific temperature requirements for regeneration. However, it notes that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K) help maintain vanadium oxide in high oxidation states.

3. Impact on catalytic performance: CO2 addition has a positive impact on catalytic performance by:
   - Promoting the dehydrogenation reaction
   - Maintaining higher oxidation states of active metal species
   - Potentially mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2

4. Effectiveness comparison: The study does not directly compare the effectiveness of different regeneration methods like air or O2. However, it emphasizes the benefits of using CO2 as a mild oxidant to maintain catalyst activity and selectivity.

In summary, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for catalyst regeneration and performance enhancement, particularly for maintaining the desired oxidation states of Cr and V species in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

2. 温度要求：研究没有提供具体的再生温度要求。但指出较低的反应温度（低于893 K）有助于维持钒氧化物的高氧化态。

3. 对催化性能的影响：CO2添加对催化性能有积极影响：
   - 促进脱氢反应
   - 维持活性金属物种的高氧化态
   - 通过提供比O2更温和的氧化环境，可能减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化

4. 效果比较：该研究没有直接比较不同再生方法（如空气或O2）的效果。但强调了使用CO2作为温和氧化剂维持催化剂活性和选择性的好处。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Coke formation: The produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has a lower bond dissociation energy than the starting alkanes. This leads to faster hydrogen abstraction from the allylic position, resulting in coke precursors and catalyst deactivation.

2. Reduction of metal oxides: During the reaction, the metal oxides can be reduced to lower oxidation states, which may decrease their catalytic activity.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of both Cr and V species during the reaction. It keeps the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2. This method is effective at the reaction temperature and does not require additional heating.

2. Reoxidation with air or O2: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, these are common methods for regenerating reduced metal oxide catalysts. They would likely be more effective than CO2 in fully reoxidizing the catalyst but may require higher temperatures and could potentially lead to overoxidation.

The impact of CO2 addition on catalytic performance includes:

1. Maintaining catalyst activity: By keeping the metal oxides in a higher oxidation state, CO2 helps maintain catalyst activity over time.

2. Mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions: The text doesn't directly address this, but the ability of CO2 to maintain a slightly higher oxidation state without fully oxidizing the catalyst suggests it could help balance the oxidation state and potentially mitigate overoxidation.

3. Promoting dehydrogenation: The presence of CO2 was shown to increase alkene yields in several cases, particularly for propane dehydrogenation.

Overall, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for maintaining catalyst activity and potentially extending catalyst lifetime, while also promoting the desired dehydrogenation reactions.

在氧化脱氢过程中，以Cr基和VOx催化剂为重点的金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括：

1. 积碳形成：生成的烯烃含有烯丙基氢，其键解离能比起始烷烃低。这导致烯丙基位置的氢更快被抽取，形成积碳前体，使催化剂失活。

2. 金属氧化物还原：在反应过程中，金属氧化物可能被还原为较低的氧化态，可能降低其催化活性。

关于再生方法：

1. 添加CO2：CO2在反应过程中能有效地维持Cr和V物种的较高氧化态。与无CO2反应相比，它使表面V2O5和Cr2O3保持在略高的氧化态。这种方法在反应温度下有效，不需要额外加热。

2. 用空气或O2再氧化：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但这些是再生还原金属氧化物催化剂的常用方法。它们在完全再氧化催化剂方面可能比CO2更有效，但可能需要更高的温度，并可能导致过度氧化。

CO2添加对催化性能的影响包括：

1. 保持催化剂活性：通过将金属氧化物保持在较高的氧化态，CO2有助于长期保持催化剂活性。

2. 减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化：虽然文本没有直接涉及这一点，但CO2能够维持略高的氧化态而不完全氧化催化剂，这表明它可能有助于平衡氧化态，潜在地减轻过度氧化。

3. 促进脱氢：在多个案例中，CO2的存在被证明可以增加烯烃产率，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中。

总的来说，添加CO2似乎是一种有效的方法，可以维持催化剂活性，可能延长催化剂寿命，同时还能促进所需的脱氢反应。

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. CO2 addition: CO2 has shown effectiveness in maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species. This helps preserve catalytic activity and mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. CO2 slightly oxidizes vanadium species during the reaction, which is beneficial for maintaining catalyst performance.

2. Reoxidation with air or O2: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, these methods are commonly used for catalyst regeneration. They likely operate at higher temperatures than CO2 and may risk over-oxidation of the catalyst.

The effectiveness of CO2 as a regeneration agent is highlighted by its ability to maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species without causing overoxidation. This is particularly important for VOx catalysts, where maintaining the balance between different oxidation states is crucial for optimal performance.

Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it's noted that lower reaction temperatures (below 893 K for C3 and C4 alkanes) help maintain vanadium oxide in higher oxidation states, suggesting that regeneration temperatures should be carefully controlled to balance effective reoxidation with prevention of thermal degradation.

In summary, CO2 addition appears to be an effective method for mitigating catalyst deactivation and maintaining performance, particularly for VOx catalysts, by preserving the higher oxidation states of the metal species without risking overoxidation.
