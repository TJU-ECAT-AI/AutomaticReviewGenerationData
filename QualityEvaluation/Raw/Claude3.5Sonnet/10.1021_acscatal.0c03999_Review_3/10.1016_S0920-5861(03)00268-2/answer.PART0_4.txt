[1] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contains allylic hydrogen, which has much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to give coke precursors. Deactivation of the catalyst could not be avoided, consequently giving decreases in alkene yields."

[2] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, especially for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is coke formation. This occurs due to the abstraction of allylic hydrogen from produced alkenes, which have lower bond dissociation energies compared to the starting alkanes. The rapid formation of coke precursors leads to catalyst deactivation and decreased alkene yields.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature suggests that CO2 addition can be effective in maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species, which is crucial for high catalytic activities. CO2 keeps the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2. This suggests that CO2 can act as a mild oxidant, potentially mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions while still maintaining catalyst activity.

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or comparative effectiveness of different regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air or O2. However, it implies that the continuous presence of CO2 during the reaction can help maintain catalyst activity by preserving higher oxidation states of the active metal species.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因是焦炭形成。这是由于从生成的烯烃中提取烯丙基氢所致，这些烯烃的键解离能比起始烷烃低。焦炭前体的快速形成导致催化剂失活和烯烃产率降低。

关于再生方法，文献表明添加CO2可以有效地维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化态，这对于保持高催化活性至关重要。CO2使V2O5和Cr2O3表面保持在比无CO2反应时略高的氧化态。这表明CO2可以作为一种温和的氧化剂，可能在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化，同时仍保持催化剂活性。

文献没有提供关于再生温度要求或不同再生方法（如用空气或O2再氧化）的比较效果的具体信息。然而，它暗示在反应过程中持续存在CO2可以通过保持活性金属物种的较高氧化态来帮助维持催化剂活性。
