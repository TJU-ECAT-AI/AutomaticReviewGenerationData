[1] "The initial conversion was close to 14%, but declined rapidly with increasing TOS. Finally, the catalyst attained a steady state, with 6% conversion, due to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "The hypothesis of coke accumulation on the catalyst during anaerobic operation is supported by various experimental evidence"

[3] "This indicates the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Further evidence of the formation of coke under anaerobic conditions was provided by the Raman spectra of spent catalysts (i.e., analyzed after the reducing step)."

[5] "Furthermore, during the half-cycle reoxidation step for the reduced catalyst, the formation of CO2, along with minor amounts of CO, was observed. The formation of these compounds was greatest during the first 810 min of treatment and became practically nil after approximately 15 min."

The primary cause of deactivation for VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes appears to be coke accumulation, based on the evidence presented in the literature. 

Regarding regeneration methods, the study primarily discusses reoxidation with air. This method was shown to be effective in removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The reoxidation process was carried out at 550°C and resulted in the formation of CO2 and small amounts of CO, with most of the regeneration occurring within the first 8-10 minutes.

The effectiveness of the regeneration was demonstrated by the ability to run multiple reduction-oxidation cycles, though there was a slight decrease in activity after the first cycle. This could be due to incomplete reoxidation, incomplete coke removal, or some structural changes in the catalyst due to the high temperatures during oxidation.

The literature does not provide information on regeneration with CO2 or pure O2, nor does it discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, a comparison of these methods cannot be made based on the given information.

根据文献中提供的证据，VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因似乎是积碳。

关于再生方法，该研究主要讨论了用空气再氧化。这种方法被证明能有效去除积碳并恢复催化剂活性。再氧化过程在550°C下进行，产生CO2和少量CO，大部分再生在前8-10分钟内完成。

再生的有效性通过能够进行多次还原-氧化循环来证明，尽管第一次循环后活性略有下降。这可能是由于不完全再氧化、不完全积碳去除，或由于氧化过程中高温导致的催化剂结构变化。

文献没有提供关于用CO2或纯O2再生的信息，也没有讨论CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在影响。因此，基于给定信息无法对这些方法进行比较。
