[1] "This indicates the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface."

[2] "Further evidence of the formation of coke under anaerobic conditions was provided by the Raman spectra of spent catalysts (i.e., analyzed after the reducing step). Typical Raman features associated with the presence of coke were observed (Fig. 13)."

[3] "Furthermore, during the half-cycle reoxidation step for the reduced catalyst, the formation of CO2, along with minor amounts of CO, was observed. The formation of these compounds was greatest during the first 810 min of treatment and became practically nil after approximately 15 min."

[4] "This effect can be attributed to incomplete reoxidation of the reduced vanadium species, to incomplete removal of coke, or again to some rearrangement of the V oxide structure as a consequence of the highly exothermal oxidation treatment and the high local temperature developing on the catalyst surface during this treatment."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts as discussed in this literature, is coke formation. This is evidenced by the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, as observed through Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature primarily discusses reoxidation with air. This method appears to be effective in removing coke and reoxidizing reduced vanadium species, as indicated by the formation of CO2 and CO during the reoxidation step. The regeneration process is most active in the first 8-10 minutes and is essentially complete after 15 minutes.

However, the regeneration process may not be fully effective or may have some drawbacks. The literature mentions potential incomplete reoxidation of reduced vanadium species and incomplete removal of coke. Additionally, there is a possibility of rearrangement of the V oxide structure due to the highly exothermic nature of the oxidation treatment and the high local temperatures that develop on the catalyst surface during regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on regeneration using CO2 or O2 alone, nor does it discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that high temperatures are involved due to the mention of exothermic reactions and high local temperatures during the regeneration process.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对本文讨论的VOx催化剂，是焦炭的形成。这一点通过拉曼光谱对使用过的催化剂表面碳质沉积物的观察得到了证实。

关于再生方法，文献主要讨论了使用空气进行再氧化。这种方法似乎在去除焦炭和重新氧化还原的钒物种方面是有效的，这从再氧化步骤中CO2和CO的形成可以看出。再生过程在前8-10分钟最为活跃，并在15分钟后基本完成。

然而，再生过程可能并不完全有效或可能存在一些缺点。文献提到了还原的钒物种可能未完全再氧化以及焦炭未完全去除的可能性。此外，由于氧化处理的高度放热性质和再生过程中催化剂表面产生的高局部温度，V氧化物结构可能会发生重排。

文献没有提供使用单独CO2或O2进行再生的具体信息，也没有讨论CO2添加在减缓VOx催化反应过度氧化方面的潜力。再生所需的温度要求没有明确说明，但从提到的放热反应和再生过程中的高局部温度可以推断，再生过程涉及高温。

[1] "With V5Si and V10Si, the formation of hydrogen remained constant after 10 min TOS, with V28Si and especially with V50Si, the formation of H2 reached a maximum at ca. 15 min TOS. This was clearly due to coke accumulation."

[2] "The hypothesis of coke accumulation on the catalyst during anaerobic operation is supported by various experimental evidence, including (i) the low final activity of V28Si and V50Si, in line with FT-IR data on NH3 and CO adsorption (vide supra); (ii) the experimental trend for H2 formation (vide infra); and (iii) the selectivity to propylene (close to 75%) after prolonged exposure to the hydrocarbon feed, which was lower than that (9095%) obtained with V10Si (although comparable with that of V5Si)."

[3] "Furthermore, during the half-cycle reoxidation step for the reduced catalyst, the formation of CO2, along with minor amounts of CO, was observed. The formation of these compounds was greatest during the first 810 min of treatment and became practically nil after approximately 15 min."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, is coke accumulation. This is evidenced by the decrease in hydrogen formation and lower propylene selectivity after prolonged exposure to hydrocarbon feed.

Regarding regeneration methods, reoxidation with air is discussed in the literature. This method is effective in removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The reoxidation process is most intense during the first 8-10 minutes, with CO2 and minor amounts of CO being formed. After about 15 minutes, the formation of these compounds becomes negligible, indicating that the regeneration process is complete.

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or the comparative effectiveness of different oxidizing agents like CO2 or O2. It also does not discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The effectiveness of the regeneration process is demonstrated by the restoration of catalyst activity, though it's noted that after regeneration, the activity may be slightly lower than the initial activity. This could be due to incomplete reoxidation, incomplete coke removal, or some rearrangement of the V oxide structure during the highly exothermal oxidation treatment.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对VOx催化剂，是积碳。这一点从氢气形成的减少和长时间暴露于碳氢化合物原料后丙烯选择性的降低可以得到证实。

关于再生方法，文献中讨论了使用空气再氧化的方法。这种方法在去除积碳和恢复催化剂活性方面是有效的。再氧化过程在前8-10分钟最为强烈，会形成CO2和少量CO。约15分钟后，这些化合物的形成变得可以忽略不计，表明再生过程已经完成。

文献没有提供关于再生所需温度的具体信息，也没有比较不同氧化剂如CO2或O2的有效性。同时也没有讨论在VOx催化反应中添加CO2以减少过度氧化的可能性。

再生过程的有效性通过催化剂活性的恢复得到证实，但值得注意的是，再生后的活性可能略低于初始活性。这可能是由于不完全再氧化、不完全积碳去除，或在高度放热的氧化处理过程中V氧化物结构发生了某些重排。

[1] "The catalysts described so far are usually prepared by impregnation, leading to deposition of vanadium onto the surface of the selected support."

[2] "The catalytic activity of all samples was compared both by co-feeding propane and oxygen (co-feeding mode) and under anaerobic conditions corresponding to the first step of the cyclic redox-decoupling mode, in which the feed of the hydrocarbon is alternated with that of oxygen."

[3] "The initial conversion was close to 14%, but declined rapidly with increasing TOS. Finally, the catalyst attained a steady state, with 6% conversion, due to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[4] "This effect can be attributed to incomplete reoxidation of the reduced vanadium species, to incomplete removal of coke, or again to some rearrangement of the V oxide structure as a consequence of the highly exothermal oxidation treatment and the high local temperature developing on the catalyst surface during this treatment."

[5] "The hypothesis of coke accumulation on the catalyst during anaerobic operation is supported by various experimental evidence"

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Reduction of the active metal species: The catalysts become progressively reduced during reaction, leading to a decline in activity.

2. Coke formation: Carbon deposits accumulate on the catalyst surface, blocking active sites.

3. Structural rearrangement: High temperatures during reaction or regeneration can cause changes in the oxide structure.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This is effective for restoring the oxidation state of the metal, but can lead to overoxidation and structural changes due to the exothermic nature of the process.

2. CO2 regeneration: While not explicitly mentioned for these catalysts, CO2 could potentially offer milder oxidation conditions, potentially reducing overoxidation issues.

3. Temperature requirements: Higher temperatures are generally needed for complete regeneration, but this risks further structural changes to the catalyst.

The effectiveness of regeneration varies:

1. Incomplete reoxidation can occur, especially if temperatures are too low.
2. Coke removal may be incomplete, leading to residual deactivation.
3. Structural changes during high-temperature regeneration can alter catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not directly addressed in this text. However, based on the information provided, using CO2 as a milder oxidant could potentially help balance the need for reoxidation with the risk of overoxidation and structural damage associated with more aggressive oxidants like O2.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 活性金属物种的还原：催化剂在反应过程中逐渐被还原，导致活性下降。

2. 焦炭形成：碳沉积物在催化剂表面累积，阻塞活性位点。

3. 结构重排：反应或再生过程中的高温可能导致氧化物结构发生变化。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：这种方法有效地恢复了金属的氧化状态，但由于过程的放热性，可能导致过度氧化和结构变化。

2. CO2再生：虽然文中没有明确提到这些催化剂的CO2再生，但CO2可能提供更温和的氧化条件，潜在地减少过度氧化问题。

3. 温度要求：完全再生通常需要较高的温度，但这会增加催化剂进一步结构变化的风险。

再生的效果各不相同：

1. 如果温度太低，可能会发生不完全再氧化。
2. 焦炭去除可能不完全，导致残余失活。
3. 高温再生过程中的结构变化可能改变催化性能。

文中没有直接讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。然而，根据提供的信息，使用CO2作为更温和的氧化剂可能有助于平衡再氧化的需求与更具侵略性的氧化剂（如O2）相关的过度氧化和结构损害风险。

The primary cause of deactivation for VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes appears to be coke accumulation, based on the evidence presented in the literature. 

Regarding regeneration methods, the study primarily discusses reoxidation with air. This method was shown to be effective in removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The reoxidation process was carried out at 550°C and resulted in the formation of CO2 and small amounts of CO, with most of the regeneration occurring within the first 8-10 minutes.

The effectiveness of the regeneration was demonstrated by the ability to run multiple reduction-oxidation cycles, though there was a slight decrease in activity after the first cycle. This could be due to incomplete reoxidation, incomplete coke removal, or some structural changes in the catalyst due to the high temperatures during oxidation.

The literature does not provide information on regeneration with CO2 or pure O2, nor does it discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, a comparison of these methods cannot be made based on the given information.

根据文献中提供的证据，VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因似乎是积碳。

关于再生方法，该研究主要讨论了用空气再氧化。这种方法被证明能有效去除积碳并恢复催化剂活性。再氧化过程在550°C下进行，产生CO2和少量CO，大部分再生在前8-10分钟内完成。

再生的有效性通过能够进行多次还原-氧化循环来证明，尽管第一次循环后活性略有下降。这可能是由于不完全再氧化、不完全积碳去除，或由于氧化过程中高温导致的催化剂结构变化。

文献没有提供关于用CO2或纯O2再生的信息，也没有讨论CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过度氧化的潜在影响。因此，基于给定信息无法对这些方法进行比较。

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding causes of deactivation and comparison of regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, based on the available information:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The main cause of deactivation mentioned is coke formation, particularly under anaerobic conditions. This is evidenced by Raman spectra of spent catalysts showing features associated with coke.

2. Regeneration methods: The document discusses reoxidation with air as a regeneration method. During this process, CO2 and small amounts of CO are formed, indicating the removal of coke deposits. However, the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance of different regeneration methods are not explicitly compared.

3. CO2 addition: The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not addressed in the given text.

4. Comparison of aerobic and anaerobic conditions: The study reports that FP-prepared samples showed high selectivity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions sometimes resulted in higher selectivity to propylene compared to co-feed (aerobic) conditions, especially for catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species.

5. Reoxidation mechanism: The text mentions that active oxidized VOx sites can be quickly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin, following a Mars van Krevelen mechanism involving V5+ reduction to V4+ and then to V3+.

The document does not provide comprehensive information on all aspects of the question, particularly regarding Cr-based catalysts and detailed comparisons of regeneration methods.
