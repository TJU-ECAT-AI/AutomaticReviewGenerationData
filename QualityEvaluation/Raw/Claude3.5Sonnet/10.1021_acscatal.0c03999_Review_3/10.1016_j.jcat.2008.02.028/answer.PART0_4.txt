[1] "Along with selectivity problems, the co-feeding of oxygen also can entail risks, which can be decreased through appropriate process engineering."

[2] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Mars van Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subsequent reoxidation [6,12]. Indeed, the first reaction step involves V5+, which reduces to V4+ and then to V3+. The active oxidized VOx sites can be promptly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin."

[3] "Catalytic activity measured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed a promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared samples."

[4] "Further evidence of the formation of coke under anaerobic conditions was provided by the Raman spectra of spent catalysts (i.e., analyzed after the reducing step). Typical Raman features associated with the presence of coke were observed (Fig. 13). Furthermore, during the half-cycle reoxidation step for the reduced catalyst, the formation of CO2, along with minor amounts of CO, was observed."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding causes of deactivation and comparison of regeneration methods for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, based on the available information:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The main cause of deactivation mentioned is coke formation, particularly under anaerobic conditions. This is evidenced by Raman spectra of spent catalysts showing features associated with coke.

2. Regeneration methods: The document discusses reoxidation with air as a regeneration method. During this process, CO2 and small amounts of CO are formed, indicating the removal of coke deposits. However, the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance of different regeneration methods are not explicitly compared.

3. CO2 addition: The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not addressed in the given text.

4. Comparison of aerobic and anaerobic conditions: The study reports that FP-prepared samples showed high selectivity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic conditions sometimes resulted in higher selectivity to propylene compared to co-feed (aerobic) conditions, especially for catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species.

5. Reoxidation mechanism: The text mentions that active oxidized VOx sites can be quickly restored by oxygen when co-fed with the paraffin, following a Mars van Krevelen mechanism involving V5+ reduction to V4+ and then to V3+.

The document does not provide comprehensive information on all aspects of the question, particularly regarding Cr-based catalysts and detailed comparisons of regeneration methods.

文献并未直接涉及氧化脱氢过程中Cr基和VOx催化剂失活原因以及再生方法比较的所有方面。然而，根据可获得的信息：

1. 催化剂失活：提到的主要失活原因是积碳形成，特别是在无氧条件下。这一点通过spent催化剂的拉曼光谱显示与积碳相关的特征得到证实。

2. 再生方法：文档讨论了使用空气再氧化作为一种再生方法。在此过程中，形成了CO2和少量CO，表明积碳沉积物被去除。然而，文中并未明确比较不同再生方法的有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响。

3. CO2添加：文本中没有提到在VOx催化反应中添加CO2以减少过度氧化的潜在作用。

4. 有氧和无氧条件的比较：研究报告称，FP制备的样品在有氧和无氧条件下都表现出高选择性。无氧条件有时会导致比共进料（有氧）条件更高的丙烯选择性，特别是对于具有高度分散VOx物种的催化剂。

5. 再氧化机理：文本提到，当与烷烃共进料时，活性氧化VOx位点可以通过氧气快速恢复，遵循Mars van Krevelen机理，涉及V5+还原为V4+然后再到V3+。

文档并未提供问题所有方面的全面信息，特别是关于Cr基催化剂和再生方法的详细比较。
