[1] "This indicates the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface."

[2] "Further evidence of the formation of coke under anaerobic conditions was provided by the Raman spectra of spent catalysts (i.e., analyzed after the reducing step). Typical Raman features associated with the presence of coke were observed (Fig. 13)."

[3] "Furthermore, during the half-cycle reoxidation step for the reduced catalyst, the formation of CO2, along with minor amounts of CO, was observed. The formation of these compounds was greatest during the first 810 min of treatment and became practically nil after approximately 15 min."

[4] "This effect can be attributed to incomplete reoxidation of the reduced vanadium species, to incomplete removal of coke, or again to some rearrangement of the V oxide structure as a consequence of the highly exothermal oxidation treatment and the high local temperature developing on the catalyst surface during this treatment."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts as discussed in this literature, is coke formation. This is evidenced by the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, as observed through Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts.

Regarding regeneration methods, the literature primarily discusses reoxidation with air. This method appears to be effective in removing coke and reoxidizing reduced vanadium species, as indicated by the formation of CO2 and CO during the reoxidation step. The regeneration process is most active in the first 8-10 minutes and is essentially complete after 15 minutes.

However, the regeneration process may not be fully effective or may have some drawbacks. The literature mentions potential incomplete reoxidation of reduced vanadium species and incomplete removal of coke. Additionally, there is a possibility of rearrangement of the V oxide structure due to the highly exothermic nature of the oxidation treatment and the high local temperatures that develop on the catalyst surface during regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on regeneration using CO2 or O2 alone, nor does it discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Temperature requirements for regeneration are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that high temperatures are involved due to the mention of exothermic reactions and high local temperatures during the regeneration process.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对本文讨论的VOx催化剂，是焦炭的形成。这一点通过拉曼光谱对使用过的催化剂表面碳质沉积物的观察得到了证实。

关于再生方法，文献主要讨论了使用空气进行再氧化。这种方法似乎在去除焦炭和重新氧化还原的钒物种方面是有效的，这从再氧化步骤中CO2和CO的形成可以看出。再生过程在前8-10分钟最为活跃，并在15分钟后基本完成。

然而，再生过程可能并不完全有效或可能存在一些缺点。文献提到了还原的钒物种可能未完全再氧化以及焦炭未完全去除的可能性。此外，由于氧化处理的高度放热性质和再生过程中催化剂表面产生的高局部温度，V氧化物结构可能会发生重排。

文献没有提供使用单独CO2或O2进行再生的具体信息，也没有讨论CO2添加在减缓VOx催化反应过度氧化方面的潜力。再生所需的温度要求没有明确说明，但从提到的放热反应和再生过程中的高局部温度可以推断，再生过程涉及高温。
