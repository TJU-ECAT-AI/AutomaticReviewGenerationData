[1] "The catalysts described so far are usually prepared by impregnation, leading to deposition of vanadium onto the surface of the selected support."

[2] "The catalytic activity of all samples was compared both by co-feeding propane and oxygen (co-feeding mode) and under anaerobic conditions corresponding to the first step of the cyclic redox-decoupling mode, in which the feed of the hydrocarbon is alternated with that of oxygen."

[3] "The initial conversion was close to 14%, but declined rapidly with increasing TOS. Finally, the catalyst attained a steady state, with 6% conversion, due to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[4] "This effect can be attributed to incomplete reoxidation of the reduced vanadium species, to incomplete removal of coke, or again to some rearrangement of the V oxide structure as a consequence of the highly exothermal oxidation treatment and the high local temperature developing on the catalyst surface during this treatment."

[5] "The hypothesis of coke accumulation on the catalyst during anaerobic operation is supported by various experimental evidence"

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include:

1. Reduction of the active metal species: The catalysts become progressively reduced during reaction, leading to a decline in activity.

2. Coke formation: Carbon deposits accumulate on the catalyst surface, blocking active sites.

3. Structural rearrangement: High temperatures during reaction or regeneration can cause changes in the oxide structure.

Regarding regeneration methods:

1. Reoxidation with air or O2: This is effective for restoring the oxidation state of the metal, but can lead to overoxidation and structural changes due to the exothermic nature of the process.

2. CO2 regeneration: While not explicitly mentioned for these catalysts, CO2 could potentially offer milder oxidation conditions, potentially reducing overoxidation issues.

3. Temperature requirements: Higher temperatures are generally needed for complete regeneration, but this risks further structural changes to the catalyst.

The effectiveness of regeneration varies:

1. Incomplete reoxidation can occur, especially if temperatures are too low.
2. Coke removal may be incomplete, leading to residual deactivation.
3. Structural changes during high-temperature regeneration can alter catalytic performance.

The potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not directly addressed in this text. However, based on the information provided, using CO2 as a milder oxidant could potentially help balance the need for reoxidation with the risk of overoxidation and structural damage associated with more aggressive oxidants like O2.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂（特别是基于Cr和VOx的催化剂）失活的主要原因包括：

1. 活性金属物种的还原：催化剂在反应过程中逐渐被还原，导致活性下降。

2. 焦炭形成：碳沉积物在催化剂表面累积，阻塞活性位点。

3. 结构重排：反应或再生过程中的高温可能导致氧化物结构发生变化。

关于再生方法：

1. 用空气或O2再氧化：这种方法有效地恢复了金属的氧化状态，但由于过程的放热性，可能导致过度氧化和结构变化。

2. CO2再生：虽然文中没有明确提到这些催化剂的CO2再生，但CO2可能提供更温和的氧化条件，潜在地减少过度氧化问题。

3. 温度要求：完全再生通常需要较高的温度，但这会增加催化剂进一步结构变化的风险。

再生的效果各不相同：

1. 如果温度太低，可能会发生不完全再氧化。
2. 焦炭去除可能不完全，导致残余失活。
3. 高温再生过程中的结构变化可能改变催化性能。

文中没有直接讨论CO2添加在VOx催化反应中减少过度氧化的潜力。然而，根据提供的信息，使用CO2作为更温和的氧化剂可能有助于平衡再氧化的需求与更具侵略性的氧化剂（如O2）相关的过度氧化和结构损害风险。
