[1] "With V5Si and V10Si, the formation of hydrogen remained constant after 10 min TOS, with V28Si and especially with V50Si, the formation of H2 reached a maximum at ca. 15 min TOS. This was clearly due to coke accumulation."

[2] "The hypothesis of coke accumulation on the catalyst during anaerobic operation is supported by various experimental evidence, including (i) the low final activity of V28Si and V50Si, in line with FT-IR data on NH3 and CO adsorption (vide supra); (ii) the experimental trend for H2 formation (vide infra); and (iii) the selectivity to propylene (close to 75%) after prolonged exposure to the hydrocarbon feed, which was lower than that (9095%) obtained with V10Si (although comparable with that of V5Si)."

[3] "Furthermore, during the half-cycle reoxidation step for the reduced catalyst, the formation of CO2, along with minor amounts of CO, was observed. The formation of these compounds was greatest during the first 810 min of treatment and became practically nil after approximately 15 min."

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on VOx catalysts, is coke accumulation. This is evidenced by the decrease in hydrogen formation and lower propylene selectivity after prolonged exposure to hydrocarbon feed.

Regarding regeneration methods, reoxidation with air is discussed in the literature. This method is effective in removing coke and restoring catalyst activity. The reoxidation process is most intense during the first 8-10 minutes, with CO2 and minor amounts of CO being formed. After about 15 minutes, the formation of these compounds becomes negligible, indicating that the regeneration process is complete.

The literature does not provide specific information on temperature requirements for regeneration or the comparative effectiveness of different oxidizing agents like CO2 or O2. It also does not discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The effectiveness of the regeneration process is demonstrated by the restoration of catalyst activity, though it's noted that after regeneration, the activity may be slightly lower than the initial activity. This could be due to incomplete reoxidation, incomplete coke removal, or some rearrangement of the V oxide structure during the highly exothermal oxidation treatment.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因，特别是针对VOx催化剂，是积碳。这一点从氢气形成的减少和长时间暴露于碳氢化合物原料后丙烯选择性的降低可以得到证实。

关于再生方法，文献中讨论了使用空气再氧化的方法。这种方法在去除积碳和恢复催化剂活性方面是有效的。再氧化过程在前8-10分钟最为强烈，会形成CO2和少量CO。约15分钟后，这些化合物的形成变得可以忽略不计，表明再生过程已经完成。

文献没有提供关于再生所需温度的具体信息，也没有比较不同氧化剂如CO2或O2的有效性。同时也没有讨论在VOx催化反应中添加CO2以减少过度氧化的可能性。

再生过程的有效性通过催化剂活性的恢复得到证实，但值得注意的是，再生后的活性可能略低于初始活性。这可能是由于不完全再氧化、不完全积碳去除，或在高度放热的氧化处理过程中V氧化物结构发生了某些重排。
