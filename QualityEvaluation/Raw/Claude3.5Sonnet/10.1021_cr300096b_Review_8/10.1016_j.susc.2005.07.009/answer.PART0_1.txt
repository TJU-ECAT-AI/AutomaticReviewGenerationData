[1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been attributed to the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and weakly p-bonded cyclohexene [6,10,11]. In addition, the adsorption of ethylene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has also been determined to occur by the weakly p-bonded configuration [11], which is different from the di-r chemisorption of ethylene on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

[3] "Using a similar argument, the observation of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that for Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni. This leads to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, as confirmed by TPD experiments.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach reveals that the weakly bonded adsorbates on ML Ni/Pt(111) surfaces result in low-temperature hydrogenation activity. This is observed for molecules like cyclohexene, ethylene, and 1-hexene, which adsorb in a weakly π-bonded configuration rather than the stronger di-σ chemisorption seen on pure Pt or Ni surfaces. 

This approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center shifts and resulting adsorbate binding energies for different Pt-3d combinations. Surfaces that induce moderate d-band shifts to allow weak but reactive adsorption would be predicted to have high hydrogenation activity. 

To design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, this integrated approach suggests focusing on bimetallic combinations and structures that optimize the balance between weak adsorption for high activity and sufficient binding for selectivity. Subsurface 3d metals that induce the right degree of electronic modification in surface Pt atoms would be promising candidates for enhanced hydrogenation catalysts.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C=C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与TPD等实验技术的观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明,对于Ni/Pt(111)表面,由于与亚表面Ni的相互作用,表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级。这导致氢和烯烃在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面的吸附较弱,这一点通过TPD实验得到了证实。

综合理论和实验方法揭示,ML Ni/Pt(111)表面弱结合的吸附物导致低温加氢活性。这种现象在环己烯、乙烯和1-己烯等分子上观察到,这些分子以弱π键合构型吸附,而不是在纯Pt或Ni表面上看到的更强的双σ化学吸附。

这种方法可以通过计算不同Pt-3d组合的d带中心位移和由此产生的吸附物结合能来预测加氢活性。能够诱导适度d带位移以允许弱但有反应性吸附的表面将被预测具有高加氢活性。

为了设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统,这种综合方法建议关注能够优化弱吸附(高活性)和足够结合(选择性)之间平衡的双金属组合和结构。能够在表面Pt原子中引起适当程度电子修饰的亚表面3d金属将是有前景的增强加氢催化剂候选者。
