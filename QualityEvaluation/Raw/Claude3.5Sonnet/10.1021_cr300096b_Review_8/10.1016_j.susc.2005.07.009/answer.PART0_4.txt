[1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "Using cyclohexene as a probe molecule on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface [911], we observed a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway to produce cyclohexane that was not present on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) [13,14] under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions."

[3] "The coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways."

[4] "The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been attributed to the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and weakly π-bonded cyclohexene [6,10,11]."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental TPD observations. The calculations show that for Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, subsurface Ni shifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms away from the Fermi level, weakening the adsorption of hydrogen and olefins. This correlates with experimental observations of low-temperature hydrogenation pathways for molecules like cyclohexene on ML Ni/Pt(111) that are not seen on pure Pt or Ni surfaces.

This integrated theoretical-experimental approach can predict hydrogenation activity by relating calculated d-band shifts and binding energies to the presence of weakly adsorbed reactants that enable low-temperature pathways. It informs catalyst design by identifying optimal surface compositions (like ML Ni/Pt) that balance weak but reactive adsorption. The approach could be extended to other Pt-3d combinations and hydrocarbon structures to rationally tune catalytic properties.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和含C=C键分子的吸附结合能与实验TPD观察结果有很好的相关性。计算表明,对于Ni/Pt(111)表面,亚表面Ni使表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级,减弱了氢和烯烃的吸附。这与实验观察到的在ML Ni/Pt(111)上环己烯等分子的低温加氢途径相关,而这些途径在纯Pt或Ni表面上是看不到的。

这种综合理论-实验方法可以通过将计算的d带偏移和结合能与弱吸附反应物的存在联系起来,预测加氢活性,从而实现低温反应途径。它通过识别平衡弱但反应性吸附的最佳表面组成(如ML Ni/Pt)来指导催化剂设计。这种方法可以扩展到其他Pt-3d组合和碳氢化合物结构,以合理地调整催化性能。
