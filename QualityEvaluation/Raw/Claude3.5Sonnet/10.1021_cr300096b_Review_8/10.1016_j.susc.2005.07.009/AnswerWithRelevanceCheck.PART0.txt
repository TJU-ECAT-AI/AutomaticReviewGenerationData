          [1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

          [2] "The coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways."

          [3] "The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been attributed to the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and weakly p-bonded cyclohexene [6,10,11]. In addition, the adsorption of ethylene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has also been determined to occur by the weakly p-bonded configuration [11], which is different from the di-r chemisorption of ethylene on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

          [4] "Using a similar argument, the observation of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane."

          [5] "The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The main difference is the much higher dehydrogenation activity in cyclohexene to produce benzene."

          [6] "The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity. The self-hydrogenation is nearly absent for 1-butene on ML Ni/Pt(111), most likely due to the relatively low desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed 1-butene."

          The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that for Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni. This leads to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, resulting in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways observed experimentally.

          The integrated theoretical and experimental approach reveals that:
          1. Molecules like cyclohexene, ethylene, and 1-hexene adsorb in a weakly π-bonded configuration on ML Ni/Pt(111), facilitating low-temperature hydrogenation.
          2. Cyclic hydrocarbons (e.g., cyclohexene) show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to linear alkenes (e.g., 1-hexene).
          3. Chain length affects self-hydrogenation activity, with longer chains (C6) exhibiting this behavior while shorter chains (C4) do not, likely due to differences in desorption temperatures.

          This approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:
          1. Calculating d-band center shifts and resulting adsorbate binding energies for different Pt-3d combinations.
          2. Optimizing the subsurface 3d metal content to tune the d-band center shift and adsorption strengths.
          3. Tailoring surface composition to balance hydrogenation vs dehydrogenation activity for specific target molecules.
          4. Considering the effects of molecular structure and chain length when designing catalysts for specific reactions or feedstocks.

          By combining theoretical predictions with experimental validation, researchers can more efficiently screen and develop Pt-3d catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for various hydrogenation reactions involving linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics.

          Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD等技术的实验观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明，对于Ni/Pt(111)表面，由于与亚表面Ni的相互作用，表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级。这导致氢和烯烃在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面的吸附较弱，实验中观察到低温氢化途径。

          综合理论和实验方法揭示：
          1. 环己烯、乙烯和1-己烯等分子在ML Ni/Pt(111)上以弱π键合构型吸附，促进低温氢化。
          2. 环状烃（如环己烯）比直链烯烃（如1-己烯）表现出更高的脱氢活性。
          3. 链长影响自氢化活性，长链（C6）表现出这种行为，而短链（C4）则没有，这可能是由于脱附温度的差异。

          这种方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统：
          1. 计算不同Pt-3d组合的d带中心位移和由此产生的吸附物结合能。
          2. 优化亚表面3d金属含量，以调节d带中心移位和吸附强度。
          3. 调整表面组成，平衡特定目标分子的氢化vs脱氢活性。
          4. 在设计特定反应或原料的催化剂时，考虑分子结构和链长的影响。

          通过将理论预测与实验验证相结合，研究人员可以更有效地筛选和开发具有改进活性和选择性的Pt-3d催化剂，用于涉及直链烯烃、环状烃和芳香烃的各种氢化反应。
