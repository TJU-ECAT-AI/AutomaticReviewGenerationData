[1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways."

[3] "Using a similar argument, the observation of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane."

[4] "The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The main difference is the much higher dehydrogenation activity in cyclohexene to produce benzene."

[5] "The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity. The self-hydrogenation is nearly absent for 1-butene on ML Ni/Pt(111), most likely due to the relatively low desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed 1-butene."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni atoms, leading to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. This correlates with experimental observations of low-temperature hydrogenation pathways due to the coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefins.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by considering factors such as:

1. Adsorption configuration: Molecules like 1-hexene, cyclohexene, and ethylene are likely adsorbed in a weak π-bonded configuration, facilitating low-temperature hydrogenation.

2. Molecular structure: Cyclic hydrocarbons like cyclohexene show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to linear alkenes like 1-hexene.

3. Chain length: Longer chain molecules (C6) exhibit self-hydrogenation activity, while shorter chains (C4) do not, likely due to differences in desorption temperatures.

This integrated approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Optimizing the subsurface 3d metal content to tune the d-band center shift and adsorption strengths.
2. Tailoring surface composition to balance hydrogenation vs dehydrogenation activity for specific target molecules.
3. Considering the effects of molecular structure and chain length when designing catalysts for specific reactions or feedstocks.

By combining theoretical predictions with experimental validation, researchers can more efficiently screen and develop Pt-3d catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for various hydrogenation reactions.

Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等技术的实验观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明，由于与亚表面Ni原子的相互作用，表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级，导致氢和烯烃在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面的吸附能力减弱。这与实验观察到的由于氢和烯烃弱吸附共存而导致的低温氢化途径相吻合。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过考虑以下因素来预测氢化活性：

1. 吸附构型：1-己烯、环己烯和乙烯等分子可能以弱π键合构型吸附，促进低温氢化。

2. 分子结构：环己烯等环状烃比1-己烯等直链烯烃表现出更高的脱氢活性。

3. 链长：长链分子（C6）表现出自氢化活性，而短链分子（C4）则没有，这可能是由于脱附温度的差异。

这种集成方法可以通过以下方式指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计：

1. 优化亚表面3d金属含量，以调节d带中心移位和吸附强度。
2. 调整表面组成，平衡特定目标分子的氢化vs脱氢活性。
3. 在设计特定反应或原料的催化剂时，考虑分子结构和链长的影响。

通过将理论预测与实验验证相结合，研究人员可以更有效地筛选和开发具有改进活性和选择性的Pt-3d催化剂，用于各种氢化反应。
