[1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways."

[3] "The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been attributed to the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and weakly p-bonded cyclohexene [6,10,11]. In addition, the adsorption of ethylene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has also been determined to occur by the weakly p-bonded configuration [11], which is different from the di-r chemisorption of ethylene on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

[4] "Using a similar argument, the observation of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that at monolayer Ni coverage on Pt(111), the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level, leading to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins. This correlates with experimental observations of low-temperature hydrogenation pathways on these surfaces.

Specifically, the weak adsorption predicted by theory matches the experimental detection of weakly π-bonded configurations for molecules like cyclohexene, ethylene, and 1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111), in contrast to stronger di-σ bonding on pure Pt or Ni surfaces. The coexistence of weakly bound hydrogen and olefins enables low-temperature hydrogenation, as seen in TPD experiments.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Using DFT to calculate d-band shifts and binding energies for different Pt-3d compositions and adsorbates
2. Correlating these with experimental TPD and spectroscopic data on adsorption configurations and reaction temperatures
3. Identifying surface compositions that optimize the balance of weak but reactive adsorbate binding

This allows rational design of Pt-3d catalysts by tuning the surface electronic structure to achieve desired adsorption strengths and reaction pathways for specific hydrogenation reactions. The approach could be extended to other molecule types and reaction classes to develop more efficient and selective catalytic systems.

Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD等技术的实验观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明,在Pt(111)上的单层Ni覆盖下,表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级,导致氢和烯烃的吸附较弱。这与这些表面上观察到的低温加氢途径的实验结果相符合。

具体来说,理论预测的弱吸附与实验检测到的分子(如环己烯、乙烯和1-己烯)在ML Ni/Pt(111)上的弱π键合构型相匹配,这与纯Pt或Ni表面上的强二σ键合形成对比。弱结合的氢和烯烃的共存使低温加氢成为可能,这在TPD实验中得到了证实。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以通过以下方式用于预测加氢活性:

1. 使用DFT计算不同Pt-3d组成和吸附质的d带移动和结合能
2. 将这些与实验TPD和光谱数据中的吸附构型和反应温度相关联
3. 确定能够优化弱但有反应性的吸附质结合平衡的表面组成

这允许通过调整表面电子结构来理性设计Pt-3d催化剂,以实现特定加氢反应所需的吸附强度和反应途径。这种方法可以扩展到其他类型的分子和反应类别,以开发更高效和选择性的催化系统。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that for Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni. This leads to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, as confirmed by TPD experiments.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach reveals that the weakly bonded adsorbates on ML Ni/Pt(111) surfaces result in low-temperature hydrogenation activity. This is observed for molecules like cyclohexene, ethylene, and 1-hexene, which adsorb in a weakly π-bonded configuration rather than the stronger di-σ chemisorption seen on pure Pt or Ni surfaces. 

This approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center shifts and resulting adsorbate binding energies for different Pt-3d combinations. Surfaces that induce moderate d-band shifts to allow weak but reactive adsorption would be predicted to have high hydrogenation activity. 

To design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, this integrated approach suggests focusing on bimetallic combinations and structures that optimize the balance between weak adsorption for high activity and sufficient binding for selectivity. Subsurface 3d metals that induce the right degree of electronic modification in surface Pt atoms would be promising candidates for enhanced hydrogenation catalysts.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C=C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与TPD等实验技术的观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明,对于Ni/Pt(111)表面,由于与亚表面Ni的相互作用,表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级。这导致氢和烯烃在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面的吸附较弱,这一点通过TPD实验得到了证实。

综合理论和实验方法揭示,ML Ni/Pt(111)表面弱结合的吸附物导致低温加氢活性。这种现象在环己烯、乙烯和1-己烯等分子上观察到,这些分子以弱π键合构型吸附,而不是在纯Pt或Ni表面上看到的更强的双σ化学吸附。

这种方法可以通过计算不同Pt-3d组合的d带中心位移和由此产生的吸附物结合能来预测加氢活性。能够诱导适度d带位移以允许弱但有反应性吸附的表面将被预测具有高加氢活性。

为了设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统,这种综合方法建议关注能够优化弱吸附(高活性)和足够结合(选择性)之间平衡的双金属组合和结构。能够在表面Pt原子中引起适当程度电子修饰的亚表面3d金属将是有前景的增强加氢催化剂候选者。

The self-hydrogenation is nearly absent for 1-butene on ML Ni/Pt(111), most likely due to the relatively low desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed 1-butene."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni atoms, leading to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. This correlates with experimental observations of low-temperature hydrogenation pathways due to the coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefins.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by considering factors such as:

1. Adsorption configuration: Molecules like 1-hexene, cyclohexene, and ethylene are likely adsorbed in a weak π-bonded configuration, facilitating low-temperature hydrogenation.

2. Molecular structure: Cyclic hydrocarbons like cyclohexene show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to linear alkenes like 1-hexene.

3. Chain length: Longer chain molecules (C6) exhibit self-hydrogenation activity, while shorter chains (C4) do not, likely due to differences in desorption temperatures.

This integrated approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Optimizing the subsurface 3d metal content to tune the d-band center shift and adsorption strengths.
2. Tailoring surface composition to balance hydrogenation vs dehydrogenation activity for specific target molecules.
3. Considering the effects of molecular structure and chain length when designing catalysts for specific reactions or feedstocks.

By combining theoretical predictions with experimental validation, researchers can more efficiently screen and develop Pt-3d catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for various hydrogenation reactions.

Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等技术的实验观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明，由于与亚表面Ni原子的相互作用，表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级，导致氢和烯烃在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面的吸附能力减弱。这与实验观察到的由于氢和烯烃弱吸附共存而导致的低温氢化途径相吻合。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过考虑以下因素来预测氢化活性：

1. 吸附构型：1-己烯、环己烯和乙烯等分子可能以弱π键合构型吸附，促进低温氢化。

2. 分子结构：环己烯等环状烃比1-己烯等直链烯烃表现出更高的脱氢活性。

3. 链长：长链分子（C6）表现出自氢化活性，而短链分子（C4）则没有，这可能是由于脱附温度的差异。

这种集成方法可以通过以下方式指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计：

1. 优化亚表面3d金属含量，以调节d带中心移位和吸附强度。
2. 调整表面组成，平衡特定目标分子的氢化vs脱氢活性。
3. 在设计特定反应或原料的催化剂时，考虑分子结构和链长的影响。

通过将理论预测与实验验证相结合，研究人员可以更有效地筛选和开发具有改进活性和选择性的Pt-3d催化剂，用于各种氢化反应。

The theoretical calculations show that for Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni. This leads to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins, as observed experimentally through low-temperature hydrogenation pathways.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by understanding how the d-band center shift affects adsorption energies and bonding configurations of different molecules. For example, the weak π-bonding of linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics predicted by theory is confirmed by TPD observations of low-temperature hydrogenation for molecules like 1-hexene and cyclohexene.

This combined approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by providing insight into how modifying the electronic structure through subsurface alloying affects surface reactivity. Tuning the d-band center by varying the composition and structure of Pt-3d alloys could allow for optimizing the balance between reactant adsorption strength and product desorption to maximize hydrogenation activity for specific molecules of interest.
