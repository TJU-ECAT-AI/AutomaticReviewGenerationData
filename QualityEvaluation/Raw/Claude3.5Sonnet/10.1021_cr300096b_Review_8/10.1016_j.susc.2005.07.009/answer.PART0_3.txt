[1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways."

[3] "Using a similar argument, the observation of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that for Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni. This leads to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins, as observed experimentally through low-temperature hydrogenation pathways.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by understanding how the d-band center shift affects adsorption energies and bonding configurations of different molecules. For example, the weak π-bonding of linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics predicted by theory is confirmed by TPD observations of low-temperature hydrogenation for molecules like 1-hexene and cyclohexene.

This combined approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by providing insight into how modifying the electronic structure through subsurface alloying affects surface reactivity. Tuning the d-band center by varying the composition and structure of Pt-3d alloys could allow for optimizing the balance between reactant adsorption strength and product desorption to maximize hydrogenation activity for specific molecules of interest.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和含C=C键分子的吸附能与TPD测量的实验观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明，对于Ni/Pt(111)表面，由于与亚表面Ni的相互作用，表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级。这导致氢和烯烃的吸附较弱，在实验中通过低温氢化途径观察到。

通过理解d带中心移动如何影响不同分子的吸附能和键合构型，可以利用这种集成的理论和实验方法来预测氢化活性。例如，理论预测的线性烷烃、环烃和芳烃的弱π键合得到了TPD观察到的1-己烯和环己烯等分子低温氢化的证实。

这种综合方法可以通过提供亚表面合金化如何通过修改电子结构影响表面反应活性的见解，为设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统提供信息。通过改变Pt-3d合金的成分和结构来调节d带中心，可以优化反应物吸附强度和产物脱附之间的平衡，从而最大化特定目标分子的氢化活性。
