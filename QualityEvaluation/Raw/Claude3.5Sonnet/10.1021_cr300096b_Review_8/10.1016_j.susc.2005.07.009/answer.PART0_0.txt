[1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "The coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways."

[3] "The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been attributed to the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and weakly p-bonded cyclohexene [6,10,11]. In addition, the adsorption of ethylene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has also been determined to occur by the weakly p-bonded configuration [11], which is different from the di-r chemisorption of ethylene on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

[4] "Using a similar argument, the observation of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that at monolayer Ni coverage on Pt(111), the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level, leading to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins. This correlates with experimental observations of low-temperature hydrogenation pathways on these surfaces.

Specifically, the weak adsorption predicted by theory matches the experimental detection of weakly π-bonded configurations for molecules like cyclohexene, ethylene, and 1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111), in contrast to stronger di-σ bonding on pure Pt or Ni surfaces. The coexistence of weakly bound hydrogen and olefins enables low-temperature hydrogenation, as seen in TPD experiments.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Using DFT to calculate d-band shifts and binding energies for different Pt-3d compositions and adsorbates
2. Correlating these with experimental TPD and spectroscopic data on adsorption configurations and reaction temperatures
3. Identifying surface compositions that optimize the balance of weak but reactive adsorbate binding

This allows rational design of Pt-3d catalysts by tuning the surface electronic structure to achieve desired adsorption strengths and reaction pathways for specific hydrogenation reactions. The approach could be extended to other molecule types and reaction classes to develop more efficient and selective catalytic systems.

Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD等技术的实验观察结果有很好的相关性。理论计算表明,在Pt(111)上的单层Ni覆盖下,表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级,导致氢和烯烃的吸附较弱。这与这些表面上观察到的低温加氢途径的实验结果相符合。

具体来说,理论预测的弱吸附与实验检测到的分子(如环己烯、乙烯和1-己烯)在ML Ni/Pt(111)上的弱π键合构型相匹配,这与纯Pt或Ni表面上的强二σ键合形成对比。弱结合的氢和烯烃的共存使低温加氢成为可能,这在TPD实验中得到了证实。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以通过以下方式用于预测加氢活性:

1. 使用DFT计算不同Pt-3d组成和吸附质的d带移动和结合能
2. 将这些与实验TPD和光谱数据中的吸附构型和反应温度相关联
3. 确定能够优化弱但有反应性的吸附质结合平衡的表面组成

这允许通过调整表面电子结构来理性设计Pt-3d催化剂,以实现特定加氢反应所需的吸附强度和反应途径。这种方法可以扩展到其他类型的分子和反应类别,以开发更高效和选择性的催化系统。
