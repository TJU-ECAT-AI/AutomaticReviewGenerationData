[1] "The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111)."

[2] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane."

[4] "For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface PtM3dPt structures have d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies compared to Pt(111). This correlates with higher hydrogenation rates observed experimentally for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not universally applicable. The PtCu catalyst, despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, showed the lowest activity. This exception suggests that the simple correlation is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane.

For more complex reactions like partial hydrogenation, the integrated theoretical and experimental approach needs to be expanded. More detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers are required to accurately predict hydrogenation activities. This is particularly important for cases like the production of cyclohexene over PtCu.

To utilize this approach for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers should:

1. Conduct DFT calculations to determine surface d-band centers and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces.
2. Correlate these theoretical results with experimental data from techniques like TPD measurements.
3. For simple, complete hydrogenation reactions, use the binding energy trends to predict relative catalytic activities.
4. For partial hydrogenation or more complex reactions, perform additional calculations of reaction networks and activation barriers.
5. Validate predictions with experimental studies on catalytic performance.
6. Iterate the process, using insights gained to design and test new Pt-3d catalytic systems with targeted properties for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This integrated approach can help identify promising Pt-3d combinations for specific hydrogenation reactions, guiding the development of more efficient catalytic systems tailored to particular applications.

Pt-3d催化剂上C=C键含分子的表面d带中心和吸附能的DFT计算结果通常与完全氢化反应的实验观察结果良好相关。计算表明，亚表面PtM3dPt结构的d带中心远离费米能级，导致与Pt(111)相比结合能较弱。这与实验中观察到的PtNi和PtCo催化剂比单金属Pt具有更高的氢化速率相一致。

然而，结合能与氢化活性之间的相关性并不是普遍适用的。尽管PtCu催化剂对1,4-CHD的结合能相对较低，但它显示出最低的活性。这个例外表明，简单的相关性仅适用于相对简单的氢化反应，如1,4-CHD完全氢化为环己烷。

对于更复杂的反应，如部分氢化，需要扩展集成的理论和实验方法。需要进行更详细的计算，包括反应网络和活化能障，以准确预测氢化活性。这对于PtCu上环己烯生成等情况尤其重要。

为了利用这种方法预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，研究人员应该：

1. 进行DFT计算，确定不同Pt-3d表面上各种C=C键含分子的表面d带中心和结合能。
2. 将这些理论结果与TPD测量等技术的实验数据相关联。
3. 对于简单的完全氢化反应，使用结合能趋势预测相对催化活性。
4. 对于部分氢化或更复杂的反应，进行反应网络和活化能障的额外计算。
5. 通过催化性能的实验研究验证预测。
6. 迭代这个过程，利用获得的见解设计和测试具有针对特定氢化反应的目标性能的新型Pt-3d催化系统。

这种集成方法可以帮助识别特定氢化反应的有前景的Pt-3d组合，指导开发针对特定应用的更高效催化系统。
