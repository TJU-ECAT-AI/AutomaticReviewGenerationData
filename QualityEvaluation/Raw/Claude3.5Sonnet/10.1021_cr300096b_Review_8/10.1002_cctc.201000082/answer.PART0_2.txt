[1] "The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111)."

[2] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane."

[4] "For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface structures of PtNi and PtCo have surface d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies for molecules like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111). This correlates with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not always straightforward, particularly for partial hydrogenation reactions. The PtCu catalyst, despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, showed the lowest overall activity but high selectivity for partial hydrogenation to cyclohexene. This suggests that for more complex reactions, additional factors beyond binding energy must be considered.

To better predict hydrogenation activity and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach is necessary. This approach should include:

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band centers and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules.
2. Experimental techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements to validate theoretical predictions.
3. More detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers, especially for partial hydrogenation reactions.
4. Consideration of factors beyond simple binding energies, such as the electronic and geometric effects of bimetallic formations.

By combining these theoretical and experimental methods, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behavior of Pt-3d systems. This integrated approach can help identify promising catalyst compositions for specific reactions, predict selectivity in partial hydrogenation processes, and guide the design of more efficient and selective catalytic systems for various hydrogenation applications.

Pt-3d催化剂上C=C键含有分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算结果通常与完全氢化反应的实验观察结果良好相关。计算表明，PtNi和PtCo的亚表面结构的表面d带中心远离费米能级，导致像1,4-环己二烯（1,4-CHD）这样的分子的结合能比Pt(111)更弱。这与PtNi和PtCo催化剂比单金属Pt具有更高氢化速率的实验观察结果相符。

然而，结合能与氢化活性之间的相关性并不总是直接的，特别是对于部分氢化反应。PtCu催化剂尽管对1,4-CHD具有相对较低的结合能，但显示出最低的整体活性，但对环己烯的部分氢化具有高选择性。这表明，对于更复杂的反应，必须考虑结合能以外的其他因素。

为了更好地预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，需要一种整合理论和实验的方法。这种方法应包括：

1. 对各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和结合能进行DFT计算。
2. 使用温度程序降温（TPD）等实验技术来验证理论预测。
3. 对反应网络和活化能垒进行更详细的计算，特别是对于部分氢化反应。
4. 考虑简单结合能以外的因素，如双金属形成的电子和几何效应。

通过结合这些理论和实验方法，研究人员可以对Pt-3d系统的催化行为有更全面的理解。这种整合方法可以帮助识别特定反应的有前景的催化剂组成，预测部分氢化过程中的选择性，并指导设计更高效、更具选择性的催化系统，用于各种氢化应用。
