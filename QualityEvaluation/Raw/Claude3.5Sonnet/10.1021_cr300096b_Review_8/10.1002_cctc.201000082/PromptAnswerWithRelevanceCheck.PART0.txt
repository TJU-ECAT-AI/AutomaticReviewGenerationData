[1] "The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111)."

[2] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane."

[4] "For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface PtM3dPt structures have d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies compared to Pt(111). This correlates with higher hydrogenation rates observed experimentally for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not universally applicable. The PtCu catalyst, despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, showed the lowest activity. This exception suggests that the simple correlation is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane.

For more complex reactions like partial hydrogenation, the integrated theoretical and experimental approach needs to be expanded. More detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers are required to accurately predict hydrogenation activities. This is particularly important for cases like the production of cyclohexene over PtCu.

To utilize this approach for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers should:

1. Conduct DFT calculations to determine surface d-band centers and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces.
2. Correlate these theoretical results with experimental data from techniques like TPD measurements.
3. For simple, complete hydrogenation reactions, use the binding energy trends to predict relative catalytic activities.
4. For partial hydrogenation or more complex reactions, perform additional calculations of reaction networks and activation barriers.
5. Validate predictions with experimental studies on catalytic performance.
6. Iterate the process, using insights gained to design and test new Pt-3d catalytic systems with targeted properties for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This integrated approach can help identify promising Pt-3d combinations for specific hydrogenation reactions, guiding the development of more efficient catalytic systems tailored to particular applications.

Pt-3d催化剂上C=C键含分子的表面d带中心和吸附能的DFT计算结果通常与完全氢化反应的实验观察结果良好相关。计算表明，亚表面PtM3dPt结构的d带中心远离费米能级，导致与Pt(111)相比结合能较弱。这与实验中观察到的PtNi和PtCo催化剂比单金属Pt具有更高的氢化速率相一致。

然而，结合能与氢化活性之间的相关性并不是普遍适用的。尽管PtCu催化剂对1,4-CHD的结合能相对较低，但它显示出最低的活性。这个例外表明，简单的相关性仅适用于相对简单的氢化反应，如1,4-CHD完全氢化为环己烷。

对于更复杂的反应，如部分氢化，需要扩展集成的理论和实验方法。需要进行更详细的计算，包括反应网络和活化能障，以准确预测氢化活性。这对于PtCu上环己烯生成等情况尤其重要。

为了利用这种方法预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，研究人员应该：

1. 进行DFT计算，确定不同Pt-3d表面上各种C=C键含分子的表面d带中心和结合能。
2. 将这些理论结果与TPD测量等技术的实验数据相关联。
3. 对于简单的完全氢化反应，使用结合能趋势预测相对催化活性。
4. 对于部分氢化或更复杂的反应，进行反应网络和活化能障的额外计算。
5. 通过催化性能的实验研究验证预测。
6. 迭代这个过程，利用获得的见解设计和测试具有针对特定氢化反应的目标性能的新型Pt-3d催化系统。

这种集成方法可以帮助识别特定氢化反应的有前景的Pt-3d组合，指导开发针对特定应用的更高效催化系统。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface bimetallic structures like PtNiPt and PtCoPt have surface d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies for molecules like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111). This weaker binding correlates with higher hydrogenation rates observed experimentally for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not always straightforward, as demonstrated by the PtCu catalyst. Despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, PtCu showed the lowest hydrogenation activity. This suggests that the simple correlation is valid mainly for complete hydrogenation reactions, but may not hold for partial hydrogenation reactions.

To better predict hydrogenation activity and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach is necessary. This approach should include:

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band centers and binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules.
2. Experimental techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements to validate theoretical predictions.
3. More detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers, especially for partial hydrogenation reactions.
4. Consideration of factors beyond binding energies, such as surface composition and structure.

By combining these theoretical and experimental methods, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behavior of Pt-3d systems. This integrated approach can help identify promising bimetallic combinations for specific hydrogenation reactions, guide the design of catalysts with improved selectivity for partial hydrogenation products, and ultimately lead to the development of more efficient and tailored catalytic systems for various industrial applications.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂上C═C键含有分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能，通常与完全氢化反应的实验观察结果有良好的相关性。计算表明，像PtNiPt和PtCoPt这样的亚表面双金属结构的表面d带中心远离费米能级，导致1,4-环己二烯（1,4-CHD）等分子的结合能比Pt(111)更弱。这种较弱的结合与实验观察到的PtNi和PtCo催化剂比单金属Pt具有更高的氢化速率相关。

然而，结合能与氢化活性之间的相关性并不总是直接的，PtCu催化剂就是一个例子。尽管1,4-CHD的结合能相对较低，但PtCu显示出最低的氢化活性。这表明简单的相关性主要适用于完全氢化反应，但可能不适用于部分氢化反应。

为了更好地预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，需要一种综合的理论和实验方法。这种方法应包括：

3. 进行更详细的计算，包括反应网络和活化能垒，特别是对于部分氢化反应。
4. 考虑结合能以外的因素，如表面组成和结构。

通过结合这些理论和实验方法，研究人员可以对Pt-3d系统的催化行为有更全面的理解。这种综合方法可以帮助识别特定氢化反应的有前途的双金属组合，指导设计具有改进的部分氢化产物选择性的催化剂，并最终导致开发出更高效和定制的催化系统，用于各种工业应用。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface structures of PtNi and PtCo result in weaker binding energies of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111), which corresponds to higher experimental hydrogenation rates.

However, this correlation has limitations. The PtCu catalyst showed low activity despite low binding energy, indicating that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is only valid for simple, complete hydrogenation reactions. For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexene production over PtCu, more complex calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers are necessary to accurately predict hydrogenation activities.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential Pt-3d combinations for desired binding energy characteristics.
2. Conducting experimental verification of promising candidates identified by DFT.
3. Developing more sophisticated theoretical models that account for partial hydrogenation pathways and reaction networks.
4. Iteratively refining the theoretical models based on experimental results to improve predictive capabilities.
5. Applying the refined models to design novel Pt-3d catalysts with tailored activity and selectivity for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This approach allows for a more efficient and targeted catalyst design process, potentially leading to the development of highly active and selective Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation applications.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design in several ways:

1. It can help identify promising bimetallic combinations for complete hydrogenation reactions by predicting binding energies and d-band center shifts.

2. For more complex reactions like partial hydrogenations, it highlights the need for more detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers.

3. It can guide the design of catalysts with specific selectivities, as demonstrated by the unexpected behavior of PtCu for partial hydrogenation.

4. The approach can be extended to study other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes and aromatics, to develop a broader understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems.

To further improve this approach and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers should:

1. Combine DFT calculations with experimental techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to validate theoretical predictions of binding energies.

2. Develop more comprehensive models that account for factors beyond simple binding energies, especially for complex reaction pathways.

3. Investigate a wider range of Pt-3d combinations and surface structures to identify optimal catalysts for specific reactions.

4. Use machine learning approaches to analyze the growing body of theoretical and experimental data, potentially uncovering new trends and design principles for Pt-3d catalysts.

2. 对于更复杂的反应，如部分氢化，它强调了需要进行更详细的计算，包括反应网络和活化能障。

3. 它可以指导设计具有特定选择性的催化剂，正如PtCu在部分氢化中表现出的意外行为所示。

4. 这种方法可以扩展到研究其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃和芳香族化合物，以发展对Pt-3d催化体系中结构-活性关系的更广泛理解。

为了进一步改进这种方法并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系，研究人员应该：

1. 将DFT计算与实验技术（如程序升温脱附，TPD）相结合，以验证理论预测的结合能。

2. 开发更全面的模型，考虑简单结合能以外的因素，特别是对于复杂的反应路径。

3. 研究更广泛的Pt-3d组合和表面结构，以确定特定反应的最佳催化剂。

4. 使用机器学习方法分析不断增长的理论和实验数据，可能揭示Pt-3d催化剂的新趋势和设计原则。
