[1] "The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111)."

[2] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane."

[4] "For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface structures of PtNi and PtCo result in weaker binding energies of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111), which corresponds to higher experimental hydrogenation rates.

However, this correlation has limitations. The PtCu catalyst showed low activity despite low binding energy, indicating that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is only valid for simple, complete hydrogenation reactions. For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexene production over PtCu, more complex calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers are necessary to accurately predict hydrogenation activities.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential Pt-3d combinations for desired binding energy characteristics.
2. Conducting experimental verification of promising candidates identified by DFT.
3. Developing more sophisticated theoretical models that account for partial hydrogenation pathways and reaction networks.
4. Iteratively refining the theoretical models based on experimental results to improve predictive capabilities.
5. Applying the refined models to design novel Pt-3d catalysts with tailored activity and selectivity for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This approach allows for a more efficient and targeted catalyst design process, potentially leading to the development of highly active and selective Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation applications.

Pt-3d催化剂上C=C键含有分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算结果通常与完全氢化反应的实验观察结果有良好的相关性。计算表明，PtNi和PtCo的亚表面结构导致1,4-环己二烯（1,4-CHD）的结合能比Pt(111)弱，这与实验中观察到的更高的氢化速率相对应。

然而，这种相关性存在局限性。PtCu催化剂尽管结合能低，但活性却很低，这表明结合能与氢化活性之间的简单相关性仅适用于简单的完全氢化反应。对于部分氢化反应，如PtCu上环己烯的生成，需要进行涉及反应网络和活化能垒的更复杂计算，以准确预测氢化活性。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导更高效Pt-3d催化系统的设计，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算筛选潜在的Pt-3d组合，以获得所需的结合能特性。
2. 对DFT识别的有前景的候选材料进行实验验证。
3. 开发更复杂的理论模型，考虑部分氢化途径和反应网络。
4. 根据实验结果迭代优化理论模型，以提高预测能力。
5. 应用优化后的模型设计新型Pt-3d催化剂，使其对特定氢化反应具有定制的活性和选择性。

这种方法允许更高效和有针对性的催化剂设计过程，有可能开发出针对各种氢化应用的高活性和高选择性Pt-3d催化剂。
