[1] "The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111)."

[2] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane."

[4] "For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface structures of PtNi and PtCo have d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies for adsorbates like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111). This correlates with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not always straightforward, particularly for partial hydrogenation reactions. The PtCu catalyst, despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, showed the lowest overall activity but high selectivity for partial hydrogenation to cyclohexene.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design in several ways:

1. It can help identify promising bimetallic combinations for complete hydrogenation reactions by predicting binding energies and d-band center shifts.

2. For more complex reactions like partial hydrogenations, it highlights the need for more detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers.

3. It can guide the design of catalysts with specific selectivities, as demonstrated by the unexpected behavior of PtCu for partial hydrogenation.

4. The approach can be extended to study other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes and aromatics, to develop a broader understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems.

To further improve this approach and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers should:

1. Combine DFT calculations with experimental techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to validate theoretical predictions of binding energies.

2. Develop more comprehensive models that account for factors beyond simple binding energies, especially for complex reaction pathways.

3. Investigate a wider range of Pt-3d combinations and surface structures to identify optimal catalysts for specific reactions.

4. Use machine learning approaches to analyze the growing body of theoretical and experimental data, potentially uncovering new trends and design principles for Pt-3d catalysts.

DFT计算对Pt-3d催化剂上含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的计算结果通常与完全氢化反应的实验观察结果有良好的相关性。计算表明，PtNi和PtCo的亚表面结构的d带中心远离费米能级，导致吸附物（如1,4-环己二烯，1,4-CHD）的结合能比Pt(111)更弱。这与PtNi和PtCo催化剂比单金属Pt具有更高氢化速率的实验观察结果相符。

然而，结合能与氢化活性之间的相关性并不总是直接的，特别是对于部分氢化反应。PtCu催化剂尽管对1,4-CHD的结合能相对较低，但总体活性最低，但对环己烯的部分氢化选择性高。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导催化剂设计，主要有以下几种方式：

1. 通过预测结合能和d带中心偏移，可以帮助识别完全氢化反应的有前景的双金属组合。

2. 对于更复杂的反应，如部分氢化，它强调了需要进行更详细的计算，包括反应网络和活化能障。

3. 它可以指导设计具有特定选择性的催化剂，正如PtCu在部分氢化中表现出的意外行为所示。

4. 这种方法可以扩展到研究其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃和芳香族化合物，以发展对Pt-3d催化体系中结构-活性关系的更广泛理解。

为了进一步改进这种方法并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系，研究人员应该：

1. 将DFT计算与实验技术（如程序升温脱附，TPD）相结合，以验证理论预测的结合能。

2. 开发更全面的模型，考虑简单结合能以外的因素，特别是对于复杂的反应路径。

3. 研究更广泛的Pt-3d组合和表面结构，以确定特定反应的最佳催化剂。

4. 使用机器学习方法分析不断增长的理论和实验数据，可能揭示Pt-3d催化剂的新趋势和设计原则。
