[1] "The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111)."

[2] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane."

[4] "For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface bimetallic structures like PtNiPt and PtCoPt have surface d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies for molecules like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111). This weaker binding correlates with higher hydrogenation rates observed experimentally for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not always straightforward, as demonstrated by the PtCu catalyst. Despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, PtCu showed the lowest hydrogenation activity. This suggests that the simple correlation is valid mainly for complete hydrogenation reactions, but may not hold for partial hydrogenation reactions.

To better predict hydrogenation activity and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach is necessary. This approach should include:

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band centers and binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules.
2. Experimental techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements to validate theoretical predictions.
3. More detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers, especially for partial hydrogenation reactions.
4. Consideration of factors beyond binding energies, such as surface composition and structure.

By combining these theoretical and experimental methods, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behavior of Pt-3d systems. This integrated approach can help identify promising bimetallic combinations for specific hydrogenation reactions, guide the design of catalysts with improved selectivity for partial hydrogenation products, and ultimately lead to the development of more efficient and tailored catalytic systems for various industrial applications.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂上C═C键含有分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能，通常与完全氢化反应的实验观察结果有良好的相关性。计算表明，像PtNiPt和PtCoPt这样的亚表面双金属结构的表面d带中心远离费米能级，导致1,4-环己二烯（1,4-CHD）等分子的结合能比Pt(111)更弱。这种较弱的结合与实验观察到的PtNi和PtCo催化剂比单金属Pt具有更高的氢化速率相关。

然而，结合能与氢化活性之间的相关性并不总是直接的，PtCu催化剂就是一个例子。尽管1,4-CHD的结合能相对较低，但PtCu显示出最低的氢化活性。这表明简单的相关性主要适用于完全氢化反应，但可能不适用于部分氢化反应。

为了更好地预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，需要一种综合的理论和实验方法。这种方法应包括：

1. 对各种C═C键含有分子进行表面d带中心和结合能的DFT计算。
2. 使用温度程序化脱附（TPD）等实验技术来验证理论预测。
3. 进行更详细的计算，包括反应网络和活化能垒，特别是对于部分氢化反应。
4. 考虑结合能以外的因素，如表面组成和结构。

通过结合这些理论和实验方法，研究人员可以对Pt-3d系统的催化行为有更全面的理解。这种综合方法可以帮助识别特定氢化反应的有前途的双金属组合，指导设计具有改进的部分氢化产物选择性的催化剂，并最终导致开发出更高效和定制的催化系统，用于各种工业应用。
