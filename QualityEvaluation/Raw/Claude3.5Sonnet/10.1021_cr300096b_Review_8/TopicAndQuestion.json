    "QuestionEnglish": "How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?",
    "QuestionChinese": "对于不同含C═C键的分子（包括直链烯烃、环状烃和芳香族化合物）在Pt-3d催化剂上的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算结果如何与TPD等实验技术的观测结果相关联，这种理论与实验相结合的方法如何用于预测氢化活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化体系的设计？"
