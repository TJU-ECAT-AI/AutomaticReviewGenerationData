Correlating Benzene Hydrogenation Activity with Binding Energies of
Hydrogen and Benzene on Co-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
Shuliang Lu,[a] Carl A. Menning,[b] Yuexiang Zhu,*[a] and Jingguang G. Chen*[b]
The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane is of significant
importance in the petroleum industry and for environmental
protection. The process of benzene hydrogenation has been
utilized commercially for the production of cyclohexane, which
is one of the key intermediates in the synthesis of Nylon-6 and
Nylon-66.[1] Thermodynamic and kinetic studies have shown
that polyaromatics are easier to be reduced than benzene
under moderate reaction conditions.[2] Thus, discovery of active
catalysts for benzene hydrogenation should be useful for the
removal and utilization of both benzene and polyaromatics.
Ni-based catalysts have been studied[37] in the hydrogenation
of benzene and are already used in commercial processes. Al-
though supported cobalt catalysts have been widely used in
FischerTropsch synthesis, relatively few studies have been re-
ported concerning benzene hydrogenation over Co-based cat-
alysts.[813] In our previous work, PtCo and PtNi bimetallic and
the
corresponding
monometallic
catalysts
supported
on
g-Al2O3 were compared and the results suggested that Co-
based bimetallic catalysts possessed higher activity than Ni-
based catalysts for benzene hydrogenation at low tempera-
tures.[14]
Herein, we use Co-based catalysts to determine the effect of
bimetallic formation on the hydrogenation activity with com-
bined experimental and theoretical methods. The hydrogena-
tion of benzene is compared over silica-supported PtCo, PdCo,
RuCo bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts
using both flow and batch reactors. The hydrogenation activi-
ty, together with apparent activation barrier and rate con-
stants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding
energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all
indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should
follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPtCoRuPd. Be-
cause of the availability of the large database of binding ener-
gies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correla-
tion of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity
should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bi-
metallic catalysts based on DFT calculations.
The catalyst preparation and evaluation methods for the hy-
drogenation of benzene in flow and batch reactors are similar
to those described in detail previously.[14] From the H2-tempera-
ture-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles for the catalysts,
shown in Figure S1, the presence of Pt, Pd and Ru promoted
the reduction of the cobalt catalysts at lower temperatures,
most likely due to the spill-over of atomic hydrogen from Pt,
Pd and Ru. In order to measure the number of active sites on
the surface for the reduced catalysts, the volumetric static CO
chemisorption technique is used and the results are listed in
Table 1. The amount of CO adsorbed per gram catalyst repre-
sents the number of active sites on the surface of the catalysts.
The catalytic activity of benzene hydrogenation over these
catalysts in a flow reactor is compared in Figure 1. The activity
is normalized using the conversion divided by the active sites
on the catalysts according to the amount of CO adsorbed from
CO chemisorption. The conversion of benzene without such
normalization is shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Informa-
tion. The catalytic activities for the seven catalysts show the
following trend: PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPt>CoRuPd.
The apparent activation barriers for benzene hydrogenation
are estimated by performing catalytic studies at different tem-
peratures, as shown in the Arrhenius plots for several catalysts
in Figure S3. The values are compared in Table 1. The PtCo bi-
metallic catalyst exhibits the lowest activation barrier of
21.2 kJmol1, with the apparent activation barriers following
the trend of PtCo !PdCo<RuCoPt<Co, which is generally
consistent with the trend in catalytic activity in Figure 1.
The batch reactor study shows the same trend in catalytic
activity for the hydrogenation of benzene. The different cata-
lytic activities are illustrated in the rate of benzene consump-
tion (Figure 2) and the production of cyclohexane (Figure S4).
The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits much higher activity than
the other Co-based catalysts. The difference in rates is quanti-
fied by fitting a first-order rate equation to the consumption of
benzene. The value of the rate constant k is compared in
Table 1, which once again shows the same trend in hydrogena-
tion activity among the three bimetallic catalysts: PtCo>
PdCo>RuCo.
In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene,
the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the bind-
ing energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several
Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17] In order to determine whether
such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT
was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding en-
ergies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna
ab initio simulations package (VASP). The optimized configura-

How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
