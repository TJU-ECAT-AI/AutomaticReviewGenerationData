The literature does not directly address the correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts and experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, it does discuss the use of DFT calculations to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design.

The study demonstrates that DFT calculations of hydrogen and benzene binding energies on bimetallic surfaces can be correlated with experimental observations of hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants. This approach was used to predict the trend in benzene hydrogenation activity for different Co-based bimetallic catalysts.

The researchers suggest that the availability of a large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces provides opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on these calculations. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.

The study also mentions previous work correlating hydrogenation activity with binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on Pt-based bimetallic systems, indicating that this approach can be applied to various C=C bond-containing molecules, including cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatics.

While the literature does not specifically mention TPD measurements or surface d-band center calculations, it demonstrates the potential of combining DFT calculations with experimental observations to predict and optimize catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions.
