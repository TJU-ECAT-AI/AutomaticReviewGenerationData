[1] "The hydrogenation activity, together with apparent activation barrier and rate constants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPtCoRuPd."

[2] "Because of the availability of the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correlation of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations."

[3] "In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17]"

[4] "In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP)."

The literature does not directly address the specific correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts and experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, it does discuss the use of DFT calculations to correlate binding energies with hydrogenation activity for benzene and cyclohexene on Co-based and Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

The study demonstrates that DFT-calculated hydrogen and benzene binding energies correlate well with experimental observations of benzene hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants for various Co-based bimetallic catalysts. This correlation allows for the prediction of catalytic activity trends among different bimetallic systems.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach described in the literature can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Calculating binding energies for hydrogen and target molecules (e.g., benzene, cyclohexene) on various bimetallic surfaces using DFT.
2. Correlating these calculated binding energies with experimental hydrogenation activity data.
3. Using the established correlations to predict the hydrogenation activity of new bimetallic catalyst combinations.
4. Leveraging the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces to guide the selection and design of more efficient catalysts.

While the study focuses on benzene hydrogenation, the approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, to develop a more comprehensive understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与TPD等实验观测技术之间的具体相关性。然而，它确实讨论了使用DFT计算来关联Co基和Pt基双金属催化剂上苯和环己烯的结合能与加氢活性。

研究表明，DFT计算的氢和苯的结合能与各种Co基双金属催化剂的苯加氢活性、表观活化能和反应速率常数的实验观测结果具有良好的相关性。这种相关性允许预测不同双金属体系之间的催化活性趋势。

文献中描述的理论和实验方法相结合的方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化体系的设计，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算各种双金属表面上氢和目标分子（如苯、环己烯）的结合能。
2. 将这些计算得到的结合能与实验加氢活性数据相关联。
3. 利用建立的相关性来预测新的双金属催化剂组合的加氢活性。
4. 利用双金属表面DFT计算结合能的大型数据库来指导更高效催化剂的选择和设计。

虽然该研究主要关注苯的加氢，但这种方法可能会扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香族化合物，以发展对Pt-3d催化体系中结构-活性关系的更全面理解。
