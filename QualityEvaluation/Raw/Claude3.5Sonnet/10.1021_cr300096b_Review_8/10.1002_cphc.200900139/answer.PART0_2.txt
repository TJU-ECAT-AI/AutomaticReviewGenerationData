[1] "The hydrogenation activity, together with apparent activation barrier and rate constants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPtCoRuPd."

[2] "Because of the availability of the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correlation of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations."

[3] "In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17]"

[4] "In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP)."

The literature does not directly address the correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, it does discuss the use of DFT calculations to correlate binding energies with hydrogenation activity for benzene and cyclohexene on Co-based and Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

The study demonstrates that DFT calculations of hydrogen and benzene binding energies on bimetallic surfaces can be correlated with experimental measurements of hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows researchers to predict hydrogenation activity trends across different bimetallic catalysts.

The literature suggests that this method can be extended to other systems, potentially including various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. By establishing correlations between calculated binding energies and experimental hydrogenation activity, researchers can use DFT calculations to predict and select bimetallic catalysts with improved efficiency for specific hydrogenation reactions.

While the study focuses on benzene hydrogenation, the approach could be applied to linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and other aromatics. By combining DFT calculations with experimental techniques like TPD measurements, researchers could develop a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between surface properties, adsorbate interactions, and catalytic performance for a wide range of Pt-3d catalytic systems.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与TPD等实验技术观察结果之间的相关性。然而，它确实讨论了使用DFT计算来关联Co基和Pt基双金属催化剂上苯和环己烯的结合能与加氢活性。

研究表明，双金属表面上氢和苯的结合能的DFT计算可以与加氢活性、表观活化能和反应速率常数的实验测量结果相关联。这种集成的理论和实验方法使研究人员能够预测不同双金属催化剂的加氢活性趋势。

文献表明，这种方法可以扩展到其他系统，可能包括Pt-3d催化剂上的各种含C=C键分子。通过建立计算的结合能与实验加氢活性之间的相关性，研究人员可以使用DFT计算来预测和选择具有改进效率的双金属催化剂，用于特定的加氢反应。

虽然该研究侧重于苯的加氢，但这种方法可以应用于直链烯烃、环状烃和其他芳香族化合物。通过将DFT计算与TPD测量等实验技术相结合，研究人员可以对广泛的Pt-3d催化系统的表面性质、吸附物相互作用和催化性能之间的关系建立更全面的理解。
