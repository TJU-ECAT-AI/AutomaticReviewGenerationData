[1] "The hydrogenation activity, together with apparent activation barrier and rate constants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPtCoRuPd."

[2] "Because of the availability of the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correlation of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations."

[3] "In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17]"

[4] "In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP)."

The literature does not directly address the correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, it does discuss the use of DFT calculations to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design.

The study shows that DFT calculations of hydrogen and benzene binding energies on bimetallic surfaces were correlated with experimental hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants for benzene hydrogenation. This integrated approach of combining theoretical calculations with experimental results allowed researchers to predict the trend in benzene hydrogenation activity among different Co-based bimetallic catalysts.

The authors suggest that this correlation between DFT-calculated binding energies and experimental hydrogenation activity can be used to predict and select bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation. They also mention a previous study where a similar approach was used for cyclohexene hydrogenation on Pt-based bimetallic systems.

While the study focuses on benzene hydrogenation, the approach of correlating DFT-calculated binding energies with experimental activity could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes and cyclic hydrocarbons. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach shows promise for predicting hydrogenation activity and guiding the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for various hydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献没有直接讨论Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果的相关性。然而，它确实讨论了使用DFT计算来预测加氢活性和指导催化剂设计。

研究表明，双金属表面上氢和苯的结合能的DFT计算与实验观察到的苯加氢活性、表观活化能和反应速率常数相关。这种将理论计算与实验结果相结合的综合方法使研究人员能够预测不同Co基双金属催化剂的苯加氢活性趋势。

作者认为，这种DFT计算的结合能与实验加氢活性之间的相关性可以用来预测和选择苯加氢的双金属催化剂。他们还提到了一项先前的研究，其中类似的方法被用于Pt基双金属系统上的环己烯加氢。

虽然这项研究集中在苯的加氢上，但将DFT计算的结合能与实验活性相关联的方法可能会扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃和环状烃。这种综合理论和实验的方法显示出预测加氢活性和指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统设计的潜力，可用于各种加氢反应。
