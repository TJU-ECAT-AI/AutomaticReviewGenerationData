[1] "The hydrogenation activity, together with apparent activation barrier and rate constants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPtCoRuPd."

[2] "Because of the availability of the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correlation of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations."

[3] "In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17]"

[4] "In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP)."

The literature does not directly address the correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, it does discuss the use of DFT calculations to correlate binding energies with hydrogenation activity for benzene and cyclohexene on bimetallic catalysts.

The study demonstrates that DFT calculations of hydrogen and benzene binding energies on bimetallic surfaces can be correlated with experimental hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants. This approach allows for the prediction of catalytic activity trends among different bimetallic catalysts.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Calculating binding energies of hydrogen and the target molecule (e.g., benzene) on various bimetallic surfaces using DFT.
2. Correlating these calculated binding energies with experimental data on hydrogenation activity, activation barriers, and rate constants.
3. Using the established correlations to predict the activity of other bimetallic catalysts based on their calculated binding energies.

This method can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Screening a large number of potential bimetallic catalysts using DFT calculations.
2. Identifying promising candidates with optimal binding energies for the target reaction.
3. Guiding experimental efforts towards the most promising bimetallic compositions, potentially reducing the time and resources required for catalyst development.

While the study focuses on benzene hydrogenation, the approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, to develop more efficient catalytic systems for various hydrogenation reactions.

文献并没有直接讨论Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD等实验技术观察结果之间的相关性。然而，它确实讨论了使用DFT计算来关联双金属催化剂上苯和环己烯的结合能与加氢活性。

研究表明，双金属表面上氢和苯的结合能的DFT计算可以与实验观察到的加氢活性、表观活化能和反应速率常数相关联。这种方法允许预测不同双金属催化剂之间的催化活性趋势。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以用来预测加氢活性，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算各种双金属表面上氢和目标分子（如苯）的结合能。
2. 将这些计算得到的结合能与加氢活性、活化能和反应速率常数的实验数据相关联。
3. 利用建立的相关性，根据其他双金属催化剂的计算结合能来预测它们的活性。

这种方法可以通过以下方式指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计：

1. 使用DFT计算筛选大量潜在的双金属催化剂。
2. 识别出对目标反应具有最佳结合能的有前景的候选催化剂。
3. 引导实验努力朝着最有前景的双金属组成方向发展，可能减少催化剂开发所需的时间和资源。

虽然这项研究主要关注苯的加氢，但这种方法可能可以扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香烃，以开发各种加氢反应的更高效的催化系统。
