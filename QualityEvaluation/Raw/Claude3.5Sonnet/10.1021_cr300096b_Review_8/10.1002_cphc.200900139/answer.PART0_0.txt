[1] "The hydrogenation activity, together with apparent activation barrier and rate constants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPtCoRuPd."

[2] "Because of the availability of the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correlation of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations."

[3] "In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17]"

[4] "In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP)."

The literature does not directly address the correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts and experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, it does discuss the use of DFT calculations to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design.

The study demonstrates that DFT calculations of hydrogen and benzene binding energies on bimetallic surfaces can be correlated with experimental observations of hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants. This approach was used to predict the trend in benzene hydrogenation activity for different Co-based bimetallic catalysts.

The researchers suggest that the availability of a large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces provides opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on these calculations. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.

The study also mentions previous work correlating hydrogenation activity with binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on Pt-based bimetallic systems, indicating that this approach can be applied to various C=C bond-containing molecules, including cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatics.

While the literature does not specifically mention TPD measurements or surface d-band center calculations, it demonstrates the potential of combining DFT calculations with experimental observations to predict and optimize catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与TPD等实验技术观察结果之间的相关性。然而，它确实讨论了使用DFT计算来预测氢化活性和指导催化剂设计。

研究表明，双金属表面上氢和苯的结合能的DFT计算可以与氢化活性、表观活化能和反应速率常数的实验观察结果相关联。这种方法被用来预测不同钴基双金属催化剂的苯氢化活性趋势。

研究人员指出，从双金属表面DFT计算得到的大量结合能数据库为基于这些计算预测和选择双金属催化剂提供了机会。这种集理论和实验为一体的方法可用于指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计，以用于氢化反应。

研究还提到了之前的工作，即将氢化活性与Pt基双金属系统上原子氢和环己烯的结合能相关联，表明这种方法可以应用于各种含C=C键的分子，包括环状烃和芳香烃。

虽然文献没有特别提到TPD测量或表面d带中心计算，但它展示了将DFT计算与实验观察相结合来预测和优化氢化反应中催化性能的潜力。
