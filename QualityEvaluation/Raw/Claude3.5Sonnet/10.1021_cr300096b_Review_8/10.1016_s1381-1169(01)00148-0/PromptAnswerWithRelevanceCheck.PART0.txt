How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it discuss TPD measurements or correlations between theoretical and experimental approaches for these systems. The document focuses on palladium-based bimetallic catalysts and does not cover the specific Pt-3d catalytic systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
