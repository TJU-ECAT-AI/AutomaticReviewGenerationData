A comprehensive analysis of Pt-3d catalysts for C═C bond hydrogenation offers valuable insights into the design and performance prediction of these catalysts. This multifaceted approach combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations, experimental validation, and structure-activity relationships to provide a holistic understanding of the catalytic process. DFT calculations allow researchers to explore the electronic structure and adsorption properties of various Pt-3d catalyst compositions at the atomic level. Experimental validation through techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in-situ reaction studies corroborate the theoretical findings and provide real-world performance data. By integrating these results, researchers can establish structure-activity relationships that link catalyst composition and structure to hydrogenation efficiency. This integrated approach enables the rational design of optimized Pt-3d catalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability for C═C bond hydrogenation. Furthermore, the developed models and correlations can be used to predict the performance of novel catalyst compositions, accelerating the discovery of improved materials for industrial applications in fields such as fine chemical synthesis and petrochemical processing.
