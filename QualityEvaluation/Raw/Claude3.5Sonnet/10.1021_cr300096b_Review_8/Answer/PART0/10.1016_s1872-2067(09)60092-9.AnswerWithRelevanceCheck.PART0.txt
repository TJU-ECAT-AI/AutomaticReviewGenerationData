          [1] "We correlated the experimental results with density functional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

[2] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[3] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."

          The study demonstrates a correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies and experimental observations of hydrogenation activity for Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, specifically for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD). The research shows that surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

DFT calculations were used to predict binding energies of 1,3-CHD on various surfaces, including Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. These theoretical results were then correlated with experimental hydrogenation rates observed in a batch reactor.

The Pt-Ni-Pt(111) subsurface structure, which has lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to monometallic surfaces, showed higher hydrogenation activity experimentally. This correlation between weaker binding and higher activity is consistent with previous studies on cycloalkene hydrogenation.

While the study focuses on 1,3-CHD, it suggests that this integrated theoretical and experimental approach could be extended to predict hydrogenation activity for other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies for these molecules on various Pt-3d catalyst surfaces, researchers could potentially predict their hydrogenation activity and use this information to design more efficient catalytic systems.

However, the study does not explicitly mention surface d-band center calculations or TPD measurements. To fully address the question, additional research would be needed to incorporate these specific aspects into the integrated theoretical and experimental approach for a wider range of C=C bond-containing molecules and Pt-3d catalysts.

          该研究展示了Pt-Ni双金属催化剂的DFT结合能计算与实验观察到的氢化活性之间的相关性，特别是对于1,3-环己二烯（1,3-CHD）。研究表明，具有较弱环烯烃结合能的表面通常表现出更高的氢化活性。

研究使用DFT计算来预测1,3-CHD在各种表面上的结合能，包括Pt(111)、Ni(111)和Pt-Ni双金属结构。然后将这些理论结果与在批量反应器中观察到的实验氢化速率进行关联。

Pt-Ni-Pt(111)亚表面结构对1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能都低于单金属表面，实验上表现出更高的氢化活性。这种较弱结合与较高活性之间的相关性与之前关于环烯烃氢化的研究结果一致。

虽然这项研究主要集中在1,3-CHD上，但它表明这种集成的理论和实验方法可以扩展到预测其他含C=C键分子的氢化活性，包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香烃。通过计算这些分子在各种Pt-3d催化剂表面上的结合能，研究人员可能可以预测它们的氢化活性，并利用这些信息设计更高效的催化系统。

然而，该研究并未明确提及表面d带中心计算或TPD测量。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，将这些特定方面纳入集成的理论和实验方法中，以涵盖更广泛的含C=C键分子和Pt-3d催化剂。
