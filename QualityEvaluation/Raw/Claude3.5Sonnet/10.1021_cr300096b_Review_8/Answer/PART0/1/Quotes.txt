[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

          [2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

          [3] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

          [4] "Overall, our results indicate that, at low Ni loadings, the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which in turn lead to different catalytic behavior for both the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene."

          [5] "More recently, it has been demonstrated that the structure of the bimetallic surfaces also plays a significant role in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties"

[1] "More recently, it has been demonstrated that Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, with Co atoms residing in the subsurface region in Pt(1 1 1), showed much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces has been correlated to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures"

          [2] "The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies and density functional theory (DFT) modeling of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. In these studies bimetallic surfaces, with a monolayer of Co residing directly underneath surface Pt atoms, have shown hydrogenation activity that is significantly higher than that of the parent metal, Pt or Co surfaces."

          [3] "The higher hydrogenation activity has been attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene and benzene, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

[1] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."

[2] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

[3] "Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, which should in turn lead to differences in hydrogenation activity"

[4] "Novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity is observed over the PtNiPt(1 1 1) configuration and is attributed to the fact that the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(1 1 1) and monometallic surfaces"

[1] "The different binding energies on the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) and surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structures have been explained based on the location of the surface d-band center from density functional theory (DFT) calculations"

          [2] "Surface science and DFT studies have observed that the strain effect from the lattice mismatch can modify the electronic structure of metals, which contributes to the novel activity observed on monolayer bimetallic catalysts"

          [3] "Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(1 1 1) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or the PtNi(1 1 1) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal"

          [4] "The correlations between the model surfaces and supported catalysts provide a useful example of how better hydrogenation catalysts can potentially be designed based on information from DFT modeling and surface science studies."

[1] "Our group has recently performed theoretical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have demonstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

          [2] "The coexistence of weakly adsorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways."

          [3] "The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been attributed to the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and weakly p-bonded cyclohexene [6,10,11]. In addition, the adsorption of ethylene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has also been determined to occur by the weakly p-bonded configuration [11], which is different from the di-r chemisorption of ethylene on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

          [4] "Using a similar argument, the observation of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane."

          [5] "The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The main difference is the much higher dehydrogenation activity in cyclohexene to produce benzene."

          [6] "The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity. The self-hydrogenation is nearly absent for 1-butene on ML Ni/Pt(111), most likely due to the relatively low desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed 1-butene."

[1] "According to DFT calculations, these Pt-terminated surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation."

          [2] "Previous studies have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts facilitate the hydrogenation activity in 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene reactions compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst."

          [3] "These results are consistent with surface science studies and DFT calculations that correlate binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons with hydrogenation activity. For example, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic surfaces are found to have optimal alkene binding energies, leading to higher hydrogenation activities than the monometallic Pt surface."

          [4] "Chen and coworkers have demonstrated that bimetallic catalysts formed using Pt and 3d metals outperform monometallic Pt in hydrogenation reactions of unsaturated cyclic, diene and aromatic hydrocarbons."

          [5] "For example, supported bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst for benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene."

[1] "The hydrogenation activity, together with apparent activation barrier and rate constants, were correlated with hydrogen and benzene binding energies calculated from density functional (DFT) modeling, all indicating that the benzene hydrogenation activity should follow the trend of PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPtCoRuPd."

[2] "Because of the availability of the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces,[15] the correlation of binding energies with benzene hydrogenation activity should provide potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations."

[3] "In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic systems.[17]"

[4] "In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP)."

[1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."

[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."

[3] "These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity."

[4] "Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."

[5] "On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below."

[1] "The surface d-band center values of the subsurface structures shift away from the Fermi level (Figure3), resulting in weaker binding energies of 1,4-CHD as compared to that on Pt(111)."

[2] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "However, the PtCu catalyst showed the lowest activity in spite of its relatively low binding energy of 1,4-CHD. This notable exception suggests that the simple correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is valid only for relatively simple hydrogenation reactions, such as the complete hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD to cyclohexane."

[4] "For partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

[1] "The binding energies for these linear alkenes decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Femi level, although separate trends are observed for 3 d and 5d surfaces."

[2] "DFT results predict that cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. TPD experiments for cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces show that the overall activity for cyclohexene on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is lower than on Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "Experiments also show that the PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are both less active than Pt(1 1 1), consistent with the DFT calculations."

[4] "The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene."

[5] "These observations are consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. It is generally accepted that the uncertainty in the DFT calculations of binding energies, such as those shown in Fig. 4 b for the differences in the binding energies of cyclohexene on different surfaces, is within about 0.25 eV."

[6] "The DFT results for linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) showed that the binding energies of these molecules decreased as the d-band centers moved away from the Fermi level, for 3d as well as 5d surfaces."

[7] "Experimentally, the results summarized in Table 2 typically have error bars of 10% based on multiple sets of TPD on the same surfaces. With these error bars the extent of cyclohexene reactions (last column in Table 2) follows the same general trend as the binding energy on the five surfaces."

[8] "The binding energies on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures are lower than on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, whereas the binding is stronger on the 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surface structures."

[9] "Similar to linear alkenes, it is clearly seen that the cyclohexene binding energy decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level."

[1] "DFT calculations are performed in the current study to explore whether such correlation can be extended to conjugated molecules such as 1,3-butadiene."

[2] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces"

[3] "In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."

[4] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity"

[5] "The observed activity over the PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts agrees well with DFT results which predict that the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures are good hydrogenation catalysts since they bind hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene more weakly than either Pt(1 1 1)."

[6] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."

[1] "We correlated the experimental results with density functional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

[2] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[3] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."

[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."
