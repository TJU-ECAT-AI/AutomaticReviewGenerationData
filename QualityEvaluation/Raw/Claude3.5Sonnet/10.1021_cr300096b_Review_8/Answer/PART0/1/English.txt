DFT calculations reveal that modifying Pt(111) surfaces with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals significantly alters the Pt d-band center. This correlates with experimental observations of increased hydrogenation activity for C=C bonds on PtNiPt(111) structures. While the literature doesn't provide extensive details on TPD measurements or predictions for different C=C-containing molecules, it suggests that integrating DFT calculations of d-band centers with experimental techniques can provide insights into hydrogenation activity.

          The disproportionation of cyclohexene has been used as a probe reaction to compare hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Additionally, the impregnation sequence and structure of bimetallic surfaces play significant roles in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties, affecting both cyclohexene disproportionation and selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene.

          To fully address the question, further research would be needed to:

These theoretical and experimental approaches have shown that bimetallic surfaces with Co atoms residing underneath surface Pt atoms exhibit significantly higher hydrogenation activity compared to monometallic Pt or Co surfaces.

          The enhanced hydrogenation activity of PtCo bimetallic catalysts has been attributed to the modification of electronic properties due to the formation of subsurface bimetallic structures. Specifically, the relatively weak binding energies for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons (such as cyclohexene and benzene) on these bimetallic surfaces lead to facile hydrogenation of C=C bonds.

          Although the literature does not explicitly mention TPD measurements or d-band center calculations, it suggests that the integration of theoretical (DFT) and experimental (surface science) approaches can be used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. By extending this approach to study a wider range of C=C bond-containing molecules on various Pt-3d catalyst surfaces, researchers could potentially develop a more comprehensive understanding of structure-activity relationships and design principles for improved hydrogenation catalysts.

          This approach could lead to the rational design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions, by tailoring the electronic properties of the catalyst surface to achieve the desired balance of reactant adsorption and product desorption.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts and their correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does mention some relevant concepts:

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies on bimetallic surfaces.
2. The electronic modification due to bimetallic formation affects the binding strength of adsorbates and, consequently, catalytic activity.
3. The binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, leading to differences in hydrogenation activity.
4. PtNiPt(111) surface configuration shows novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity due to weaker binding of atomic hydrogen and alkenes compared to NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces.

Surface science and DFT studies have shown that lattice mismatch strain can modify the electronic structure of metals, contributing to novel catalytic activity in monolayer bimetallic catalysts.

          Studies on model bimetallic systems have demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation due to weaker binding of hydrogen and alkenes compared to parent metals. The document suggests that correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts can inform the design of better hydrogenation catalysts based on DFT modeling and surface science studies.

          To fully address the question, additional research would be needed to:
          1. Perform DFT calculations for a range of C=C bond-containing molecules (linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatics) on various Pt-3d catalytic surfaces.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The theoretical calculations show that for Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, the d-band center of surface Pt atoms shifts away from the Fermi level due to interactions with subsurface Ni. This leads to weaker adsorption of hydrogen and olefins on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, resulting in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways observed experimentally.

          The integrated theoretical and experimental approach reveals that:
          1. Molecules like cyclohexene, ethylene, and 1-hexene adsorb in a weakly π-bonded configuration on ML Ni/Pt(111), facilitating low-temperature hydrogenation.
          2. Cyclic hydrocarbons (e.g., cyclohexene) show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to linear alkenes (e.g., 1-hexene).
          3. Chain length affects self-hydrogenation activity, with longer chains (C6) exhibiting this behavior while shorter chains (C4) do not, likely due to differences in desorption temperatures.

          This approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

This leads to higher hydrogenation rates, which is consistent with experimental observations.

          Experimental studies have demonstrated that Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts, particularly PtNi and PtCo, outperform monometallic Pt catalysts in hydrogenating various unsaturated hydrocarbons, including cyclic, diene, and aromatic compounds. For example, PtNi and PtCo catalysts show enhanced hydrogenation activity for molecules like 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

          This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

The study demonstrates that DFT-calculated hydrogen and benzene binding energies correlate well with experimental observations of benzene hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants for various bimetallic catalysts. This correlation allows for the prediction of catalytic activity trends among different bimetallic systems.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface structures of PtNi and PtCo have d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies for adsorbates like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111). This correlates with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not always straightforward, particularly for partial hydrogenation reactions. The PtCu catalyst, despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, showed the lowest overall activity but high selectivity for partial hydrogenation to cyclohexene.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design in several ways:

1. It can help identify promising bimetallic combinations for complete hydrogenation reactions by predicting binding energies and d-band center shifts.
2. For more complex reactions like partial hydrogenations, it highlights the need for more detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers.
3. It can guide the design of catalysts with specific selectivities, as demonstrated by the unexpected behavior of PtCu for partial hydrogenation.
4. The approach can be extended to study other C═C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes and aromatics, to develop a broader understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems.

To further improve this approach and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers should:

1. Combine DFT calculations with experimental techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to validate theoretical predictions of binding energies.
2. Develop more comprehensive models that account for factors beyond simple binding energies, especially for complex reaction pathways.
3. Investigate a wider range of Pt-3d combinations and surface structures to identify optimal catalysts for specific reactions.
4. Use machine learning approaches to analyze the growing body of theoretical and experimental data, potentially uncovering new trends and design principles for Pt-3d catalysts.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. Key findings include:

1. For linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene), binding energies decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, with separate trends for 3d and 5d surfaces.

2. Cyclohexene shows similar behavior, with binding energy decreasing as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level.

3. DFT predicts cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces.

4. Benzene binding on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of 1-hexene and cyclohexene.

5. TPD experiments confirm lower activity for cyclohexene on PtNiPt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1), consistent with DFT predictions.

6. PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces show lower activity than Pt(1 1 1) in both experiments and DFT calculations.

7. Subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures have lower binding energies than Pt(1 1 1), while 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) structures show stronger binding.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design by:

1. Using d-band center as a descriptor to predict binding energies and reactivity trends.
2. Correlating calculated binding energies with observed reactivity from TPD experiments.
3. Tailoring surface electronic structure by modifying composition to achieve desired binding strengths.
4. Designing bimetallic catalysts with optimal d-band centers for balanced adsorption of reactants, intermediates, and products.
5. Screening potential catalysts computationally before experimental testing.
6. Developing structure-property relationships to guide rational design of Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.

This approach enables more efficient and targeted catalyst development by providing fundamental insights into the electronic factors governing reactivity and allowing researchers to tune catalyst composition for desired activity and selectivity.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. The calculations demonstrate that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate well with the d-band center, with weaker binding observed on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This weaker binding corresponds to greater hydrogenation activity, as observed experimentally for PtCo/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces. Surfaces with d-band centers further from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker adsorbate binding, are predicted to show higher hydrogenation activity. This approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by allowing researchers to screen potential catalyst compositions and structures computationally before experimental synthesis and testing.

While the study focused on 1,3-butadiene, the approach could potentially be extended to other unsaturated hydrocarbons including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. However, additional studies would be needed to verify the correlation for these other molecule classes and to account for potential differences in adsorption geometries or reaction mechanisms.

To further develop this approach, incorporating experimental techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) could provide additional validation of the theoretical predictions and offer insights into desorption energies and surface reactions. This comprehensive strategy combining theory and experiment has the potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions.

The study demonstrates a correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies and experimental observations of hydrogenation activity for Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, specifically for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD). The research shows that surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

DFT calculations were used to predict binding energies of 1,3-CHD on various surfaces, including Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. These theoretical results were then correlated with experimental hydrogenation rates observed in a batch reactor.

The Pt-Ni-Pt(111) subsurface structure, which has lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to monometallic surfaces, showed higher hydrogenation activity experimentally. This correlation between weaker binding and higher activity is consistent with previous studies on cycloalkene hydrogenation.

While the study focuses on 1,3-CHD, it suggests that this integrated theoretical and experimental approach could be extended to predict hydrogenation activity for other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies for these molecules on various Pt-3d catalyst surfaces, researchers could potentially predict their hydrogenation activity and use this information to design more efficient catalytic systems.

The study demonstrates that DFT-calculated hydrogen and benzene binding energies correlate well with experimental observations of benzene hydrogenation activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants for various bimetallic catalysts. This correlation allows for the prediction of catalytic activity trends among different bimetallic systems.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Calculating binding energies for hydrogen and target molecules on various bimetallic surfaces using DFT.
2. Correlating these calculated binding energies with experimental hydrogenation activity data.
3. Using the established correlations to predict the hydrogenation activity of new bimetallic catalyst combinations.
4. Leveraging the large database of binding energies from DFT calculations on bimetallic surfaces to guide the selection and design of more efficient catalysts.

While the study focuses on benzene hydrogenation, the approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, to develop a more comprehensive understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems.

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The calculations consistently predict weaker binding of molecules like 1-butene, 1-hexene, cyclohexene, 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions have been experimentally verified using TPD measurements and reactor studies, demonstrating facile low-temperature hydrogenation on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential Pt-3d catalyst compositions and structures for optimal binding energies and d-band center positions.
2. Identifying promising catalyst candidates based on calculated surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies.
3. Validating theoretical predictions through targeted experimental studies, such as TPD measurements and reactor studies.
4. Iteratively refining the theoretical models based on experimental results to improve predictive capabilities.
5. Applying the validated models to design novel Pt-3d catalysts with tailored properties for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This approach allows for more efficient catalyst development by reducing the need for extensive experimental screening and providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying catalyst performance.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts generally correlate well with experimental observations for complete hydrogenation reactions. The calculations show that subsurface structures of PtNi and PtCo have d-band centers shifted away from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker binding energies for adsorbates like 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) compared to Pt(111). This correlates with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt.

However, the correlation between binding energy and hydrogenation activity is not always straightforward, particularly for partial hydrogenation reactions. The PtCu catalyst, despite having a relatively low binding energy for 1,4-CHD, showed the lowest overall activity but high selectivity for partial hydrogenation to cyclohexene.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design in several ways:

1. It can help identify promising bimetallic combinations for complete hydrogenation reactions by predicting binding energies and d-band center shifts.
2. For more complex reactions like partial hydrogenations, it highlights the need for more detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers.
3. It can guide the design of catalysts with specific selectivities, as demonstrated by the unexpected behavior of PtCu for partial hydrogenation.
4. The approach can be extended to study other C═C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes and aromatics, to develop a broader understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems.

To further improve this approach and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers should:

1. Combine DFT calculations with experimental techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to validate theoretical predictions of binding energies.
2. Develop more comprehensive models that account for factors beyond simple binding energies, especially for complex reaction pathways.
3. Investigate a wider range of Pt-3d combinations and surface structures to identify optimal catalysts for specific reactions.
4. Use machine learning approaches to analyze the growing body of theoretical and experimental data, potentially uncovering new trends and design principles for Pt-3d catalysts.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. Key findings include:

1. For linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene), binding energies decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, with separate trends for 3d and 5d surfaces.

2. Cyclohexene shows similar behavior, with binding energy decreasing as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level.

3. DFT predicts cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces.

4. Benzene binding on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of 1-hexene and cyclohexene.

5. TPD experiments confirm lower activity for cyclohexene on PtNiPt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1), consistent with DFT predictions.

6. PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces show lower activity than Pt(1 1 1) in both experiments and DFT calculations.

7. Subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures have lower binding energies than Pt(1 1 1), while 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) structures show stronger binding.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design by:

1. Using d-band center as a descriptor to predict binding energies and reactivity trends.
2. Correlating calculated binding energies with observed reactivity from TPD experiments.
3. Tailoring surface electronic structure by modifying composition to achieve desired binding strengths.
4. Designing bimetallic catalysts with optimal d-band centers for balanced adsorption of reactants, intermediates, and products.
5. Screening potential catalysts computationally before experimental testing.
6. Developing structure-property relationships to guide rational design of Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.

This approach enables more efficient and targeted catalyst development by providing fundamental insights into the electronic factors governing reactivity and allowing researchers to tune catalyst composition for desired activity and selectivity.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. The calculations demonstrate that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate well with the d-band center, with weaker binding observed on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This weaker binding corresponds to greater hydrogenation activity, as observed experimentally for PtCo/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces. Surfaces with d-band centers further from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker adsorbate binding, are predicted to show higher hydrogenation activity. This approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by allowing researchers to screen potential catalyst compositions and structures computationally before experimental synthesis and testing.

While the study focused on 1,3-butadiene, the approach could potentially be extended to other unsaturated hydrocarbons including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. However, additional studies would be needed to verify the correlation for these other molecule classes and to account for potential differences in adsorption geometries or reaction mechanisms.

To further develop this approach, incorporating experimental techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) could provide additional validation of the theoretical predictions and offer insights into desorption energies and surface reactions. This comprehensive strategy combining theory and experiment has the potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions.

The study demonstrates a correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies and experimental observations of hydrogenation activity for Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, specifically for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD). The research shows that surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

DFT calculations were used to predict binding energies of 1,3-CHD on various surfaces, including Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. These theoretical results were then correlated with experimental hydrogenation rates observed in a batch reactor.

The Pt-Ni-Pt(111) subsurface structure, which has lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to monometallic surfaces, showed higher hydrogenation activity experimentally. This correlation between weaker binding and higher activity is consistent with previous studies on cycloalkene hydrogenation.

While the study focuses on 1,3-CHD, it suggests that this integrated theoretical and experimental approach could be extended to predict hydrogenation activity for other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies for these molecules on various Pt-3d catalyst surfaces, researchers could potentially predict their hydrogenation activity and use this information to design more efficient catalytic systems.

However, the study does not explicitly mention surface d-band center calculations or TPD measurements. To fully address the question, additional research would be needed to incorporate these specific aspects into the integrated theoretical and experimental approach for a wider range of C=C bond-containing molecules and Pt-3d catalysts.
