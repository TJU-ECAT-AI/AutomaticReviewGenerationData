          [1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

          [2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

          [3] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

          [4] "Overall, our results indicate that, at low Ni loadings, the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which in turn lead to different catalytic behavior for both the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene."

          [5] "More recently, it has been demonstrated that the structure of the bimetallic surfaces also plays a significant role in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties"

          DFT calculations reveal that modifying Pt(111) surfaces with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals significantly alters the Pt d-band center. This correlates with experimental observations of increased hydrogenation activity for C=C bonds on PtNiPt(111) structures. While the literature doesn't provide extensive details on TPD measurements or predictions for different C=C-containing molecules, it suggests that integrating DFT calculations of d-band centers with experimental techniques can provide insights into hydrogenation activity.

          The disproportionation of cyclohexene has been used as a probe reaction to compare hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Additionally, the impregnation sequence and structure of bimetallic surfaces play significant roles in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties, affecting both cyclohexene disproportionation and selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene.

          To fully address the question, further research would be needed to:
          1. Conduct DFT calculations for a wider range of C=C bond-containing molecules on various Pt-3d catalysts.
          2. Perform corresponding TPD measurements for these molecules.
          3. Correlate the theoretical and experimental results to establish predictive relationships.
          4. Use these correlations to design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for specific hydrogenation reactions.

          This integrated approach could potentially lead to more targeted catalyst design and improved hydrogenation efficiency for various industrial applications, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics on different Pt-3d catalysts.

          DFT计算表明，用亚表面Ni和其他3d过渡金属修饰Pt(111)表面会显著改变Pt的d带中心。这与PtNiPt(111)结构上C=C键加氢活性增加的实验观察结果相关。虽然文献没有提供关于TPD测量或不同含C=C分子预测的详细信息，但它表明将d带中心的DFT计算与实验技术相结合可以提供关于加氢活性的见解。

          环己烯的歧化反应被用作探针反应，以比较Pt/Ni双金属表面和催化剂的氢化活性。此外，浸渍顺序和双金属表面结构在控制其电子和催化性质方面起着重要作用，影响环己烯歧化和乙烯中乙炔的选择性加氢。

          要全面回答这个问题，还需要进一步研究：
          1. 对各种Pt-3d催化剂上的更广泛的C=C键分子进行DFT计算。
          2. 对这些分子进行相应的TPD测量。
          3. 将理论和实验结果相关联，建立预测关系。
          4. 利用这些相关性为特定的氢化反应设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。

          这种综合方法可能会导致更有针对性的催化剂设计，并提高各种工业应用的氢化效率，包括不同Pt-3d催化剂上的线性烯烃、环烃和芳烃。
