          [1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."

[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."

[3] "These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity."

[4] "Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."

[5] "On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below."

          DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The calculations consistently predict weaker binding of molecules like 1-butene, 1-hexene, cyclohexene, 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions have been experimentally verified using TPD measurements and reactor studies, demonstrating facile low-temperature hydrogenation on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential Pt-3d catalyst compositions and structures for optimal binding energies and d-band center positions.
2. Identifying promising catalyst candidates based on calculated surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies.
3. Validating theoretical predictions through targeted experimental studies, such as TPD measurements and reactor studies.
4. Iteratively refining the theoretical models based on experimental results to improve predictive capabilities.
5. Applying the validated models to design novel Pt-3d catalysts with tailored properties for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This approach allows for more efficient catalyst development by reducing the need for extensive experimental screening and providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying catalyst performance.

          Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果显示出强相关性。计算结果一致地预测，在亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构上，1-丁烯、1-己烯、环己烯、1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯等分子的结合较Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面更弱。这些预测已通过TPD测量和反应器研究得到实验验证，证明了这些分子在PtNiPt(111)表面上可以进行低温易化加氢。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化体系的设计，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算筛选潜在的Pt-3d催化剂成分和结构，以获得最佳结合能和d带中心位置。
2. 基于计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能识别有前景的催化剂候选物。
3. 通过有针对性的实验研究（如TPD测量和反应器研究）验证理论预测。
4. 基于实验结果迭代优化理论模型，以提高预测准确性。
5. 将验证过的模型应用于设计具有针对特定加氢反应的定制性能的新型Pt-3d催化剂。

这种方法通过减少广泛的实验筛选需求，并提供催化剂性能背后的基本机制洞察，实现了更高效的催化剂开发。
