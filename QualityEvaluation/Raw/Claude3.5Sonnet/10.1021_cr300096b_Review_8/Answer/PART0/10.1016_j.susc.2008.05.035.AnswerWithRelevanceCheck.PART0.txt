          [1] "The binding energies for these linear alkenes decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Femi level, although separate trends are observed for 3 d and 5d surfaces."

[2] "DFT results predict that cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. TPD experiments for cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces show that the overall activity for cyclohexene on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is lower than on Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "Experiments also show that the PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are both less active than Pt(1 1 1), consistent with the DFT calculations."

[4] "The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene."

[5] "These observations are consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. It is generally accepted that the uncertainty in the DFT calculations of binding energies, such as those shown in Fig. 4 b for the differences in the binding energies of cyclohexene on different surfaces, is within about 0.25 eV."

[6] "The DFT results for linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) showed that the binding energies of these molecules decreased as the d-band centers moved away from the Fermi level, for 3d as well as 5d surfaces."

[7] "Experimentally, the results summarized in Table 2 typically have error bars of 10% based on multiple sets of TPD on the same surfaces. With these error bars the extent of cyclohexene reactions (last column in Table 2) follows the same general trend as the binding energy on the five surfaces."

[8] "The binding energies on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures are lower than on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, whereas the binding is stronger on the 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surface structures."

[9] "Similar to linear alkenes, it is clearly seen that the cyclohexene binding energy decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level."

          The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. Key findings include:

1. For linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene), binding energies decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, with separate trends for 3d and 5d surfaces.

2. Cyclohexene shows similar behavior, with binding energy decreasing as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level.

3. DFT predicts cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces.

4. Benzene binding on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of 1-hexene and cyclohexene.

5. TPD experiments confirm lower activity for cyclohexene on PtNiPt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1), consistent with DFT predictions.

6. PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces show lower activity than Pt(1 1 1) in both experiments and DFT calculations.

7. Subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures have lower binding energies than Pt(1 1 1), while 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) structures show stronger binding.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design by:

1. Using d-band center as a descriptor to predict binding energies and reactivity trends.
2. Correlating calculated binding energies with observed reactivity from TPD experiments.
3. Tailoring surface electronic structure by modifying composition to achieve desired binding strengths.
4. Designing bimetallic catalysts with optimal d-band centers for balanced adsorption of reactants, intermediates, and products.
5. Screening potential catalysts computationally before experimental testing.
6. Developing structure-property relationships to guide rational design of Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.

This approach enables more efficient and targeted catalyst development by providing fundamental insights into the electronic factors governing reactivity and allowing researchers to tune catalyst composition for desired activity and selectivity.

          DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与TPD等实验技术观察结果显示出良好的相关性。主要发现包括：

1. 对于线性烯烃（1-丁烯、1-戊烯、1-己烯），随着表面d带中心远离费米能级，结合能降低，3d和5d表面呈现不同的趋势。

2. 环己烯表现出类似行为，随着d带中心远离费米能级，结合能降低。

3. DFT预测环己烯在单金属和双金属表面上都以船型di-σ构型结合。

4. 苯在亚表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上的结合比1-己烯和环己烯更弱。

5. TPD实验证实PtNiPt(1 1 1)上的环己烯活性低于Pt(1 1 1)和NiPtPt(1 1 1)，与DFT预测一致。

6. PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)表面在实验和DFT计算中都显示出比Pt(1 1 1)更低的活性。

7. 亚表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)结构的结合能比Pt(1 1 1)低，而3d-PtPt(1 1 1)结构表现出更强的结合。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导催化剂设计：

1. 使用d带中心作为描述符来预测结合能和反应活性趋势。
2. 将计算的结合能与TPD实验观察到的反应活性相关联。
3. 通过修改组成来调整表面电子结构，以达到所需的结合强度。
4. 设计具有最佳d带中心的双金属催化剂，平衡反应物、中间体和产物的吸附。
5. 在实验测试之前对潜在催化剂进行计算筛选。
6. 建立结构-性能关系，指导Pt-3d催化系统的理性设计，用于加氢反应。

这种方法通过提供控制反应活性的电子因素的基本洞察，使研究人员能够调整催化剂组成以达到所需的活性和选择性，从而实现更高效和有针对性的催化剂开发。
