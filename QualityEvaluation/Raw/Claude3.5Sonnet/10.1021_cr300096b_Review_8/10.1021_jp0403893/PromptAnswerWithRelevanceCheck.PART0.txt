How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about DFT calculations of surface d-band centers, adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, or correlations with TPD measurements. The document focuses on CO adsorption on Pt/Pd catalysts for formic acid oxidation, and does not discuss hydrogenation of alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, or aromatics. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
