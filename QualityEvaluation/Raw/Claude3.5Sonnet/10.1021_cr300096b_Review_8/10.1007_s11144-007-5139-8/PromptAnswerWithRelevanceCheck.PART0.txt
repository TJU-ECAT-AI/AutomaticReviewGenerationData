How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. The text focuses on Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts for methane reforming with CO2, and does not discuss DFT calculations, surface d-band centers, or hydrogenation of alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, or aromatics. There is no data provided on TPD measurements or theoretical/experimental correlations for predicting hydrogenation activity. The question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

The given scientific literature does not contain any information related to DFT calculations, surface d-band centers, adsorbate binding energies, or TPD measurements for Pt-3d catalysts with various C=C bond-containing molecules. The text focuses on bimetallic PtNi catalysts for methane reforming with CO2, which is a different topic. There is insufficient information in the provided literature to answer the question about correlating DFT calculations with experimental observations for hydrogenation activity on Pt-3d catalysts.
