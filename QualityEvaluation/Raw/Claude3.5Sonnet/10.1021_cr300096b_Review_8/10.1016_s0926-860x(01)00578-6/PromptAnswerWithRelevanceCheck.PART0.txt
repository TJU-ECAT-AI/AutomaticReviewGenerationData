How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain any information about DFT calculations of surface d-band center, adsorbate binding energies, or correlations with TPD measurements for Pt-3d catalysts. The document focuses on the preparation and characterization of Pd-Fe and Pt-Fe catalysts supported on alumina using surface organometallic chemistry, and their evaluation for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation. It does not discuss the specific theoretical and experimental approaches mentioned in the question or their application to predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
