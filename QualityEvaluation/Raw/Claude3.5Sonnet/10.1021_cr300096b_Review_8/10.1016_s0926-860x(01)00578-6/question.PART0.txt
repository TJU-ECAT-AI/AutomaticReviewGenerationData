Properties of alumina supported Pd-Fe and Pt-Fe catalysts prepared using surface organometallic chemistry
Abstract
The Pd-Fe and Pt-Fe catalysts supported on alumina were prepared by a surface organometallic route using ferrocene. The materials were characterised using hydrogen chemisorption, TEM, EDX and EPR spectroscopy and evaluated for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. Addition of iron suppresses the chemisorption of hydrogen for both the palladium and platinum catalysts. The EDX analysis of Pd-Fe/Al2O3 indicated that the palladium and iron exist together on the support and EPR studies for both the iron doped palladium and platinum catalysts showed a peak at g=2.1 which can be interpreted as metallic iron possibly in interaction with the noble metal, with another at g=4.3 attributed to ferric iron. These results provide evidence for a selective reaction between the ferrocene and surface of the reduced monometallic catalyst to give iron in association with the platinum group metal. The catalysts were believed to consist mainly of palladium or platinum in close association with the iron, as MFe0 and/or the metal with an overlayer of FeOx. In the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, addition of iron appeared to suppress total hydrogenation, in particular of 1-butene. This was particularly evident for the platinum catalyst with a large decrease in n-butane formation for Pt-Fe/Al2O3 at the same activity compared to Pt/Al2O3. This enhancement in the selectivity for the Pt-Fe catalyst may be attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.
1. Introduction
Platinum-group metal-based bimetallic catalysts are an important class of catalyst with wide use, particularly within the petrochemical industry, for a variety of reactions such as reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The addition or alloying of a second metal with the platinum group metal has been shown to enhance the catalytic properties for certain reactions compared to the monometallic material. In such bimetallic materials it is important that the two components are associated together rather than existing as separate particles on the support. Thus, during the preparation of these materials particular emphasis should be placed on ensuring that the two components are in close physical and chemical contact. One method that has emerged over recent years as a selective means of adding a second metal to the surface of another uses Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC)

. This involves a controlled surface reaction between an organometallic species of the second metal with a pre-reduced monometallic platinum-group metal catalyst. Much of this work has concentrated on alkyl organometallic precursors such as tetrabutyl- or tetraethyl-tin

The work presented in this paper considers the use of ferrocene to prepare iron-doped palladium and platinum bimetallic catalysts supported on alumina using SOMC. Iron-containing bimetallics have shown interesting properties for a number of hydrogenation reactions with a variety of different platinum group metals

. In particular, the aim of this study was to determine whether iron could be selectively deposited on to the noble metal using ferrocene by this method. The catalysts were also evaluated for a model hydrogenation reaction, the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. This reaction was chosen as it has been well characterised over palladium and platinum catalysts and has been shown to be sensitive to the nature of interactions (especially electronic) between a dopant and a platinum group metal

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The Pt and Pd monometallic catalysts supported on γ-alumina (Ketjen ACZO 300) were prepared by impregnating the alumina support (surface area 180 m2 g1) with a toluene solution of bis- (acetylacetonato) platinum or bis- (acetylacetonato) palladium (Johnson Matthey), respectively. The impregnated alumina was dried at 383 K overnight and further calcined for 1 h at 623 K. The syntheses of the bimetallic catalysts were carried out using a specially designed glass reactor and saturator. The base monometallic catalyst was pre-reduced in situ in the reactor in flowing hydrogen at 623 K for 3 h then cooled to room temperature. The required amount of an n-heptane solution of the ferrocene precursor, (solvent:catalyst ratio of 2.5 cm3 g1) was loaded into the saturator. After purging in nitrogen for several minutes the contents of the saturator were transferred under nitrogen into the reactor. Hydrogen was then bubbled through the system and the progress of the reaction followed by analysis of the exit gas online using gas chromatography. Slow evaporation of the solvent was observed so further solvent was added, as necessary, via the saturator. After 24 h at room temperature the reaction was heated to 343 K for 8 h then the catalysts were dried and reduced using the same standard reduction procedure as the initial pre-reduction process above. The iron loading was chosen to represent a theoretical surface coverage of the monometallic noble metal surface sites equivalent to half a monolayer.
2.2. Characterisation
The metal content of the catalysts was determined by elemental analysis (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) by Medac Ltd, Brunel University.
The accessible metal surface area of the catalysts was determined using the volummetric chemisorption of hydrogen in a conventional pyrex vacuum system with a background vacuum pressure of 105/106 mbar. In a typical experiment, the sample (approximately 0.1 g of catalyst) was outgassed at 523 K for 1 h then, after cooling, was reduced under a static pressure (750 mbar) of hydrogen for 0.5 h at 623 K. The sample was then outgassed again at the same temperature for a further 0.5 h, then cooled under vacuum to room temperature at which point the chemisorption experiments were performed. Dosing pressures were chosen to avoid β-hydride formation for the palladium samples in the region of 010 mbar. A range of 0750 mbar was used for the platinum samples. The amount of chemisorbed gas (Qo) was calculated from the adsorption isotherm and the number of accessible surface metal atoms, Ms, deduced from the amount of hydrogen chemisorbed assuming that 1 H atom adsorbed on each Ms
[20]

[21]
.
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 2000fx Transmission Electron Microscope fitted with a side entry port. The microscope was fitted with a lanthanum hexaboride crystal filament and was equipped for energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX) using a Quantum Kevex Instrument. The sample was mounted on a carbon coated copper grid (3 mm, 200 mesh) after dispersion in methanol using an ultrasonic bath
[22]
,
[23]
. Analysis was performed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and the images obtained in bright tilt mode. The EDX analysis was performed by focussing the beam, in small spot mode, on individual catalyst particles.
The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded using a Varian E-line Century Series spectrometer operating in the X-band region. Data was typically collected for 4 min at room temperature with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and was scanned over a field range of up to 5000 G with a microwave frequency of 9.16 GHz. In addition data for some samples was also collected at or below 148 K using a nitrogen cooled cryostat.
2.3. Catalyst testing
The gas phase hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene was studied using a continuous flow microreactor system, operated at atmospheric pressure and 298 K. At the start of each test the catalyst (approximately 0.1 g) was pre-reduced in situ in 10% hydrogen in nitrogen using the standard reduction procedure at 623 K. The reaction mixture consisted of 1,3-butadiene/hydrogen/nitrogen in the molar ratio 1:1.2:10.8. Exit gases were analysed using a flame ionisation detection gas chromatograph (Ai Cambridge GC94) fitted with a 0.19% Picric Acid on Graphpac column operating isothermally at 323 K.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst preparation
The bimetallic catalysts prepared are shown in
Table 1
. The progress of the reaction of the ferrocene solution with the monometallic catalysts, was followed by monitoring evolution of the reaction products using GC analysis of the gas phase. Cyclopentane was observed after a short induction period, rising rapidly to a maximum after about 1 h, and then decreasing until, after 24 h, only small quantities were observed, indicating that at 298 K the reaction had neared completion. A similar initial burst in the reaction activity has been reported previously for the deposition of tin on Pt/C
[8]
and ruthenium on Platinum Black
[11]
using SOMC and was attributed to a proportion of the active sites being more active than the rest and reacting quickly during the initial stages of the preparation
[11]
. On heating the reaction to 343353 K further evolution occurred until after about 8 h no further products were observed. In addition, the colour intensity of the orange ferrocene in heptane solution was seen to decrease over the course of the reaction, disappearing completely after heating at 353 K indicating that complete reaction of the ferrocene had occurred. A comparison of the nominal loading of the iron with that determined experimentally (given in
Table 1
) indicates that almost all of the iron introduced to the monometallic catalysts was successfully deposited. A blank experiment with alumina alone under similar conditions did not show any evidence of cyclopentane evolution and no observable difference in the colour of the ferrocene solution. Elemental analysis of the blank material also indicated no significant deposits of iron present. That no significant reaction occurred between the ferrocene solution and alumina in the presence of hydrogen in the blank reaction suggests that ferrocene reacts selectively with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface. Iron would thus appear to be deposited, at least initially, on to the noble metal surface. Evolution of the cyclopentane species suggests that hydrogenolysis of the FeC5H5 bond occurs, followed by hydrogenation of the product. A reaction similar to that proposed for the deposition of nickel on palladium using nickelocene
[9]
,
[10]
can therefore be postulated for reaction of ferrocene with the palladium or platinum metal surface
In our reaction, the final product observed was cyclopentane rather than cyclopentadiene reported previously, suggesting that total hydrogenation had occurred although this might be subsequent to the deposition of the iron. Indeed this might be expected as the reaction was carried out under flowing hydrogen.

Pt/Al2O3 0.7  1.1
Pt-Fe/Al2O3 0.5 0.73 0.23 0.26 0.41
This appears to be the first report of the use of ferrocene to deposit iron on the surface of another metal using SOMC. Miura has however recently reported the use of ferrocene to prepare eggshell Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts based on a method using the selective chemical vapour deposition of mobile metal compounds
[24]
. In this method, the alumina is impregnated with a benzene solution of ferrocene, dried then vaporised in a stream of hydrogen at which point the author postulates that the metallocene migrates on to a catalyst particle where it decomposes catalytically, depositing the metal on the surface of the first metal. It is not clear whether this method works by the same mechanism as the controlled surface reaction using SOMC. Ferrocene has also been used to deposit iron in zeolite cages using vapour phase insertion and subsequent decomposition
[25]
.
3.2. Characterisation
3.2.1. Chemisorption and TEM
The chemisorption results for the bimetallic catalysts are also shown in
Table 1
. Inspection of the results indicates a decrease in the volume of hydrogen adsorbed by the bimetallic catalysts compared to the parent monometallic catalysts. Under our experimental conditions no hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina, and assuming that each component retains its bulk properties, the hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal. A control experiment performed using an identical preparative procedure but without the ferrocene resulted in no significant difference in the dispersion value of the palladium monometallic indicating that no significant sintering has occurred during the heat treatment involved in the preparation procedure. The TEM also indicated that the particle size of the palladium catalysts did not increase significantly on addition of the iron, with an average particle size of approximately 5 nm for both the monometallic and bimetallic palladium materials. These estimated values are almost certainly higher than the true mean as we were unable to resolve particles below 2 nm in the TEM experiment. The EDX analysis of areas of the support where no metal particles were observed by the microscope did indicate the presence of palladium providing evidence for particles below 2 nm. A representative TEM micrograph is shown in
Fig. 1
for Pd-Fe/Al2O3, with histograms showing particle size for both Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 in
Fig. 2
. The decrease in the amount of hydrogen chemisorbed observed is therefore not likely to be a consequence of a change in particle size. Assuming that the heat of adsorption and the stoichiometry of adsorption of hydrogen are not significantly influenced by the addition of the second metal, this suggests that the number of surface sites available for hydrogen chemisorption has decreased upon addition of the iron. This is similar to the results generally obtained for catalysts prepared using SOMC
[4]
,
[6]
,
[7]
. The decline in the amount of gas chemisorbed can be attributed to a geometric effect resulting from physical blockage of the platinum group metal atoms by the iron dopant or introduction of the iron between the metal atoms. Either can be interpreted as evidence for the deposition of the second metal on to the surface of the first metal. Passos et al., similarly attributed the main effect of tin addition on the chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum supported on alumina, prepared using impregnation, to be geometric in nature with electronic effects playing only a minor role, as they found that the heats of adsorption of hydrogen did not change significantly
[26]
. They also reported preferential coverage of high binding sites on platinum by the tin atoms, which would be consistent with the initial burst seen in our preparation reaction.

3.2.2. EDX analysis
The EDX analysis was performed by reducing the size of the electron beam to focus on areas occupied by individual metal particles on the surface of the support. The EDX analysis of the area occupied by a single particle of the Pd-Fe/Al2O3 is shown in
Fig. 3
. Characteristic lines for both palladium and iron are clearly visible providing evidence for the presence of iron and palladium together in the area occupied by the particle. No isolated particles of the second metal were observed on the support when focussing the beam on areas of the support alone where palladium was absent. Thus, within the detection limits of the technique, the palladium and iron were found to exist together, with no evidence for the presence of isolated iron or iron oxides on the support. This is taken as further evidence for a selective reaction between the palladium particles and the ferrocene precursor. It was not possible to obtain either electron micrographs or EDX analysis for the platinum-based catalysts due to the small particle size of these catalysts indicating that the monometallic and bimetallic platinum catalysts existed in a highly dispersed state. The chemisorption results are however consistent with the iron being closely associated with the platinum.

3.2.3. EPR
The EPR spectra of a 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with a nominal iron coverage of half a monolayer equivalent are shown in
Fig. 4
after reduction and on exposure to air. This catalyst was chosen specifically to raise the palladium loading of the monometallic to enable a higher loading of iron (nominally 0.25 wt.% corresponding to half a monolayer coverage) to be added to the catalyst. Two peaks were obtained in the EPR spectra of the 4 wt.% Pd-Fe/Al2O3 at g=4.24.3 and g=2.1. The relative intensity of these peaks, shown in
Table 2
, was found to change significantly on exposure of the reduced catalyst to air. The peak at g=4.3 can be assigned to Fe(III) in a rhombic environment
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
. The intensity of this peak did not obey Curies Law but showed a weak antiferromagnetic exchange. The signal at g=2.1 is similar to broad resonance signals quoted in the literature for Pd-Fe catalysts generally assigned to metallic iron in interaction with palladium or a PdFe alloy
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
. Sancier and Inami, for example, found that small amounts of iron present in palladium catalysts produced an intense EPR signal with a value of g=2.1 after reduction at 773 K which was not found to be present in iron samples without any palladium
[30]
. This has been attributed to metallic iron either as an alloy or in contact with the noble metal facilitating reduction by hydrogen migration or spillover
[30]
,
[32]
. A number of authors have also reported a peak at g=2.1 for PdFe alloys on a variety of different supports
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
. Faudon et al. have similarly concluded from EXAFS studies that the preparation of PdNi/SiO2 using nickelocene led to the presence of a PdNi interaction. Thus, under reduced conditions the majority of the iron species detected by EPR (
Fig. 4
b) appears to be metallic in association with the palladium, possibly as an alloy, although some Fe3+ is also present. The temperature variation of the intensity of the feature at g=2.1 (the product (intensity×temperature) increases as the temperature is decreased) was found to be consistent with this assignment, of ferromagnetic iron, most likely metallic iron, in the reduced sample.

Similar results were observed for the Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst shown in

after reduction and on exposure to air. Again there is evidence for the presence of ferric iron in the reduced sample with a signal at g=4.3 (
Fig. 5
b) as well as a peak at g=2.1 which can similarly be attributed to iron in association with the platinum
[30]
. This is consistent with results reported in the literature for carbon supported Fe-Pd and Fe-Pt and Fe-Pt/SiO2 where the presence of Fe3+ with the metallic component is reported even after reduction in hydrogen above 700 K
[12]

On exposure of the catalysts to air a decrease is seen immediately in the intensity of the peak at g=2.1 for both the palladium and platinum catalysts, (
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
c and 5c) decreasing by >50%. Further decline in the intensity of this peak is seen with respect to time (
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
d, e, 5d and e). An increase in the peak at g=4.3 is seen over the same period, especially for the platinum sample indicating reoxidation of the iron. For the Pd sample the increase is more gradual increasing by only about 25% in the first few minutes and doubling in 5 days. This suggests for the palladium sample that on exposure to air a portion (about half) of the iron species responsible for the peak at g=2.1 (Fe0 associated with palladium) are oxidised immediately, the remainder oxidising slowly over time. This is shown by comparison with
Fig. 4
a for a sample of the same catalyst left exposed to air after the initial reduction in the preparation procedure and not re-exposed to reducing conditions. For this sample the major species evident in the EPR spectrum is Fe3+ with only a small contribution from the species at g=2.1. The difference between the palladium and platinum catalysts may be due, at least in part, to the highly dispersed nature of the Pt catalyst. A study by Merlen et al.
[4]
of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 prepared using SOMC suggested that the structure depends critically on the particle size of the monometallic catalyst. For highly dispersed catalysts, they claim that the platinum is probably in interaction with tin oxide and that only when the platinum particle size is >2 nm, do PtSn0 interactions occur. Thus, as our platinum catalyst is highly dispersed we might expect a greater proportion of the iron in Pt-Fe/Al2O3 to be oxidised, even under the reduced conditions used in the hydrogenation reaction.
As the intensity of the peak attributed to Fe3+ does not increase in proportion with the decrease in the peak at g=2.1, especially for the palladium catalyst, it appears that a species which is invisible to EPR such as Fe(II) may also be formed on exposure of the catalyst to air. We can not rule out the possibility that some of this species may also exist in the reduced sample. Indeed Niemansverdriet et al., have shown evidence of small amounts of Fe2+ ions (5%) in Mssbauer studies of a reduced 1:1 Fe-Pd/SiO2 catalyst, the remaining 95% due to Fe0 in either metallic iron or FePd alloy
[34]
. Jia et al., have similarly reported evidence for Fe2+ in their studies on reduced Pt-Fe/γ-Al2O3
[35]
.
We therefore envisage a model whereby we have particles containing both the platinum group metal and iron, closely associated with oxidised iron. The amount of Fe(III) and/or Fe(II) present will depend critically on whether the catalyst is under reducing or oxidising conditions, although some oxidised iron is always present even when the catalyst is reduced. After the SOMC reaction and reduction, a certain quantity of the particle surface sites are covered by iron in a reduced state giving a noble metal/Fe0 interaction. Exposure to air results in oxidation of some or all of the surface iron to FeOx possibly resulting in a partial coverage of the platinum group metal by FeOx. Pinna et al. have similarly postulated the presence of partially oxidised iron atoms at the surface of a PdFe component on addition of iron to Pd/SiO2 prepared using impregnation
[17]
. A similar conclusion was drawn by Snchez Sierra et al.
[5]
for Ru-Ge/Al2O3 prepared by SOMC who concluded from EXAFS studies that their ruthenium particles were partially covered by a layer of GeOx. The extent of oxidation appears to be more significant for the highly dispersed Pt-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst.

show the hydrogenation profile of the monometallic and iron-doped palladium and platinum catalysts. The product selectivities of the 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation after 200 min on stream (when the selectivities were approximately steady) are shown in
Table 3
for all the catalysts. It can be seen for the palladium catalysts that the conversion decreases exponentially with time, dropping quickly over the first 20 min with a corresponding change in selectivities, with 1-butene increasing at the expense of n-butane. Deactivation of the catalysts is generally attributed to butadiene oligomerisation which blocks the catalytically active sites
[36]
,
[37]
. The increase in 1-butene at the expense of n-butane would suggest that sites responsible for further/total hydrogenation of 1-butene are gradually poisoned/removed as the reaction proceeds or that the sites required for selective formation of the butenes are created (i.e. hydrocarbonaceous overlayers). Carbonaceous deposits have been shown to be essential for the successful operation of a hydrogenation catalyst, especially with respect to selectivity, where the deposits are believed to act a hydrogen transfer medium
[38]
. The significant changes in selectivity and activity observed over the first few samples are consistent with modification of the catalyst surface by carbon during the initial minutes of the test. The clean surface is more active although not completely selective for n-butene formation.

For the bimetallic iron-doped Pd/Al2O3 catalyst the decrease in n-butane was more pronounced with no n-butane detected after 20 min. This may however, purely be a reflection of the lower activity of this catalyst as the overall conversion at which the n-butane disappears is similar to that for Pd/Al2O3. The lower initial conversion observed for the Pd-Fe catalyst may be explained simply by surface blocking of the palladium sites by iron. Indeed if the number of accessible Pd sites (from the hydrogen chemisorption results) is taken in to account then the initial activities for the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts (taken after 1 min on stream) are broadly similar although the initial n-butane selectivity is significantly greater for the monometallic. The order of selectivities for the monometallic and doped palladium catalysts after 200 min are however very similar and follow the trend generally reported in the literature. This order of selectivity was also maintained for a Pd-Fe/Al2O3 sample that had not been pre-reduced before the test. Merlen et al. similarly reported no significant change in product selectivities for Pd-Fe/Al2O3 prepared using Fe(CO)5 decomposition compared to Pd/Al2O3, they did however report a significant increase in the turnover frequency
[39]
. The overall conversion for our Pd-Fe catalyst was similar to that of Pd/Al2O3 after 200 min, although the number of accessible palladium sites, measured by chemisorption, was significantly lower for the iron-doped catalyst. The specific surface areas were however measured for the clean surface and a number of the surface sites measured in our chemisorption experiments will almost certainly have been covered up by the hydrocarbonaceous deposits during the reaction. That the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts are so similar, particularly after some time on stream, suggests that the iron may deposit on some of the same sites as the carbon. It would appear that iron has no major effect on the fundamental properties of Pd towards butadiene hydrogenation under our reaction conditions and that any initial difference observed, particularly in the selectivity, may simply be a result of geometric blocking of the Pd surface by iron.
A rapid decrease in conversion and change in the reaction products was also observed for the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. For the monometallic catalyst this is seen to level off after 40 min on stream giving n-butane as the dominant product. A high selectivity to n-butane is typically reported on supported platinum catalysts
[40]
. The rate of decline of the deactivation appears to be more gradual for the bimetallic catalyst, more closely resembling that of Pt/Al2O3 after reactivation in hydrogen/nitrogen, although the overall magnitude is greater. A significant decrease in n-butane is observed after 20 min for the iron-doped catalyst with a corresponding increase in butene formation, in particular 1-butene. The activity of the Pt-Fe/Al2O3 was also enhanced compared to that of Pt/Al2O3, particularly initially and over the first 100 min. This is especially so when the number of accessible Pt sites (shown to decrease for the Pt-Fe catalyst in the chemisorption experiments) is taken in to account. The increase in the initial activity of this catalyst suggests that although the number of sites available to chemisorb hydrogen has decreased, the activity of these sites appears to have increased. This increase is unlikely to be due to activity on the iron alone as Fe/Al2O3 was found to be inactive for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation. A similar increase in activity and selectivity to n-butenes was observed by Bertolini and Massardier for a Pt80Fe20(III) alloy
[13]
. The catalytic properties of the iron-doped catalyst were also very different to a comparable tin-doped catalyst prepared by SOMC using tetrabutyl tin
[41]
, the results of which are also given in

for a comparison. That such a significant difference is observed in the activities and product selectivities between the monometallic and the tin- and iron-doped catalysts suggests that in addition to the geometric site blocking effect discussed above, an electronic effect may also be important. A change in the electronic properties of the metal on addition of a dopant may bring about subtle changes in the strength of adsorption of the reactants and its hydrogenation products and the hydrocarbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface. We speculate that one role of the iron may be to alter the formation of the hydrocarbonaceous overlayer, thereby effecting the properties, especially the selectivity, of the catalyst.
A number of authors have reported modification of the electronic properties of platinum by iron in PtFe alloys with an electron transfer from iron to platinum
[14]
,
[15]

[16]
. Bertolini and Massardier also related the enhancement in catalytic properties of their Pt80Fe20(III) alloy to modifications of electronic properties which they observed using XPS studies as well as in the geometric arrangement of the surface
[13]
. Merlen et al. have reported that the presence of iron similarly alters the electronic nature of palladium using infra red studies of adsorbed carbon monoxide on the metal surface
[39]
. It would thus appear that the significant improvement seen in both the activity and the selectivity to n-butenes on addition of iron to Pt/Al2O3 can be attributed to both a geometric effect and an electronic effect. Similar effects may also contribute to the catalytic properties of the iron-doped palladium catalyst.
4. Conclusions
The present work shows that ferrocene can successfully be used to deposit iron on to platinum group metal catalysts using SOMC. The ferrocene appears to react selectively with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface depositing the iron, at least initially, on to the noble metal surface
After the reaction the platinum group metal (M) is believed to be closely associated with the iron, as MFe0 and/or the metal with possibly an overlayer of FeOx. The extent of oxidation of the sample depends on the environment of the catalyst although Fe3+ is always present, even under reducing conditions and is particularly significant for the Pt-Fe/Al2O3 sample. Addition of iron to Pt/Al2O3 produced a significant enhancement in both the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. Suppression of total hydrogenation was observed with a corresponding increase in selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene. This enhancement may be attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.

How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?
