Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information relevant to DFT calculations of surface d-band center, adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, or correlations with experimental TPD measurements. The document focuses on the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

This document does not contain any information about DFT calculations of surface d-band centers, adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, or correlations with experimental TPD measurements. The literature provided focuses on the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on a Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, which is unrelated to the question about hydrocarbon adsorption on Pt-3d catalysts. There is no relevant data to answer the question or make predictions about hydrogenation activity or catalyst design for Pt-3d systems.
