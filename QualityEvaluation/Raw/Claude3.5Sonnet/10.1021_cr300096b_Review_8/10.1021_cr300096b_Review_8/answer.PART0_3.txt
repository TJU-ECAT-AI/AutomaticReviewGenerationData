[1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."

[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."

[3] "These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity."

[4] "Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below."

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The DFT calculations predict weaker binding of molecules like 1-butene and 1-hexene on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions have been experimentally verified using TPD measurements, which demonstrate facile low-temperature hydrogenation of these molecules on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach has been extended to other molecules, including 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene. DFT calculations of binding energies for these molecules on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, combined with knowledge of subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, have been used to predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts. These predictions have been subsequently confirmed through reactor studies.

This integrated approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential Pt-3d catalyst compositions and structures for desired binding properties.
2. Identifying promising catalyst candidates based on calculated surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies.
3. Validating theoretical predictions through targeted experimental studies, such as TPD measurements and reactor studies.
4. Iteratively refining the theoretical models based on experimental results to improve predictive capabilities.
5. Applying the validated models to design novel Pt-3d catalysts with optimized hydrogenation activity for specific target molecules or reaction conditions.

This approach allows for a more efficient and targeted development of catalytic systems, reducing the need for extensive trial-and-error experimentation and accelerating the discovery of high-performance Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions.

Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与实验观察（如TPD测量）结果显示出很强的相关性。DFT计算预测，在亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构上，1-丁烯和1-己烯等分子的结合强度比在Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面上更弱。这些预测已通过TPD测量得到实验验证，证实了这些分子在PtNiPt(111)表面上可以进行低温加氢。

这种集成的理论和实验方法已扩展到其他分子，包括1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯。通过对这些分子在3d/Pt(111)表面上的结合能进行DFT计算，结合对亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构的了解，预测了负载型Pt3d催化剂的高加氢活性。这些预测随后通过反应器研究得到了证实。

这种集成方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计，具体方法如下：

1. 利用DFT计算筛选潜在的Pt-3d催化剂组成和结构，以获得所需的结合性质。
2. 基于计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能识别有前景的催化剂候选者。
3. 通过有针对性的实验研究（如TPD测量和反应器研究）验证理论预测。
4. 根据实验结果迭代优化理论模型，以提高预测能力。
5. 应用经验证的模型设计新型Pt-3d催化剂，针对特定目标分子或反应条件优化加氢活性。

这种方法允许更高效和有针对性地开发催化系统，减少了大量试错实验的需求，加速了高性能Pt-3d催化剂在各种加氢反应中的发现过程。
