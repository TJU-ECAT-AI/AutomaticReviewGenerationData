[5] "On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below."

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The calculations consistently predict weaker binding of molecules like 1-butene, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions have been experimentally verified, with TPD measurements confirming facile low-temperature hydrogenation of these molecules on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach has been extended to other molecules, including 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene. DFT calculations of binding energies for these molecules on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces have been used to predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts. These predictions have been subsequently confirmed through reactor studies.

This approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential Pt-3d catalyst compositions and structures for optimal binding energies.
2. Identifying promising catalyst candidates based on calculated surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies.
3. Validating theoretical predictions through targeted experimental studies, such as TPD measurements and reactor studies.
4. Iteratively refining the theoretical models based on experimental results to improve predictive accuracy.
5. Applying the validated models to design novel Pt-3d catalysts with tailored properties for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This integrated approach allows for more efficient catalyst development by reducing the need for extensive experimental screening and providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying catalyst performance.

Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等技术的实验观察结果显示出强烈的相关性。计算结果一致地预测，在亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构上，1-丁烯、1-己烯和环己烯等分子的结合较Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面更弱。这些预测已通过实验得到验证，TPD测量证实了这些分子在PtNiPt(111)表面上的低温易化氢化。

这种综合理论和实验的方法已扩展到其他分子，包括1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯。这些分子在3d/Pt(111)表面上的结合能DFT计算被用来预测负载型Pt3d催化剂的高氢化活性。这些预测随后通过反应器研究得到了证实。

这种方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化体系的设计，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算筛选潜在的Pt-3d催化剂成分和结构，以获得最佳结合能。
2. 基于计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能识别有前景的催化剂候选物。
3. 通过有针对性的实验研究（如TPD测量和反应器研究）验证理论预测。
4. 基于实验结果迭代优化理论模型，以提高预测准确性。
5. 将验证过的模型应用于设计具有针对特定氢化反应的定制性能的新型Pt-3d催化剂。

这种综合方法通过减少广泛的实验筛选需求，并提供催化剂性能背后的基本机制洞察，实现了更高效的催化剂开发。
