DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach has proven effective in predicting hydrogenation activity and informing the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

The DFT calculations consistently predict weaker binding of various molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions have been experimentally verified using TPD measurements, which demonstrate facile low-temperature hydrogenation of molecules like 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

This correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental results suggests that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as reliable descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. The approach has been extended to various molecules, including 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene.

The integrated approach allows researchers to predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts based on calculated binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures. These predictions have been subsequently confirmed through reactor studies, demonstrating the power of this combined theoretical and experimental methodology in designing and optimizing Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.
