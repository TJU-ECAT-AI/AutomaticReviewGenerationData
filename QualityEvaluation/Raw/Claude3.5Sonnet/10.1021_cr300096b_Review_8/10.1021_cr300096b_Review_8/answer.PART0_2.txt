[1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."

[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."

[3] "These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity."

[4] "Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below."

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The DFT calculations predict weaker binding of molecules like 1-butene and 1-hexene on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions are verified experimentally through TPD measurements showing facile low-temperature hydrogenation on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach has been extended to other molecules including 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene. DFT calculations of binding energies for these molecules on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, combined with information about subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, have been used to predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts. These predictions have been subsequently confirmed through reactor studies.

This approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential catalyst compositions and structures for desired binding properties.
2. Identifying promising catalyst candidates based on calculated surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies.
3. Validating theoretical predictions through targeted experimental studies such as TPD measurements and reactor studies.
4. Iteratively refining the theoretical models based on experimental results to improve predictive capabilities.

By combining theoretical calculations with experimental validation, researchers can more efficiently explore the vast space of potential catalyst compositions and structures, leading to the development of more active and selective Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与TPD测量等实验观察结果显示出强相关性。DFT计算预测，在亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构上，1-丁烯和1-己烯等分子的结合较Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面更弱。这些预测通过PtNiPt(111)表面上的低温易氢化TPD测量得到了实验验证。

这种集成的理论和实验方法已扩展到其他分子，包括1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯。这些分子在3d/Pt(111)表面上的结合能DFT计算，结合亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构的信息，被用于预测负载型Pt3d催化剂的高氢化活性。这些预测随后通过反应器研究得到了证实。

这种方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算筛选具有所需结合性能的潜在催化剂组成和结构。
2. 基于计算的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能识别有前景的催化剂候选物。
3. 通过有针对性的实验研究（如TPD测量和反应器研究）验证理论预测。
4. 根据实验结果迭代细化理论模型，以提高预测能力。

通过结合理论计算和实验验证，研究人员可以更有效地探索潜在催化剂组成和结构的广阔空间，从而开发出更活跃、更选择性的Pt-3d氢化反应催化剂。
