DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The DFT calculations predict weaker binding of molecules like 1-butene and 1-hexene on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions have been experimentally verified using TPD measurements, which demonstrated facile low-temperature hydrogenation of these molecules on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach has been extended to other molecules, including 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene. DFT calculations of binding energies for these molecules on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, combined with knowledge of subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, have been used to predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts. These predictions have been subsequently confirmed through reactor studies.

This integrated approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using DFT calculations to screen potential Pt-3d catalyst compositions and structures for optimal binding energies and d-band center positions.
2. Identifying promising catalyst candidates based on theoretical predictions.
3. Validating theoretical predictions through experimental techniques such as TPD measurements and reactor studies.
4. Iterating between theoretical predictions and experimental results to refine understanding and optimize catalyst design.

By combining theoretical calculations with experimental validation, researchers can more efficiently develop Pt-3d catalysts with improved hydrogenation activity for a wide range of C═C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics.

Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与实验观察（如TPD测量）显示出很强的相关性。DFT计算预测，在亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构上，1-丁烯和1-己烯等分子的结合强度比在Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面上更弱。这些预测已通过TPD测量得到实验验证，证明了这些分子在PtNiPt(111)表面上可以进行低温加氢。

这种集成的理论和实验方法已扩展到其他分子，包括1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯。对这些分子在3d/Pt(111)表面上的结合能进行DFT计算，结合对亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构的了解，已被用来预测负载型Pt3d催化剂的高加氢活性。这些预测随后通过反应器研究得到了证实。

这种集成方法可以用来预测加氢活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算筛选潜在的Pt-3d催化剂组成和结构，以获得最佳的结合能和d带中心位置。
2. 基于理论预测识别有前景的催化剂候选物。
3. 通过TPD测量和反应器研究等实验技术验证理论预测。
4. 在理论预测和实验结果之间迭代，以完善理解并优化催化剂设计。

通过将理论计算与实验验证相结合，研究人员可以更有效地开发出对各种含C═C键分子（包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香族化合物）具有改进加氢活性的Pt-3d催化剂。
