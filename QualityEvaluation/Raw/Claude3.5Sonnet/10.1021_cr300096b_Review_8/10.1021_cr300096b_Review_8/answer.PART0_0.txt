[1] "Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene."

[2] "Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111)."

[3] "These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity."

[4] "Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."

[5] "On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below."

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show a strong correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach has proven effective in predicting hydrogenation activity and informing the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

The DFT calculations consistently predict weaker binding of various molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures compared to Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces. These predictions have been experimentally verified using TPD measurements, which demonstrate facile low-temperature hydrogenation of molecules like 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111) surfaces.

This correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental results suggests that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can serve as reliable descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. The approach has been extended to various molecules, including 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene.

The integrated approach allows researchers to predict high hydrogenation activity for supported Pt3d catalysts based on calculated binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures. These predictions have been subsequently confirmed through reactor studies, demonstrating the power of this combined theoretical and experimental methodology in designing and optimizing Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与TPD测量等实验观察结果显示出强相关性。这种集成的理论和实验方法已被证明在预测加氢活性和指导更高效Pt-3d催化系统设计方面非常有效。

DFT计算一致预测，各种分子（包括直链烯烃、环烷烃和芳香烃）在亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构上的结合比在Pt(111)和3dPtPt(111)表面上更弱。这些预测已通过TPD测量得到实验验证，显示出1-丁烯和1-己烯在PtNiPt(111)表面上容易发生低温加氢。

理论预测和实验结果之间的这种相关性表明，DFT计算的表面d带中心和吸附结合能可以作为具有良好加氢活性的催化剂的可靠描述符。这种方法已扩展到各种分子，包括1,3-丁二烯、1,3-环己二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯。

这种集成方法使研究人员能够基于计算的结合能和亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构预测负载型Pt3d催化剂的高加氢活性。这些预测随后通过反应器研究得到了证实，展示了这种理论和实验相结合的方法在设计和优化用于加氢反应的Pt-3d催化系统方面的强大力量。
