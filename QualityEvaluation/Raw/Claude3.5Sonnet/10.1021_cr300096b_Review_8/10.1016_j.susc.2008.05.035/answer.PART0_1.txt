[1] "The DFT results for linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) showed that the binding energies of these molecules decreased as the d-band centers moved away from the Fermi level, for 3d as well as 5d surfaces."

[2] "Consistent with the strong binding energy of cyclohexene, there is a substantial pathway for decomposition on NiPtPt(1 1 1). Thus, it is hypothesized that cyclohexene bonds strongly on this surface, and is most likely di-σ-bonded as on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[3] "Experimentally, the results summarized in Table 2 typically have error bars of 10% based on multiple sets of TPD on the same surfaces. With these error bars the extent of cyclohexene reactions (last column in Table 2) follows the same general trend as the binding energy on the five surfaces."

[4] "The binding energies on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures are lower than on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, whereas the binding is stronger on the 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surface structures."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The calculations show that binding energies decrease as d-band centers move away from the Fermi level, which is consistent with experimental TPD results showing lower reactivity on surfaces with weaker binding.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Using DFT to calculate d-band centers and binding energies for potential catalyst compositions.

2. Correlating these theoretical results with experimental TPD data to validate the predictions.

3. Identifying trends in binding strength and reactivity across different bimetallic surfaces.

4. Using these trends to design new Pt-3d catalytic systems with optimal binding strengths for desired hydrogenation reactions.

5. Iterating between theory and experiment to refine predictions and optimize catalyst performance.

This approach allows for more efficient catalyst design by providing fundamental insights into the electronic structure factors that govern reactivity, enabling researchers to rationally tune catalyst composition to achieve desired activity and selectivity.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C=C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与TPD等实验技术观察结果良好相关。计算表明,随着d带中心远离费米能级,结合能降低,这与实验TPD结果显示结合较弱的表面反应性较低是一致的。

这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以用来预测氢化活性:

1. 使用DFT计算潜在催化剂组分的d带中心和结合能。

2. 将这些理论结果与实验TPD数据相关联,以验证预测。

3. 识别不同双金属表面的结合强度和反应性趋势。

4. 利用这些趋势设计新的Pt-3d催化系统,为所需的氢化反应获得最佳结合强度。

5. 在理论和实验之间反复迭代,以完善预测并优化催化剂性能。

这种方法通过提供控制反应性的电子结构因素的基本洞察,使研究人员能够理性地调整催化剂组成以达到所需的活性和选择性,从而实现更高效的催化剂设计。
