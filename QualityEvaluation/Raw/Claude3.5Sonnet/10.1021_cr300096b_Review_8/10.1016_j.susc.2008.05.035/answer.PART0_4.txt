[1] "The binding energies of these alkenes on different surfaces were then compared against the d-band center of the substrates."

[2] "Similar to linear alkenes, it is clearly seen that the cyclohexene binding energy decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level."

[3] "Consistent with the strong binding energy of cyclohexene, there is a substantial pathway for decomposition on NiPtPt(1 1 1). Thus, it is hypothesized that cyclohexene bonds strongly on this surface, and is most likely di-σ-bonded as on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[4] "In contrast, the total activity on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is much lower than either Pt(1 1 1) or NiPtPt(1 1 1), which can be attributed to the weaker binding of cyclohexene on this subsurface structure, as predicted by the DFT calculations."

[5] "Experimentally, the results summarized in Table 2 typically have error bars of 10% based on multiple sets of TPD on the same surfaces. With these error bars the extent of cyclohexene reactions (last column in Table 2) follows the same general trend as the binding energy on the five surfaces."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The binding energies of linear alkenes and cyclohexene decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. This trend is consistent across different Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces.

Experimental TPD results support the DFT predictions. For example, the strong binding energy calculated for cyclohexene on NiPtPt(1 1 1) corresponds to substantial decomposition pathways observed experimentally. Conversely, the weaker binding predicted for cyclohexene on PtNiPt(1 1 1) aligns with lower overall activity seen in TPD measurements.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by relating the calculated binding energies to observed reaction pathways and product distributions. Surfaces with moderate binding energies may offer a balance between reactant activation and product desorption, potentially leading to higher hydrogenation activity.

To design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers can use the d-band center as a descriptor to tune the electronic properties of the catalyst surface. By selecting appropriate 3d metals and controlling their position (surface vs. subsurface), it's possible to optimize the binding strength of reactants and intermediates. This approach allows for rational catalyst design, targeting specific reaction pathways and minimizing unwanted side reactions or catalyst deactivation.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C=C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附能与TPD等实验技术的观察结果显示出良好的相关性。线性烯烃和环己烯的结合能随着表面d带中心远离费米能级而降低。这种趋势在不同的Pt-3d双金属表面上是一致的。

实验TPD结果支持DFT预测。例如，在NiPtPt(1 1 1)上计算出的环己烯强结合能对应于实验中观察到的大量分解途径。相反，PtNiPt(1 1 1)上预测的环己烯较弱结合与TPD测量中观察到的较低总活性一致。

这种综合理论和实验方法可以通过将计算的结合能与观察到的反应途径和产物分布联系起来，用于预测加氢活性。具有适中结合能的表面可能在反应物活化和产物脱附之间提供平衡，可能导致更高的加氢活性。

为了设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，研究人员可以使用d带中心作为描述符来调节催化剂表面的电子性质。通过选择适当的3d金属并控制它们的位置（表面vs亚表面），可以优化反应物和中间体的结合强度。这种方法允许进行理性的催化剂设计，针对特定的反应途径并最小化不需要的副反应或催化剂失活。
