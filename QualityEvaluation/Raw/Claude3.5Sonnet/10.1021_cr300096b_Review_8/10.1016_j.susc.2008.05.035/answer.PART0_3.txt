[1] "The binding energy of the alkene adsorbates has two components, one from the coupling of the metal s states and one due to the extra coupling of the metal d-states"

[2] "The d-band centers were calculated here by carrying out separate spin-polarized calculations for all of the monometallic and bimetallic surfaces considered."

[3] "The reactivity of metal surfaces can also be correlated with their d-band centers"

[4] "Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3b show the binding energy vs. d-band center relationship for 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene, respectively."

[5] "Similar to linear alkenes, it is clearly seen that the cyclohexene binding energy decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level."

[6] "As summarized in Table 2, molecular desorption of cyclohexene dominates on these surfaces with a small activity for benzene formation and a moderate activity for decomposition on PtCuPt(1 1 1)."

[7] "Experimentally, the results summarized in Table 2 typically have error bars of 10% based on multiple sets of TPD on the same surfaces. With these error bars the extent of cyclohexene reactions (last column in Table 2) follows the same general trend as the binding energy on the five surfaces."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The study shows that:

1. There is a clear correlation between the calculated d-band center of the surface and the binding energies of linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene), cyclic hydrocarbons (cyclohexene), and aromatics (benzene).

2. The binding energies of these molecules generally decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level for both 3d and 5d surfaces.

3. TPD experiments for cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces show that the overall activity follows the same general trend as the calculated binding energies, with error bars of about 10%.

4. The subsurface Pt3d-Pt(111) structures show lower binding energies than the Pt(111) surface, while the 3d-PtPt(111) surface structures exhibit stronger binding.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Using the d-band center as a descriptor to predict binding energies and reactivity trends for various adsorbates on different Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces.

2. Tailoring the electronic structure of the catalyst surface by modifying its composition to achieve desired binding strengths for specific reactions.

3. Designing bimetallic catalysts with optimal d-band centers for balancing the adsorption strengths of reactants, intermediates, and products to enhance overall catalytic performance.

4. Utilizing the correlation between calculated binding energies and experimental reactivity to screen potential catalysts computationally before experimental testing, thus accelerating the catalyst design process.

5. Developing structure-property relationships that can guide the rational design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for various hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和含C=C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附能与TPD等实验技术的观察结果有很好的相关性。研究表明：

1. 计算得到的表面d带中心与直链烯烃(1-丁烯、1-戊烯、1-己烯)、环状烃(环己烯)和芳香族化合物(苯)的结合能之间存在明显的相关性。

2. 对于3d和5d表面，这些分子的结合能随着表面d带中心远离费米能级而普遍降低。

3. 在Ni/Pt(111)表面上进行的环己烯TPD实验表明，总体活性与计算的结合能遵循相同的一般趋势，误差范围约为10%。

4. 亚表面Pt3d-Pt(111)结构的结合能比Pt(111)表面低，而3d-PtPt(111)表面结构表现出更强的结合。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统：

1. 使用d带中心作为描述符，预测不同Pt-3d双金属表面上各种吸附质的结合能和反应活性趋势。

2. 通过修改催化剂表面的组成来调整其电子结构，以达到特定反应所需的结合强度。

3. 设计具有最佳d带中心的双金属催化剂，平衡反应物、中间体和产物的吸附强度，从而提高整体催化性能。

4. 利用计算结合能与实验反应活性之间的相关性，在实验测试之前对潜在催化剂进行计算筛选，从而加速催化剂设计过程。

5. 建立结构-性能关系，为各种加氢和脱氢反应的Pt-3d催化系统的理性设计提供指导。
