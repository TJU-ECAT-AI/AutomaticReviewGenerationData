[1] "The binding energies for these linear alkenes decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Femi level, although separate trends are observed for 3 d and 5d surfaces."

[2] "DFT results predict that cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. TPD experiments for cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces show that the overall activity for cyclohexene on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is lower than on Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "Experiments also show that the PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are both less active than Pt(1 1 1), consistent with the DFT calculations."

[4] "The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene."

[5] "These observations are consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. It is generally accepted that the uncertainty in the DFT calculations of binding energies, such as those shown in Fig. 4 b for the differences in the binding energies of cyclohexene on different surfaces, is within about 0.25 eV."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. 

For linear alkenes, the binding energies decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, with distinct trends for 3d and 5d surfaces. This correlates well with the observed reactivity trends.

For cyclic hydrocarbons like cyclohexene, DFT predicts boat di-σ configuration binding on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. TPD experiments confirm lower activity on PtNiPt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1), aligning with DFT predictions of weaker binding.

For aromatics like benzene, DFT calculates weaker binding on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces compared to linear and cyclic alkenes, which is consistent with experimental observations.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by correlating calculated binding energies with observed reactivity trends. This allows for informed design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by tailoring the surface electronic structure to achieve desired binding strengths and reactivity for specific molecules.

The approach also helps in understanding the effects of alloying on catalytic properties, as demonstrated by the consistent results for PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces showing lower activity than Pt(1 1 1) in both DFT calculations and experiments.

Overall, this integrated approach provides a powerful tool for predicting and fine-tuning the catalytic properties of Pt-3d systems for various hydrogenation reactions, enabling more efficient catalyst design.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附能与TPD等实验技术观察结果显示出良好的相关性。

对于线性烯烃，随着表面d带中心远离费米能级，结合能降低，3d和5d表面呈现不同的趋势。这与观察到的反应活性趋势很好地相关。

对于环己烯等环状烃，DFT预测在单金属和双金属表面上都以船型di-σ构型结合。TPD实验证实PtNiPt(1 1 1)上的活性低于Pt(1 1 1)和NiPtPt(1 1 1)，与DFT预测的弱结合一致。

对于苯等芳香族化合物，DFT计算表明在亚表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上的结合比线性和环状烯烃更弱，这与实验观察一致。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以通过将计算的结合能与观察到的反应活性趋势相关联来预测加氢活性。这允许通过调整表面电子结构来实现特定分子所需的结合强度和反应活性，从而为设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统提供信息。

这种方法还有助于理解合金化对催化性能的影响，正如DFT计算和实验中PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)表面都显示出比Pt(1 1 1)更低活性的一致结果所证明的那样。

总的来说，这种综合方法为预测和微调Pt-3d系统在各种加氢反应中的催化性能提供了强大的工具，使更高效的催化剂设计成为可能。

[1] "The DFT results for linear alkenes (1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene) showed that the binding energies of these molecules decreased as the d-band centers moved away from the Fermi level, for 3d as well as 5d surfaces."

[2] "Consistent with the strong binding energy of cyclohexene, there is a substantial pathway for decomposition on NiPtPt(1 1 1). Thus, it is hypothesized that cyclohexene bonds strongly on this surface, and is most likely di-σ-bonded as on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[3] "Experimentally, the results summarized in Table 2 typically have error bars of 10% based on multiple sets of TPD on the same surfaces. With these error bars the extent of cyclohexene reactions (last column in Table 2) follows the same general trend as the binding energy on the five surfaces."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The calculations show that binding energies decrease as d-band centers move away from the Fermi level, which is consistent with experimental TPD results showing lower reactivity on surfaces with weaker binding.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Using DFT to calculate d-band centers and binding energies for potential catalyst compositions.

2. Correlating these theoretical results with experimental TPD data to validate the predictions.

3. Identifying trends in binding strength and reactivity across different bimetallic surfaces.

4. Using these trends to design new Pt-3d catalytic systems with optimal binding strengths for desired hydrogenation reactions.

5. Iterating between theory and experiment to refine predictions and optimize catalyst performance.

This approach allows for more efficient catalyst design by providing fundamental insights into the electronic structure factors that govern reactivity, enabling researchers to rationally tune catalyst composition to achieve desired activity and selectivity.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The calculations predict that binding energies decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, which is consistent with experimental observations of lower activity on certain bimetallic surfaces compared to pure Pt(111).

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by using the calculated d-band center and binding energies as indicators of catalytic performance. Surfaces with d-band centers closer to the Fermi level and higher binding energies are likely to exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

The approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by allowing researchers to screen potential bimetallic compositions computationally before experimental testing. By identifying compositions that offer an optimal balance of binding strength - strong enough for activation but weak enough to allow product desorption - researchers can focus experimental efforts on the most promising candidates. This combined theoretical-experimental methodology enables more efficient and targeted catalyst development for hydrogenation and other reactions involving unsaturated hydrocarbons.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The binding energies of linear alkenes and cyclohexene decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level. This trend is consistent across different Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces.

Experimental TPD results support the DFT predictions. For example, the strong binding energy calculated for cyclohexene on NiPtPt(1 1 1) corresponds to substantial decomposition pathways observed experimentally. Conversely, the weaker binding predicted for cyclohexene on PtNiPt(1 1 1) aligns with lower overall activity seen in TPD measurements.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by relating the calculated binding energies to observed reaction pathways and product distributions. Surfaces with moderate binding energies may offer a balance between reactant activation and product desorption, potentially leading to higher hydrogenation activity.

To design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers can use the d-band center as a descriptor to tune the electronic properties of the catalyst surface. By selecting appropriate 3d metals and controlling their position (surface vs. subsurface), it's possible to optimize the binding strength of reactants and intermediates. This approach allows for rational catalyst design, targeting specific reaction pathways and minimizing unwanted side reactions or catalyst deactivation.

实验TPD结果支持DFT预测。例如，在NiPtPt(1 1 1)上计算出的环己烯强结合能对应于实验中观察到的大量分解途径。相反，PtNiPt(1 1 1)上预测的环己烯较弱结合与TPD测量中观察到的较低总活性一致。

这种综合理论和实验方法可以通过将计算的结合能与观察到的反应途径和产物分布联系起来，用于预测加氢活性。具有适中结合能的表面可能在反应物活化和产物脱附之间提供平衡，可能导致更高的加氢活性。

为了设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，研究人员可以使用d带中心作为描述符来调节催化剂表面的电子性质。通过选择适当的3d金属并控制它们的位置（表面vs亚表面），可以优化反应物和中间体的结合强度。这种方法允许进行理性的催化剂设计，针对特定的反应途径并最小化不需要的副反应或催化剂失活。
