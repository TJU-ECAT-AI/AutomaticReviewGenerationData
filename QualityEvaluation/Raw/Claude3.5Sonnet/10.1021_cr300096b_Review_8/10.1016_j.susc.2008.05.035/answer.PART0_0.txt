[1] "The binding energies for these linear alkenes decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Femi level, although separate trends are observed for 3 d and 5d surfaces."

[2] "DFT results predict that cyclohexene binds in the boat di-σ configuration on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. TPD experiments for cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces show that the overall activity for cyclohexene on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is lower than on Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "Experiments also show that the PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are both less active than Pt(1 1 1), consistent with the DFT calculations."

[4] "The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene."

[5] "These observations are consistent with the DFT results for binding energy of cyclohexene on these three surfaces. It is generally accepted that the uncertainty in the DFT calculations of binding energies, such as those shown in Fig. 4 b for the differences in the binding energies of cyclohexene on different surfaces, is within about 0.25 eV."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. 

For linear alkenes, the binding energies decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, with distinct trends for 3d and 5d surfaces. This correlates well with the observed reactivity trends.

For cyclic hydrocarbons like cyclohexene, DFT predicts boat di-σ configuration binding on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. TPD experiments confirm lower activity on PtNiPt(1 1 1) compared to Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1), aligning with DFT predictions of weaker binding.

For aromatics like benzene, DFT calculates weaker binding on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces compared to linear and cyclic alkenes, which is consistent with experimental observations.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by correlating calculated binding energies with observed reactivity trends. This allows for informed design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by tailoring the surface electronic structure to achieve desired binding strengths and reactivity for specific molecules.

The approach also helps in understanding the effects of alloying on catalytic properties, as demonstrated by the consistent results for PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces showing lower activity than Pt(1 1 1) in both DFT calculations and experiments.

Overall, this integrated approach provides a powerful tool for predicting and fine-tuning the catalytic properties of Pt-3d systems for various hydrogenation reactions, enabling more efficient catalyst design.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附能与TPD等实验技术观察结果显示出良好的相关性。

对于线性烯烃，随着表面d带中心远离费米能级，结合能降低，3d和5d表面呈现不同的趋势。这与观察到的反应活性趋势很好地相关。

对于环己烯等环状烃，DFT预测在单金属和双金属表面上都以船型di-σ构型结合。TPD实验证实PtNiPt(1 1 1)上的活性低于Pt(1 1 1)和NiPtPt(1 1 1)，与DFT预测的弱结合一致。

对于苯等芳香族化合物，DFT计算表明在亚表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上的结合比线性和环状烯烃更弱，这与实验观察一致。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以通过将计算的结合能与观察到的反应活性趋势相关联来预测加氢活性。这允许通过调整表面电子结构来实现特定分子所需的结合强度和反应活性，从而为设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统提供信息。

这种方法还有助于理解合金化对催化性能的影响，正如DFT计算和实验中PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)表面都显示出比Pt(1 1 1)更低活性的一致结果所证明的那样。

总的来说，这种综合方法为预测和微调Pt-3d系统在各种加氢反应中的催化性能提供了强大的工具，使更高效的催化剂设计成为可能。
