[1] "The binding energies for these linear alkenes decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Femi level, although separate trends are observed for 3 d and 5d surfaces."

[2] "TPD experiments for cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces show that the overall activity for cyclohexene on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface is lower than on Pt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "Experiments also show that the PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are both less active than Pt(1 1 1), consistent with the DFT calculations."

[4] "A combination of theory and experiments has been used to study the adsorption and reactivity of cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic surfaces."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The calculations predict that binding energies decrease as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, which is consistent with experimental observations of lower activity on certain bimetallic surfaces compared to pure Pt(111).

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by using the calculated d-band center and binding energies as indicators of catalytic performance. Surfaces with d-band centers closer to the Fermi level and higher binding energies are likely to exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

The approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by allowing researchers to screen potential bimetallic compositions computationally before experimental testing. By identifying compositions that offer an optimal balance of binding strength - strong enough for activation but weak enough to allow product desorption - researchers can focus experimental efforts on the most promising candidates. This combined theoretical-experimental methodology enables more efficient and targeted catalyst development for hydrogenation and other reactions involving unsaturated hydrocarbons.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和各种含C=C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与TPD等实验技术的观察结果显示出良好的相关性。计算预测结合能随表面d带中心远离费米能级而降低，这与某些双金属表面活性低于纯Pt(111)的实验观察结果一致。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过使用计算的d带中心和结合能作为催化性能的指标来预测加氢活性。d带中心更接近费米能级且结合能更高的表面可能表现出更高的加氢活性。

该方法可以通过允许研究人员在实验测试之前计算筛选潜在的双金属组成来指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。通过识别能够提供最佳结合强度平衡的组成 - 足够强以激活但又足够弱以允许产物脱附 - 研究人员可以将实验工作集中在最有前景的候选物上。这种结合理论和实验的方法能够为涉及不饱和烃的加氢和其他反应实现更高效和有针对性的催化剂开发。
