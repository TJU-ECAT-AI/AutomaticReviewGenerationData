[1] "More recently, it has been demonstrated that Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, with Co atoms residing in the subsurface region in Pt(1 1 1), showed much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces has been correlated to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures"

[2] "The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies and density functional theory (DFT) modeling of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. In these studies bimetallic surfaces, with a monolayer of Co residing directly underneath surface Pt atoms, have shown hydrogenation activity that is significantly higher than that of the parent metal, Pt or Co surfaces."

[3] "The higher hydrogenation activity has been attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene and benzene, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to this specific question about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, the document does mention some relevant information that can be extended to partially address the question:

DFT calculations and surface science studies have been used to investigate the hydrogenation activity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. These theoretical and experimental approaches have shown that bimetallic surfaces with Co atoms residing underneath surface Pt atoms exhibit significantly higher hydrogenation activity compared to monometallic Pt or Co surfaces.

The enhanced hydrogenation activity of PtCo bimetallic catalysts has been attributed to the modification of electronic properties due to the formation of subsurface bimetallic structures. Specifically, the relatively weak binding energies for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons (such as cyclohexene and benzene) on these bimetallic surfaces lead to facile hydrogenation of C=C bonds.

While the literature does not explicitly mention TPD measurements or d-band center calculations, it suggests that the integration of theoretical (DFT) and experimental (surface science) approaches can be used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. By extending this approach to study a wider range of C=C bond-containing molecules on various Pt-3d catalyst surfaces, researchers could potentially develop a more comprehensive understanding of structure-activity relationships and design principles for improved hydrogenation catalysts.

虽然文献没有提供关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算的全面答案，但文档中提到了一些相关信息，可以部分回答这个问题：

DFT计算和表面科学研究已被用于研究Co/Pt(111)双金属表面的氢化活性。这些理论和实验方法表明，Co原子位于表面Pt原子下方的双金属表面比单金属Pt或Co表面表现出显著更高的氢化活性。

PtCo双金属催化剂增强的氢化活性被归因于亚表面双金属结构形成导致的电子性质修饰。具体来说，这些双金属表面对原子氢和不饱和烃（如环己烯和苯）的相对较弱的结合能导致C=C键的易于氢化。

虽然文献没有明确提到TPD测量或d带中心计算，但它表明理论（DFT）和实验（表面科学）方法的结合可以用于预测氢化活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。通过将这种方法扩展到研究各种Pt-3d催化剂表面上更广泛的含C=C键分子，研究人员可能能够对结构-活性关系和改进氢化催化剂的设计原则发展更全面的理解。
