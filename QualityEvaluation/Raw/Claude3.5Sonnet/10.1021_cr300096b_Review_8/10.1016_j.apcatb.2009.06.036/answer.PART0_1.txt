[1] "More recently, it has been demonstrated that Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, with Co atoms residing in the subsurface region in Pt(1 1 1), showed much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces has been correlated to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures"

[2] "The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies and density functional theory (DFT) modeling of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. In these studies bimetallic surfaces, with a monolayer of Co residing directly underneath surface Pt atoms, have shown hydrogenation activity that is significantly higher than that of the parent metal, Pt or Co surfaces."

[3] "The higher hydrogenation activity has been attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene and benzene, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach combining DFT calculations and experimental techniques like TPD can be very useful for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. 

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts have shown good correlation with experimental observations. Specifically, bimetallic surfaces with subsurface Co atoms underneath Pt surface atoms have demonstrated significantly higher hydrogenation activity compared to monometallic surfaces. This enhanced activity has been attributed to the weakened binding energies of both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons on these bimetallic surfaces, facilitating easier C=C bond hydrogenation.

By combining DFT modeling of electronic structure and binding energies with experimental techniques like TPD, researchers can gain insight into the fundamental reasons for enhanced catalytic activity. This integrated approach allows for the prediction of promising bimetallic combinations and surface structures that may exhibit improved hydrogenation performance. The correlations between calculated electronic properties, measured adsorption behavior, and observed catalytic activity can guide the rational design of more efficient Pt-3d catalysts with optimized surface compositions and structures for specific hydrogenation reactions.

结合DFT计算和TPD等实验技术的综合理论和实验方法对于预测氢化活性和设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统非常有用。

对Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与实验观察结果显示了良好的相关性。具体来说,具有Pt表面原子下方亚表面Co原子的双金属表面与单金属表面相比表现出明显更高的氢化活性。这种增强的活性归因于这些双金属表面上原子氢和不饱和烃的结合能减弱,有利于更容易实现C=C键的氢化。

通过将电子结构和结合能的DFT建模与TPD等实验技术相结合,研究人员可以深入了解催化活性增强的根本原因。这种综合方法允许预测可能表现出更好氢化性能的有前景的双金属组合和表面结构。计算的电子性质、测量的吸附行为和观察到的催化活性之间的相关性可以指导理性设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂,为特定的氢化反应优化表面组成和结构。
