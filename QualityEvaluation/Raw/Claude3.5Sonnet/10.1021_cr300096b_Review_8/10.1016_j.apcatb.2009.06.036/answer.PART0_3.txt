[1] "More recently, it has been demonstrated that Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, with Co atoms residing in the subsurface region in Pt(1 1 1), showed much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces has been correlated to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures"

[2] "The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies and density functional theory (DFT) modeling of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. In these studies bimetallic surfaces, with a monolayer of Co residing directly underneath surface Pt atoms, have shown hydrogenation activity that is significantly higher than that of the parent metal, Pt or Co surfaces. The higher hydrogenation activity has been attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene and benzene, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

The literature does not provide specific details about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT modeling has been used to study the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. 

These theoretical studies, along with surface science experiments, have shown that bimetallic surfaces with Co atoms underneath surface Pt atoms exhibit significantly higher hydrogenation activity compared to monometallic Pt or Co surfaces. This enhanced activity is attributed to weaker binding energies for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons like cyclohexene and benzene on the bimetallic surfaces.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss correlations with TPD measurements, it suggests that the integrated theoretical and experimental approach has been valuable in explaining the observed higher activity of PtCo bimetallic catalysts. This combined approach of DFT calculations and surface science studies has provided insights into the electronic structure modifications caused by subsurface bimetallic formations and their impact on adsorption energies and hydrogenation activity.

To further utilize this integrated approach for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers could:

1. Extend DFT calculations to a broader range of C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes and aromatics.
2. Calculate d-band centers for various Pt-3d bimetallic surface configurations.
3. Correlate calculated binding energies and d-band centers with experimental TPD data.
4. Use the established correlations to predict hydrogenation activity for new Pt-3d combinations.
5. Design and synthesize catalysts based on these predictions, focusing on bimetallic configurations that offer optimal binding energies for target molecules.

This approach could lead to the rational design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions, by tailoring the electronic properties of the catalyst surface to achieve the desired balance of reactant adsorption and product desorption.

文献中没有具体提到在Pt-3d催化剂上对各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算细节。但是，它确实提到DFT建模被用于研究Co/Pt(111)双金属表面上环己烯的氢化反应。

这些理论研究，以及表面科学实验表明，Co原子位于表面Pt原子下方的双金属表面比单金属Pt或Co表面表现出显著更高的氢化活性。这种增强的活性归因于双金属表面上原子氢和不饱和烃（如环己烯和苯）的结合能较弱。

虽然文献没有明确讨论与TPD测量的相关性，但它表明理论和实验方法的综合应用对解释观察到的PtCo双金属催化剂的较高活性很有价值。DFT计算和表面科学研究的这种组合方法提供了关于亚表面双金属形成引起的电子结构修饰及其对吸附能和氢化活性影响的见解。

为了进一步利用这种综合方法来预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，研究人员可以：

1. 将DFT计算扩展到更广泛的含C=C键分子，包括直链烯烃和芳香族化合物。
2. 计算各种Pt-3d双金属表面构型的d带中心。
3. 将计算的结合能和d带中心与实验TPD数据相关联。
4. 利用建立的相关性预测新的Pt-3d组合的氢化活性。
5. 基于这些预测设计和合成催化剂，关注能为目标分子提供最佳结合能的双金属构型。

这种方法可以通过调整催化剂表面的电子性质，以达到反应物吸附和产物脱附之间的理想平衡，从而实现氢化反应更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的理性设计。
