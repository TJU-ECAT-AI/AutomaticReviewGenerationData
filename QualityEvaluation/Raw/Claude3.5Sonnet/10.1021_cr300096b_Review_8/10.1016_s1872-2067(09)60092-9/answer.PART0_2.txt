[1] "We correlated the experimental results with density functional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

[2] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[3] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."

The literature provides some insights into how DFT calculations of adsorbate binding energies correlate with experimental observations for Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, specifically for the hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD). However, it does not directly address the correlation between d-band center calculations and experimental techniques like TPD for a wide range of C=C bond-containing molecules.

The study shows that DFT calculations of binding energies for 1,3-CHD on different surfaces (Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic surfaces) correlate well with experimental hydrogenation activities. Specifically, the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, which has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, demonstrates the highest hydrogenation activity experimentally.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems in the following ways:

1. By calculating binding energies of target molecules on various Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces using DFT.
2. Correlating these calculated binding energies with experimental hydrogenation rates.
3. Using the established correlation to predict which bimetallic compositions and structures might exhibit higher hydrogenation activity for specific molecules.
4. Guiding the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts with optimal surface structures for desired reactions.

While this study focuses on 1,3-CHD, the approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. However, more comprehensive studies would be needed to establish broader trends across different types of molecules and a wider range of Pt-3d bimetallic systems.

该文献为Pt-Ni双金属催化剂上吸附物结合能的DFT计算如何与1,3-环己二烯(1,3-CHD)加氢的实验观察相关提供了一些见解。然而，它并未直接讨论d带中心计算与TPD等实验技术对各种含C=C键分子的相关性。

研究表明，在不同表面(Pt(111)、Ni(111)和Pt-Ni双金属表面)上1,3-CHD的结合能DFT计算与实验加氢活性有很好的相关性。具体来说，1,3-CHD结合能最低的Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面在实验中表现出最高的加氢活性。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算目标分子在各种Pt-3d双金属表面上的结合能。
2. 将这些计算的结合能与实验加氢速率相关联。
3. 利用建立的相关性来预测哪些双金属成分和结构可能对特定分子表现出更高的加氢活性。
4. 指导合成具有最佳表面结构的负载型双金属催化剂，以用于所需反应。

虽然这项研究侧重于1,3-CHD，但这种方法可能会扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括直链烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物。然而，需要进行更全面的研究来建立不同类型分子和更广泛的Pt-3d双金属系统的更广泛趋势。
