[1] "We correlated the experimental results with density functional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

[2] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[3] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts."

[4] "Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity."

The literature provides insights into how DFT calculations of adsorbate binding energies on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations and can be used to predict hydrogenation activity. 

The study demonstrates a correlation between DFT-calculated binding energies and experimental hydrogenation rates for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) on Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. Specifically, it shows that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

The researchers used DFT to calculate binding energies for 1,3-CHD on various surfaces, including Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. They found that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) configuration had lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to the monometallic surfaces. This correlated with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates on the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst.

While the study focuses on 1,3-CHD, the approach of correlating DFT-calculated binding energies with experimental activity could be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

By calculating binding energies for various adsorbates on different bimetallic configurations, researchers can identify promising catalyst compositions and structures that may exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity. This approach allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially reducing the need for extensive experimental screening.

However, it's worth noting that the study does not explicitly mention surface d-band center calculations or TPD measurements. Incorporating these additional theoretical and experimental techniques could further enhance the predictive power of this approach for designing efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

该文献提供了关于Pt-3d催化剂上吸附质结合能的DFT计算如何与实验观察相关联，以及如何用于预测加氢活性的见解。

研究表明，Pt-Ni双金属催化剂上1,3-环己二烯（1,3-CHD）的DFT计算结合能与实验加氢速率之间存在相关性。具体来说，它显示具有较弱环烯烃结合能的双金属表面通常表现出较高的加氢活性。

研究人员使用DFT计算了1,3-CHD在各种表面上的结合能，包括Pt(111)、Ni(111)和Pt-Ni双金属结构。他们发现，亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt(111)构型对1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能都低于单金属表面。这与Pt-Ni双金属催化剂上观察到的较高加氢速率的实验结果相关。

虽然该研究集中在1,3-CHD上，但将DFT计算的结合能与实验活性相关联的方法可以扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香族化合物。这种综合理论和实验的方法可用于预测加氢活性，并为设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统提供信息。

通过计算不同双金属构型上各种吸附质的结合能，研究人员可以识别可能表现出增强加氢活性的有前景的催化剂成分和结构。这种方法允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能减少广泛实验筛选的需求。

然而，值得注意的是，该研究没有明确提到表面d带中心计算或TPD测量。结合这些额外的理论和实验技术可能会进一步增强这种方法在设计高效Pt-3d催化系统方面的预测能力。
