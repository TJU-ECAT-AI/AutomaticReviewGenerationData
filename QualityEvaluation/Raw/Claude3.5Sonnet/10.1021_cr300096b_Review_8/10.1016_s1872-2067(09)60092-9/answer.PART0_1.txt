[1] "We correlated the experimental results with density functional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

[2] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[3] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."

The literature does not directly address the correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, the study does demonstrate how an integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design.

The researchers correlated experimental results with DFT calculations of binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) on different catalyst surfaces. They found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity. Specifically, the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface had lower binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces, which correlated with higher hydrogenation rates observed experimentally for the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

This approach of combining DFT calculations with experimental measurements can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. By calculating binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can identify promising catalyst compositions that may exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity. The correlation between weaker binding energies and higher activity can serve as a design principle for developing improved catalysts.

While the study focused on 1,3-CHD, the methodology could be extended to other molecules like linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics to develop a more comprehensive understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for more efficient screening of potential catalyst compositions and structures, potentially accelerating the development of more active and selective hydrogenation catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD等实验观测技术的相关性。然而，该研究确实展示了如何使用理论和实验相结合的方法来预测加氢活性并指导催化剂设计。

研究人员将实验结果与1,3-环己二烯(1,3-CHD)在不同催化剂表面上的结合能DFT计算结果进行了关联。他们发现，环烯烃结合能较弱的双金属表面通常表现出更高的加氢活性。具体来说，Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面对1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能比Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面更低，这与实验中观察到的Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂较高的加氢速率相关。

这种结合DFT计算和实验测量的方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。通过计算各种含C=C键分子在不同双金属表面上的结合能，研究人员可以识别可能表现出增强加氢活性的有前景的催化剂成分。结合能较弱与活性较高之间的相关性可以作为开发改进催化剂的设计原则。

虽然该研究focused on 1,3-CHD，但这种方法可以扩展到其他分子，如线性烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物，以对Pt-3d催化系统中的结构-活性关系建立更全面的理解。这种理论和实验相结合的方法允许更有效地筛选潜在的催化剂成分和结构，可能加速开发更活跃和选择性更高的加氢催化剂。
