[1] "We correlated the experimental results with density functional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

[2] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[3] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."

The study demonstrates how DFT calculations of binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules (specifically 1,3-cyclohexadiene) on Pt-Ni bimetallic surfaces correlate with experimental observations of hydrogenation activity. The researchers found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity.

The DFT calculations were performed for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. The results showed that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) structure had lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to the monometallic surfaces. This correlated with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. By calculating binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can identify promising catalyst compositions that may exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity. This method allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially reducing the need for extensive experimental screening of different catalyst compositions.

While the study focuses specifically on 1,3-CHD, the approach could be extended to other linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By building a comprehensive database of binding energies and correlating them with experimental results, researchers can develop predictive models for hydrogenation activity across a wide range of C=C bond-containing molecules and Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts.

该研究展示了如何将C=C键含有分子（特别是1,3-环己二烯）在Pt-Ni双金属表面上的结合能的DFT计算与氢化活性的实验观察相关联。研究人员发现，具有较弱环烯结合能的双金属表面通常表现出较高的氢化活性。

DFT计算是在Pt(111)、Ni(111)和Pt-Ni双金属结构的密堆积表面上对1,3-CHD进行的。结果表明，亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt(111)结构对1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能都低于单金属表面。这与在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上观察到的较高氢化速率的实验结果相吻合。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可用于预测氢化活性，并为设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统提供信息。通过计算不同双金属表面上各种C=C键含有分子的结合能，研究人员可以识别可能表现出增强氢化活性的有前景的催化剂组成。这种方法允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能减少对不同催化剂组成进行广泛实验筛选的需求。

虽然该研究特别关注1,3-CHD，但这种方法可以扩展到其他线性烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物。通过建立全面的结合能数据库并将其与实验结果相关联，研究人员可以开发出针对广泛的C=C键含有分子和Pt-3d双金属催化剂的氢化活性预测模型。
