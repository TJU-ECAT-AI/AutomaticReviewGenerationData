[1] "We correlated the experimental results with density functional theory calculations of the binding energy for 1,3-CHD on the corresponding model surfaces. The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

[2] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[3] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]. Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."

The study demonstrates how DFT calculations of binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules (specifically 1,3-cyclohexadiene) on Pt-Ni bimetallic surfaces correlate with experimental observations of hydrogenation activity. The researchers found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity.

The DFT calculations were performed for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. The results showed that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) structure had lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to the monometallic surfaces. This correlated with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. By calculating binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can identify promising catalyst compositions that may exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity. This method allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially reducing the need for extensive experimental screening of different catalyst compositions.

While the study focuses specifically on 1,3-CHD, the approach could be extended to other linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By building a comprehensive database of binding energies and correlating them with experimental results, researchers can develop predictive models for hydrogenation activity across a wide range of C=C bond-containing molecules and Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts.

该研究展示了如何将C=C键含有分子（特别是1,3-环己二烯）在Pt-Ni双金属表面上的结合能的DFT计算与氢化活性的实验观察相关联。研究人员发现，具有较弱环烯结合能的双金属表面通常表现出较高的氢化活性。

DFT计算是在Pt(111)、Ni(111)和Pt-Ni双金属结构的密堆积表面上对1,3-CHD进行的。结果表明，亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt(111)结构对1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能都低于单金属表面。这与在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上观察到的较高氢化速率的实验结果相吻合。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可用于预测氢化活性，并为设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统提供信息。通过计算不同双金属表面上各种C=C键含有分子的结合能，研究人员可以识别可能表现出增强氢化活性的有前景的催化剂组成。这种方法允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，可能减少对不同催化剂组成进行广泛实验筛选的需求。

虽然该研究特别关注1,3-CHD，但这种方法可以扩展到其他线性烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物。通过建立全面的结合能数据库并将其与实验结果相关联，研究人员可以开发出针对广泛的C=C键含有分子和Pt-3d双金属催化剂的氢化活性预测模型。

The literature does not directly address the correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. However, the study does demonstrate how an integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform catalyst design.

The researchers correlated experimental results with DFT calculations of binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) on different catalyst surfaces. They found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally showed higher hydrogenation activity. Specifically, the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface had lower binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces, which correlated with higher hydrogenation rates observed experimentally for the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

This approach of combining DFT calculations with experimental measurements can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. By calculating binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can identify promising catalyst compositions that may exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity. The correlation between weaker binding energies and higher activity can serve as a design principle for developing improved catalysts.

While the study focused on 1,3-CHD, the methodology could be extended to other molecules like linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics to develop a more comprehensive understanding of structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalytic systems. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for more efficient screening of potential catalyst compositions and structures, potentially accelerating the development of more active and selective hydrogenation catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算与TPD等实验观测技术的相关性。然而，该研究确实展示了如何使用理论和实验相结合的方法来预测加氢活性并指导催化剂设计。

研究人员将实验结果与1,3-环己二烯(1,3-CHD)在不同催化剂表面上的结合能DFT计算结果进行了关联。他们发现，环烯烃结合能较弱的双金属表面通常表现出更高的加氢活性。具体来说，Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面对1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能比Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面更低，这与实验中观察到的Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂较高的加氢速率相关。

这种结合DFT计算和实验测量的方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。通过计算各种含C=C键分子在不同双金属表面上的结合能，研究人员可以识别可能表现出增强加氢活性的有前景的催化剂成分。结合能较弱与活性较高之间的相关性可以作为开发改进催化剂的设计原则。

虽然该研究focused on 1,3-CHD，但这种方法可以扩展到其他分子，如线性烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物，以对Pt-3d催化系统中的结构-活性关系建立更全面的理解。这种理论和实验相结合的方法允许更有效地筛选潜在的催化剂成分和结构，可能加速开发更活跃和选择性更高的加氢催化剂。

The literature provides some insights into how DFT calculations of adsorbate binding energies correlate with experimental observations for Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, specifically for the hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD). However, it does not directly address the correlation between d-band center calculations and experimental techniques like TPD for a wide range of C=C bond-containing molecules.

The study shows that DFT calculations of binding energies for 1,3-CHD on different surfaces (Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic surfaces) correlate well with experimental hydrogenation activities. Specifically, the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, which has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, demonstrates the highest hydrogenation activity experimentally.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems in the following ways:

1. By calculating binding energies of target molecules on various Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces using DFT.
2. Correlating these calculated binding energies with experimental hydrogenation rates.
3. Using the established correlation to predict which bimetallic compositions and structures might exhibit higher hydrogenation activity for specific molecules.
4. Guiding the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts with optimal surface structures for desired reactions.

While this study focuses on 1,3-CHD, the approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. However, more comprehensive studies would be needed to establish broader trends across different types of molecules and a wider range of Pt-3d bimetallic systems.

该文献为Pt-Ni双金属催化剂上吸附物结合能的DFT计算如何与1,3-环己二烯(1,3-CHD)加氢的实验观察相关提供了一些见解。然而，它并未直接讨论d带中心计算与TPD等实验技术对各种含C=C键分子的相关性。

研究表明，在不同表面(Pt(111)、Ni(111)和Pt-Ni双金属表面)上1,3-CHD的结合能DFT计算与实验加氢活性有很好的相关性。具体来说，1,3-CHD结合能最低的Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面在实验中表现出最高的加氢活性。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以用于预测加氢活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，具体方法如下：

1. 使用DFT计算目标分子在各种Pt-3d双金属表面上的结合能。
2. 将这些计算的结合能与实验加氢速率相关联。
3. 利用建立的相关性来预测哪些双金属成分和结构可能对特定分子表现出更高的加氢活性。
4. 指导合成具有最佳表面结构的负载型双金属催化剂，以用于所需反应。

虽然这项研究侧重于1,3-CHD，但这种方法可能会扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括直链烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物。然而，需要进行更全面的研究来建立不同类型分子和更广泛的Pt-3d双金属系统的更广泛趋势。

The literature provides insights into how DFT calculations of adsorbate binding energies on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations and can be used to predict hydrogenation activity. 

The study demonstrates a correlation between DFT-calculated binding energies and experimental hydrogenation rates for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) on Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts. Specifically, it shows that bimetallic surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

The researchers used DFT to calculate binding energies for 1,3-CHD on various surfaces, including Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. They found that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) configuration had lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to the monometallic surfaces. This correlated with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates on the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst.

While the study focuses on 1,3-CHD, the approach of correlating DFT-calculated binding energies with experimental activity could be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

By calculating binding energies for various adsorbates on different bimetallic configurations, researchers can identify promising catalyst compositions and structures that may exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity. This approach allows for more targeted catalyst design, potentially reducing the need for extensive experimental screening.

However, it's worth noting that the study does not explicitly mention surface d-band center calculations or TPD measurements. Incorporating these additional theoretical and experimental techniques could further enhance the predictive power of this approach for designing efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

The literature demonstrates a correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies and experimental observations of hydrogenation activity for Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts, specifically for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD). The study shows that surfaces with weaker cycloalkene binding energies generally exhibit higher hydrogenation activity.

The research uses DFT calculations to predict binding energies of 1,3-CHD on various surfaces, including Pt(111), Ni(111), and Pt-Ni bimetallic structures. These theoretical results are then correlated with experimental hydrogenation rates observed in a batch reactor.

The Pt-Ni-Pt(111) subsurface structure, which has lower binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen compared to monometallic surfaces, shows higher hydrogenation activity experimentally. This correlation between weaker binding and higher activity is consistent with previous studies on cycloalkene hydrogenation.

While the study focuses on 1,3-CHD, it suggests that this integrated theoretical and experimental approach could be extended to predict hydrogenation activity for other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies for these molecules on various Pt-3d catalyst surfaces, researchers could potentially predict their hydrogenation activity and use this information to design more efficient catalytic systems.

However, the study does not explicitly mention d-band center calculations or TPD measurements. To fully address the question, additional research would be needed to incorporate these specific aspects into the integrated theoretical and experimental approach.
