Low temperature hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene: A comparative study between γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts
Abstract
Supported PtCo and PtNi bimetallic and Co, Ni, Pt monometallic catalysts were prepared by impregnation method on γ-Al2O3 and evaluated for the hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene at low temperatures (273343 K) and atmospheric pressure. Results from batch reactor studies with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and flow reactor studies both showed that PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity than PtNi and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts for benzene hydrogenation, while PtNi catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation. Results from H2 chemisorption and H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) studies showed that a small amount of Pt addition could increase the chemisorption capacity and make the reduction of Co or Ni much easier, especially for Co-based catalysts. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results confirmed the formation of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic bonds in the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that these two bimetallic catalysts would have higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts.
1. Introduction
The hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane is of significant importance in the petroleum industry and for environmental protection. The process of benzene hydrogenation has been utilized commercially for the production of cyclohexane, which is one of the key intermediates in the synthesis of Nylon-6 and Nylon-66
[1]
. Recently, the hydrogenation of benzene has attracted renewed attention for the reduction of the aromatic content in petroleum products, especially in gasoline and diesel
[2]
. Additionally, kinetic and thermodynamic results show that polyaromatics are more easily reduced than benzene under moderate conditions
[2]
. Thus, the development of active catalysts for benzene hydrogenation is of both fundamental and practical importance.

, have been used for the hydrogenation of benzene. Among them, Ni- and Pt-based catalysts have been extensively studied and are already used in commercial processes. Ru-based catalysts are often used for partial hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexene
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
. Some new catalytic materials, such as amorphous metal alloys
[30]
and ionic-liquid-like copolymer stabilized nanocatalysts in ionic liquids
[31]
, have also been used for benzene hydrogenation. Although supported cobalt catalysts have been widely used in FischerTropsch synthesis
[32]
,
[33]
, relatively few studies have been reported concerning benzene hydrogenation over Co-based catalysts.
It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
, including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities. Many investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces with catalytic properties

[47]
. More recently, it has been demonstrated that Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces
[32]
,
[43]
,
[47]
, with Ni or Co atoms residing in the subsurface region in Pt(111), designated as PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111), showed much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces has been correlated to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures
[47]
. In these surface science experiments the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures were prepared by depositing Ni and Co on Pt(111) at 600 K, with the subsurface structures being stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen
[47]
.
The main objective of the present work is to extend the surface science results to γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo, PtNi bimetallic catalysts and Co, Ni, Pt monometallic catalysts prepared by the impregnation method. In order to maximize the formation of the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic bonds, the atomic ratios of Ni/Pt and Co/Pt in the current work are chosen to be significantly higher than previous studies
[48]
. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the supported catalysts was used as a probe reaction to demonstrate the enhanced hydrogenation activity toward the CC bond on the bimetallic catalysts, as predicted from the surface science studies
[47]
. The hydrogenation of benzene was then investigated on the bimetallic catalysts at a relatively low temperature (343 K) and atmospheric pressure. The supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited much better performance than the others for benzene hydrogenation in both batch and flow reactor studies. On the other hand, for cyclohexene hydrogenation PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity than PtCo catalysts, consistent with predictions from surface science studies
[47]
. Furthermore, H2 chemisorption, H2-TPR and EXAFS were used to characterize the bimetallic catalysts and to determine the possible origin of the enhanced hydrogenation activities of the bimetallic catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All of the catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method. The support precursor (pseudo-boehmite) was first calcined at 823 K for 5 h before impregnation to achieve the γ-Al2O3 structure, with a BET specific surface area of 228 m2/g and a total pore volume of 0.44 cm3/g. The Co(NO3)26H2O (A.R.) precursor was dissolved in deionized water and impregnated into the support to produce a catalyst of 10 wt% Co over γ-Al2O3. The 1.2wt%Pt10wt%Co/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst was prepared by co-impregnation using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Acrs Organics, 99%) and Co(NO3)26H2O (A.R.). After the impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 383 K for 12 h and then calcined in air at 773 K for 4 h. The 10wt%Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1.2wt%Pt10wt%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared using the same method and using Ni(NO3)26H2O (A.R.) as the nickel precursor. The catalysts with 30 wt% Co or Ni loading were also prepared to make comparisons with the catalysts with 10 wt% Co or Ni loading. The compositions of all the catalysts are summarized in

.

2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
TPR experiments were performed to determine the reduction behavior of the catalysts. The experiments were carried out in a U-shaped tubular quartz reactor heated by an electric furnace. 0.010 g of calcined catalyst (6080 mesh) was exposed to a reducing gas consisting of 5.0 vol% H2 in Ar with a temperature ramp from 298 K to 1173 K at 10 K/min. The amount of hydrogen consumption was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.2.2. H2 chemisorption
H2 chemisorption experiments were carried out using the Micromeritics ASAP2010C instrument. A volumetric static method was used for H2 chemisorption. Prior to H2 chemisorption, the catalysts (0.10 g, 6080 mesh) were reduced by H2 at 723 K for 2 h and then evacuated at 723 K for 3 h, and 308 K for 1 h to desorb any hydrogen from the catalysts. The H2 adsorption isotherms were then measured to determine the H2 uptake at 308 K in the pressure range of 50450 Torr. An initial H2 adsorption isotherm was achieved to measure the total amount of adsorbed H2 (chemisorbed and physisorbed). The catalyst was then outgassed in the measurement unit and then a second H2 adsorption isotherm was measured to evaluate the amount of physisorbed H2. The total chemisorbed amount of H2 was deduced by subtracting the second isotherm from the first one and extrapolating the nearly horizontal difference curve to the uptake axis.
The uptake of H2 on the catalysts is compared in
Table 1
. The calculation of metal dispersion was based on H2 chemisorption and assumed stoichiometry of M:H2 = 2:1 (MPt, Co, Ni). Because of the large amount of Ni and Co loadings in the catalysts, the dispersion values on these catalysts are not very meaningful and are listed in
Table 1
to only provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion. However, the amount of adsorbed hydrogen provides a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among the various monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.
2.2.3. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
EXAFS measurements of the Pt LIII-edge were performed in order to confirm the presence of the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic bonds. The EXAFS experiments for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were conducted on the X18B and X19A beamlines, respectively, at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. EXAFS samples were prepared by pressing the powder catalyst into pellets using a force of approximately 3 tons per cm2. The mass of the pellets was chosen so that the samples would have a thickness on the order of two absorption lengths to optimize the signal to noise ratio. Samples were then placed into an EXAFS cell that allowed for in situ reduction and for simultaneous collection of both transmission and fluorescence signals. The catalysts were heated to 723 K at a rate of 14 K/min under a diluted hydrogen flow (5% H2 in He, 40 cc/min), and held at 723 K for 1 h before cooling to room temperature. EXAFS measurements of the Pt LIII-edge were collected at room temperature using a double crystal Si(111) monochromator. The incident and transmitted X-ray signals were measured with ionization chambers and a germanium detector was used to collect the fluorescence signal. The edge energies of the EXAFS spectra were calibrated to the edge of a Pt foil collected in transmission mode.
The EXAFS collection was collected in three energy regions: the pre-edge region from 150 to 25 eV before the edge, the near-edge region ranging from 25 eV before the edge to 40 eV past the edge, and the post-edge region from 40 eV to
(approximately 1450 eV) past the edge. The respective step sizes in each of these regions were 5 eV, 0.5 eV, and
(approximately 3 eV). Similarly the integration times varied for each region, and the times used were 1 s, 2 s, and 2 s, respectively.
The X-ray absorption data from the fluorescence signal was analyzed using the IFFEFIT 1.2.10 data analysis package (Athena, Artemis, Atoms, and FEFF6)
[49]
,
[50]
. Data reduction consisted of aligning the scans to the foil standard and deglitching each scan when necessary. The multiple scans collected for each edge were then merged to reduce experimental error and then the AUTOBK algorithm in Athena was used to remove the isolated-atom background function from the EXAFS data. The EXAFS signal was then Fourier-transformed into R-space and Artemis was used to obtain local structural information for the first coordination shell. The Pt LIII-edges were modeled by including both PtPt and Pt3d (Co or Ni) contributions in the theoretical EXAFS generated using FEFF6. The PtPt theoretical photoelectron scattering-path amplitudes and phases were calculated for the bulk Pt fcc structure. Pt3d contributions were modeled in FEFF6 by using the same Pt fcc structure with the exception that the Pt atoms in the first nearest-neighbor shell were replaced with the appropriate 3d metal atom. The seven variables used in the fitting procedure were the coordination numbers of PtPt and PtNi bonds, two corrections to the model interatomic distances, two EXAFS DebyeWaller factors (mean-square deviations in interatomic distances), and the correction to the photoelectron energy. By fitting the Pt reference foil, the passive electron reduction factor,
was determined, and this value was held fixed in the analysis of the bimetallic catalysts.
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
2.3.1. Flow reactor study
The hydrogenation of benzene was carried out in a quartz glass reactor under atmospheric pressure at 343 K. The flow of benzene, controlled by a micro-syringe pump with a flow rate of 5.6 mmol/h, was carried by H2 with a gas flow rate of 10 ml/min and N2 with a gas flow rate of 40 ml/min. For each experiment, 0.10 g of unreduced catalyst (6080 mesh) was loaded into the flow reactor. Before the reaction, the catalyst was reduced under hydrogen (20 ml/min) and nitrogen (20 ml/min) mixture at 723 K for 1 h. The product streams were analyzed by online gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).
In order to correlate with previous surface science studies
[47]
, the hydrogenation of cyclohexene was also used as a probe reaction in the same flow reactor. For each experiment, 0.040 g of unreduced catalyst was used for the catalytic evaluation under atmospheric pressure at 273 K. After the reduction of catalyst using the conditions described above, cyclohexene was injected by a micro-syringe pump at a flow rate of 4.9 mmol/h and was carried by H2 with a gas flow rate of 3 ml/min and N2 with a gas flow rate of 47 ml/min.
2.3.2. Batch reactor study using FTIR
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to monitor the concentrations of individual reactants and products during the hydrogenation of cyclohexene and benzene within a batch reactor system. The stainless steel IR cell, fitted with infrared-transparent BaF2 windows and capable of base pressures below
, allowed for in situ reduction of samples and spectroscopic measurements of either surface species or gas-phase products before, during, and after reduction/reaction. All spectra were recorded with 4 cm1 resolution using a Nicolet-470 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a MCT-A (mercury cadmium telluride) detector.
Each catalyst was supported within the reactor using a tungsten mesh (
, 100 mesh, 0.001 in wire diameter, Alfa Aesar) connected to a nickel mounting bracket at the end of a z-translating manipulator and feedthrough. Catalyst powders were pressed in direct contact with the mesh using a force of 3 tons per cm2. Also attached to the mesh was a K-type thermocouple to monitor the temperature of the catalyst during reduction. The feedthrough provided connections for the thermocouple and leads for resistive heating of the catalyst pellet through the supporting tungsten mesh. The gases and liquid vapors necessary for reduction, venting, adsorption, or hydrogenation reactions were admitted into the IR cell through a connecting gas manifold that was also maintained under high vacuum.
For all of the hydrogenation experiments, 25 mg of alumina-supported catalyst was employed. After connecting a fresh catalyst to the manipulator arm, the cell was first evacuated to a pressure below
for a minimum of 60 min in order to remove water and other impurities. The catalyst was then reduced at 723 K in 30 Torr of hydrogen for 30 min followed by evacuation and a high temperature flash (723 K) to remove any surface species generated during reduction. This reduction process was repeated three times before performing the FTIR experiments. During hydrogenation reactions, the gas-phase reactants and products were monitored by recording IR spectra (32 scans) every 30 s. The purity of cyclohexene and benzene vapors was verified in situ prior to any experimentation by comparing the IR spectrum with the standard reference reported in literature
[51]
. Before initiation of a reaction, IR spectra of the reactor cell under vacuum were collected for 10 min in order to determine an appropriate baseline. During this collection period, reactant species were premixed at room temperature within the gas manifold. For the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, hydrogen gas and cyclohexene vapor were mixed at a partial pressure ratio of 2:1, while for the benzene hydrogenation experiments the ratio of hydrogen to benzene was 6:1. To initiate the reaction, the gas/vapor mixture was rapidly dosed into the batch cell with the catalyst already heated to a chosen reaction temperature. The hydrogenation reactions proceeded at catalyst temperatures of 303 and 343 K and initial pressures of 5.5 and 8.0 Torr for cyclohexene and benzene, respectively.
The concentrations of the three main gas-phase species during the hydrogenation reactions (cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene) were estimated using the intensities of the characteristic vibrational modes at 1139 cm1 (ωCH2 rock), 1458 cm1 (CH2 deformation), and 1810 cm1 (overtone of the CC stretching mode at 993 cm1), respectively, as described in detail previously for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) reaction of cyclohexene
[48]
.
3. Results
3.1. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
The reducibility of the calcined catalysts was studied by TPR and the reduction profiles are shown in
Fig. 1
. For the pure cobalt oxide (Co3O4), there were two major peaks ascribed to the successive reduction of bulk Co3O4 to CoO to Co
[52]
. The γ-Al2O3 supported cobalt catalysts show a much broader reduction temperature range because of the strong interaction between Co and the alumina support
[32]
,
[33]
. The reduction process has been related to the following steps: Co3O4 clusters to CoO, bulk-like CoO to Co, and CoxOyAl2O3 to Co metal
[32]
. As shown in
Fig. 1
, supported PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts could be reduced at a much lower temperature than the corresponding monometallic catalysts and the reduction temperature range became narrower. For example, the reduction temperature of the first step decreased from approximately 688 K for 10%Co/γAl2O3 to 504 K for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts appears to promote the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover. Pt can be reduced at lower temperatures than Co, therefore hydrogen that dissociates on the surface of Pt could migrate to the surface of Co3O4 and support, resulting in Co being reduced at much lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts.

In comparison, for supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts the effect of Pt addition was not as effective as that of PtCo bimetallic catalysts. There was still a broad reduction temperature range for the 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, although the onset of the reduction temperature was decreased as compared to 10%Ni/γ-Al2O3.
Fig. 1
b shows the TPR results of catalysts with higher 30% Co or Ni loadings. The reduction profiles are in general similar to those of the corresponding 10% catalysts, although the hydrogen consumption was higher in
Fig. 3
b due to higher Co and Ni loadings.
3.2. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
EXAFS measurements were performed on the 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in order to verify the formation of bimetallic bonds. In the fitting of the Pt LIII-edges, the k-ranges were selected so as to exclude regions of noise at high-k. The chosen k-ranges were between 2 and 15 for the PtCo catalyst, and between 2.5 and 12 for the PtNi catalyst. The spectra for both catalysts were
-weighted in order to obtain the best fits. In Fourier-transforming the spectra, a Hanning window with a sill width of 2 Å1 was used. The resulting transformations into R-space and the fits obtained in Artemis are shown in
Fig. 2
. The fits shown in
Fig. 2
are for the first coordination shell only, and the fitting results are presented in

For the bulk metals, the CoCo, NiNi and PtPt first nearest neighbor distances are 2.506, 2.492 and 2.774 Å, respectively. If the Co, Ni and Pt were to segregate into monometallic nanoparticles, their first nearest neighbor distance would be similar or slightly smaller than that in the bulk, with the latter being due to the particle size effect on the interatomic distance. In the case of alloying, the nearest neighbor distance should be an intermediate value between the two monometallic distances. From the results in
Table 2
, the PtCo and PtNi distances are determined to be
and
, respectively. These distances are between the bulk 3d3d and PtPt distances, consistent with the presence of bimetallic bonds.
The PtCo and PtNi coordination numbers were found to be
and
, respectively, while the PtPt coordination numbers were found to be smaller in both catalysts. This indicates that there are many more Pt3d bonds than PtPt bonds, suggesting that most Pt atoms are primarily coordinated with 3d atoms, which is expected due to the large 3d/Pt atomic ratios of the PtCo and PtNi catalysts.
3.3. Flow reactor study using GC
The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces
[42]
,
[47]
, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation. Cyclohexane was the only reaction product detected by online gas chromatography.
Fig. 3
shows the conversion of cyclohexene over 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3, 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts at 273 K. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene over 10%Co/γ-Al2O3 and 10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was also tested and the catalytic activity was nearly zero, which was not shown in
Fig. 3
. It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites. More importantly, the results in
Fig. 3
clearly showed that the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts were more active than Pt, in agreement with previous studies on single crystal surfaces
[47]
. After establishing the higher hydrogenation activity for cyclohexene, the bimetallic catalysts were evaluated for benzene hydrogenation at 343 K and atmospheric pressure, which were rather moderate reaction conditions for benzene hydrogenation. Cyclohexane was the only reaction product detected by online gas chromatography. As shown in
Fig. 4
a, the conversion of benzene was nearly zero for γ-Al2O3 supported 10% Co and 10% Ni monometallic catalysts, about 5% for 1.2% Pt, and about 4% for 1.2%Pt10%Ni. In comparison, the 1.2%Pt10%Co catalyst showed a much higher conversion of 30%. When Co or Ni loading increased to 30% in the catalysts (
Fig. 4
b), the conversion of benzene was still low for the 30%Ni and 1.2%Pt30%Ni catalysts, while for the 30% Co and 1.2%Pt30%Co catalysts the conversion increased compared to the corresponding catalysts with 10% Co loading, which was partially attributed to more active sites for benzene hydrogenation (
Fig. 4
b). In particular, for the 1.2%Pt30%Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the initial conversion of benzene increased to 50%. In summary, PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed much higher activities than Co, Ni, Pt monometallic and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation. PtNi and Pt had nearly the same relatively low activities, indicating that Ni was not good for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures.

The apparent activation barriers for benzene hydrogenation reactions were estimated over several monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, as shown in

3.4. Batch reactor study using FTIR
The rates of cyclohexene and benzene hydrogenation were evaluated for the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic and Pt monometallic catalysts using a batch reactor.
Fig. 6
displays the consumption of cyclohexene and production of cyclohexane as a function of reaction time for each of the catalysts. It was observed that the rate of cyclohexane production over the bimetallic catalysts was greater than that of the monometallic Pt catalyst and that the PtNi catalyst was more active than PtCo. The experimental results were modeled using a classic LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, assuming the rate-determining step (RDS) for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene is the addition of the first hydrogen atom. The solid lines in
Fig. 6
are those obtained from the following equation for the rate of production of cyclohexane and similar expression for cyclohexene consumption using the classic LangmuirHinshelwood model:

It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction. This argument is in agreement with previous studies on cyclohexene self-hydrogenation over similar catalysts
[48]
. Benzene production was not observed to any noticeable extent over the Pt monometallic catalyst.
The rates of cyclohexane production and benzene consumption for the hydrogenation of benzene over the same three catalysts are displayed in
Fig. 7
. It was determined that the PtCo catalyst was far more active for the hydrogenation of benzene when compared to the PtNi bimetallic and Pt monometallic catalysts. The difference in rates was modeled using a classic LangmuirHinshelwood equation proposed by Saeys and coworkers
[54]
. The model assumes the stepwise addition of six hydrogen atoms to the aromatic ring, with the addition of the fifth hydrogen being the rate-determining step. From these assumptions, the following equation was obtained for the rate of cyclohexane production from the hydrogenation of benzene:

4. Discussion
Results presented above clearly demonstrate that the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The enhanced activities could be attributed to the increased reducibility of Co(Ni) oxides by the addition of Pt, and more importantly, to the formation of the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic alloys.
As indicated from the EXAFS results in
Table 2
, most of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co or Ni atoms to form the PtCo or PtNi bimetallic bonds. In addition, the PtCo or PtNi bimetallic catalysts can be reduced much more easily than the monometallic Co or Ni catalysts, as demonstrated by the H2-TPR results in
Fig. 1
. Consequently, the number of active sites is higher on the bimetallic catalysts, as supported by the H2-chemisorption results in
Table 1
. For example, the H2 uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst is 30.6 μmols/g catalyst, which is higher than the sum of uptake from the two monometallic catalysts, 14.4 and 7.2 μmols/g catalyst for 10%Co/γ-Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt/γ-Al2O3, respectively. Similar increases in H2 uptake are also observed for the other PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts listed in
Table 1
. The increase in the number of active sites on the bimetallic catalysts should partially contribute to the enhanced hydrogenation activities as compared to the monometallic catalysts.
However, the increase in the surface active sites alone cannot fully account for the magnitude of increase in the hydrogenation activities. For example, as shown in
Table 3
, the hydrogenation rate of the 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst is about 3 times higher than 1.2%Pt/γ-Al2O3 for cyclohexene hydrogenation and about 10 times higher for benzene hydrogenation, with the latter being significantly higher than the increase in the number of surface sites from H2 uptake. The enhanced hydrogenation activities are consistent with previous surface science studies

[43]
and density functional theory (DFT) modeling
[40]
,
[47]
of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces. In these studies bimetallic surfaces, with a monolayer of Co or Ni residing directly underneath surface Pt atoms, have shown hydrogenation activity that is significantly higher than that of the parent metal, Pt, Ni or Co surfaces. The higher hydrogenation activity has been attributed to the relatively weak binding energies of both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on the bimetallic surfaces, leading to a facile hydrogenation of cyclohexene
[40]
,
[47]
.
As shown in both flow reactor (
Fig. 3
,
Fig. 4
) and batch reactor (
Fig. 6
,
Fig. 7
and
Table 3
) results, although both PtCo and PtNi catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activities than the parent metals, the two types of bimetallic catalysts demonstrate quite different catalytic performance between cyclohexene and benzene hydrogenation reactions. For cyclohexene hydrogenation, PtNi bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than PtCo. This difference can be attributed to two possible origins: (1) As compared in previous surface science and DFT studies
[47]
, the PtNi bimetallic surface exhibits higher hydrogenation activity than PtCo due to a difference in the binding energy of cyclohexene. (2) As compared in
Table 1
, the H2 uptake is higher on the PtNi catalysts than PtCo, which should lead to a lower hydrogenation activity on PtCo assuming that the H2 chemisorption capacity is directly related to the hydrogenation activity.
While the trend in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene, PtNi > PtCo > Pt, is consistent with previous surface science experiments and DFT modeling on the corresponding single crystal surfaces, the significantly higher hydrogenation activity of benzene over the PtCo catalysts suggests unique hydrogenation properties. For benzene hydrogenation, the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher activity than PtNi, as illustrated in the rate constants from batch reactor studies and the apparent activation energies from flow reactor studies. As compared in
Fig. 7
and
Table 3
, the rate constant for the conversion of benzene over 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 is significantly higher than over 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3. This trend is consistent with the flow reactor results of benzene conversion in
Fig. 4
and with the estimation of the apparent activation energy in
Fig. 5
, where the value is estimated to be 33.7 kJ/mol over 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 and 56.8 kJ/mol over 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3. For both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts studied here, Co-based catalysts show higher benzene hydrogenation activity than the corresponding Ni-based counterparts, suggesting that Co is an important metal component for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures. However, the supported monometallic Co catalyst alone is not a good catalyst for benzene hydrogenation because Co metals do not adsorb and dissociate hydrogen effectively, as supported by the H2 chemisorption results that Co-based catalysts have smaller hydrogen adsorption capacity than Ni-based catalysts (
Table 1
).
Although the exact origins are unknown regarding the synergistic effect on benzene hydrogenation by alloying Pt and Co, one could argue that some of the following factors are contributing to the high benzene hydrogenation activities over the PtCo bimetallic catalysts: (1) The presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Co3O4 and leads to an increase in the number of metal sites. (2) Because Pt is an efficient catalyst for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, it could provide atomic hydrogen to the Co metal sites for hydrogenation through the spillover effect. (3) A closer inspection of the results in
Fig. 5
suggests that Co is an active hydrogenation catalyst. For example, the apparent activation barriers over the 10%Co/Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt10%Co/Al2O3 are essentially identical, at 33.7 and 33.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the role of Pt appears to be to keep Co in its reduced state and may also provide sites for the dissociation of H2. Although more detailed experimental and theoretical studies are needed to understand the origins, it is clear that γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit high activities for benzene hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures.
5. Conclusions
Supported PtCo, PtNi bimetallic and Co, Ni, Pt monometallic catalysts on γ-Al2O3 have been prepared by simple impregnation method and evaluated using flow and batch reactors for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenation at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The results showed that supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited the highest activity among all as-prepared catalysts in benzene hydrogenation, which mostly attributed to the PtCo bimetallic formation. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts, while possessing high activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation, exhibited much lower activity than PtCo catalysts in benzene hydrogenation. Overall, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts and exhibited distinct hydrogenation activities for benzene and cyclohexene, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that these bimetallic catalysts would have unique catalytic properties.
