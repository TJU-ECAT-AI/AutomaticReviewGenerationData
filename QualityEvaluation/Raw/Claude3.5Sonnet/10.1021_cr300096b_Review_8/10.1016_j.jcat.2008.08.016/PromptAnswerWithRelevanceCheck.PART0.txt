How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain any information about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. The document focuses on experimental studies of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenation, but does not discuss theoretical calculations or correlations with TPD measurements. Therefore, this specific question cannot be answered based on the given literature alone.

To properly address this question would require additional sources that cover DFT studies of Pt-3d catalysts, theoretical predictions of binding energies and d-band centers, and experimental TPD data for various hydrocarbon adsorbates. An integrated theoretical and experimental approach combining these elements could potentially provide insights for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing improved Pt-3d catalytic systems, but such an analysis is beyond the scope of the provided document.

所提供的文献中不包含有关Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算信息。该文档主要关注PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂用于苯和环己烯加氢的实验研究，但没有讨论理论计算或与TPD测量的相关性。因此，仅凭给定的文献无法回答这个具体问题。

要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来源，包括Pt-3d催化剂的DFT研究、结合能和d带中心的理论预测，以及各种碳氢化合物吸附物的实验TPD数据。结合这些元素的综合理论和实验方法可能会为预测加氢活性和设计改进的Pt-3d催化系统提供见解，但这种分析超出了所提供文档的范围。

The literature provided does not contain specific information about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it discuss correlations between such calculations and experimental techniques like TPD measurements. The document focuses on experimental studies of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenation, but does not go into the level of detail about theoretical calculations and their correlations with experiments as asked in the question. Therefore, this specific question cannot be directly answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

The document does not contain any specific information about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it discuss correlations with TPD measurements. The literature focuses on experimental studies of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenation, without providing the detailed theoretical analysis requested in the question. Therefore, this specific question cannot be directly answered based on the given literature.

However, the document does mention that previous surface science studies and DFT modeling have been used to explain enhanced hydrogenation activities of bimetallic surfaces. The literature suggests that integrating theoretical and experimental approaches can provide insights into catalyst behavior and inform catalyst design, but it does not go into the level of detail requested in the question about predicting hydrogenation activity for various C=C bond-containing molecules.

然而,该文档确实提到了以前的表面科学研究和DFT建模已被用来解释双金属表面增强的加氢活性。文献表明,整合理论和实验方法可以提供对催化剂行为的洞察,并为催化剂设计提供信息,但它并没有深入到问题所要求的关于预测各种含C=C键分子的加氢活性的详细程度。

The literature does not contain any information specifically addressing DFT calculations of surface d-band centers or adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. While the paper discusses experimental observations of hydrogenation activity for PtCo and PtNi catalysts, it does not mention DFT studies or theoretical predictions of binding energies. The document focuses on experimental results from flow reactor studies, batch reactor studies, H2-TPR, H2 chemisorption, and EXAFS characterization. It does not provide information to answer the question about correlating DFT calculations with experimental TPD measurements or using this integrated approach to predict hydrogenation activity and design catalysts.
