[1] "Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates."

[2] "The different binding energies on the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) and surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structures have been explained based on the location of the surface d-band center from density functional theory (DFT) calculations"

[3] "Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(1 1 1) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or the PtNi(1 1 1) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive correlation between DFT calculations and experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT calculations of the surface d-band center have been used to explain differences in binding energies between subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPtPt(111) structures. The document also notes that Pt-terminated surfaces exhibit weaker binding of hydrogen and alkenes compared to parent metals, leading to novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to:

1. Perform DFT calculations for a range of C=C bond-containing molecules (linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatics) on various Pt-3d catalytic surfaces.

2. Conduct corresponding experimental studies using techniques like TPD measurements.

3. Correlate the theoretical and experimental results to establish relationships between surface d-band center, binding energies, and hydrogenation activity.

4. Use these correlations to predict hydrogenation activity for new Pt-3d catalytic systems.

5. Apply the insights gained to design more efficient Pt-3d catalysts for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach could potentially lead to the development of more active and selective Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions involving various C=C bond-containing molecules.

文献并未提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种C=C键含有分子的DFT计算与实验观察之间的全面相关性。然而，它确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心已被用于解释亚表面PtNiPt(111)和表面NiPtPt(111)结构之间的结合能差异。文献还指出，Pt终止表面与父金属相比表现出较弱的氢气和烯烃结合，导致新型低温氢化活性。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究：

1. 对各种Pt-3d催化表面上的一系列C=C键含有分子（线性烯烃、环烃、芳烃）进行DFT计算。

2. 使用TPD测量等技术进行相应的实验研究。

3. 将理论和实验结果相关联，建立表面d带中心、结合能和氢化活性之间的关系。

4. 利用这些相关性预测新的Pt-3d催化系统的氢化活性。

5. 应用获得的见解设计更高效的特定氢化反应Pt-3d催化剂。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可能会导致开发出更活跃、更选择性的Pt-3d催化剂，用于涉及各种C=C键含有分子的氢化反应。
