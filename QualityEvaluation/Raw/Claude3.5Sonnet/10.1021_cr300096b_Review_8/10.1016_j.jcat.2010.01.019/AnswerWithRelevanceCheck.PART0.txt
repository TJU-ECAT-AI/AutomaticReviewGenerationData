          [1] "The different binding energies on the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) and surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structures have been explained based on the location of the surface d-band center from density functional theory (DFT) calculations"

          [2] "Surface science and DFT studies have observed that the strain effect from the lattice mismatch can modify the electronic structure of metals, which contributes to the novel activity observed on monolayer bimetallic catalysts"

          [3] "Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(1 1 1) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or the PtNi(1 1 1) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal"

          [4] "The correlations between the model surfaces and supported catalysts provide a useful example of how better hydrogenation catalysts can potentially be designed based on information from DFT modeling and surface science studies."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive correlation between DFT calculations and experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT calculations of the surface d-band center have been used to explain differences in binding energies between subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPtPt(111) structures. Surface science and DFT studies have shown that lattice mismatch strain can modify the electronic structure of metals, contributing to novel catalytic activity in monolayer bimetallic catalysts.

          Studies on model bimetallic systems have demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation due to weaker binding of hydrogen and alkenes compared to parent metals. The document suggests that correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts can inform the design of better hydrogenation catalysts based on DFT modeling and surface science studies.

          To fully address the question, additional research would be needed to:
          1. Perform DFT calculations for a range of C=C bond-containing molecules (linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, aromatics) on various Pt-3d catalytic surfaces.
          2. Conduct corresponding experimental studies using techniques like TPD measurements.
          3. Correlate the theoretical and experimental results to establish relationships between surface d-band center, binding energies, and hydrogenation activity.
          4. Use these correlations to predict hydrogenation activity for new Pt-3d catalytic systems.
          5. Apply the insights gained to design more efficient Pt-3d catalysts for specific hydrogenation reactions.

          This integrated theoretical and experimental approach could potentially lead to the development of more active and selective Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions involving various C=C bond-containing molecules.

          文献并未提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种C=C键含有分子的DFT计算与实验观察之间的全面相关性。然而，它确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心已被用于解释亚表面PtNiPt(111)和表面NiPtPt(111)结构之间的结合能差异。表面科学研究和DFT计算表明，晶格失配应变可以修改双金属催化剂中金属的电子结构，从而产生新颖的催化活性。

          对模型双金属系统的研究表明，Pt终止表面由于与亲本金属相比较弱的氢气和烯烃结合，导致新型低温氢化活性。文档指出，模型表面和负载型催化剂之间的相关性可以基于DFT建模和表面科学研究来指导更好的加氢催化剂的设计。

          要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究：
          1. 对各种Pt-3d催化表面上的一系列C=C键含有分子（线性烯烃、环烃、芳烃）进行DFT计算。
          2. 使用TPD测量等技术进行相应的实验研究。
          3. 将理论和实验结果相关联，建立表面d带中心、结合能和氢化活性之间的关系。
          4. 利用这些相关性预测新的Pt-3d催化系统的氢化活性。
          5. 应用获得的见解设计更高效的特定氢化反应Pt-3d催化剂。

          这种集成的理论和实验方法可能会导致开发出更活跃、更选择性的Pt-3d催化剂，用于涉及各种C=C键含有分子的氢化反应。
