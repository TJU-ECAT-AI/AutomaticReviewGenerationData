The document does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about correlating DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies with experimental TPD measurements for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, the literature does mention some relevant concepts that can be extended to partially address the question:

DFT calculations of surface d-band center have been used to explain differences in binding energies between subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPtPt(111) structures. This suggests that d-band center calculations can provide insights into adsorbate binding on Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces.

The document notes that combined experimental and theoretical studies have been used to investigate the thermodynamic stability and adsorbate-induced restructuring of Ni/Pt(111) monolayer bimetallic surfaces. This integrated approach of theory and experiment could potentially be extended to study hydrogenation activity.

Surface science studies and DFT calculations have shown that lattice mismatch strain can modify the electronic structure of metals in bimetallic catalysts, contributing to novel catalytic activity. This concept could be applied to predict hydrogenation activity on Pt-3d systems.

While the document does not explicitly discuss TPD measurements or predictions for specific molecules, these general principles of combining DFT and experimental techniques to study electronic structure, binding, and activity relationships on bimetallic surfaces could form the basis for developing predictive models and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

该文档并未对特定问题提供全面回答，即关于将Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与实验TPD测量相关联的问题。然而，文献确实提到了一些相关概念，可以扩展用来部分回答这个问题：

DFT计算的表面d带中心已被用于解释亚表面PtNiPt(111)和表面NiPtPt(111)结构之间的结合能差异。这表明d带中心计算可以为Pt-3d双金属表面上的吸附物结合提供洞见。

文档指出，结合实验和理论研究已被用于研究Ni/Pt(111)单层双金属表面的热力学稳定性和吸附物诱导的重构。这种理论和实验的综合方法可能可以扩展到研究氢化活性。

表面科学研究和DFT计算表明，晶格失配应变可以修改双金属催化剂中金属的电子结构，从而产生新颖的催化活性。这一概念可以应用于预测Pt-3d系统上的氢化活性。

虽然文档没有明确讨论TPD测量或特定分子的预测，但这些将DFT与实验技术相结合来研究双金属表面上电子结构、结合和活性关系的一般原理，可以作为开发预测模型和设计更高效的Pt-3d氢化反应催化剂的基础。
