[1] "Recent XPS studies on both polycrystalline Ni/Pt films and on supported Pt/Ni nanoparticles have also shown that Pt resides on the surface after reduction in H2."

[2] "Surface science and DFT studies have observed that the strain effect from the lattice mismatch can modify the electronic structure of metals, which contributes to the novel activity observed on monolayer bimetallic catalysts"

[3] "The correlations between the model surfaces and supported catalysts provide a useful example of how better hydrogenation catalysts can potentially be designed based on information from DFT modeling and surface science studies."

The literature does not provide specific information to fully answer this question about DFT calculations of surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, the document does mention that surface science and DFT studies have shown that lattice mismatch strain can modify the electronic structure of metals, contributing to novel catalytic activity in monolayer bimetallic catalysts. It also notes that correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts can inform the design of better hydrogenation catalysts based on DFT modeling and surface science studies. To fully address the question, additional research would be needed on specific DFT calculations for different C=C molecules and their correlation with experimental TPD measurements on Pt-3d catalysts.

文献中没有提供足够的具体信息来全面回答这个关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附结合能的DFT计算问题。然而,文档确实提到表面科学和DFT研究表明,晶格失配引起的应变效应可以改变金属的电子结构,这contributes to单层双金属催化剂的新颖催化活性。它还指出,模型表面和负载型催化剂之间的相关性可以基于DFT建模和表面科学研究来指导更好的加氢催化剂的设计。要全面回答这个问题,还需要对不同C=C分子的具体DFT计算及其与Pt-3d催化剂上实验TPD测量的相关性进行更多研究。
