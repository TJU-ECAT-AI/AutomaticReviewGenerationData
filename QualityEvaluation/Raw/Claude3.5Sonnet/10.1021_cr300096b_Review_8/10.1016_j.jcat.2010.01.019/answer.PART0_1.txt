[1] "Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates."

[2] "The different binding energies on the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) and surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structures have been explained based on the location of the surface d-band center from density functional theory (DFT) calculations"

[3] "Surface science and DFT studies have observed that the strain effect from the lattice mismatch can modify the electronic structure of metals, which contributes to the novel activity observed on monolayer bimetallic catalysts"

The literature does not provide detailed information specifically correlating DFT calculations of d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies with experimental TPD measurements for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, the document does mention that DFT calculations have been used to explain differences in binding energies between subsurface and surface Pt-Ni structures based on the location of the surface d-band center. Additionally, it notes that surface science and DFT studies have shown how lattice strain can modify the electronic structure of metals, contributing to novel catalytic activity in monolayer bimetallic catalysts.

To fully address the question, further research integrating theoretical DFT calculations with experimental techniques like TPD for a range of C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts would be needed. This integrated approach could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by providing insights into how electronic structure and adsorbate binding energies relate to catalytic performance across different types of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

该文献并未提供详细信息,特别是关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的DFT计算d带中心和吸附物结合能与实验TPD测量的相关性。然而,文档确实提到DFT计算已被用于解释亚表面和表面Pt-Ni结构之间的结合能差异,这是基于表面d带中心的位置。此外,它指出表面科学和DFT研究已经表明晶格应变如何能够改变金属的电子结构,从而对单层双金属催化剂的新型催化活性产生贡献。

要全面回答这个问题,需要进一步研究,将理论DFT计算与实验技术(如TPD)结合起来,针对Pt-3d催化剂上的一系列含C=C键分子进行研究。这种综合方法可能用于预测加氢活性,并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统,通过提供电子结构和吸附物结合能如何与不同类型不饱和烃的催化性能相关的见解。
