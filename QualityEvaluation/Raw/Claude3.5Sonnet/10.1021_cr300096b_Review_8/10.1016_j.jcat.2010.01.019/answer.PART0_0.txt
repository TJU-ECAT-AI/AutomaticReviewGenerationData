[1] "Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates."

[2] "The different binding energies on the subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) and surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structures have been explained based on the location of the surface d-band center from density functional theory (DFT) calculations"

[3] "Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(1 1 1) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or the PtNi(1 1 1) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive correlation between DFT calculations and experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT calculations of surface d-band center have been used to explain binding energy differences between subsurface PtNiPt(111) and surface NiPtPt(111) structures. The study also notes that Pt-terminated surfaces bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal, leading to novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity.

To fully answer the question, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach would be needed. This could involve:

1. Performing DFT calculations to determine surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d catalyst surfaces.

2. Conducting experimental TPD measurements for these molecules on the same catalyst surfaces.

3. Correlating the theoretical predictions with experimental results to validate the DFT models.

4. Using the validated models to predict hydrogenation activity for new Pt-3d catalyst compositions and structures.

5. Designing and synthesizing new catalysts based on these predictions, then experimentally testing their performance.

This iterative process of theory, experiment, and design could lead to more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions. The approach would allow researchers to explore a wide range of catalyst compositions and structures computationally before focusing experimental efforts on the most promising candidates.

文献没有提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种C=C键含有分子的DFT计算与实验观察之间的全面相关性。然而，它确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心被用来解释亚表面PtNiPt(111)和表面NiPtPt(111)结构之间的结合能差异。研究还指出，Pt终端表面比任一亲本金属更弱地结合氢和烯烃，导致新型低温氢化活性。

要全面回答这个问题，需要一个综合的理论和实验方法。这可能包括：

1. 对不同Pt-3d催化剂表面上各种C=C键含有分子进行DFT计算，确定表面d带中心和吸附质结合能。

2. 在相同的催化剂表面上对这些分子进行实验TPD测量。

3. 将理论预测与实验结果相关联，以验证DFT模型。

4. 使用验证过的模型来预测新的Pt-3d催化剂成分和结构的氢化活性。

5. 基于这些预测设计和合成新的催化剂，然后实验测试它们的性能。

这种理论、实验和设计的迭代过程可能会导致更高效的Pt-3d催化系统用于氢化反应。这种方法将允许研究人员在计算上探索广泛的催化剂成分和结构，然后将实验努力集中在最有前途的候选者上。
