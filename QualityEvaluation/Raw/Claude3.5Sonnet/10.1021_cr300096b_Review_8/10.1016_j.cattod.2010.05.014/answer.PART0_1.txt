[1] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces [6]."

[2] "Many research groups have been able to linearly correlate the binding energies of small molecules to the d-band center of various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces [9,21]. In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."

[3] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]. This weak interaction between the surface and the adsorbate allows for the novel low-temperature hydrogenation to occur."

[4] "The observed activity over the PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts agrees well with DFT results which predict that the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures are good hydrogenation catalysts since they bind hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene more weakly than either Pt(1 1 1)."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations. The study shows a linear correlation between binding energies and d-band center for 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen on various Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. 

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by considering the binding strength of adsorbates. Surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes, such as PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), display greater hydrogenation activity. This weak interaction allows for novel low-temperature hydrogenation to occur.

The approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by identifying surface structures with optimal binding energies. For example, the study found that PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts showed higher activity than Pt/-Al2O3, which agreed with DFT predictions based on weaker binding of hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene on PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures.

While the study focused on 1,3-butadiene, this approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies and correlating them with d-band centers for various molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces, researchers could predict hydrogenation activity for a wide range of compounds and design catalysts tailored for specific reactions.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和C=C键含有分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与实验观察结果有很好的相关性。研究显示,在各种Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面上,1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能与d带中心呈线性相关。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过考虑吸附质的结合强度来预测加氢活性。弱结合原子氢和烯烃的表面,如PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1),表现出更高的加氢活性。这种弱相互作用允许新型低温加氢反应的发生。

该方法可以通过识别具有最佳结合能的表面结构来指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。例如,研究发现PtCo/-Al2O3和PtNi/-Al2O3催化剂的活性高于Pt/-Al2O3,这与基于PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构对氢和1,3-丁二烯结合更弱的DFT预测一致。

虽然该研究集中在1,3-丁二烯上,但这种方法可能扩展到其他含C=C键的分子,包括线性烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物。通过计算不同Pt-3d表面上各种分子的结合能并将其与d带中心相关联,研究人员可以预测广泛化合物的加氢活性,并设计针对特定反应的催化剂。
