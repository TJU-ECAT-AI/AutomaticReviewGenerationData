          [1] "DFT calculations are performed in the current study to explore whether such correlation can be extended to conjugated molecules such as 1,3-butadiene."

[2] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces"

[3] "In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."

[4] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity"

[5] "The observed activity over the PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts agrees well with DFT results which predict that the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures are good hydrogenation catalysts since they bind hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene more weakly than either Pt(1 1 1)."

[6] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."

          The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. The calculations demonstrate that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate well with the d-band center, with weaker binding observed on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This weaker binding corresponds to greater hydrogenation activity, as observed experimentally for PtCo/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces. Surfaces with d-band centers further from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker adsorbate binding, are predicted to show higher hydrogenation activity. This approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by allowing researchers to screen potential catalyst compositions and structures computationally before experimental synthesis and testing.

While the study focused on 1,3-butadiene, the approach could potentially be extended to other unsaturated hydrocarbons including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. However, additional studies would be needed to verify the correlation for these other molecule classes and to account for potential differences in adsorption geometries or reaction mechanisms.

To further develop this approach, incorporating experimental techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) could provide additional validation of the theoretical predictions and offer insights into desorption energies and surface reactions. This comprehensive strategy combining theory and experiment has the potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions.

          DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和1,3-丁二烯吸附结合能与批量反应器和流动反应器研究的实验观察结果显示出良好的相关性。计算结果表明，1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能都与d带中心很好地相关，在PtCoPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上观察到较弱的结合。这种较弱的结合对应于更高的氢化活性，在PtCo/γ-Al2O3和PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂的实验中也观察到了这一点。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过计算不同Pt-3d表面上各种含C=C键分子的d带中心和结合能来预测加氢活性。预计d带中心距费米能级较远的表面会显示出较弱的吸附剂结合，从而表现出较高的加氢活性。这种方法可以通过允许研究人员在实验合成和测试之前计算筛选潜在的催化剂组成和结构，来指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。

虽然该研究主要针对1,3-丁二烯，但这种方法可能扩展到其他不饱和碳氢化合物，包括线性烯烃、环状碳氢化合物和芳香族化合物。然而，需要进行额外的研究来验证这些其他分子类别的相关性，并考虑吸附几何或反应机理的潜在差异。

为了进一步发展这种方法，结合程序升温脱附（TPD）等实验技术可以为理论预测提供额外的验证，并提供关于脱附能和表面反应的见解。这种结合理论和实验的综合策略有潜力加速各种氢化反应的Pt-3d催化剂的发现和优化。
