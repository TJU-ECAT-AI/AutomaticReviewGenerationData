[4] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity"

[5] "The observed activity over the PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts agrees well with DFT results which predict that the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures are good hydrogenation catalysts since they bind hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene more weakly than either Pt(1 1 1)."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts show good correlation with experimental observations of hydrogenation activity. The study found that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate well with the d-band center, with weaker binding observed on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This weaker binding corresponds to greater hydrogenation activity, as observed experimentally for PtCo/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces. Surfaces with d-band centers further from the Fermi level, resulting in weaker adsorbate binding, are predicted to show higher hydrogenation activity. This approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by allowing researchers to screen potential catalyst compositions and structures computationally before experimental synthesis and testing.

While the study focused on 1,3-butadiene, the approach could potentially be extended to other unsaturated hydrocarbons including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. However, additional studies would be needed to verify the correlation for these other molecule classes and to account for potential differences in adsorption geometries or reaction mechanisms.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和1,3-丁二烯吸附能与实验观察到的氢化活性显示良好的相关性。研究发现,1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能都与d带中心很好地相关,在PtCoPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上观察到较弱的结合。这种较弱的结合对应于更高的氢化活性,在PtCo/γ-Al2O3和PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂的实验中也观察到了这一点。

这种结合理论和实验的方法可以通过计算不同Pt-3d表面上各种含C=C键分子的d带中心和结合能来预测氢化活性。预计d带中心距费米能级较远的表面会显示出较弱的吸附剂结合,从而表现出较高的氢化活性。这种方法可以通过允许研究人员在实验合成和测试之前计算筛选潜在的催化剂组成和结构,来指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。

虽然该研究主要针对1,3-丁二烯,但这种方法可能扩展到其他不饱和碳氢化合物,包括线性烯烃、环状碳氢化合物和芳香族化合物。然而,需要进行额外的研究来验证这些其他分子类别的相关性,并考虑吸附几何或反应机理的潜在差异。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations. The study shows a linear correlation between binding energies and d-band center for 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen on various Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. 

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by considering the binding strength of adsorbates. Surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes, such as PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1), display greater hydrogenation activity. This weak interaction allows for novel low-temperature hydrogenation to occur.

The approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by identifying surface structures with optimal binding energies. For example, the study found that PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts showed higher activity than Pt/-Al2O3, which agreed with DFT predictions based on weaker binding of hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene on PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures.

While the study focused on 1,3-butadiene, this approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies and correlating them with d-band centers for various molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces, researchers could predict hydrogenation activity for a wide range of compounds and design catalysts tailored for specific reactions.

DFT计算的表面d带中心和C=C键含有分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的吸附结合能与实验观察结果有很好的相关性。研究显示,在各种Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面上,1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能与d带中心呈线性相关。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过考虑吸附质的结合强度来预测加氢活性。弱结合原子氢和烯烃的表面,如PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1),表现出更高的加氢活性。这种弱相互作用允许新型低温加氢反应的发生。

该方法可以通过识别具有最佳结合能的表面结构来指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。例如,研究发现PtCo/-Al2O3和PtNi/-Al2O3催化剂的活性高于Pt/-Al2O3,这与基于PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构对氢和1,3-丁二烯结合更弱的DFT预测一致。

虽然该研究集中在1,3-丁二烯上,但这种方法可能扩展到其他含C=C键的分子,包括线性烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物。通过计算不同Pt-3d表面上各种分子的结合能并将其与d带中心相关联,研究人员可以预测广泛化合物的加氢活性,并设计针对特定反应的催化剂。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. The calculations show that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate with the d-band center, with weaker binding on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This theoretical prediction aligns with experimental results showing higher hydrogenation activity for PtCo/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

This integrated approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by using the d-band center as a descriptor for binding energies. Surfaces with weaker binding of hydrogen and alkenes are predicted to have greater hydrogenation activity. This method allows for the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by targeting specific d-band center values that correspond to optimal binding energies for desired hydrogenation reactions.

While the study focuses on 1,3-butadiene, the approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies and d-band centers for these molecules on various Pt-3d surfaces, researchers could predict relative hydrogenation activities and guide the development of tailored catalysts for specific reactions.

However, it's important to note that the correlation between theory and experiment may not always be perfect, as demonstrated by the case of PtCu/γ-Al2O3. Additional factors such as surface stability and reorganization under reaction conditions may need to be considered for a more comprehensive predictive model.

DFT计算得出的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和1,3-丁二烯吸附结合能与批量反应器和流动反应器研究的实验观察结果良好相关。计算结果显示，1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能都与d带中心相关，在PtCoPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上结合较弱。这一理论预测与实验结果一致，实验结果显示PtCo/γ-Al2O3和PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂具有较高的氢化活性。

这种综合方法可以通过使用d带中心作为结合能的描述符来预测氢化活性。预测表明，氢和烯烃结合较弱的表面具有更高的氢化活性。这种方法允许通过针对与所需氢化反应的最佳结合能相对应的特定d带中心值来设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。

虽然该研究主要关注1,3-丁二烯，但这种方法可能可以扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香族化合物。通过计算这些分子在各种Pt-3d表面上的结合能和d带中心，研究人员可以预测相对的氢化活性，并指导开发针对特定反应的定制催化剂。

然而，需要注意的是，理论和实验之间的相关性可能并不总是完美的，正如PtCu/γ-Al2O3的例子所示。为了建立更全面的预测模型，可能需要考虑表面稳定性和反应条件下的重组等额外因素。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. The calculations show that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate with the d-band center, with weaker binding on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This correlation successfully predicts higher hydrogenation activity for PtCo and PtNi catalysts, which is verified by experimental results.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces. Surfaces with weaker binding energies are expected to show higher hydrogenation activity. This approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by identifying promising bimetallic combinations and surface structures that optimize the balance between adsorbate binding strength and catalytic activity.

To further develop this approach, additional studies could expand the range of molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) and Pt-3d combinations. Incorporating experimental techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) could provide further validation of the theoretical predictions and offer insights into desorption energies and surface reactions. This comprehensive strategy combining theory and experiment has the potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts show a good correlation with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems in several ways:

1. The d-band center serves as a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, allowing for the prediction of binding energies of adsorbates.

2. Weaker binding energies of both hydrogen and the hydrocarbon (in this case, 1,3-butadiene) correlate with greater hydrogenation activity. This is demonstrated by the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures, which show the weakest binding energies and highest activity.

3. The correlation between d-band center, binding energies, and experimental activity allows for the prediction of catalyst performance. In this study, the theoretical predictions for PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures were verified by both batch and flow reactor results.

4. This approach can be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, to predict their behavior on various Pt-3d catalytic systems.

5. By understanding the relationship between electronic structure (d-band center) and catalytic activity, researchers can design more efficient Pt-3d catalysts by tailoring the electronic properties of the surface to achieve optimal binding strengths for specific reactions.

This integrated approach combining DFT calculations with experimental techniques provides a powerful tool for rational catalyst design, allowing for the prediction and optimization of catalytic performance before extensive experimental testing.
