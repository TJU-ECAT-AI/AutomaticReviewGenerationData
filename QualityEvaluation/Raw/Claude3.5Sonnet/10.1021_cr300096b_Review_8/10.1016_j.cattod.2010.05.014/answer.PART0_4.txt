[1] "DFT calculations are performed in the current study to explore whether such correlation can be extended to conjugated molecules such as 1,3-butadiene."

[2] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces [6]."

[3] "In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."

[4] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]. This weak interaction between the surface and the adsorbate allows for the novel low-temperature hydrogenation to occur."

[5] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts show a good correlation with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems in several ways:

1. The d-band center serves as a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces, allowing for the prediction of binding energies of adsorbates.

2. Weaker binding energies of both hydrogen and the hydrocarbon (in this case, 1,3-butadiene) correlate with greater hydrogenation activity. This is demonstrated by the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures, which show the weakest binding energies and highest activity.

3. The correlation between d-band center, binding energies, and experimental activity allows for the prediction of catalyst performance. In this study, the theoretical predictions for PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures were verified by both batch and flow reactor results.

4. This approach can be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, to predict their behavior on various Pt-3d catalytic systems.

5. By understanding the relationship between electronic structure (d-band center) and catalytic activity, researchers can design more efficient Pt-3d catalysts by tailoring the electronic properties of the surface to achieve optimal binding strengths for specific reactions.

This integrated approach combining DFT calculations with experimental techniques provides a powerful tool for rational catalyst design, allowing for the prediction and optimization of catalytic performance before extensive experimental testing.

Pt-3d催化剂上1,3-丁二烯的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与批量反应器和流动反应器研究的实验观察结果显示出良好的相关性。这种集成的理论和实验方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，具体方式如下：

1. d带中心作为双金属表面电子性质的有用描述符，可用于预测吸附物的结合能。

2. 氢和烃类（在本研究中为1,3-丁二烯）的较弱结合能与更高的氢化活性相关。PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构展示了最弱的结合能和最高的活性，证明了这一点。

3. d带中心、结合能和实验活性之间的相关性允许预测催化剂性能。在本研究中，PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构的理论预测被批量和流动反应器结果所验证。

4. 这种方法可以扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香族化合物，以预测它们在各种Pt-3d催化系统上的行为。

5. 通过理解电子结构（d带中心）和催化活性之间的关系，研究人员可以通过调整表面的电子性质来设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂，以实现特定反应的最佳结合强度。

这种结合DFT计算和实验技术的综合方法为理性催化剂设计提供了强大的工具，允许在进行广泛的实验测试之前预测和优化催化性能。
