[1] "DFT calculations are performed in the current study to explore whether such correlation can be extended to conjugated molecules such as 1,3-butadiene."

[2] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces [6]."

[3] "In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."

[4] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]."

[5] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. The calculations show that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate with the d-band center, with weaker binding on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This theoretical prediction aligns with experimental results showing higher hydrogenation activity for PtCo/γ-Al2O3 and PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

This integrated approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by using the d-band center as a descriptor for binding energies. Surfaces with weaker binding of hydrogen and alkenes are predicted to have greater hydrogenation activity. This method allows for the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by targeting specific d-band center values that correspond to optimal binding energies for desired hydrogenation reactions.

While the study focuses on 1,3-butadiene, the approach could potentially be extended to other C=C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. By calculating binding energies and d-band centers for these molecules on various Pt-3d surfaces, researchers could predict relative hydrogenation activities and guide the development of tailored catalysts for specific reactions.

However, it's important to note that the correlation between theory and experiment may not always be perfect, as demonstrated by the case of PtCu/γ-Al2O3. Additional factors such as surface stability and reorganization under reaction conditions may need to be considered for a more comprehensive predictive model.

DFT计算得出的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和1,3-丁二烯吸附结合能与批量反应器和流动反应器研究的实验观察结果良好相关。计算结果显示，1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能都与d带中心相关，在PtCoPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上结合较弱。这一理论预测与实验结果一致，实验结果显示PtCo/γ-Al2O3和PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂具有较高的氢化活性。

这种综合方法可以通过使用d带中心作为结合能的描述符来预测氢化活性。预测表明，氢和烯烃结合较弱的表面具有更高的氢化活性。这种方法允许通过针对与所需氢化反应的最佳结合能相对应的特定d带中心值来设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。

虽然该研究主要关注1,3-丁二烯，但这种方法可能可以扩展到其他含C=C键的分子，包括线性烯烃、环状烃和芳香族化合物。通过计算这些分子在各种Pt-3d表面上的结合能和d带中心，研究人员可以预测相对的氢化活性，并指导开发针对特定反应的定制催化剂。

然而，需要注意的是，理论和实验之间的相关性可能并不总是完美的，正如PtCu/γ-Al2O3的例子所示。为了建立更全面的预测模型，可能需要考虑表面稳定性和反应条件下的重组等额外因素。
