[1] "DFT calculations are performed in the current study to explore whether such correlation can be extended to conjugated molecules such as 1,3-butadiene."

[2] "Fig. 7 shows the results of DFT calculations of the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and atomic hydrogen on several Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces. The binding energies are plotted versus the surface d-band center, which has been found to be a useful descriptor for the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces"

[3] "In Fig. 7, the binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."

[4] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity"

[5] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for 1,3-butadiene on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from batch and flow reactor studies. The calculations show that binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate with the d-band center, with weaker binding on PtCoPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This correlation successfully predicts higher hydrogenation activity for PtCo and PtNi catalysts, which is verified by experimental results.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating the d-band center and binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces. Surfaces with weaker binding energies are expected to show higher hydrogenation activity. This approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by identifying promising bimetallic combinations and surface structures that optimize the balance between adsorbate binding strength and catalytic activity.

To further develop this approach, additional studies could expand the range of molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) and Pt-3d combinations. Incorporating experimental techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) could provide further validation of the theoretical predictions and offer insights into desorption energies and surface reactions. This comprehensive strategy combining theory and experiment has the potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和1,3-丁二烯吸附结合能与批量反应器和流动反应器研究的实验观察结果良好相关。计算表明，1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能都与d带中心相关，在PtCoPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上结合较弱。这种相关性成功预测了PtCo和PtNi催化剂的较高氢化活性，并得到了实验结果的验证。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过计算不同Pt-3d表面上各种含C=C键分子的d带中心和结合能来预测氢化活性。结合能较弱的表面预计会表现出较高的氢化活性。这种方法可以通过识别有前景的双金属组合和表面结构来指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计，从而优化吸附剂结合强度和催化活性之间的平衡。

为了进一步发展这种方法，可以进行额外的研究来扩大分子范围（包括线性烯烃、环烃和芳香族）和Pt-3d组合。结合程序升温脱附（TPD）等实验技术可以为理论预测提供进一步的验证，并提供关于脱附能和表面反应的见解。这种结合理论和实验的综合策略有潜力加速各种氢化反应的Pt-3d催化剂的发现和优化。
