[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

[2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

[3] "Overall, our results indicate that, at low Ni loadings, the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which in turn lead to different catalytic behavior for both the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene."

The literature does not provide detailed information about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it discuss correlations with TPD measurements. However, the document does mention that DFT modeling reveals modifications to the Pt surface d-band center when alloyed with subsurface 3d transition metals like Ni. It also notes that theoretical and experimental studies show enhanced hydrogenation activity for C=C bonds on PtNi bimetallic surfaces.

To fully answer this question, additional research would be needed to examine specific DFT calculations, TPD measurements, and their correlations for different C=C-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by identifying optimal surface compositions and structures that balance reactant adsorption strength and product desorption. However, the specific details of how to implement this approach are not provided in the given literature.

该文献没有提供关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的详细DFT计算信息,也没有讨论与TPD测量的相关性。然而,该文献确实提到DFT建模揭示了当与亚表面3d过渡金属(如Ni)合金时,Pt表面d带中心会发生修饰。它还指出,理论和实验研究表明PtNi双金属表面对C=C键的氢化活性增强。

要全面回答这个问题,还需要进行额外的研究,以考察Pt-3d催化剂上不同含C=C分子的具体DFT计算、TPD测量及其相关性。这种集成的理论和实验方法可能用于预测氢化活性,并通过识别平衡反应物吸附强度和产物脱附的最佳表面组成和结构,指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。然而,所给文献中并未提供如何实施这种方法的具体细节。
