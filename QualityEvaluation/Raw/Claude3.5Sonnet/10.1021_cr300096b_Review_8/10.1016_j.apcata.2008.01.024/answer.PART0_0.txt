[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

[2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

DFT calculations show that modifying Pt(111) surfaces with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals significantly changes the Pt d-band center. This correlates with experimental observations of increased hydrogenation activity for C=C bonds on PtNiPt(111) structures. While the literature doesn't provide extensive details on TPD measurements or predictions for different C=C-containing molecules, it suggests that integrating DFT calculations of d-band centers with experimental techniques can provide insights into hydrogenation activity. This approach could potentially be extended to study various alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics on different Pt-3d catalysts to predict activity and guide catalyst design. However, more comprehensive studies combining theoretical calculations and experimental measurements for a wider range of molecules and Pt-3d systems would be needed to fully develop this integrated approach for catalyst design.

DFT计算表明,用亚表面Ni和其他3d过渡金属修饰Pt(111)表面会显著改变Pt的d带中心。这与PtNiPt(111)结构上C=C键加氢活性增加的实验观察结果相关。虽然文献没有提供关于TPD测量或不同含C=C分子预测的详细信息,但它表明将d带中心的DFT计算与实验技术相结合可以提供关于加氢活性的见解。这种方法可能会扩展到研究不同Pt-3d催化剂上的各种烯烃、环烃和芳烃,以预测活性并指导催化剂设计。然而,需要对更广泛的分子和Pt-3d系统进行更全面的理论计算和实验测量相结合的研究,才能充分发展这种用于催化剂设计的综合方法。
