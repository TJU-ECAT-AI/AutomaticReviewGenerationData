[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

[2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

DFT calculations show that modifying Pt(111) surfaces with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals significantly changes the Pt d-band center. This correlates with experimental observations of increased hydrogenation activity for C=C bonds on PtNiPt(111) structures. While the literature does not provide detailed information on TPD measurements or predictions for specific molecules, it suggests that integrating DFT calculations of d-band centers with experimental techniques can help predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalysts. Further studies combining theoretical calculations and experimental measurements for a wider range of C=C-containing molecules would be needed to develop more comprehensive predictive models and catalyst design strategies.

DFT计算表明,用亚表面Ni和其他3d过渡金属修饰Pt(111)表面会显著改变Pt的d带中心。这与PtNiPt(111)结构对C=C键增强的氢化活性的实验观察相关。虽然文献没有提供关于TPD测量或特定分子预测的详细信息,但它表明,将d带中心的DFT计算与实验技术相结合可以帮助预测氢化活性,并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化剂的设计。需要进一步研究,结合理论计算和更广泛的C=C含有分子的实验测量,以开发更全面的预测模型和催化剂设计策略。
