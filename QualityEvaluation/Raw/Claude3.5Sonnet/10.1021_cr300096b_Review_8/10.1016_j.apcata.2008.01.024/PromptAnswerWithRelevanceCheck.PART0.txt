How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

[2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

DFT calculations show that modifying Pt(111) surfaces with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals significantly changes the Pt d-band center. This correlates with experimental observations of increased hydrogenation activity for C=C bonds on PtNiPt(111) structures. While the literature doesn't provide extensive details on TPD measurements or predictions for different C=C-containing molecules, it suggests that integrating DFT calculations of d-band centers with experimental techniques can provide insights into hydrogenation activity. This approach could potentially be extended to study various alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics on different Pt-3d catalysts to predict activity and guide catalyst design. However, more comprehensive studies combining theoretical calculations and experimental measurements for a wider range of molecules and Pt-3d systems would be needed to fully develop this integrated approach for catalyst design.

DFT计算表明,用亚表面Ni和其他3d过渡金属修饰Pt(111)表面会显著改变Pt的d带中心。这与PtNiPt(111)结构上C=C键加氢活性增加的实验观察结果相关。虽然文献没有提供关于TPD测量或不同含C=C分子预测的详细信息,但它表明将d带中心的DFT计算与实验技术相结合可以提供关于加氢活性的见解。这种方法可能会扩展到研究不同Pt-3d催化剂上的各种烯烃、环烃和芳烃,以预测活性并指导催化剂设计。然而,需要对更广泛的分子和Pt-3d系统进行更全面的理论计算和实验测量相结合的研究,才能充分发展这种用于催化剂设计的综合方法。

[3] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides some relevant information, but does not fully address the specific question about correlating DFT calculations with experimental TPD measurements for a wide range of C=C bond-containing molecules. However, we can infer that:

1. DFT modeling shows that modifying Pt(111) surfaces with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band center.

2. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the PtNiPt(111) structure is highly active for C=C bond hydrogenation.

3. Disproportionation of cyclohexene has been used as a probe reaction to compare hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts.

To fully address the question, further research would be needed to:

1. Conduct DFT calculations for a wider range of C=C bond-containing molecules on various Pt-3d catalysts.
2. Perform corresponding TPD measurements for these molecules.
3. Correlate the theoretical and experimental results to establish predictive relationships.
4. Use these correlations to design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This integrated approach could potentially lead to more targeted catalyst design and improved hydrogenation efficiency for various industrial applications.

文献提供了一些相关信息，但并未完全回答关于将DFT计算与各种C=C键分子的实验TPD测量相关联的具体问题。然而，我们可以推断：

1. DFT建模表明，用亚表面Ni和其他3d过渡金属修饰Pt(111)表面会显著改变表面Pt d带中心的平均能量。

2. 理论和实验研究都表明，PtNiPt(111)结构对C=C键氢化具有很高的活性。

3. 环己烯的歧化反应被用作探针反应，以比较Pt/Ni双金属表面和催化剂的氢化活性。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进一步研究：

1. 对各种Pt-3d催化剂上的更广泛的C=C键分子进行DFT计算。
2. 对这些分子进行相应的TPD测量。
3. 将理论和实验结果相关联，建立预测关系。
4. 利用这些相关性为特定的氢化反应设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。

这种综合方法可能会导致更有针对性的催化剂设计，并提高各种工业应用的氢化效率。

[3] "Overall, our results indicate that, at low Ni loadings, the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which in turn lead to different catalytic behavior for both the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene."

The literature does not provide detailed information about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it discuss correlations with TPD measurements. However, the document does mention that DFT modeling reveals modifications to the Pt surface d-band center when alloyed with subsurface 3d transition metals like Ni. It also notes that theoretical and experimental studies show enhanced hydrogenation activity for C=C bonds on PtNi bimetallic surfaces.

To fully answer this question, additional research would be needed to examine specific DFT calculations, TPD measurements, and their correlations for different C=C-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by identifying optimal surface compositions and structures that balance reactant adsorption strength and product desorption. However, the specific details of how to implement this approach are not provided in the given literature.

该文献没有提供关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的详细DFT计算信息,也没有讨论与TPD测量的相关性。然而,该文献确实提到DFT建模揭示了当与亚表面3d过渡金属(如Ni)合金时,Pt表面d带中心会发生修饰。它还指出,理论和实验研究表明PtNi双金属表面对C=C键的氢化活性增强。

要全面回答这个问题,还需要进行额外的研究,以考察Pt-3d催化剂上不同含C=C分子的具体DFT计算、TPD测量及其相关性。这种集成的理论和实验方法可能用于预测氢化活性,并通过识别平衡反应物吸附强度和产物脱附的最佳表面组成和结构,指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。然而,所给文献中并未提供如何实施这种方法的具体细节。
