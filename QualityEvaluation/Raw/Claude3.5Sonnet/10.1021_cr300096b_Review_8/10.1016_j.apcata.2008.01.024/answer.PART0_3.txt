[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

[2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

[3] "More recently, it has been demonstrated that the structure of the bimetallic surfaces also plays a significant role in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties"

The literature does not provide detailed information to fully answer the question about correlating DFT calculations with experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT modeling shows subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals can significantly alter the Pt d-band center of Pt(111) surfaces. The text also notes that theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate high activity of PtNiPt(111) structures for C=C bond hydrogenation. This suggests that integrating DFT calculations of d-band centers with experimental techniques like TPD could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation activity and design improved Pt-3d catalysts, but the document does not provide specific details on this integrated approach for different types of C=C containing molecules.

这篇文献没有提供详细信息来全面回答关于将DFT计算与Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的实验观察结果相关联的问题。然而,它确实提到DFT建模表明亚表面Ni和其他3d过渡金属可以显著改变Pt(111)表面的Pt d带中心。文中还指出,理论和实验研究表明PtNiPt(111)结构对C=C键氢化具有高活性。这表明,将d带中心的DFT计算与TPD等实验技术相结合,有可能用于预测氢化活性并设计改进的Pt-3d催化剂,但该文档没有提供这种综合方法对不同类型C=C含键分子的具体细节。
