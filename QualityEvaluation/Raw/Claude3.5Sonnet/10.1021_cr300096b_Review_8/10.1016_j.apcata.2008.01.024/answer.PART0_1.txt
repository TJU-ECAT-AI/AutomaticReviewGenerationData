[1] "Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center)."

[2] "Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds"

[3] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

The literature provides some relevant information, but does not fully address the specific question about correlating DFT calculations with experimental TPD measurements for a wide range of C=C bond-containing molecules. However, we can infer that:

1. DFT modeling shows that modifying Pt(111) surfaces with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band center.

2. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the PtNiPt(111) structure is highly active for C=C bond hydrogenation.

3. Disproportionation of cyclohexene has been used as a probe reaction to compare hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts.

To fully address the question, further research would be needed to:

1. Conduct DFT calculations for a wider range of C=C bond-containing molecules on various Pt-3d catalysts.
2. Perform corresponding TPD measurements for these molecules.
3. Correlate the theoretical and experimental results to establish predictive relationships.
4. Use these correlations to design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for specific hydrogenation reactions.

This integrated approach could potentially lead to more targeted catalyst design and improved hydrogenation efficiency for various industrial applications.

文献提供了一些相关信息，但并未完全回答关于将DFT计算与各种C=C键分子的实验TPD测量相关联的具体问题。然而，我们可以推断：

1. DFT建模表明，用亚表面Ni和其他3d过渡金属修饰Pt(111)表面会显著改变表面Pt d带中心的平均能量。

2. 理论和实验研究都表明，PtNiPt(111)结构对C=C键氢化具有很高的活性。

3. 环己烯的歧化反应被用作探针反应，以比较Pt/Ni双金属表面和催化剂的氢化活性。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进一步研究：

1. 对各种Pt-3d催化剂上的更广泛的C=C键分子进行DFT计算。
2. 对这些分子进行相应的TPD测量。
3. 将理论和实验结果相关联，建立预测关系。
4. 利用这些相关性为特定的氢化反应设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。

这种综合方法可能会导致更有针对性的催化剂设计，并提高各种工业应用的氢化效率。
