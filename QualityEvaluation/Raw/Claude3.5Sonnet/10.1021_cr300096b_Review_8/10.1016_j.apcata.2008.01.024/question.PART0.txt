The effect of impregnation sequence on the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts
Abstract
The effect of impregnation sequence on the formation of Pt/Ni bimetallic nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3 was investigated for catalysts with Pt/Ni atomic ratios of 3/1 and 1/1. These bimetallic catalysts were prepared with a fixed Pt loading (5 wt.%) by incipient impregnation of one metal precursor and calcination, followed by the impregnation of the second metal precursor and a second calcinations step. The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence. The bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts showed significantly higher activity toward the disproportionation of cyclohexene than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/γ-Al2O3. For catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1, the Pt-first catalyst, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, showed higher activity than the Ni-first catalyst, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. The effect of impregnation sequence was not as significant for catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1. In addition, kinetic analysis of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene revealed an increase in the acetylene hydrogenation selectivity for 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 as compared to both 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of the Pt LIII edge indicated that PtNi bimetallic bonds were formed in 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 but not in 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. The PtNi bonds were formed for the 1/1 ratio catalysts with both impregnation sequences. Overall, our results indicate that, at low Ni loadings, the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which in turn lead to different catalytic behavior for both the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene.

The self-hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence in bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts supported on γ-alumina. Our results indicate that, at low Ni loadings, with a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1, the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which in turn lead to different catalytic performance.
1. Introduction
Bimetallic catalysts have proven to be important materials for many catalytic applications
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
and are well known for exhibiting properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts
[2]
,
[5]
. Many investigations combining experimental studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces with reaction pathways

[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
. Some of the probe reactions of the novel activities of the bimetallic catalysts include the disproportionation and hydrogenation of hexene and cyclohexene
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
, the adsorption and decomposition of ethylene
[17]
,
[21]
, the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene
[22]
, and the selective hydrogenation of acrolein toward its corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol)
[23]
, among others.
More recently, it has been demonstrated that the structure of the bimetallic surfaces also plays a significant role in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties
[6]
,
[8]
,
[11]
,
[12]
,
[17]
,
[21]
. For example, our group has shown that for a Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface with a Ni coverage at one monolayer (ML), Ni atoms can reside either on the surface to produce a Ni-terminated NiPt(1 1 1) surface or in the subsurface region to form a Pt-terminated PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure
[12]
. The ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is characterized by unique chemical properties that are distinctively different from Pt(1 1 1), Ni(1 1 1), or the surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structure
[12]
,
[18]
,
[21]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
. In particular, the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure bonds more weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes as compared to NiPtPt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center). Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds
[18]
,
[19]
,
[21]
. Furthermore, this bimetallic structure is thermodynamically stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen
[26]
, while the subsurface Ni atoms segregate to the surface in the presence of adsorbed oxygen
[16]
. The activation barrier for the transformation of the subsurface to surface structures is relatively low, 15 kcal/mol, indicating that the segregation and diffusion of Ni atoms can potentially occur during calcination and reduction procedures and under reaction conditions.
The primary objectives of the current paper are two-fold. The first is to extend surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts. The second objective is to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds. To achieve these objectives, we synthesized bimetallic catalysts with Pt/Ni atomic ratios of 3/1 and 1/1 by sequential impregnation with either Ni-first or Pt-first. The disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene were chosen as probe reactions. The formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond was investigated using EXAFS. Furthermore, the effect of impregnation sequences on the disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene was investigated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) in a batch reactor.
Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1)
[21]
and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1)
[18]
, with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath. In contrast, the disproportionation pathway did not occur on Pt(1 1 1), Ni(1 1 1), or the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface structure under the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence. The second probe reaction is the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene, which is an important industrial process and has been the subject of many studies

[30]

[31]

[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
. Previous studies showed that the formation of bimetallic alloys often modifies the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene, as demonstrated in the systematic investigations over Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu, and Pd-Au supported catalysts
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
. Therefore, the hydrogenation of acetylene should be a useful probe reaction to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the hydrogenation selectivity of supported Pt/Ni catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The γ-Al2O3 support (Alfa Aesar) was used as received. Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) were used as chemical precursors in the synthesis of the bimetallic catalysts. H2 (Keen, grade 5), 10.0% acetylene/helium (Matheson, research grade), ethylene (Matheson, research grade) and CO (Matheson, research grade, 99.99%) were used as received. Cyclohexene (c-C6H10) (Aldrich, 99 + % purity) was purified using several freezepumpthaw cycles before use in the FTIR experiments.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The γ-Al2O3 supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation using the incipient wetness method at two Pt/Ni atomic ratios, 3/1 and 1/1, with the Pt loading being constant at 5 wt.%. The Ni loadings were 1.5 wt.% and 0.5 wt.%, respectively. The incipient wetness point of the dried γ-Al2O3 support was determined to be 0.75 cm3 g1. The Pt and Ni solutions were prepared by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the metal precursor salts. After the impregnation of the first precursor (for Pt or Ni) the catalysts were dried at 383 K for 5 h followed by calcination in air at 563 K for 3 h before impregnating the second precursor (Ni or Pt). The resultant solid mixture was again dried and calcined in air following the aforementioned procedure.
For the remainder of this paper, the bimetallic samples are denoted as 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. The Ni-Pt/γ-Al2O3 nomenclature means that Pt is impregnated first, while Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 means that Ni is impregnated first. The 1Ni-1Pt notation represents 1:1 atomic ratio of Ni and Pt, which corresponds to a loading of 1.5 wt.% and 5 wt.%, respectively; the 1/3Ni-1Pt notation indicates that the atomic ratio of Ni-to-Pt is 1/3, corresponding to a Ni loading of 0.5 wt.%.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The metal dispersion of the catalysts was determined from carbon monoxide (CO) chemisorption experiments using an Altamira Instruments (AMI-200ip). A sample of 0.1 g was loaded into a quartz reactor and reduced in dilute hydrogen (50% H2/He) at 723 K for 1 h. After cooling in He, pulses of CO in a He carrier gas at 20 cm3 min1 were injected at room temperature through a sample loop and the signal was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The CO uptake and metal dispersion were calculated by measuring the decrease in the peak areas caused by adsorption in comparison with the area of a calibrated volume (58 μmol), assuming a stoichiometry of one CO molecule per surface metal atom. The CO uptake and metal dispersion of the bimetallic Pt/Ni samples are shown in
Table 1
. The CO chemisorption results reveal that the dispersion is similar on the four bimetallic catalysts.
Table 1. CO uptake and metal dispersion from CO chemisorption measurements
Sample CO uptake (μmol g1) Dispersion (%)
1Pt/γ-Al2O3 71.9 28.1
1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 86.0 25.2
1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 83.6 24.5
1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 130.0 25.4
1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 122.3 23.9
1Ni/γ-Al2O3 37.0 14.5
The catalyst samples were also characterized by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) using a JEOL 2010f electron microscope operating at 200 kV to determine the metal particle size on the support. The catalyst powders were sonicated in an ethanol solution for about 1 h. Immediately after sonication, two drops of the liquid were transferred onto a Lacey carbon support film on a copper grid. To make sure that the solvent was completely evaporated from the support, the TEM characterization was performed after 48 h of drying.
In order to detect the formation of PtNi bimetallic bond, Pt LIII-edge EXAFS experiments were conducted on the X18B beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. Specimens were prepared by pressing a catalyst powder using hydraulic press (3 ton) to form self-supported pellets to be loaded into an in-house designed catalyst reactor that allowed one to collect X-ray fluorescence and transmission signals simultaneously over an operating temperature range of 150773 K. The samples were heated under a diluted hydrogen flow (5% H2 in He, 40 cc/min) to 723 K with a heating rate of 10 K min1. The catalysts were maintained at this temperature for 1 h and then cooled down under diluted H2 flow. EXAFS data were collected at the LIII edge at room temperature using a double crystal Si(1 1 1) monochromator and ionization chambers. Reference Pt foil was measured in transmission mode simultaneously with all the samples for energy calibration.
The IFFEFIT 1.2.9 data analysis package (Athena, Artemis, Atoms and FEFF6) was used to analyze and fit the EXAFS data
[39]
,
[40]
. The reduction of the raw data was done by fitting the pre-edge region, aligning the individual scans, deglitching the scans in energy range if needed, normalizing to the edge jump, and then averaging to minimize the experimental errors. The AUTOBK algorithm was also used in Athena for background subtraction. Local structural information was obtained using Artemis
[40]
to fit each Pt-edge data set with theoretical standards generated from FEFF6
[41]
in r-space. The PtPt and PtNi contributions to theoretical EXAFS were taken into account for the data fitting. The PtPt FEFF theoretical photoelectron amplitudes and phases were calculated for the bulk Pt fcc structure. The PtNi contribution was calculated theoretically with FEFF6 by replacing Pt with Ni as the first nearest-neighbor shell to Pt in the Pt cluster. The variables in the fit were the coordination numbers of PtNi and PtPt bonds, corrections to their model distances and their disorders (σ2 or DebyeWaller factors). The passive electron reduction factor,
, and the correction to the photoelectron energy origin were determined from the fits to the standard Pt foil EXAFS and fixed in the analysis of the supported catalysts. The total number of variables (7) was much smaller than the total number of the relevant independent data points (17).
2.4. FTIR studies
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the products and reaction kinetics of the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene using a batch reactor system. For all the FTIR experiments, catalyst pellets of 40 mg were pressed onto a rectangular tungsten mesh (2.4 cm × 1 cm, 100 mesh, 0.001 in wire diameter, Alfa Aesar), with spot-welded chromelalumel thermocouple wires to monitor the temperature. The tungsten mesh was supported to a mounting bracket made of Nickel connected at the end of a Z-translator manipulator feedthrough. The feedthrough also possessed connections for resistive heating. The design of this type of cell was based on a model reported elsewhere
[42]
. The stainless steel IR cell, consisting of BaF2 windows, allowed for in situ reduction of samples and spectroscopic measurements of surface species and gas-phase products. Spectra were recorded at room temperature with 4 cm1 spectral resolution by collecting 128 scans for gas phase using a Nicolet-510 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a MCT-A (mercury cadmium telluride) detector. To remove water and other impurities the cell was first evacuated to a pressure below 106 Torr for 60 min. The catalyst was then reduced at 723 K in 30 Torr hydrogen for 30 min followed by evacuation and a high-temperature flash (723 K) to remove any surface species generated during reduction. The reduction cycle was repeated three times before performing the FTIR experiments. The gases and vapors of liquid for reduction, venting, adsorption or hydrogenation reaction were admitted to the IR cell through a gas manifold.
For the disproportionation of cyclohexene, the gas-phase reaction products were monitored by recording gas-phase spectra every 30 s during the reaction. The purity of cyclohexene was verified in situ by comparing the IR spectrum with the standard reference reported in the literature
[43]
. The IR cell was initially filled with 9.8 Torr cyclohexene and gas-phase IR spectra were recorded at room temperature. For data analysis, the concentrations of the three main gas-phase species during the disproportionation reaction, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were estimated using the intensities of their vibrational modes at 1139 cm1 (ωCH2 rock)
[44]
, 1458 cm1 (CH2 deformation)
[45]
, and 1810 cm1 (overtone of the CC stretching mode at 993 cm1)
[46]
, respectively. It is important to point out that the CH2 deformation mode at 1458 cm1 for cyclohexane is convoluted with both the CH2 deformation feature at 1455 cm1 for cyclohexene and the ring stretching and deformation feature at 1488 cm1 for benzene. Therefore, contributions of the latter were subtracted when estimating the concentration of cyclohexane, as described previously
[20]
. These values were then normalized to the weight of catalyst used in the experiment.
Prior to performing the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene, a mixture of 10% acetylene in 90% helium (Matheson) was passed through a dry iceacetone trap for its purification. During the hydrogenation of acetylene, the IR cell was filled with 10 Torr 10% acetylene and 1 Torr ethylene. After the equilibration of the reactant mixture and the formation of a stable baseline, 6 Torr of H2 were introduced to initiate the reaction at room temperature and the IR spectra were recorded. The concentrations of the three main species, acetylene, ethylene, and ethane were determined by the classical least-squares method with a 16-member training set using the BeerLambert law
[47]
for the CH stretching vibrational features between 2600 cm1 and 3500 cm1, as described in detail previously
[22]
.
A parametric fitting method was used for the hydrogenation of both acetylene and ethylene. Equilibrium constants K1, K2, and K3 were defined for the adsorption of acetylene, ethylene and the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen. Also, k1 and k2 were defined as the rate constants for the hydrogenation of acetylene and ethylene, respectively. More details about the kinetic fitting of acetylene hydrogenation in the presence of ethylene have been described previously
[22]
. In brief, a LangmuirHinshelwood classical approximation was used for the elementary reactions that take place for the different reactants on the catalytic system. Rates of hydrogenation for acetylene and ethylene, as well as for the generation of ethane and consumption of hydrogen were used to derive the kinetic equations. The resultant equations were fitted with the experimental data to estimate the different constants
[22]
.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Particle distribution of Ni-Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
Fig. 1
shows the HAADF-STEM pictures of Ni-Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 samples for Pt/Ni atomic ratios of 1/1 and 3/1. The samples were reduced in H2 in the FTIR cell, although they were subsequently exposed to air during the sample preparation for TEM measurements. Since in the HAADF images the contrast arises due to difference in atomic number of the elements of interest (single heavy atoms on low-Z substrates)
[48]
, the bright dots are most likely due to Pt and Ni particles distinguished from the low atomic number of the support (γ-Al2O3). The TEM images reveal a relatively uniform distribution of the metal particles (bright spots), with metal particle size in the range of 23 nm, for all four catalysts. The similar particle size distributions are consistent with the similar dispersion values (
Table 1
) for the four Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts.

Visual examination of the Pt LIII-edge XANES and EXAFS allows one to make the following preliminary conclusions about the state of reduction in each sample
[49]
. There is evidence of PtO and PtM (M = Pt and Ni) peaks in r-space in the Pt LIII-edge EXAFS (
Fig. 2
c and d) before reduction. The peak at low radial distribution, characteristic of PtO, in the unreduced sample is no longer present after reduction with hydrogen (
Fig. 2
c and d). These observations are consistent with the XANES results (
Fig. 2
a and b), which show that the white line intensity decreased toward that of Pt foil after the H2 reduction.

theory in r-space for 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3, 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3. The best fit results are summarized in
Table 2
. The EXAFS spectra were analyzed by assuming two contributions, PtPt and PtNi. From the r-space, as explained above, PtO bonds do not contribute significantly in the reduced catalysts, and thus their theoretical contributions were not included in the model. For samples at a Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1, the calculated values for the total PtM coordination numbers indicate that the average diameter of the nanoparticles in both cases can be estimated as ca. 3 nm, assuming a hemispherical cuboctahedral fcc structure
[50]
. In addition, a small coordination of PtNi is observed on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 while no PtNi bonds were found on the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 sample. On contrary, the results for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 samples confirmed the formation of PtNi bonds in both impregnation sequences. For example, for the 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 sample, the PtNi bond length was found to be 2.57(4) Å, which is 0.07(4) Å longer than the NiNi bond in metallic Ni (2.49 Å) and 0.21(4) Å shorter than the PtPt bond in metallic Pt (2.78 Å). The PtPt bond length is 2.74(1) Å, which is 0.03(1) Å shorter than in metallic Pt (2.78 Å). Both of these results suggest that Pt and Ni are in the alloy form. Furthermore, a good fit to the Pt LIII-edge data can only be obtained when both PtPt and PtNi contributions are included in the model, suggesting that the nanoparticles have both Pt and Ni.

σ2 (PtNi) (Å2) 0.013  0.0066  0.0141  0.0036 0.022  0.009
In all four samples the ratio of the coordination numbers of PtPt and PtNi is greater than the atomic ratios of Pt/Ni. For example, in the two (1/1) catalysts the coordination number of PtPt is greater than that of PtNi, suggesting that the remaining Ni atoms are in the monometallic Ni phases either in particles or in dispersed form on the Al2O3 surface. Due to the relatively low loadings of Ni in these samples, the quality of the EXAFS spectra of the Ni K-edge was not sufficient for EXAFS analysis in the current study.
3.3. Activity of disproportionation of cyclohexene
Fig. 4
a shows the rates of cyclohexene consumption, in units of number of molecules per mg of catalyst over the various Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts and the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the disproportionation of cyclohexene.
Fig. 4
b and c displays the reaction products from the disproportionation, cyclohexane and benzene, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 4
a, for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the conversion of cyclohexene reached 100% after 60 min. In contrast, the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts showed significantly lower rates for the conversion of cyclohexene. The conversion of cyclohexene on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was significantly faster than the one on 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. In order to obtain a more quantitative comparison, the conversion rate of cyclohexene on all the catalysts was approximated by fitting the experimental results with first-order kinetics. These rate constants are listed in
Table 3
. The rate constants for cyclohexene conversion over the six catalysts followed the order of 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 1Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3  1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst clearly showed a higher disproportionation rate than 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. This can be explained by the presence of the PtNi bimetallic alloy when Pt was impregnated first, as confirmed by the detection of the PtNi bond from the EXAFS measurements. On the contrary, similar disproportionation rates were observed on both 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, which means that the bimetallic effect on these Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts does not depend strongly on the sequence in the impregnation of the metal precursors at the Ni metal loading used in these catalysts (1.5 wt.% Ni). Again this is consistent with the EXAFS results, where the presence of the PtNi bonds is observed in both catalysts.

On the 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the acetylene concentration decreased during the reaction while ethane concentration increased until all the acetylene and ethylene were consumed. Due to presence of excess H2, the final product of all reactions was ethane. In contrast, the reaction over 1Ni/γ-Al2O3 showed significantly lower hydrogenation activity, as shown in
Fig. 5
. It is apparent that different trends are observed over the different catalysts in the concentration profiles of acetylene, ethylene, and ethane. For example, the ethylene concentration went up noticeably for 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 while it decreased or remained practically constant for 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts from the very beginning of the reaction.

As shown in

, on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the equilibrium constant for acetylene adsorption (K1) is larger than that on 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, while the equilibrium constant for ethylene adsorption (K2) is smaller than on the other catalysts. Therefore, the increase in the selectivity to acetylene hydrogenation on 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 is mainly due to the increase in the relative ratio of K1/K2, which means alloying Pt with Ni can help adsorb more acetylene and less ethylene and thus lead to the enhancement of acetylene hydrogenation selectivity. The comparison indicates that hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene depends on the order at which the metal precursors are impregnated on the support.
3.5. Effect of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic PtNi bonds
In the case of the two 1/1 ratio catalysts, there is no significant difference between them in the overall activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the estimated rate constants. Although the EXAFS analysis shows differences in the coordination number of the PtNi bonds, the fact that PtPt and PtNi distances are very similar within the error bars implies that bimetallic bonds are formed on both catalysts. As mentioned in the introduction, the Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are much more active than Ni-terminated ones for the disproportionation cyclohexene
[18]
. Therefore, the observation of similar disproportionation activities of the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 suggests that the surfaces of both catalysts are likely terminated by Pt after the calcination and reduction cycles. The segregation of Pt atoms to the surface is consistent with previous studies on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, where the segregation of Pt is thermodynamically favored under ultra-high vacuum conditions and in the presence of atomic hydrogen
[16]
. Lastly, a similar finding has been reported for Ni/Pt catalysts supported on alumina for the reforming of methane. The authors concluded that the sequential impregnation of previously reduced Ni catalysts with Pt shows Pt atoms located preferentially on the surface of the PtNi alloy
[55]
.
In comparison, the physical and chemical probes described above demonstrate that the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is much less for the catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). With a Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1 (0.5 wt.% Ni), the formation of the PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles is evident when Pt is impregnated first on the alumina support, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, as confirmed by the detection of the PtNi coordination in EXAFS (See
Table 2
). In contrast, there is no evidence of bimetallic bond formation when the Ni precursor is impregnated first, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. In addition, the disproportionation of cyclohexene on 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 shows a higher conversion rate than either 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3. Finally, the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst also shows a higher selectivity for the hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene than either 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3. All of these results suggest the lack of the formation of the bimetallic PtNi bonds on the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. This could be due to the formation of Ni aluminate (NiAl2O4) species when Ni is impregnated first on the alumina support, due to the strong interaction of Ni with γ-Al2O3 as reported previously
[51]
,
[52]
. According to Morikawa et al.
[53]
and Salagre et al.
[54]
, Ni in NiAl2O4 is reducible only at temperatures above 873 K, which is higher than the reduction temperature of 723 K in the current study. In comparison, for a higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.%) with a Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1 (5 wt.% Pt), bimetallic PtNi bonds are detected regardless of the impregnation sequence, suggesting that there is a threshold of Ni loading for the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds. It is most likely that an initial threshold coverage of Ni interacts strongly with the support, producing either NiO or NiAl2O4 that prevents the reduction of Ni and therefore the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds. When Pt is impregnated first, the strong interaction of Ni with the support seems to be reduced by the Pt precursor or the actual Pt oxide formed during the calcination step. This could explain the fact that the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows the presence of the PtNi bonds, and correspondingly an enhanced selectivity in the hydrogenation of acetylene and a higher disproportionation activity of cyclohexene than 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.
Another explanation for the effect of impregnation sequence is the possible diffusion of Ni2+ ion into the tetrahedral and octahedral cavities of the γ-Al2O3 support. The ability of transition metal ions to enter the γ-Al2O3 lattice cavities should depend on the size of the ions. As reported by Yan et al.
[56]
,
[57]
, small ions such as Ni2+ or Co2+ with a radius of 0.69 Å are well known to enter the γ-Al2O3 matrix relatively easily, but the larger Pt2+ ion with a radius of 0.80 Å is unable to do so under the same conditions. The same argument could be applied in the current study. When the Ni2+ ion is impregnated first, all or a large fraction would enter the γ-Al2O3 cavities. On the contrary, if the Pt2+ is deposited first, it would remain outside the matrix and likely prevent subsequently deposited Ni2+ ion from entering the γ-Al2O3 cavities. The availability of both Ni and Pt outside the cavities would in turn facilitate the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds, consistent with the results in the current study.
Overall, results from the reactors studies suggested that the catalytic properties of 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were also modified as compared to the monometallic catalysts. This is indicated by the increase in the rate constant for cyclohexene conversion (
Table 3
) and in the equilibrium constant for acetylene adsorption (
Table 4
). Even though the modifications in these constants are less than those of the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, they nevertheless suggested that at least a fraction of the Pt and Ni atoms formed bimetallic bonds. Although the EXAFS analysis did not detect the NiPt bonds in the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, this could be partially due to the sensitivity limit of EXAFS for the low loading of Ni.
4. Conclusions
From the results and discussion presented above, the following conclusions can be made regarding the effect of impregnation sequence on the physical and chemical properties of supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts:
The impregnation sequence of Pt and Ni has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the γ-Al2O3 support for a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1 (5 wt.% Pt, 0.5 wt.% Ni). When Pt is impregnated first, a significantly higher activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and a higher selectivity for the acetylene hydrogenation were found when compared with the one where Ni is impregnated first, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. EXAFS measurements and data analysis show the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the former but not on the latter catalyst. One possible explanation of the effect of impregnation sequence is the diffusion of Ni into the cavities of the γ-Al2O3 support when the Ni2+ ion is deposited first.
For a higher Ni loading at the same Pt loading (1.5 wt.% Ni) in the bimetallic catalysts, the sequence of the impregnation does not seem to play a significant role in the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene. EXAFS studies reveal the formation of PtNi bonds in both catalysts. The observation of similar disproportionation activities suggests that the surfaces of both are Pt-terminated, from the segregation of Pt to the surface during hydrogen reduction that has been predicted from DFT modeling verified experimentally in previous studies on single crystal Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces
[16]
.
Overall, the batch reactor results demonstrate that the bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity and selectivity than the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. The promoting effect due to bimetallic formation is consistent with previous studies on the corresponding single crystal surfaces, demonstrating a correlation of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt/Ni(1 1 1) model surfaces with supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.
