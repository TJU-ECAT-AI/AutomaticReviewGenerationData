[1] "Novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity is observed over the PtNiPt(1 1 1) configuration and is attributed to the fact that the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(1 1 1) and monometallic surfaces"

[2] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."

[3] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

The literature does not provide detailed information on DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it discuss correlations with experimental TPD measurements. However, the text does mention that DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies on bimetallic surfaces, which in turn affects catalytic activity. 

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Calculating surface d-band centers for different Pt-3d bimetallic configurations using DFT.
2. Correlating these calculations with experimental binding energy measurements for various C=C containing molecules.
3. Relating binding energies to observed hydrogenation activity in experiments.
4. Using these relationships to predict activity of new Pt-3d catalyst compositions.

This approach could inform catalyst design by allowing researchers to computationally screen many Pt-3d combinations before synthesizing promising candidates for experimental testing. It could help identify bimetallic configurations that provide optimal binding strengths for target molecules, potentially leading to more efficient hydrogenation catalysts.

文献并未提供关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算的详细信息，也没有讨论与实验TPD测量的相关性。然而，文本确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心与双金属表面上的吸附物结合能相关，这反过来又影响催化活性。

这种综合理论和实验方法可能用于预测氢化活性的方式如下：

1. 使用DFT计算不同Pt-3d双金属构型的表面d带中心。
2. 将这些计算结果与各种含C=C分子的实验结合能测量相关联。
3. 将结合能与实验中观察到的氢化活性联系起来。
4. 利用这些关系来预测新的Pt-3d催化剂组成的活性。

这种方法可以通过允许研究人员在合成有前景的候选物进行实验测试之前计算筛选许多Pt-3d组合来指导催化剂设计。它可以帮助识别为目标分子提供最佳结合强度的双金属构型，从而可能导致更高效的氢化催化剂。
