[1] "Novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity is observed over the PtNiPt(1 1 1) configuration and is attributed to the fact that the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(1 1 1) and monometallic surfaces"

[2] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT). This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

[3] "Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, which should in turn lead to differences in hydrogenation activity"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention some relevant concepts that can be used to partially address the question.

The document indicates that there is a correlation between the surface d-band center (calculated by DFT) and the binding energies of adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces. This electronic modification due to bimetallic formation affects the binding strength of adsorbates, which in turn influences catalytic activity.

Specifically for 1,3-butadiene, the binding energy is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, leading to differences in hydrogenation activity. The PtNiPt(111) surface configuration shows novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity, which is attributed to weaker binding of atomic hydrogen and alkenes compared to NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces.

While the document does not explicitly discuss TPD measurements or provide a comprehensive list of C=C bond-containing molecules, it suggests that an integrated theoretical (DFT) and experimental approach can be used to understand and predict hydrogenation activity. This approach could potentially be extended to inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by tailoring the electronic properties of the catalyst surface to achieve desired binding strengths and catalytic activities for specific molecules.

文献没有为特定问题提供全面的答案,即关于在Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算。然而,它确实提到了一些可用于部分回答该问题的相关概念。

文档指出,表面d带中心(通过DFT计算)与双金属表面上吸附物的结合能之间存在相关性。由于双金属形成而产生的这种电子修饰影响了吸附物的结合强度,进而影响催化活性。

具体对于1,3-丁二烯,其结合能与双金属表面的d带中心值相关,导致氢化活性的差异。PtNiPt(111)表面构型显示出新颖的低温氢化活性,这归因于与NiPtPt(111)和单金属表面相比,原子氢和烯烃的结合更弱。

虽然文档没有明确讨论TPD测量或提供含C=C键分子的综合列表,但它表明可以使用集成的理论(DFT)和实验方法来理解和预测氢化活性。这种方法可能会扩展到指导更高效Pt-3d催化系统的设计,通过调整催化剂表面的电子性质来实现特定分子所需的结合强度和催化活性。
