[1] "Novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity is observed over the PtNiPt(1 1 1) configuration and is attributed to the fact that the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(1 1 1) and monometallic surfaces"

[2] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."

[3] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison between DFT calculations and experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies, which in turn affect catalytic activity. 

The document notes that the PtNiPt(111) surface binds hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces, leading to novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity. This suggests that DFT calculations of d-band center positions could be used to predict relative binding strengths and hydrogenation activity for different Pt-3d catalytic systems.

To fully utilize this integrated theoretical and experimental approach for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalysts, researchers would need to:

1. Perform DFT calculations of d-band centers for various Pt-3d surface configurations
2. Calculate binding energies for different C=C bond-containing molecules on these surfaces
3. Conduct experimental measurements like TPD for the same molecules and surfaces
4. Correlate the theoretical predictions with experimental results
5. Use the established correlations to predict activity for new Pt-3d catalyst designs

This approach could potentially allow for more rapid screening and development of improved Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions involving various alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatic compounds.

文献并未提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的DFT计算与实验观察之间的全面比较。然而,它确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心与吸附质结合能相关,进而影响催化活性。

文档指出,PtNiPt(111)表面对氢和烯烃的结合比NiPtPt(111)和单金属表面更弱,导致新颖的低温氢化活性。这表明d带中心位置的DFT计算可用于预测不同Pt-3d催化系统的相对结合强度和氢化活性。

为了充分利用这种集成的理论和实验方法来预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂,研究人员需要:

1. 对各种Pt-3d表面构型进行d带中心的DFT计算
2. 计算不同C=C键含分子在这些表面上的结合能
3. 对相同的分子和表面进行TPD等实验测量
4. 将理论预测与实验结果相关联
5. 利用建立的相关性来预测新Pt-3d催化剂设计的活性

这种方法可能允许更快速地筛选和开发改进的Pt-3d催化剂,用于涉及各种烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物的氢化反应。
