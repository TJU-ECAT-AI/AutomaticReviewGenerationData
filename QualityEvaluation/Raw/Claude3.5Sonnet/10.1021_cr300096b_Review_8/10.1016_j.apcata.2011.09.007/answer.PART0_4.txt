[1] "Novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity is observed over the PtNiPt(1 1 1) configuration and is attributed to the fact that the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(1 1 1) and monometallic surfaces"

[2] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."

[3] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to this specific question about correlating DFT calculations with experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention some relevant concepts:

The binding energies of adsorbates on Pt-Ni bimetallic surfaces correlate with the location of the surface d-band center, as calculated by DFT. This electronic modification due to bimetallic formation affects adsorbate binding strength and catalytic activity. Specifically, the PtNiPt(111) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces, leading to novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity.

To fully answer the question, additional studies would be needed to:
1. Perform DFT calculations of d-band centers and binding energies for various C=C molecules on Pt-3d catalysts.
2. Conduct experimental TPD measurements for these molecules.
3. Correlate the theoretical and experimental results.
4. Use this integrated approach to predict hydrogenation activity and design improved Pt-3d catalysts.

This type of comprehensive theoretical-experimental study could provide valuable insights for rational catalyst design, but is beyond the scope of the information provided in this specific literature.

文献并未对这个具体问题提供全面的答案,即关于在Pt-3d催化剂上对各种含C=C键分子的DFT计算与实验观察的相关性。但是,它确实提到了一些相关概念:

吸附质在Pt-Ni双金属表面上的结合能与通过DFT计算的表面d带中心位置相关。由于双金属形成而产生的这种电子修饰影响了吸附质的结合强度和催化活性。具体来说,PtNiPt(111)表面与原子氢和烯烃的结合比NiPtPt(111)和单金属表面更弱,导致了新颖的低温氢化活性。

要完整回答这个问题,需要进行额外的研究:
1. 对Pt-3d催化剂上各种C=C分子进行d带中心和结合能的DFT计算。
2. 对这些分子进行实验TPD测量。
3. 将理论和实验结果进行关联。
4. 使用这种综合理论-实验方法来预测氢化活性并设计改进的Pt-3d催化剂。

这种全面的理论-实验研究可能为理性催化剂设计提供宝贵的见解,但超出了本文献所提供信息的范围。
