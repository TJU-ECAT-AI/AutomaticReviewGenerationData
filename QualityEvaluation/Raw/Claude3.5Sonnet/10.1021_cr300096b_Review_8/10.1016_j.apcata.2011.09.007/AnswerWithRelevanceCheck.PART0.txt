          [1] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."

[2] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

[3] "Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, which should in turn lead to differences in hydrogenation activity"

[4] "Novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity is observed over the PtNiPt(1 1 1) configuration and is attributed to the fact that the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(1 1 1) and monometallic surfaces"

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts and their correlation with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it does mention some relevant concepts:

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies on bimetallic surfaces.
2. The electronic modification due to bimetallic formation affects the binding strength of adsorbates and, consequently, catalytic activity.
3. The binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, leading to differences in hydrogenation activity.
4. PtNiPt(111) surface configuration shows novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity due to weaker binding of atomic hydrogen and alkenes compared to NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces.

To fully utilize this integrated theoretical and experimental approach for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalysts, researchers would need to:

1. Perform DFT calculations of d-band centers for various Pt-3d surface configurations
2. Calculate binding energies for different C=C bond-containing molecules on these surfaces
3. Conduct experimental measurements like TPD for the same molecules and surfaces
4. Correlate the theoretical predictions with experimental results
5. Use the established correlations to predict activity for new Pt-3d catalyst designs

This approach could potentially allow for more rapid screening and development of improved Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions involving various alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatic compounds.

          文献并未提供关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算及其与TPD等实验技术观察结果相关性的全面回答。然而，它确实提到了一些相关概念：

1. DFT计算的表面d带中心与双金属表面上的吸附物结合能相关。
2. 由于双金属形成而产生的电子修饰影响了吸附物的结合强度，进而影响催化活性。
3. 1,3-丁二烯的结合能与双金属表面的d带中心值相关，导致氢化活性的差异。
4. PtNiPt(111)表面构型显示出新颖的低温氢化活性，这是由于与NiPtPt(111)和单金属表面相比，原子氢和烯烃的结合更弱。

为了充分利用这种集成的理论和实验方法来预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂，研究人员需要：

1. 对各种Pt-3d表面构型进行d带中心的DFT计算
2. 计算不同C=C键含分子在这些表面上的结合能
3. 对相同的分子和表面进行TPD等实验测量
4. 将理论预测与实验结果相关联
5. 利用建立的相关性来预测新Pt-3d催化剂设计的活性

这种方法可能允许更快速地筛选和开发改进的Pt-3d催化剂，用于涉及各种烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物的氢化反应。
