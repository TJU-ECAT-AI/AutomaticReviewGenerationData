[1] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."

[2] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

[3] "Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, which should in turn lead to differences in hydrogenation activity on PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 as compared to the other three bimetallic catalysts."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of DFT calculations and experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies, which in turn affect catalytic activity. The document specifically notes that the binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, leading to differences in hydrogenation activity.

To fully answer the question, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach would need to be developed. This would involve:

1. Performing DFT calculations to determine surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d catalytic surfaces.

2. Conducting experimental studies such as Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) measurements for the same molecules and catalytic surfaces.

3. Comparing the theoretical predictions with experimental results to validate the correlation between d-band center, binding energies, and catalytic activity.

4. Using the validated correlations to predict hydrogenation activity for new Pt-3d catalyst compositions.

5. Iteratively designing and testing new catalytic systems based on these predictions to optimize hydrogenation activity.

This approach could potentially lead to the development of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions, by allowing researchers to screen potential catalyst compositions computationally before experimental testing.

文献没有提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的DFT计算和实验观察的全面比较。然而,它确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心与吸附质结合能相关,进而影响催化活性。文档特别指出,1,3-丁二烯的结合能与双金属表面的d带中心值相关,导致氢化活性的差异。

为了全面回答这个问题,需要开发一种综合的理论和实验方法。这将涉及:

1. 对不同Pt-3d催化表面上各种含C=C键分子进行DFT计算,以确定表面d带中心和吸附质结合能。

2. 对相同的分子和催化表面进行实验研究,如程序升温脱附(TPD)测量。

3. 将理论预测与实验结果进行比较,以验证d带中心、结合能和催化活性之间的相关性。

4. 使用验证过的相关性来预测新的Pt-3d催化剂组成的氢化活性。

5. 基于这些预测反复设计和测试新的催化系统,以优化氢化活性。

这种方法可能会通过允许研究人员在实验测试之前计算地筛选潜在的催化剂组成,从而潜在地导致开发出更高效的用于氢化反应的Pt-3d催化系统。
