[1] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."

[2] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."

[3] "Previous studies have demonstrated that the binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, which should in turn lead to differences in hydrogenation activity on PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 as compared to the other three bimetallic catalysts."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of DFT calculations and experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies, which in turn affect catalytic activity. The document specifically notes that the binding energy of 1,3-butadiene is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, leading to differences in hydrogenation activity.

To fully answer the question, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach would need to be developed. This would involve:

1. Performing DFT calculations to determine surface d-band centers and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d catalytic surfaces.

2. Conducting experimental studies such as Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) measurements for the same molecules and catalytic surfaces.

3. Comparing the theoretical predictions with experimental results to validate the correlation between d-band center, binding energies, and catalytic activity.

4. Using the validated correlations to predict hydrogenation activity for new Pt-3d catalyst compositions.

5. Iteratively designing and testing new catalytic systems based on these predictions to optimize hydrogenation activity.

This approach could potentially lead to the development of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems for hydrogenation reactions, by allowing researchers to screen potential catalyst compositions computationally before experimental testing.

文献没有提供Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的DFT计算和实验观察的全面比较。然而,它确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心与吸附质结合能相关,进而影响催化活性。文档特别指出,1,3-丁二烯的结合能与双金属表面的d带中心值相关,导致氢化活性的差异。

为了全面回答这个问题,需要开发一种综合的理论和实验方法。这将涉及:

1. 对不同Pt-3d催化表面上各种含C=C键分子进行DFT计算,以确定表面d带中心和吸附质结合能。

2. 对相同的分子和催化表面进行实验研究,如程序升温脱附(TPD)测量。

3. 将理论预测与实验结果进行比较,以验证d带中心、结合能和催化活性之间的相关性。

4. 使用验证过的相关性来预测新的Pt-3d催化剂组成的氢化活性。

5. 基于这些预测反复设计和测试新的催化系统,以优化氢化活性。

这种方法可能会通过允许研究人员在实验测试之前计算地筛选潜在的催化剂组成,从而潜在地导致开发出更高效的用于氢化反应的Pt-3d催化系统。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison between DFT calculations and experimental observations for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention that DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies, which in turn affect catalytic activity. 

The document notes that the PtNiPt(111) surface binds hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces, leading to novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity. This suggests that DFT calculations of d-band center positions could be used to predict relative binding strengths and hydrogenation activity for different Pt-3d catalytic systems.

To fully utilize this integrated theoretical and experimental approach for predicting hydrogenation activity and designing more efficient Pt-3d catalysts, researchers would need to:

1. Perform DFT calculations of d-band centers for various Pt-3d surface configurations
2. Calculate binding energies for different C=C bond-containing molecules on these surfaces
3. Conduct experimental measurements like TPD for the same molecules and surfaces
4. Correlate the theoretical predictions with experimental results
5. Use the established correlations to predict activity for new Pt-3d catalyst designs

This approach could potentially allow for more rapid screening and development of improved Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions involving various alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatic compounds.

文档指出,PtNiPt(111)表面对氢和烯烃的结合比NiPtPt(111)和单金属表面更弱,导致新颖的低温氢化活性。这表明d带中心位置的DFT计算可用于预测不同Pt-3d催化系统的相对结合强度和氢化活性。

为了充分利用这种集成的理论和实验方法来预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂,研究人员需要:

1. 对各种Pt-3d表面构型进行d带中心的DFT计算
2. 计算不同C=C键含分子在这些表面上的结合能
3. 对相同的分子和表面进行TPD等实验测量
4. 将理论预测与实验结果相关联
5. 利用建立的相关性来预测新Pt-3d催化剂设计的活性

这种方法可能允许更快速地筛选和开发改进的Pt-3d催化剂,用于涉及各种烯烃、环烃和芳香族化合物的氢化反应。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. However, it does mention some relevant concepts that can be used to partially address the question.

The document indicates that there is a correlation between the surface d-band center (calculated by DFT) and the binding energies of adsorbates on bimetallic surfaces. This electronic modification due to bimetallic formation affects the binding strength of adsorbates, which in turn influences catalytic activity.

Specifically for 1,3-butadiene, the binding energy is related to the d-band center value of bimetallic surfaces, leading to differences in hydrogenation activity. The PtNiPt(111) surface configuration shows novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity, which is attributed to weaker binding of atomic hydrogen and alkenes compared to NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces.

While the document does not explicitly discuss TPD measurements or provide a comprehensive list of C=C bond-containing molecules, it suggests that an integrated theoretical (DFT) and experimental approach can be used to understand and predict hydrogenation activity. This approach could potentially be extended to inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by tailoring the electronic properties of the catalyst surface to achieve desired binding strengths and catalytic activities for specific molecules.

文献没有为特定问题提供全面的答案,即关于在Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算。然而,它确实提到了一些可用于部分回答该问题的相关概念。

文档指出,表面d带中心(通过DFT计算)与双金属表面上吸附物的结合能之间存在相关性。由于双金属形成而产生的这种电子修饰影响了吸附物的结合强度,进而影响催化活性。

具体对于1,3-丁二烯,其结合能与双金属表面的d带中心值相关,导致氢化活性的差异。PtNiPt(111)表面构型显示出新颖的低温氢化活性,这归因于与NiPtPt(111)和单金属表面相比,原子氢和烯烃的结合更弱。

虽然文档没有明确讨论TPD测量或提供含C=C键分子的综合列表,但它表明可以使用集成的理论(DFT)和实验方法来理解和预测氢化活性。这种方法可能会扩展到指导更高效Pt-3d催化系统的设计,通过调整催化剂表面的电子性质来实现特定分子所需的结合强度和催化活性。

The literature does not provide detailed information on DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, nor does it discuss correlations with experimental TPD measurements. However, the text does mention that DFT calculations of surface d-band center correlate with adsorbate binding energies on bimetallic surfaces, which in turn affects catalytic activity. 

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach could potentially be used to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Calculating surface d-band centers for different Pt-3d bimetallic configurations using DFT.
2. Correlating these calculations with experimental binding energy measurements for various C=C containing molecules.
3. Relating binding energies to observed hydrogenation activity in experiments.
4. Using these relationships to predict activity of new Pt-3d catalyst compositions.

This approach could inform catalyst design by allowing researchers to computationally screen many Pt-3d combinations before synthesizing promising candidates for experimental testing. It could help identify bimetallic configurations that provide optimal binding strengths for target molecules, potentially leading to more efficient hydrogenation catalysts.

文献并未提供关于Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算的详细信息，也没有讨论与实验TPD测量的相关性。然而，文本确实提到DFT计算的表面d带中心与双金属表面上的吸附物结合能相关，这反过来又影响催化活性。

这种综合理论和实验方法可能用于预测氢化活性的方式如下：

1. 使用DFT计算不同Pt-3d双金属构型的表面d带中心。
2. 将这些计算结果与各种含C=C分子的实验结合能测量相关联。
3. 将结合能与实验中观察到的氢化活性联系起来。
4. 利用这些关系来预测新的Pt-3d催化剂组成的活性。

这种方法可以通过允许研究人员在合成有前景的候选物进行实验测试之前计算筛选许多Pt-3d组合来指导催化剂设计。它可以帮助识别为目标分子提供最佳结合强度的双金属构型，从而可能导致更高效的氢化催化剂。

Specifically, the PtNiPt(111) surface binds atomic hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than NiPtPt(111) and monometallic surfaces, leading to novel low-temperature hydrogenation activity.

2. Conduct experimental TPD measurements for these molecules.
3. Correlate the theoretical and experimental results.
4. Use this integrated approach to predict hydrogenation activity and design improved Pt-3d catalysts.

This type of comprehensive theoretical-experimental study could provide valuable insights for rational catalyst design, but is beyond the scope of the information provided in this specific literature.
