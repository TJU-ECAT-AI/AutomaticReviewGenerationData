How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

The given literature does not contain any information about DFT calculations, surface d-band centers, or adsorbate binding energies for C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. The document focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported platinum catalysts with tin and indium promoters. It does not discuss the correlation between theoretical calculations and experimental techniques like TPD for predicting hydrogenation activity. The literature provided does not contain relevant information to answer this specific question about integrating DFT and experimental approaches for Pt-3d catalytic systems.
