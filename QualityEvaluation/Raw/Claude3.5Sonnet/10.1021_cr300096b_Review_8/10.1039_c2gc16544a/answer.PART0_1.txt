[1] "According to DFT calculations, these Pt-terminated surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation."

[2] "Previous studies have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts facilitate the hydrogenation activity in 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene reactions compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "These results are consistent with surface science studies and DFT calculations that correlate binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons with hydrogenation activity. For example, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic surfaces are found to have optimal alkene binding energies, leading to higher hydrogenation activities than the monometallic Pt surface."

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations. The calculations show that Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, resulting in optimized binding energies. This theoretical prediction aligns with experimental findings that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity for molecules like 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by:

1. Using DFT to calculate binding energies of various C=C bond-containing molecules on different Pt-3d surfaces.
2. Correlating these calculated binding energies with experimental hydrogenation rates obtained from techniques like TPD measurements.
3. Identifying optimal binding energy ranges that correspond to enhanced hydrogenation activity.

This approach can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by:

1. Screening potential Pt-3d combinations to identify those with optimal binding energies for target molecules.
2. Predicting which bimetallic compositions are likely to exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity.
3. Guiding the synthesis of new catalysts with tailored electronic properties for specific hydrogenation reactions.

By combining theoretical predictions with experimental validation, researchers can more efficiently develop improved Pt-3d catalysts for various hydrogenation applications.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂表面d带中心和含C=C键分子的吸附结合能与实验观察结果有很好的相关性。计算表明，Pt-3d双金属表面与氢和碳氢化合物吸附物的结合比单金属Pt表面更弱，从而产生优化的结合能。这一理论预测与实验结果一致，即PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂对1,3-丁二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯等分子的加氢活性比单金属Pt催化剂更高。

这种综合理论和实验的方法可以通过以下方式用于预测加氢活性：

1. 使用DFT计算不同Pt-3d表面上各种含C=C键分子的结合能。
2. 将这些计算得到的结合能与从TPD等测量技术获得的实验加氢速率相关联。
3. 确定与增强加氢活性相对应的最佳结合能范围。

这种方法可以通过以下方式指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统：

1. 筛选潜在的Pt-3d组合，以确定对目标分子具有最佳结合能的组合。
2. 预测哪些双金属组成可能表现出增强的加氢活性。
3. 指导合成具有针对特定加氢反应的定制电子性质的新催化剂。

通过将理论预测与实验验证相结合，研究人员可以更有效地开发用于各种加氢应用的改进型Pt-3d催化剂。
