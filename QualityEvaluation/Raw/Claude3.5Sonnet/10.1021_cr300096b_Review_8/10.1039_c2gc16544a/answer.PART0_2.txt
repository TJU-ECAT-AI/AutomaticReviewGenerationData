[1] "According to DFT calculations, these Pt-terminated surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation."

[2] "Previous studies have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts facilitate the hydrogenation activity in 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene reactions compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "These results are consistent with surface science studies and DFT calculations that correlate binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons with hydrogenation activity. For example, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic surfaces are found to have optimal alkene binding energies, leading to higher hydrogenation activities than the monometallic Pt surface."

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations. The calculations show that Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces have weaker binding of hydrogen and hydrocarbons compared to monometallic Pt, resulting in optimized binding energies. This correlates with experimental observations of higher hydrogenation rates for molecules like 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to Pt alone.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be used to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating binding energies for different adsorbates on various Pt-3d surfaces. Surfaces with optimal (neither too strong nor too weak) binding energies for reactants and intermediates are likely to show enhanced catalytic activity. This information can then guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by allowing researchers to screen potential bimetallic combinations computationally before experimental testing. The approach enables rational catalyst design by providing atomic-level insights into the factors controlling catalytic performance.

DFT计算的Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C=C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附能与实验观察结果有很好的相关性。计算表明,与单金属Pt相比,Pt端接的双金属表面对氢和烃类的结合更弱,resulting in优化的结合能。这与实验观察到的PtNi和PtCo催化剂上1,3-丁二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯等分子的氢化速率高于单一Pt的结果相一致。

这种集成的理论和实验方法可以通过计算不同Pt-3d表面上各种吸附质的结合能来预测氢化活性。对反应物和中间体具有最佳结合能(既不太强也不太弱)的表面可能会表现出增强的催化活性。然后,这些信息可以指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统,允许研究人员在实验测试之前计算筛选潜在的双金属组合。这种方法通过提供控制催化性能的原子级洞察,实现了理性的催化剂设计。
