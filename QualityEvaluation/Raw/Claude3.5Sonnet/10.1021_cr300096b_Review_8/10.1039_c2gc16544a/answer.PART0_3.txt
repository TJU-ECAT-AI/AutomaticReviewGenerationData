The integration of DFT calculations and experimental techniques like TPD measurements provides valuable insights into the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts. DFT calculations show that Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces have weaker binding energies for hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates compared to monometallic Pt surfaces. These optimized binding energies correlate with experimentally observed higher hydrogenation rates.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that Pt-3d bimetallic catalysts outperform monometallic Pt catalysts in hydrogenating various unsaturated hydrocarbons, including cyclic, diene, and aromatic compounds. Specifically, PtNi and PtCo catalysts show enhanced hydrogenation rates for molecules like benzene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene.

This integrated approach of combining theoretical calculations with experimental observations allows researchers to predict hydrogenation activity and design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. By understanding the relationship between surface electronic properties (e.g., d-band center) and adsorbate binding energies, researchers can tailor the composition and structure of Pt-3d catalysts to achieve optimal hydrogenation performance for specific target molecules.

DFT计算和实验技术(如TPD测量)的结合为了解Pt-3d催化剂的氢化活性提供了宝贵的见解。DFT计算表明,与单金属Pt表面相比,Pt-3d双金属表面对氢和烃类吸附质的结合能较弱。这些优化的结合能与实验观察到的更高的氢化速率相关。

实验研究表明,Pt-3d双金属催化剂在各种不饱和烃类(包括环状、二烯和芳香族化合物)的氢化反应中的性能优于单金属Pt催化剂。特别是,PtNi和PtCo催化剂对苯和1,4-环己二烯等分子表现出更高的氢化速率。

这种理论计算与实验观察相结合的综合方法使研究人员能够预测氢化活性并设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。通过理解表面电子性质(如d带中心)和吸附质结合能之间的关系,研究人员可以调整Pt-3d催化剂的成分和结构,以针对特定目标分子实现最佳氢化性能。
