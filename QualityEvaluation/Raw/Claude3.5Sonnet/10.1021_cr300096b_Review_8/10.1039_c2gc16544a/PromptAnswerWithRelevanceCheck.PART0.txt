DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations. The calculations predict that Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces have weaker binding of hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates compared to monometallic Pt surfaces. This leads to optimized binding energies that result in higher hydrogenation rates.

Experimentally, studies have confirmed that PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts show enhanced hydrogenation activity for molecules like 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. Surface science studies and experimental techniques like TPD measurements have validated the DFT predictions of optimal alkene binding energies on PtCo and PtNi surfaces.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by calculating binding energies for target molecules on various Pt-3d surfaces. The approach allows researchers to screen different bimetallic compositions computationally before experimental testing. Promising candidates with near-optimal binding energies can then be synthesized and tested experimentally.

To design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, researchers can use DFT to explore how factors like metal composition, particle size, and support interactions affect binding energies and predicted activity. The computational screening can guide the synthesis of catalysts with tailored electronic properties for specific hydrogenation reactions. Iterative cycles of theory, synthesis, and testing can lead to optimized Pt-3d catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for targeted hydrogenation processes.

The integration of DFT calculations and experimental techniques like TPD measurements provides valuable insights into the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts. DFT calculations show that Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces have weaker binding energies for hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates compared to monometallic Pt surfaces. These optimized binding energies correlate with experimentally observed higher hydrogenation rates.
