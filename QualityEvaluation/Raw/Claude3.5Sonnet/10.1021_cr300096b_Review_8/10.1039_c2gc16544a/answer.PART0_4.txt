[1] "According to DFT calculations, these Pt-terminated surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation."

[2] "Previous studies have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts facilitate the hydrogenation activity in 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene reactions compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst."

[3] "These results are consistent with surface science studies and DFT calculations that correlate binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons with hydrogenation activity. For example, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic surfaces are found to have optimal alkene binding energies, leading to higher hydrogenation activities than the monometallic Pt surface."

DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C=C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques like TPD measurements. The calculations show that Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, resulting in optimized binding energies. This leads to higher hydrogenation rates, which is consistent with experimental observations showing enhanced hydrogenation activity for PtNi and PtCo catalysts compared to monometallic Pt in reactions involving molecules like 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by identifying bimetallic catalysts with optimal binding energies for specific reactants. By understanding the relationship between surface properties and catalytic performance, researchers can design more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems tailored for specific hydrogenation reactions. This approach allows for the rational design of catalysts with improved activity and selectivity, potentially leading to more effective and economical catalytic processes in various industrial applications.

对于各种含C=C键的分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果有很好的相关性。计算表明，相比于单金属Pt表面，Pt-3d双金属表面与氢和碳氢化合物吸附物的结合更弱，导致结合能优化。这导致更高的加氢速率，这与实验观察一致，实验观察显示PtNi和PtCo催化剂在涉及1,3-丁二烯、1,4-环己二烯和苯等分子的反应中比单金属Pt表现出更强的加氢活性。

这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以通过识别特定反应物的最佳结合能的双金属催化剂来预测加氢活性。通过理解表面性质和催化性能之间的关系，研究人员可以设计出针对特定加氢反应的更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。这种方法允许理性设计具有改进的活性和选择性的催化剂，可能导致在各种工业应用中更有效和经济的催化过程。
