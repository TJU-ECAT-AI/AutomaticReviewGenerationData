How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about DFT calculations of surface d-band centers, adsorbate binding energies, or correlations with experimental techniques like TPD for Pt-3d catalysts. The document focuses on experimental studies of hydrogenation reactions over Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts, particularly looking at the effects of fluorine promotion and sulfur poisoning. It does not discuss theoretical calculations or predictions of catalytic activity based on electronic structure. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

This question cannot be directly answered based on the given literature. The document does not contain any information about DFT calculations of surface d-band centers, adsorbate binding energies, or correlations with TPD measurements for Pt-3d catalysts. The literature focuses on experimental studies of hydrogenation reactions over Pt, Pd, and Pt-Pd catalysts, without mentioning theoretical calculations or d-band theory. To answer this question would require additional sources discussing computational studies and their correlation with experimental data for Pt-3d systems.
