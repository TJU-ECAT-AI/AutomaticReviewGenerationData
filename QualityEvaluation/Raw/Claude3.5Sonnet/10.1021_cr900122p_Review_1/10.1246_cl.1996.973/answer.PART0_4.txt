[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."

[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."

[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

The provided literature does not contain enough information to fully answer the question about oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). The text only briefly mentions the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) using chromium oxide catalysts supported on different materials. It does not discuss the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation.

The literature does indicate that carbon dioxide had a promoting effect on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. However, it does not provide detailed information on the reaction mechanisms or the broader context of ODH processes.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to comprehensively analyze the interplay between various catalysts, discuss challenges in selectivity and conversion, or explain proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH of alkanes in general. The text focuses specifically on propane dehydrogenation with a limited set of catalysts and does not address the broader questions posed.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的问题。文本仅简要提到了使用不同材料支持的氧化铬催化剂将丙烷(C3H8)脱氢成丙烯(C3H6)。它没有讨论实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机理或位点隔离的作用。

文献确实指出，二氧化碳对SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂有促进作用，提高了丙烯的产率并抑制了催化剂失活。然而，它没有提供关于反应机理或ODH过程更广泛背景的详细信息。

鉴于提供的信息有限，无法全面分析各种催化剂之间的相互作用，讨论选择性和转化率的挑战，或解释一般烷烃ODH的提议反应机理。文本特别关注于使用有限的一组催化剂进行丙烷脱氢，并没有解答所提出的更广泛问题。
