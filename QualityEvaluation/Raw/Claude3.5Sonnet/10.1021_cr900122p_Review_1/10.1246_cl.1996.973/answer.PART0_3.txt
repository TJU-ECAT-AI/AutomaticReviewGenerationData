The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) as requested in the question. The text focuses on a specific study of propane dehydrogenation using carbon dioxide and Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials.

The study investigated the effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to produce propylene (C3H6) using Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. The results showed that carbon dioxide had promoting effects only on the SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. These promoting effects included enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

This information provides a limited insight into one specific catalyst system for alkane dehydrogenation, but does not address the broader aspects of ODH, various catalysts, challenges in selectivity and conversion, or detailed reaction mechanisms as requested in the question. The study does not discuss bulk metal oxides, C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction. Additionally, the concept of site isolation is not mentioned in the provided text.

Given the limited scope of the provided literature, a comprehensive answer to the question as posed cannot be provided based solely on this information.

所提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面分析烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)，如问题所要求的那样。这篇文本主要关注使用二氧化碳和不同材料支撑的Cr2O3催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的具体研究。

该研究考察了二氧化碳对使用Al2O3、活性炭和SiO2支撑的Cr2O3催化剂进行丙烷(C3H8)脱氢生成丙烯(C3H6)的影响。结果表明，二氧化碳只对SiO2支撑的Cr2O3催化剂有促进作用。这些促进作用包括提高丙烯的产率和抑制催化剂失活。

这些信息为烷烃脱氢的一个特定催化剂系统提供了有限的见解，但没有涉及问题中要求的ODH的更广泛方面、各种催化剂、选择性和转化率的挑战，或详细的反应机理。该研究没有讨论体相金属氧化物、C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提。此外，所提供的文本中没有提到位点隔离的概念。

鉴于所提供文献的范围有限，仅基于这些信息无法对所提出的问题给出全面的回答。
