[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2."

[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst."

[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

The given literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). The document focuses on a specific case of propane dehydrogenation using carbon dioxide over chromium oxide catalysts. It does not discuss the broader aspects of ODH, various catalysts, challenges in selectivity and conversion, or detailed reaction mechanisms.

Based on the limited information provided:

1. The study investigated the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to produce propylene (C3H6) using carbon dioxide as a promoter.

2. Different supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts were tested, including those supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2.

3. The SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst showed unique promoting effects when carbon dioxide was present.

4. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide on the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst included enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation.

The document does not provide information on the interplay between various catalysts, challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, proposed reaction mechanisms, or the role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of ODH as requested in the question cannot be provided based solely on this literature.

给定的文献并未提供足够的信息来全面回答关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的问题。该文档主要集中在使用二氧化碳通过氧化铬催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的特定案例上。它没有讨论ODH的更广泛方面、各种催化剂、选择性和转化率方面的挑战，或详细的反应机理。

基于所提供的有限信息：

1. 该研究调查了使用二氧化碳作为促进剂将丙烷(C3H8)脱氢生成丙烯(C3H6)的过程。

2. 测试了不同的负载型氧化铬(Cr2O3)催化剂，包括负载在Al2O3、活性炭和SiO2上的催化剂。

3. 当存在二氧化碳时，SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂显示出独特的促进效果。

4. 二氧化碳对Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的促进效果包括提高丙烯产率和抑制催化剂失活。

该文档没有提供关于各种催化剂之间相互作用、实现高选择性和转化率的挑战、提出的反应机理或位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用等信息。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法提供问题中要求的ODH全面分析。
