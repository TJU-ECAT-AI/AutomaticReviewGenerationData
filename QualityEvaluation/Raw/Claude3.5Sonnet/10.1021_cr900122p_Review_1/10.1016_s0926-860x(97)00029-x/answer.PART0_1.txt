[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins, the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]."

[2] "The selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."

[3] "According to the mechanism proposed for the selective oxidation of n-butane on VPO catalysts, the first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary carbon atom. However, depending on the catalysts, this abstraction can give rise to the formation of three different intermediates (Fig. 9), that after a second H-abstraction can be transformed into olefins, O-containing partial oxidation products or carbon oxides."

[4] "The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support. In addition, and concluding from the most selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins."

[5] "In this way, it appear that the rate of both the formation of the olefinic intermediate and the olefin desorption depend on the acid-base character of catalysts, and they can be considered as selectivity determining steps."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown promise as selective catalysts for ODH reactions, offering improved performance compared to bulk V2O5.

The interplay between catalysts and reaction efficiency involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst composition: Supported vanadium oxide catalysts generally show higher selectivity and activity compared to bulk V2O5. The support material and vanadium loading significantly affect catalyst performance.

2. Site isolation: Highly dispersed vanadium species on the support, particularly in low coordination numbers, help limit consecutive reactions of formed olefins, thereby improving selectivity.

3. Acid-base properties: The acid-base character of the catalyst influences the formation and desorption rates of olefinic intermediates, which are crucial selectivity-determining steps.

4. Reaction mechanism: The ODH process typically involves C-H bond activation through H-abstraction, forming alkyl intermediates. A second H-abstraction leads to the formation of olefins. Depending on the catalyst properties, this process can also lead to the formation of oxygenated products or carbon oxides.

5. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion: The main challenge lies in balancing the desired ODH reaction with undesired consecutive oxidation reactions. This requires careful tuning of catalyst properties, including vanadium dispersion, coordination environment, and support characteristics.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by limiting the availability of adjacent active sites that could promote unwanted consecutive reactions. This is achieved through high dispersion of vanadium species on the support and maintaining a low coordination number for vanadium.

Overall, the efficiency of the ODH process is a result of the complex interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions. Optimizing these factors can lead to improved selectivity and conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。负载型钒氧化物催化剂在ODH反应中表现出良好的选择性,比体相V2O5性能更优。

催化剂与反应效率之间的相互作用涉及几个关键方面:

1. 催化剂组成:负载型钒氧化物催化剂通常比体相V2O5表现出更高的选择性和活性。载体材料和钒负载量显著影响催化剂性能。

2. 位点隔离:高度分散在载体上的钒物种,特别是低配位数的钒物种,有助于限制生成烯烃的连续反应,从而提高选择性。

3. 酸碱性质:催化剂的酸碱性影响烯烃中间体的生成和脱附速率,这是决定选择性的关键步骤。

4. 反应机理:ODH过程通常涉及通过氢原子抽取的C-H键活化,形成烷基中间体。第二次氢原子抽取导致烯烃的形成。根据催化剂性质,这个过程也可能导致含氧产物或碳氧化物的形成。

5. 实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战:主要挑战在于平衡所需的ODH反应与不需要的连续氧化反应。这需要仔细调整催化剂性质,包括钒的分散度、配位环境和载体特性。

位点隔离通过限制可能促进不需要的连续反应的相邻活性位点的可用性,在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。这是通过钒物种在载体上的高度分散和保持钒的低配位数来实现的。

总的来说,ODH过程的效率是催化剂组成、结构和反应条件复杂相互作用的结果。优化这些因素可以提高烷烃氧化脱氢的选择性和转化率。
