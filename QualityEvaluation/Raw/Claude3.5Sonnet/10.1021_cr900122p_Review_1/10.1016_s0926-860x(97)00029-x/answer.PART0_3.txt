[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins, the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]."

[2] "The selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."

[3] "According to the mechanism proposed for the selective oxidation of n-butane on VPO catalysts, the first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary carbon atom. However, depending on the catalysts, this abstraction can give rise to the formation of three different intermediates (Fig. 9), that after a second H-abstraction can be transformed into olefins, O-containing partial oxidation products or carbon oxides."

[4] "On the most basic metal oxide supports, i.e. MgO-supported vanadia catalysts, isolated VO4 tetrahedra without bridging V-O-V oxygen ions (Q(0) type) forming Mg3V2O8-like structures are observed within a larger range of V content [25-32]."

[5] "The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these materials. In addition, the appearance of acid and/or basic sites, that strongly depend on the nature of the metal oxide support, determines the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depending on the alkane fed."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and reaction mechanisms. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown promise for selective ODH reactions, offering improved performance compared to bulk V2O5.

The interplay between catalysts and reaction efficiency involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst type: Supported vanadium oxides generally exhibit higher selectivity than bulk V2O5. The support material (e.g., MgO, Al2O3, SiO2) significantly affects catalyst performance.

2. Active sites: Isolated VO4 tetrahedra, particularly on basic supports like MgO, appear to be highly selective for ODH reactions. The coordination and aggregation state of vanadium species influence product distribution.

3. Reaction mechanism: The process typically involves C-H bond activation via H-abstraction, followed by formation of intermediates. A second H-abstraction leads to olefins, partial oxidation products, or carbon oxides, depending on catalyst properties.

4. Selectivity challenges: Achieving high selectivity while maintaining high conversion is a major challenge. Consecutive reactions of olefins can lead to undesired products.

5. Site isolation: Dispersing vanadium species on supports helps isolate active sites, which can enhance selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions.

6. Support effects: The acid-base character of the support influences vanadium dispersion, reducibility, and the nature of active sites. This, in turn, affects catalyst activity and selectivity.

7. Redox properties: The reducibility of V-O-support bonds impacts catalytic activity, while the presence of V=O bonds can promote oxygen insertion reactions.

To optimize ODH processes, catalyst design must balance these factors to achieve high dispersion of vanadium species, appropriate acid-base properties, and suitable redox characteristics. Site isolation through proper support selection and controlled vanadium loading is crucial for addressing selectivity issues by minimizing consecutive reactions of olefins.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受催化剂组成和反应机理等多种因素影响的复杂过程。负载型钒氧化物催化剂在选择性ODH反应中表现出了良好的前景，相比于块状V2O5提供了更好的性能。

催化剂与反应效率之间的相互作用涉及几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂类型：负载型钒氧化物通常比块状V2O5表现出更高的选择性。载体材料（如MgO、Al2O3、SiO2）显著影响催化剂性能。

2. 活性位点：孤立的VO4四面体，特别是在MgO等碱性载体上，似乎对ODH反应具有高度选择性。钒物种的配位和聚集状态影响产物分布。

3. 反应机理：该过程通常涉及通过H原子抽取的C-H键活化，随后形成中间体。第二次H原子抽取导致生成烯烃、部分氧化产物或碳氧化物，具体取决于催化剂性质。

4. 选择性挑战：在保持高转化率的同时实现高选择性是一个主要挑战。烯烃的连续反应可能导致不期望的产物。

5. 位点隔离：在载体上分散钒物种有助于隔离活性位点，这可以通过限制不需要的副反应来提高选择性。

6. 载体效应：载体的酸碱性影响钒的分散、可还原性和活性位点的性质。这反过来又影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

7. 氧化还原性质：V-O-载体键的可还原性影响催化活性，而V=O键的存在可以促进氧插入反应。

为了优化ODH过程，催化剂设计必须平衡这些因素，以实现钒物种的高度分散、适当的酸碱性和合适的氧化还原特性。通过适当的载体选择和控制钒负载量来实现位点隔离对解决选择性问题至关重要，因为这可以最小化烯烃的连续反应。
