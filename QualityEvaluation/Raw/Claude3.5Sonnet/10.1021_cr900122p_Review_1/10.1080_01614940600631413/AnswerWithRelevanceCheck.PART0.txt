          [1] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."

[2] "The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction, but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K)."

[3] "The catalytic activity for catalysts based on reducible oxides is usually significantly higher, but selectivities to alkenes is lower in comparison with selectivities of the systems described above."

[4] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[5] "It has been shown (86) that the interaction of an organic molecule with various defects led to the cleavage of the C-H bond, which proceeded by the transfer of two electrons to the empty vanadium surface levels and the formation of adsorbed alkoxy and surface hydroxyl species."

[6] "Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst."

[7] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."

[8] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction. For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57)."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. The main challenge lies in developing catalysts that selectively activate C-H bonds while minimizing over-oxidation.

Catalysts for ODH include bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Alkali and alkaline earth-based catalysts (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show high selectivity but require high temperatures. Reducible oxide catalysts offer higher activity but lower selectivity. Vanadium-based catalysts are particularly prominent, with their performance influenced by factors such as the strength and reducibility of V-O-support bonds, and the nature of the support and additives.

The proposed reaction mechanism typically involves four steps: weak adsorption of alkane, C-H bond rupture forming alkyl species, reaction with surface oxygen to form alkene, and catalyst regeneration. C-H bond activation is crucial and can occur through various mechanisms, such as electron transfer to empty vanadium surface levels.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated metal sites, such as VO4 tetrahedra in zeolites, have shown improved propene yields. The coordination number of active centers also affects the reaction path, with higher coordination numbers favoring oxygen insertion and leading to unwanted products.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, surface properties, and reaction conditions. Balancing these factors is crucial for developing catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and conversion in the ODH of alkanes.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂、反应机理和位点隔离等多种因素影响的复杂过程。主要挑战在于开发能选择性活化C-H键同时最小化过度氧化的催化剂。

ODH的催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统。碱金属和碱土金属基催化剂(如Li2CO3/MgO)表现出高选择性，但需要高温。可还原氧化物催化剂提供更高的活性但选择性较低。钒基催化剂尤为突出，其性能受到V-O-载体键的强度和可还原性、载体性质和添加剂等因素的影响。

提议的反应机理通常包括四个步骤：烷烃的弱吸附、C-H键断裂形成烷基物种、与表面氧反应形成烯烃，以及催化剂再生。C-H键活化至关重要，可以通过各种机制发生，如电子转移到空的钒表面能级。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着重要作用。例如，沸石中隔离的VO4四面体等隔离金属位点已显示出改善的丙烯产率。活性中心的配位数也影响反应路径，较高的配位数有利于氧插入，导致不需要的产物。

ODH过程的效率受到催化剂组成、表面性质和反应条件之间相互作用的共同影响。平衡这些因素对于开发能在烷烃ODH中同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂至关重要。
