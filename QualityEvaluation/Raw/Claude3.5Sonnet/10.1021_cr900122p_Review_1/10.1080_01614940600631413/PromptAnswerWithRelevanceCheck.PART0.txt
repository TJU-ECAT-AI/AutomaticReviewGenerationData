[1] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."

[2] "The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa."

[3] "The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction, but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K)."

[4] "The catalytic activity for catalysts based on reducible oxides is usually significantly higher, but selectivities to alkenes is lower in comparison with selectivities of the systems described above."

[5] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[6] "It was also shown that the terminal bond considered earlier as active in selective oxidation had low activity (8082). The same method was also used to study catalytic properties such as reactivity of differently coordinated surface oxygen (82), effects of additives of vanadia-based catalysts for ODHP (83, 84), and energetics of the reoxidation process (85)."

[7] "Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst type, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. 

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH efficiency. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are commonly used. Alkali and alkaline earth-based catalysts like Li2CO3/MgO show high selectivity but require high temperatures. Reducible oxide catalysts offer higher activity but lower selectivity. The challenge lies in developing catalysts that selectively activate C-H bonds while minimizing over-oxidation.

The reaction mechanism typically involves several steps: alkane adsorption on the catalyst surface, C-H bond rupture to form alkyl species, reaction with surface oxygen to form alkene, and catalyst reoxidation. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and 2H-abstraction are key processes. The strength and reducibility of bridging metal-oxygen-support bonds significantly influence reactivity.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a major challenge in ODH. The consecutive nature of the reaction network often leads to over-oxidation of desired products. Catalyst design aims to optimize the ratio of alkane activation rate to alkene oxidation rate.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated metal ions, such as vanadium in zeolite matrices, have shown promise in achieving higher yields of desired products. The tetrahedron structure of isolated VO4 units has been proposed as an active site in some catalysts.

The interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation collectively determines ODH efficiency. Ongoing research focuses on understanding structure-activity relationships and developing novel catalysts to overcome current limitations in selectivity and conversion.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程,包括催化剂类型、反应机理和位点隔离。

催化剂在ODH效率中起着关键作用。常用的催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和负载型体系。碱金属和碱土金属基催化剂(如Li2CO3/MgO)表现出高选择性,但需要高温。可还原氧化物催化剂活性更高,但选择性较低。开发能选择性活化C-H键同时最小化过度氧化的催化剂是一大挑战。

反应机理通常包括几个步骤:烷烃在催化剂表面吸附、C-H键断裂形成烷基物种、与表面氧反应形成烯烃,以及催化剂再氧化。M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提是关键过程。桥接金属-氧-载体键的强度和可还原性显著影响反应活性。

在ODH中同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍是一个主要挑战。反应网络的连续性常导致目标产物的过度氧化。催化剂设计旨在优化烷烃活化速率与烯烃氧化速率的比例。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。例如,在沸石基质中隔离的金属离子(如钒)在获得更高目标产物收率方面显示出前景。一些催化剂中已提出隔离的VO4四面体结构作为活性位点。

催化剂性质、反应机理和位点隔离之间的相互作用共同决定了ODH的效率。当前研究重点是理解结构-活性关系,并开发新型催化剂以克服选择性和转化率方面的限制。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, presenting challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion.

Catalysts for ODH can be broadly categorized into two groups: alkali/alkaline earth-based catalysts and reducible metal oxide catalysts. The former, such as Li2CO3/MgO, show high selectivity but require high operating temperatures. The latter, including vanadium and molybdenum oxides, offer higher activity but lower selectivity to alkenes.

The proposed reaction mechanism for ODH typically involves four key steps: weak adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface, C-H bond rupture to form alkyl species, reaction of alkyl species with surface oxygen to form alkene, and catalyst regeneration through cyclic reduction/reoxidation.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by several factors. C-H bond activation is a crucial step, often facilitated by defects on the catalyst surface. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent β-elimination play key roles in alkene production. However, over-oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides remains a significant challenge, impacting selectivity.

Site isolation has emerged as an important strategy to address selectivity issues. For instance, isolating vanadium ions within zeolite matrices has led to catalysts with higher propene yields. The isolated VO4 tetrahedron structure has been proposed as an active site in some catalysts, demonstrating the importance of controlling the local environment of active species.

The balance between activity and selectivity remains a key challenge in ODH. While reducible metal oxides offer higher activity, they often suffer from lower selectivity. Conversely, alkali/alkaline earth-based catalysts show higher selectivity but require higher temperatures. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing catalyst compositions and structures to achieve both high activity and selectivity, with site isolation strategies showing promise in this regard.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，在实现高选择性和转化率方面存在挑战。

ODH的催化剂可以大致分为两类：碱金属/碱土金属基催化剂和可还原金属氧化物催化剂。前者，如Li2CO3/MgO，显示出高选择性但需要高操作温度。后者，包括钒和钼氧化物，提供更高的活性但对烯烃的选择性较低。

ODH的提议反应机理通常涉及四个关键步骤：烷烃在催化剂表面的弱吸附，C-H键断裂形成烷基物种，烷基物种与表面氧反应形成烯烃，以及通过循环还原/再氧化实现催化剂再生。

ODH过程的效率受多个因素影响。C-H键活化是一个关键步骤，通常由催化剂表面的缺陷促进。M-烷基中间体的形成和随后的β-消除在烯烃生产中起关键作用。然而，烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物仍然是一个重大挑战，影响选择性。

位点隔离已成为解决选择性问题的重要策略。例如，在沸石基质中隔离钒离子已导致具有更高丙烯产率的催化剂。在某些催化剂中，隔离的VO4四面体结构被提议为活性位点，显示了控制活性物种局部环境的重要性。

活性和选择性之间的平衡仍然是ODH的一个关键挑战。虽然可还原金属氧化物提供更高的活性，但它们通常选择性较低。相反，碱金属/碱土金属基催化剂显示出更高的选择性，但需要更高的温度。正在进行的研究集中于优化催化剂组成和结构，以实现高活性和选择性，其中位点隔离策略在这方面显示出前景。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. 

Catalysts for ODH include bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being prominent examples. These catalysts can exist in both monomeric and polymeric forms, with the V(Mo)-O terminal bond not directly involved in the oxidation reactions. The coordination number of the active center plays a crucial role in determining the reaction path, with higher coordination numbers favoring oxygen insertion and leading to the formation of oxygenated products or carbon oxides.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is primarily due to the tendency of alkenes (the desired products) to undergo further oxidation to carbon oxides. The key to addressing this issue lies in developing catalysts that selectively activate C-H bonds in alkane molecules.

The proposed reaction mechanism for ODH typically involves four main steps: 1) weak adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface, 2) C-H bond rupture to form alkyl species, 3) reaction of the alkyl species with surface oxygen to form alkene, and 4) catalyst regeneration through a redox cycle. This mechanism highlights the importance of the catalyst's ability to selectively activate C-H bonds and control the subsequent oxidation steps.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. For example, isolating vanadium ions inside a zeolite matrix has been shown to produce catalysts with high propene yields. The isolated VO4 tetrahedron structure in VAPO-5 catalysts has been proposed as an active site for this reaction. This approach of site isolation helps limit over-oxidation by controlling the availability and distribution of active sites.

In summary, the efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by a complex interplay of factors including catalyst composition and structure, reaction mechanisms, and the degree of site isolation. Balancing these factors is crucial for developing catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and conversion in the ODH of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。

ODH的催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中钒和钼氧化物是典型代表。这些催化剂可以以单体和聚合物形式存在，V(Mo)-O端键不直接参与氧化反应。活性中心的配位数在决定反应路径中起着关键作用，较高的配位数有利于氧插入，导致含氧产物或碳氧化物的形成。

ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。这主要是由于烯烃（所需产物）容易进一步氧化成碳氧化物。解决这一问题的关键在于开发能选择性活化烷烃分子C-H键的催化剂。

ODH的提议反应机理通常包括四个主要步骤：1）烷烃在催化剂表面的弱吸附，2）C-H键断裂形成烷基物种，3）烷基物种与表面氧反应形成烯烃，4）通过氧化还原循环实现催化剂再生。这一机理突出了催化剂选择性活化C-H键和控制后续氧化步骤的能力的重要性。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。例如，将钒离子隔离在沸石基质内已被证明可以产生高丙烯产率的催化剂。VAPO-5催化剂中的孤立VO4四面体结构被提出作为这一反应的活性位点。这种位点隔离的方法通过控制活性位点的可用性和分布来帮助限制过度氧化。

总之，ODH过程的效率受到催化剂组成和结构、反应机理以及位点隔离程度等因素复杂相互作用的影响。平衡这些因素对于开发能在烷烃ODH中同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂至关重要。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through careful catalyst design and understanding of reaction pathways.

Catalyst types play a crucial role in ODH efficiency. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being prominent examples. The nature of the support and additives affects the acid-base properties and the formation of active sites, which in turn influences catalytic performance.

The proposed reaction mechanisms involve several key steps: initial adsorption of alkanes, C-H bond activation leading to alkyl species formation, reaction with surface oxygen to form alkenes, and catalyst regeneration. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent β-elimination are critical for alkene production. However, competing pathways such as alkoxide formation can lead to over-oxidation, reducing selectivity.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. Monomeric and polymeric units of vanadium and molybdenum oxides can be active in ODH, but their coordination environment is crucial. Higher coordination numbers (>4) for vanadium tend to favor oxygen insertion, leading to undesired oxygenated products or complete oxidation.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, surface properties, and reaction conditions. Factors such as the strength and reducibility of metal-oxygen bonds, the nature of the support, and the presence of promoters all contribute to determining the balance between desired alkene formation and unwanted side reactions.

To optimize ODH performance, researchers focus on tailoring catalyst properties to favor selective C-H bond activation while minimizing over-oxidation pathways. This involves careful control of metal oxidation states, optimization of support interactions, and strategic use of promoters to modulate acid-base and redox properties of the catalytic system.

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着重要作用。钒和钼氧化物的单体和聚合单元可以在ODH中活跃,但它们的配位环境至关重要。钒的较高配位数(>4)倾向于促进氧插入,导致不需要的含氧产物或完全氧化。

ODH过程的效率受到催化剂组成、表面性质和反应条件之间相互作用的共同影响。诸如金属-氧键的强度和可还原性、载体的性质以及促进剂的存在等因素都有助于决定所需烯烃形成和不需要的副反应之间的平衡。

为了优化ODH性能,研究人员专注于调整催化剂性质,以有利于选择性C-H键活化,同时最小化过度氧化途径。这涉及对金属氧化态的精确控制、载体相互作用的优化,以及战略性使用促进剂来调节催化系统的酸碱和氧化还原性质。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. 

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH reactions. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with vanadium-based catalysts being particularly prominent. The nature of the support and additives can significantly affect catalyst performance by influencing the strength and reducibility of bridging oxygen ions and the formation of acid/base centers.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is difficult because the desired alkene products are often more reactive than the alkane reactants, leading to over-oxidation and reduced selectivity.

The proposed reaction mechanism for ODH typically involves several steps:
1. Weak adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface
2. C-H bond activation leading to alkyl species formation
3. Reaction of alkyl species with surface oxygen to form alkene
4. Catalyst regeneration through cyclic reduction/reoxidation

The C-H bond activation step is crucial and can occur through various mechanisms depending on the catalyst and alkane involved. For instance, the interaction of organic molecules with surface defects can lead to C-H bond cleavage via electron transfer to empty vanadium surface levels.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated metal sites, such as isolated VO4 tetrahedra in zeolites, have been shown to improve propene yields. This is likely due to the limited availability of adjacent oxygen species, which reduces the probability of over-oxidation.

The interplay between these factors collectively influences process efficiency. The choice of catalyst, its composition and structure, the reaction conditions, and the understanding of reaction mechanisms all contribute to optimizing the balance between conversion and selectivity in ODH reactions.

C-H键活化步骤至关重要，可以通过各种机制发生，取决于所涉及的催化剂和烷烃。例如，有机分子与表面缺陷的相互作用可以通过电子转移到空的钒表面能级来导致C-H键断裂。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着重要作用。已经证明，隔离的金属位点，如沸石中隔离的VO4四面体，可以提高丙烯产率。这可能是由于相邻氧物种的有限可用性，减少了过度氧化的概率。

这些因素的相互作用共同影响过程效率。催化剂的选择、其组成和结构、反应条件以及对反应机理的理解都有助于优化ODH反应中转化率和选择性之间的平衡。
