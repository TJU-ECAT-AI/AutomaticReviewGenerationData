[1] "The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction (13), but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K)."

[2] "The catalytic activity for catalysts based on reducible oxides is usually significantly higher, but selectivities to alkenes is lower in comparison with selectivities of the systems described above."

[3] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[4] "It has been shown (86) that the interaction of an organic molecule with various defects led to the cleavage of the C-H bond, which proceeded by the transfer of two electrons to the empty vanadium surface levels and the formation of adsorbed alkoxy and surface hydroxyl species."

[5] "Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, presenting challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion.

Catalysts for ODH can be broadly categorized into two groups: alkali/alkaline earth-based catalysts and reducible metal oxide catalysts. The former, such as Li2CO3/MgO, show high selectivity but require high operating temperatures. The latter, including vanadium and molybdenum oxides, offer higher activity but lower selectivity to alkenes.

The proposed reaction mechanism for ODH typically involves four key steps: weak adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface, C-H bond rupture to form alkyl species, reaction of alkyl species with surface oxygen to form alkene, and catalyst regeneration through cyclic reduction/reoxidation.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by several factors. C-H bond activation is a crucial step, often facilitated by defects on the catalyst surface. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent β-elimination play key roles in alkene production. However, over-oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides remains a significant challenge, impacting selectivity.

Site isolation has emerged as an important strategy to address selectivity issues. For instance, isolating vanadium ions within zeolite matrices has led to catalysts with higher propene yields. The isolated VO4 tetrahedron structure has been proposed as an active site in some catalysts, demonstrating the importance of controlling the local environment of active species.

The balance between activity and selectivity remains a key challenge in ODH. While reducible metal oxides offer higher activity, they often suffer from lower selectivity. Conversely, alkali/alkaline earth-based catalysts show higher selectivity but require higher temperatures. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing catalyst compositions and structures to achieve both high activity and selectivity, with site isolation strategies showing promise in this regard.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，在实现高选择性和转化率方面存在挑战。

ODH的催化剂可以大致分为两类：碱金属/碱土金属基催化剂和可还原金属氧化物催化剂。前者，如Li2CO3/MgO，显示出高选择性但需要高操作温度。后者，包括钒和钼氧化物，提供更高的活性但对烯烃的选择性较低。

ODH的提议反应机理通常涉及四个关键步骤：烷烃在催化剂表面的弱吸附，C-H键断裂形成烷基物种，烷基物种与表面氧反应形成烯烃，以及通过循环还原/再氧化实现催化剂再生。

ODH过程的效率受多个因素影响。C-H键活化是一个关键步骤，通常由催化剂表面的缺陷促进。M-烷基中间体的形成和随后的β-消除在烯烃生产中起关键作用。然而，烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物仍然是一个重大挑战，影响选择性。

位点隔离已成为解决选择性问题的重要策略。例如，在沸石基质中隔离钒离子已导致具有更高丙烯产率的催化剂。在某些催化剂中，隔离的VO4四面体结构被提议为活性位点，显示了控制活性物种局部环境的重要性。

活性和选择性之间的平衡仍然是ODH的一个关键挑战。虽然可还原金属氧化物提供更高的活性，但它们通常选择性较低。相反，碱金属/碱土金属基催化剂显示出更高的选择性，但需要更高的温度。正在进行的研究集中于优化催化剂组成和结构，以实现高活性和选择性，其中位点隔离策略在这方面显示出前景。
