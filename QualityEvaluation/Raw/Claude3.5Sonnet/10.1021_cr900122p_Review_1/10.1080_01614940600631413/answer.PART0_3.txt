Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[2] "The surface alkyl species can also form alkoxide (73, 74) species (a competing pathway), which can be further oxidized to aldehydes and carboxylates and then to carbon oxides."

[3] "It has been shown that for vanadium and molybdenum oxides, both monomeric (77, 78) and polymeric (65, 79) units can be considered as active in ODH of lower alkanes and that the V(Mo)-O terminal bond is not involved in the oxidation reactions."

[4] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction. For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57)."

[5] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through careful catalyst design and understanding of reaction pathways.

Catalyst types play a crucial role in ODH efficiency. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being prominent examples. The nature of the support and additives affects the acid-base properties and the formation of active sites, which in turn influences catalytic performance.

The proposed reaction mechanisms involve several key steps: initial adsorption of alkanes, C-H bond activation leading to alkyl species formation, reaction with surface oxygen to form alkenes, and catalyst regeneration. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent β-elimination are critical for alkene production. However, competing pathways such as alkoxide formation can lead to over-oxidation, reducing selectivity.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. Monomeric and polymeric units of vanadium and molybdenum oxides can be active in ODH, but their coordination environment is crucial. Higher coordination numbers (>4) for vanadium tend to favor oxygen insertion, leading to undesired oxygenated products or complete oxidation.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, surface properties, and reaction conditions. Factors such as the strength and reducibility of metal-oxygen bonds, the nature of the support, and the presence of promoters all contribute to determining the balance between desired alkene formation and unwanted side reactions.

To optimize ODH performance, researchers focus on tailoring catalyst properties to favor selective C-H bond activation while minimizing over-oxidation pathways. This involves careful control of metal oxidation states, optimization of support interactions, and strategic use of promoters to modulate acid-base and redox properties of the catalytic system.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程,受到与催化剂和反应机理相关的各种因素的影响。通过精心设计催化剂和理解反应途径来解决实现高选择性和高转化率的主要挑战。

催化剂类型在ODH效率中起着关键作用。块状金属氧化物和负载型系统都被使用,其中钒和钼氧化物是突出的例子。载体的性质和添加剂影响酸碱性质和活性位的形成,从而影响催化性能。

提出的反应机理包括几个关键步骤:烷烃的初始吸附、导致烷基物种形成的C-H键活化、与表面氧反应形成烯烃,以及催化剂再生。M-烷基中间体的形成和随后的β-消除对烯烃的生成至关重要。然而,诸如烷氧化物形成等竞争途径可能导致过度氧化,降低选择性。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着重要作用。钒和钼氧化物的单体和聚合单元可以在ODH中活跃,但它们的配位环境至关重要。钒的较高配位数(>4)倾向于促进氧插入,导致不需要的含氧产物或完全氧化。

ODH过程的效率受到催化剂组成、表面性质和反应条件之间相互作用的共同影响。诸如金属-氧键的强度和可还原性、载体的性质以及促进剂的存在等因素都有助于决定所需烯烃形成和不需要的副反应之间的平衡。

为了优化ODH性能,研究人员专注于调整催化剂性质,以有利于选择性C-H键活化,同时最小化过度氧化途径。这涉及对金属氧化态的精确控制、载体相互作用的优化,以及战略性使用促进剂来调节催化系统的酸碱和氧化还原性质。
