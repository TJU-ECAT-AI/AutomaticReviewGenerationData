[1] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."

[2] "The best catalytic systems in ODHE are often very poor in the ODH of higher alkanes and vice versa."

[3] "The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction, but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K)."

[4] "The catalytic activity for catalysts based on reducible oxides is usually significantly higher, but selectivities to alkenes is lower in comparison with selectivities of the systems described above."

[5] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[6] "It was also shown that the terminal bond considered earlier as active in selective oxidation had low activity (8082). The same method was also used to study catalytic properties such as reactivity of differently coordinated surface oxygen (82), effects of additives of vanadia-based catalysts for ODHP (83, 84), and energetics of the reoxidation process (85)."

[7] "Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst type, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. 

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH efficiency. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are commonly used. Alkali and alkaline earth-based catalysts like Li2CO3/MgO show high selectivity but require high temperatures. Reducible oxide catalysts offer higher activity but lower selectivity. The challenge lies in developing catalysts that selectively activate C-H bonds while minimizing over-oxidation.

The reaction mechanism typically involves several steps: alkane adsorption on the catalyst surface, C-H bond rupture to form alkyl species, reaction with surface oxygen to form alkene, and catalyst reoxidation. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and 2H-abstraction are key processes. The strength and reducibility of bridging metal-oxygen-support bonds significantly influence reactivity.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a major challenge in ODH. The consecutive nature of the reaction network often leads to over-oxidation of desired products. Catalyst design aims to optimize the ratio of alkane activation rate to alkene oxidation rate.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated metal ions, such as vanadium in zeolite matrices, have shown promise in achieving higher yields of desired products. The tetrahedron structure of isolated VO4 units has been proposed as an active site in some catalysts.

The interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation collectively determines ODH efficiency. Ongoing research focuses on understanding structure-activity relationships and developing novel catalysts to overcome current limitations in selectivity and conversion.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程,包括催化剂类型、反应机理和位点隔离。

催化剂在ODH效率中起着关键作用。常用的催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和负载型体系。碱金属和碱土金属基催化剂(如Li2CO3/MgO)表现出高选择性,但需要高温。可还原氧化物催化剂活性更高,但选择性较低。开发能选择性活化C-H键同时最小化过度氧化的催化剂是一大挑战。

反应机理通常包括几个步骤:烷烃在催化剂表面吸附、C-H键断裂形成烷基物种、与表面氧反应形成烯烃,以及催化剂再氧化。M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提是关键过程。桥接金属-氧-载体键的强度和可还原性显著影响反应活性。

在ODH中同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍是一个主要挑战。反应网络的连续性常导致目标产物的过度氧化。催化剂设计旨在优化烷烃活化速率与烯烃氧化速率的比例。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。例如,在沸石基质中隔离的金属离子(如钒)在获得更高目标产物收率方面显示出前景。一些催化剂中已提出隔离的VO4四面体结构作为活性位点。

催化剂性质、反应机理和位点隔离之间的相互作用共同决定了ODH的效率。当前研究重点是理解结构-活性关系,并开发新型催化剂以克服选择性和转化率方面的限制。
