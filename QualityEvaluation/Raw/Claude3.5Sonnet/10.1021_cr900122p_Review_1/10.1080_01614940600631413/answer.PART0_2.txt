[1] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."

[2] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[3] "It has been shown that for vanadium and molybdenum oxides, both monomeric (77, 78) and polymeric (65, 79) units can be considered as active in ODH of lower alkanes and that the V(Mo)-O terminal bond is not involved in the oxidation reactions."

[4] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction. For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57)."

[5] "Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. 

Catalysts for ODH include bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being prominent examples. These catalysts can exist in both monomeric and polymeric forms, with the V(Mo)-O terminal bond not directly involved in the oxidation reactions. The coordination number of the active center plays a crucial role in determining the reaction path, with higher coordination numbers favoring oxygen insertion and leading to the formation of oxygenated products or carbon oxides.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is primarily due to the tendency of alkenes (the desired products) to undergo further oxidation to carbon oxides. The key to addressing this issue lies in developing catalysts that selectively activate C-H bonds in alkane molecules.

The proposed reaction mechanism for ODH typically involves four main steps: 1) weak adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface, 2) C-H bond rupture to form alkyl species, 3) reaction of the alkyl species with surface oxygen to form alkene, and 4) catalyst regeneration through a redox cycle. This mechanism highlights the importance of the catalyst's ability to selectively activate C-H bonds and control the subsequent oxidation steps.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. For example, isolating vanadium ions inside a zeolite matrix has been shown to produce catalysts with high propene yields. The isolated VO4 tetrahedron structure in VAPO-5 catalysts has been proposed as an active site for this reaction. This approach of site isolation helps limit over-oxidation by controlling the availability and distribution of active sites.

In summary, the efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by a complex interplay of factors including catalyst composition and structure, reaction mechanisms, and the degree of site isolation. Balancing these factors is crucial for developing catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and conversion in the ODH of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。

ODH的催化剂包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中钒和钼氧化物是典型代表。这些催化剂可以以单体和聚合物形式存在，V(Mo)-O端键不直接参与氧化反应。活性中心的配位数在决定反应路径中起着关键作用，较高的配位数有利于氧插入，导致含氧产物或碳氧化物的形成。

ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。这主要是由于烯烃（所需产物）容易进一步氧化成碳氧化物。解决这一问题的关键在于开发能选择性活化烷烃分子C-H键的催化剂。

ODH的提议反应机理通常包括四个主要步骤：1）烷烃在催化剂表面的弱吸附，2）C-H键断裂形成烷基物种，3）烷基物种与表面氧反应形成烯烃，4）通过氧化还原循环实现催化剂再生。这一机理突出了催化剂选择性活化C-H键和控制后续氧化步骤的能力的重要性。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。例如，将钒离子隔离在沸石基质内已被证明可以产生高丙烯产率的催化剂。VAPO-5催化剂中的孤立VO4四面体结构被提出作为这一反应的活性位点。这种位点隔离的方法通过控制活性位点的可用性和分布来帮助限制过度氧化。

总之，ODH过程的效率受到催化剂组成和结构、反应机理以及位点隔离程度等因素复杂相互作用的影响。平衡这些因素对于开发能在烷烃ODH中同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂至关重要。
