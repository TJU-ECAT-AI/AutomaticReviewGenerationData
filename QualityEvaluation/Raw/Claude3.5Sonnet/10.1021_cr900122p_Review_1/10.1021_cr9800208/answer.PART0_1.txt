The influence of various preparation methods on the performance of the VNbO catalysts also was investigated by Smits et al.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising route for alkene production, but it faces challenges in achieving both high selectivity and conversion. Various catalysts have been studied for this process, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems.

Mixed metal oxide catalysts, particularly those containing Mo, V, and Nb, have shown superior activity and selectivity compared to single metal oxide catalysts. The Mo16V4Nb2 catalyst, for instance, demonstrated 100% selectivity with 10% conversion at 559 K.

Niobium oxide exhibits very high selectivity in ODH reactions, albeit with low conversion rates. However, its activity can be enhanced without compromising selectivity by incorporating other elements like V, Cr, or Mo. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic effects between different metal species in the catalyst.

The performance of VNbO catalysts is significantly influenced by the preparation methods and the local environment of active sites. Vanadium sites promote activity, while niobium sites enhance selectivity. This interplay between different metal species is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance.

The role of site isolation is evident in the case of niobium, which is more difficult to reduce than vanadium. This property of niobium improves selectivity by preventing over-reduction of the catalyst, which often leads to decreased selectivity in ODH reactions.

The collective influence of these factors on process efficiency is substantial. The choice of catalyst composition, preparation method, and the resulting site isolation all play critical roles in addressing the selectivity-conversion trade-off in ODH reactions. By carefully tuning these parameters, researchers aim to develop catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and conversion, making ODH a more viable process for industrial alkene production.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是生产烯烃的一种有前景的路径，但在实现高选择性和高转化率方面面临挑战。研究人员已经研究了各种催化剂用于这一过程，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型体系。

混合金属氧化物催化剂，特别是含有Mo、V和Nb的催化剂，相比单一金属氧化物催化剂表现出更高的活性和选择性。例如，Mo16V4Nb2催化剂在559 K下展现出100%的选择性和10%的转化率。

铌氧化物在ODH反应中表现出很高的选择性，但转化率较低。然而，通过incorporatedV、Cr或Mo等其他元素，可以提高其活性而不影响选择性。这种改进归因于催化剂中不同金属物种之间的协同效应。

VNbO催化剂的性能受制备方法和活性位点局部环境的显著影响。钒位点促进活性，而铌位点增强选择性。这种不同金属物种之间的相互作用对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

位点隔离的作用在铌的案例中很明显，铌比钒更难被还原。这种特性通过防止催化剂过度还原来改善选择性，而过度还原常常导致ODH反应中选择性的降低。

这些因素对过程效率的综合影响是巨大的。催化剂组成的选择、制备方法以及由此产生的位点隔离都在解决ODH反应中选择性-转化率权衡问题中发挥关键作用。通过仔细调整这些参数，研究人员旨在开发能够同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂，使ODH成为更可行的工业烯烃生产过程。
