[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."

[2] "The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1). Alkenes are primary ODH products while CO and CO2 (COx) can form via either secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes."

[3] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[4] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

[5] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, as secondary combustion of alkenes limits yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes.

The reaction network involves parallel and sequential oxidation steps, with alkenes as primary ODH products and CO/CO2 formed through secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes. The proposed mechanism for propane ODH includes several steps: weak adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen, C-H bond cleavage via H-abstraction, propene desorption, OH group recombination, and reoxidation of reduced metal centers.

Catalyst composition plays a crucial role in ODH efficiency. VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts have been extensively studied, with their performance influenced by reducibility, Lewis acidity, and oxygen mobility. Ideal catalysts for selective ODH should have intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility.

The challenge in achieving high selectivity stems from the fact that CH bond activation in alkane ODH requires the same sites as CH bond activation in alkene combustion. This similarity makes selective poisoning strategies ineffective for improving alkene yields.

Site isolation is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, but it can be inferred that isolating active sites might help address selectivity issues by preventing unwanted secondary reactions. However, the shared requirements for CH bond activation in both desired and undesired reactions make this approach challenging.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by a delicate balance between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. Optimizing these factors collectively is crucial for developing more efficient ODH processes with higher selectivity and conversion.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率，因为烯烃的二次燃烧将丙烷和更高级烷烃的产率限制在约30%。

反应网络涉及并行和连续的氧化步骤，烯烃是主要的ODH产物，而CO/CO2通过烯烃的二次燃烧或烷烃的直接燃烧形成。丙烷ODH的提议机理包括几个步骤：丙烷在晶格氧上的弱吸附、通过H-抽取的C-H键断裂、丙烯脱附、OH基团重组以及还原金属中心的再氧化。

催化剂组成在ODH效率中起着关键作用。VOx-、MoOx-和WOx-基催化剂已被广泛研究，其性能受还原性、路易斯酸性和氧mobility的影响。选择性ODH的理想催化剂应具有中等还原性、弱路易斯酸中心和高氧mobility。

实现高选择性的挑战在于，烷烃ODH中的CH键活化需要与烯烃燃烧中的CH键活化相同的位点。这种相似性使得选择性毒化策略在提高烯烃产率方面无效。

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论位点隔离，但可以推断，隔离活性位点可能有助于解决选择性问题，防止不需要的二次反应。然而，所需反应和不需要反应中CH键活化的共同要求使得这种方法具有挑战性。

总之，ODH过程的效率受到催化剂性质、反应机理和过程条件之间微妙平衡的影响。综合优化这些因素对于开发具有更高选择性和转化率的更高效ODH过程至关重要。
