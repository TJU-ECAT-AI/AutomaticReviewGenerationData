[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."

[2] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

[3] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[4] "The redox properties of oxide catalysts play an important role in determining reaction rates, and the relative CH bond energies in alkanes and alkenes strongly influence alkene yields. The acidbase properties of oxide catalysts, however, can also influence both reaction rates and alkene yields."

[5] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, as secondary combustion of alkene products limits yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes.

Catalyst composition and structure play crucial roles in ODH efficiency. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems, particularly those based on VOx, MoOx, and WOx, have been extensively studied. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their redox properties, acid-base characteristics, and oxygen mobility. Ideal catalysts for ODH should possess intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility.

The proposed reaction mechanism for ODH involves several steps:
1. Weak adsorption of the alkane on lattice oxygen
2. C-H bond activation through hydrogen abstraction
3. Desorption of the alkene
4. Formation of water and a reduced metal center
5. Reoxidation of the metal center

The C-H bond activation step is critical and appears to require the same sites for both alkane ODH and alkene combustion. This similarity in site requirements makes it challenging to selectively inhibit undesired combustion reactions.

The interplay between catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms significantly influences process efficiency. Redox properties of the catalysts affect reaction rates, while the relative C-H bond energies in alkanes and alkenes impact alkene yields. Additionally, the acid-base properties of catalysts influence both rates and yields.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, catalysts can potentially minimize secondary reactions that lead to combustion of desired alkene products. This approach aims to increase the probability of alkene desorption before further oxidation occurs.

In conclusion, improving ODH efficiency requires a delicate balance of catalyst properties and reaction conditions. Future research should focus on developing catalysts with optimized redox properties, acidity, and site isolation to enhance selectivity and conversion simultaneously.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受催化剂和反应机理等多种因素影响的复杂过程。ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率，因为烯烃产物的二次燃烧将丙烷及更高级烷烃的产率限制在约30%。

催化剂的组成和结构在ODH效率中起着关键作用。大量研究集中在块状金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统上，特别是基于VOx、MoOx和WOx的催化剂。这些催化剂的有效性取决于它们的氧化还原性质、酸碱特性和氧移动性。理想的ODH催化剂应具有适中的可还原性、弱Lewis酸中心和高氧移动性。

ODH的proposed反应机理包括几个步骤：
1. 烷烃在晶格氧上的弱吸附
2. 通过氢抽提实现C-H键活化
3. 烯烃的脱附
4. 水的形成和金属中心的还原
5. 金属中心的再氧化

C-H键活化步骤至关重要，并且似乎需要与烯烃燃烧相同的活性位点。这种活性位点需求的相似性使得选择性抑制不需要的燃烧反应变得具有挑战性。

催化剂性质和反应机理之间的相互作用显著影响过程效率。催化剂的氧化还原性质影响反应速率，而烷烃和烯烃中C-H键的相对能量影响烯烃产率。此外，催化剂的酸碱性质同时影响反应速率和产率。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，催化剂可能最大程度地减少导致所需烯烃产物燃烧的二次反应。这种方法旨在增加烯烃在进一步氧化之前脱附的概率。

总之，提高ODH效率需要在催化剂性质和反应条件之间取得微妙的平衡。未来的研究应集中在开发具有优化氧化还原性质、酸度和位点隔离的催化剂，以同时提高选择性和转化率。
