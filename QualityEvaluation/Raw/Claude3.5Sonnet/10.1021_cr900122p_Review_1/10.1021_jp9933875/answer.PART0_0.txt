[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."

[2] "Alkene selectivities decrease markedly as conversion increases."

[3] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

[4] "Initial selectivities greater than 90% can be achieved for many ODH reactions."

[5] "Detailed kinetics and isotopic tracer studies have shown that propane ODH occurs on VOx domains via a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism using lattice oxygen atoms to abstract hydrogen atoms from C3H8 in an irreversible CH bond activation step."

[6] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[7] "The apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this same sequence."

[8] "Activation energies for propane ODH are higher than for propene combustion; this leads to a decrease in k3/k1 ratios as reaction temperature increases."

[9] "Metal oxides having high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1 − ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, as secondary combustion of alkene products limits yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes.

Catalyst composition plays a crucial role in ODH efficiency. The study compares VOx, MoOx, and WOx catalysts supported on ZrO2. VOx/ZrO2 shows the highest activity, followed by MoOx/ZrO2 and WOx/ZrO2. This trend is attributed to the redox properties and Lewis acidity of the metal cations. More reducible cations and higher oxygen basicity lead to higher ODH rates.

The reaction mechanism involves a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle, where lattice oxygen atoms abstract hydrogen from the alkane in an irreversible C-H bond activation step. The process includes:
1. Weak adsorption of alkane on lattice oxygen
2. C-H bond cleavage via H-abstraction
3. Alkene desorption
4. Water formation and catalyst reduction
5. Catalyst reoxidation

The main challenge in achieving high selectivity lies in the fact that C-H bond activation for both alkane ODH and alkene combustion occurs on the same sites. This makes selective poisoning strategies ineffective for improving alkene yields. However, initial selectivities above 90% can be achieved for many ODH reactions.

Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues. The study mentions that the relative abundance of different types of binding sites is influenced by the structure of the metal oxide species. Higher surface densities of VOx and MoOx species lead to an increase in the ratio of dehydrogenation to combustion rates, possibly due to a decrease in M-O-Zr species that favor strong binding of intermediates and direct combustion.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between activation energies for alkane dehydrogenation and alkene combustion. The difference in these activation energies affects the ratio of rate constants for these reactions (k3/k1), which in turn impacts alkene yields. Higher temperatures favor alkene formation due to the higher activation energy for alkane dehydrogenation compared to alkene combustion.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is a result of complex interactions between catalyst properties (redox potential, acidity, oxygen mobility), reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. Optimizing these factors, along with careful control of site isolation, is crucial for developing more selective and efficient ODH catalysts.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率，因为烯烃产物的二次燃烧将丙烷和更高级烷烃的产率限制在约30%。

催化剂组成在ODH效率中起着关键作用。该研究比较了负载在ZrO2上的VOx、MoOx和WOx催化剂。VOx/ZrO2显示出最高的活性，其次是MoOx/ZrO2和WOx/ZrO2。这种趋势归因于金属阳离子的氧化还原性质和路易斯酸性。更易还原的阳离子和更高的氧碱性导致更高的ODH反应速率。

反应机理涉及Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环，其中晶格氧原子在不可逆的C-H键活化步骤中从烷烃中提取氢。该过程包括：
1. 烷烃在晶格氧上的弱吸附
2. 通过H-抽提进行C-H键断裂
3. 烯烃脱附
4. 水的形成和催化剂还原
5. 催化剂再氧化

实现高选择性的主要挑战在于烷烃ODH和烯烃燃烧的C-H键活化发生在相同的位点上。这使得选择性毒化策略在提高烯烃产率方面无效。然而，许多ODH反应的初始选择性可以达到90%以上。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用。研究提到，不同类型结合位点的相对丰度受金属氧化物物种结构的影响。VOx和MoOx物种的表面密度增加导致脱氢速率与燃烧速率比率增加，可能是由于有利于中间体强结合和直接燃烧的M-O-Zr物种减少。

ODH过程的效率受烷烃脱氢和烯烃燃烧活化能之间相互作用的影响。这些活化能的差异影响这些反应速率常数的比率（k3/k1），进而影响烯烃产率。由于烷烃脱氢的活化能高于烯烃燃烧，较高的温度有利于烯烃的形成。

总之，ODH过程的效率是催化剂性质（氧化还原电位、酸性、氧移动性）、反应机理和工艺条件之间复杂相互作用的结果。优化这些因素，并谨慎控制位点隔离，对开发更具选择性和效率的ODH催化剂至关重要。
