[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."

[2] "Alkene selectivities decrease markedly as conversion increases."

[3] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

[4] "Initial selectivities greater than 90% can be achieved for many ODH reactions."

[5] "Detailed kinetics and isotopic tracer studies have shown that propane ODH occurs on VOx domains via a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism using lattice oxygen atoms to abstract hydrogen atoms from C3H8 in an irreversible CH bond activation step."

[6] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[7] "The apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this same sequence."

[8] "Activation energies for propane ODH are higher than for propene combustion; this leads to a decrease in k3/k1 ratios as reaction temperature increases."

[9] "Metal oxides having high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1 − ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, as secondary combustion of alkene products limits yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes.

Catalyst composition plays a crucial role in ODH efficiency. The study compares VOx, MoOx, and WOx catalysts supported on ZrO2. VOx/ZrO2 shows the highest activity, followed by MoOx/ZrO2 and WOx/ZrO2. This trend is attributed to the redox properties and Lewis acidity of the metal cations. More reducible cations and higher oxygen basicity lead to higher ODH rates.

The reaction mechanism involves a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle, where lattice oxygen atoms abstract hydrogen from the alkane in an irreversible C-H bond activation step. The process includes:
1. Weak adsorption of alkane on lattice oxygen
2. C-H bond cleavage via H-abstraction
3. Alkene desorption
4. Water formation and catalyst reduction
5. Catalyst reoxidation

The main challenge in achieving high selectivity lies in the fact that C-H bond activation for both alkane ODH and alkene combustion occurs on the same sites. This makes selective poisoning strategies ineffective for improving alkene yields. However, initial selectivities above 90% can be achieved for many ODH reactions.

Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues. The study mentions that the relative abundance of different types of binding sites is influenced by the structure of the metal oxide species. Higher surface densities of VOx and MoOx species lead to an increase in the ratio of dehydrogenation to combustion rates, possibly due to a decrease in M-O-Zr species that favor strong binding of intermediates and direct combustion.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between activation energies for alkane dehydrogenation and alkene combustion. The difference in these activation energies affects the ratio of rate constants for these reactions (k3/k1), which in turn impacts alkene yields. Higher temperatures favor alkene formation due to the higher activation energy for alkane dehydrogenation compared to alkene combustion.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is a result of complex interactions between catalyst properties (redox potential, acidity, oxygen mobility), reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. Optimizing these factors, along with careful control of site isolation, is crucial for developing more selective and efficient ODH catalysts.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率，因为烯烃产物的二次燃烧将丙烷和更高级烷烃的产率限制在约30%。

催化剂组成在ODH效率中起着关键作用。该研究比较了负载在ZrO2上的VOx、MoOx和WOx催化剂。VOx/ZrO2显示出最高的活性，其次是MoOx/ZrO2和WOx/ZrO2。这种趋势归因于金属阳离子的氧化还原性质和路易斯酸性。更易还原的阳离子和更高的氧碱性导致更高的ODH反应速率。

反应机理涉及Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环，其中晶格氧原子在不可逆的C-H键活化步骤中从烷烃中提取氢。该过程包括：
1. 烷烃在晶格氧上的弱吸附
2. 通过H-抽提进行C-H键断裂
3. 烯烃脱附
4. 水的形成和催化剂还原
5. 催化剂再氧化

实现高选择性的主要挑战在于烷烃ODH和烯烃燃烧的C-H键活化发生在相同的位点上。这使得选择性毒化策略在提高烯烃产率方面无效。然而，许多ODH反应的初始选择性可以达到90%以上。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用。研究提到，不同类型结合位点的相对丰度受金属氧化物物种结构的影响。VOx和MoOx物种的表面密度增加导致脱氢速率与燃烧速率比率增加，可能是由于有利于中间体强结合和直接燃烧的M-O-Zr物种减少。

ODH过程的效率受烷烃脱氢和烯烃燃烧活化能之间相互作用的影响。这些活化能的差异影响这些反应速率常数的比率（k3/k1），进而影响烯烃产率。由于烷烃脱氢的活化能高于烯烃燃烧，较高的温度有利于烯烃的形成。

总之，ODH过程的效率是催化剂性质（氧化还原电位、酸性、氧移动性）、反应机理和工艺条件之间复杂相互作用的结果。优化这些因素，并谨慎控制位点隔离，对开发更具选择性和效率的ODH催化剂至关重要。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, as secondary combustion of alkene products limits yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes.

Catalyst composition and structure play crucial roles in ODH efficiency. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems, particularly those based on VOx, MoOx, and WOx, have been extensively studied. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their redox properties, acid-base characteristics, and oxygen mobility. Ideal catalysts for ODH should possess intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility.

The proposed reaction mechanism for ODH involves several steps:
1. Weak adsorption of the alkane on lattice oxygen
2. C-H bond activation through hydrogen abstraction
3. Desorption of the alkene
4. Formation of water and a reduced metal center
5. Reoxidation of the metal center

The C-H bond activation step is critical and appears to require the same sites for both alkane ODH and alkene combustion. This similarity in site requirements makes it challenging to selectively inhibit undesired combustion reactions.

The interplay between catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms significantly influences process efficiency. Redox properties of the catalysts affect reaction rates, while the relative C-H bond energies in alkanes and alkenes impact alkene yields. Additionally, the acid-base properties of catalysts influence both rates and yields.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, catalysts can potentially minimize secondary reactions that lead to combustion of desired alkene products. This approach aims to increase the probability of alkene desorption before further oxidation occurs.

In conclusion, improving ODH efficiency requires a delicate balance of catalyst properties and reaction conditions. Future research should focus on developing catalysts with optimized redox properties, acidity, and site isolation to enhance selectivity and conversion simultaneously.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受催化剂和反应机理等多种因素影响的复杂过程。ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率，因为烯烃产物的二次燃烧将丙烷及更高级烷烃的产率限制在约30%。

催化剂的组成和结构在ODH效率中起着关键作用。大量研究集中在块状金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统上，特别是基于VOx、MoOx和WOx的催化剂。这些催化剂的有效性取决于它们的氧化还原性质、酸碱特性和氧移动性。理想的ODH催化剂应具有适中的可还原性、弱Lewis酸中心和高氧移动性。

ODH的proposed反应机理包括几个步骤：
1. 烷烃在晶格氧上的弱吸附
2. 通过氢抽提实现C-H键活化
3. 烯烃的脱附
4. 水的形成和金属中心的还原
5. 金属中心的再氧化

C-H键活化步骤至关重要，并且似乎需要与烯烃燃烧相同的活性位点。这种活性位点需求的相似性使得选择性抑制不需要的燃烧反应变得具有挑战性。

催化剂性质和反应机理之间的相互作用显著影响过程效率。催化剂的氧化还原性质影响反应速率，而烷烃和烯烃中C-H键的相对能量影响烯烃产率。此外，催化剂的酸碱性质同时影响反应速率和产率。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，催化剂可能最大程度地减少导致所需烯烃产物燃烧的二次反应。这种方法旨在增加烯烃在进一步氧化之前脱附的概率。

总之，提高ODH效率需要在催化剂性质和反应条件之间取得微妙的平衡。未来的研究应集中在开发具有优化氧化还原性质、酸度和位点隔离的催化剂，以同时提高选择性和转化率。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. The interplay between these factors significantly impacts process efficiency and selectivity.

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH reactions. Vanadium oxide (VOx) based materials are considered among the most active and selective catalysts for ODH. The activity and selectivity of catalysts follow the trend VOx > MoOx > WOx when supported on ZrO2. This trend is attributed to the balance between reducibility, Lewis acidity, and oxygen mobility of the metal oxides.

The reaction mechanism involves several steps, including weak adsorption of the alkane on lattice oxygen, C-H bond activation through hydrogen abstraction, desorption of the alkene, recombination of OH groups, and reoxidation of the reduced metal centers. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation, which is influenced by the reducibility of the metal oxide and the basicity of the lattice oxygen.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH. The main issue is the occurrence of parallel and sequential oxidation steps, where alkenes (the desired products) can undergo further oxidation to form CO and CO2. The relative rates of these reactions, represented by rate constants k1 (primary dehydrogenation), k2 (primary combustion), and k3 (secondary combustion), determine the overall selectivity and yield.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By modifying the catalyst support or adding promoters, the Lewis acidity of the active sites can be decreased. This leads to less favorable adsorption of alkenes, resulting in lower k3/k1 ratios and potentially higher alkene yields. For example, supporting VOx on more basic oxides like MgO instead of acidic supports like Al2O3 or SiO2 can improve alkene yields.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors. Catalyst design aims to optimize the balance between reducibility, acidity, and oxygen mobility to maximize alkene production while minimizing undesired combustion reactions. The choice of support material, metal oxide, and potential promoters all contribute to fine-tuning this balance.

In conclusion, understanding and controlling the complex interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation is crucial for improving the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process. Ongoing research in this field continues to explore new catalyst formulations and reaction conditions to overcome the challenges of achieving high selectivity at commercially viable conversion levels.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。这些因素之间的相互作用显著影响了过程效率和选择性。

催化剂在ODH反应中起着关键作用。钒氧化物（VOx）基材料被认为是ODH最活跃和选择性的催化剂之一。当负载在ZrO2上时，催化剂的活性和选择性遵循VOx > MoOx > WOx的趋势。这种趋势归因于金属氧化物的还原性、Lewis酸性和氧移动性之间的平衡。

反应机理包括几个步骤，包括烷烃在晶格氧上的弱吸附、通过氢抽提的C-H键活化、烯烃的脱附、OH基团的重组以及还原金属中心的再氧化。决定反应速率的步骤是C-H键活化，这受到金属氧化物的还原性和晶格氧的碱性的影响。

在ODH中，同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战。主要问题是平行和连续氧化步骤的发生，其中烯烃（目标产物）可能进一步氧化形成CO和CO2。这些反应的相对速率，由速率常数k1（主要脱氢）、k2（主要燃烧）和k3（二次燃烧）表示，决定了整体选择性和收率。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题上起着关键作用。通过修改催化剂载体或添加助剂，可以降低活性位点的Lewis酸性。这导致烯烃吸附的减少，从而降低k3/k1比率，潜在地提高烯烃收率。例如，将VOx负载在更碱性的氧化物（如MgO）上，而不是酸性载体（如Al2O3或SiO2）上，可以提高烯烃收率。

ODH过程的效率受到这些因素的共同影响。催化剂设计旨在优化还原性、酸性和氧移动性之间的平衡，以最大化烯烃产量，同时最小化不希望的燃烧反应。载体材料、金属氧化物和潜在的助剂的选择都有助于微调这种平衡。

总之，理解和控制催化剂性质、反应机理和位点隔离之间的复杂相互作用对于提高ODH过程的效率和选择性至关重要。该领域的持续研究继续探索新的催化剂配方和反应条件，以克服在商业可行的转化水平上实现高选择性的挑战。
