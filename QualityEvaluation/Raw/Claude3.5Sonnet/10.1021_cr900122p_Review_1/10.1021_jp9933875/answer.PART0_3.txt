[1] "The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1). Alkenes are primary ODH products while CO and CO2 (COx) can form via either secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes."

[2] "VOx-based materials are among the most active and selective oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

[3] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[4] "The kinetics and reaction pathways for propane ODH on VOx-based catalysts have been described in detail previously. The ODH rate is proportional to C3H8 partial pressures and independent of O2 partial pressures when H2O partial pressures are low;"

[5] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[6] "The apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this same sequence."

[7] "A further decrease in the Lewis acidity of the cations in VOx and MoOx by modifications with oxides or supports of moderate or strong basicity (e.g., MgO, Cs2O), which increase the electron density at cation sites, should lead to less favorable adsorption of alkenes (smaller Δ(ΔHads), and to lower ΔE1  ΔE3 and k3/k1 value."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. The interplay between these factors significantly impacts process efficiency and selectivity.

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH reactions. Vanadium oxide (VOx) based materials are considered among the most active and selective catalysts for ODH. The activity and selectivity of catalysts follow the trend VOx > MoOx > WOx when supported on ZrO2. This trend is attributed to the balance between reducibility, Lewis acidity, and oxygen mobility of the metal oxides.

The reaction mechanism involves several steps, including weak adsorption of the alkane on lattice oxygen, C-H bond activation through hydrogen abstraction, desorption of the alkene, recombination of OH groups, and reoxidation of the reduced metal centers. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation, which is influenced by the reducibility of the metal oxide and the basicity of the lattice oxygen.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH. The main issue is the occurrence of parallel and sequential oxidation steps, where alkenes (the desired products) can undergo further oxidation to form CO and CO2. The relative rates of these reactions, represented by rate constants k1 (primary dehydrogenation), k2 (primary combustion), and k3 (secondary combustion), determine the overall selectivity and yield.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By modifying the catalyst support or adding promoters, the Lewis acidity of the active sites can be decreased. This leads to less favorable adsorption of alkenes, resulting in lower k3/k1 ratios and potentially higher alkene yields. For example, supporting VOx on more basic oxides like MgO instead of acidic supports like Al2O3 or SiO2 can improve alkene yields.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors. Catalyst design aims to optimize the balance between reducibility, acidity, and oxygen mobility to maximize alkene production while minimizing undesired combustion reactions. The choice of support material, metal oxide, and potential promoters all contribute to fine-tuning this balance.

In conclusion, understanding and controlling the complex interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation is crucial for improving the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process. Ongoing research in this field continues to explore new catalyst formulations and reaction conditions to overcome the challenges of achieving high selectivity at commercially viable conversion levels.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。这些因素之间的相互作用显著影响了过程效率和选择性。

催化剂在ODH反应中起着关键作用。钒氧化物（VOx）基材料被认为是ODH最活跃和选择性的催化剂之一。当负载在ZrO2上时，催化剂的活性和选择性遵循VOx > MoOx > WOx的趋势。这种趋势归因于金属氧化物的还原性、Lewis酸性和氧移动性之间的平衡。

反应机理包括几个步骤，包括烷烃在晶格氧上的弱吸附、通过氢抽提的C-H键活化、烯烃的脱附、OH基团的重组以及还原金属中心的再氧化。决定反应速率的步骤是C-H键活化，这受到金属氧化物的还原性和晶格氧的碱性的影响。

在ODH中，同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战。主要问题是平行和连续氧化步骤的发生，其中烯烃（目标产物）可能进一步氧化形成CO和CO2。这些反应的相对速率，由速率常数k1（主要脱氢）、k2（主要燃烧）和k3（二次燃烧）表示，决定了整体选择性和收率。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题上起着关键作用。通过修改催化剂载体或添加助剂，可以降低活性位点的Lewis酸性。这导致烯烃吸附的减少，从而降低k3/k1比率，潜在地提高烯烃收率。例如，将VOx负载在更碱性的氧化物（如MgO）上，而不是酸性载体（如Al2O3或SiO2）上，可以提高烯烃收率。

ODH过程的效率受到这些因素的共同影响。催化剂设计旨在优化还原性、酸性和氧移动性之间的平衡，以最大化烯烃产量，同时最小化不希望的燃烧反应。载体材料、金属氧化物和潜在的助剂的选择都有助于微调这种平衡。

总之，理解和控制催化剂性质、反应机理和位点隔离之间的复杂相互作用对于提高ODH过程的效率和选择性至关重要。该领域的持续研究继续探索新的催化剂配方和反应条件，以克服在商业可行的转化水平上实现高选择性的挑战。
