The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, specifically n-butane in this review, involves a complex interplay of various factors that collectively influence process efficiency. 

Catalysts play a crucial role, with both unsupported and supported systems being utilized. Bulk metal oxides and supported catalysts each have their own advantages and challenges in terms of activity and selectivity. The review discusses various catalytic systems, indicating that catalyst composition is a key factor affecting both activity and selectivity.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH. The review mentions several factors that influence these parameters, including catalyst reducibility, oxygen reactivity and availability, nature of oxygen species involved, electrical conductivity of the catalyst, and surface basicity. These factors interact in complex ways to determine the overall catalytic performance.

The proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH typically involve C-H bond activation as a key step. While the review doesn't explicitly mention M-alkyl intermediates or 2H-abstraction, it does discuss the hydrocarbon activation process and reaction mechanisms. The kinetics and mechanism section likely provides more detailed information on these aspects.

Site isolation, although not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, is often an important concept in addressing selectivity issues in ODH reactions. It helps prevent over-oxidation of the desired products by isolating active sites from each other.

The review's focus on the main factors governing catalytic efficiency suggests that understanding and optimizing these various aspects - from catalyst composition and properties to reaction conditions and mechanisms - is crucial for improving the overall efficiency of the ODH process. The interplay between these factors determines the balance between activity and selectivity, which is key to developing commercially viable ODH processes for alkane conversion.
