[1] "The main conclusion of our study is that a good mix of acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products."

[2] "It seems that, inversely, propylene reacts relatively smoothly over catalysts of partial oxidation of propane. Indeed, in this reaction, substantial yields of propylene are generally produced as compared to organic compounds or carbon oxides yields."

[3] "Regarding the partial oxidation of propane to organic compounds, only a few number of studies have been undertaken concerning the nature of the active sites and the role of the lattice oxygen atoms."

[4] "The most important point discussed is the mode of activation of propane, because it determines the reaction rate and also, probably, the reaction selectivities."

[5] "From a practical point of view, it can be said that further improvements of the direct oxidation of propane to organic compounds passes through the improvement of the selective oxidation of propylene intermediate in order to overcome its oxidation to carbon oxides."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. The interplay between acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst surface is crucial for controlling selectivity.

2. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult. Propylene, the desired product, reacts more readily than propane, leading to over-oxidation.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The activation of the C-H bond is considered the rate-determining step. Proposed mechanisms include the formation of M-alkyl intermediates and 2H-abstraction. However, detailed studies on the nature of active sites and the role of lattice oxygen atoms are limited for propane oxidation.

4. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the catalyst's ability to activate propane while minimizing further oxidation of propylene. Improving the selective oxidation of the propylene intermediate is key to enhancing overall process efficiency.

5. Site isolation: While not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, site isolation is an important concept in addressing selectivity issues. It involves designing catalysts where active sites are spatially separated to prevent unwanted consecutive reactions.

The complex interplay of these factors makes the ODH of alkanes a challenging but promising area for research and development in heterogeneous catalysis.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

1. 催化剂组成：使用了体相金属氧化物和负载型系统。催化剂表面的酸碱性和氧化还原性之间的相互作用对控制选择性至关重要。

2. 挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率是困难的。作为目标产物的丙烯比丙烷更容易反应，导致过度氧化。

3. 反应机理：C-H键的活化被认为是决速步骤。提出的机理包括M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提。然而，对于丙烷氧化，关于活性位点性质和晶格氧原子作用的详细研究还很有限。

4. 过程效率：效率受催化剂活化丙烷同时最小化丙烯进一步氧化能力的影响。改善丙烯中间体的选择性氧化是提高整体过程效率的关键。

5. 位点隔离：虽然在给出的引用中没有明确提到，但位点隔离是解决选择性问题的一个重要概念。它涉及设计催化剂，使活性位点在空间上分离，以防止不希望的连续反应。

这些因素的复杂相互作用使得烷烃的ODH成为异相催化领域一个具有挑战性但前景广阔的研究和开发领域。
