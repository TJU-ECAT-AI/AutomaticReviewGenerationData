[1] "The main remark about the results reported above is that the catalytic formulations used for propane selective oxidation are very different from the catalytic formulation used in the selective oxidation of propylene. Particularly, the former generally contains vanadia phases but not the latter."

[2] "The difference of reactivity between propane and propylene is linked to the strengths of the involved C-H bonds and to the stability of the corresponding radicals formed in the rate determining step by H abstraction"

[3] "For Michalakos et al. [35], the propyl radical is formed first and its reactivity determines the reaction selectivities."

[4] "The first step of propylene oxidation is the same, irrespective of the presence or the absence of ammonia and corresponds to the rate determining abstraction of the a-methyl hydrogen to form a w-allyl intermediate."

[5] "The lattice oxygen atoms participate to the propylene oxidation to acrolein or acrylonitrile (see Section 4 and 5) over the different systems used (BiMoO, SbSnO, Cu20 mixed oxides) and the suggested active sites are bridged oxygen atoms M-O-M associated to the Mo=O double bond(s) for the BiMoO catalyst. Isolated sites are believed to give high selectivities [35]."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems are commonly used catalysts, with vanadia phases often present in propane ODH catalysts but not in propylene oxidation catalysts. This difference is due to the lower reactivity of propane compared to propylene, requiring stronger activating phases.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation as the rate-determining step, with the formation of alkyl radicals or intermediates. For propane, the isopropyl radical is believed to form first, while for propylene, the π-allyl intermediate is the initial product.

Lattice oxygen atoms play a crucial role in the oxidation process, with bridged oxygen atoms (M-O-M) and metal-oxygen double bonds (e.g., Mo=O) serving as active sites. The isolation of these sites is believed to enhance selectivity.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the strength of C-H bonds, the stability of formed radicals, and the nature of the catalyst. Balancing the redox and acid-base properties of the catalyst surface is essential for controlling the reaction towards selective products.

Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated active sites are thought to promote higher selectivity by limiting over-oxidation and undesired side reactions. However, achieving the right balance between site isolation and catalytic activity remains a challenge in catalyst design for ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。块状金属氧化物和负载型体系是常用的催化剂，其中钒氧化物相通常存在于丙烷ODH催化剂中，但不存在于丙烯氧化催化剂中。这种差异是由于丙烷比丙烯的反应活性较低，需要更强的活化相。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化作为速率决定步骤，形成烷基自由基或中间体。对于丙烷，异丙基自由基被认为首先形成，而对于丙烯，π-烯丙基中间体是初始产物。

晶格氧原子在氧化过程中起着关键作用，桥接氧原子（M-O-M）和金属-氧双键（如Mo=O）作为活性位点。这些位点的隔离被认为可以提高选择性。

ODH过程的效率受C-H键强度、形成的自由基稳定性以及催化剂性质的影响。平衡催化剂表面的氧化还原和酸碱性质对于控制反应向选择性产物方向进行至关重要。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着重要作用。隔离的活性位点被认为可以通过限制过度氧化和不需要的副反应来提高选择性。然而，在ODH反应的催化剂设计中，实现位点隔离和催化活性之间的正确平衡仍然是一个挑战。
