[1] "The main conclusion of our study is that a good mix of acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products."

[2] "VMgO catalysts where the magnesia phase plays the role of basic centers during the propane partial oxidation to propylene"

[3] "The basic idea of these formulations is that associating known solid phases active for the oxydehydrogenation reaction (ODHR) of propane and known solid phases active for the selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein, modified or not, catalyses the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein"

[4] "Concerning the reaction mechanism, a general agreement in literature is that the rate determining step of the reaction is the breaking of the first C-H bond, leading to a propyl species"

[5] "The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene. This decomposition needs the presence of BrØnsted acid sites"

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides (like VMgO) and supported systems are used. VMgO catalysts contain vanadia phases for oxidizing properties and magnesia for basic properties. Associating phases active for ODH with those active for selective oxidation of olefins is a common approach.

Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult. The main challenge is activating the alkane while avoiding over-oxidation of desired products.

Proposed mechanisms: The rate-determining step is generally considered to be C-H bond activation, forming propyl species. Alkoxy intermediates may also form and decompose to alkenes. Both acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst surface are important.

Site isolation: This concept aims to control selectivity by spatially separating active sites on the catalyst surface. Isolated sites can help avoid consecutive oxidation reactions.

Efficiency: Process efficiency depends on balancing the acid-base and redox properties of the catalyst. A good mix of these properties allows controlled orientation of the reaction toward selective products.

BrØnsted acid sites play a key role in decomposing alkoxy intermediates to alkenes. However, excessive acidity can promote undesired reactions.

Overall, optimizing ODH requires careful catalyst design to balance activation of the alkane, formation of desired intermediates, and controlled oxidation to products while limiting over-oxidation. Site isolation and tuning surface properties are key strategies to address selectivity challenges.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及多种因素之间的复杂相互作用:

催化剂：使用块状金属氧化物(如VMgO)和负载型系统。VMgO催化剂含有氧化性的钒氧化物相和碱性的氧化镁相。将活性用于ODH的相与活性用于烯烃选择性氧化的相相结合是一种常见方法。

挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率很困难。主要挑战是在活化烷烃的同时避免所需产物的过度氧化。

提出的机理：通常认为决速步骤是C-H键活化，形成丙基物种。烷氧基中间体也可能形成并分解为烯烃。催化剂表面的酸碱性和氧化还原性都很重要。

位点隔离：这个概念旨在通过在催化剂表面空间分离活性位点来控制选择性。隔离的位点可以帮助避免连续氧化反应。

效率：过程效率取决于催化剂的酸碱性和氧化还原性的平衡。这些性质的良好组合允许反应受控地朝向选择性产物进行。

Brønsted酸位在将烷氧基中间体分解为烯烃中起关键作用。然而，过度的酸性可能促进不期望的反应。

总的来说，优化ODH需要仔细设计催化剂，以平衡烷烃的活化、所需中间体的形成和受控氧化成产物，同时限制过度氧化。位点隔离和调节表面性质是解决选择性挑战的关键策略。
