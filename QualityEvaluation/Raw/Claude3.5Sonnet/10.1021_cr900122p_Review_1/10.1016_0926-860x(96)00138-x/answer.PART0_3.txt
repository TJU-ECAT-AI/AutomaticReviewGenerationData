[1] "The first one is, as for the partial oxidation of other light alkanes, the lower reactivity of the reactant as compared to that of the formed products. Activation of the reactant needs operating conditions (temperature as high as 500C for example) which are detrimental to the stability of the product."

[2] "VMgO catalysts [134-142] which is reported to give the best performance (typically 60% of propane selectivity at 15% of propane conversion)"

[3] "According to Volta et al. [138,139] vanadium occupies isolated tetrahedral VO4 sites in Mg3V208, VO6 octahedra linked through edges in a-MgV206 and V207 units consisting of pairs of corner-sharing VO4 tetrahedra in c-MgV207. The obtained order of reactivity and selectivity for the phases were: c-MgzV207 > MgV206 > Mg3V208."

[4] "Concerning the reaction mechanism, a general agreement in literature is that the rate determining step of the reaction is the breaking of the first C-H bond, leading to a propyl species [32,156,157]. Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step."

[5] "Isolated sites are believed to give high selectivities [35]."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The main difficulty lies in the lower reactivity of alkanes compared to the products formed, requiring higher temperatures that can lead to undesired side reactions and product degradation.

Various catalysts have been studied for ODH, with VMgO systems showing promising results (60% propylene selectivity at 15% propane conversion). The catalyst structure and composition play a crucial role in determining activity and selectivity. For example, in VMgO catalysts, the c-MgV207 phase shows the highest reactivity and selectivity compared to other phases.

The proposed reaction mechanism generally involves C-H bond activation as the rate-determining step, leading to the formation of propyl species. The activity of these propyl intermediates is thought to influence the selectivity of the reaction. 

Site isolation is an important factor in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated sites, such as isolated tetrahedral VO4 units in VMgO catalysts, are believed to promote higher selectivities by limiting consecutive reactions that can lead to overoxidation.

The interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions collectively influences the process efficiency. Balancing the redox properties and acid-base characteristics of the catalyst surface is crucial for optimizing selectivity and conversion. Future improvements in ODH catalysts will likely focus on designing materials with well-defined, isolated active sites and tailored surface properties to enhance selectivity while maintaining high activity.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）在同时实现高选择性和高转化率方面面临着几个挑战。主要困难在于烷烃的反应活性比生成的产物低，需要更高的温度，这可能导致不希望的副反应和产物降解。

研究人员已经研究了多种ODH催化剂，其中VMgO系统显示出有希望的结果（在15%的丙烷转化率下，丙烯选择性达到60%）。催化剂的结构和组成在决定活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。例如，在VMgO催化剂中，c-MgV207相比其他相显示出最高的反应活性和选择性。

提出的反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化作为决速步骤，导致丙基物种的形成。这些丙基中间体的活性被认为影响反应的选择性。

位点隔离是解决选择性问题的一个重要因素。孤立的位点，如VMgO催化剂中的孤立四面体VO4单元，被认为能促进更高的选择性，因为它们限制了可能导致过度氧化的连续反应。

催化剂组成、结构和反应条件之间的相互作用共同影响过程效率。平衡催化剂表面的氧化还原性质和酸碱特性对于优化选择性和转化率至关重要。未来ODH催化剂的改进可能会集中在设计具有明确定义的孤立活性位点和定制表面性质的材料上，以提高选择性的同时保持高活性。
