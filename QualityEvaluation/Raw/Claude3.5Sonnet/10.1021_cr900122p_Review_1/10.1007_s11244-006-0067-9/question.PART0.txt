M2-type phases M3TeO10 (M = Mo and V), belonging to the MoVNbTe-oxide system, were prepared by substituting to
various degrees the M-metal with W, Ti, Nb or Fe, and Te with Ce. The compositions were characterized by BET, XRD and XPS
and were studied for propene ammoxidation. The variations of the unit cell parameters with substitution reveal that the
orthorhombic, pseudo-hexagonal M2 structure is preserved to different degrees depending on the substituent and its amount. It is
noted that partial substitution with W, Ti, Ce and Fe all increase the activity of the base composition and that Ce, and especially W,
improve the selectivity to acrylonitrile at the expense of acrolein. The results of the activity measurements and the XPS
investigation indicate that the site, activating propene and ammonia on the unsubstituted M2 phase is a surface ensemble of Mo
and Te. W and Ce were found to be able to mimic the role of Mo and Te, respectively; W mainly via site isolation and electronic
effects, Ce via redox effects. V- and Ti-sites are shown to be inactive, having merely the role of structure adjusting elements, and
serving as templates to complex the excess Te on the surface.

1. Introduction
The MoVNbTe-oxide system is a highly promis-
ing catalyst system for propane oxidation and ammox-
idation to acrylic acid and acrylonitrile, respectively
[13]. Presently, it is well established that this catalyst
system consists of two orthorhombic phases, which are
termed M1 and M2 (pseudo-hexagonal) [48]. In our
previous work on the MoVNbTe-oxide system for
propane ammoxidation [9], we have shown that acry-
lonitrile is formed from propane via intermediate pro-
pene. Of the two phases, the M1 phase is able not only
to activate and convert propane into propene, but can
also convert the propene formed into acrylonitrile
[10, 11]. In difference to M1, M2 does not have the
functionalities for activating propane but is able to
convert propene into acrylonitrile [9, 10]. Moreover, the
M2 phase is more selective than M1 for acrylonitrile
formation from propene. Selectivities for propene am-
moxidation up to 60% and 80%, respectively, have been
reported for the pure M1 and M2 phases [10]. With an
optimal relationship between M1 and M2 in the cata-
lyst, yields of acrylonitrile from propane up to 62% have
been reported [1, 2, 7]. In agreement with these findings,
we observed, compared with compacted lm-sized par-
ticles of the pure M1 phase, a significant increase in the
yield and the selectivity to acrylonitrile when using a
compacted mixture of lm-sized particles of M1 and M2
(symbiosis) [10]. The effect of M2 on the selectivity
became more pronounced as the conversion of propane
was increased, showing that the propene formed on M1
readsorbs on M2, where it reacts to give acrylonitrile.
The M1 phase has been reported to have the com-
position Mo7.8V1.2NbTe0.937O28.9 (Pba2; a = 21.134 A
 ;
b = 26.658 A
 ; c = 4.0146 A
 ; Z = 4) [12]. The M2
phase was likewise shown to have the composition
Mo4.31V1.36Nb0.33Te1.81O19.81 (Pmm2; a = 12.6294 A
 ;
b = 7.29156 A
 ; c = 4.02010 A
 ; Z = 4) [12], with a
structure similar to that of KW3O9 [13], and with Te
placed in the hexagonal channels. Besides the structural
differences between M1 and M2, the latter phase has
been reported to have no propane activating V5
+ sites in
the structure, but only V4
+ sites [11].
However, the performance of the MoVNbTe-oxide
catalyst system still has to be improved before it can be
used on commercial scale. Improvement can be made by
optimizing the crystallite sizes and habits of the constit-
uent M1 and M2 phases and their mixing ratio. Another
option is to make substitutions in either or both phases.
The aim of this publication is to study the catalytic and
structural effects of substitutions in the M2 phase for its
performance in converting propene to acrylonitrile.
Tuning of the composition of the M2 phase is of interest
not only as M2 together with M1 being components in
propane (amm)oxidation catalysts, but also because
M2 on its own right being a candidate catalyst for propene
ammoxidation.

replacement metals were selected considering their
valence, coordination and size, which should match those
of the replaced metals. Catalysts were prepared starting
from
the
basic
M2
composition
TeOM3O9
with
M = (Mo, V), having a KW3O9-type of structure [13],
and substituting to different levels W, Ti, Fe, Nb and Te
for Mo and V, and Ce for Te. The catalysts have been
examined with BET, XRD, XPS and activity measure-
ments in order to determine the success of the substitu-
tion.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared using the precursor method
[1,2]. The precursors to the orthorhombic (pseudo-hex-
agonal)
phase
were
prepared
from
(NH4)6Mo7O244H2O, NH4VO3, H6TeO6, Nb2O56H2O,
(NH4)6W12(OH)2O38,
TiO2,
Fe(NO3)39H2O
and
Ce(NO3)36H2O in desired amounts, which were dis-
solved in water at 60 C. Each batch consisted of metal
salts corresponding to 5 g of metals in 20 mL of water.
The water of the prepared solutions was then allowed to
evaporate in an oven equipped with forced air circula-
tion, where the samples were kept for 4 h at an ambient
temperature of 150 C. The obtained precursors were
then calcined in two steps in order to give the correct
phase. In the first step, the precursors were calcined in
air at 275 C for 2 h and then in the subsequent step, for
another 2 h under a flow of argon in a quartz reactor at
550 C.
Pure unsubstituted M2 was prepared according to the
formula
Mo49V26Te25O250
(denoted
M2-b),
corre-
sponding
to
25
TeOM3O9
formula
units
with
M = (Mo, V) in octahedral positions and with Te filling
up the hexagonal channels. A catalyst termed M2-a was
prepared having the composition Mo47V25Te28O250, or
Mo47Te3V25Te25O250, with some of the M-metal posi-
tions probably being occupied by Te. This sample has
been used as a reference sample, in which further sub-
stitution was made.
Starting from the composition Mo47V25Te28O250
several series were prepared with nominal substitution
of W for Mo, Ti and Fe for V, Ce for Te and Nb for
Mo, V or both. Substitutions with W were prepared
corresponding to 30%, 50%, 70% and 100% replace-
ment of Mo by W. The samples in this series are denoted
MW-yy where yy is the percentage of replacement.
Similar series of samples were prepared with replace-
ment of V by Ti and Te by Ce, which are denoted VT-yy
and TC-yy, respectively. One catalyst with 20% of the V
being replaced by Fe was prepared (VF-20). Four
samples with substitution of Nb for Mo and V were
prepared, which are denoted MN-30, VN-30, MVN-8-
15 and MVN-14-25. In the first two samples Nb,
respectively, has replaced 30% of Mo and 30% of V. In
the MVN-uu-zz samples, Nb has been substituted for
uu% and zz% of the Mo and the V, respectively. The
notations used for the prepared samples are given in
table 1 together with the metal composition in at. %. In
the table is also indicated the phase purity of the prep-
arations as determined by XRD. Only the preparations
that are single phase or almost single phase were used in
the activity measurements after being sieved to give a
250- to 425-lm fraction of particles.
2.2. Activity measurements
The prepared catalysts were tested for ammoxidation
of propene. The experiments were performed at atmo-
spheric pressure and isothermal conditions using a plug-
flow micro-reactor made of stainless steel. The catalyst
load was 0.502.50 g. The reactant flow of oxygen,
ammonia, propene and argon was varied between 10.2
and 23.1 N cm3/min, and the reaction temperature was
set to 400 C. To improve the temperature control of the
reactor, it was embedded in an aluminum block and
placed in a tube furnace. Propene, acrylonitrile, aceto-
nitrile, acrolein and CO2 were analyzed online using a
gas chromatograph, which was equipped with an FID
detector, a TCD detector and a Haysep Q column. CO
was analyzed online with an IR instrument (Rosemount
Binos 100). The exit line from the reactor to the gas
chromatograph was kept at 200C.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
All fresh catalysts were examined by X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) on a Seifert XRD 3000 TT diffrac-
tometer using Ni-filtered Cu Ka radiation. The instru-
ment was calibrated using a silicon standard. The unit
