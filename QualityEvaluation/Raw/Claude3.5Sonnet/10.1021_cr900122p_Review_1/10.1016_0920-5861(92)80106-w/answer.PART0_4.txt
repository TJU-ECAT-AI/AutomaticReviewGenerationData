[1] "The main aspects of the new reaction of direct (one-stage) propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN) are analyzed with reference to the development of the catalysts for this reaction, the main technological options for the process and relationship with reaction conditions, the reaction network and kinetics of the reaction."

[2] "V-Al-antimonate based mixed oxides are promising catalytic systems for the selective formation of ACN from propane in the absence of gas-phase additives"

[3] "ACN forms through the intermediate formation of propylene and the factor controlling the selectivity to ACN is the rate of the reaction for the formation of ACN from the intermediate propylene (rate which critically depends on the availability of ammonia on the catalyst surface)"

[4] "Ga-antimonates (pure or modified with W, Ni and P) have been studied mainly by Osipova and Sokolovski [5] and show several structural and reactivity analogies to the V-antimonate based system."

[5] "Bi-V-molybdate based catalysts have been studied by Moro-oka et al. [6] and similar compositions have been patented by BP/Sohio [3]. These catalysts are selective to acrylonitrile mainly using high propane and ammonia concentrations and results suggest that they catalyze the step from propylene to acrylonitrile, whereas the first step from propane to propylene occurs in the homogeneous gas phase."

[6] "A very selective activation of propane to propylene occurs (selectivities higher than 80%), whereas direct ACN synthesis from propane is of secondary importance. ACN forms mainly from the intermediate propylene, but the contemporaneous presence of propylene and ACN is observed over the entire range of propane conversion."

The document does not specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) or the factors mentioned in the question. Instead, it focuses on propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (ACN). However, some aspects of the process described are relevant to the question:

The document discusses various catalysts for propane conversion to ACN, including V-Al-antimonate, Ga-antimonates, and Bi-V-molybdate based systems. These catalysts show different selectivities and mechanisms for the reaction.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion is a challenge in this process. The document mentions that selectivities to ACN of about 60% can be obtained for propane conversions around 40-50%. Higher conversions lead to consecutive oxidation to carbon oxides, reducing selectivity.

The reaction mechanism involves a two-step process: first, propane is selectively activated to propylene, then propylene is converted to ACN. The rate-limiting step appears to be the conversion of propylene to ACN.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by factors such as catalyst composition, reaction conditions (temperature, reagent ratios), and reactor design. The document suggests that optimizing these factors could improve selectivity and yield.

While site isolation is not explicitly discussed, the document mentions that the rate of ACN formation depends critically on the availability of ammonia on the catalyst surface, suggesting that surface properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in selectivity.

Overall, while this document doesn't directly address ODH of alkanes, it provides insights into similar challenges and considerations in alkane activation and selective oxidation processes.

该文档并未具体讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)或问题中提到的因素。相反，它主要关注丙烷氨氧化制丙烯腈(ACN)。然而，所描述的过程的某些方面与问题相关：

文档讨论了丙烷转化为ACN的各种催化剂，包括V-Al-锑酸盐、Ga-锑酸盐和Bi-V-钼酸盐基系统。这些催化剂对反应表现出不同的选择性和机理。

在这个过程中，实现高选择性和高转化率是一个挑战。文档提到，在丙烷转化率约为40-50%时，可以获得约60%的ACN选择性。更高的转化率会导致连续氧化生成碳氧化物，从而降低选择性。

反应机理涉及两个步骤：首先，丙烷被选择性地活化为丙烯，然后丙烯转化为ACN。限速步骤似乎是丙烯到ACN的转化。

过程效率受到诸如催化剂组成、反应条件（温度、反应物比例）和反应器设计等因素的影响。文档建议，优化这些因素可以提高选择性和产率。

虽然没有明确讨论位点隔离，但文档提到ACN的生成速率严重依赖于催化剂表面氨的可用性，这表明催化剂的表面性质在选择性中起着关键作用。

总的来说，尽管这份文档没有直接涉及烷烃的ODH，但它提供了关于烷烃活化和选择性氧化过程中类似挑战和考虑因素的见解。
