          "Propane is primarily converted to propene, but reasonably a route of direct conversion to carbon oxides also exist."

"The main route of propane conversion is through the formation of propene as the intermediate, although a side reaction of acrylate formation via propionate intermediate is possible."

"Vanadium ions play two main catalytic roles in the mechanism of synthesis of acrylonitrile on V-Sb-oxide: (i) they constitute the active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and (ii) catalyze the reoxidation of surface Sb-sites reduced in the propene to acrylonitrile conversion."

"The active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."

"Although specific data are not available, it is probable that non-stoichiometric properties of vanadium antimonate influence coordination and valence of surface vanadium ions and thus their activity."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. The main challenges include achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously.

Catalysts: V-Sb-oxide catalysts play a crucial role, with vanadium being key for propane activation. The active phase is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with supported Sb5+-oxide. The Sb:V ratio significantly impacts selectivity.

Reaction mechanisms: The primary route involves C-H bond activation to form an alkene intermediate (e.g., propene from propane). Vanadium ions serve dual roles: (1) active sites for propane ODH to propene, and (2) catalyzing the reoxidation of reduced Sb-sites. Multiple pathways exist, including direct conversion to carbon oxides and formation of other intermediates like propionate.

Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion is difficult due to competing reaction pathways. Controlling surface chemistry through catalyst composition and reaction conditions is crucial for improving selectivity.

Site isolation: While not explicitly mentioned, the importance of non-stoichiometry and supported oxide species suggests that controlling the distribution and environment of active sites is critical for catalyst performance.

Process efficiency: The interplay between bulk and surface properties, reaction conditions, and feed composition collectively determine the ODH process efficiency on these catalysts.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及催化剂、反应机理和工艺条件之间的复杂相互作用。主要挑战包括同时实现高选择性和高转化率。

催化剂：V-Sb氧化物催化剂起着关键作用，其中钒是丙烷活化的关键。活性相是非化学计量的金红石型钒锑酸盐，上面负载有Sb5+氧化物。Sb:V比例显著影响选择性。

反应机理：主要路径涉及C-H键活化形成烯烃中间体（例如，丙烷生成丙烯）。钒离子具有双重作用：(1)作为丙烷ODH生成丙烯的活性位点，(2)催化还原的Sb位点的再氧化。存在多种反应途径，包括直接转化为碳氧化物和形成其他中间体如丙酸盐。

挑战：由于存在竞争性反应途径，实现高选择性和高转化率具有难度。通过催化剂组成和反应条件控制表面化学是提高选择性的关键。

位点隔离：虽然没有明确提及，但非化学计量性和负载氧化物物种的重要性表明，控制活性位点的分布和环境对催化剂性能至关重要。

过程效率：体相和表面性质之间的相互作用、反应条件和进料组成共同决定了这些催化剂上ODH过程的效率。
