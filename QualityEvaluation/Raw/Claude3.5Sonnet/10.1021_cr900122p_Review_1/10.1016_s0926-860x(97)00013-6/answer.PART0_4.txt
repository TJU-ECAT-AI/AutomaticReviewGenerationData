[1] "The first pathway of reaction is responsible for a degradative pathway, because acetone further transforms to an acetate species with carbon chain breakage."

[2] "Propane is primarily converted to propene, but reasonably a route of direct conversion to carbon oxides also exist."

[3] "The first reaction occurs preferentially at lower temperatures and in the presence of hydroxyl groups. When their reactivity is blocked by the faster reaction with ammonia, the second pathway of reaction becomes preferential."

[4] "Vanadium ions play two main catalytic roles in the mechanism of synthesis of acrylonitrile on V-Sb-oxide: (i) they constitute the active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and (ii) catalyze the reoxidation of surface Sb-sites reduced in the propene to acrylonitrile conversion."

[5] "Although specific data are not available, it is probable that non-stoichiometric properties of vanadium antimonate influence coordination and valence of surface vanadium ions and thus their activity."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. 

Based on the literature, vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts play a key role in the ODH of propane to propene, which is an important step in the production of acrylonitrile. The vanadium ions serve as active sites for this oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. However, the process faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion.

Multiple reaction pathways exist, including the desired ODH route and undesired routes leading to carbon oxides or acetone (which further degrades). The selectivity depends on factors such as temperature, presence of hydroxyl groups, and ammonia concentration. At lower temperatures and with hydroxyl groups present, a degradative pathway via acetone formation is favored. However, when ammonia blocks these sites, a more selective pathway becomes dominant.

The literature suggests that the non-stoichiometric properties of the vanadium antimonate catalyst influence the coordination and valence of surface vanadium ions, affecting their activity. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition and structure in determining process efficiency.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The presence of antimony in the catalyst helps to isolate vanadium sites, limiting undesired side reactions. This is evidenced by the dual role of vanadium ions: they not only catalyze the ODH of propane to propene but also facilitate the reoxidation of surface antimony sites, which are involved in the subsequent conversion of propene to acrylonitrile.

The reaction mechanisms proposed include C-H bond activation, likely involving Lewis acid sites associated with coordinatively unsaturated vanadium ions. While not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, the literature alludes to multiple mechanisms of alkane activation, which could include the formation of M-alkyl intermediates and 2H-abstraction processes.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the various reaction pathways available. Optimizing these factors, particularly through careful catalyst design and control of reaction conditions, is key to improving selectivity and conversion in the ODH of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。

根据文献，钒-锑氧化物催化剂在丙烷到丙烯的ODH中起关键作用，这是丙烯腈生产的重要一步。钒离子作为这种氧化脱氢反应的活性位点。然而，该过程在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临挑战。

存在多种反应途径，包括所需的ODH路径和不需要的导致碳氧化物或丙酮（进一步降解）的路径。选择性取决于温度、羟基的存在和氨浓度等因素。在较低的温度和存在羟基的情况下，通过丙酮形成的降解途径更有利。然而，当氨阻断这些位点时，一个更具选择性的途径就变得占主导地位。

文献表明，钒锑酸盐催化剂的非化学计量性质影响表面钒离子的配位和价态，从而影响其活性。这突出了催化剂组成和结构在决定过程效率中的重要性。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。催化剂中锑的存在有助于隔离钒位点，限制不需要的副反应。这从钒离子的双重作用得到证实：它们不仅催化丙烷到丙烯的ODH，还促进表面锑位点的再氧化，这些位点参与随后的丙烯到丙烯腈的转化。

提出的反应机理包括C-H键活化，可能涉及与配位不饱和钒离子相关的路易斯酸位点。虽然在给出的引文中没有明确提到，但文献暗示了多种烷烃活化机制，可能包括M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提过程。

总之，ODH过程的效率受到催化剂组成、反应条件和各种可用反应途径之间相互作用的共同影响。优化这些因素，特别是通过仔细的催化剂设计和反应条件控制，是提高烷烃ODH选择性和转化率的关键。
