[1] "Propane is primarily converted to propene, but reasonably a route of direct conversion to carbon oxides also exist."

[2] "The two pathways of conversion of chemisorbed propene are to (i) acetone via isopropoxylate intermediate and (ii) acrolein via allyl alcoholate intermediate."

[3] "Vanadium ions play two main catalytic roles in the mechanism of synthesis of acrylonitrile on V-Sb-oxide: (i) they constitute the active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and (ii) catalyze the reoxidation of surface Sb-sites reduced in the propene to acrylonitrile conversion."

[4] "The active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."

[5] "Ammonia chemisorption, however, selectively inhibits one of the two routes and favors the pathway through intermediate propene formation."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) on V-Sb-oxide catalysts involves a complex interplay of factors that influence process efficiency and selectivity. 

The active phase for selective acrylonitrile synthesis is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with supported Sb5+-oxide. Vanadium ions play dual roles: they are active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene, and they catalyze the reoxidation of reduced Sb-sites during propene to acrylonitrile conversion.

The reaction mechanism involves multiple pathways. Propane is primarily converted to propene, with a possible direct route to carbon oxides. Chemisorbed propene can then follow two main pathways: to acetone via an isopropoxylate intermediate, or to acrolein via an allyl alcoholate intermediate.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion is challenging due to competing reaction pathways. Ammonia chemisorption plays a crucial role in modifying surface reactivity and favoring the selective pathway through propene formation. This suggests that controlling surface chemistry through adsorbed species can help address selectivity issues.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss site isolation, the importance of non-stoichiometry and supported oxide species suggests that controlling the distribution and environment of active sites is critical for improving catalyst performance. The complex interplay between bulk and surface properties, as well as the influence of reaction conditions and feed composition, collectively determine the efficiency of the ODH process on these catalysts.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)在V-Sb氧化物催化剂上涉及多种因素的复杂相互作用,这些因素影响过程效率和选择性。

丙烯腈选择性合成的活性相是非化学计量的金红石型钒锑酸盐,其上负载有Sb5+氧化物。钒离子发挥双重作用:它们是丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的活性位点,并且催化丙烯转化为丙烯腈过程中还原的Sb位点的再氧化。

反应机理涉及多个途径。丙烷主要转化为丙烯,可能还存在直接生成碳氧化物的途径。化学吸附的丙烯可以沿两个主要途径反应:通过异丙氧基中间体生成丙酮,或通过烯丙醇中间体生成丙烯醛。

由于存在竞争性反应途径,实现高选择性和高转化率具有挑战性。氨的化学吸附在改变表面反应性和有利于通过丙烯形成的选择性途径方面起着关键作用。这表明通过吸附物种控制表面化学可以帮助解决选择性问题。

虽然文献没有明确讨论位点隔离,但非化学计量性和负载氧化物物种的重要性表明,控制活性位点的分布和环境对改善催化剂性能至关重要。体相和表面性质之间的复杂相互作用,以及反应条件和进料组成的影响,共同决定了这些催化剂上ODH过程的效率。
