The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. While the provided literature focuses on propane ammoxidation rather than ODH specifically, some insights can be drawn and applied to the broader context of alkane activation.

In ODH, as with propane ammoxidation, the main challenge lies in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The literature suggests that propane is primarily converted to propene as an intermediate, with side reactions leading to undesired products like carbon oxides. This highlights the difficulty in controlling reaction pathways to maximize desired products.

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH processes. The literature discusses V-Sb-oxide catalysts, which contain both bulk metal oxides and supported species. These catalysts exhibit multifunctional properties, with different vanadium species playing contrasting roles in the reaction mechanism. This complexity is likely mirrored in ODH catalysts, where the interplay between various active sites can significantly influence selectivity and conversion.

Reaction mechanisms in ODH typically involve C-H bond activation, which is also a key step in propane ammoxidation. The literature mentions competitive routes for alkane activation, suggesting that similar competing pathways may exist in ODH. These could include direct H-abstraction by strong Lewis acid sites or a two-step process involving basic oxygens and redox surface sites.

Site isolation is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, but it is an important concept in addressing selectivity issues in ODH. By isolating active sites, catalysts can potentially limit undesired side reactions and improve selectivity towards the target product.

The literature emphasizes the need for a better understanding of various factors influencing catalyst performance to design improved catalysts. This applies equally to ODH, where optimizing catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions is crucial for enhancing process efficiency.

In conclusion, while the provided literature does not directly address ODH, it offers valuable insights into the challenges and complexities involved in alkane activation. The interplay between catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions in ODH requires careful consideration and optimization to achieve high selectivity and conversion, mirroring the challenges faced in propane ammoxidation.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。虽然提供的文献主要集中在丙烷氨氧化而不是ODH，但我们可以从中获得一些见解并将其应用于更广泛的烷烃活化背景。

在ODH中，与丙烷氨氧化一样，主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。文献表明，丙烷主要转化为中间体丙烯，同时伴随着生成一氧化碳等不需要产物的副反应。这凸显了控制反应途径以最大化所需产物的难度。

催化剂在ODH过程中起着至关重要的作用。文献讨论了V-Sb氧化物催化剂，其中包含体相金属氧化物和负载物种。这些催化剂表现出多功能性，不同的钒物种在反应机理中扮演着相互矛盾的角色。这种复杂性可能在ODH催化剂中得到体现，其中各种活性位点之间的相互作用可以显著影响选择性和转化率。

ODH的反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化，这也是丙烷氨氧化的关键步骤。文献提到了烷烃活化的竞争性路径，这表明ODH中可能存在类似的竞争途径。这些可能包括强Lewis酸位点的直接H抽取，或涉及碱性氧和氧化还原表面位点的两步过程。

文献中没有明确讨论位点隔离，但这是解决ODH选择性问题的重要概念。通过隔离活性位点，催化剂可能限制不需要的副反应，提高目标产物的选择性。

文献强调需要更好地理解影响催化剂性能的各种因素，以设计改进的催化剂。这同样适用于ODH，其中优化催化剂组成、结构和反应条件对提高过程效率至关重要。

总之，虽然提供的文献没有直接讨论ODH，但它为理解烷烃活化中涉及的挑战和复杂性提供了有价值的见解。ODH中催化剂、反应机理和工艺条件之间的相互作用需要仔细考虑和优化，以实现高选择性和转化率，这与丙烷氨氧化面临的挑战相似。

[4] "The active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) on V-Sb-oxide catalysts involves a complex interplay of factors that influence process efficiency and selectivity. 

The active phase for selective acrylonitrile synthesis is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with supported Sb5+-oxide. Vanadium ions play dual roles: they are active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene, and they catalyze the reoxidation of reduced Sb-sites during propene to acrylonitrile conversion.

The reaction mechanism involves multiple pathways. Propane is primarily converted to propene, with a possible direct route to carbon oxides. Chemisorbed propene can then follow two main pathways: to acetone via an isopropoxylate intermediate, or to acrolein via an allyl alcoholate intermediate.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion is challenging due to competing reaction pathways. Ammonia chemisorption plays a crucial role in modifying surface reactivity and favoring the selective pathway through propene formation. This suggests that controlling surface chemistry through adsorbed species can help address selectivity issues.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss site isolation, the importance of non-stoichiometry and supported oxide species suggests that controlling the distribution and environment of active sites is critical for improving catalyst performance. The complex interplay between bulk and surface properties, as well as the influence of reaction conditions and feed composition, collectively determine the efficiency of the ODH process on these catalysts.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)在V-Sb氧化物催化剂上涉及多种因素的复杂相互作用,这些因素影响过程效率和选择性。

丙烯腈选择性合成的活性相是非化学计量的金红石型钒锑酸盐,其上负载有Sb5+氧化物。钒离子发挥双重作用:它们是丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的活性位点,并且催化丙烯转化为丙烯腈过程中还原的Sb位点的再氧化。

反应机理涉及多个途径。丙烷主要转化为丙烯,可能还存在直接生成碳氧化物的途径。化学吸附的丙烯可以沿两个主要途径反应:通过异丙氧基中间体生成丙酮,或通过烯丙醇中间体生成丙烯醛。

由于存在竞争性反应途径,实现高选择性和高转化率具有挑战性。氨的化学吸附在改变表面反应性和有利于通过丙烯形成的选择性途径方面起着关键作用。这表明通过吸附物种控制表面化学可以帮助解决选择性问题。

虽然文献没有明确讨论位点隔离,但非化学计量性和负载氧化物物种的重要性表明,控制活性位点的分布和环境对改善催化剂性能至关重要。体相和表面性质之间的复杂相互作用,以及反应条件和进料组成的影响,共同决定了这些催化剂上ODH过程的效率。

[1] "The common feature of these two classes of catalysts is the presence of (i) vanadium as the key component for the activity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene [15] and (ii) a mixed oxide matrix known to be selective in propene ammoxidation to acrylonitrile [16,17]."

[2] "For example, the second step usually occurs at much lower temperatures than the first step, due to the easier activation of the alkene molecule in comparison with alkane."

[3] "The apparent critical step is thus transformation of the propene intermediate to acrylonitrile, differently from that expected on the basis of the reactivity of the single hydrocarbons (propane and propene)."

[4] "Propane is primarily converted to propene, but reasonably a route of direct conversion to carbon oxides also exist."

[5] "In particular, IR data on propene+NH3 coadsorption indicate that the route leading to carbon chain breakage and acetonitrile formation is inhibited when Brønsted sites react with ammonia."

[6] "Although not the only explanation, this interpretation can explain one of the key catalytic aspects of the reaction of propane ammoxidation over V-Sb-oxide catalysts, i.e. that good selectivities to acrylonitrile can be obtained only at relatively low propane conversion and increasing conversion selectivity to acrylonitrile decreases with a parallel increase of carbon oxides formation"

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between catalysts, reaction conditions, and mechanisms to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Based on the literature provided, which focuses on propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile, we can draw some parallels to ODH:

1. Catalyst composition: The catalysts typically contain vanadium as a key component for propane activation, along with other elements to promote selectivity. This suggests that in ODH, a similar approach of combining active components for alkane activation with selective components may be beneficial.

2. Challenges in selectivity and conversion: The literature highlights the difficulty in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is a common challenge in ODH as well, where increasing conversion often leads to decreased selectivity due to over-oxidation.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The process involves initial alkane activation (likely through C-H bond activation) to form an alkene intermediate, followed by further transformation. In ODH, the process would stop at the alkene stage, but the challenges of initial C-H bond activation are similar.

4. Competitive pathways: The literature mentions routes for direct conversion to carbon oxides, which is a major challenge in ODH as well. Controlling these pathways is crucial for improving selectivity.

5. Role of catalyst acidity: The literature suggests that Brønsted acidity can lead to undesired side reactions. In ODH, controlling surface acidity is also important to prevent unwanted reactions.

6. Site isolation: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, the concept of site isolation is implied in the discussion of selective catalysts. In ODH, site isolation of active centers can help prevent over-oxidation and improve selectivity.

7. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the balance between alkane activation, selective oxidation, and prevention of over-oxidation. This balance is crucial in ODH as well.

In conclusion, the ODH of alkanes faces similar challenges to propane ammoxidation in terms of balancing activity and selectivity. The key to improving the process lies in careful catalyst design, understanding and controlling reaction mechanisms, and optimizing reaction conditions to favor the desired pathway while suppressing undesired side reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. 

Based on the literature, vanadium-antimony oxide catalysts play a key role in the ODH of propane to propene, which is an important step in the production of acrylonitrile. The vanadium ions serve as active sites for this oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. However, the process faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion.

Multiple reaction pathways exist, including the desired ODH route and undesired routes leading to carbon oxides or acetone (which further degrades). The selectivity depends on factors such as temperature, presence of hydroxyl groups, and ammonia concentration. At lower temperatures and with hydroxyl groups present, a degradative pathway via acetone formation is favored. However, when ammonia blocks these sites, a more selective pathway becomes dominant.

The literature suggests that the non-stoichiometric properties of the vanadium antimonate catalyst influence the coordination and valence of surface vanadium ions, affecting their activity. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition and structure in determining process efficiency.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The presence of antimony in the catalyst helps to isolate vanadium sites, limiting undesired side reactions. This is evidenced by the dual role of vanadium ions: they not only catalyze the ODH of propane to propene but also facilitate the reoxidation of surface antimony sites, which are involved in the subsequent conversion of propene to acrylonitrile.

The reaction mechanisms proposed include C-H bond activation, likely involving Lewis acid sites associated with coordinatively unsaturated vanadium ions. While not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, the literature alludes to multiple mechanisms of alkane activation, which could include the formation of M-alkyl intermediates and 2H-abstraction processes.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the various reaction pathways available. Optimizing these factors, particularly through careful catalyst design and control of reaction conditions, is key to improving selectivity and conversion in the ODH of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。

根据文献，钒-锑氧化物催化剂在丙烷到丙烯的ODH中起关键作用，这是丙烯腈生产的重要一步。钒离子作为这种氧化脱氢反应的活性位点。然而，该过程在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临挑战。

存在多种反应途径，包括所需的ODH路径和不需要的导致碳氧化物或丙酮（进一步降解）的路径。选择性取决于温度、羟基的存在和氨浓度等因素。在较低的温度和存在羟基的情况下，通过丙酮形成的降解途径更有利。然而，当氨阻断这些位点时，一个更具选择性的途径就变得占主导地位。

文献表明，钒锑酸盐催化剂的非化学计量性质影响表面钒离子的配位和价态，从而影响其活性。这突出了催化剂组成和结构在决定过程效率中的重要性。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。催化剂中锑的存在有助于隔离钒位点，限制不需要的副反应。这从钒离子的双重作用得到证实：它们不仅催化丙烷到丙烯的ODH，还促进表面锑位点的再氧化，这些位点参与随后的丙烯到丙烯腈的转化。

提出的反应机理包括C-H键活化，可能涉及与配位不饱和钒离子相关的路易斯酸位点。虽然在给出的引文中没有明确提到，但文献暗示了多种烷烃活化机制，可能包括M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提过程。

总之，ODH过程的效率受到催化剂组成、反应条件和各种可用反应途径之间相互作用的共同影响。优化这些因素，特别是通过仔细的催化剂设计和反应条件控制，是提高烷烃ODH选择性和转化率的关键。
