[1] "Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts. A peculiar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst."

[2] "Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties. At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide."

[3] "Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."

[4] "Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions. This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in this reaction.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is because the desired alkene products are often more reactive than the alkane reactants, leading to over-oxidation and reduced selectivity.

Catalyst structure and composition significantly impact ODH efficiency. As noted in the literature, oxidation reactions are structure-sensitive, depending on the local and surface structure of oxide catalysts. The size of active sites, described as "molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms", greatly influences catalytic properties.

The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation, potentially forming M-alkyl intermediates, followed by 2H-abstraction to form the alkene. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen, is often implicated in these oxidation reactions.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Smaller, isolated active sites (like low-size polymeric species) often exhibit better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions compared to larger or bulk-type oxides. This is because isolated sites can limit over-oxidation by preventing rapid re-adsorption and further reaction of the desired products.

The dynamic nature of oxidation catalysts under reaction conditions, including the mobility of the oxide lattice, further complicates the process but also offers opportunities for in-situ optimization of catalyst performance.

In summary, the interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions collectively determines the efficiency of the ODH process. Optimizing these factors, particularly through site isolation and control of active site size and distribution, is key to addressing the challenges of selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。大块金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统在这个反应中起着关键作用。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。这是因为所需的烯烃产物通常比烷烃反应物更具反应性，容易导致过度氧化和选择性降低。

催化剂结构和组成显著影响ODH效率。正如文献所述，氧化反应对结构敏感，取决于氧化物催化剂的局部和表面结构。被描述为"金属氧化物原子的分子'无机集合体'"的活性位点的大小极大地影响了催化性能。

反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化，可能形成M-烷基中间体，随后进行2H-抽取形成烯烃。Mars和van Krevelen机理，涉及晶格氧，经常被认为参与这些氧化反应。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着至关重要的作用。较小的、孤立的活性位点（如低聚合度的聚合物物种）通常比较大或体相氧化物表现出更好的部分氧化反应选择性。这是因为孤立的位点可以通过防止所需产物的快速再吸附和进一步反应来限制过度氧化。

氧化催化剂在反应条件下的动态性质，包括氧化物晶格的移动性，进一步使过程复杂化，但也为催化剂性能的原位优化提供了机会。

总之，催化剂组成、结构和反应条件之间的相互作用共同决定了ODH过程的效率。优化这些因素，特别是通过位点隔离和控制活性位点的大小和分布，是解决ODH反应中选择性和转化率挑战的关键。
