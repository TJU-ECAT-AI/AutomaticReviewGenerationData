[1] "Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts. A peculiar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst."

[2] "Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties. At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide."

[3] "In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations exchanged or impregnated on the surface of zirconium hydrogenophosphates and compared to vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phosphate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 500C were observed when the material present either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 6 octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 4 respectively or chains of limited size"

[4] "Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."

[5] "Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions. This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. The interplay between bulk metal oxides and supported systems is crucial in determining catalytic performance.

Bulk metal oxides and supported catalysts exhibit different properties. Bulk oxides often provide high activity but may suffer from selectivity issues. Supported systems, on the other hand, allow for better control of active site dispersion and can enhance selectivity.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH reactions. This is primarily due to the tendency of alkanes to undergo complete oxidation, forming CO2 and H2O, rather than stopping at the desired alkene product. The catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds selectively while preventing over-oxidation is key to addressing this challenge.

The proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH typically involve:
1. C-H bond activation: The initial step where the catalyst abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane.
2. M-alkyl intermediates: Formation of a metal-carbon bond after C-H activation.
3. 2H-abstraction: Removal of a second hydrogen to form the alkene product.

These mechanisms are influenced by the nature of the active sites on the catalyst surface. The size and composition of the "inorganic ensembles" of metallic oxide atoms play a crucial role in determining catalytic properties.

Site isolation is an important strategy for improving selectivity in ODH reactions. By isolating active sites, over-oxidation can be minimized as the intermediate products have less chance of re-adsorbing on adjacent active sites. This concept is particularly relevant for supported catalysts, where the support material can help in dispersing and isolating active sites.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors. The catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds selectively, the nature and distribution of active sites, and the prevention of over-oxidation all contribute to the overall efficiency. The dynamic nature of oxidation catalysts under reaction conditions, following the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, further complicates the process but also offers opportunities for in-situ optimization of catalyst performance.

In conclusion, the development of efficient catalysts for ODH of alkanes requires a careful balance of these factors. Understanding the relationship between catalyst structure, active site nature, and reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and conversion in this challenging reaction.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。体相金属氧化物和负载系统之间的相互作用对决定催化性能至关重要。

体相金属氧化物和负载催化剂表现出不同的性质。体相氧化物通常提供高活性，但可能存在选择性问题。另一方面，负载系统允许更好地控制活性位点的分散，并可以提高选择性。

在ODH反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战。这主要是由于烷烃倾向于完全氧化，形成CO2和H2O，而不是停留在所需的烯烃产物阶段。催化剂选择性活化C-H键同时防止过度氧化的能力是解决这一挑战的关键。

ODH的提议反应机理通常包括：
1. C-H键活化：催化剂从烷烃中提取氢原子的初始步骤。
2. M-烷基中间体：C-H活化后形成金属-碳键。
3. 2H-提取：移除第二个氢以形成烯烃产物。

这些机理受催化剂表面活性位点性质的影响。金属氧化物原子"无机集合体"的大小和组成在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。

位点隔离是提高ODH反应选择性的重要策略。通过隔离活性位点，可以最大限度地减少过度氧化，因为中间产物重新吸附在相邻活性位点的机会较小。这个概念对于负载催化剂特别相关，其中载体材料可以帮助分散和隔离活性位点。

ODH过程的效率受这些因素的共同影响。催化剂选择性活化C-H键的能力、活性位点的性质和分布，以及防止过度氧化都有助于整体效率。氧化催化剂在反应条件下的动态性质，遵循Mars和van Krevelen机理，进一步增加了过程的复杂性，但也为催化剂性能的原位优化提供了机会。

总之，开发烷烃ODH的高效催化剂需要仔细平衡这些因素。理解催化剂结构、活性位点性质和反应机理之间的关系对于设计能在这一具有挑战性的反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂至关重要。
