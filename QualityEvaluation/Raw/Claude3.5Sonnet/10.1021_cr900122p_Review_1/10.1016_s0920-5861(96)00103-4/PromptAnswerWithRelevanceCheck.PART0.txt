The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. Bulk metal oxides and supported systems play crucial roles in this reaction.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is because the desired alkene products are often more reactive than the alkane reactants, leading to over-oxidation and reduced selectivity.

Catalyst structure and composition significantly impact ODH efficiency. As noted in the literature, oxidation reactions are structure-sensitive, depending on the local and surface structure of oxide catalysts. The size of active sites, described as "molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms", greatly influences catalytic properties.

The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation, potentially forming M-alkyl intermediates, followed by 2H-abstraction to form the alkene. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen, is often implicated in these oxidation reactions.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Smaller, isolated active sites (like low-size polymeric species) often exhibit better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions compared to larger or bulk-type oxides. This is because isolated sites can limit over-oxidation by preventing rapid re-adsorption and further reaction of the desired products.

The dynamic nature of oxidation catalysts under reaction conditions, including the mobility of the oxide lattice, further complicates the process but also offers opportunities for in-situ optimization of catalyst performance.

In summary, the interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions collectively determines the efficiency of the ODH process. Optimizing these factors, particularly through site isolation and control of active site size and distribution, is key to addressing the challenges of selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。大块金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统在这个反应中起着关键作用。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。这是因为所需的烯烃产物通常比烷烃反应物更具反应性，容易导致过度氧化和选择性降低。

催化剂结构和组成显著影响ODH效率。正如文献所述，氧化反应对结构敏感，取决于氧化物催化剂的局部和表面结构。被描述为"金属氧化物原子的分子'无机集合体'"的活性位点的大小极大地影响了催化性能。

反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化，可能形成M-烷基中间体，随后进行2H-抽取形成烯烃。Mars和van Krevelen机理，涉及晶格氧，经常被认为参与这些氧化反应。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着至关重要的作用。较小的、孤立的活性位点（如低聚合度的聚合物物种）通常比较大或体相氧化物表现出更好的部分氧化反应选择性。这是因为孤立的位点可以通过防止所需产物的快速再吸附和进一步反应来限制过度氧化。

氧化催化剂在反应条件下的动态性质，包括氧化物晶格的移动性，进一步使过程复杂化，但也为催化剂性能的原位优化提供了机会。

总之，催化剂组成、结构和反应条件之间的相互作用共同决定了ODH过程的效率。优化这些因素，特别是通过位点隔离和控制活性位点的大小和分布，是解决ODH反应中选择性和转化率挑战的关键。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst design and reaction mechanisms. 

Bulk metal oxides and supported catalysts play crucial roles in ODH reactions. The efficiency of these catalysts depends on their composition, structure, and morphology. The design of active sites, referred to as "inorganic oxide molecular clusters", significantly impacts catalytic performance. These ensembles are influenced by the nature of the material, its morphology, and structure.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH reactions stem from the interplay between the catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms. The metal-oxygen bond polarization in the catalyst affects whether the oxygen exhibits electrophilic or nucleophilic properties, which in turn influences the reaction pathway.

The proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH involve several steps:

1. C-H bond activation: This often occurs through nucleophilic attack by the catalyst's oxygen on the C-H bond adjacent to the double bond or aromatic ring.

2. M-alkyl intermediate formation: After C-H bond activation, a metal-alkyl intermediate may form.

3. 2H-abstraction: This step involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms from the alkane to form the alkene.

These mechanisms are not isolated events but occur as part of a concerted action involving homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bonds and electron transfer.

The concept of site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Single, isolated metallic ion sites are insufficient for the complex transformations required in ODH reactions. Instead, ensembles of atoms are necessary to facilitate the multiple steps involved, including oxygen vacancy replenishment, hydrogen atom extraction, and electron transfer.

The process efficiency is collectively influenced by the interplay between catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. Optimizing these factors requires a delicate balance to achieve high selectivity and conversion while minimizing undesired side reactions. The dynamic nature of the catalyst under reaction conditions further complicates this optimization process, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst's behavior in situ.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受催化剂设计和反应机理等多种因素影响的复杂过程。

大体积金属氧化物和负载型催化剂在ODH反应中起着至关重要的作用。这些催化剂的效率取决于它们的成分、结构和形态。被称为"无机氧化物分子簇"的活性位点设计显著影响催化性能。这些集合体受材料性质、形态和结构的影响。

ODH反应中实现高选择性和转化率的挑战源于催化剂性质和反应机理之间的相互作用。催化剂中金属-氧键的极化影响氧是表现出亲电性还是亲核性，进而影响反应路径。

ODH的提议反应机理包括几个步骤：

1. C-H键活化：这通常通过催化剂氧对双键或芳香环相邻的C-H键的亲核攻击发生。

2. M-烷基中间体形成：C-H键活化后，可能形成金属-烷基中间体。

3. 2H-抽提：这一步涉及从烷烃中移除两个氢原子以形成烯烃。

这些机理不是孤立的事件，而是作为涉及金属-氧键均裂和电子转移的协同作用的一部分发生。

位点隔离的概念在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。单一、孤立的金属离子位点不足以进行ODH反应所需的复杂转化。相反，需要原子集合体来促进涉及的多个步骤，包括氧空位补充、氢原子提取和电子转移。

过程效率受催化剂设计、反应机理和位点隔离之间相互作用的集体影响。优化这些因素需要精细平衡，以实现高选择性和转化率，同时最小化不希望的副反应。催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性进一步复杂化了这个优化过程，需要全面理解催化剂的原位行为。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. The interplay between bulk metal oxides and supported systems is crucial in determining catalytic performance.

Bulk metal oxides and supported catalysts exhibit different properties. Bulk oxides often provide high activity but may suffer from selectivity issues. Supported systems, on the other hand, allow for better control of active site dispersion and can enhance selectivity.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH reactions. This is primarily due to the tendency of alkanes to undergo complete oxidation, forming CO2 and H2O, rather than stopping at the desired alkene product. The catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds selectively while preventing over-oxidation is key to addressing this challenge.

The proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH typically involve:
1. C-H bond activation: The initial step where the catalyst abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane.
2. M-alkyl intermediates: Formation of a metal-carbon bond after C-H activation.
3. 2H-abstraction: Removal of a second hydrogen to form the alkene product.

These mechanisms are influenced by the nature of the active sites on the catalyst surface. The size and composition of the "inorganic ensembles" of metallic oxide atoms play a crucial role in determining catalytic properties.

Site isolation is an important strategy for improving selectivity in ODH reactions. By isolating active sites, over-oxidation can be minimized as the intermediate products have less chance of re-adsorbing on adjacent active sites. This concept is particularly relevant for supported catalysts, where the support material can help in dispersing and isolating active sites.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors. The catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds selectively, the nature and distribution of active sites, and the prevention of over-oxidation all contribute to the overall efficiency. The dynamic nature of oxidation catalysts under reaction conditions, following the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, further complicates the process but also offers opportunities for in-situ optimization of catalyst performance.

In conclusion, the development of efficient catalysts for ODH of alkanes requires a careful balance of these factors. Understanding the relationship between catalyst structure, active site nature, and reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and conversion in this challenging reaction.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。体相金属氧化物和负载系统之间的相互作用对决定催化性能至关重要。

体相金属氧化物和负载催化剂表现出不同的性质。体相氧化物通常提供高活性，但可能存在选择性问题。另一方面，负载系统允许更好地控制活性位点的分散，并可以提高选择性。

在ODH反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战。这主要是由于烷烃倾向于完全氧化，形成CO2和H2O，而不是停留在所需的烯烃产物阶段。催化剂选择性活化C-H键同时防止过度氧化的能力是解决这一挑战的关键。

ODH的提议反应机理通常包括：
1. C-H键活化：催化剂从烷烃中提取氢原子的初始步骤。
2. M-烷基中间体：C-H活化后形成金属-碳键。
3. 2H-提取：移除第二个氢以形成烯烃产物。

这些机理受催化剂表面活性位点性质的影响。金属氧化物原子"无机集合体"的大小和组成在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。

位点隔离是提高ODH反应选择性的重要策略。通过隔离活性位点，可以最大限度地减少过度氧化，因为中间产物重新吸附在相邻活性位点的机会较小。这个概念对于负载催化剂特别相关，其中载体材料可以帮助分散和隔离活性位点。

ODH过程的效率受这些因素的共同影响。催化剂选择性活化C-H键的能力、活性位点的性质和分布，以及防止过度氧化都有助于整体效率。氧化催化剂在反应条件下的动态性质，遵循Mars和van Krevelen机理，进一步增加了过程的复杂性，但也为催化剂性能的原位优化提供了机会。

总之，开发烷烃ODH的高效催化剂需要仔细平衡这些因素。理解催化剂结构、活性位点性质和反应机理之间的关系对于设计能在这一具有挑战性的反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂至关重要。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important industrial process that faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The analysis of this process involves considering various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used for ODH reactions. Vanadium and molybdenum are key elements in many catalysts, along with other transition metals with variable oxidation states like Fe, Cr, Cu, and Sb. The choice of catalyst significantly influences the reaction efficiency.

Reaction Mechanism: The ODH process typically follows a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, where the substrate is oxidized by the solid catalyst rather than directly by gaseous oxygen. This involves several steps, including C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The catalyst's oxygen is then replenished by gaseous oxygen.

Challenges in Selectivity and Conversion: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH reactions. This is partly because the desired products (alkenes) are often more reactive than the starting alkanes, leading to over-oxidation.

Site Isolation: The concept of site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Active sites for oxidation reactions are not isolated metal ions but rather "inorganic ensembles" of metallic oxide atoms. The size and composition of these ensembles greatly influence catalytic properties.

Catalyst Design: The design of effective catalysts involves considering the nature, oxidation state, and coordination environment of the metal ions. These factors determine the metal-oxygen bond polarization, which in turn affects whether the oxygen exhibits electrophilic or nucleophilic properties.

Size Effects: The size of the catalytic species has a significant impact on selectivity. Monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- often lead to total oxidation, while smaller polymeric species tend to exhibit better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions compared to larger species or bulk oxides.

By carefully considering these factors, researchers can work towards developing more efficient ODH catalysts that balance high conversion with good selectivity. The key lies in optimizing the size and composition of the active "inorganic ensembles" to promote the desired reaction pathway while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is an important industrial process that faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The literature provides insights into various aspects of this process:

1. Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used for ODH reactions. Vanadium and molybdenum are key elements in many of these catalysts. The support can significantly modify the catalytic properties of the oxide species.

2. Reaction mechanism: The ODH reaction typically follows a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, involving a redox cycle between the reactant molecules and surface active sites. The process begins with the homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond, facilitated by the transfer of hydrogen to an oxygen ion on the catalyst surface.

3. Challenges in selectivity and conversion: Achieving high selectivity while maintaining good conversion is a major challenge in ODH reactions. This is partly due to the tendency of monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- to exhibit acidic features, leading to total oxidation rather than selective dehydrogenation.

4. Site isolation: The concept of site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Low-size polymeric species often exhibit better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions compared to large size species or bulk-type oxides. This suggests that controlling the size and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface is key to improving selectivity.

5. Structure sensitivity: ODH reactions are structure-sensitive, meaning the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts greatly influences their performance. The stereochemistry of both the solid surface and the reactant molecules needs to be considered for optimal catalyst design.

6. C-H bond activation: The nucleophilic character of certain catalyst sites is important for the activation of C-H bonds, particularly those adjacent to double bonds or aromatic rings.

To improve process efficiency, researchers focus on optimizing catalyst composition, structure, and support interactions. The goal is to create catalysts with well-defined, isolated active sites that can selectively activate C-H bonds while minimizing over-oxidation. This requires a delicate balance between the redox properties of the catalyst, its acid-base characteristics, and its structural features.

3. 选择性和转化率的挑战：在保持良好转化率的同时实现高选择性是ODH反应的一个主要挑战。这部分是由于MoO42-或VO43-等单体物种倾向于表现出酸性特征，导致完全氧化而非选择性脱氢。

4. 位点隔离：位点隔离的概念在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。与大尺寸物种或体相氧化物相比，小尺寸的聚合物种通常对部分氧化反应表现出更好的选择性。这表明控制催化剂表面活性位的大小和分布是提高选择性的关键。

5. 结构敏感性：ODH反应对结构敏感，这意味着氧化物催化剂的局部和表面结构极大地影响其性能。为了优化催化剂设计，需要考虑固体表面和反应分子的立体化学。

6. C-H键活化：某些催化剂位点的亲核性对于C-H键的活化很重要，特别是那些邻近双键或芳香环的C-H键。

为了提高过程效率，研究人员专注于优化催化剂成分、结构和载体相互作用。目标是创造具有明确定义的、孤立的活性位点的催化剂，这些活性位点可以选择性地活化C-H键，同时最小化过度氧化。这需要在催化剂的氧化还原性能、酸碱特性和结构特征之间取得微妙的平衡。
