[1] "Oxidation catalytic reactions are of prime importance at an industrial level and correspond to a huge market."

[2] "Majority of the catalysts correspond to metallic oxides with V or Mo as one of the key elements but also cations of variable oxidation states as Fe3+/Fe2+; V5+/V3+, Mo6+/Mo5+, Cr6+/Cr3+, Cu2+/Cu+, Sb3+/Sb5+, etc."

[3] "According to this mechanism the substrate is oxidized by the solid and not directly by molecular oxygen of the gaseous phase. The rôle of dioxygen is to regenerate or maintain the oxidized state of the catalyst."

[4] "It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reaction since several steps as replenishing of oxygen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned."

[5] "Depending on the nature, oxidation state of the metal ion and its environment (coordination structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic properties."

[6] "Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."

[7] "Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties. At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important industrial process that faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The analysis of this process involves considering various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used for ODH reactions. Vanadium and molybdenum are key elements in many catalysts, along with other transition metals with variable oxidation states like Fe, Cr, Cu, and Sb. The choice of catalyst significantly influences the reaction efficiency.

Reaction Mechanism: The ODH process typically follows a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, where the substrate is oxidized by the solid catalyst rather than directly by gaseous oxygen. This involves several steps, including C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The catalyst's oxygen is then replenished by gaseous oxygen.

Challenges in Selectivity and Conversion: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH reactions. This is partly because the desired products (alkenes) are often more reactive than the starting alkanes, leading to over-oxidation.

Site Isolation: The concept of site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Active sites for oxidation reactions are not isolated metal ions but rather "inorganic ensembles" of metallic oxide atoms. The size and composition of these ensembles greatly influence catalytic properties.

Catalyst Design: The design of effective catalysts involves considering the nature, oxidation state, and coordination environment of the metal ions. These factors determine the metal-oxygen bond polarization, which in turn affects whether the oxygen exhibits electrophilic or nucleophilic properties.

Size Effects: The size of the catalytic species has a significant impact on selectivity. Monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- often lead to total oxidation, while smaller polymeric species tend to exhibit better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions compared to larger species or bulk oxides.

By carefully considering these factors, researchers can work towards developing more efficient ODH catalysts that balance high conversion with good selectivity. The key lies in optimizing the size and composition of the active "inorganic ensembles" to promote the desired reaction pathway while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个重要的工业过程，在实现高选择性和转化率方面面临着几个挑战。对这一过程的分析涉及考虑多个因素：

催化剂：ODH反应中使用了体相金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统。钒和钼是许多催化剂中的关键元素，还有其他具有可变氧化态的过渡金属，如Fe、Cr、Cu和Sb。催化剂的选择显著影响反应效率。

反应机理：ODH过程通常遵循Mars和van Krevelen机理，其中底物是被固体催化剂氧化，而不是直接被气相氧氧化。这涉及几个步骤，包括C-H键活化、形成M-烷基中间体和2H-抽提。催化剂的氧随后由气相氧补充。

选择性和转化率的挑战：在ODH反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战。这部分是因为所需产物（烯烃）通常比起始烷烃更具反应性，导致过度氧化。

位点隔离：位点隔离的概念在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。氧化反应的活性位点不是孤立的金属离子，而是金属氧化物原子的"无机集合体"。这些集合体的大小和组成极大地影响催化性能。

催化剂设计：设计有效的催化剂涉及考虑金属离子的性质、氧化态和配位环境。这些因素决定了金属-氧键的极化，进而影响氧是表现出亲电性还是亲核性。

尺寸效应：催化物种的尺寸对选择性有显著影响。像MoO42-或VO43-这样的单体物种通常导致完全氧化，而较小的聚合物种在部分氧化反应中表现出比大型物种或体相氧化物更好的选择性。

通过仔细考虑这些因素，研究人员可以致力于开发更高效的ODH催化剂，在高转化率和良好选择性之间取得平衡。关键在于优化活性"无机集合体"的大小和组成，以促进所需的反应路径，同时最小化不需要的副反应。
