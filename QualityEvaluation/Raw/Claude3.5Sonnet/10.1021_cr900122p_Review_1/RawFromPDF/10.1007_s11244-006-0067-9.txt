M2-type phases M3TeO10 (M = Mo and V), belonging to the Mo–V–Nb–Te-oxide system, were prepared by substituting to
various degrees the M-metal with W, Ti, Nb or Fe, and Te with Ce. The compositions were characterized by BET, XRD and XPS
and were studied for propene ammoxidation. The variations of the unit cell parameters with substitution reveal that the
orthorhombic, pseudo-hexagonal M2 structure is preserved to diﬀerent degrees depending on the substituent and its amount. It is
noted that partial substitution with W, Ti, Ce and Fe all increase the activity of the base composition and that Ce, and especially W,
improve the selectivity to acrylonitrile at the expense of acrolein. The results of the activity measurements and the XPS
investigation indicate that the site, activating propene and ammonia on the unsubstituted M2 phase is a surface ensemble of Mo
and Te. W and Ce were found to be able to mimic the role of Mo and Te, respectively; W mainly via site isolation and electronic
eﬀects, Ce via redox eﬀects. V- and Ti-sites are shown to be inactive, having merely the role of structure adjusting elements, and
serving as templates to complex the excess Te on the surface.

1. Introduction
The Mo–V–Nb–Te-oxide system is a highly promis-
ing catalyst system for propane oxidation and ammox-
idation to acrylic acid and acrylonitrile, respectively
[1–3]. Presently, it is well established that this catalyst
system consists of two orthorhombic phases, which are
termed M1 and M2 (pseudo-hexagonal) [4–8]. In our
previous work on the Mo–V–Nb–Te-oxide system for
propane ammoxidation [9], we have shown that acry-
lonitrile is formed from propane via intermediate pro-
pene. Of the two phases, the M1 phase is able not only
to activate and convert propane into propene, but can
also convert the propene formed into acrylonitrile
[10, 11]. In diﬀerence to M1, M2 does not have the
functionalities for activating propane but is able to
convert propene into acrylonitrile [9, 10]. Moreover, the
M2 phase is more selective than M1 for acrylonitrile
formation from propene. Selectivities for propene am-
moxidation up to 60% and 80%, respectively, have been
reported for the pure M1 and M2 phases [10]. With an
optimal relationship between M1 and M2 in the cata-
lyst, yields of acrylonitrile from propane up to 62% have
been reported [1, 2, 7]. In agreement with these ﬁndings,
we observed, compared with compacted lm-sized par-
ticles of the pure M1 phase, a signiﬁcant increase in the
yield and the selectivity to acrylonitrile when using a
compacted mixture of lm-sized particles of M1 and M2
(symbiosis) [10]. The eﬀect of M2 on the selectivity
became more pronounced as the conversion of propane
was increased, showing that the propene formed on M1
readsorbs on M2, where it reacts to give acrylonitrile.
The M1 phase has been reported to have the com-
position Mo7.8V1.2NbTe0.937O28.9 (Pba2; a = 21.134 A
˚ ;
b = 26.658 A
˚ ; c = 4.0146 A
˚ ; Z = 4) [12]. The M2
phase was likewise shown to have the composition
Mo4.31V1.36Nb0.33Te1.81O19.81 (Pmm2; a = 12.6294 A
˚ ;
b = 7.29156 A
˚ ; c = 4.02010 A
˚ ; Z = 4) [12], with a
structure similar to that of KW3O9 [13], and with Te
placed in the hexagonal channels. Besides the structural
diﬀerences between M1 and M2, the latter phase has
been reported to have no propane activating V5
+ sites in
the structure, but only V4
+ sites [11].
However, the performance of the Mo–V–Nb–Te-oxide
catalyst system still has to be improved before it can be
used on commercial scale. Improvement can be made by
optimizing the crystallite sizes and habits of the constit-
uent M1 and M2 phases and their mixing ratio. Another
option is to make substitutions in either or both phases.
The aim of this publication is to study the catalytic and
structural eﬀects of substitutions in the M2 phase for its
performance in converting propene to acrylonitrile.
Tuning of the composition of the M2 phase is of interest
not only as M2 together with M1 being components in
propane (amm)oxidation catalysts, but also because
M2 on its own right being a candidate catalyst for propene
ammoxidation.

replacement metals were selected considering their
valence, coordination and size, which should match those
of the replaced metals. Catalysts were prepared starting
from
the
basic
M2
composition
TeOM3O9
with
M = (Mo, V), having a KW3O9-type of structure [13],
and substituting to diﬀerent levels W, Ti, Fe, Nb and Te
for Mo and V, and Ce for Te. The catalysts have been
examined with BET, XRD, XPS and activity measure-
ments in order to determine the success of the substitu-
tion.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared using the precursor method
[1,2]. The precursors to the orthorhombic (pseudo-hex-
agonal)
phase
were
prepared
from
(NH4)6Mo7O24Æ4H2O, NH4VO3, H6TeO6, Nb2O5Æ6H2O,
(NH4)6W12(OH)2O38,
TiO2,
Fe(NO3)3Æ9H2O
and
Ce(NO3)3Æ6H2O in desired amounts, which were dis-
solved in water at 60 C. Each batch consisted of metal
salts corresponding to 5 g of metals in 20 mL of water.
The water of the prepared solutions was then allowed to
evaporate in an oven equipped with forced air circula-
tion, where the samples were kept for 4 h at an ambient
temperature of 150 C. The obtained precursors were
then calcined in two steps in order to give the correct
phase. In the ﬁrst step, the precursors were calcined in
air at 275 C for 2 h and then in the subsequent step, for
another 2 h under a ﬂow of argon in a quartz reactor at
550 C.
Pure unsubstituted M2 was prepared according to the
formula
Mo49V26Te25O250
(denoted
M2-b),
corre-
sponding
to
25
TeOM3O9
formula
units
with
M = (Mo, V) in octahedral positions and with Te ﬁlling
up the hexagonal channels. A catalyst termed M2-a was
prepared having the composition Mo47V25Te28O250, or
Mo47Te3V25Te25O250, with some of the M-metal posi-
tions probably being occupied by Te. This sample has
been used as a reference sample, in which further sub-
stitution was made.
Starting from the composition Mo47V25Te28O250
several series were prepared with nominal substitution
of W for Mo, Ti and Fe for V, Ce for Te and Nb for
Mo, V or both. Substitutions with W were prepared
corresponding to 30%, 50%, 70% and 100% replace-
ment of Mo by W. The samples in this series are denoted
MW-yy where yy is the percentage of replacement.
Similar series of samples were prepared with replace-
ment of V by Ti and Te by Ce, which are denoted VT-yy
and TC-yy, respectively. One catalyst with 20% of the V
being replaced by Fe was prepared (VF-20). Four
samples with substitution of Nb for Mo and V were
prepared, which are denoted MN-30, VN-30, MVN-8-
15 and MVN-14-25. In the ﬁrst two samples Nb,
respectively, has replaced 30% of Mo and 30% of V. In
the MVN-uu-zz samples, Nb has been substituted for
uu% and zz% of the Mo and the V, respectively. The
notations used for the prepared samples are given in
table 1 together with the metal composition in at. %. In
the table is also indicated the phase purity of the prep-
arations as determined by XRD. Only the preparations
that are single phase or almost single phase were used in
the activity measurements after being sieved to give a
250- to 425-lm fraction of particles.
2.2. Activity measurements
The prepared catalysts were tested for ammoxidation
of propene. The experiments were performed at atmo-
spheric pressure and isothermal conditions using a plug-
ﬂow micro-reactor made of stainless steel. The catalyst
load was 0.50–2.50 g. The reactant ﬂow of oxygen,
ammonia, propene and argon was varied between 10.2
and 23.1 N cm3/min, and the reaction temperature was
set to 400 C. To improve the temperature control of the
reactor, it was embedded in an aluminum block and
placed in a tube furnace. Propene, acrylonitrile, aceto-
nitrile, acrolein and CO2 were analyzed online using a
gas chromatograph, which was equipped with an FID
detector, a TCD detector and a Haysep Q column. CO
was analyzed online with an IR instrument (Rosemount
Binos 100). The exit line from the reactor to the gas
chromatograph was kept at 200C.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
All fresh catalysts were examined by X-ray powder
diﬀraction (XRD) on a Seifert XRD 3000 TT diﬀrac-
tometer using Ni-ﬁltered Cu Ka radiation. The instru-
ment was calibrated using a silicon standard. The unit

cell parameters of M2 were determined using the free-
ware PowderCell 2.4 written by W. Kraus and G. Nolze,
Berlin. Crystal structure data was taken from Ref. [12]
and the following parameters were varied in the Rietveld
reﬁnements: scale, specimen displacement and overall
temperature factors, as well as: lattice, background,
peak width and zero-point parameters, while the atomic
positions were kept ﬁxed.
The speciﬁc surface areas of the catalysts were mea-
sured with a Micromeritics Flowsorb 2300 instrument.
The single point BET method was used with adsorption
of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen temperature and sub-
sequent desorption at room temperature. All samples
were degassed at 200 C for 24 h.
XPS analyses were performed on a Kratos AXIS 165
instrument using monochromatic Al Ka X-ray radiation
(1486.58 eV). The C 1s signal was used as a reference
peak and was set to a binding energy of 284.8 eV. The
experimental data were analyzed using the CasaXPS
software and the quantiﬁcations were made using a
linear background. All measurements were made on
pellets.
3. Results
3.1. Speciﬁc surface area
The speciﬁc surface areas of the prepared samples
vary between 0.5 and 3.0 m2/g as shown in table 1. The
M2-b catalyst has a BET-area of 2.5 m2/g, while the
speciﬁc surface area of the reference sample M2-a is
1.3 m2/g. The catalyst with all Mo replaced by W shows
a similar surface area, while the samples containing both
Mo and W display a larger surface area; about 2 m2/g.
The substitution of Ti for V has a negative impact on the
speciﬁc surface area, which decreases with the degree of
Ti substitution. Replacing either V or Mo by Nb seems
to give an increase in speciﬁc surface area, with the
greatest increase when both V and Mo are replaced by
Nb. Replacing Te by Ce as well as replacing V by Fe
give a decrease in surface area.
3.2. X-ray diﬀraction
All fresh catalysts were examined by XRD. The dif-
fraction patterns of some representative catalysts are
shown in ﬁgure 1. The diﬀractograms display the typical
reﬂections from an orthorhombic (pseudo-hexagonal)
type of M2 phase [6,8,10–12]. As indicated in table 1,
according to XRD most of the prepared samples are
single phase and show only reﬂections from an M2-type
of structure. A few very weak additional lines not
belonging to M2 were observed in the diﬀractogram of
VT-50. Two preparations, VT-70 and TC-50, displayed
a few somewhat stronger reﬂections not belonging to
M2, indicating that in M2 it is not possible to replace all
V and Te by Ti and Ce, respectively. The data indicates
that Ti and Ce can replace up to about 50% of the V
and 30% of the Te, respectively. Substitution of W for
Mo, on the other hand, was successful up to the com-
plete replacement of the Mo. Concerning substitution
with Fe and Nb, the XRD data collected showed that
20% of the V can be replaced by Fe and Nb can sub-
stitute for 30% of the Mo and 30% of the V. No attempt
was made to substitute for higher levels of Fe and Nb.
Figure 1 shows that the replacement of Mo, V and Te
by the other elements results in a shift of the peak
positions due to the unit cell changes. The lattice con-
stants were reﬁned and the data obtained are given in
table 2 and the trends for W, Ti and Ce substitution are
plotted in ﬁgure 2. As can be seen in ﬁgure 2, the lattice
parameters of M2 varies linearly with the degree of
substitution, i.e. Vegard’s law is obeyed, up to the point
where a second crystalline phase is observed. The lack of
any sign of the lattice parameters becoming constant or
growing diﬀuse features in the background of the XRD
patterns, with increasing substitution, indicates that the
formation of an XRD-amorphous bulk phase can be
ruled out. The lattice parameters for the M2-a reference
sample and the M2-b sample are almost the same
(Table 2). The data in Table 2 and ﬁgure 2 shows that
the a- and b-axes increase with the degree of W and Ti
substitution for Mo and V, respectively, and decrease

with the level of Ce substitution for Te. The c-axis for
the MW and TC samples, compared with the corre-
sponding a- and b-axes, shows a reverse variation.
Concerning the volume of the unit cell, replacement of V
by Ti gives an enlargement, while a decrease is obtained
replacing Mo and Te with W and Ce, respectively.
Moreover, the data in table 2 shows that replacement of
Mo and V by Nb leads to enlargement of the a- and
b-axes, contraction of the c-axis, and increase of the cell
volume. Substitution of Fe for V mainly aﬀects the
a-axis, which is increased.
A selection of samples was tested after being used in
propene ammoxidation. No signiﬁcant changes of the
diﬀraction patterns were observed compared to before
use. As an example the diﬀractogram of the used VT-30
has been included in ﬁgure 1.
3.3. Propene ammoxidation
All samples in table 1 displaying a pure or almost
pure (VT-50) M2-structure were tested in propene
ammoxidation. The initial reaction rate and the selec-
tivities to the C3-products acrylonitrile and acrolein are
presented in ﬁgures 3–7. Other products observed were
mainly acetonitrile, CO and CO2.
Figure 3 presents a comparison at 30% propene
conversion of M2-a (reference sample) and M2-b, where
M2-b is the sample with Te nominally in the hexagonal
channels only. It can be seen that the M2-b is slightly
less active than M2-a. The selectivity to acrylonitrile is
almost the same on both catalysts. However, the selec-
tivity to acrolein and the sum of the selectivities to
C3-products are higher on the M2-a catalyst.
Also in ﬁgure 3 are data for the samples having Mo
and/or V replaced by Nb. Compared with M2-a,
replacement of Mo with Nb (MN-30) gives a minor
decrease in activity from 5.1 to 4.7 lmol/m2/min. The
selectivity to acrylonitrile displays a small increase from
52% to 55%, while the selectivity to acrolein decreases
from 27% to 13% resulting in a total decrease of the
selectivity to C3-products. Replacement of V by Nb
(VN-30) gives an increase in activity (6.3 compared to
5.1 lmol/m2/min), however, the selectivities to acrolein
and acrylonitrile are largely unaﬀected. The catalytic
data for MVN-8-15 and MVN-14-25, in which both Mo
and V have been replaced by some Nb, show no other
eﬀect than those introduced by each single substitution.
A comparison of the data for the reference sample
and the corresponding data for its analogues with W
replacing Mo are shown in ﬁgure 4. The ﬁgure shows
that the activity passes through a maximum with an
increase in W-content, peaking at MW-70 with an
activity of 6.2 lmol/m2/min. The MW-100 sample,
however, is considerably less active than the reference
sample. It is further noticed that the selectivity towards
acrolein is substantially decreased when the W-content
is increased. The selectivity to acrolein is 27% for the
reference sample and 0% for the MW-100 sample. It is
worth noting that the decrease in selectivity to acrolein
is accompanied by a slightly larger increase of the
selectivity to acrylonitrile. The highest selectivity of
about 83% to C3-products is obtained on MW-70.
MW-100 without Mo in the structure is more selective
than the reference sample towards acrylonitrile forma-
tion. However, its selectivity towards the sum of acrolein
and acrylonitrile is considerably lower. Consequently,
the selectivity to C3-products and the activity are both
improved by mixing Mo and W in the structure.
Figure 5 shows that the catalysts with Ti substituted
for V in the M2 structure are considerably more active
than the reference sample. There is a trend that the
activity of the catalyst increases with the Ti-content. The
VT-50 catalyst has an activity of 8.3 lmol/m2/min
compared to 5.1 lmol/m2/min for the reference sample.
Moreover, according to the results, there is no sub-
stantial diﬀerence between the samples for the selectiv-
ities to acrolein and acrylonitrile.
Figure 6 presents a comparison between the reference
sample and the TC-30 sample with Ce substituted for
some of the Te in the hexagonal channels. The selectiv-
ities here are compared at 15% propene conversion due
to the fact that the low surface area of TC-30 gave low
activity per gram of sample. The results show that TC-30
is somewhat more active than the reference sample. No
acrolein is formed on TC-30 while M2-a displays a
selectivity of 10% to acrolein. The lower selectivity to
acrolein for TC-30 is associated with a corresponding
increase in selectivity to acrylonitrile, thus preserving the
sum of the selectivities to C3-products.
A comparison of catalytic data for VF-20, with Fe
being substituted for 20% of the V, and the reference
M2-a are presented in ﬁgure 7. The comparison of the
selectivities is made at 15% propene conversion due to
the surface area and, consequently, the activity per gram
of sample being low for VF-20. Figure 7 shows that

Fe-substitution gives a more active catalyst not forming
acrolein. However, in contrast to the data for TC-30 in
ﬁgure 6, the absence of acrolein is not associated with
any increase of the selectivity to acrylonitrile, which is
almost the same as that for M2-a.
3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
The binding energies and the surface concentrations
of the metals in the catalysts were determined by XPS.
Measurements were made on all the freshly prepared
samples being selected for activity measurements, and a
selection of these was also investigated after use in
propene ammoxidation.
For the series with W substituted for Mo, the surface
concentrations of the metals are plotted in ﬁgure 8
against the W-content of the bulk as it is given in
table 1. It is seen that the Te-content on the surface is
considerably higher than the corresponding content of
the bulk and passes through a minimum when the
W-content of the material is increased. The concentra-
tions of V and W at the surface are lower than in the
bulk. For Mo, on the other hand, there is an almost
perfect correspondence between the bulk and surface
concentrations. Moreover, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence in the metal composition of the surfaces before and
after use in propene ammoxidation.

The surface concentrations of the metals for the
samples with Ti are displayed in ﬁgure 9. Here it is seen
that the surfaces, compared with the bulk, are rich in Te
and poor in V and Ti. The Mo-content at the surface is
just slightly below the bulk value, which is the same for
all samples. No changes in the metal composition of the
surfaces are noticeable after the samples have been used
in ammoxidation.
Data on the bulk and surface compositions are pre-
sented in table 3 for those samples that are not included
in ﬁgures 8 and 9. A comparison of the data for the
reference sample M2-a with those for M2-b, which
contains less Te, show for both samples a strong
enrichment of Te at the surface. Both the V- and the
Mo-content at the surface are lower than in the
bulk, however, both absolutely and relatively it is

the V-content that is aﬀected the most. Similar to the
M2 samples, TC-30, VF-20 and the Nb-substituted
samples show enrichment of Te at the surface along with
depletion of especially V. Moreover, the surface of TC-
30 is enriched with Ce, while there is almost no enrich-
ment of Fe at the surface of VF-20. The Nb-substituted
samples have similar Nb-content at the surface as in the
bulk. The data in table 3 for fresh samples are almost
the same as those for the corresponding samples after
being submitted to propene ammoxidation.
For consideration of the valence states of the metals
at the surfaces, the features of the core line regions were
analyzed. The values obtained for the binding energies
of freshly prepared catalysts have been summarized in
table 4. It was observed that most samples, except VT-
50, display only one Mo 3d5/2 peak, which is at 232.8–
233.0 eV and can be assigned to Mo6
+ [14–16]. VT-50
displayed a Mo 3d5/2 peak, which after deconvolution
showed a major peak at 232.8 eV and a minor one at
231.5 eV, where the latter peak is from Mo5
+ [15,16].
All samples showed a single featured V 2p3/2 signal at
516.7–517.1 eV, indicating essentially the V5
+ surface
state [17, 18]. Most samples displayed only one Te 3d5/2
signal at around 576.3–576.8 eV, which possibly is from
Te6
+ surface states in agreement with the Te 3d5/2

binding energy for TeO3 and Te(OH)6 is 576.6 and
577.1 eV, respectively [6]. In addition to the signal from
Te6
+, MW-70 and VF-20 showed an additional small
peak at 574.9 and 574.4 eV, respectively, which possibly
is from Te4
+. The sample with Ce (TC-30) contains both
Ce4
+ and Ce3
+ as was evidenced by the appearance of
Ce 3d5/2 peaks at 881.8 and 885.7 eV. The former peak
has been assigned to a mixing of 3d94f2(O 2p4) and
3d94f1(O 2p5) Ce4
+ ﬁnal states, and the latter peak to the
3d94f1(O 2p6) Ce3
+ ﬁnal state [19,20]. The core line
spectra of the other substituents showed the presence of
a single oxidation state. Considering the binding ener-
gies measured for these elements (see table 4) it can be
concluded that they are all in the highest oxidation state,
i.e. 248 eV for W6
+ [17], 459 eV for Ti4
+ [20],
207 eV for Nb5
+ [14–16], and 712 eV for Fe3
+ [21].
Several of the catalysts that were analyzed after use in
propene ammoxidation showed reduction of Mo and
Te, while reduction of neither V nor any substituent was
observed. The Mo 3d5/2 (3d3/2 for TC-30) and Te 3d5/2
peak positions are listed in table 5. In addition to the
Mo6
+ and Te6
+ states, the reduced samples show the
presence of Mo5
+ with a binding energy of about
231.5 eV [15, 16] and either one or two reduced Te
states. The Te 3d5/2 binding energies of the reduced Te
species are at about 574.9 and 573.5 eV, which possibly
are from Te4
+ and Te2
+, respectively. Some typical
spectra of the Mo 3d5/2 and Te 3d5/2 regions for reduced
samples are shown in ﬁgure 10.
4. Discussion
4.1. Substitutions in the M2 phase
The orthorhombic, pseudo-hexagonal M2 structure is
related to that of the tungsten bronzes (K, Rb,
Cs)xW3O9 where x is variable and has an upper limit of
one [13]. This structure is built up of layers with WO6
octahedra
connected
by
corners
forming
3-
and
6-membered rings. The layers are connected by the WO6
octahedra sharing corners, creating hexagonal channels
along the c-axis. In the bronzes the alkali metal is situ-
ated in the channels. Completely occupied channels
correspond to the formula (K, Rb, Cs)1W3O9. In the M2
Mo–V–(Nb)–Te-oxide structure, the channels are occu-
pied by interconnected Te–O units forming inﬁnite
chains along the c-axis [6,8,11,12]. When the hexagonal
channels are completely ﬁlled with Te–O units, the for-
mula becomes (TeO)(Mo,V)3O9. The structure of the
M2 phase is depicted in ﬁgure 11.
Reﬁnement of the M2 structure together with bond-
valence sum calculations have shown that in bulk M2
the valences of the cations are predominantly Mo6
+,
V4
+, and Te4
+ [11,12]. Thus, with these valences the
composition of Nb-free M2 with ﬁlled channels corre-
sponds to (TeO)Mo2V1O9 or Mo2V1Te1O10. The XRD
patterns of a preparation with this stoichiometry (M2-b)
showed only the reﬂections from the basic M2 structure
(see tables 1 and 2). It was also observed that the sample
M2-a, with 6% of the Mo being replaced by Te, was

single-phase and has a unit cell deviating very little from
that of M2-b (table 2), indicating that some of the
octahedral Mo6
+ can be replaced by Te6
+. This
assumption agrees with the fact that 6-coordinated Te6
+
and Mo6
+ have similar ionic radii 0.70 and 0.73 A
˚ ,
respectively [22].
Concerning substitution of W for Mo and Ti for V,
these substitutions should be possible considering the
respective ionic radius and coordination. The ionic
radius for 6-coordinated Mo6
+ and W6
+ is 0.73 and
0.74 A
˚ , respectively, and the corresponding values are
0.72 and 0.745 A
˚ , respectively, for 6-coordinated V4
+
and Ti4
+ [22]. The fact that 6-coordinated Mo6
+ and
W6
+ are very close in size is in agreement with the
observation that all Mo can be replaced by W (table 1
and ﬁgure 2), which agrees also with the M2 and
KW3O9 structures being related. Our ﬁnding that no
more than half of the V4
+ can be replaced by Ti4
+
(table 1) agrees with these two cations showing a larger
diﬀerence in size.
Our XRD results in tables 1 and 2 suggest that Nb can
substitute for both Mo6
+ and V4
+ in the M2 structure,
although the substitution limits for Nb were not deter-
mined. Previous work has indicated that the Nb in M2 is
pentavalent [11,12]. This indication is not unreasonable as
the ionic radius for 6-coordinated Nb5
+ is 0.78 A
˚ to be
compared with 0.73 and 0.72 A
˚ for 6-coordinated Mo6
+
and V4
+, respectively [22]. Tetravalent Nb, having the
radius 0.82 A
˚ [22], possibly is too large for replacing V4
+.
Consequently, the most likely substitution mechanisms
for
Nb
are
Mo6
+ + V4
+ M Nb5
+ + V5
+,
Mo6
+ +
V4
+ M Mo5
+ + Nb5
+ and Mo6
+ + V4
+ M 2Nb5
+.

Substitution of Fe for some of the V was attempted in
order to create V5
+ sites in the M2 structure. This
attempt was made because it is known that the M1
phase with V5
+ sites is active for propane oxidation and
ammoxidation while the M2 having solely V4
+ sites in
the bulk structure is unable to activate propane [7,9–11,
23]. Our data (tables 1 and 2) show that Fe can replace
at least 20% of the V (VF-20), a ﬁgure that is not
unreasonable as the ionic radii for the 6-coordinated
Fe3
+ (0.69 A
˚ ) and V4
+ (0.72 A
˚ ) are close [22]. In this
case
the
substitution
mechanism
would
be
2V4
+ M Fe3
+ + V5
+. However, activity measurements
showed that the Fe-substituted sample was inactive for
propane ammoxidation, verifying that the ability of M1
to convert propane to useful products is due not only to
the presence of V5
+ sites but also because these are
properly localized in the structure and at the surface
forming a multicomponent and spatially restricted
ensemble [7,11,12].
In M2, the Te4
+ in the hexagonal channels is dis-
placed from the center and is coordinated to four
oxygen atoms, of which two are in the channel and two
are shared with 6-coordinated metals [6,12]. According
to the XRD data shown in tables 1 and 2, replacement
of at least 30% of Te by Ce seems possible. However,
Ce cations are about 10% smaller than Te cations with
the same valence and coordination [22] and, moreover,
Ce4
+ prefers either 6- or 8-coordination. Therefore, we
should expect the Ce4
+ ion to be positioned closer to
the center of the hexagonal channel where it will
become 8-coordinated. Eight-coordinated Ce4
+ has an
ionic radius of about 1.11 A
˚ [22]. Support for such an
arrangement is that the La3
+ in the related compound
LaxWO3
+y, with x  0.10 and y  0.15, is positioned
exactly in the center of the hexagonal channel [24]. The
ionic radius of 8-coordinated La3
+ is 1.30 A
˚
[22].
Considering that the XPS data in table 4 are in
agreement with the presence of both Ce3
+ and Ce4
+, it
cannot be excluded that some of the Ce in the channels
is present as Ce3
+ (1.28 A
˚ [22]).
The variations of the unit cell volumes, see table 2
and ﬁgure 2, are generally consistent with the variations
in ionic radii. Cerium substitution gives contraction in
a · b and expansion of the c-axis. However, as expected
the unit cell volume decreases. Substitution of Nb and
W, which are larger ions than Mo and V, leads to
expansion of the ab-plane and contraction of the c-axis.
Contrary to Nb-substitution, substitution of W for Mo
results in a decrease of the unit cell volume despite of the
W ion being somewhat larger than the Mo ion. This
observation is presently under investigation using elec-
tron microscopy and diﬀraction techniques. Here it can
also be pointed out that the hardness of the particles
increased with the degree of W-substitution. Improved
hardness gives better attrition resistance, and both are
important properties in commercial catalyst applica-
tions, e.g. ﬂuidized bed reactor.
4.2. Catalytic eﬀects of the substitutions
The catalytic eﬀects of the substitutions as they
appear in ﬁgures 3–7 can be divided broadly into four
groups, namely (i) substitutions increasing the activity
(Nb, Ti and Fe for V, W for Mo, and Ce for Te), (ii)
substitutions increasing the selectivity to acrylonitrile at
the expense of acrolein, maintaining the sum of the
selectivities to C3-products almost constant (W for Mo
except MW-100, and Ce for Te), (iii) substitutions
essentially not aﬀecting the selectivity (Ti for V, and Nb
for Mo and V), and (iv) substitution burning acrolein
(Fe for V). With regard to both selectivity and activity
the W-substituted MW-70 is the best catalyst, giving
both good activity and a selectivity to acrylonitrile of
about 80%. The second best is the Ce-substituted TC-30
giving 70% selectivity to acrylonitrile. Concerning the
activity per unit surface area of sample, the Ti-substi-
tuted VT-50 is the most active sample, however, it does
not improve selectivity when compared to the unsub-
stituted M2-a.
Substitution of Ti for V was performed to see if
V-centers are active for propene conversion. Quite
unexpectedly the activity was found to increase consid-
erably with the degree of Ti-substitution, while the
product distribution is virtually unaﬀected (ﬁgure 5).
This result conﬁrms that V-centers have no direct cata-
lytic function for the activation of either propene or
ammonia. If this were the case, the activity should not
increase because it is well established that titania has low
activity and, moreover, is unselective for partial oxida-
tion [25]. Thus, if V-sites were participating in the acti-
vation of ammonia, the product distribution should be
inﬂuenced. The activity increase should therefore not be
interpreted as though Ti-centers were active for propene
conversion. Rather, it is likely that the increase of the
activity is a secondary eﬀect, being caused by the
replacement of V by Ti, leading to some adjustment of
the bond lengths and the atom positions in the active
structure. Likewise, the increase of the activity being
caused by the replacement of V by Nb (ﬁgure 3) can also
be due to the same type of secondary eﬀect, considering
that Nb-centers usually are not directly involved in the
activation of either ammonia or propene. Reﬁnement of
the M2 structure has shown that the Te in the hexagonal
channels is displaced from the center of the channel
towards V-sites [12]. Thus, replacement of the smaller
V4
+ by the larger Ti4
+ or Nb5
+ should lead to a dis-
placement of the Te to a position that is apparently
more optimal for the activity. Such an explanation to
the eﬀects of Ti- and Nb-substitution agrees with pre-
vious studies suggesting that Te-sites are involved in the
abstraction of an a-hydrogen atom from propene; i.e., in
its activation process [7,11]. The increase of the activity
being associated with the intended incorporation of
Fe3
+ for V4
+, however, seems to be linked to the Fe-site
being active for burning acrolein (ﬁgure 7) without
J. Holmberg et al./Propene ammoxidation on substituted Mo–V–Nb–Te-oxide catalysts
26
aﬀecting the selectivity to acrylonitrile. This observation
agrees with acrylonitrile, opposed to acrolein, being a
relatively stable product [26].
The ﬁnding that both the activity and the selectivity to
acrylonitrile pass through maxima with the degree of
substitution of W for Mo is consistent with the Mo
species being involved in the activation of both propene
and ammonia [7,10,27]. The eﬀect of W substitution
leads to an increase in activity up to and including a 70%
level (MW-30 to MW-70), as illustrated in ﬁgure 4. As
expected, the fully W-substituted composition (MW-
100) is less active than the base composition (M2-a). In
fact it is remarkable, that the activity of the tungstate is a
respectable 3.7 lmol/m2/min, compared to a 5.1 lmol/
m2/min for the molybdate. A possible explanation for the
relatively high activity of the tungstate is, as discussed
below (Section 4.3), that in this composition the well-
accepted Te–O–Mo site mechanism changes to a V–O–
Te site mechanism. Of interest is the steady (from 0 to
50% W substitution) and then rather sharp increase in
activity when going from 50 to 70% W substitution. The
selectivity to acrylonitrile increases also similarly with W
substitution peaking at 70% W. Most of the gain in
acrylonitrile selectivity comes on account of a decrease in
the acrolein make. Therefore, it can be reasoned that
most of the W eﬀect is caused by structural means, rather
than electronic (i.e., a large amount of W substitution for
Mo is needed to realize the eﬀect). The Mo sites become
more diluted and separated from each other resulting in a
concomitant selectivity increase that can be ascribed to
the phenomenon of site isolation [28,29]. In this manner,
at the catalytic selectivity optimum there are 4 W and 2
Mo octahedra per unit cell (ﬁgure 11) rather than 6 Mo
as in the base catalyst. There is also very likely a positive
electronic eﬀect to be considered, induced through the
presence of W, akin to W substitution in complex
Bi-molybdates in the ammoxidation of propene to
acrylonitrile or with other complex catalysts for the
conversion of propene to acrolein and acrolein to acrylic
acid [30].
Another fact agreeing with Mo species being active is
that substitution of Nb for Mo causes lowering of the
activity and almost unchanged product selectivity to
acrylonitrile.
However,
for
MN-30
(ﬁgure 3),
the
decrease in activity is small compared to the degree of
substitution and, moreover, it seems that the sample
burns some acrolein. This result infers that the Nb
species has some activity for burning acrolein.
Substitution of Ce for Te (ﬁgure 6) has a similar
inﬂuence on the catalytic performance as substitution of
W for Mo (ﬁgure 4), i.e. both substitutions increase the
activity and the selectivity to acrylonitrile, maintaining
the sum of the selectivities to the C3-products almost
unchanged. This result gives support to the indications
discussed above, namely that Mo-sites together with
neighboring Te-sites form the ensemble at the surface
being active for the conversion of propene and ammonia
to acrylonitrile. Cerium sites, likewise Te-sites, may be
involved not only in the abstraction of the a-hydrogen
atom from propene but also in the abstraction of
hydrogen
from
ammonia.
Considering
that
the
replacement of Te by Ce gives more acrylonitrile and
less acrolein (ﬁgure 6), it seems that Ce-sites are more
eﬃcient than Te-sites for the selective activation of
ammonia. The eﬀect of Ce, leading to an improvement
in activity of the base catalyst (ﬁgure 6, TC-30 vs. M2-a)
is likely caused by the classic redox eﬀect. Such an eﬀect
is seen already in the once pilot planted Montedison
catalyst for the conversion of propene to acrylonitrile
and comprised of TeCeMoO [31], being superior to its
predecessor comprised of TeMoO only. Other literature
[32] pertaining to BiCeMoO catalysts also reveals that
Ce increases selectivity and particularly activity over the
base having no Ce, or over isostructural compositions
containing the redox-inert La instead of Ce in the
structure.
In
the
MoV(Te,Ce)O
compositions
the
eﬀect
is
very
similar,
namely
the
shuttle
Ce4þ þ Mo5þ ! Ce3þ þ Mo6þ keeps the time averaged
catalytically active sites in the fully oxidized and cata-
lytically active form.
4.3. Importance of the surface composition
Additional support for the idea that Mo and Te, as
well as, their substituents W and Ce, respectively, are
involved in the activation of propene and ammonia, are
obtained from the XPS analyses. The measurements
show that (i) besides oxygen, Mo (W) and Te (Ce) are
the dominant surface species, (ii) both Mo and Te are
reduced upon use in ammoxidation, and (iii) W- and
Ce-sites are more eﬃciently reoxidized than Mo- and
Te-sites.
The XPS data in ﬁgures 8, 9 and table 3 show that the
surfaces of the catalyst are strongly enriched with Te, and
with Ce, when present. The enrichment has only a minor
inﬂuence on the surface concentration of Mo as well of Nb
and Fe, while the surface concentrations of the other
elements are more severely aﬀected. Whether the enrich-
ment leads to the formation of supra-surface Te-sites atop

of V, W and Ti surface sites or the surplus Te goes into the
positions of the latter elements is presently unclear. In
light of the notable diﬀerence between the bulk and the
surface composition of the catalysts, it is possible that the
M2 bulk structure is terminated by a structurally diﬀerent
and ill-deﬁned surface region in agreement with other
recent studies [33]. As use in propene ammoxidation does
not lead to any change of the metal composition of the
catalyst surfaces, it appears that the surfaces are stable.
The relatively high surface content of Te and the indica-
tion that the surface has V5
+ and Te6
+ species, although
both metals are tetravalent in the bulk of the material can
be explained by some of the Te4
+ species migrating out
from the mouth of the hexagonal channel forming Te6
+
and an associated V5
+ surface species. The appearance of
an associated V5
+ species can be understood considering
that the composition of a M2 with ﬁlled channels can be
formulated as Mo2
6
+V1
4
+Te1
4
+O10 while the composi-
tion of a hypothetical M2 with half-ﬁlled channels cor-
responds to Mo2
6
+V1
5
+Te0.5
4
+O9.5. Thus, each TeO2
+
deﬁciency in the hexagonal channel leads to two V atoms
being oxidized from V4
+ to V5
+. In fact it has been
reported that the hexagonal channels in M2 do not have
to be completely ﬁlled with TeO units but can be partly
ﬁlled [12], which is in agreement with the x-value of
KxW3O9 being variable [13]. For instance, the previously
reported
M2
with
the
composition
Mo4.31V1.36-
Te1.81Nb0.33O19.81 [12] has 0.19 of 2 Te-positions empty,
corresponding to a Te-deﬁciency of 9.5%.
The observation that Mo and Te are partly reduced in
propene ammoxidation (table 5 and ﬁgure 10) is in line
with Mo and Te sites taking part in the reaction mech-
anism [7]. That no reduction was observed of their
substituents W and Ce, respectively, can be due to these
elements being more diﬃcult to reduce (W) or that they
are more eﬃciently reoxidized (Ce), in agreement with
the discussion above (Section 4.2.). Overall, the present
results are also in general agreement with earlier reports
that Mo-sites in bismuth molybdates [7,27] and Te-sites
in Te-containing catalysts [34] are playing active roles in
the mechanism of propene ammoxidation.
5. Conclusions
In the basic orthorhombic, pseudo-hexagonal M2
structure (TeO)Mo2V1O9, W can substitute for Mo in
the whole range up to complete substitution without the
basic structure being changed. However, Ti can replace
merely half of the V, and Ce can replace up to about
30% of the Te. Moreover, substitution of Fe for V and
Nb for both Mo and V is possible up to at least the
20–30% level, although the upper substitution levels
were not determined for these elements.
The activity data for propene ammoxidation reveal
that substitution in the M2 structure of W for Mo and
Ce for Te both give catalysts with higher speciﬁc activity
and improved selectivity to acrylonitrile at the expense
of acrolein, maintaining the total selectivity to C3-partial
oxidation products constant. Replacement of V by Ti or
Nb exerts no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the product dis-
tribution, but increases the activity of the catalyst. In the
catalyst where Fe is substituted for V, the main role of
Fe seems to be that of burning acrolein. With regard to
both activity and selectivity to acrylonitrile formation, a
catalyst with 70% of the Mo replaced by W exhibits the
best performance.
According to XPS measurements the surfaces of the
catalysts are enriched with Te and with Ce, when pres-
ent. The enrichment parallels a corresponding decrease
of the surface concentration of V and also of W and Ti,
when present. In all cases the concentrations of Mo, Nb
and Fe at the surface are almost the same as in the bulk
of the material. The relative metal composition of the
surface remains unchanged after the catalyst has been
used in propene ammoxidation, although Mo and Te
are reduced.
The catalytic data together with the XPS data give
support for Mo, Te and their substituents W and Ce,
respectively, forming propene and ammonia activating
sites. Ti and Nb sites are mainly structure adjusting sites.
Besides W playing indirectly an active role in the
mechanism (inﬂuencing electronically the behavior of
the neighboring Mo sites), it is clearly also a structure-
adjusting element (site isolation) as evidenced by there
being an optimal Mo/W ratio giving the best catalytic
performance. Ce substitution exerts the classical redox
eﬀect on the base catalyst by increasing the activity.
Fe-sites are merely combustion sites.
