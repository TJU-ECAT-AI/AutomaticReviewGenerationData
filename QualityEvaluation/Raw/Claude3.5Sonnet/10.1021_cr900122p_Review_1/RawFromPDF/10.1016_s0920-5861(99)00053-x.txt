Abstract
The conversion of ethane to ethylene, aromatics, and oxygenates and combustion on supported metal oxide catalysts are
discussed. Updated information on the structure and performance of supported oxide catalysts in reactions is offered,
underlining the importance of in situ characterization under reaction conditions in order to fully understand the structure and
reactivity of supported metal oxide catalysts at molecular level. Support effects, the stability of supported oxide catalysts,
molecular structures and oxidation states under reaction conditions, and the effects of metal oxide and additive loading are
discussed. The role of terminal and bridging oxygen species is also addressed. Emphasis is placed on the relevance of surface
species vs. bulk structure and characterization. A section devoted to new trends in the selective oxidation of ethane to afford
high yields and lower working temperatures is included. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction
The heterogeneous catalytic oxidation on oxides is
extensively used in catalysis for selective and total
oxidation processes. However, the cost and availabil-
ity of feedstocks can seriously limit the process invol-
ving ole®ns because the raw materials constitute 60±
70% of the costs of production. This creates a strong
dependence on the raw materials market. Despite the
large reserves of alkanes from natural gas or as
lique®ed petroleum gas (LPG), except for the conver-
sion of butane to maleic anhydride on VPO catalysts
[1], no industrial process appears to be operative for
the conversion of alkanes. The activation of alkanes is
more dif®cult than that of the corresponding ole®ns,
but their large reserves underline the economic inter-
est in their conversion. The use of ole®ns and ole®n-
derived products is steadily increasing and their pro-
duction is mainly based on steam cracking and FCC
processes, which are energy intensive. At the same
time, the reserves of raw material for these processes
are becoming more and more limited. Consequently,
more abundant and economic sources for the produc-
tion of ole®ns must be sought. The reactivity of
feedstocks determines their ease of conversion. The
lower alkanes are the least reactive hydrocarbons, and
this has preserved them over time. Also, their low
reactivity has hindered their use in industrial pro-
cesses. Despite this, the increasing costs of traditional
feedstocks currently demands advances in the conver-
sion of paraf®ns. The selective conversion of paraf®ns

to aromatics, to ole®ns or to organic molecules con-
taining oxygen or nitrogen atoms is a source of many
chemical products. Ethane is the second major com-
ponent of natural gas, which makes it a potential
source of chemicals such as light ole®ns, oxygenates
and aromatic hydrocarbons [2]. The oxidation of
lower alkanes is a key issue in the use of natural
gas and volatile petroleum fractions as new feed-
stocks. The oxidation of ethane has been reported
to yield ethylene, aromatics and acetaldehyde or acetic
acid. Ethylene is mainly used for the production of low
density polyethylene (LDPE), high density PE, ethy-
lene dichloride, ethylene oxide, linear LDPE and
ethylbenzene, among other compounds. The aroma-
tization of ethane could extend the sources of aro-
matics and should offer an alternative route for the
separation of ethane from methane during the oxida-
tive coupling process ±OCM± since its recovery is
hard to accomplish [3,4]. The production of aromatics
is important owing to their use as a source of petro-
chemicals and also due to their high octane number.
Acetaldehyde has been used for the production of
acetic acid, but this process has now been replaced
by Monsanto carbonylation of methanol. Acetic acid
is mainly used for the production of vinyl acetate,
acetic anhydride and solvent esters. The development
of direct conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenate hydro-
carbons would provide an attractive alternative. In
turn, the processes of combustion eliminate toxic
compounds.
Catalysis by oxides is extensively used. The pre-
sence of a support is of economic interest and such
supports provide new means to tailor catalytic perfor-
mance by altering the exposure of the sites and
modifying their nature by interaction with the support.
This review addresses the results reported on the
conversion of ethane (partial oxidation, aromatization
and combustion) on supported oxides, assessing the
relevance of the catalyst formulation (support, active
phase, additive), the interaction with the support (spe-
ci®c support and coverage) and the reaction conditions
(type of oxidant, gas-phase additives) in a search for a
molecular understanding of the structure of the active
site and its activity. The transformation of catalyst
structure under reaction conditions and its implica-
tions in catalytic performance are discussed, under-
lining the need for the development and routine use of
in situ characterization methodologies. A further aim
of this review to present new concepts as regards
conversion of ethane since some of the most attractive
results have come from alternative means of activating
ethane.
1.1.
Nature of supported oxides
Supported oxides consist of an oxide deposited on
the surface of another oxide (support). The supported
oxide (M) binds to the support (S) via bridging M±O±S
bonds, which are formed in part by reaction with
surface hydroxyl groups [5,6]. For instance, surface
vanadia species present a terminal V=O bond and
three bridging oxygen to the support, or surface
molybdena species present a terminal Mo=O bond
and four bridging oxygens to the support [7,8]. Similar
structures are observed for other supported oxides [9].
Such structures are affected by ambient humidity,
which hydrolyzes the M±O±S bond, resulting in an
aqueous solution of the supported oxide. The chem-
istry of these species has been studied by several
authors [10±13], although this is not present under
ethane oxidation conditions, typically run above
573 K, where the catalyst remains essentially dehy-
drated. Some changes in the dehydrated structure may
occur during the reaction of ethane, however, the
structure is related to the dehydrated one [14], as in
the case of other alkane oxidation reactions [15±17].
Dehydrated supported oxide species are present as
surface isolated or bidimensional polymeric species,
and aggregate as crystals above the monolayer cover-
age. The dehydrated surface dispersed species are
stabilized by their interaction with the surface groups
of the support (hydroxyls), and the surface population
of hydroxyl sites determines the monolayer coverage
of the supported oxide. We consider the monolayer
coverage as the maximum loading at which the sup-
ported oxide is deposited as a surface species, free of
tridimensional aggregates. Pure geometric considera-
tion fail to provide correct estimations of the mono-
layer coverage since the chemical stabilization of the
surface species is not considered. For instance, a silica
(Cabot, 337 m2/g) with a much higher surface area
than an alumina (Engelhard, 222 m2/g) reaches mono-
layer coverage at 12% V2O5 (ca. 2 V atoms/nm2),
whereas a loading of 25% V2O5 is required on this
alumina to reach a monolayer coverage (ca. 13 V
atoms/nm2). For most oxides, surface monolayer
320

coverage is 5±10 times higher than for silica [18,19].
As the loading increases, the interaction among the
supported metal oxide species (M) increases, thus
resulting in surface polymeric species, characterized
by the formation of M±O±M bonds. Silica support
presents such a weak interaction with the supported
species, that only surface isolated or crystalline
supported oxide species are observed. At the loading
at which interactions among the surface isolated
species appear the silica alone is unable to stabilize
surface polymeric species and they aggregate into
tridimensional crystals.
The importance of compounds resulting from the
interaction of supported oxides with the support, like
silicomolybdic acid on silica-supported molybdenum
oxide catalysts can be excluded for ethane oxidation.
Those species are not stable above ca. 570 K, breaking
into surface molybdenum oxide species, as reported
by
several
authors
using
different
techniques
[11,12,20,21] and no relevance is, thus, expected from
silicomolybdic acid species for ethane oxidation, since
the reaction is run well above 570 K. By contrast, the
presence of additives affects the supported oxide.
Alkaline additives and impurities (Ca, Na, K, etc.)
tend to coordinate to acidic supported oxides (V, Mo,
W, etc.) by altering the M±O bonds [22±25]. Acidic
additives affect the structure of the supported species
since the support sites must be shared with a second
component, resulting in an effective increase in sur-
face coverage [26,27]. The interaction with P, for
supported vanadium oxide species may result in
VOPO4 if V is added prior to P; otherwise P coordi-
nates strongly on the support. However, if silica is the
support, its weak interaction with any supported spe-
cies will allow the formation of VOPO4 and of alkali
vanadates irrespective of the preparation procedure
[23,28±31], thus removing surface oxide species
[17,25,29±32].
1.2.
Activation of the hydrocarbon and selectivity
The activation of paraf®ns is harder than that of
other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the
former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily
oxidized under the conditions required to activate
paraf®ns, thus limiting selectivity [33,34]. The high
stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure.
The tetrahedral arrangement of C±H bonds protects
the carbon atoms. The C±H bonds are more exposed
than the C±C bonds of hydrocarbons and their clea-
vage should be the ®rst step in the transformation of
most hydrocarbons. The stronger the C±H bond is the
stronger the activation must be, and the dependence of
the optimal reaction temperature for selective oxida-
tion on the binding energy of the C±H bond follows
quite a linear trend for the lower alkanes [35]. The
C±H energy bond is highest for primary carbons
(Table 1), C±H bonds on secondary and tertiary car-
bons are more reactive and C3 hydrocarbons are
activated through these sites. However, all the carbons
in ethane are primary, which makes it much less
reactive than its larger homologues. The high disso-
ciation energy of the C±H bond of ethane vs. that of
other bonds in other molecules will affect the max-
imum selectivity attainable. By an extensive evalua-
tion of activity data reported for several oxidation
processes, Batiot and Hodnett have observed a corre-
lation of the selectivity with the differences between
the dissociation enthalpy of the weakest C±H bond
(D0HC±H) in the reactant hydrocarbon and that of the
weakest C±C or C±H bond of the product. Very high
selectivity is observed if the difference is less than
30 kJ/mol, while it is minimal above 70 kJ/mol. A
linear trend is observed for intermediate values, i.e., as
the stability of the product vs. that of the reactant
decreases
[36].

shows
the
dissociation
enthalpy of the weakest C±H and C±C bonds in the
products ethylene and acetaldehyde, together their
difference with the weakest C±H bond of ethane
(D0HC±H420 kJ/mol).
According
to
the
data
reviewed by Batiot and Hodnett, the conversion of
ethane to ethylene is expected to be highly selective,
with yields close to 50% (and some reports close to
60%). Burch [37] has also highlighted the lower
reactivity of ethylene as compared to ethane for
catalytic conversion. Conversely, the selectivity for

acetaldehyde is expected to be very low near 20%
conversion ([36] and references therein). So, the rela-
tive reactivity of the reactant and the product deter-
mines the limiting selectivity under conventional
reaction conditions. The formulation of the catalysts
will affect their interaction with the reactant and the
products. The activity of the hydrocarbons (both
reactant and product), the activation of the oxidant,
and the reactivity of lattice oxygen will determine how
close the performance of catalyst is to optimal selec-
tivity under conventional reaction conditions. Conse-
quently, the maximum selectivity appears to be
determined by the reaction, rather than by the catalyst.
The initial activation of the C±H bond of the
hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence
of an af®nity between the alkane and the surface of
the catalyst. The acid±base interaction between the
hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide
promotes the approach of the former to the active site
[33,38]. The surface acid/base features of an oxide
depend on the charge and radius of the cation. The
more oxidized the cation is, the more covalent the
bond with the oxide ion, thus increasing the acidity of
the oxide. Conversely, low valent cations result in a
more electron-rich oxygen species, thus being more
basic. The charges on the most reactive hydrogen atom
of the hydrocarbons shown in Table 1 were calculated
by Busca et al. [38]. Most of the alkanes have a
negative charge on the most reactive hydrogen, which
favors the interaction with electrophilic surfaces
(acidic oxides). However, ethane and methane do
not have a negative charge on the most reactive
hydrogen, thus altering the nature of the interaction
of these alkanes with the surface of the oxide as
compared with larger hydrocarbons [38±44]. Methane
clearly displays a positive charge on its H atoms and
its activation is most effective on basic oxides. A
certain correlation has been reported between the
strength of basic sites on the oxide surface and the
isotopic exchange reaction of methane with deuter-
ium, Ga2O3 being the most reactive of the series of
oxides tested by several orders of magnitude, and the
ZnO being the second most reactive [45]. However,
the rate of conversion of methane does not completely
correlate with H±D exchange [46]. Ethane has a
moderately positive charge in its H atoms, and prob-
ably, some stronger af®nity may be expected with
basic oxides than with acid ones, but no conclusive
trend has been reported in this line. Larger hydro-
carbons have a negative charge and should show
stronger interaction with acidic catalysts [38±44].
The af®nity between the hydrocarbon and the sur-
face promotes the activation of the molecules. Selec-
tivity is also determined by the hydrocarbon±catalyst
interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the
stability of surface hydrocarbon species. A strong
acid±base interaction with the support may also pro-
mote further degradation of partial oxidation products.
Thus, higher hydrocarbons require basic sites to pro-
mote selectivity to ole®ns [33] such as for butane
[22,47]. The appropriate use of alkaline additives
increases selectivity at a given conversion. Concep-
cio
Ân et al. [39] have shown that the selectivity to
ole®ns in a series of catalysts depends on their basic
character and on the speci®c hydrocarbon. N-butane
increases its selectivity in the order MgVAPO-5<VOx/
Al2O3<VAPO-5<VOx/MgOAl2O3<VOx/MgO; cor-
responding to a decrease in relative acidity, as deter-
mined by pyridine adsorption. This trend is reversed
for ethane, while propane shows no speci®c trend at all
[44]. In a different series (alkali-doped V2O5/TiO2),
the conversion in propane dehydrogenation decreases,
but the yield to propene increases, due to a decrease in
the heat of adsorption of propane [48]. The importance
of the strength of acid sites has been reported since
moderately acid sites promote the selective ODH of
ethane, whereas strong acid sites promote non-selec-
tive COx species [18,49±51]. The performance of the
catalyst is also affected by the acid±base character-
istics of the hydrocarbon vs. that of the catalyst. The
reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance,
because it determines how fast the surface intermedi-

ates react. For instance, very high oxygen mobility is
present in total oxidation catalysts, such as some
perovskites [52,53]. By contrast, non-reducible oxides
are much less reactive and require high reaction
temperatures. These high reaction temperatures result
in a signi®cant contribution of the gas-phase radical
reaction [37,54] and this is reported to promote ODH
products during ethane oxidation [33,43].
1.3.
Activation of the oxidant and selectivity
The oxidation of ethane involves activation of the
organic molecule and of the oxidant. Activation of the
oxidant depends on its nature. The activation of
molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible
oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of
dopants provides reducible sites for their activation
[52]. In addition, the non-reducible catalysts operate at
higher temperatures, which promotes the gas-phase
activation of O2 and C2H6 [37,54,55]. Molecular
oxygen activation on reducible oxides has been esti-
mated from the exchange of 18O2=16O2 isotopes [45],
which indicates the relative activation of oxygen on
the surface of the oxides. This information offers a
useful criterion for designing new catalysts [45]. The
amount of defects in oxides, which is affected by the
preparation method, strongly affects isotopic oxygen
exchange [52,56±58] and this affects reactivity [56].
Since the present focus is on supported oxides, the
properties of surface oxygen species are less sensitive
to preparation procedures and the oxygen exchange
properties are essentially affected by the surface cov-
erage and surface±oxide interaction determine their
properties. Chang et al. [59] have correlated the
single-step
double
exchange
between
gas-phase
18O2 and lattice 16O to form 16O2 with the activity
for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene on
zeolite-exchanged and supported transition metal oxi-
des. Both of them follow the trend: Co±H±ZSM-5
>Cu±Na±ZSM-5>V±ZSM-5>Nb±ZSM-5>Na±ZSM-5
H±ZSM-5Cu±ZSM-5.
The
formation
of
surface
diatomic oxygen species can be observed by in situ
Raman spectroscopy at moderate reaction tempera-
ture, but the band assignment is not conclusive [60]. In
any case, these bands are not present at reaction
conditions, thus suggesting that monoatomic surface
oxygen species along with lattice oxygen may be
involved in the conversion of ethane [60].
The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is
frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduc-
tion with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Some reports
show that the most selective catalysts are less redu-
cible although sometimes this trend is reversed. How-
ever, catalyst reducibility is often determined by bulk
reduction, which may differ from that of the surface
sites. Since catalysis is a surface phenomenon, the data
on catalytic performance should be correlated with the
parameters of surface reduction rather than with those
of bulk reduction. An interesting work by Valenzuela
et al. [61] pointed out the relevance of surface reduc-
tion for ethane ODH. The activity corresponds to the
surface reducibility determined by in situ XPS mea-
surements, but not with bulk reducibility, determined
by TPR. This observation is of key importance in
understanding the performance of bulk oxide cata-
lysts, but should also be considered for supported
metal oxide catalysts above monolayer coverage. In
addition to the relevance of surface vs. bulk reduci-
bility, it should also be noted that under reaction
conditions, the hydrocarbon and not molecular hydro-
gen is the reducing agent. The relevance of bulk
reduction vs. surface reduction and the nature of the
reducing molecule must account for some disagree-
ments found when connecting the activity and redu-
cibility
of
the
catalysts.
The
selectivity
and
reducibility do not appear to show a clear trend. Even
when a direct correlation if often observed between
reducibility of supported vanadium oxide species and
their activity, the oxidation state of the vanadium sites
under reaction conditions does not correspond with
the reducibility as observed by in situ Raman and Vis±
UV spectroscopy under ethane oxidation conditions
[14]. The average oxidation state of the vanadium site
under reaction conditions, re¯ects the balance in the
catalytic cycle of oxidation and reduction of the sites,
and this will signi®cantly affect the interaction with
the hydrocarbon since the redox and acid±base proper-
ties are affected by the oxidation state. Since the
oxidation state under oxidation conditions does not
correlate with the reducibility, it must account for the
lack of relation found between reducibility and selec-
tivity. In situ studies are required to fully understand
the factors affecting the selectivity.
The use of N2O instead of molecular oxygen has
proved to be more selective in the formation of C2-
oxygenates [31,62±66]. This appears to be due to the

strong activity of Oÿ species with alkanes at lower
temperatures than under molecular oxygen. Ward
et al. [63] observed the genesis of Oÿ species from
N2O but not from molecular oxygen upon interaction
with the catalyst surface according to EPR spectro-
scopy. They detected no radical alkyl species, which
suggests that radical species must readily transform
into diamagnetic species [63]. Modeling by Sinev et
al. [67] of the ethane-to-ethylene reaction requires
activation of the alkane by cleavage of a C±H bond by
surface-oxygen active species and a fast capture of
ethyl radicals by surface oxygen active sites; this
would account for the observations by Ward et al.
[63]. The activation of N2O seems to be related to the
capacity of the oxide to undergo electron transfer to
stabilize oxygen ions [52]. The reaction of Oÿ gen-
erated species with alkanes has been observed by EPR
[68]. The interaction of N2O with the catalyst is
different to O2 since nitrous oxide does not fully
reoxidize the catalyst under reaction conditions
[31,69] and the activation energy is different when
oxygen or nitrous oxide are used as oxidants for ODH
of ethane [70]. Additionally, the reaction in the pre-
sence of N2O appears to be less affected by the
modi®cation of the redox properties of the catalyst.
Supported-oxides, undoped and doped with K, afford
similar conversions of ethane under N2O. Conversely,
the activity decreases remarkably upon the addition of
K if the reaction in run under O2 [22,31,71], as
expected from the relevance of reducible sites for
the activation of molecular oxygen. Comparison of
both oxidants is hard since N2O requires lower opera-
tion temperatures than O2. At low temperature, N2O
has been reported to be more active than molecular
oxygen for the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde
on vanadium oxide catalysts, whereas the situation is
reversed at higher temperatures [72,73].
Reductive activation of the oxidant (oxygen or
nitrous oxide) with hydrogen signi®cantly increases
the conversion of ethane and decreases the reaction
temperature to the 573±773 K range. While the dehy-
drogenation predominates when oxygen is used as
oxidant, the use of nitrous oxide, or the addition of
hydrogen with any of the oxidants shift the product
distribution to the oxygenates ethanol, ethanal and
formaldehyde [66].
The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen spe-
cies is associated with the non-selective oxidation of
hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species
promote selective oxidation [52,53,74]. However,
combustion of ethane has been observed in the
absence of gas-phase oxygen, the oxide being the
only source of oxygen [53] since the mobility of
oxygen in the oxide is an additional factor determining
selectivity [52]. Factors governing the activation and
stability of the hydrocarbon and intermediates also
affect the activity and selectivity of the process.
1.4.
Experimental conditions
The temperature at which ethane ODH is run under
molecular oxygen may promote gas-phase conversion
of ethane, since this becomes signi®cant above 923 K
[37,44,55,57,75±81]. The participation of gas-phase
reaction should be prevented to avoid additional
sources of reactivity. This would confuse the evalua-
tion of catalytic performance. The relevance of the
gas-phase conversion is directly related to the amount
of void volume present in the reactor [55,78]. As the
surface-to-volume ratio of the reactor increases, the
relevance of gas-phase conversion of ethane is mini-
mized since radicals are terminated by collision with
the walls of the reactor or by adding inert packing to
the reactor that will scavenge the radicals. On the other
hand, the interaction with the walls of the reactor may
also provide further activation of ethane if the reactor
contains trace amounts of the catalyst. Consequently,
the contaminated walls themselves would act as a
catalyst, thus altering the catalytic evaluation [57].
The presence of water in the reaction feed, decreases
the conversion and increases the selectivity to oxygen
containing species [82].
The reaction under N2O occurs at lower tempera-
tures than under O2, which would prevent the parti-
cipation of gas-phase reactivity. The presence of
water, however, has a dramatic effect on the activity.
The presence of 25 Torr of water on silica-supported
molybdena catalysts under N2O decreases conversion
by 80% at 550 K while lower amounts of water have
no appreciable effect [63]. The presence of water
promotes the ODH of ethane in the gas-phase at
860 K under O2. At moderate reaction temperatures,
partial solvating of surface vanadium oxide species,
that would affect the catalytic properties, has been
observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy [83]. How-
ever, such hydration is not observed for silica-sup-
324
M.A. Ban
Äares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319±348
ported catalysts, due to the hydrophobic character of
silica, and no modi®cation in the structure of surface
molybdenum oxide species is expected. However, the
presence of large amounts of water must affect some-
how the activation of N2O into Oÿ species [63], since
Oÿ species are not observed by EPR on water-exposed
silica-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts under
N2O at 363 K [84]. However, 363 K is a rather low
temperature, and some surface hydration is expected
[83]. Hence, this experiment may not re¯ect the
reaction conditions. The addition of water to the feed
decreases the formation of ethylene and increases that
of CO and acetaldehyde, but has no effect on CO2
formation.

Ethane ODH and partial oxidation to
oxygenates
2.1.
Vanadium oxide-based catalysts
V-containing catalysts have been extensively used
in a large number of catalytic processes involving
selective oxidation reactions (such as the conversion
of butane to maleic anhydride, oxidation of o-xylene,
1,3-butadiene,
methanol,
CO,
ammoxidation
of
hydrocarbons, selective catalytic reduction of NO,
and the partial oxidation of methane) [25,34,85,86].
The applicability of vanadium-based catalysts for
ethane conversion are evident [87±90]. This section
will evaluate the relevance of several parameters on
the performance of supported vanadium oxide species.
2.1.1.
On the active oxygen site
Like other reactions, the terminal metal±oxygen
double bond has been proposed to be the active site
for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons [91,92], how-
ever, INDO calculations by Haber et al. [93] suggest
that the interaction of a hydrocarbon molecule is most
favorable with a bridging oxygen than with a terminal
one for vanadium oxide clusters. When the relevance
of the terminal V=O bond for ethane oxidation on
supported vanadium oxide catalysts at monolayer
coverage on several supports is evaluated by in situ
Raman spectroscopy, it turns out that the V=O bond
does not correlate with the changes of activity of the
catalysts, which are of one order of magnitude [18].
Similar results have been reported by Wachs and co-
workers for butane oxidation [15] and methanol oxi-
dation [94]. This would indicate that the terminal V=O
bond does not appear to be involved in the catalytic
oxidation of ethane. Furthermore, several experimen-
tal evidences support the relevance of bridging oxy-
gens for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. Initially,
studies on molybdenum oxide suggests that the oxy-
gen involved in catalytic selective oxidation is the
bridging one [95]. Combined Raman and isotopic
labeling on b-VOPO4 suggests that the V±O±P oxygen
is involved in the selective dehydrogenation of C4
hydrocarbons, while the contribution from the term-
inal V=O bond to this selective process appears to be
very reduced [96]. The same methodology allowed
Glaeser et al. [97] to show that the bridging Bi±O±Mo
in bismuth molybdate participates in the selective
oxidation of hydrocarbons. The contribution by Chaar
et al. [98] on magnesia±supported vanadia with high
selectivity for butane dehydrogenation evidence the
absence of terminal V=O bonds by IR spectroscopy. It
therefore appears that the terminal oxygen is not
critical for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.
In fact, an in situ isotopic Raman study with 18O2 by
Wachs and coworkers [15] revealed that the terminal
V18O bond is stable for nearly 20 times the char-
acteristic reaction time. More recently, the same group
has reported that, in different environments, vanadium
has the same activity irrespective of the presence of
the terminal V=O bond [99]. A very recent contribu-
tion by Dang et al. [100] on the dehydrogenation of
ethane on BaCO3±supported vanadia has demon-
strated the formation of Ba3(VO4)2, which is highly
selective (76% selectivity of ethylene at 34% conver-
sion at 923 K) and has no terminal V=O bonds. Thus,
it is the bridging bond that must be invoked to account
for this catalytic performance. All these results rule
out the terminal V=O bond as the critical active site of
supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the oxidation
of ethane.
2.1.2.
Support effect (V±O-support bond)
The oxygen species bridging surface vanadium
oxide species to the support may play a signi®cant
role in catalyst activity. A change in the support
changes the V±O±S bond and the catalytic perfor-
mance for ethane oxidation is affected by one order of
magnitude in the sequence TiO2>ZrO2Al2O3>
Nb2O5>CeO2±SiO2 [18]. The change in support alters

the TOF number by four orders of magnitude for
methanol oxidation and two orders of magnitude for
butane oxidation [15,94]. These results suggest that
the bridging V±O±S bond would be directly involved
in the reactivity of supported vanadium oxide species.
The evaluation of vanadium sites in different environ-
ments by Wang et al. [99] underlines the relevance of
the V±O±S bond for activity vs. the terminal V=O
bond. The nature of the V±O±S bond appears to be
critical for the oxidation of ethane. The activity order
is close to the reducibility of surface vanadium oxide
species on these supports, which correlates with the
Sanderson electronegativity of the cation of the oxide
support [14,101]. However, this trend follows as
CeO2>ZrO2±TiO2>Nb2O5>Al2O3>SiO2.
Ceria
and
niobia react with the supported vanadia, forming
new compounds that remove surface vanadia species
[14] thus decreasing their activity. The presence of an
acidic support (alumina) also increases activity but to
a lesser extent than a reducible support. The higher
reducibility results in a higher TOF number, but
oxidation state under reaction conditions does not
correspond with the reducibility, as observed by in
situ Raman and Vis±UV spectroscopy [14]. The sta-
bility of the supported vanadium oxide catalyst is an
important factor. Reducibility of V on SnO and CeO2
is high but the activity is low. When tin oxide is used as
a support for vanadium oxide it promotes its integra-
tion into the rutile lattice of SnO as V4 [102]. A
similar phenomenon takes place for titania±supported
vanadium oxide, which decreases its activity due to
integration of V4 sites into the rutile phase of titania,
along with the utilization of anatase phase [18,103±
105]. It should be noted that the lower activity of
rutile±supported vanadia is due to the integration of
vanadium species into rutile lattice, as the activity of
surface vanadium oxide species is not affected by the
speci®c oxide support phase [106]. It has been shown
that the structure (according to Raman spectroscopy
and
51V-NMR) and reactivity of surface vanadia
species for methanol oxidation is not affected for a
series of titania±supported vanadia on a series of
titania supports possessing different phases (anatase,
rutile, brookite and B) [106]. As commented above the
low TOF numbers for V2O5/Nb2O5 and V2O5/CeO2
are due to a solid state reaction with the support [14].
The effect of the acidity of the support in ethane
oxidation with molecular oxygen on supported vana-
dium oxide catalysts has been explored by Le Bars et
al. [51] and Wan and coworkers [50]. Activity
decreases in the order V5±ZSM-5>V5±APO-5
>V5/AlPO4>V5/silicalite>V5/silica
[50].
This
trend corresponds to the number of acidic sites. All
the catalysts show comparable selectivity of ethylene
and CO. The higher activity of ZSM-5±supported
vanadium oxide catalyst is also related to the large
amount of CO2 that may arise from over oxidation of
partial oxidation products inside the microporous
structure. The stronger acidity observed for P-contain-
ing catalysts appears to be due to the P±O±V bond,
since XPS technique reveals a strong electron with-
drawing effect on vanadium sites [50]. The higher
activity of V±APO-4 catalyst is also related to the
higher ease of reoxidation [50].
Both, acid±base and redox properties affect the
conversion of ethane. Lo
Âpez-Nieto and coworkers
[39,107] have reported the equilibrium required
between reducibility and the acid±base character of
the sites. These authors studied the activity of highly
dispersed surface vanadium oxide species on alumina,
magnesia, mixed magnesia±alumina, and vanadium
oxide-containing microporous material. As in other
reports [18,30,40,61,71,108], the activity under O2
runs parallel to the reducibility of the catalysts, which
decreases thus: V2O5/Al2O3>VAPO-5>MgAVPO-5
V2O5/MgO>V2O5/MgOAl2O3.
However,
the
selectivity of ole®ns depends on the acidity of the
catalysts,
which
increases
as
V2O5/MgO<V2O5/
MgOAl2O3<VAPO-5<V2O5/Al2O3<MgVAPO-5,
as determined by pyridine adsorption
[39,107].
Michalakos et al. [40] have observed the same trend
for supported vanadia catalysts with Mg or P. It has
also been reported that for vanadium oxide and mag-
nesium oxide supported on APO-5 catalysts [109] the
acid±base and redox function must be near the V sites.
Modi®cation of vanadium sites reducibility with Co
on CoVAPO-5 further increases activity while ODH
selectivity remains reasonably high [107]. The bene-
®cial effect of Co is also an expected result in view of
the temperature-programmed isotopic exchange stu-
dies by Chang et al. [49] on several ZSM-5-based
catalysts. This con®rms that also reducibility and
acid±base properties determine the performance for
ODH. The former is related to the activation of the
hydrocarbon, but the ability to activate oxygen (iso-
topic exchange) provides additional reactivity.

2.1.3.
Surface vanadium oxide coverage effect
(V±O±V bonds)
Surface coverage alters the population ratio of
(V±O±V)/(V±O-support) bonds. This trend is not
observed on silica-supported vanadia, where isolated
surface vanadium oxide species are dominant up to
monolayer coverage. V±O±V bonds appear to be
involved in ethane oxidation, as observed by in situ
Raman spectroscopy [14]. The same trend has been
observed under butane oxidation [16]. Surface cover-
age has a much lower effect than the nature of the
support oxide. However, the environment of surface
vanadium oxide species must affect the activity of the
oxide catalysts, since neighboring surface vanadium
oxide species promote the reducibility, thus increasing
the activity. At very low surface coverage on alumina,
the addition of vanadium decreases acidity, as the
alumina sites are covered [110]. Above monolayer
coverage, no further increase of acid sites is observed.
Activity increases with V loading on alumina±sup-
ported vanadia catalysts but the TOF number remains
essentially constant [14,18,44,111]. Selectivity is
affected by alumina coverage: at low vanadium cover-
age, carbon dioxide is the main oxidation product,
mainly due to the alumina sites. At higher V loading
the alumina sites are titrated by surface vanadium
oxide species and the selectivity increases reaching
a yield of 21% for the 3.3% V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst. At
very high V loading tridimensional bulk-like vanadia
species are dominant. Their catalytic performance
yields ODH products and non-selective COx species.
The surface coverage of vanadium on alumina modi-
®es the acidic and basic features of the catalyst
[110,111]. The TOF number on silica±supported vana-
dium is constant up to ca. 5% V2O5/SiO2 and
decreases at higher loading due to the formation of
vanadia crystals [14,111]. A similar trend has been
observed for methane conversion to oxygenates [112]
with vanadium loading on silica. In general, selectivity
is affected by the coordination of vanadium oxide sites
since the presence of V±O±V bonds with increasing
coverage of vanadium decreases the selectivity to
ethylene [18,39], it may be due to a larger number
of active sites that may attack the hydrocarbon mole-
cule. In fact, the site isolation proves to improve
selectivity [33,34]. In this line, it is interesting to note
that the best selectivities are reached on silica±sup-
ported oxides. It should be noted that no surface
polymeric species are observed in silica±supported
vanadia under dehydrated conditions, and only surface
isolated vanadium oxide species are present up to
monolayer coverage as measured by Raman and
51V-NMR spectroscopy [7,8] and by 51V-NMR and
TPR measurements [113]. This is not the case on other
supports like alumina. Oyama and Somorjai [114]
have observed lower selectivity at low surface vana-
dium loading on silica. At high surface coverage,
ethylene is the main oxidation product whereas at
low surface coverage CO2 is the main oxidation
product. However, no characterization of these cata-
lysts has been provided to explain why these vanadia
silica catalysts show trends different from those of
other silica±supported catalyst series. The formation
of selective oxygen-containing products (mainly acet-
aldehyde) is only observed at high vanadia surface
coverage on silica by these authors [114].
2.2.
Molybdenum oxide-based catalysts
Silica±supported molybdenum oxide was tested for
ethane oxidation with nitrous oxide by Ward et al.
[63]. EPR and XPS experiments showed that partially
reduced Mo5 species are directly related to the active
site. They proposed that c.u.s. Mo5 species would be
the active site and that nitrous oxide would be acti-
vated to Oÿ species, which readily react with ethane to
yield ethylene at reaction temperatures below 573 K.
The absence of paramagnetic signals for surface ethyl
radical rules out the presence of long-lived radical
intermediates [63], in agreement with the foreseen
rapid reaction of surface oxygen species [67]. If
molecular oxygen is used instead of nitrous oxide,
activity is very low and a certain activity is only seen at
higher temperatures. By contrast, molybdenum oxide
species are visibly oxidized, which is not the case
under N2O. A completely oxidized MoO3/SiO2 cata-
lyst is not active for the oxidation of ethane [115]. In
fact, the activity of MoO3/SiO2 in O2 is comparable to
that of pure silica [116]; thus, MoO3/SiO2 is not active
for ethane oxidation in molecular oxygen at low
temperatures. The presence of water vapor is essential
for high selectivity to acetaldehyde. Surface molyb-
denum coverage on silica is of crucial importance for
the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. No sys-
tematic study has been carried out yet on the effect of
the support for supported molybdena, but the Mo±O-
M.A. Ban
Äares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319±348
327
support bond has been proposed as the critical bond
for methanol oxidation [6], it is expected that it will
also be the critical site for ethane oxidation, as in the
case of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. It appears
that surface molybdenum oxide species interacting
with silica are active for acetaldehyde formation. At
higher loading a tridimensional molybdenum oxide
structure is expected to dominate. At this molybdena
loading the selectivity is lower [39,42]. As for other
oxides, the oxide used as a support affects the per-
formance of the supported molybdenum oxide spe-
cies, but to a lesser extent than in the case of vanadium
oxide [101]. The very different trends with molecular
oxygen or nitrous oxide as oxidants point to the
existence of different mechanisms for each oxidant.
The reaction is of ®rst order with respect to N2O but
zero order with respect to O2. As reported by several
authors, N2O is more active than O2 at low tempera-
ture, whereas at high reaction temperature this reac-
tivity order is reversed [30,62,70,71].
2.3.
Alkaline and metal additives
Alkali doping has afforded positive effects in many
catalytic processes, like the synthesis in ammonia, the
oxidation of SO2 to SO3, or the dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzne to styrene, among others [117]. As
regards supported metal oxides, alkaline additives
tend to coordinate to acidic surface species (V, Mo,
etc.), affecting the V±O bonds [22±25,118]. The pre-
sence of alkaline additives has a bene®cial effect for
the dehydrogenation of larger hydrocarbons due to a
modi®cation on the acid±base interaction of the
hydrocarbon with the catalyst [37], but this trend
reverses for ethane [44]. If silica is the support,
compounds form readily with alkaline additives,
due to the very weak interaction of silica with the
supported species [17,25,29±32]. The new compounds
arising from this interaction show different perfor-
mance due to new structural, acid±base and redox
properties. Thus, Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs on silica±
supported vanadium oxide form the corresponding
vanadates, as reported by Erdo
Èhelyi and Solymosi
[31]. Except for KVO3/SiO2, all the catalysts undergo
deactivation slowly during the oxidation of ethane
with N2O. The deactivated catalyst can be regener-
ated, except NaVO3/SiO2, by oxidation at 773 K.
NaVO3 is not stable above 720 K and decomposes.
The rest of the alkali-vanadate catalysts have higher
stability than silica±supported vanadia catalysts and
the formation of acetaldehyde and CO2 is consider-
ably higher, while that of ethylene and CO decreases
for the oxidation of ethane with oxygen [22]. The
addition of K decreases the activity of alumina±sup-
ported vanadium oxide catalysts under O2 (Table 3)
[22], contrary to the effects of alkaline additives
observed by Solymosi [30,31] when N2O was used
as oxidant.
The marked difference in performance of V2O5/
Al2O3 and V2O5/SiO2 catalysts upon addition of K
must arise from the kind of oxidant used since it has
been reported that nitrous oxide activation only
requires single isolated sites [52], whereas the activa-
tion of molecular oxygen may have further require-
ments. The presence of alkaline additives of silica±
supported molybdenum oxide catalysts has a similar
effect to that observed for vanadia-based catalysts
[119]. Activity remains comparable when nitrous
oxide is the oxidant, while it decreases remarkably
when the oxidant is molecular oxygen. The presence
of alkaline additives affects the redox properties of
supported oxides (Mo or V) [17,22,30,71,119]. In the
presence of oxygen, the reaction appears to involve
redox cycles in the oxide catalysts. The addition of
alkaline dopants decreases the extent of the redox
properties of the supported oxide, thus decreasing
the performance. The reaction in the presence of
nitrous oxide does not appear to involve a redox cycle
in the oxide and the interaction of N2O oxidant with
the catalysts does not appear to be decreased by
alkaline additives. However, for both oxidants the
selectivity to COx products is higher than in alkali-
free supported oxides. The larger production of COx
products may be associated with the higher basicity of
the catalyst, which should alter the interaction
between the hydrocarbon and the catalyst surface [39].
Erdo
Èhelyi and Solymosi [29,119,120] evaluated the
performance of alkali-molybdates supported on silica.
All the alkali molybdates showed similar reducibility,
which was much lower than that of silica±supported
bulk molybdena. The number of basic sites increases
from Li to Cs molybdate. Silica±supported molybdena
deactivates during the oxidation of ethane with nitrous
oxide. The catalysts are reactivated by reoxidation.
Cs-, Rb-, and K-molybdates are active under the same
conditions, but Na- and Li-molybdates show no
328

Äares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319±348
improvement. The yield to acetaldehyde increases
with cation size, but decrease with time, like the yield
of CO2. However, ethylene remains constant. The
deactivation is due to an increasing reduction of the
catalyst, which is regenerated upon reoxidation [29].
Again, water vapor favors acetaldehyde formation,
especially for Rb2MoO4 (selectivity increases from
20% to 33%). The data presented by Erdo
Èhelyi and
Solymosi suggest the relevance of acid sites for ethane
oxidative dehydrogenation and of basic sites for acet-
aldehyde
formation.
Comparison
with
ZnMoO4,
MgMoO4 and MnMoO4 further evidences these trends
[119].
The addition of acidic niobia has no effect on the
structure
of
supported
vanadium
oxide
species
[25,121], it simply increases the surface density of
vanadia sites [25]. This increases the amount of sur-
face polymeric species, except for silica, where no
surface polymeric species are observed [25]. The
addition of niobia to vanadia titania catalysts modi®es
the redox properties and increases the acidic proper-
ties of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst; this increases the
selectivity to ethylene [121]. This would suggest a
bene®cial effect of acidic sites for the ethylene, but
more results are required to fully substantiate this
statement for the oxidation of ethane.
2.4.
Phosphorus-containing catalysts
2.4.1.
Catalysts containing V and P
Merzouki et al. [122] evaluated the performance of
VPO catalysts. If the P/Vatomic ratio is 1.15/1 activity
is very low and acetic acid is the only product formed
at low temperature. Increasing the oxygen-to-ethane
ratio in the feed increases the acetic acid-to-ethylene
selectivity ratio but has no effect on carbon dioxide
formation. Doping the VPO catalysts with Te (Te/
V10%) decreases the selectivity of the catalyst.
Conversely,
Pd-doped
VPO
(Pd/V0.15±1%)
increases activity with Pd loading; acetic acid is
already observed at 473 K and acetic anhydride at
573 K. However, the most remarkable feature of Pd-
doped VPO catalysts is that, as conversion increases,
ethylene becomes the main oxidation product with
selectivity above 90% at ca. 12% conversion. The
addition of Te yields a new structure of Te2V2O9 along
with the (VO)2P2O7 phase, whereas Pd-doped VPO
catalysts show no new compounds with Pd. However,
only the very ®rst layers are directly involved in the
reaction. The presence of Te promotes the V5 oxida-
tion state and Pd results in 95% of V4. This may
account for the different performances observed after
doping with Pd or Te (Fig. 1). It has been proposed
that the high af®nity of metallic Pd for H2 accounts for
the high selectivity of ethylene.
Tessier et al. observed that among bulk VPO cat-
alysts (aVOPO4, (VO)2P2O7 and VO(PO3)2) only
VO(PO3)2 appears to oxidize ethane to acetic acid.
Acetic acid selectivity is 100% up to 573 K, but
activity is very low (<0.1%) and decreases rapidly
over time [123]. Supporting this VPO catalyst on
titania support prevents deactivation for atleast ®ve
days on stream. Conversion is higher and acetic acid is
observed at 473 K, but its selectivity decreases with
conversion (temperature). High pressure (10 bar)
increases the production of acetic acid. The effect

of high pressure, shifting the reaction towards oxyge-
nate formation, has been observed in the homoge-
neous conversion of ethane by Gesser et al. [124]. As
in other catalysts, the presence of water vapor also
promotes the formation of acetic acid [71,78,82,122].
Santamarõ
Âa-Gonza
Âlez et al. [125] have just reported
the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on vanadium
oxide supported on layered a-titanium phosphate (a-
TiP). This is a selective catalyst for ethylene produc-
tion, with negligible production of CO2. The partici-
pation of the gas-phase reaction was prevented and the
catalyst is stable on stream for atleast 24 h. A strong
interaction between Vand P sites is seen with XPS. In
situ Raman spectra provide evidence about the for-
mation of a new surface compound, which is not
formed under calcination of the precursor of the
catalyst. The reaction conditions, promote the rear-
rangement of the surface vanadium oxide and surface
phosphate species forming the VOPO4 phases [125].
The formation of this new phase must be associated
with the transient period during which activity
increases, and the selectivity of ethylene increases
at the expense of the non-selective CO2 (Fig. 2).
The bridging V±O±P sites formed under reaction
conditions must provide the new selective site, which
further supports the results reported by Lashier at al.
[96] on the relevance of the V±O±P bonds for the
selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. The vanadium
oxide supported on layered Zr phosphate is less active,
but selectivity is still high [126]. The relevance of P as
additive has been observed for V-based catalysts on
alkane oxidation reactions [16,34].
2.4.2.
Catalysts containing Mo and P
As in the case of V, the presence of P results in a new
catalytic performance for Mo-based catalysts. Thus,
Hong and Moffat [62] evaluated the performance of
12-molybdophosphoric acid (HPMo) for ethane oxi-
dation. The relevance of bulk heteropoly acids in
catalysis is well-known [127]; similarly to oxides,
the use of a support has several advantages: Moffat
and coworkers had already reported the bene®ts of
supporting heteropolyacids, since the activity for this
reaction increases by a factor of 10 [128]. Non-polar
molecules such as ethane are unable to penetrate into
the large bulk structure of heteropolycompounds.
However, this interaction can be facilitated by depos-
iting the 12-molybdophosphoric acid onto a suitably
high-area support. Loading of ca. 20 wt% allows
highly exposed heteropolyacids (small aggregates),
such as 12-molybdophosphoric acid to become acces-
sible to ethane molecules, while high surface loading
leads to large aggregate formation of HPMo on the
silica, rendering a signi®cant amount of the catalyst
inaccessible to the ethane molecules [62]. Acetalde-
hyde and ethylene are the main oxidation products (ca.
44% and 41% selectivity, respectively) on silica±sup-
ported 12-molybdophosphoric acid. The catalysts
show some deactivation during time on stream, but
this is quite moderate at low reaction temperatures

(650 K). This could be due to decomposition of the
heteropolyacid into the constituting oxides. The
kinetic orders for ethane and nitrous oxide were 0.7
and 0.6, respectively. TCM was added to increase
activity, but did not signi®cantly alter the selectivity
trends. Cavani et al. [2] found a similar trend during
HCl pulses. The use of chlorine-based additives to
promote activity is discussed below. The lower selec-
tivity under molecular oxygen is again evidenced here,
since it decreases to a third the selectivity of acet-
aldehyde and increases that of CO [2,128]. The selec-
tivity trends suggest that ethylene and acetaldehyde
are primary products. Pulse experiments support the
notion that acetaldehyde is essentially associated with
a catalytic process while ethylene participates from
gas-phase reactions [41] and this may account for the
shift in selectivity trends to ethylene from acetalde-
hyde as reaction temperature increases [62].
The relevance of different formulations of hetero-
polyoxometallates has been recently studied by
Moffat et al. [41] and by Cavani et al. [2] in view
of the possibility of tuning the acid±base and redox
properties of these compounds. Since structural
stability under reaction conditions may be limited,
the addition of Sb (1 Sb atom per Keggin unit)
stabilizes the structure of 12-molybdophosphoric acid
by ca. 90 K, but catalytic activity decreases as Mo5 is
stabilized, thus limiting redox functionality [2,129].
The incorporation of Cr or Ce to the Keggin unit did
compensate the redox properties if the loading values
were below 0.5 atoms per Keggin unit. A higher
amount of Ce further increases activity, but selectivity
decreases markedly. Cr addition follows trends similar
those to Ce. Partial replacement of Mo by W improves
the performance by addition of up to one W atom per
Keggin unit [2]. In addition, tungstophosphoric acid
structure presents higher acidity than molybdopho-
sphoric structures, as predicted from extended Hu
Èckel
calculations [130] and determined experimentally
[41]. The acid±base properties can also be tailored
by the addition of P, which increases surface acidity,
thus favoring ethylene formation. The addition of a
second cation also in¯uences morphological proper-
ties [41]. The combined use of Sb and K stabilizes the
structure, while selectivity remains completely unaf-
fected [2,129]. The heteropolymolybdates tested by Li
and Ueda [131] show a 10% selectivity of acetic acid
at 1% conversion.
2.4.3.
Mo and V P-based catalysts
V±Mo phosphates, VPO and MoPO materials sup-
ported on titania±anatase were evaluated for the con-
version of ethane to acetic acid by Roy et al. [132].
Pure bulk (VO)2P2O7 and (Mo)2P2O7 show very low
activity (0.2% conversion) and do not produce acetic
acid. The activity of VPO catalysts appears to be
associated with the presence of extended defects
[133]. The use of a support for VPO catalysts is
expected to increase the exposure of the sites and to
promote the formation of defects in the VPO structure,
thus increasing its activity. The Mo±V phosphate
catalyst supported on titania is active for acetic acid
formation and presents low selectivity of ethylene.
The best performance corresponds to a Mo±V phos-
phate on titania±anatase at low surface coverage.
Raman spectroscopy shows that molybdenum and
vanadium oxide species spread onto the support as
surface dispersed oxide species, thus accounting for
the coverage of the titania surface sites. The relevance
of reaction conditions in the spreading of metal oxides
has been observed with in situ Raman spectroscopy
[134]. In this sense, it is interesting to note that above
1.610ÿ2 (MoV)/Ti loading activity decreases
(Table 4), possibly indicating that the surface disper-
sion of V and Mo species is no longer possible due to
saturation of the titania sites. This points to the
relevance of the titania support for the generation of
active sites, and strongly suggests that active species
are surface sites formed by decomposition of the
phosphate compound. Several studies suggest that
the active sites of VPO catalysts are associated with
the formation of surface species formed under reaction
and interacting with the VPO substrate [14,135].
2.5.
Boron oxide based catalysts
The oxidation of ethane to acetaldehyde is essen-
tially accomplished using nitrous oxide as an oxidant,
but the need for a catalyst able to convert ethane into
C2 oxygenates in the presence of molecular oxygen is
evident. The group of Otsuka evaluated the perfor-
mance of the oxidation of ethane with molecular
oxygen of the oxides of B, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V,
Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd,
In, Sn, Sb, Te, Ba, La, Ce, W, Pb, and Bi. Only the
oxides of B, Al and Si produced oxygenates. However,
alumina and silica produced mainly COx. Supporting

B on alumina, magnesia, lanthanum and P2O5
improved the catalytic performance of boria [116].
Boria on alumina and on zinc oxide were the most
active catalysts. The yield of ethylene was near 14.5%
for both catalysts, but the highest yield of acetalde-
hyde in the alumina-supported series (1.03%) is
attained with by B2O3/Al2O3, whereas zinc±supported
boria produce no detectable amounts of acetaldehyde.
It is interesting to note that B2O3/P2O5 and B2O3/TiO2
show very high selectivity to ethylene (89.7% and
98.0%, respectively). As boria loading on alumina
increases, both conversion and selectivity increase
since B covers non-selective alumina sites in a similar
fashion
to
other
alumina-supported
oxides
[14,44,110]. Microcalorimetric evaluation of the acid-
ity of alumina and boria±alumina materials performed
by Colorio et al. [76,136] reveal that strong acid sites
of the alumina support were replaced by a large
number of weak acid sites upon addition of boria.
At the same time, the conversion of ethylene and the
selectivity for acetaldehyde increases with boria con-
tent up to a boria loading of 30% on alumina, where
tridimensional boria aggregates are evident and sur-
face area decreases markedly. The presence of highly
dispersed B oxide species interacting with alumina,
evidenced by XPS, is associated with the formation of
acetaldehyde whereas the crystalline boria is asso-
ciated with the ODH reaction [116]. The most remark-
able feature is that highly dispersed boron on alumina
performs for the oxidation of ethane with molecular
oxygen at a level comparable with that of silica±
supported molybdena with nitrous oxide as oxidant.
The data presented by the authors indicate that two
kinds of sites are present on boria±alumina catalysts:
those leading to the ODH reaction and those leading to
the formation of C2 oxygenates. COx and CH4 appear
to be formed from acetaldehyde, as suggested by yield
trends vs. residence time. The dominant mechanism
appears to be radical, since boria may not participate
in redox cycles. It is proposed that ethane is activated
through the abstraction of H by adsorbed electrophilic
oxygen species; a second H-abstraction should form
ethylene. Reaction of the ethyl radical with molecular
oxygen forms ethylperoxy radical, which must be in
equilibrium with ethyl radicals in the gas-phase. Reac-
tion with ethyl radicals forms ethylhydroperoxy radi-
cals which may decompose to ethylene or to
acetaldehyde. This appears to be the faster route to
ethylene. According to the calculations by Sinev et al.
[67] on the oxidation of ethane on PbO/Al2O3 cata-
lysts, the ethyl species formed from ethane react fast
with surface O species and the O±containing surface
intermediates can yield ODH products. The presence
of oxygenate precursors of hydrocarbons has also been
reported for methane formation by in situ IR and MS
studies [137]. As observed by Otsuka et al. [116], the
boria±alumina catalyst showed no deactivation, and it
is interesting to note that the preparation method
(impregnation and chemical vapor deposition of the
boron oxide precursor on alumina) revealed no differ-
ences in the catalytic performance below monolayer
coverage. However, no acetaldehyde formation was
reported by these authors.
Otsuka et al. evaluated the use of BPO4 catalysts for
ethane oxidation. Acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, COx
and ethylene were observed [133]. Pure BPO4 is not
active but treatments under reaction feed over 20 h at
823 K results in an active system [138] with a selec-
tivity for acetaldehyde of 54.5%. Experimental evi-
dence suggests that surface boron oxide species

interacting with a BPO4 structure must be the active
site for acetaldehyde formation. A similar phenom-
enon has been observed for boron on MFI zeolites
under propane oxidation [139]. The formation of the
aldehyde increases with B doping up to a critical
loading value where crystalline boria is expected to
develop and ethylene becomes the dominant product
at the expense of acetaldehyde [138]. This is consis-
tent with the performance previously observed for
bulk boria on alumina. The nature of the boron species
and its mechanism for the oxidation of ethane to
acetaldehyde has been calculated using quantum che-
mical cluster calculations. Under reaction conditions,
pure BPO4 is expected to rearrange its surface, gen-
erating Lewis acid three-coordinated boron sites
[138], while the four-coordinated B inside the BPO4
structure is inactive because it is not accessible [140].
Ethane adsorbs dissociatively on the Lewis acid boron
site and the subsequent incorporation of molecular
oxygen forms an alkyl peroxy complex which is
stabilized on the surface Lewis acid three-coordinated
B sites. It desorbs as acetaldehyde. At high boron
loading, crystalline boria is expected to dominate.
However, B-doped BPO4 is unstable in the presence
of water vapor above 823 K. Other elements, such as
Mg-, Ca-, and Zn-doped BPO4 are stable under water
vapor above 823 K. These pure additives are less
active than BPO4, but the performance of Mg-, Ca-,
and Zn-doped BPO4 is comparable to B-doped BPO4
[141]. These additives decrease the apparent activa-
tion energy of ethane and increase the selectivity of
acetaldehyde at low surface coverage on BPO4 sub-
strate. The active site must be surface-interacting Mg,
Ca and Zn species on the BPO4 substrate. Quantum
calculations show the effect of the element M
(MMg, Ca, Zn) on the =B±O±M= bond. The addi-
tion of M affects the basicity of the oxygen ion near B
and correlates with the decrease in the apparent acti-
vation energy of ethane [142].
2.6.
Supported multicomponent oxides
The use of mixed oxide catalysts is a very versatile
method to tailor the catalytic properties. Thorsteinson
et al. showed its applicability for ethane oxidation
using mixed oxides of V and Mo, together with other
transition metal oxides. The MoVNb formulation
appeared to be the most ef®cient for the production of
ethylene and acetic acid from ethane [143]. These
authors claimed a 50% conversion of ethane and a
68% selectivity of ethylene at 673 K. More recently,
thiscatalyticsystemhasbeenfurtherexaminedbyBurch
etal.[144]andbyDespondsetal.[145],focusingmainly
on the relevance and role of Nb in the redox properties.
The presence of a third element signi®cantly improves
theperformanceofthebinaryMoVcatalyst.Theadvan-
tagesofNbasathirdcomponentforethaneoxidationhas
recently been reported by Jua
Ârez-Lo
Âpez et al. [146] for
VSb-based multicomponent oxides. As in the former
reports, the modi®cation of redox properties and the
possible formation of new mixed oxide phases are
determining factors for the selectivity, while the pre-
sence of pure phases is detrimental for selective oxida-
tion. The use of alumina-supported catalysts based on
bulk MVNb (MCo, Ni, Bi, Sn) has been reported
[61,147]. The work by Valenzuela et al. stresses appro-
priate determination of catalyst reducibility, since TPR
methodology evaluates bulk reduction and the reduci-
bility of surface sites may not correspond to that of the
bulk sites. Surface reducibility has been determined by
XPS. Evaluation of alumina±supported NiV, NiVSb,
and SbV oxides show that the selectivity of ethylene
does not correlate with bulk reducibility, determined by
TPR, but does correlate with surface reducibility, deter-
mined by XPS [61]. No interference from gas-phase
reaction is expected, since the datawere obtained below
773 K, and void volume was absent in the reactor.
Accordingly, the results correspond to a pure catalytic
process. Surface reducibility and ethylene selectivity
follow
the
trend
NiVSb/Al2O3>SbV/Al2O3>NiV/
Al2O3, whereas bulk reducibility, as determined
by
TPR,
follows
the
trend
NiV/Al2O3>NiVSb/
Al2O3>SbV/Al2O3. Relative activity follows the trend
NiV/Al2O3±SbV/Al2O3>NiVSb/Al2O3,whichdoesnot
correspond to surface or bulk reducibility.
2.7.
Activation by Cl and Cl-containing catalysts
The methane molecule has been successfully acti-
vated using chlorine. As the rate of reaction of Cl with
ethane is 600-fold higher than with methane [148], its
relevance in ethane oxidation is expected to be
remarkable. Additionally, Cl-promoted catalysts show
very low activity as regards further oxidation of
ethylene [149,150]. The use of organochloride addi-
tives increases the oxidation of ethane. Recently Hong
M.A. Ban

and Moffat [62] have reported the effect of TCM for
ethane oxidation on silica±supported 12-molybdopho-
sphoric acid. Addition of TCM to the feed up to
0.4% mol increases conversion continuously, and
selectivity remains largely unaffected; nearly 45%
for acetaldehyde and 35% for ethylene. Surface Cl
species appear to be formed and remain for some time
in basic oxides [151], although this does not appear to
be the case of heteropolyoxometallates [2]. Fig. 3
shows the selectivity of ethylene and the conversion
of ethane before, just after, and after the pulse of Cl
precursor (TCM or HCl). While MgO has higher
activity
after
1 h,
this
is
not
the
case
for
K2P1.2Mo10W1Sb1Fe1Cr0.5Ce0.75On. Rare earth oxi-
des show different trends under operation with
TCM. La2O3, Sm2O3 or Pr6O11 displays very moder-
ate changes in the activity and ethylene selectivity.
Some increase in the CO/CO2 selectivity ratio results
for Pr6O11, but CeO2 is by far the most affected. At
773 K its activity almost doubles [152], and the
selectivity of ethylene increases almost four times
at the expense of COx species and the deep oxidation
product, CO2, is largely reduced.
The addition of DCM may also exert an effect in the
homogeneous reaction, along with the surface mod-
i®cation of the catalysts. At high reaction tempera-
tures (998±1098 K), where the gas-phase reaction
appears to be dominant, no effect of the addition of
DCM is observed, because the reaction conditions are
suf®cient to activate ethane and further activation by
DCM may not be appreciable. Burch et al. [150] have
shown that the addition of CH3Cl has no effect of pure
gas-phase oxidation of ethane with oxygen, leaving
the effect of Cl to the modi®cation of surface sites by
interaction with chlorine species. Heteropolyacids
may be affected only under Cl-feed. By contrast, this
modi®cation appears to be rather stable for magnesia
and samaria. Hours after the organochloride promoter
feed has been discontinued, activity remains high (ca.
three times higher), indicating a possible modi®cation
of the surface of the catalyst and thus creating new
sites essentially active and selective for ethane con-
version [151]. Furthermore, the formation of a layer of
MnCl2 on K/Mn2O3 catalysts has been observed upon
addition of chloroform to the reaction feed, under
OCM reaction conditions [153]. Addition of DCM
to the reaction feed for Mg3(PO4)2 in the temperature
range 723±823 K increased the selectivity of ethylene
by a factor of 5 [75]. The promoting effect appears to
be associated with the formation of chlorine com-
pounds with Mg on the surface of the catalysts, as
evidenced by the performance for ethane oxidation of
Mg3(PO4)2 catalysts pretreated in TCM and by the
interaction of Cl with the catalysts evidenced by XPS
measurements of the catalysts after reaction. In situ
characterization under reaction conditions should pro-
vide a better understanding of the surface transforma-
tion of the catalysts under chlorine feed.
The
chlorine-containing
catalysts
studied
for
methane oxidative coupling show very low activity
for conversion of ethene vs. ethane [150,154]. Thus, a
highly selective activity for ethane oxydehydrogena-
tion would be expected. Additionally, the presence of
chlorine in some catalysts triggers the reactivity.

However, their low long-term stability limits applic-
ability and poses an environmental problem due to the
release of chlorine from the catalyst. The bene®ts of
the stabilization of the Cl-containing catalysts are
evident and pass through the development of more
stable structures and a moderation of the reaction
conditions (temperature). Conway et al. evaluated
Li±MgO±Cl materials as a support for several oxides
[155] since these oxides have been reported to
decrease the operation temperature [156]. The Cl/Li
atomic ratio plays a key role, because Li stabilizes the
Cl additive. For Cl/Li atomic ratios above 11, chlorine
is lost until the ratio decreases to ca. 0.9±1. If the
initial Cl/Li atomic ratio is 0.9 little chlorine is lost on
stream. XPS measurements show that a LiCl layer is
formed on top of the MgO support [157] as predicted
by atomistic calculations [158]. The thin layer of Li2O
that appears to be formed on top of LiCl is expected to
be the active phase. The catalyst Cl±Li±MgO with a
Cl/L ratio of 0.9 is remarkably active, selective, and
stable at 893 K, maintaining 58% yield of ethylene
(75% conversion, 77% selectivity) over 50 h on stream
[157]. The presence of oxides of Sn, La, Nd, and Dy
results in a remarkable increase in conversion and at
the same time maintains good selectivity of ethylene.
The yield of ethylene is above 50%, although some
deactivation is still evident.
Ueda et al. [159] have recently reported the perfor-
mance of complex metal chloride oxides containing
bismuth, alkali, alkaline earth, chlorine and oxygen.
The presence of void volume in the reactor was
minimized to prevent gas-phase reaction interference
and blank tests showed no measurable activity. The
catalyst studied possesses a layered structure compris-
ing of SrBi3O4Cl units, and is very active although its
stability is low. Lead additive affords a very active
catalyst but deactivates readily (Table 5). The addition
of Sr promotes stability but conversion is lower.
Among the formulations tested, the catalytic perfor-
mance upon the addition of KCl and SrCl2 resulted in a
very active and stable KSr2Vi3O4Cl6 catalyst, with no
structural modi®cation measurable by XRD after 6 h
on stream. However, a moderate degradation of the
surface of the catalyst does appear to take place
because some HCl is detected at the outlet of the
catalyst. Li- and Na-promoted catalysts show very
similar
performance
but
structural
degradation,
although moderate, is observed in XRD experiments.
The use of other halogen additives is scarce, but
very
recently,
F-promoted
catalysts
have
been
reported by Luo and Wan to reach 94.5% selectivity
of ethylene at 23.4% conversion at 953 K on a LaF3-
promoted ceria catalyst [160]. However, the long term
stability of the catalyst must be evaluated. A remark-
able performance is presented by Au et al. [161] with a
BaBr2/Ho2O3 catalyst, which shows signi®cant deac-
tivation during the ®rst 4 h of operation (from 88%
selectivity of ethylene at 71% of conversion after 1 h
on stream to 64% selectivity of ethylene at 52%
conversion after 4 h on stream). Nevertheless, after
this initial deactivation, the yield of ethylene remains
essentially constant at 33% (64% ethylene selectivity
at 52% conversion) during atleast 48 h on stream.
2.8.
Non-reducible catalysts
The conversion of ethane on Li±doped magnesia is
a
heterogeneous±homogeneous
catalytic
process
[53,54,140,162,163] due to its ability to generate ethyl
radicals [53]. This strongly promotes selectivity since
the oxidation of ethylene on LiMgO catalysts is non-
selective [53,162]. As indicated by Burch and Crabb,
there are quite a few reports about ethane ODH on
non-reducible oxide catalysts; for example, LiNaMg

catalysts with an 86% selectivity of ethylene at a
conversion of 38% at 898 K [164] or a selectivity
of 46.3% at a conversion of 37.3% at 823 K on a Sn-
based catalyst [165].
Non-reducible oxides for ethane oxidation run
through a different mechanism than on reducible
oxides, because redox functionality is absent. A hetero-
geneous±homogeneous reaction scheme where the
oxide participates along with the homogeneous phase
appears to be present. Thus, the oxidation of ethane on
La2O3, Sm2O3, CeO2, and Pr6O11 points to a reactivity
order
per
surface
area
unit
like:
La2O3>
Sm2O3Pr6O11CeO2. The selectivity of ethylene
is one order of magnitude higher for the non-reducible
oxides La2O3 and Sm2O3. Redox functionality pro-
motes further non-selective oxidation [166]. For non-
reducible oxides, such as Sm2O3, oxidation must
occur on surface-activated oxygen species generated
from the chemisorption of molecular oxygen [167].
Alkali-promoted La2O3, Sm2O3 and MnO2 have fewer
sites for total oxidation, thus accounting for the higher
ethylene selectivity of the oxidative coupling of
methane, which is also expected to be bene®cial for
ethane oxydehydrogenation [149,168].
As commented above, the addition of Cl improves
both activity and selectivity (Table 6). The effect of
different additives on the LiMgO catalyst was reported
by Swaan at al. [81] who minimized the relevance of
homogeneous gas-phase reaction. La and Ce oxides
did not affect catalyst performance. The presence of
Co and P, and mainly Na increased selectivity, but the
catalyst was less active. Na minimized the formation
of CO. The addition of Nb or Cu sharply decreased
selectivity, with a lesser effect on activity while Co
and Sn increased activity at the expense of the selec-
tivity of ethylene [81].
2.9.
Other catalytic formulations
Many oxides of elements of the ®rst row of transi-
tion are active for total oxidation. However, some of
these elements have been tested for the selective
oxidation of ethane. Aika and coworkers have used
a CoO/MgO catalyst for ethane oxidation with N2O.
The activation of N2O is directly proportional to the
number of surface Co2 sites [64]. However, the
authors report a low selectivity for ethylene. IR spectra
after the reaction points to the existence of surface
carbonates, formate and acetate species, even when
no oxygenates are formed. The low selectivity of
these catalysts results from the much higher (ca. 7
times) reactivity of the catalyst with ethylene than
with ethane. Blaauw et al. [56] have also studied
cobalt supported on silica and on saponite. The
acid±base features of the support did not appear
to have any effect for ethane ODH. However, the
particle size of cobalt oxide is important, since Co
aggregates show lower activity per exposed Co site.
The interaction with the support, mainly in the layered
structure of saponite, did in¯uence selectivity, which
was higher than for larger aggregates of cobalt oxide
[56].

incorporates
Cr
in
its structure but some Cr sites may not be acces-
sible, since the conversion is moderate. The best
catalytic performance is achieved by CrPO4, with
30% conversion and 60% selectivity of ethylene.
Since the layered Zr±phosphate substrate has excess
P at the surface, it is likely that P-coordinates chromia
species be formed; these would account for the
decrease in total oxidation for the layered Cr-based
catalysts [169]. While crystalline chromia is a total
oxidation site, its interaction with P promotes selec-
tivity.
Chromium intercalated into ion-exchanged Na±
montmorillonites has also been used for selective
ethane oxidation by Olivera-Pastor et al. [170]. The
resulting materials are stable up to 900 K with high
surface coverage. For samples with moderate Cr
loading, activity is strongly in¯uenced by pretreat-
ment of the catalyst, as this strongly in¯uence the
acidic properties of the materials [170].
Chang et al. [59] have evaluated ethane oxydehy-
drogenation on ZSM-5 based catalysts (H, Na, Ni,
Pt, Ga, and V). Basic Na±ZSM-5 and neutral
[V]±ZSM-5 perform better than acid H±ZSM-5 for
the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Addition of
steam increases the selectivity to hydrocarbons since it
reduces cracking to methane, reaching selectivity of
ethylene of ca. 78% and conversion of ethane of ca.
43% at 823 K. No deactivation is observed up to 6 h on
stream. However, Ga- and Ni-containing zeolites cat-
alyze cracking and promote carbonaceous deposits,
which is not desirable for oxidative dehydrogenation.
However, they may be important for ethane aromati-
zation.
2.10.
New trends in selective ethane oxidation
The conversion of ethane to ethylene may become
highly selective as ethylene is much less reactive than
ethane with several catalysts. As the selective conver-
sion of ethane to oxygenates is seriously limited due to
the higher reactivity of C2-oxygenates [36], high
selectivities of C2-oxygenates are only accomplished
at low conversion levels. It is then necessary to look
for alternative activation means than would allow the
conversion of ethane in conditions which are not likely
to degrade the oxygenates formed. As in the case of
methane [171±173] the low-temperature conversion of
ethane
promotes
oxygenates
vs.
hydrocarbons
[33,123]. Thus the development of methods capable
of activating ethane at lower temperatures would not
only afford a lower tendency to degrade oxygenated
products, but also increase the production of oxyge-
nates to a larger extent. Several reports have been
presented in this line.
2.10.1.
Electrochemical activation of the oxidant
The electrochemical activation of oxygen on a Au/
YSZ/Ag (YSZ, yttria-stabilized zirconia) electroche-
mical membrane system developed by Hamakawa
et al. [174] shows that ethane oxidation is directly
proportional to the activation of oxygen and that all the
activated oxygen participates in the reaction. The use
of gold layers prevents the chemical activation of
oxygen, and permits an evaluation of the relevance
of oxygen pumping upon application of a voltage in
the cell. Acetaldehyde and CO2 are the oxidation
products under electrochemical conditions whereas
COx and ethylene are formed under conventional
conditions. This highlights the relevance of surface
activated oxygen species and reaction temperature.
The surface oxygen species is expected to be Oÿ, but
no evidence has been reported in this sense [174].
The ability of YSZ to pump reactive oxygen
through oxygen anion conduction has lead Otsuka
et al. [175] to use it as a support for boria. Otsuka's
work evaluates the catalytic performance of boria
supported on YSZ [175]. Boria has proved to be active
and selective for ODH on different supports [116,139].
B2O3/YSZ is active for ethane oxidation in an open
circuit at 948 K. In a closed circuit, activated oxygen,
which originates from the migration of oxide ions, is
generated and activity increases with voltage, by a

factor of up to ca. 1.7 at 6 V. The active site appears to
be associated with the boria±YSZ interface, and sur-
face peroxide species have been proposed to be the
active sites as determined by XPS. However, the
binding energies reported are somewhat high [175].
2.10.2.
Photocatalytic activation
Photocatalytic ethane oxidation has also been pro-
posed as a very promising method to circumvent the
low selectivity of thermal oxidation of alkanes with
oxygen. The electrochemical method discussed above
produces signi®cant amounts of COx [116,174,175].
Partial oxidation of alkanes by UV-light is also
affected by low selectivity due to the high energy
of the photons [176±178]. The low selectivity in
oxidation with O2 is due to the very energetic condi-
tions required to activate the reactants. UV-light
assisted conversion activates oxygen through electron
transfer for the alkane forming Oÿ
2 and an alkyl cation,
which readily releases a proton to form OOH radicals.
Subsequent formation of the alkyl hydroperoxide may
be followed by homolytic cleavage into highly reac-
tive OH and alkoxy radicals, which further promote
the non-selective degradation of partial oxidation
products. However, photocatalytic oxidation at mod-
erate temperatures, or even at room temperatures, is
rather selective [179±181]. The photocatalytic oxida-
tion of alkanes on oxides depends on the length of the
hydrocarbon chain, as reported by Djeghri et al. [176].
The photoactivation of C2 to C8 hydrocarbons takes
place on titania. Oxygenates are formed, but CO2 is
the dominant product. As in the case of thermal
catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation, reactivity is affected
by the type of carbon and decreases as follows:
Ctert>Cquart>Csec>Cprim [176]. Some catalysts have
recently been reported for the selective photooxidation
of ethane to acetaldehyde. Wada et al. evaluated
supported molybdena catalysts for ethane photooxi-
dation [181,182]. ZnO±supported molybdena shows
no measurable activity at 548 K without UV irradia-
tion. MoO3/ZnO is selective to acetaldehyde under
UV irradiation at 493 K, but conversion is low (<1%)
[182]. Formaldehyde and CO2 are also formed to a
signi®cant extent. The ZnO support is more active and
selective to acetaldehyde (selectivity 68%) but CO2
formation is still considerable (24%). The situation is
different for silica±supported molybdena catalysts
[181]. No thermal activity is observed at 483 K.
Conversion is still low under irradiation at 493 K,
but acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are the main
oxidation products, and minor amounts of CO2 and
ethanol are also formed [181]. Total activity increases
with the temperature of the catalyst bed, but above
470 K acetaldehyde formation decreases and formal-
dehyde production increases. This suggests that for-
maldehyde might originate from further degradation
of acetaldehyde, as in the conventional oxidation of
ethane.
Recently, Frei and coworkers have used CaY and
BaY zeolites to render complete selective photoox-
idation of ethane to acetaldehyde with O2 under
visible light [179,183,184]. Under their conditions,
no COx byproducts were observed, acetaldehyde being
the only oxidation product along with water. Under
irradiation alkane radical cations are formed, as
demonstrated spectroscopically, and tend to deproto-
nate to form alkyl radicals [185]. Under moderate
reaction conditions, the alkyl hydroperoxide radical
formed readily dehydrates in the zeolite environment,
thus producing carbonyl products with no side reac-
tion. The use of low energy photons and low tem-
perature precludes homolysis of peroxide bonds, into
very reactive alkoxy and hydroxy radicals, which
would promote the non-selective attack to the partial
oxidation products [180]. Pore sizes on the nm scale
impose diffusional restriction on reaction intermedi-
ates, which is essential for high selectivity. In situ IR
spectra show that acetaldehyde and water are the only
products formed, even at the highest conversion (20%)
[179]. This result clearly breaks the reported limiting
yield of acetaldehyde under conventional reaction
conditions. IR studies suggest that initially the inter-
mediate ethylhydroperoxide species is formed. CaY
zeolite affords a higher photochemical yield due to the
higher electrostatic ®eld inside the CaY cage, which
increases the stabilization of the ethane O2 charge
transfer state [179].The electrostatic effect accounts
for the activity order, which decreases thus: CaY>
BaYNaY (NaY is inactive). The participation of
acid sites in CaY zeolites cannot be excluded. How-
ever, the high electrostatic ®eld in the supercage of
Ca±exchange Y zeolite has also been measured by
EPR [186,187] and determined by model calculation
[188]. The physical con®nement imposed by the
zeolite cage also prevents random radical reactions
and the homolytic fragmentation of primary products,
338

hence increasing the selectivity. The oxidation by O2
with Vis-light is extremely selective, and these sys-
tems have also been successfully applied to the oxida-
tion of ole®ns, alkyls substituted benzenes, and other
alkanes by O2 in zeolites under Vis-light [179,183].
This latter group has just made a very stimulating
review on complete selective oxidation reactions by
O2 under Vis-light in zeolites [180].
2.10.3.
Activation by ozone
Ozone is a convenient radical initiator at mode-
rate
reaction
temperatures.
It
decomposes
into
molecular oxygen and atomic oxygen. The latter is
extremely reactive and reacts with alkanes to form
alkyl radicals, thus initiating a radical reaction
mechanism. Gesser et al. have reported the con-
version of ethane to C1- and C2-oxygenates in the
gas-phase with combined formaldehyde±methanol±
acetaldehyde±ethanol selectivity between 36.7% and
95.7% at an ethane conversion equal or lower than
6.1% [189]. Li and Oyama have reported similar
results for the selective gas-phase methane oxidation
to formaldehyde using ozone as a radical initiator
[190]. When a catalyst is present (Mg or Li/MgO),
the reactivity is further improved [190]. The MgO
catalyst is active for non-selective CO and CO2 for-
mation, whereas the Li/MgO catalyst promotes the
production of formaldehyde. Consequently, the com-
bined use of ozone and an appropriate catalyst is
expected to signi®cantly improve the production of
oxygenates from ethane.
2.10.4.
Activation by acids
Fe and Mn, supported on sulfated zirconia (SZ),
have been used for the activation of ethane. These
catalysts convert ethane to ethylene along with
methane and butane at 573±673 K. Other acids, such
as SZ, H±ZSM-5, or USY zeolite show no activity at
all at this temperature. At a higher temperature
(723 K), these solid acids also activate ethane. The
initial selectivity of ethylene at 0.1% conversion is
close to 98%, 94%, 97%, and 99% for SZ, FeMn/SZ,
H±ZSM-5,
and
USY
zeolite,
respectively.
The
observed mechanism is analogous to that seen in
superacid solutions [191,192]. The FeMn/SZ catalyst
has the highest acidity in the series [193,194] since it
runs at lower temperature than conventional solid
catalysts.
2.10.5.
Monolithic reactors
The use of monolithic catalysts for the production
of ethylene or syngas from ethane has been reported
by Schmidt and coworkers [195±197] for supported
noble metal. The application of supported oxide
should be a highly attractive option because of the
high space velocities that can be reached.
2.10.6.
Membrane reactors
A certain increase in the yield of ethylene has been
achieved with membrane reactors. A membrane reac-
tor alters the thermodynamic equilibrium of chemical
reactions. Oxygen can be permeated through the
membrane that would provide stoichiometric hydro-
carbon-to-oxygen levels along the membrane. This
con®guration prevents high local oxygen concentra-
tion [198,199]. Alumina-based membrane reactors
have
been
used
to
support
Li/MgO
catalysts
[198,199] and SmO/MgO catalysts [199] as active
phases for selective ethane ODH. Membrane reactors
show better performance than conventional ones in
both yield and selectivity at low feed ratios. This
difference decreases as feed ratios increase [198].
At low ethane-to-oxygen ratios, the ethylene yield
is close to 50% [198]. Mixed membrane reactors,
equivalent to a membrane reactor followed by a con-
ventional ®xed bed reactor, yield 57% ethylene [199].
3.
Aromatization of ethane
The production of BTX (benzene, toluene and
xylene) hydrocarbons from LPG should signi®cantly
reduce the cost of these hydrocarbons, which are
mainly produced by the reforming of naphthas. The
feedstock of naphthas accounts for ca. 80% of the
production cost of BTX [200] and references therein.
The conversion of paraf®ns to aromatics has essen-
tially been achieved from propane and larger hydro-
carbons [200±203]. For instance, n-butane is 100
times more reactive than ethane [204]. Methane and
ethane are harder to convert to BTX hydrocarbons
[201]. Actually, methane is formed as a byproduct of
the cracking of hydrocarbons and does no undergo
secondary transformations under aromatization reac-
tion conditions [203±205]. The presence of strong acid
sites promotes the formation of methane [206].
Despite the considerable interest in the aromatization
M.A. Ban
Äares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319±348
339
of ethane since the original patent by Chu [207], only
few papers addressing this have appeared in the
literature in the last 10 years. Alkanes appear to be
activated as in superacid solutions [191] but at higher
temperatures, through protolysis of their C±H or C±C
bonds, which ®nally result in ole®ns. These undergo
further
transformation,
such
as
oligomerization,
cracking, cyclization of oligomers, and aromatization.
The yields of the products vs. contact time show that
ethylene is the main product at low residence times.
The conversion of alkanes to aromatics takes advan-
tage of the molecular con®nement provided by the
structure of zeolites, which affects product distribu-
tion. However, deactivation by coking is important
and certain characteristics should also be present in the
zeolite. Most research has therefore been carried out
on ZSM-5 zeolite, which has an intermediate pore and
channel size [208], which limits the formation of large
polynuclear aromatics, that lead to coke formation.
These zeolites present high acidity [204] but the acid
sites are separated. This is an important condition
since close
acid
sites promote coke
formation
[201,209]. The use of metals has a promoting effect,
which is affected by its dispersion and the use of other
additives [200,208,210±215]. However, catalysis by
metals is out of the scope of this review. The use of Zn
or
Ga
slows
down
the
deactivation
by
coke
[3,151,217]. Aromatization is promoted by Zn and
Ga [145,211,215±217]. The presence of Zn or Ga in
modi®ed H±ZSM-5 zeolites increases ethane conver-
sion from 2% on H±ZSM-5 to 52% on Zn±H±ZSM-5.
Ga has intermediate activity [203]. However, under
reducing conditions (such those imposed by aromati-
zation), Zn can be eluted from the zeolite, while Ga
undergoes a much less intense elution due to its much
higher boiling point [201,218]. In fact, Ga increases
stability on stream beyond 15 h [3], because it is
highly stable under redox cycles [201]. The presence
of Ga or Zn species increases the initial formation of
ole®ns, which appears to be the rate-determining-step
[204]. A bifunctional mechanism appears to take place
on Ga-containing zeolites: (1) dehydrogenation in the
Ga sites, and (2) oligomerization and dehydrociclyza-
tion in the protonic sites [208]. Acid zeolites, such as
H±ZSM-5, convert light alkanes into aromatics. How-
ever, the aromatization also yields light alkanes, since
it occurs accompanied by cracking, thus limiting yield
[203,215,219]. Oligomerization appears to take place
on acidic sites; these alkenes must subsequently be
dehydrogenated to aromatics. Evidence has been pre-
sented that both Zn and acidic sites must be present
[203,215]
Recent work by Bandeira and Taa
Ãrit provides
kinetic evidence that the initial dehydrogenation of
ethane and subsequent oligomerization and dehydro-
cyclization are associated with the same active site.
Thus, the reactants and intermediates compete for the
same site [220]. A similar conclusion has been reached
by Haagen et al. in transient studies on H±ZSM-5 and
Zn±H±ZSM-5 [221]. Ethane pulses at 773 K forms
ethylene on H±ZSM-5. A continuous feed of ethylene,
the primary product, yields alkyl aromatics on
H±ZSM-5 and benzene on Zn±H±ZSM-5. It therefore
appears that Zn species are not only essential in the
activation of the ethane molecule but also in subse-
quent reactions to aromatics [221]. Thus, reactants and
intermediates could compete for the Zn site. It is
interesting to note that the relevance of acid sites
under pulse conditions is not signi®cant, since the
experiments afford comparable results for Zn±H±
ZSM-5 and Zn±Na±ZSM-5. However, at longer reac-
tion times, Brùnsted sites must participate, as sug-
gested
by
the
formation
of
isobutene,
and
subsequently, alkyl aromatics. However, the Al con-
tent does not linearly correlate with activity [3],
suggesting that it is not only acidity that promotes
activity.
Schultz and Baerns have observed that ethane is
dehydrogenated on both Ga2O3 outside the surface of
zeolites and on their acid sites [3], in agreement with
IR studies by Yakerson et al. [222]. The BTX yield
increases linearly with Ga contents up to 3 wt% and
then levels off. However, the need for exchanged Ga
cations in the zeolite lattice has been observed by
several authors and their presence is associated with
better aromatization performance [223±227]. The
lower
reactivity
of
a
physical
mixture
of
Ga2O3H±ZSM-5 vs. impregnated or ion exchanged
Ga2O3/H±ZSM-5 highlights the relevance of Ga dis-
persion in the zeolite (Fig. 4). However, it has been
reported that the dehydrogenation activity of the
framework Ga atoms is lower than that of the extra-
framework gallium species [200,228,229]. Several
results reviewed by Seddon [201] and Guisnet et al.
[200] support the relevance of non-framework Ga
species strongly interacting with zeolite. In fact, the
340
M.A. Ban
Äares / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 319±348
dispersion of Ga appears to account for the activation
of the catalyst on stream [225,230] since the H2
released may promote the reduction and dispersion
of the Ga species. Dispersed Ga species close to acid
sites appear to be critical for catalyst performance.
However, they may be not integrated in the frame-
work, but rather highly dispersed in the pore structure.
The formation of a highly dispersed reduced Ga
species has been observed with K-edge X-ray absorp-
tion spectroscopy during on stream operation and with
71Ga-MAS-NMR by Meitzner et al. [231]. The spe-
cies, probably GaHx, appears to be formed during the
reaction. This is an example of the relevance of in situ
characterization under reaction conditions. The use of
other H acceptors like Zr2Fe results in a 5-fold higher
yield of aromatics on Zn±, Ga± and Pt±CVM pentasils
(similar to H±ZSM-5) [232].
The relevance of redox and acid sites for ethane
oxidative dehydrogenation on other microporous
materials (APO-5) has been proposed by Con-
cepcio
Ân et al. [109]. Despite their lower stability,
Mo and W have also been used on H±ZSM-5 zeolites
(Si/Al 50) for the conversion of ethane. Mo/H±ZSM-5
is more active than W/H±ZSM-5. The formation of
Mo2C is proposed to afford for the good performance
of molybdena-based catalysts [233]. The cracking to
methane is signi®cant for all catalysts, but production
of BTX is also important. W/H±ZSM-5 is highly
selective but less active. The binary MoW/H±ZSM-
5 catalyst is reported to show better activity and
stability than single Mo- or W-supported catalysts
[234].
4.
Total oxidation of ethane
The total oxidation of ethane has been studied to a
much lesser extent than the former reactions. Kinetic
isotopic or in situ IR studies have demonstrated that
the total and partial oxidation of ethane is initiated by
the C±H bond cleavage of the weakest C±H bond in
the molecule. The next step is the formation of surface
oxygen-containing intermediates on an oxide catalyst.
The reactivity of the catalyst and the stability of the
intermediates will determine the selectivity pro®le.
Precious metals have been used for the combustion of
ethane more often than oxides [235±238]. However,
the use of supported metal oxides is mainly focused on
Cr and Cu. The activity of Cr oxide was reported by Yu
Yao on Cr2O3 microcrystals [239]. Kinetic isotopic
effect [239] and IR [240] indicate that the initial
activation of the C±H bond is involved in the rate-
controlling step for the oxidation of ethane, but not for
ethylene. Ethylene appears to adsorb through the
double bond, whose attack should be the rate-deter-
mining step [239,240]. The use of chromium oxide on
titania, produces mainly CO2 (ca. 96%) and little
amount of ethylene [241]. Activity increases with
chromia loading on titania, while selectivity values
remain unaltered (Table 7). Apparently, titania sup-
port only serves to increase the exposure of chromia.
In situ studies of the total oxidation of ethane on
MgCr2O4 by IR spectroscopy point to the formation of
surface acetate species at 423 K. A weak band at
1385 cmÿ1 and a shoulder near 1580 cmÿ1 reveal
the formation of traces of formate ions [242], pointing
to profound oxidation. Other bands suggest the exis-
tence of dioxy-ethylydene species and surface acet-
aldehyde [242]. The latter species disappear upon
further heating. Acetate species burn in the 573±
773 K temperature range to produce CO2 and water.
The combustion of ethane appears to run via surface

acetate species and acetaldehyde appears to be an
earlier intermediate. In contrast with large hydrocar-
bons, no evidence of surface alkoxy species from
ethane was observed by Finocchio et al., although
the high temperature required to activate ethane may
account for its ready oxidation to carbonyl groups
[242]. It appears that the breaking of the weaker C±H
bond is followed by the formation of a C±O bond. The
results suggest that the observed acetate species are
the ®nal intermediates. Also, selective and non-selec-
tive oxidation reactions appear to be consecutive, as
supported by the formation of partial oxidation pro-
ducts on the surface of combustion catalysts. The
formation of these surface species has been observed
in the absence of gas-phase oxidant, which aims to
conclude that the total oxidation of oxides is not only
consecutive to partial oxidation, but also that nucleo-
philic oxygen species (lattice oxygen) are also
involved in total oxidation, if its binding energy is
low enough. The selectivity-determining step pro-
posed by Kung and coworkers [42,43] should be
the relative rate of desorption of the partial oxidation
products as compared to the reactivity of the oxygen
species. Lee et al. have reported the relevance of
lattice oxygen for total oxidation on a perovskite
catalyst (LaMnOx) using alternating pulses of ethane
and oxygen [243]. These authors also show that sur-
face hydrocarbon species remain on the surface for
several minutes at 648 K between oxygen pulses.
The relevance of electrophilic oxygen proposed by
Bielanski and Haber [244] does not contradict the
former results, which highlight the relevance of
nucleophilic oxygen for total oxidation, but provide
no evidence to rule out the role of electrophilic oxygen
species for combustion. It therefore appears that elec-
trophilic oxygen species are associated with non-
selective oxidation while nucleophilic oxygen species
may be associated with selective and non-selective
oxidation reaction. A transient kinetic study by Papa-
georgiou et al. on the reactivity of lattice (in the
absence of gaseous oxygen) and adsorbed oxygen
(in the presence of gaseous oxygen) species in the
oxidation of ethane and ethylene, shows that both
oxygen species are active for total oxidation on a
Li/TiO2 catalyst [245]. Lattice oxygen is a total
oxidation site for ethane and ethene, reactivity being
higher for the paraf®n than for the ole®n. Conversely,
the reactivity trend is reversed for surface oxygen
species. The relative activities of lattice and surface
oxygen are affected by the loading of Li cation [245].
Cu-based catalysts are also used for ethane combus-
tion. Kucherov and coworkers have reported that the
complete oxidation of ethane on Cu±H±ZSM-5 cata-
lyst correlates with the number of coordinately unsa-
turated square-planar cupric cations stabilized in
ZSM-5 channels [246]. Only CO2 and water are the
oxidation products. However, the square planar Cu2
species tend to irreversibly rearrange into isolated
mono-cationic species by steam treatment at 903 K
over 17 h, as observed with in situ EPR by Kucherov
et al. [247]. These Cu species are exposed to the gas-
phase molecules, but their activity decreases remark-
ably. The addition of La, or Ce appears to stabilize
active square planar Cu2 species [247]. Doping by

(Fig. 5)
[247,248]. The use of rare earth additives provides
a signi®cant stabilization to Cu±H±ZSM-5 based cat-
alysts for ethane combustion. Co±H±ZSM-5 has an
activity slightly lower than Cu±H±ZSM-5, but both
catalysts deactivate under high temperature treatment.
The Cu±Co±H±ZSM-5 catalyst is not only less sensi-
tive to high temperature treatment, but also three times
more active than monocationic catalysts (Fig. 5)
[248]. The remarkable effect of cobalt requires that
it must be in intimate interaction with Cu to improve
its speci®c activity or the number or active sites. This
interaction must also account for the high thermal
stability of the bicationic catalyst. The support has no
activity for the oxidation of ethane. However, if oxy-
gen is replaced by N2O the activity of the zeolite and
Cu±H±ZSM-5 are comparable [249], but coke forma-
tion is signi®cant near 673 K. The ability of Cu species
to decompose N2O decreases upon treatment at 723 K,
but the oxidation of ethane remains unaffected [249].
The use of N2O instead of O2 changes the nature of the
reaction mechanism, since it has a heterogeneous±
homogeneous nature [249].

Conclusions
The results presented above show that the conver-
sion of ethane is a new challenge in catalytic oxida-
tion, which in the case of certain products can be run at
reasonable yields. The dehydrogenation of ethane
affords good selectivity. For this reaction the nature
of the support oxide has a remarkable effect on the
activity and selectivity of the supported metal oxide.
Its relevance is related to modi®cation of the Metal±
O±support bond, which appears to be the most critical
one for activity under oxidation conditions, since
activity is altered near one order of magnitude. Redox
and acid±base properties are strongly affected by the
support. Whereas activity depends on the reducibility
of the supported oxide, this does not appear to corre-
late with its oxidation state under reaction conditions.
The presence of additives has a strong effect on
activity; by contrast, the effect of surface coverage
below monolayer loading values is only moderate.
Structural knowledge about the effect of additives on
supported oxides is still poor as regards the catalytic
implications of structural, redox and acid±base modi-
®cations and further research must be done to under-
stand the role of the additives. On the other hand, the
conversion of ethane to C2-oxygenates affords sig-
ni®cantly lower yields under conventional catalyst
formulation and reaction conditions. Since the pro-
duction of C2-oxygenates from ethane, mainly acetic
acid, is a very attractive reaction for the industry it is
necessary to develop new catalytic concepts that will
allow the production of oxygenates with high yield,
like new catalysts formulations, the use of different
oxidants (nitrous oxide) or the application of alter-
native activation (electrochemical activation, photo-
activation, reductant activation or radical initiators).
Any advance in decreasing the reaction temperature
will favor the selectivity and the formation of oxyge-
nates. The use of radical initiators has afforded very
attractive results for methane conversion, and could be
of great use for ethane conversion. The use of chlor-
ine-precursors in the gas-phase appears to result in a
new Cl-containing surface catalyst structure, rather
than affecting gas-phase reactivity, and yields higher
conversions with comparable selectivity values; how-
ever, the stability on stream is low. While some results
presented above indicate signi®cant improvements in
the stability of the halogen-containing catalysts, more
effort should be directed to developing stable phases.
The aromatization of ethane displays a different
dependence on the support since it should present
acidic sites and must prevent coke formation. The
structure of the sites under aromatization reactions is
signi®cantly modi®ed by reducing conditions. Gas-
phase reactions may also play an important role,
mainly at high temperature, when the ODH reaction
is promoted. Chlorine-containing catalysts afford very
high yields for ethane ODH, but in most cases stability
is low. In situ characterization techniques should
provide knowledge at molecular level about the cat-
alytic site under oxidative and aromatization condi-
tions, thus enabling the design of more ef®cient
catalysts. Accordingly, it is foreseen that much future
research will focus on molecular understanding of the
catalyst during reaction. The nature of the oxidant
determines catalytic performance since its interaction
with the active site is determined by different para-
meters, molecular oxygen being more sensitive to
redox properties, whereas nitrous oxide is subject to
different requirements. The use of new technologies
provides alternative means to promote activation of

ethane or the oxidant that will not lead to further
degradation of partial oxidation products. Some of
these new techniques have already afforded very
promising results.
The need to control the reaction calls for control of
the catalyst and of the catalytic systems. It is important
to stress the relevance of molecular knowledge of the
active site and its modi®cations under the reaction
conditions. The emergence of new concepts to yield
more ef®cient and selective activation includes the
development of new catalysts and the use of alter-
native means to activate the hydrocarbon in such a way
that the degradation of the desired product will be
prevented. There are indeed many opportunities for
development in ethane conversion that should afford a
better production of ole®ns, oxygenates and aro-
matics.
