Addition of a very small amount of 3d transition metal ions, particularly Fe3+, can appreciably enhance the catalytic 
activity of silica in the formation of formaldehyde in 
the partial oxidation of methane by oxygen. 
The direct conversion of natural gas into chemical feedstocks 
or liquid fuels is currently attracting much interest. Partial 
oxidation of methane into formaldehyde or methanol is one o
f
 
the most challenging subjects in catalysis research.1.2 
Research efforts have focused on silica-based catalysts,= 
because they can bring about selective formaldehyde forma- 
tion in the oxidation of methane by oxygen, provided methane 
conversion is kept low. 
It is becoming apparent that a high formaldehyde yield is 
obtained if the deposited quantity of M0033.8 or V2056 is 
limited to less than monolayer coverage of the silica surface. 
In the case o
f
 silica activated by adding Sn02 
or Zr02,9 
a small 
amount of deposition is also necessary for the selective 
oxidation of methane. One plausible explanation for this is 
that these promoters provide redox centres on the silica 
surface.3.6 Such a redox centre can enhance the catalytic 
activity of the bare silica through activation of oxygen from the 
gas phase.7 
Even unloaded silica itself can catalyse the partial oxidation 
of methane to produce formaldehyde.3+14 Formation of C2 
compounds or methanol is observed if radical reactions in the 
gas phase are concomitant.9~11~13 
The activity of silica catalysts 
for formaldehyde formation depends strongly on their origin 
and history, and the most active one has been reported to be 
superior even to the Moo3-loaded silica.7-14 The reasons for 
the great differences in activity among silica catalysts are still 
not clear; however, it has been suggested that they may be 
due to differences in the surface area," the amount of 
contaminating sodium12 and the number of defect sites.12J3 
It is probable that some other minor contaminants bring 
about the observed differences in activity among silica 
catalysts. The role of various additives is also interesting for 
the study of new catalytic promoters. We report here how the 
addition of 3d transition metal ions can increase the catalytic 
activity of silica in the direct partial oxidation of methane by 
oxygen. As these metal ions are expected to be very active for 
redox reactions, they were added in much smaller quantities 
than are usually used for the promotion o
f
 silica catalysts.3.698 
A pure silica [Catalysis Society of Japan (JRC-SIO-4; 
specific surface area 347 m* g-l; impurity Na < 1.5 ppm, 
A1203 
< 
6.6 ppm, CaO < 
0.3 ppm)] was used in this study and 
impregnated with aqueous solutions of nitrates of Mn", FeIII, 
CoII, Ni", Cu", Zn", or NH4V03. The quantity of the metal 
ions added in each case was 0.05 atom % (metal ion : 
Si = 
5 : 
10 
OOO). The precursors of the catalysts were dried at 100 "C 
and calcined at 650 "C in air for 1 
h. Prior to use, the catalysts 
in a reactor were heat-treated again at 650 "C in air for 20 min. 
A 0.05 g sample of each catalyst was loaded into a quartz 
tube reactor (inner diameter 6 mm) and quartz wool was used 
to hold the catalyst in place. A mixture of methane and oxygen 
(CH4 
: 
0 2  
= 
95 : 
5) at ambient pressure was passed through the 
reactor at a flow rate of 100 cm3 min-l. Effluent from the 
reactor was analysed by FTIR (Model 205, Nicolet) with a gas 
analytical cell (optical length 130 mm). A gas chromatograph 
with a thermal conductivity detector (Model G-2800, Yanaco) 
was also used for the analysis of the products which were 
separated by use of a Porapak T column and an activated 
carbon column. The oxygenates of methane, and carbon 
oxides at levels as low as 50 ppm can be detected by this 
analytical system. Neither homogeneous gas phase reactions15 
nor the reaction catalysed by the quartz wool in the present 
reactor were detected up to 650 "C. 
Fig. 1 
shows the products of the methane oxidation over 
various promoted silica catalysts at 600 
"C. Unpromoted silica 
itself shows a certain activity for formaldehyde forma- 
tion.3.10-14 Addition of small amounts of metal ions can 
enhance the catalytic activity for the formaldehyde formation 
as well as the formation of carbon oxides. The effect is most 
pronounced for Fe-promoted silica, which shows a tenfold 
increase in yield of formaldehyde compared with that 
observed for the simple silica catalyst. The space-time yield 
(STY) 
of formaldehyde was calculated to be 292 g kg-lcat h-1. 
This value is almost identical to that observed at 600 
"C for the 
V205-promoted 
silica,14J6 which is one of the best catalysts 
for this reaction reported so far. 
From Fig. 1, 
one can notice a trade-off relationship between 
formaldehyde selectivity and conversion of methane. Such a 
dependence is often observed for promoted silica catalysts.3-5 
The relatively small effect of vanadium observed in this study 
is not surprising, but coincides well with the results reported 
previously6~7 
in that less than 1% m/m loading of V205 
on 
silica is not effective for enhancement of formaldehyde 
formation. 
Simple oxides of 3d transition metals have been well known 
as active catalysts for complete methane oxidation. 1
7
 Indeed, 
under the present reaction conditions, a precipitated a-Fe203 
catalyst produces COz with 100% selectivity (C02 yield: 
0.06% v/v at 400 "C, 0.21% v/v at 450 "C). When the amount 
of deposited Fe, Co or Cr on silica catalysts becomes as much 
as 2% m/m, the selectivity for carbon oxides reportedly 
exceeds 99% for methane oxidation by N20.6,1*

indicate that the deposited Fe in the present catalyst may not 
exist as a simple 
oxide form but as atomically dispersed ions on 
silica. The number of deposited metal ions corresponds 
roughly to only 0.14% of the surface Si atoms (ca. 1015 cm-2) 
of the catalyst, if the number of surface atoms is estimated by 
use of the specific gravity of quartz. 
For comparison, Ti02, A1203 and ZrOz supporting 0.05 
atom % of Fe were prepared. However, no enhancement of 
formaldehyde formation in methane oxidation was observed 
on these catalysts. This result strongly suggests that the 
observed 
high formaldehyde 
yield on the Fe-promoted silica is 
a consequence of a synergistic interaction between silica and 
the highly dispersed Fe ions on it. As Fe is believed to provide 
a very active redox centre, even a very small amount of Fe 
seems to be enough for the oxygen activation on silica.336,7
