Abstract
The use of the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method for the generation of multicomponent oxide materials is reviewed with
emphasis on the generation of catalysts and catalyst support materials. Various adaptations of the TMP method that allow manipulation
of catalyst compositions are presented. Further, the generation of isolated catalytic centers via grafting techniques is summarized. The
implications for syntheses of new catalysts and catalyst formulations are discussed, and speciﬁc examples that involve selective hydrocarbon
oxidation catalysts are provided.

1. Introduction
New analytical methods, high-level theoretical studies,
and various mechanistic experiments are producing im-
portant information regarding factors that contribute to a
catalyst’s activity, selectivity, and stability [1–6]. The results
from these studies are potentially quite valuable in lead-
ing us to new generations of catalysts, since they provide
structure–reactivity correlations that can be used in cata-
lyst design. Future advances in catalysis research will also
be driven by the development of new synthetic methodolo-
gies, which allow the efﬁcient and reliable construction of
complex inorganic structures. These synthetic methods will
provide access to catalytic materials that are currently un-
known and to well-deﬁned structures that can be used to
test theories concerning the inﬂuence of structure on re-
activity. Catalyst development clearly relies on synergistic
relationships among research activities on several fronts, but
advances in synthesis have lagged somewhat behind those
occurring in characterization, theory, and mechanistic analy-
sis. This situation contrasts with that in the ﬁeld of electronic
materials, where the development of new synthetic tech-

niques has played a vital role in producing materials with
improved properties [7–9].
Many synthetic challenges are presented by established
structure–reactivity relationships and by well-recognized
goals in catalysis research. This is particularly true for
heterogeneous catalysts, since synthetic control over the
structures of complex solids is still rather limited. One as-
pect of the challenge of synthesizing catalytic materials is
that very often, structures for the most active and selec-
tive heterogeneous catalysts are metastable. This requires
the use of low-temperature methods and often rather in-
volved synthetic procedures [10–13]. In general, more prac-
tical synthetic methods are needed to achieve controlled,
facile assembly of complex nanostructures [14–20]. The
importance of nanostructural control is emphasized by the
many nanoscaled structures that appear to markedly inﬂu-
ence catalytic properties. These include supported mono-
layers, highly dispersed catalytic particles, catalyst–support
interfaces, and framework mesoporosity [21,22]. Recent
progress in the development of synthetic methods for creat-
ing nanostructures has been driven largely by the search for
new electronic materials. Of relevance to catalysis, meso-
porous materials have become available with the discovery
of the surfactant-mediated growth of inorganic networks
[22–26]. Other methods involving templating and formation
of organic–inorganic interfaces have produced well-deﬁned
nanoparticles and nanowires [21,27–30].

There is still a need for simple and versatile synthetic
methods that allow manipulation of structure on an even
smaller scale (atomic level), since for many of the best cat-
alysts the spatial arrangement of metal atoms on a catalyst
surface is crucial for deﬁning reactivity. For example, the
M–O–M′ heterolinkages of bimetallic oxides and catalyst–
support interfaces are associated with reactivities that are
not observed for the corresponding homolinkages M–O–M
and M′–O–M′. This has led to considerable effort geared
toward the production of well-dispersed (atomically homo-
geneous) mixed-element oxides. For the most part, these
efforts have involved modiﬁcations of the sol–gel synthe-
sis of oxides [10–12,31]; however, this approach is limited
by the inherently different rates of hydrolysis for alkox-
ide precursors (e.g., M(OR)n and M′(OR′)m). For many
catalysts, desirable properties appear to be associated with
well-deﬁned active sites containing one or perhaps a few
metal centers (single sites) [32–37]. Thus, it is important to
develop methods to achieve the controlled chemical modiﬁ-
cation of surfaces via the introduction of well-deﬁned active
sites. Most attempts to introduce inorganic structures of this
type have centered on aqueous impregnation methods, which
suffer from the tendency of many metal-based species to ag-
glomerate on the surface of a support during dehydration.
A very promising strategy for the production of well-deﬁned
and highly active sites on the surface of an oxide sup-
port involves grafting of an organometallic species, followed
by activation of the resulting “site” via further chemical
reactions [38,39]. This approach includes what may be de-
scribed as “surface organometallic chemistry,” which has
been used by Basset and co-workers to prepare highly active
catalysts for alkane metathesis and alkane hydrogenolysis
[40–45].
Our research program in the synthesis of heterogeneous
catalysts focuses on strategies that employ molecular de-
sign and molecular precursor chemistry. Much of this work
has targeted the production of multicomponent oxides for
which high dispersions of elements are expected to give
desirable catalytic properties. For example, some materials
of this type function as solid acids (e.g., ZrO2–SiO2 and
Al2O3–SiO2) [46–51]. In addition, a wide variety of com-
plex metal oxides have been identiﬁed as selective partial
oxidation catalysts [52–54]. For multicomponent catalysts
of this kind, optimum performance should result from maxi-
mization of surface area, homogeneity, and active site distri-
bution.
In synthesizing a variety of multicomponent oxide ma-
terials with tailored properties, we have employed a molec-
ular building-block approach referred to as the thermolytic
molecular precursor (TMP) method [55–83]. This mole-
cular precursor approach employs metal complexes con-
taining oxygen-rich ligands, such as those with the gen-
eral formulas LnM[OSi(O tBu)3]m
[55–73,76–79] and
LnM[O2P(O tBu)2]m [79–83], where Ln = alkoxide, amide,
alkyl, etc. Such compounds function as excellent single-
source precursors to carbon-free, homogeneous mixed-ele-
ment oxide materials of the types M/Si/O and M/P/O,
respectively. The low-temperature (< 473 K) thermolytic
conversion of these molecular species to three-dimensional
networks occurs via elimination of isobutene and H2O (af-
ter condensation of the resulting hydroxyl groups). When
the thermolyses are performed in nonpolar solvents (e.g.,
toluene or n-octane), a solvent-containing gel is often ob-
tained. The conventional air-drying of this gel provides
a xerogel, and supercritical drying methods produce an aero-
gel. These drying methods provide materials with similar,
very high surface areas and pore volumes.
Although the sol–gel process and the TMP method both
represent low-temperature routes to metastable materials,
the TMP method offers several advantages. First, the use
of high-purity and well-deﬁned species allows accurate
control over the stoichiometry of the ﬁnal material. Also, the
preexistence of M–O–E groups in the molecular precursor
maximizes the homogeneity of the ﬁnal material and leads
to a large number of such heterolinkages. The TMP method
also offers beneﬁts with respect to surface properties, since
the use of nonpolar solvents minimizes pore collapse upon
drying, thus providing high pore volumes and surface areas.
Additionally, the use of nonaqueous media prevents M–O–E
cleavage via hydrolytic means, a common occurrence in
sol–gel processes that leads to inhomogeneity. Finally, the
precursor complexes may serve as soluble molecular models
for single-site catalysts involving a metal center on the
surface of an oxide support. Other groups have developed so-
called “nonhydrolytic” routes to oxide materials, including
the condensation of metal alkoxides with metal acetates [84]
or metal halides [85].
2. Thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) route
to oxide materials
Much of our early work on exploration of the TMP
method focused on fundamental questions regarding the vi-
ability of this approach to mixed-element oxides and on
investigation of the properties of the resulting materials. Key
comparisons have been made to materials of the same com-
position that were prepared by more traditional aqueous or
sol–gel procedures. Our initial interest centered on metal
oxide–silica materials, for which homogeneity is thought to
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence properties. For example, such materi-
als exhibit increased acidity and higher Brønsted acid site
concentrations with increasing concentrations of M–O–Si
heterolinkages. Another goal is to determine how the struc-
tural and chemical properties of the molecular precursor
inﬂuence the properties (porosity, catalytic efﬁciency, sur-
face acidity, etc.) of the ultimate materials.
The TMP method for materials synthesis works well
for precursors of the type M[OSi(O tBu)3]4 (M = Ti, Zr,
Hf), which convert cleanly to carbon-free materials with the
formula MO2 · 4SiO2. These conversions occur under mild
thermolytic conditions (373–473 K) in the solid state or by

heating solutions of the precursors [57,63]. For example,
thermolysis of Zr[OSi(O tBu)3]4 in toluene at 413 K results
in elimination of 12 equivalents of isobutylene,

+ 12CH2=CMe2 + 6H2O,
and formation of a transparent gel, which upon drying yields
a high-surface-area xerogel (520 m2 g−1).
Solid state 29Si MAS NMR spectra of these ZrO2 · 4SiO2
xerogels, either uncalcined or after calcination at 873 K,
show that the majority of the Si atoms are in Q2 and Q3
environments, attributed to the presence of (ZrO)2Si(OSi)2
and ZrOSi(OSi)3 sites, respectively. These results suggest
that these materials have a high degree of homogeneity [63].
Further evidence of the highly homogeneous nature of ma-
terials made via the TMP route is provided by an EDX
HR-TEM study of a mesostructured ZrO2 · 4SiO2 material,
synthesized via solution thermolysis of Zr[OSi(O tBu)3]4
in the presence of a structure directing block copolymer
[66]. A constant 4:1 Si/Zr ratio was observed throughout
the material using a 10-Å probe scanning at 35-Å intervals
[66]. The presence of a large number of M–O–Si heterolink-
ages in these ZrO2 · 4SiO2 xerogels would be expected to
give rise to a highly acidic material [48]. Hammet acid-
ity [86] measurements of these xerogels indicate that the
Hammet acidity function (Ho) values are between −5.6
and −8.2, which is consistent with high acidity and homo-
geneity [63].
The thermal conversion of complexes containing M–
OSi(O tBu)3 and M–O2P(O tBu)2 moieties appears to be
catalyzed by Brønsted acids [67,76]. In general, when M is
electron poor and Lewis acidic, the thermal decompositions
occur efﬁciently and at low temperatures. The addition of a
catalytic amount of a Lewis or Brønsted acid (AlCl3 or HCl)
has been observed to accelerate elimination of isobutylene
and the formation of a material [63,67,76]. For cases where
conversion of a precursor to a material is slow or occurs
at higher temperatures, the addition of such catalysts can
effectively facilitate synthetic procedures.
In studies on use of the TMP method for generation
of amorphous aluminosilicates, an important class of solid
acid materials, the chemical nature of the precursor has a
profound inﬂuence on the properties of the resultant solid.
This was illustrated, for example, by the fact that Al2O3 ·
2SiO2 materials derived from Al[OSi(O tBu)3]3(HO iPr) ·
1
4[Al(O iPr)3]4 and [(O iPr)2AlOSi(O tBu)3]2 (both with
Al/Si = 1) have quite different microstructures and sur-
face acidities [70]. Thermolysis of a toluene solution of
the former precursor provided a xerogel that, when com-
pared to a similarly derived xerogel from the latter precursor,
had a lower Brønsted acid site concentration (0.8 ± 0.2 vs
2.3 ± 0.2 sites nm−2, by 1H NMR spectroscopy after reac-
tion of the samples with Mg(CH2C6H5)2 · 2THF), a higher
Lewis/Brønsted site ratio (1.6 vs 1.0, by NH3 TPD), and a
microstructure that more closely resembled that of mullite
(by PXRD and DSC). Apparently, the preexisteence of only
Al–O–Si linkages in [(O iPr)2AlOSi(O tBu)3]2 gives rise to
more Brønsted acid sites, whereas the Al–O–Al linkages in
the [Al(O iPr)3]4 component of Al[OSi(O tBu)3]3(HO iPr) ·
1
4[Al(O iPr)3]4 provide a material with more mullite charac-
ter and less Brønsted acidity. Such correlations between the
nature of a precursor and the properties of a material derived
from it should prove useful in the design and synthesis of
tailored catalysts and support materials.
High-surface-areamagnesia–silica xerogels (245 m2 g−1)
and aerogels (640 m2 g−1) with the composition MgO ·
2SiO2 were generated from the single-source molecular
precursor Mg[OSi(O tBu)3]2 using TMP methods [68]. Pre-
vious predictions and experimental evidence for high-SiO2-
content magnesia–silica materials suggested that the number
of acid sites for the mixed oxide would be larger for a
more homogeneous material [87]. In contrast, poorly dis-
persed magnesia–silica materials (containing large SiO2
and MgO domains) were shown to have a higher basic-
ity [88]. Thus, the acid–base properties of magnesia–silica
materials appear to be directly correlated to the degree
of homogeneity. The MgO · 2SiO2 xerogels made from
Mg[OSi(O tBu)3]2 were shown to have a high acid site con-
centration (from NH3 TPD: 2.7 sites nm−2) and a negligible
basicity (from CO2 TPD: 0.13 sites nm−2), suggesting that
these materials contain signiﬁcant numbers of Mg–O–Si het-
erolinkages. Hence, use of the TMP route has generated
high-surface-area magnesia–silica materials that exhibit un-
usually high acidities when compared to similar materials
made via acid-catalyzed sol–gel routes and sulfation (0.3–
2.4 sites nm−2) [88]. In general, it seems that the TMP
method is useful for generating homogeneously dispersed
metal sites in an amorphous SiO2 support matrix [57–73].
Other recent work has provided Cr(IV) and V(IV) com-
plexes of the form (tBuO)nM[OSi(O tBu)3]4−n (n = 2,3)
that efﬁciently convert to carbon-free Cr/Si/O [69] and
V/Si/O [71] materials, respectively, again via elimination
of isobutylene and water:

+ 3H2O,
(3)
M = Cr or V
453 K
→MOx · 2SiO2
+ 8CH2CMe2 + 4H2O.
Additional efforts provided a V(V) single-source molec-
ular precursor, OV[OSi(O tBu)3]3 [72,73]. The synthesis
of multiple V/Si/O single-source precursors with different
oxidation states and silicon contents provided an opportu-
nity to study how the nature of the precursor inﬂuences
the properties of the ﬁnal material [71]. Vanadia–silica
xerogels generated by thermolysis of OV[OSi(O tBu)3]3
in n-octane exhibited phase separation and formation of
268
K.L. Fujdala, T.D. Tilley / Journal of Catalysis 216 (2003) 265–275
V2O5 crystallites at low temperatures (573 K in O2). By
comparison, V/Si/O xerogels derived from solution ther-
molyses of the V(IV) precursors (tBuO)3VOSi(O tBu)3
and (tBuO)2V[OSi(O tBu)3]2 produced V2O5 much more
slowly (673 K in O2). This suggests that the initial materials
derived from the V(IV) precursors are more homogeneous
(by PXRD and TEM) [71].
Interestingly,
a
high-surface-area
Cr/Si/O
xerogel
(∼300 m2 g−1) derived from the solution thermolysis of
(tBuO)3CrOSi(O tBu)3 exhibited higher activity (by a factor
of 3) and selectivity (by 5%) for the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of propane than did a Cr/Si/O material with a similar
(slightly higher) surface area and derived from the same pre-
cursor, but generated by a solid state thermolysis [69]. These
results point to the fact that the speciﬁc conditions for the
thermolyses also play an important role in determining the
properties of the ﬁnal material.
Molecular precursors of the type M[O2P(O tBu)2]n have
been used to obtain phosphates of Zn, Ti, and Al [79–83].
In all of these cases, thermal decomposition of the mole-
cular precursor under mild heating led to the formation
of
homogeneous
M/P/O
materials.
For
example,
[Me2AlO2P(O tBu)2]2 and [(O iPr)2AlO2P(O tBu)2]4 were
used to generate amorphous, high-surface-area AlPO4 xero-
gels (up to 600 m2 g−1) and thin ﬁlms [83,89].
The TMP approach may also be used with electron-rich
metals, as illustrated by the conversion of [CuOSi(O tBu)3]4
to Cu-silica materials [60]. Thermolyses under an atmos-
phere of argon gave Cu0 nanoparticles embedded in silica.
Heating under O2 led to formation of Cu2O and CuO, and at
high temperature only CuO nanoparticles (10–30 nm) were
detected. The mechanism by which this electron-rich com-
plex decomposes is distinct from that of the electropositive
metal examples discussed above, and the formation of signif-
icant amounts of HOSi(O tBu)3 and Cu0 suggests that Cu–O
homolysis may be involved. Using related tetrameric tri-
alkylsiloxide Cu species, similar homolytic processes have
been observed by Caulton and co-workers [90].
3. TMP-derived catalysts for the oxidative
dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane
More recent efforts in our laboratories have focused on
attempts to utilize aspects of synthetic control offered by
the TMP method to produce catalysts that exhibit improved
performance in heterogeneous processes. In this regard,
we have addressed the development of catalysts for selec-
tive transformations of simple hydrocarbons that are readily
available as inexpensive feedstocks [91–94]. A class of re-
actions that has attracted considerable attention involves
the transformation of an alkane to a more valuable oleﬁnic
product [95–97]. One such process is the catalytic dehy-
drogenation of alkanes, but the endothermic nature of this
process requires high temperatures at which cracking and
the deposition of carbon present signiﬁcant problems. Alter-
Scheme 1.
natively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is
thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures and does
not suffer from the detrimental effects of coking [95–97].
Given the widespread use of propylene in the production of
polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide, propane
ODH (Scheme 1) has attracted much attention as an alter-
native source of this industrially useful molecule [95–97].
However, this selective oxidation is difﬁcult to achieve due
to the tendency of propylene to overoxidize to CO and CO2
under the reaction conditions. Recent reviews and reports
on this subject have suggested that vanadium-based cata-
lysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts
for propane ODH [95–118]. Of the support materials that
have been examined, some of the most promising are Al2O3,
ZrO2, and MgO.
From the results mentioned above, the TMP synthetic
route offered the potential to produce catalysts with high
surface areas and homogeneities relative to catalysts that
were known for propane ODH. It was also hoped that use of
this method might provide more controlled transformations
to well-deﬁned materials with high surface densities of the
desired catalytic sites. A further discovery, which allows
tuning of compositions for materials generated by the TMP
method, is that the cothermolysis of different precursors
in solution often results in homogeneous incorporation of
each available building block into the ﬁnal structure [72,84].
This allows versatility in targeting compositions over a wide
range of catalyst formulations.
Using the molecular precursor OV[OSi(O tBu)3]3 as a
source of
vanadium and
the
commercially available
Zr(OCMe2Et)4 as a ZrO2 source, a series of V/Si/Zr/O cat-
alysts with vanadium contents from 2 to 34 wt% V2O5 were
prepared via cothermolysis:

The surface areas of the catalysts prepared via the cother-
molysis route were high, even after calcination at 773 K
(from 300 to 465 m2 g−1). The performance of these ma-
terials as catalysts for propane ODH was evaluated by the
method reported by Iglesia, Bell, and co-workers, which
focuses on intrinsic selectivities (extrapolated to 0% con-
version) that allow useful comparisons between catalysts
[111,112]. The intrinsic selectivities for propylene for-

mation for the V/Si/Zr/O catalysts obtained via cother-
molyses were as high as 95.5% at 673 K (for 23 wt%
vanadia). The observed activities ranged from 28 mmol
propylene produced (g cat)−1 h−1 (673 K, 14% vanadia) to
100 mmol (g cat)−1 h−1 (773 K, 14% vanadia). The pres-
ence of oligomeric tetrahedral vanadium sites appears to
be a key component of the more active compositions (10–
18% vanadia). The V/Si/Zr/O catalysts with 18 and 23%
vanadia were as efﬁcient as the most selective and active
catalysts that had been reported for propane ODH [95–118].
Further comparisons showed that these catalysts were more
active and selective, under the same ODH conditions, than
materials of similar composition but prepared by conven-
tional impregnation methods using NH4VO3-oxalic acid as
the vanadium source. Table 1 provides a summary of some of
the propane ODH data. This initial study on the use of TMP-
derived materials as catalysts therefore suggested that this
synthetic approach might be generally useful for the genera-
tion of catalysts with enhanced performance [72].
An attempt to further improve the performance of vana-
dia-based catalysts for propane ODH targeted silicon-free
compositions, since the silica component is believed to
give rise to Brønsted acid sites that could facilitate sec-
ondary reactions of the propylene product. Such V/Zr/O
catalysts, containing vanadia supported on zirconia, were
readily obtained via thermolyses of solutions containing
OV(O tBu)3 and Zr(OCMe2Et)4 [74]. Upon calcination at
773 K, nanocrystals of ZrO2 were produced and the vana-
dium appeared to be dispersed on the surface of the crys-
tals as oligomeric VOx species in vanadium coordination
environments similar to those in V2O5 (by PXRD and
Raman, DRUV–vis, and 51V NMR spectroscopies). The
vanadia coating inhibits further crystallization of ZrO2 and
helps to maintain a high catalyst surface area. The best
catalyst performance was observed for materials with 10–
18% vanadia content, for which activities were as high as
180 mmol (g cat)−1 h−1, and intrinsic selectivities maxi-
mized at about 90% (see Table 1). The improved properties
observed for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by the TMP cother-
molysis method may be at least partially attributed to higher
surface areas and improved dispersions of VOx species rel-
ative to those in catalysts prepared by conventional means.
The TMP route also appears to give a more controlled and
complete conversion of vanadium species to catalytically ac-
tive oligomeric VOx species.
Kinetic analyses of the propane ODH reactions at 606 K
showed that the value of k1 (the rate of propane ODH;
L mol−1 s−1) was three times greater for the TMP-derived
catalysts than for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by wet impreg-
nation [111,112]. Additionally, catalysts derived from the
270
K.L. Fujdala, T.D. Tilley / Journal of Catalysis 216 (2003) 265–275
TMP method exhibited lower rates for the combustion of
propane (k2), as illustrated by lower k2/k1 ratios (0.02 vs
0.3 at ∼4 VOx nm−2). However, the k3 values (the rate con-
stants for propylene combustion; L mol−1 s−1) were similar
for the two types of catalysts. The latter result is signiﬁcant,
in that dramatic improvements in propane ODH catalysis
appear to hinge on development of catalysts with a much
lower activity for propylene oxidation (low values of k3)
[111,112].
In a similar fashion, propane ODH catalysts with various
V/Al/O compositions were generated by cothermolyses of
OV(O tBu)3 and [Al(O tBu)3]2 [119].

After calcination at 823 K, these catalysts had surface ar-
eas (from 98 to 190 m2 g−1) that were lower than those for
the corresponding V/Zr/O materials. For these catalysts, the
intrinsic selectivities for propylene formation are good and
very similar over a range of vanadium contents (up to 84%
at 673 K, 82% at 723 K, and 79.5% at 773 K). These selec-
tivities are similar to those observed for V/Al/O catalysts
prepared via wet impregnation using NH3VO3/oxalic acid
and Al2O3 (70–90% at 606 K [111]). The activities of the
TMP-derived V/Al/O catalysts, on a per gram basis (up to
49.0 mmol (g cat)−1 h−1 at 773 K), are moderate compared
to those of the TMP-derived V/Zr/O systems (Table 1).
Note that whereas the TMP-derived V/Al/O catalysts are
less selective than their TMP-derived V/Zr/O counterparts
(Table 1), the opposite is true for V/Al/O and V/Zr/O cat-
alyst prepared by wet impregnation [111].
A further modiﬁed version of the TMP method in-
volves the impregnation of a high-surface-area support. This
was accomplished using nanocrystalline MgO, ﬁrst synthe-
sized by Klabunde and co-workers [120], as the support.
This material was impregnated with vanadia by exposing
it to OV(O tBu)3 in nonpolar media [75]. Calcination of
OV(O tBu)3/MgO materials at 823 K led to catalysts with
high surface areas (from 185 to 310 m2 g−1). Based on cat-
alytic and analytical data (PXRD, temperature-programmed
reduction, and Raman, diffuse reﬂectence UV–vis (DRUV–
vis), and 51V NMR spectroscopy), it appears that the most
active catalysts consist of nanocrystalline MgO particles
covered by small Mg3(VO4)2 domains. The formation of
large Mg3(VO4)2 domains is undesirable due to the loss of
accessible vanadium species. At a reaction temperature of
773 K, catalysts with 15 and 25 wt% vanadia exhibited in-
trinsic selectivities of 66 and 79% and activities of 137 and
133 mmol (g cat)−1 h−1, respectively (Table 1). The selec-
tivities of these catalysts are equal to or better than the best
V/Mg/O catalysts previously reported for propane ODH,
and the observed activities are higher than literature values
[106,110,116–118].
4. Molecular precursor route to isolated
catalytic centers
A modiﬁcation of the molecular precursor route de-
scribed above may be used to introduce isolated catalytic
sites onto the surface of an oxide support via simple
chemical reactions. Advantages to this approach include
the increased potential for molecular-level control over the
structure of the catalytic site, the generation of site-isolated
catalysts, and the ease with which the grafting reactions
can be monitored to provide information about the nature
of the grafted moiety. It is important to know several of
the properties of the support prior to performing the graft-
ing reaction. For example, the surface area of the support
will determine the amount of precursor that can be intro-
duced onto the surface. Knowledge of the porosity of the
support is also critical since the precursor molecules (which
can be rather large) must ﬁt into any pores that are present to
allow optimum coverage. Finally, the surface density of re-
active surface sites (i.e., OH groups) can be used to estimate
the potential for reaction of multiple surface sites with one
molecular precursor. With respect to the latter issue, we have
developed a simple method for determining the coverage
of accessible hydroxyl groups on silica, involving reaction
of Mg(CH2C6H5)2 · 2THF with the solid support, followed
by quantiﬁcation of the toluene that is evolved by 1H NMR
spectroscopy [70,79].
We have explored the molecular precursor route to iso-
lated catalytic sites supported on various forms of silica.
The ﬁrst step in the grafting procedure involves chemi-
cal bonding of a M[OSi(O tBu)3]n precursor to the support
via a protonolysis reaction, which results in elimination of
HO tBu and/or HOSi(O tBu)3. The progress of these reac-
tions is easily monitored by solution 1H NMR spectroscopy,
and this provides insight into the nature of the grafted
species. Both M–O–(surface) and Si–O–(surface) linkages
may form in the grafting procedure, and quantiﬁcation of
the species released by these reactions provides information
about the types of sites that are present and the approximate
quantities of each. The as-synthesized catalyst can then be
used for low-temperature reactions or calcined (< 473 K) to
produce reactive, inorganic species of the form MOx ·nSiO2
or MOx · (n −1)SiO2 (with elimination of isobutylene from
the remaining OSi(O tBu)3 ligands of the grafted precursor).
The small amount of additional SiO2 that is formed near the
metal center may provide stability, hence reducing mobility
and phase separation (Scheme 2).
5. Single-site Ti(IV) on SBA-15
The method outlined above was initially investigated for
the introduction of isolated titanium sites onto silica sup-
port materials. Such materials are of interest as selective
oxidation catalysts. For example, several years ago Shell
developed a silica-supported titania catalyst for the epoxida-
K.L. Fujdala, T.D. Tilley / Journal of Catalysis 216 (2003) 265–275
271
Scheme 2.
tion of propylene to propylene oxide [121–123]. Many other
titania-substituted silica materials have been recently studied
in the context of oleﬁn epoxidation, including the molecu-
lar sieves TS1 and TS2, the zeolites Ti-β and Ti-ZSM, and
mesoporous Ti-MCM41 materials with Ti in the walls or
grafted onto the surface [124–135]. The active sites in such
catalysts are believed to contain isolated, tetrahedrally coor-
dinated titanium centers.
Our initial studies in this area involved the precursor
Ti[OSi(O tBu)3]4, which serves as an excellent spectro-
scopic model for isolated, tetrahedral titanium sites due to its
Ti[OSiO3]4 core. This complex was found to provide an efﬁ-
cient route to homogeneous TiO2 · 4SiO2 materials [57,63],
and these were examined as catalysts for the epoxidation of
cyclohexene [76]:
(6)
Ti/Si/O cat

→
The catalytic reactions were carried out in toluene, with
cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) as the oxidant.
A TiO2 · 4SiO2 aerogel obtained by the solution thermol-
ysis of Ti[OSi(O tBu)3]4 was relatively active (2.82 mmol
g−1 min−1), giving a cyclohexene oxide yield of 48.8% af-
ter 2 h at 338 K. However, treatment of aerosil silica with
Ti[OSi(O tBu)3]4 provided a material with 1.01 wt% Ti that,
after calcination at 573 K, was more active (5.28 mmol
g−1 min−1) and selective for the oxidation of cyclohexene
to cyclohexene oxide using CHP as the oxidant (94.4% yield
after 2 h at 338 K). This new catalyst was more than twice
as active as silica treated with Ti(O iPr)4 (the Shell catalyst,
2.08 mmol g−1 min−1) under our reaction conditions, even
on a per titanium basis (∼1500 mol product (mol Ti)−1 h−1
vs ∼600 mol (mol Ti)−1 h−1). Thus, the OSi(O tBu)3 lig-
ands appear to exercise a beneﬁcial effect on the structure of
the supported titanium site, which likely involves OTi(OSi)3
species with pseudotetrahedral Ti centers.
In attempts to optimize catalyst performance, we ex-
tended these studies to include additional types of pre-
cursors and supports with higher surface areas. Precursors
with different Ti/Si ratios were examined to obtain in-
formation about the effects of the OSi(O tBu)3 ligands
on catalyst performance [77]. These investigations utilized
Ti[OSi(O tBu)3]4 [57,63], (iPrO)Ti[OSi(O tBu)3]3 [136],
and (tBuO)3TiOSi(O tBu)3 [137] complexes and three high-
surface-area SiO2 supports (aerosil, MCM-41 [138], and
SBA-15 [139]). For comparison, Ti(O iPr)4 was also used
as a Ti source. During the grafting reaction both tBuOH and
HOSi(O tBu)3 were observed as reaction products, suggest-
ing the presence of two different (but closely related) types
of surface species, although elimination of HOSi(O tBu)3
was the major pathway in all cases. The Ti centers derived
from the siloxide-containing precursors appear to be in iso-
lated TiO4 environments, as indicated by use of DRUV–vis
spectroscopy.
Precursors bearing fewer alkoxysiloxide ligands resulted
in greater titanium incorporation. This presumably results
from lower reactivities of the more sterically encumbered
precursors with the surface –OH groups. However, the pres-
ence of more alkoxysiloxy ligands improves the catalytic
activity by preventing the formation of oligomeric titania
species that are known to exhibit low activities during epox-
idation reactions [140]. These two competing factors point
to the tris(siloxide) (iPrO)Ti[OSi(O tBu)3]3 as the optimum
precursor in this series [77]. For uncalcined catalysts de-
rived from this precursor, the activities for cyclohexene
epoxidation (338 K, toluene, CHP oxidant) over the ﬁrst
10 min of reaction ranged from 3.8 (0.25% Ti) to 11.3
(1.64% Ti) mmol g−1 min−1. When the activities are eval-
uated on a per titanium basis it is evident that as the titanium
content increases the activity decreases (from ∼4400 mol
(mol Ti)−1 h−1 for 0.25% Ti to ∼2000 mol (molTi)−1 h−1
for 1.64% Ti). Calcination of these catalysts at 573 K re-
sulted in a loss of activity (by ca. 50%); however, the
activities are still higher than those previously reported for
272
K.L. Fujdala, T.D. Tilley / Journal of Catalysis 216 (2003) 265–275
Ti/Si/O catalysts, including those prepared via other graft-
ing methods [131,141–143]. The selectivity for cyclohexene
oxide was between 90 and 100% for all of the catalysts
made via grafting of the molecular precursors. The meso-
porous supports (MCM-41 and SBA-15) provided catalysts
with the best performance; however, there was little differ-
ence between the two. The high performance of the Ti/Si/O
catalysts described above appears to result from the highly
dispersed and site-isolated nature of the tetrahedral titanium
centers that arise from the use of the molecular precursor ap-
proach.
6. Single-site iron(III) on SBA-15
Interest in site-isolated iron catalysts for the selective
oxidation of hydrocarbons stems from promising results
reported for the iron-containing zeolite FeZSM-5 (which
may possess isolated iron sites [144–149]) and from the
known abilities of various iron-based enzymes to carry out
selective oxidations [150–154]. Thus, it is important to
investigate the reactivities of well-deﬁned iron sites and to
evaluate the role of various structural parameters on catalytic
activity and selectivity. In this context, it seemed possible
to use a molecular precursor grafting methodology similar
to that described above for the generation of well-deﬁned
surface iron sites.
The molecular precursor Fe[OSi(O tBu)3]3 · THF has
been employed with SBA-15 for the preparation of isolated,
inorganic Fe centers on a mesoporous support [78]. These
investigations have provided catalytic materials that are
active and selective for partial oxidations of hydrocarbons
using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. In this case the
grafting chemistry is quite simple, resulting in elimination
of only HOSi(O tBu)3. This suggests that the grafted iron
centers retain one THF and two siloxide ligands. The
presence of the THF ligand was conﬁrmed by an exchange
reaction whereby the Fe/SBA material was dosed with
excess MeCN. The free THF released by this reaction
corresponds to approximately 1 THF per iron center (by
1H NMR spectroscopy). A number of other analytical and
spectroscopic probes are also consistent with the following
grafted structure:
+

−1HOSi(O tBu)3
Calcination of the FeSBA-15 materials at 573 K resulted
in loss of essentially all of the carbon and hydrogen, and
DRUV–vis spectra revealed charge-transfer bands that were
very similar to those obtained for the uncalcined samples.
Additionally, no bands attributable to octahedral iron(III)
clusters were observed. Thus, calcination does not appear to
form large iron oxide clusters. The majority of the iron sites
maintain their isolated state with tetrahedral coordination
geometry. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies also
provided evidence for the presence of isolated iron(III)
centers with a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Thus, this
precursor method appears to provide a reliable route to well-
deﬁned, isolated, and stable iron centers. Several reports
have described the preparation of Fe species supported on
silica that utilize inorganic iron reagents such as FeCl3 [155–
157], FePO4 [158], and Fe2(SO4)3 · 7H2O [159]; however,
these procedures do not produce stable, isolated surface
species due to the use of aqueous media and calcination
conditions that lead to formation of iron oxide clusters.
Calcined FeSBA-15 materials (573 K, 2 h, O2) were
investigated as catalysts for the partial oxidation of vari-
ous hydrocarbons using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant.
Leaching tests indicated that the observed catalytic reac-
tions were indeed heterogeneous. Oxidation of benzene at
60 ◦C by a 0.50 wt% Fe catalyst resulted in the produc-
tion of phenol with 100% selectivity after 96 h at 42%
hydrogen peroxide conversion and 7.5% benzene conver-
sion. No products were observed from formation of phenyl
radicals, as has been observed previously for related cata-
lysts [160]. The turnover frequency for this particular cat-
alyst was 2.5 × 10−3 mol product (mol Fe)−1 s−1, which
is comparable to those for other (less selective) iron-based
heterogeneous systems [161,162]. The oxidation of toluene
at 333 K using a FeSBA-15 catalyst (1.90 wt% iron) pro-
duced benzaldehyde (32%) and cresol (a mixture of ortho
and para isomers totaling 68%). Interestingly, the activities
of these catalysts (on a per-site basis) do not vary with iron
loading. This is consistent with the presence of isolated and
independent catalytic centers. Cyclooctene epoxidation pro-
ceeded with a very high selectivity for cyclooctene oxide
(99%) with a turnover frequency of 6.2 × 10−4 mol product
(mol Fe)−1 s−1. This selectivity exceeds that of Jacobson’s
recently reported and highly selective iron-based homoge-
neous catalyst that exhibited a selectivity for cyclooctene
oxide production of 86% [163]. Overall, these catalysts op-
erated with selectivities and activities that exceed or are
comparable to other heterogeneous iron-based partial oxi-
dation catalysts.
7. Summary and future
Several recent modiﬁcations of the TMP method have
important implications for the use of this approach in syn-
thesizing new catalysts and catalyst supports with improved
properties. Among these is the ﬁnding that cothermoly-
ses using mixtures of alkoxide precursors in a hydrophobic
solvent yield dispersed metal oxide species within an ox-
K.L. Fujdala, T.D. Tilley / Journal of Catalysis 216 (2003) 265–275
273
ide “support.” This allows considerable ﬂexibility in tuning
the catalyst composition. Examples of this approach in-
clude the cothermolyses of OV(O tBu)3 with Zr[OCMe2Et]4
or [Al(O tBu)3]2, which result in the formation of high-
surface-area V/Zr/O or V/Al/O xerogels, respectively.
These materials exhibit excellent properties as catalysts
for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. In addition,
it has recently been possible to assemble molecular pre-
cursors containing more than two components. For exam-
ple, [(tBuO)3SiO]2Al[µ-O2P(O tBu)2]2Al(Me)OSi(O tBu)3
is an efﬁcient single-source precursor to silicoaluminophos-
phate (SAPO) materials and it is a structural model for
microporous SAPOs [79]. Precursors of this type should of-
fer further aspects of atomic-level control over the structures
of catalytic sites and they should prove to be useful molec-
ular models, especially for catalytic materials that contain
multiple heteroelements. Additionally, the molecular pre-
cursors described here are convenient sources of isolated,
inorganic catalyst sites supported on an oxide such as SiO2.
This is of particular interest given the importance of iso-
lated sites in catalysis [32–37], and the need for control over
the structures of such sites. It appears that additional com-
ponents of the support, attached to the surface by way of
oxygen-rich siloxide ligands (e.g., OSi(O tBu)3), may pro-
vide a stabilized environment that hinders ion mobility and
prevents formation of M–O–M linkages.
The synthetic methods described in this report offer a
number of potential advantages over more established routes
to heterogeneous catalysts. The use of well-deﬁned mole-
cular precursors in the TMP method allows control over
stoichiometry, nanostructure, homogeneity, and catalyst site
structure, depending on various experimental parameters.
The use of nonaqueous solvents in catalyst syntheses can be
beneﬁcial, in that water often has a strong inﬂuence over the
structures that form. The precursors serve as molecular mod-
els for oxide supported catalytic sites, given their M–O–E
heterolinkages and their oxygen-rich nature. It has been
demonstrated that TMP methods can be used to produce cat-
alytic materials that outperform related catalysts obtained by
more traditional routes. Thus, we expect molecular precur-
sor methods to contribute signiﬁcantly to the development of
new generations of catalysts and support materials.
