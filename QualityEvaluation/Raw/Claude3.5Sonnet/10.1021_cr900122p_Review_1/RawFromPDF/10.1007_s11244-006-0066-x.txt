Selective as well as waste forming active centers were deﬁned for MoVNbTeO and MoVTaTeO catalysts in the ammoxidation
of propane to acrylonitrile and all catalytic functionalities were assigned to speciﬁc elements at the respective active centers.
Symbiosis between M1 and M2 phases of these catalysts was observed, with phase cooperation being more extensive in the Nb than
Ta containing compositions. The diﬀerence in catalytic eﬀectiveness arises most likely because contact and surface area exposure of
the two respective, cooperating phase pairs are not equal. The M1 phase of the catalysts is reducible by propane and ammonia in
the absence of dioxygen and is regenerable to its original, fully oxidized state by dioxygen (air). No structural collapse is observed
even after 120 C3H8 + NH3 reduction pulses. The so induced reduction of the catalyst extends up to 70 layers deep. The product
distribution over the ﬁrst few pulses is very similar to that under catalytic conditions, supporting the concept that lattice oxygen is
involved in the catalytic ammoxidation process. Therefore, the ammoxidation of paraﬃns is a redox process, as is of course the
well-known oleﬁn ammoxidation process.

1. Introduction
(Amm)oxidation of propane to acrylonitrile and
acrylic acid, respectively are two important processes
still awaiting improvement in yields, before they can be
commercialized and replace the well established oleﬁn
based processes [1]. The desirability for such a switch is
the far greater availability and substantially lower cost
of the paraﬃn feed. To achieve the desired goal it is
important to understand the intricacies of the paraﬃn
based catalytic processes so that the catalysts can be
altered
and
thereby
be
improved.
One
promising
approach is to identify the active centers of the catalytic
materials and to pinpoint the respective functionalities
associated with the various metals of these centers [2].
Such endeavors should ultimately lead to catalyst
improvements through judicious metal substitutions at
the active centers or their immediate surroundings.
Among the most promising catalysts for propane
ammoxidation
is
the
MoV(Nb,Ta)(Te,Sb)O
system
[2–7]. It is generally agreed that the catalyst is comprised
of at least two phases (M1 and M2) and that M1 is the
paraﬃn-activating phase while M2 is the oleﬁn conver-
sion phase [2,8–13]. All catalytic functionalities of the
active centers of the two phases have been assigned
[2,11]. Symbiosis between the two phases occurs and
thereby leads to signiﬁcantly improved acrylonitrile
yields [2,10–16]. Recently we have also explored the
redox properties of these compositions, showing that
the catalysts are reducible by propane and ammonia in
the absence of dioxygen and that the reduced solids can
again be reoxidized by dioxygen (air) to their original,
oxidized and catalytically active, state [17].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of catalytic materials for the ammoxidation of
propane were prepared with the general precursor com-
position Mo1VxNbyTezOn using published methods
[3,4,18]. A ﬁrst solution was prepared by dissolving
ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium vanadate, and
telluric acid in water at 60 C. This solution was allowed
to cool to room temperature. A second solution was
prepared by dissolving niobic acid in oxalic acid at 60 C
and allowing the solution to cool to room temperature.
The Nb concentration of the ﬁnal solution was 0.4 M and
the oxalate/Nb ratio was 3. The appropriate amount of
the ﬁrst and second solutions were mixed and then dried
by rotary evaporation. The solid product was dried at
120 C for 12 h and calcined at 600 C for 2 h under N2.
A series of catalytic materials with the precursor com-
position Mo1VxTayTezOn were prepared as above except

a Ta oxalate solution was used. The Ta oxalate solution
was prepared by dissolving Ta(OEt)5 in aqueous oxalic
acid at 60 C. The ﬁnal Ta concentration was 0.4 M
and the oxalate/Ta ratio was 3. The nominal composi-
tions of the catalysts were Mo1V0.31Nb0.1Te0.23 (opti-
mal), Mo1V0.31Nb0.125Te0.2 (M1), Mo1V0.31Nb0.04Te0.37
(M2), Mo1V0.31Ta0.1Te0.22 (optimal), Mo1V0.31Ta0.12-
Te0.22
(M1)
and
Mo1V0.3Ta0.06Te0.37
(M2).
These
catalysts were tested as described below and their
performance as a function of the amount of ortho-
rhombic (M1) phase is illustrated in Section 3.3.
2.2. Catalyst testing
The above-prepared materials were tested for cata-
lytic activity in multi-channel ﬁxed bed reactors [19].
The reaction conditions were: 150 mg catalyst charge to
each channel, atmospheric pressure, 420 C, WHSV =
0.25 to 0.1 h)1, feed ratio C3H8/NH3/O2/He = 1/1.2/3/
12. The eﬄuent of the reactor was analyzed by gas
chromatography using a plot-Q and a molsieve column
with FID and TCD detectors, respectively. Conversion,
selectivity, and yield are deﬁned as: Conversion =
(moles C3H8 consumed/moles C3H8 charged) · 100,
Selectivity = (moles product/moles C3H8 consumed) ·
(# C atoms in product/3) · 100, Yield = (moles prod-
uct/moles C3H8 charged) · (# C atoms in product/3) ·
100.

X’Pert
Pro diﬀractometer
using
a Cu Ka source
(k = 0.15406 nm) in 0.01 steps. The SEM images were
taken on a Hitachi S-4300 instrument.
2.3. Symbiosis
In the study of symbiosis, neat M1 and M2 phases, as
well as physical mixtures of them, were prepared as
described earlier [14] and had the following composi-
tions:
(M1)
MoV0.30Nb0.17Te0.14Ox
(5.2 m2/g),
(M2)
MoV0.54Te0.59Ox (1.3 m2/g) and (M2)W) Mo0.3W0.7
V0.54Te0.59Ox (2.1 m2/g). Each of the neat phases was
prepared separately, ground separately to £5 lm pow-
ders, compacted to 0.25–0.425 mm particles and tested.
Physical mixtures were prepared from separately pre-
pared neat phases, ground seperately to £5 lm powders,
then thoroughly mixed and then compacted to 0.25–
0.425 mm particles. The physical mixtures were blended
as 50/50 by weight which resulted in a surface area
ratio of: M1/M2 = 4:1 and M1/M2)W = 2.5:1. The
activity
measurements
were
conducted
at
380 C,
feed
ratios:
propane/ammonia/oxygen/Ar = 6.1/7.0/
18.0/70.2 and with a space velocity varying in the range
3.3–26.3 Ncm3 min g by varying either the ﬂow rate or
the amount of catalyst. From the obtained results the
selectivity to acrylonitrile versus conversion was plotted
as illustrated in Section 3.4.
2.4. Redox pulse experiments
Redox experiments were conducted as described
earlier [17] by pulsing propane + ammonia in the
absence of gaseous oxygen over M1 phase of composi-
tion MoV0.25Nb0.12Te0.11Ox (surface area 14.2 m2/g).
The product distribution as a function of pulse number
(reduction) was recorded. From that data and the
knowledge of the compositional makeup of selective and
waste forming centers on the basal (001) plane of M1
[2,11] it is possible to calculate the degree of reduction at
the various stages of reduction. Thus reduction levels at
6, 12 and 120 pulses were calculated and are discussed in
Section 3.5 below.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The active centers of M1 and M2 of MoVNbTeO
catalysts
In earlier work [2,8] we have identiﬁed the active
centers of both, M1 and M2 phases (Figures 1, 2) and
note distinct diﬀerences between them. The M1 phase
contains V5
+ sites, which the M2 phase does not; they
are considered the paraﬃn activating sites. The presence
of V5
+ sites is, however, not suﬃcient for useful catal-
ysis; the sites must be located adjacent to a heptagonal
channel which the paraﬃn to be activated at least par-
tially enters in the activation process [12,20]. The M1
phase, by virtue of its unique structure possesses the
Figure 1. Active center on the basal plane (001) of M1 phase of
MoVNbTeO catalysts.
R.K. Grasselli et al./Active centers, catalytic behavior, symbiosis and redox properties
8
desired heptagonal channels and the V5
+ sites are spa-
tially strategically located along these channels. The M2
phase possesses neither V5
+ sites nor heptagonal chan-
nels and is therefore not capable of activating paraﬃns.
The active centers of M1 are located on the surface of
their basal planes (001) and contain all needed key cat-
alytic functionalities properly arranged within bonding
distance of each other to convert propane directly to
acrylonitrile (Figure 1). The V5
+ site (M7) is the paraf-
ﬁn-activating site, Te4
+ (M12) the a-H abstracting site,
Mo6
+ (M4) the NH inserting site and another adjacent
Mo6
+ (M5) the acrylonitrile ﬁnishing site. In this
8e) oxidation process four surface lattice oxygen’s [O]LS
are involved in the overall reaction.
Four Nb sites surrounded by 5 Mo atoms form
‘‘pinwheels’’; these delineate each active center on the
surface of the basal plane and separate them spatially
from each other. The thereby achieved spatial separa-
tion provides for the necessary site isolation [21,22] of
the active centers, leading to the desired selectivity
properties of the M1 phase towards acrylonitrile for-
mation [2,13].
The M2 active center (Figure 2) is comprised of a
Te4
+ (Te1 or Te2) site responsible for the a-H abstrac-
tion of the oleﬁn (propylene), an adjacent Mo6
+ (M4)
site responsible for the NH insertion, and a spectator
Mo6
+ (M3, M4 or M5) site, which ﬁnishes oﬀthe
acrylonitrile reaction. As already mentioned this center,
lacking the appropriate V5
+ sites, is not capable of
paraﬃn activation and is therefore inactive for propane
conversion. However, it is an excellent catalyst for the
conversion of propylene to acrylonitrile and superior to
M1 for this reaction [10, 11, 13, 14]. Among others, the
excellent oleﬁn conversion lies in its rather high con-
centration of a-H abstracting Te4
+ sites; the oleﬁn
(propylene) activating sites. Therefore, the M2 phase
can serve as a useful mop-up co-catalyst to the M1 phase
in mixtures of the two, complimenting each other under
certain reaction conditions. This matter will be more
thoroughly discussed below in the section pertaining to
symbiosis (Section 3.4).
The overall process of converting propylene to acry-
lonitrile is a 6e) oxidation. The reaction mechanism of
this process is similar to that over BiMoO catalysts [2].
The function which Bi3
+ provides in BiMoO systems is
provided here by Te4
+ of the M2 phase (e.g. lone pair of
electrons). The functions of the adjacent Mo6
+ and its
spectator Mo6
+ are, respectively identical in the two
catalyst systems.
3.2. The active centers of M1 and M2 of MoVTaTeO
catalysts
The M1 phase of MoVTaTeO system is structurally
essentially identical to that of MoVNbTeO described
above. We note already in the synthesis of the Ta M1
phase that it is more easily formed than the Nb equiv-
alent and that less Ta is required in solution to form the
M1 phase. This is also consistent with the early synthetic
and structural work of Ekstro
¨ m et al. [23,24] using
Group V elements as structure directing moieties in the
synthesis of complex molybdenum oxides. He found
that complex open structures of molybdenum oxides
were stabilized with Group V elements in the order
Ta > Nb > V. While the stability of the crystalline
materials is governed by thermodynamics, the synthesis
process is governed by kinetics of the nanoparticles as
they form and assemble in solution [25]. Therefore, it is
understandable why Ta dominates the inclusion process
over Nb or V. We observe [26] that in corresponding M1
crystals less Ta than Nb is occupied by the pentagonal
bipyramides and that Ta can occupy various Mo6
+ or
V4
+ positions. The V5
+ positions remain essentially the
same in either specimen. This results in an M1 active
center that is structurally virtually the same as that of its
Nb cousins, but for the variance in the chemical makeup
as described. Therefore, some diﬀerence in catalytic
behavior between the two might be expected, although
as will be seen below (Section 3.3) this diﬀerence is not
very large.
The M2 phase of MoV(Ta)TeO should by deﬁnition
be identical to that of MoV(Nb)TeO since neither
Figure 2. Active center on the basal plane (001) of M2 phase of
MoVTeO catalysts.
R. K. Grasselli et al./Active centers, catalytic behavior, symbiosis and redox properties
9
should contain any Nb or Ta. The phase should be
simply MoVTeO. In actuality, small amounts of Nb and
Ta do enter the M2 phase if it is synthesized in the
presence of either Nb or Ta ions, as is the case in the in
situ one container preparations of the respective optimal
catalytic compositions, both lying in the range of about
60% M1 and 40% M2.
3.3. Comparison of MoVNbTeO and MoVTaTeO
catalysts
The XRD’s of the Nb and Ta M1 and M2 phases, as
well as, the optimum catalytic M1 + M2 phases are
shown, respectively in Figures 3 and 4. As can be seen
there are no obvious structural diﬀerences indicated
between the Nb and Ta containing systems.
The SEM images of representative M1, M2, and
optimum catalytic M1 + M2 mixtures of MoVNbTeO
and MoVTaTeO systems, respectively are depicted in
Figures 5 and 6. The samples are ground and are iden-
tical to those used in catalytic tests. In general the M1
phase is somewhat more needle like in its habitat than is
M2, which is more platelet like. Both of these observa-
tions have been made already earlier for the MoVNb-
TeO system [2,27]. The M1 phase of the MoVTaTeO
system appears to be somewhat less needle like than that
of MoVNbTeO system. However, overall the diﬀerences
of the habitat are rather minor between these two sys-
tems.
The catalytic behavior of the two families of catalysts
is illustrated in Figure 7. Acrylonitrile (AN) yield is
plotted against the percent of the M1 orthorhombic
phase. It is apparent that in both families the M2 phase
is ineﬀective for paraﬃn conversion as expected, based
on their compositional makeup, as discussed above. The
neat M1 phase of the Nb containing system is slightly
superior (43% AN) to that of the Ta system (41% AN).
The diﬀerence is rather small and could be caused by
many minor compositional or topological diﬀerences.
Remarkable is the large diﬀerence in the symbiotic
behavior of the two respective optimal compositions
around 60% M1 + 40% M2 phase. The Nb containing
system yields a symbiotic acrylonitrile yield of about
62% AN while the Ta system yields only about 42%
AN. Why this large diﬀerence? The two M1 phases give
almost the same AN yields and both M2 phases show
inactivity towards paraﬃns and are expected to exhibit
essentially identical behavior towards oleﬁns (propyl-
ene). The only obvious explanation of this large diﬀer-
ence in symbiotic performance lies probably in a
diﬀerence in surface areas and contact behavior of the
respective phase pairs, depending on whether the opti-
mal composition was prepared from Nb or Ta con-
taining precursors. SEM images show no obvious
diﬀerences of texture between the respective optimal
pairs. Additional studies are needed to arrive at a more
exact explanation of the observed catalytic diﬀerence.
3.4. Symbiosis between M1 and M2 phases
Several investigators [2,5,6,11,15,16] have reported
improvement in product yields as a result of the coop-
eration of two or more phases in the MoVNbTeO sys-
tem. In these studies, the optimal catalytic compositions
were prepared in an in situ one-pot synthesis, whereby
the two phases (M1 and M2) or precursors thereof
formed already in solution had ample opportunity to
intermingle. More recently [10,13,14] we also clearly
demonstrated the existence of the symbiotic eﬀect
between these phases (M1 and M2), when they were
prepared separately (two pot synthesis), ground sepa-
rately and mixed subsequently for catalytic testing.
These combined studies permitted us to deﬁne the
boundaries and limitations of the symbiotic eﬀect. The
catalytic synergy exhibits itself when both phases have a
maximum particle size of £5 lm and that they are
thoroughly intermixed. For optimal catalytic eﬀective-
ness,
the
two
phases
must
be

[2,15,16,22,28]. When they are amorphous, lacking long-
range order, they are catalytically much less eﬀective
and lack long term stability [2].
Complimentary to the single-pot in situ prepared
M1/M2 mixtures showing symbiosis [2], physical mix-
tures of M1 + M2 prepared and ground separately and
mixed subsequently were now investigated for phase
interaction. As a typical example of this type of inter-
action, separately prepared M1 phase of composition
MoV0.30Nb0.17Te0.14Ox was combined with a separately
prepared
M2
phase
having
the
composition
of
MoV0.54Te0.59Ox
[14].
In
a
second
set
of
experi-
ments, the same M1 phase was commingled with a
tungsten substituted M2 (M2)W) phase of composition
(Mo0.3W0.7)V0.54Te0.59Ox.
The
cooperative
phase
behavior of both sets of catalysts is illustrated in
Figure 8. In both instances, symbiosis is observed only
under the already earlier observed requirements of small
particle size ( £5 lm) and intimate mixing of phases
[13,14]. The symbiotic eﬀect at a 20% conversion level
manifests itself in a 47% AN selectivity for the former
mixture of phases vs. 34% for neat M1 and a 37% AN
selectivity for mixtures of M1 + M2 particles exceeding
the 5 lm limitation. Using the tungsten substituted
(M2)W) catalyst as one of the phase pairs, the observed
symbiotic AN selectivity at 20% conversion is essen-
tially the same as that for the unsubstituted (M2) base
pair mixture, namely 48%. Thus, the enhancement due
to symbiosis for physical mixtures of M1 + M2 or
M1 + M2)W with particle size of £5 lm is about 38%
over neat M1 (also £5 lm particle size) and 27% over
M1 + M2 particles having a too large grain size
(i.e., >
5 lm). Aside from the symbiosis eﬀect it is wor-
thy to note that an M2 catalyst having 70% of its Mo
content substituted by W (M2)W) behaves catalytically
very similar to its all Mo parent; i.e., as a mop-up cat-
alyst in M1/M2 mixtures converting propylene to acry-
lonitrile. This implies that a rather large amount of the
molybdenum
moieties
in
the
M2
phase
of
the
MoV(Nb,Ta)TeO catalysts are not involved in the cat-
alytic process. In a parallel study [29] we explore the
Figure 5. SEM of M1, M2, and M1 + M2 (catalytic optimum) of MoVNbTeO catalysts.

subject of substitutions, where preliminary results sug-
gest a fruitful area of study with the promise of dis-
covering more eﬃcient catalysts. Thus an optimization
of the Mo/W ratio in M2 compositions strongly inﬂu-
ences not only the activity but also the selectivity
towards acrylonitrile [29].
With symbiosis illustrated between M1 and M2
phases for the MoVNbTeO and MoVTaTeO systems
comprising M1 + M2 mixtures prepared in a one-pot in
situ synthesis and for physical mixtures of M1 + M2
phases of diverse chemical compositions synthesized
separately
and
subsequently
mixed,
expands
the
knowledge and scope of the phase cooperation phe-
nomenon. It still remains to be demonstrated that
symbiosis occurs between any paraﬃn activating and
oleﬁn converting catalyst pairs. Probably some limita-
tions will present themselves, namely lack of proper
contact between the phases or chemical incompatibility
of phases.
3.5. Redox behavior of MoVNbTeO catalysts
MoV(Nb,Ta)(Te,Sb)O catalysts exhibit redox prop-
erties in the catalytic cycle of the (amm)oxidation
reaction. This behavior is demonstrated here on the
M1 phase of MoVNbTeO catalyst. An essentially
pure M1 sample (trace of M2) prepared by hydro-
thermal
synthesis
and
having
a
composition
of
MoV0.25Nb0.11Te0.17Ox
or
equivalently
written
as
Mo7.8V1.95Nb0.86Te1.33Ox was investigated as a repre-
sentative sample of this catalyst family [17]. Redox
experiments were conducted by pulsing propane and
NH3 over the catalyst (Figure 9). The experimental
range was 1–120 pulses. Indeed the catalyst can be
reduced by propane and ammonia in the absence of
dioxygen, conﬁrming that the ammoxidation process
over this catalyst family and more narrowly over the M1
phase of the MoVNbTeO catalyst is truly a redox pro-
cess involving the lattice oxygen of the solid. Further, it
is signiﬁcant that the product distribution in the early
pulses is similar to that obtained under catalytic condi-
tions in the presence of gaseous oxygen (air). This is
further support for lattice oxygen being involved in the
actual catalytic process.

From the pulse reduction experiments it becomes
apparent that a substantial amount of lattice oxygen
[O]L can be removed from the M1 phase without
structural collapse. Even after 120 C3H8 + NH3 pulses
the lattice parameters of the investigated phase are vir-
tually unchanged [17]. From the pulse data it can be
calculated that after120 C3H8 + NH3 pulses up to 70
layers of the M1 crystals are involved in the reduction
process. The assumptions for this calculation are that
the reduction occurs only from the basal planes of the
M1 crystals and that the catalytic site distribution on the
surface of the M1 basal plane of MoVNbTeO proposed
earlier [11] holds, namely being 44% active, 10% waste
and 46% inactive. It is further assumed, based on this
model, that conversion of propane and ammonia to
acrylonitrile occurs exclusively on these selective surface
centers removing 4 [O]LS from it per catalytic event.
Similarly, the conversion of propane to COx occurs on
the waste forming centers removing 10 [O]LS per cata-
lytic event. It is further assumed that the respective
selective and waste forming surface sites, once reduced
become reoxidized by the underlying [O]L, from within
the crystal. It is further assumed in this calculation that
the composition of the underlying layers is identical to
that of the surface. Thus only lattice oxygens from
equivalent, underlying sites are involved in the reoxi-
dation. In this manner reduced channels ensue below the
active center which remains oxidized until the reoxida-
tion process from within cannot keep up with the
reduction of the surface center and at which point the
reaction
stops.
This
model
certainly
oversimpliﬁes
the true redox process, because there will be ‘‘crosstalk’’
between the reduced and oxidized areas of the catalyst;
it is simply a model which allows pondering about the
catalyst’s intrinsic properties.
We envision the reduction process of the selective
catalytic center (Figure 1) [2,11], which comprises the
oxidation process of the propane and ammonia mole-
cule to acrylonitrile, to involve 1M7, 1M4, 1M12 and
1M5 site, each giving up 1[O] and 1e). Since the
ammoxidation process is an 8e) process it is necessary to
dispense of additional 4e). We propose that this occurs
by involving the second half of the active center, namely
the complimentary set of 1 M7, 1M4, 1M12 and 1M5
sites. In this manner eight elements of the center are
reduced, each by 1e- as seen in Figure 10, thereby dis-
tributing the charge over the entire center. In this pro-
cess, 4 [O]LS were removed producing one acrylonitrile.
The center now awaits its reoxidation, which is pro-
posed to occur through diﬀusion of [O]L from within the
crystal towards the surface.
In a manner similar to the selective process, the waste
forming process is thought to occur on the waste
forming centers of the basal plane of the M1 crystals. In
this process 10[O]LS are involved per catalytic event.
And according to our active center site description [11]
there are 10 surface lattice oxygens available at the waste
forming center as follows: 2M7, 2M4, 2M12, 2M5 and
2M8. As already discussed [2], two V5
+ sites per active
center in respective M7 positions create a waste forming
center (see Figure 1 and distribution probabilities in
[11]). The waste forming process requires 20e), therefore
another 10 elements must be identiﬁed where the
remaining charge can be distributed. Likely candidates
in the proximity are: 2M3, 4M6, 2M10 and 2M8. A
reduced waste forming center with its 10 surface lattice
oxygens removed and the reducing charge of 20 e- dis-
bursed over the entire active center is shown in Fig-
ure 11. Again, it is assumed that underlying lattice
oxygens regenerate the surface center in the pulse
experiments until the process exhausts itself and the
reaction stops. This actually did not occur in its entirety
even after 120 pulses since some waste still continues to
form even at this deep reduction level of the solid.
Another interesting conclusion can be drawn from
the analysis of the product distribution over the ﬁrst six
reduction pulses (Figure 9). At this point, 0.46% of the
total lattice oxygen is removed with the reduction pro-
ceeding 14 layers deep; accepting our proposed reduc-
tion assumptions mentioned above. It is noted that over
these six pulses the selectivity to AN is relatively con-
stant at about 55% and that to propylene about 22%.
Thereafter, the selectivity to AN drops dramatically and

that to propylene increases signiﬁcantly. This suggests
that at this reduction level of the catalyst Te4
+ is
reduced to Te(3
+) or Te2
+ impairing the a-H abstraction
of the adsorbed propylene molecule and hence indirectly
impairing the NH insertion function. The production of
AN ceases. However, the center is still able to produce
propylene, meaning that the propane activating function
of V5
+ (M7) is still in tact. From ﬁrst principles of redox
chemistry it can be reasoned that the regenerability of
the elements involved in the reduction of the active
center will be V4
+/5
+ Mo5
+/6
+ > Te2
+/(3
+)/4
+, with
V5
+ being restored ﬁrst, followed by Mo6
+, followed by
Te4
+. Thus, a partial regeneration of the selective center
by accepting one [O]L from the bulk and thereby
transferring 2e) to the bulk, creates a surface active
center still capable of oxidizing propane to propylene,
but not further to AN. Such a partially reoxidized center
is illustrated in Figure 12. It is envisioned that the 1st H
abstraction from propane occurs again on a V5
+ (M7)
site, just like in the selective ammoxidation process when
the active center is fully oxidized [2]. However, since
now Te4
+ is absent, the 2nd H abstraction is performed
by a Mo6
+ (M6 or M4) site yielding a propylene mole-
cule which desorbs without further transformation to
AN, at the center. The H abstraction by a Mo6
+ moiety
results in a Mo5
+ mono-oxo species, which has a triply-
bonded Mo = O character, known as the ‘‘spectator
oxo’’ eﬀect proposed by Goddard and Rappe [30]. This
constellation is estimated to add about 13–18 kcal/mole
of driving force to the 2nd H abstraction reaction on
Mo6
+ di-oxo centers [31]. However, since the process
only involves a 2e) oxidation, any combination of
adjacent V5
+ - Mo6
+ - Mo6+/5+ moieties should be able
to perform this task. The same, partly reoxidized active
centers (Figure 12) are deemed also capable of oxidizing
NH3 to N2.
Beyond the ﬁrst six pulses, the activity of the catalyst
(Figure 9) declines signiﬁcantly. Both, the conversion of
propane as well as that of ammonia decline in tandem,
with propane conversion dropping faster. Although
more (3) lattice oxygens are required to convert NH3 to
N2 than are to convert propane to propylene (1) the
reactivity at this catalyst reduction level does not follow
the simple stoichiometric oxygen requirement of the
reaction. Presumably the higher basicity of the NH3
molecule over propane dictates the reaction sequence
through preferential chemisorption on the active center
of the partly reduced catalyst. The abrupt drop in
activity further portends that the reoxidation of the
surface centers through the bulk lattice oxygens slows

down substantially once a few (e.g. 14) layers of the
catalyst have become partly reduced.
Signiﬁcant amounts of lattice oxygen can be removed
without structural collapse from the M1 structure [17].
According to our estimate after 6 (C3H8 + NH3) pulses
14 layers of the crystal are reduced, which is equivalent
to 0.46% of the total lattice oxygen having been
removed. After 12 pulses 19 layers are reduced (0.62%
[O]L removed) and after 120 pulses 70 layers (2.4% [O]L
removed). If a catalyst, reduced by 120 C3H8 + NH3
pulses, is reoxidized with pulses of gaseous dioxygen
(air) then the calculated number of reduced layers is 56,
equivalent to 1.9% of the total lattice oxygen. This
apparent discrepancy, 70 vs. 56 layers is not unusual,
since it is essentially impossible to completely reoxidize a
signiﬁcantly reduced oxidation catalyst with a limited
number of oxygen (air) pulses. To achieve complete
reoxidation it is necessary to expose the catalyst to a
ﬂow of oxygen (air) for about 15 min at reaction tem-
perature or shorter at a somewhat higher temperature.
Therefore, the 70-layer estimate is considered a more
realistic assessment of the 120 pulse (C3H8 + NH3)
reduction than the 56-layer estimate.
In sum, the ammoxidation process of propane to
acrylonitrile over MoVNbTeO catalysts is a redox pro-
cess, most likely following a Mars van Krevelen [32]
mechanism, or a modiﬁcation thereof.
4. Conclusions
1) Through judicious analysis of XRD, ND, HREM,
SEM data, as well as, application of sound chemical
concepts, theory and analysis of catalytic data, the
structure and composition of the active centers of M1
and M2 phases of MoV(Nb,Ta)TeO catalysts were
determined. All catalytic functionalities of the active
and selective centers, as well as, waste forming cen-
ters, could be assigned to speciﬁc metals.
2) Symbiosis between M1 and M2 mixtures was dem-
onstrated for propane ammoxidation and conditions
for its occurrence deﬁned. Phase cooperation occurs
with one-pot in situ synthesized phase mixtures, as
well as with separately prepared phases that are
physically mixed post synthesis.
3) Redox behavior of MoVNbTeO catalysts was ob-
served and deﬁned. Redox driven interactions of the
active centers between the surface and the bulk could
be ascertained and mechanistically interpreted. M1
crystals could be reduced with C3H8 + NH3 pulses,
whereby up to 70 layers were involved in the reduc-
tion process. The M1 crystallites could be restored to
their original fully reoxidized state and without
structural collapse using dioxygen (air) pulses.
4) A moderately reduced MoVNbTeO catalyst (M1
phase), produces propylene as its major useful
product under anaerobic ammoxidation conditions.
This observation could be developed further, leading
ultimately to the discovery of a useful propane to
propylene oxydehydrogenation process.
5) The possible role which dislocations, if at all present,
might play in the catalysis of MoV(Nb,Ta)(Te,Sb)O
solids remains unanswered at this junction. Addi-
tional TEM experiments employing spherically cor-
rected electron optics are warranted.
6) A focused, well thought out and intelligent combina-
torial methodology program should be initiated with
the aim of scanning substantial regions of the periodic
table to identify new chemical compositions for
selective paraﬃn activation and their subsequent
selective (amm)oxidation. If combinations of elements
are chosen based on sound chemistry, structural
considerations and experience-rich intuition, new
catalytic systems of interest should be identiﬁable.
