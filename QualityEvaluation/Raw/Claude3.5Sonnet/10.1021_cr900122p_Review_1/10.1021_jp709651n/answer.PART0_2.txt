[1] "In most cases, the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxides occurs through the so-called Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, 4-5 in which the organic molecule reacts with the lattice oxygen, and then the oxygen vacancy is replenished by gaseous oxygen."

[2] "As a result, the redox properties of oxides influence their ability to complete such a catalytic cycle. Thus, the desire for developing a good catalyst with both high reactivity and selectivity calls for a molecular-level understanding of the redox properties of the oxides."

[3] "Here we present a theoretical study to elucidate the relationship between the reactivity and physicochemical properties of the active oxygen center. We disclose that transition metal oxides behaves like free radicals, which can abstract an H atom from alkanes to give a surface hydroxyl group (OH)."

[4] "We conclude that the H abstraction barrier can correlate well with the reaction enthalpy as the difference of BE(CH) and BE(OH). Thus, for a given alkane, the strength of the OH bond plays a central role in determining the reactivity of the metal oxide."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Based on the provided literature:

1. Catalysts: The study focuses on high-valence d0 transition metal oxides, particularly V, Cr, Mo, and W oxides. These catalysts play a crucial role in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.

2. Reaction Mechanism: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is prevalent, where the organic molecule reacts with lattice oxygen, followed by replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gaseous oxygen. The key step involves H-abstraction from alkanes by the metal oxide, behaving like a free radical.

3. Selectivity and Conversion Challenges: The literature doesn't directly address selectivity issues, but it emphasizes the importance of understanding redox properties of oxides to develop catalysts with both high reactivity and selectivity.

4. Factors Influencing Efficiency:
   a) OH bond strength: This is central in determining the reactivity of the metal oxide.
   b) Redox properties: These influence the catalyst's ability to complete the catalytic cycle.
   c) H abstraction barrier: This correlates with the reaction enthalpy, which is the difference between CH and OH bond energies.

5. Site Isolation: The provided literature doesn't explicitly discuss site isolation.

The study provides insights into the fundamental aspects of ODH catalysis, focusing on the relationship between catalyst properties and reactivity. However, it doesn't directly address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding supported systems, specific selectivity challenges, or site isolation. The research aims to provide a molecular-level understanding of oxide properties to guide the development of more efficient catalysts for selective oxidation processes.
