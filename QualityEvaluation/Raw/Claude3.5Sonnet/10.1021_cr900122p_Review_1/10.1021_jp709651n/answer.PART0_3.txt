[1] "Besides the well-known industrial process, i.e., the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, there are some other important examples under active investigation. These include the oxidation of methane to methanol or formaldehyde, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene, (am)oxidation of propane to acrolein or acrylonitrile, etc."

[2] "The common feature of these reactions is that all of them use the high-valence transition metal oxides, such as vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, as catalysts."

[3] "In most cases, the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxides occurs through the so-called Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, in which the organic molecule reacts with the lattice oxygen, and then the oxygen vacancy is replenished by gaseous oxygen."

[4] "The roles that a good catalyst play involve (i) the effective activation of the first C–H bond, (ii) the directional transformation of the resulting intermediates into the partial oxidation product, and (iii) a fast reoxidation of the reduced surface."

[5] "When the M–O bond is too weak, such as a Cr–O, regeneration of the lattice oxygen can be a big issue in order to complete the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. If the M–O bond is too strong, such as W–O, the penalty to open the M–O π bond is too high, such that abstracting an H atom from alkanes can be hard to accomplish. The requirement of a good catalyst is only fulfilled when the metal oxide can have an appropriate M–O bond, such as those in the V and Mo oxides."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process involving various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses several key aspects:

Catalysts: High-valence transition metal oxides, particularly vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, are commonly used. The choice of catalyst significantly impacts the process efficiency.

Reaction mechanism: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is prevalent, where the organic molecule reacts with lattice oxygen, followed by replenishment of the oxygen vacancy from the gas phase.

Challenges in selectivity and conversion: A good catalyst must effectively activate the C-H bond, transform intermediates into partial oxidation products, and quickly reoxidize the reduced surface. Balancing these factors is crucial for achieving high selectivity and conversion.

Metal-oxygen bond strength: The strength of the M-O bond plays a critical role. Too weak (e.g., Cr-O) and the lattice oxygen regeneration becomes problematic; too strong (e.g., W-O) and H-abstraction from alkanes becomes difficult. Vanadium and molybdenum oxides offer an appropriate balance.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss site isolation, it implies that the nature of the metal-oxygen bond at specific sites is crucial for catalyst performance. The interplay between these factors collectively influences process efficiency by determining the catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds, control product formation, and maintain catalytic activity through oxygen replenishment.

The document doesn't provide specific information on supported systems or M-alkyl intermediates, but it emphasizes the importance of understanding the physicochemical properties of active oxygen centers for improving catalyst design and performance in selective oxidation reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个涉及各种催化剂和反应机理的复杂过程。文献讨论了几个关键方面：

催化剂：常用的是高价态过渡金属氧化物，特别是钒、铬、钼和钨的氧化物。催化剂的选择对过程效率有显著影响。

反应机理：Mars-van Krevelen机理普遍存在，其中有机分子与晶格氧反应，然后从气相补充氧空位。

选择性和转化率的挑战：一个好的催化剂必须有效地活化C-H键，将中间产物转化为部分氧化产物，并快速再氧化还原表面。平衡这些因素对实现高选择性和转化率至关重要。

金属-氧键强度：M-O键的强度起着关键作用。太弱（如Cr-O）会导致晶格氧再生问题；太强（如W-O）会使从烷烃中提取H变得困难。钒和钼氧化物提供了适当的平衡。

虽然文献没有明确讨论位点隔离，但它暗示了特定位点上金属-氧键的性质对催化剂性能至关重要。这些因素的相互作用通过决定催化剂活化C-H键、控制产物形成和通过氧补充维持催化活性的能力，共同影响过程效率。

文档没有提供关于负载型系统或M-烷基中间体的具体信息，但它强调了理解活性氧中心的物理化学性质对改进催化剂设计和选择性氧化反应性能的重要性。
