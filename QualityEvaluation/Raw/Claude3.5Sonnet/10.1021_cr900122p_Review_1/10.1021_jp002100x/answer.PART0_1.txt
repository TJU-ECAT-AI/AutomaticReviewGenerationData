The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, aiming to achieve high selectivity and conversion. The study focuses on ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts for propane ODH.

The main challenges in ODH are achieving high selectivity while maintaining good conversion rates. The primary desired product is propene, but unwanted carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts through parallel and sequential oxidation steps. This competition between desired and undesired products is a key challenge in optimizing the process efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle. The kinetically relevant step involves the dissociation of C-H bonds in propane, which is irreversible and uses lattice oxygen atoms. This leads to the formation of alkyl intermediates, which then desorb as propene. The remaining OH groups recombine to form water and create reduced Mo centers, which are subsequently reoxidized by O2 chemisorption.

Site isolation, while not explicitly discussed in the given excerpts, can play a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, it may be possible to limit over-oxidation reactions that lead to COx formation, thus improving selectivity towards the desired propene product.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition and structure: The study compares supported MoOx, bulk MoO3, and ZrMo2O8 catalysts, finding similar active centers on their surfaces.

2. Reaction conditions: The partial pressures of propane, oxygen, and water affect the reaction rates and selectivity.

3. C-H bond activation: The irreversible nature of this step and its reliance on lattice oxygen are critical for the overall reaction mechanism.

4. Redox cycle: The balance between the reduction of Mo centers and their reoxidation by O2 is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

By understanding and optimizing these factors, researchers can work towards improving the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process, making it more viable for industrial applications.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，旨在实现高选择性和高转化率。该研究主要关注ZrO2负载的MoOx催化剂用于丙烷ODH反应。

ODH的主要挑战是在保持良好转化率的同时实现高选择性。主要目标产物是丙烯，但不需要的碳氧化物（COx）通过并行和连续氧化步骤形成副产品。这种目标产物和非目标产物之间的竞争是优化过程效率的关键挑战。

提出的反应机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环。动力学相关步骤涉及丙烷中C-H键的断裂，这是不可逆的，并使用晶格氧原子。这导致形成烷基中间体，然后脱附为丙烯。剩余的OH基团重新结合形成水并创建还原的Mo中心，随后通过O2化学吸附再氧化。

虽然在给出的摘录中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离可以在解决选择性问题方面发挥关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，可能限制导致COx形成的过度氧化反应，从而提高对目标丙烯产物的选择性。

过程效率受几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成和结构：该研究比较了负载型MoOx、块状MoO3和ZrMo2O8催化剂，发现它们表面上存在相似的活性中心。

2. 反应条件：丙烷、氧气和水的分压影响反应速率和选择性。

3. C-H键活化：这一步骤的不可逆性及其对晶格氧的依赖对整个反应机理至关重要。

4. 氧化还原循环：Mo中心的还原和O2再氧化之间的平衡对维持催化剂活性至关重要。

通过理解和优化这些因素，研究人员可以努力提高ODH过程的效率和选择性，使其更适合工业应用。
