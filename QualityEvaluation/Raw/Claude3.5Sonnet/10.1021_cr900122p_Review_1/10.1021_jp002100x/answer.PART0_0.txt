[1] "Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify the elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts."

[2] "Propene is the primary product and carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts via propane and propene combustion."

[3] "These data indicate that the kinetically relevant steps in propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion involve the dissociation of CH bonds in the respective reactant."

[4] "These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism in which two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of C–H bond in propane."

[5] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

1. Catalysts: The study focuses on ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, as well as bulk MoO3 and ZrMo2O8. These catalysts show similar reaction mechanisms, suggesting that the active centers on their surfaces are comparable.

2. Selectivity and conversion challenges: The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity to the desired alkene (propene in this case) while maintaining high conversion. The formation of unwanted byproducts (COx) via combustion reactions competes with the desired dehydrogenation pathway.

3. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence:
   a. C-H bond activation: Lattice oxygen atoms participate in the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane.
   b. M-alkyl intermediates: The resulting alkyl species form on the catalyst surface.
   c. 2H-abstraction: This step leads to the formation and desorption of propene.

4. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by:
   a. The rate of propene formation vs. combustion reactions
   b. The ability of the catalyst to activate C-H bonds selectively
   c. The rate of catalyst reoxidation by O2

5. Site isolation: Although not explicitly discussed in the given excerpts, site isolation can play a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, unwanted secondary reactions (like propene combustion) can be minimized, potentially improving selectivity to the desired alkene product.

The interplay between these factors determines the overall performance of the ODH process. The challenge lies in optimizing catalyst composition and reaction conditions to maximize propene yield while minimizing undesired combustion reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

1. 催化剂：研究主要关注ZrO2负载的MoOx催化剂，以及体相MoO3和ZrMo2O8。这些催化剂显示出相似的反应机理，表明它们表面的活性中心是可比较的。

2. 选择性和转化率挑战：ODH的主要挑战是在保持高转化率的同时，实现对目标烯烃（在本例中为丙烯）的高选择性。不需要的副产品（COx）通过燃烧反应的形成与所需的脱氢途径竞争。

3. 反应机理：提出的机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原序列：
   a. C-H键活化：晶格氧原子参与丙烷C-H键的不可逆活化。
   b. M-烷基中间体：在催化剂表面形成烷基物种。
   c. 2H-抽取：这一步骤导致丙烯的形成和脱附。

4. 过程效率：效率受以下因素影响：
   a. 丙烯形成速率与燃烧反应速率的比较
   b. 催化剂选择性活化C-H键的能力
   c. 催化剂被O2再氧化的速率

5. 位点隔离：虽然在给出的摘录中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面可以发挥关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，可以最小化不需要的二次反应（如丙烯燃烧），从而潜在地提高对所需烯烃产物的选择性。

这些因素之间的相互作用决定了ODH过程的整体性能。挑战在于优化催化剂组成和反应条件，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的燃烧反应。
