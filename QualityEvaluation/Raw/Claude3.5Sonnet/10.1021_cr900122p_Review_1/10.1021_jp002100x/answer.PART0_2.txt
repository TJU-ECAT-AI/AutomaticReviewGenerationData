The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, which collectively influence process efficiency and selectivity. The study focuses on propane ODH over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, as well as bulk MoO3 and ZrMo2O8.

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH reactions. The research compares supported systems (MoOx/ZrO2) with bulk metal oxides (MoO3 and ZrMo2O8). Turnover rates differ significantly between these catalysts due to variations in the strength and accessibility of active MoO bonds. This highlights the importance of catalyst structure and composition in determining reactivity.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. Propene is the desired primary product, but carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts through both propane and propene combustion. This competition between desired and undesired reactions is a key issue in process efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle. The kinetically relevant step involves the dissociation of C-H bonds in propane, which is irreversible and uses lattice oxygen atoms. This step is followed by the formation of propene and reduced Mo centers, which are then reoxidized by O2 chemisorption.

Site isolation, while not explicitly discussed in the given quotes, can play a role in addressing selectivity issues. By spatially separating active sites, it can potentially limit undesired secondary reactions that lead to COx formation.

The study employs isotopic tracer methods and kinetic analysis to elucidate the reaction mechanism. This approach provides valuable insights into the elementary steps and their reversibility, which is crucial for understanding and optimizing the ODH process.

In summary, the efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and the challenge of balancing selectivity and conversion. Understanding these factors is key to developing more effective catalysts and processes for alkane activation.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，这些因素共同影响过程效率和选择性。该研究主要集中在ZrO2负载的MoOx催化剂以及块状MoO3和ZrMo2O8上的丙烷ODH反应。

催化剂在ODH反应中起着至关重要的作用。研究比较了负载系统（MoOx/ZrO2）和块状金属氧化物（MoO3和ZrMo2O8）。由于活性MoO键的强度和可及性的差异，这些催化剂的转化频率显著不同。这突出了催化剂结构和组成在决定反应活性方面的重要性。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。丙烯是所需的主要产品，但碳氧化物（COx）通过丙烷和丙烯的燃烧作为副产品形成。这种所需反应和不需要反应之间的竞争是影响过程效率的关键问题。

提出的反应机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环。动力学相关的步骤涉及丙烷中C-H键的断裂，这是不可逆的，并使用晶格氧原子。这一步骤之后是丙烯的形成和Mo中心的还原，然后通过O2化学吸附重新氧化。

虽然在给出的引用中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离可以在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用。通过在空间上分离活性位点，它可能限制导致COx形成的不需要的二次反应。

该研究采用同位素示踪方法和动力学分析来阐明反应机理。这种方法为了解基元步骤及其可逆性提供了宝贵的见解，这对于理解和优化ODH过程至关重要。

总之，ODH过程的效率受到催化剂性质、反应机理以及平衡选择性和转化率挑战之间相互作用的影响。理解这些因素是开发更有效的烷烃活化催化剂和过程的关键。
