The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, particularly propane, involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study focuses on molybdenum-based catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems like MoOx/ZrO2, MoO3/ZrO2, and ZrMo2O8/ZrO2.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The reaction network involves parallel and sequential oxidation steps, where propene is the primary desired product, but undesired carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts through propane and propene combustion. This competitive reaction pathway limits the overall efficiency of the process.

The proposed reaction mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence. Key steps include:

1. Irreversible C-H bond activation in propane using lattice oxygen atoms.
2. Formation of alkyl intermediates.
3. Desorption of alkyl species as propene.
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers.
5. Reoxidation of reduced Mo centers through irreversible O2 dissociation.

The study employs isotopic tracer techniques and kinetic analysis to elucidate these elementary steps and their reversibility. The findings suggest that C-H bond activation is irreversible and involves lattice oxygen, while OH recombination is reversible.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The structure of MoOx species on ZrO2 depends on the MoOx surface density and treatment temperature. At lower densities, two-dimensional MoOx oligomers form, while higher densities lead to MoO3 or ZrMo2O8 crystallites depending on the treatment temperature. These different structures affect the strength and accessibility of active Mo-O bonds, influencing the catalytic performance.

The process efficiency is collectively influenced by the nature of the active sites, the reversibility of elementary steps, and the competition between desired and undesired reaction pathways. Understanding these factors allows for the rational design of catalysts with improved selectivity and conversion for ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，特别是丙烷的ODH，涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。本研究主要关注基于钼的催化剂，包括体相金属氧化物和负载型系统，如MoOx/ZrO2、MoO3/ZrO2和ZrMo2O8/ZrO2。

ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。反应网络包括平行和连续的氧化步骤，其中丙烯是主要的目标产物，但不希望的碳氧化物（COx）通过丙烷和丙烯的燃烧作为副产物形成。这种竞争性反应路径限制了整个过程的总体效率。

提出的反应机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原序列。关键步骤包括：

1. 使用晶格氧原子不可逆地活化丙烷中的C-H键。
2. 形成烷基中间体。
3. 烷基物种解吸形成丙烯。
4. OH基团重组形成水和还原的Mo中心。
5. 通过不可逆的O2解离重新氧化还原的Mo中心。

该研究采用同位素示踪技术和动力学分析来阐明这些基本步骤及其可逆性。研究结果表明，C-H键的活化是不可逆的，并涉及晶格氧，而OH重组是可逆的。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。ZrO2上MoOx物种的结构取决于MoOx表面密度和处理温度。在较低的密度下，形成二维MoOx寡聚体，而在较高的密度下，根据处理温度的不同，会形成MoO3或ZrMo2O8晶体。这些不同的结构影响活性Mo-O键的强度和可及性，从而影响催化性能。

过程效率受活性位点性质、基本步骤的可逆性以及期望和非期望反应路径之间的竞争等因素的共同影响。理解这些因素可以实现ODH反应催化剂的理性设计，提高选择性和转化率。
