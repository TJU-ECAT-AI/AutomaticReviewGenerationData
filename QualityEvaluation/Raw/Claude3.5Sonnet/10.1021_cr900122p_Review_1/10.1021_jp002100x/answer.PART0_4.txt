[1] "Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify the elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts."

[2] "Normal kinetic isotopic effects (kC-H/kC-D) were measured for propane dehydrogenation (2.3), propane combustion (1.6) and propene combustion (2.1). These data indicate that the kinetically relevant steps in propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion involve the dissociation of CH bonds in the respective reactant."

[3] "These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism in which two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of CH bond in propane. The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers."

[4] "The proposed reaction mechanism leads to a complex kinetic rate expression that accurately describes the observed dependences on the partial pressure of propane, oxygen, and water."

[5] "Water inhibits the rate of propane ODH, in a manner similar to that reported previously for propane and ethane ODH over V2O5-based catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. The study focuses on propane ODH over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, but also draws comparisons with other systems like V2O5-based catalysts.

The reaction mechanism for propane ODH on MoOx catalysts follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle. This involves the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane by lattice oxygen atoms, followed by the desorption of alkyl species as propene. The remaining OH groups then recombine to form water and reduce the Mo centers, which are subsequently reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Kinetic isotope effect measurements reveal that C-H bond dissociation is the rate-determining step in both propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion. This highlights the challenge of achieving high selectivity, as the desired product (propene) can undergo further oxidation through a similar mechanism.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: The study compares MoOx/ZrO2, MoO3/ZrO2, and ZrMo2O8/ZrO2 catalysts, finding similar kinetic behavior across these systems.

2. Reaction conditions: The partial pressures of propane, oxygen, and water all affect the reaction rates. Notably, water inhibits the rate of propane ODH.

3. Selectivity challenges: The similar activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion make it difficult to achieve high selectivity towards propene.

The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is not directly addressed in the given excerpts. However, the study's focus on supported catalysts (MoOx/ZrO2) suggests that dispersing active sites on a support material may play a role in controlling reactivity and selectivity.

The complex interplay of these factors results in a kinetic rate expression that accurately describes the observed reaction behavior. This understanding of the reaction mechanism and kinetics is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and process conditions to improve selectivity and overall efficiency in alkane ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和工艺条件。该研究主要关注ZrO2负载的MoOx催化剂上的丙烷ODH，但也与其他系统如V2O5基催化剂进行了比较。

MoOx催化剂上丙烷ODH的反应机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环。这涉及到晶格氧原子对丙烷中C-H键的不可逆活化，随后烷基物种作为丙烯脱附。剩余的OH基团则重新结合形成水，并还原Mo中心，后者随后被气相氧再氧化。

动力学同位素效应测量表明，C-H键断裂是丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的速率决定步骤。这凸显了实现高选择性的挑战，因为所需产物（丙烯）可能通过类似的机制进一步氧化。

ODH过程的效率受到几个因素的影响：

1. 催化剂组成：该研究比较了MoOx/ZrO2、MoO3/ZrO2和ZrMo2O8/ZrO2催化剂，发现这些系统的动力学行为相似。

2. 反应条件：丙烷、氧气和水的分压都影响反应速率。值得注意的是，水抑制了丙烷ODH的速率。

3. 选择性挑战：丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能相似，使得难以实现对丙烯的高选择性。

给出的摘录中没有直接提到位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。然而，该研究关注负载型催化剂（MoOx/ZrO2）表明，在载体材料上分散活性位点可能在控制反应活性和选择性方面发挥作用。

这些因素的复杂相互作用导致了一个能准确描述观察到的反应行为的动力学速率表达式。对反应机理和动力学的这种理解对于优化催化剂设计和工艺条件，从而提高烷烃ODH过程的选择性和整体效率至关重要。
