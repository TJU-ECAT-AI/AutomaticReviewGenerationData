The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

1. Catalysts: The study focuses on ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, as well as bulk MoO3 and ZrMo2O8. These catalysts show similar reaction mechanisms, suggesting that the active centers on their surfaces are comparable.

2. Selectivity and conversion challenges: The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity to the desired alkene (propene in this case) while maintaining high conversion. The formation of unwanted byproducts (COx) via combustion reactions competes with the desired dehydrogenation pathway.

3. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence:
   a. C-H bond activation: Lattice oxygen atoms participate in the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane.
   b. M-alkyl intermediates: The resulting alkyl species form on the catalyst surface.
   c. 2H-abstraction: This step leads to the formation and desorption of propene.

4. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by:
   a. The rate of propene formation vs. combustion reactions
   b. The ability of the catalyst to activate C-H bonds selectively
   c. The rate of catalyst reoxidation by O2

5. Site isolation: Although not explicitly discussed in the given excerpts, site isolation can play a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, unwanted secondary reactions (like propene combustion) can be minimized, potentially improving selectivity to the desired alkene product.

The interplay between these factors determines the overall performance of the ODH process. The challenge lies in optimizing catalyst composition and reaction conditions to maximize propene yield while minimizing undesired combustion reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, aiming to achieve high selectivity and conversion. The study focuses on ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts for propane ODH.

The main challenges in ODH are achieving high selectivity while maintaining good conversion rates. The primary desired product is propene, but unwanted carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts through parallel and sequential oxidation steps. This competition between desired and undesired products is a key challenge in optimizing the process efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle. The kinetically relevant step involves the dissociation of C-H bonds in propane, which is irreversible and uses lattice oxygen atoms. This leads to the formation of alkyl intermediates, which then desorb as propene. The remaining OH groups recombine to form water and create reduced Mo centers, which are subsequently reoxidized by O2 chemisorption.

Site isolation, while not explicitly discussed in the given excerpts, can play a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, it may be possible to limit over-oxidation reactions that lead to COx formation, thus improving selectivity towards the desired propene product.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition and structure: The study compares supported MoOx, bulk MoO3, and ZrMo2O8 catalysts, finding similar active centers on their surfaces.

2. Reaction conditions: The partial pressures of propane, oxygen, and water affect the reaction rates and selectivity.

3. C-H bond activation: The irreversible nature of this step and its reliance on lattice oxygen are critical for the overall reaction mechanism.

4. Redox cycle: The balance between the reduction of Mo centers and their reoxidation by O2 is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity.

By understanding and optimizing these factors, researchers can work towards improving the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process, making it more viable for industrial applications.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, which collectively influence process efficiency and selectivity. The study focuses on propane ODH over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, as well as bulk MoO3 and ZrMo2O8.

Catalysts play a crucial role in ODH reactions. The research compares supported systems (MoOx/ZrO2) with bulk metal oxides (MoO3 and ZrMo2O8). Turnover rates differ significantly between these catalysts due to variations in the strength and accessibility of active MoO bonds. This highlights the importance of catalyst structure and composition in determining reactivity.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. Propene is the desired primary product, but carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts through both propane and propene combustion. This competition between desired and undesired reactions is a key issue in process efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle. The kinetically relevant step involves the dissociation of C-H bonds in propane, which is irreversible and uses lattice oxygen atoms. This step is followed by the formation of propene and reduced Mo centers, which are then reoxidized by O2 chemisorption.

Site isolation, while not explicitly discussed in the given quotes, can play a role in addressing selectivity issues. By spatially separating active sites, it can potentially limit undesired secondary reactions that lead to COx formation.

The study employs isotopic tracer methods and kinetic analysis to elucidate the reaction mechanism. This approach provides valuable insights into the elementary steps and their reversibility, which is crucial for understanding and optimizing the ODH process.

In summary, the efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and the challenge of balancing selectivity and conversion. Understanding these factors is key to developing more effective catalysts and processes for alkane activation.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, particularly propane, involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study focuses on molybdenum-based catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems like MoOx/ZrO2, MoO3/ZrO2, and ZrMo2O8/ZrO2.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The reaction network involves parallel and sequential oxidation steps, where propene is the primary desired product, but undesired carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts through propane and propene combustion. This competitive reaction pathway limits the overall efficiency of the process.

The proposed reaction mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox sequence. Key steps include:

1. Irreversible C-H bond activation in propane using lattice oxygen atoms.
2. Formation of alkyl intermediates.
3. Desorption of alkyl species as propene.
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers.
5. Reoxidation of reduced Mo centers through irreversible O2 dissociation.

The study employs isotopic tracer techniques and kinetic analysis to elucidate these elementary steps and their reversibility. The findings suggest that C-H bond activation is irreversible and involves lattice oxygen, while OH recombination is reversible.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The structure of MoOx species on ZrO2 depends on the MoOx surface density and treatment temperature. At lower densities, two-dimensional MoOx oligomers form, while higher densities lead to MoO3 or ZrMo2O8 crystallites depending on the treatment temperature. These different structures affect the strength and accessibility of active Mo-O bonds, influencing the catalytic performance.

The process efficiency is collectively influenced by the nature of the active sites, the reversibility of elementary steps, and the competition between desired and undesired reaction pathways. Understanding these factors allows for the rational design of catalysts with improved selectivity and conversion for ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，特别是丙烷的ODH，涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。本研究主要关注基于钼的催化剂，包括体相金属氧化物和负载型系统，如MoOx/ZrO2、MoO3/ZrO2和ZrMo2O8/ZrO2。

ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。反应网络包括平行和连续的氧化步骤，其中丙烯是主要的目标产物，但不希望的碳氧化物（COx）通过丙烷和丙烯的燃烧作为副产物形成。这种竞争性反应路径限制了整个过程的总体效率。

提出的反应机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原序列。关键步骤包括：

1. 使用晶格氧原子不可逆地活化丙烷中的C-H键。
2. 形成烷基中间体。
3. 烷基物种解吸形成丙烯。
4. OH基团重组形成水和还原的Mo中心。
5. 通过不可逆的O2解离重新氧化还原的Mo中心。

该研究采用同位素示踪技术和动力学分析来阐明这些基本步骤及其可逆性。研究结果表明，C-H键的活化是不可逆的，并涉及晶格氧，而OH重组是可逆的。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。ZrO2上MoOx物种的结构取决于MoOx表面密度和处理温度。在较低的密度下，形成二维MoOx寡聚体，而在较高的密度下，根据处理温度的不同，会形成MoO3或ZrMo2O8晶体。这些不同的结构影响活性Mo-O键的强度和可及性，从而影响催化性能。

过程效率受活性位点性质、基本步骤的可逆性以及期望和非期望反应路径之间的竞争等因素的共同影响。理解这些因素可以实现ODH反应催化剂的理性设计，提高选择性和转化率。

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. The study focuses on propane ODH over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, but also draws comparisons with other systems like V2O5-based catalysts.

The reaction mechanism for propane ODH on MoOx catalysts follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle. This involves the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane by lattice oxygen atoms, followed by the desorption of alkyl species as propene. The remaining OH groups then recombine to form water and reduce the Mo centers, which are subsequently reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Kinetic isotope effect measurements reveal that C-H bond dissociation is the rate-determining step in both propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion. This highlights the challenge of achieving high selectivity, as the desired product (propene) can undergo further oxidation through a similar mechanism.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: The study compares MoOx/ZrO2, MoO3/ZrO2, and ZrMo2O8/ZrO2 catalysts, finding similar kinetic behavior across these systems.

2. Reaction conditions: The partial pressures of propane, oxygen, and water all affect the reaction rates. Notably, water inhibits the rate of propane ODH.

3. Selectivity challenges: The similar activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion make it difficult to achieve high selectivity towards propene.

The role of site isolation in addressing selectivity issues is not directly addressed in the given excerpts. However, the study's focus on supported catalysts (MoOx/ZrO2) suggests that dispersing active sites on a support material may play a role in controlling reactivity and selectivity.

The complex interplay of these factors results in a kinetic rate expression that accurately describes the observed reaction behavior. This understanding of the reaction mechanism and kinetics is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and process conditions to improve selectivity and overall efficiency in alkane ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和工艺条件。该研究主要关注ZrO2负载的MoOx催化剂上的丙烷ODH，但也与其他系统如V2O5基催化剂进行了比较。

MoOx催化剂上丙烷ODH的反应机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环。这涉及到晶格氧原子对丙烷中C-H键的不可逆活化，随后烷基物种作为丙烯脱附。剩余的OH基团则重新结合形成水，并还原Mo中心，后者随后被气相氧再氧化。

动力学同位素效应测量表明，C-H键断裂是丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的速率决定步骤。这凸显了实现高选择性的挑战，因为所需产物（丙烯）可能通过类似的机制进一步氧化。

ODH过程的效率受到几个因素的影响：

1. 催化剂组成：该研究比较了MoOx/ZrO2、MoO3/ZrO2和ZrMo2O8/ZrO2催化剂，发现这些系统的动力学行为相似。

2. 反应条件：丙烷、氧气和水的分压都影响反应速率。值得注意的是，水抑制了丙烷ODH的速率。

3. 选择性挑战：丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能相似，使得难以实现对丙烯的高选择性。

给出的摘录中没有直接提到位点隔离在解决选择性问题中的作用。然而，该研究关注负载型催化剂（MoOx/ZrO2）表明，在载体材料上分散活性位点可能在控制反应活性和选择性方面发挥作用。

这些因素的复杂相互作用导致了一个能准确描述观察到的反应行为的动力学速率表达式。对反应机理和动力学的这种理解对于优化催化剂设计和工艺条件，从而提高烷烃ODH过程的选择性和整体效率至关重要。
