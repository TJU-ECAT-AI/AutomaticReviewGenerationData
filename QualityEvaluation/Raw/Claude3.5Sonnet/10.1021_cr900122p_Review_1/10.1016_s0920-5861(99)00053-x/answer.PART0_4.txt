[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity"

[2] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms."

[3] "The acidbase interaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide promotes the approach of the former to the active site"

[4] "The reactivity of the catalyst is also of great relevance, because it determines how fast the surface intermediates react."

[5] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation"

[6] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to be involved in the catalytic oxidation of ethane. Furthermore, several experimental evidences support the relevance of bridging oxygens for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[7] "Surface coverage alters the population ratio of (VOV)/(VO-support) bonds. This trend is not observed on silica-supported vanadia, where isolated surface vanadium oxide species are dominant up to monolayer coverage."

[8] "In general, selectivity is affected by the coordination of vanadium oxide sites since the presence of VOV bonds with increasing coverage of vanadium decreases the selectivity to ethylene, it may be due to a larger number of active sites that may attack the hydrocarbon molecule. In fact, the site isolation proves to improve selectivity"

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. Supported catalysts allow for better control of active sites and interactions with the support can modify catalytic properties. 

Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult due to the high stability of alkanes. Products tend to be more reactive than reactants under required activation conditions.

Proposed mechanisms: 
- C-H bond activation is likely the initial step
- Acid-base interactions between catalyst and hydrocarbon promote approach to active sites
- Bridging oxygens appear more relevant than terminal M=O bonds for selective oxidation
- Formation of M-alkyl intermediates and 2H-abstraction may be involved

Factors influencing efficiency:
- Nature of oxygen species (nucleophilic vs electrophilic) 
- Reducibility and acid-base properties of the catalyst
- Catalyst structure and metal-support interactions
- Reaction conditions (temperature, oxidant, etc.)

Site isolation plays a key role in improving selectivity by limiting over-oxidation. Isolated sites on silica supports or at low coverage tend to be more selective than polymeric species with M-O-M bonds.

Overall, balancing the activation of alkanes with controlled oxidation to prevent further reaction of products remains the central challenge in ODH catalyst design. Tailoring the electronic and structural properties of active sites is key to addressing selectivity issues.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多种因素之间的复杂相互作用：

催化剂：使用体相金属氧化物和负载型体系。负载型催化剂允许更好地控制活性位点，与载体的相互作用可以改变催化性能。

挑战：由于烷烃的高稳定性，很难同时实现高选择性和高转化率。在所需的活化条件下，产物往往比反应物更易反应。

提出的机理：
- C-H键活化可能是初始步骤
- 催化剂和烃类之间的酸碱相互作用促进了接近活性位点
- 桥接氧似乎比端基M=O键对选择性氧化更重要
- 可能涉及M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提

影响效率的因素：
- 氧物种的性质（亲核vs亲电）
- 催化剂的可还原性和酸碱性质
- 催化剂结构和金属-载体相互作用
- 反应条件（温度、氧化剂等）

位点隔离通过限制过度氧化在提高选择性方面起着关键作用。硅胶载体上的孤立位点或低覆盖度下的位点往往比具有M-O-M键的聚合物物种更具选择性。

总的来说，在ODH催化剂设计中，平衡烷烃的活化和控制氧化以防止产物进一步反应仍然是核心挑战。调整活性位点的电子和结构性质是解决选择性问题的关键。
