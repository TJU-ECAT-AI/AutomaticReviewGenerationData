[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity"

[2] "The presence of a support is of economic interest and such supports provide new means to tailor catalytic performance by altering the exposure of the sites and modifying their nature by interaction with the support."

[3] "The activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The acidbase interaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide promotes the approach of the former to the active site"

[4] "Selectivity is also determined by the hydrocarboncatalyst interaction, the reactivity of the catalyst, and the stability of surface hydrocarbon species."

[5] "The site isolation proves to improve selectivity"

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. Supported catalysts allow for better control of active sites and can improve selectivity.

2. Selectivity challenges: Achieving high selectivity is difficult due to the high stability of alkanes. Products may be further oxidized under the harsh conditions needed to activate alkanes.

3. Conversion challenges: High temperatures are often required for alkane activation, which can lead to undesired side reactions.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Key steps include C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The acid-base properties of the catalyst surface influence the initial interaction with alkanes.

5. Process efficiency: This is determined by the balance between selectivity and conversion. Catalysts that can activate alkanes at lower temperatures while maintaining selectivity are desirable.

6. Site isolation: This strategy improves selectivity by limiting over-oxidation of products. Supported catalysts and certain bulk oxide structures can achieve site isolation.

7. Support effects: The support material can modify the nature and exposure of active sites, influencing both activity and selectivity.

The collective influence of these factors determines the overall efficiency of the ODH process. Researchers aim to design catalysts that balance alkane activation ability with product selectivity, often through careful control of active site structure and environment.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及多个因素之间的复杂相互作用:

1. 催化剂组成:使用体相金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统。负载型催化剂可以更好地控制活性位点,提高选择性。

2. 选择性挑战:由于烷烃的高稳定性,很难实现高选择性。在激活烷烃所需的苛刻条件下,产物可能会进一步氧化。

3. 转化率挑战:烷烃活化通常需要高温,这可能导致不希望的副反应。

4. 反应机理:关键步骤包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提。催化剂表面的酸碱性质影响与烷烃的初始相互作用。

5. 过程效率:这由选择性和转化率之间的平衡决定。理想的催化剂应能在较低温度下活化烷烃,同时保持选择性。

6. 位点隔离:这种策略通过限制产物的过度氧化来提高选择性。负载型催化剂和某些体相氧化物结构可以实现位点隔离。

7. 载体效应:载体材料可以改变活性位点的性质和暴露程度,影响活性和选择性。

这些因素的综合影响决定了ODH过程的整体效率。研究人员致力于设计能够平衡烷烃活化能力和产物选择性的催化剂,通常通过对活性位点结构和环境的精确控制来实现。
