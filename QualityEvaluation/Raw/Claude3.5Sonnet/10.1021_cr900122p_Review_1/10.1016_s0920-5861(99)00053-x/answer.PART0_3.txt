[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity"

[2] "The high stability of alkanes is due to their electronic structure. The tetrahedral arrangement of CH bonds protects the carbon atoms."

[3] "The activation of the oxidant depends on its nature. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide. For non-reducible oxides, the presence of dopants provides reducible sites for their activation"

[4] "The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Some reports show that the most selective catalysts are less reducible although sometimes this trend is reversed."

[5] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation"

[6] "The presence of alkaline additives has a benecial effect for the dehydrogenation of larger hydrocarbons due to a modication on the acidbase interaction of the hydrocarbon with the catalyst, but this trend reverses for ethane"

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes faces several challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is primarily due to the high stability of alkanes, which necessitates harsh reaction conditions that can lead to over-oxidation of desired products.

Catalysts play a crucial role in addressing these challenges. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems have been studied extensively. The choice of catalyst significantly influences the process efficiency through various factors:

1. Redox properties: Reducible oxides are generally more active in ODH as they can activate molecular oxygen. However, the most selective catalysts are often less reducible, highlighting the complexity of catalyst design.

2. Oxygen species: The nature of surface oxygen species is critical. Electrophilic oxygen tends to promote non-selective oxidation, while nucleophilic oxygen favors selective oxidation.

3. Support effects: Supported catalysts often show improved performance due to better dispersion of active sites and interactions with the support material.

4. Additives: Alkaline additives can modify the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface, affecting its interaction with hydrocarbons. This effect is beneficial for larger hydrocarbons but may be detrimental for ethane.

The proposed reaction mechanisms for ODH typically involve:

1. C-H bond activation: This is often the rate-limiting step due to the strong C-H bonds in alkanes.
2. M-alkyl intermediates: Formation of metal-alkyl species as reaction intermediates.
3. 2H-abstraction: Removal of two hydrogen atoms to form the alkene product.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, the probability of over-oxidation can be reduced, as products are less likely to re-adsorb and undergo further reaction. This concept has been applied in various catalyst designs to improve selectivity.

In conclusion, the interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions significantly influences the efficiency of the ODH process. Balancing the redox properties, oxygen species, and site isolation remains a key challenge in developing highly selective and active catalysts for alkane ODH.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）在同时实现高选择性和高转化率方面面临几个挑战。这主要是由于烷烃的高稳定性，需要苛刻的反应条件，可能导致所需产物的过度氧化。

催化剂在解决这些挑战中起着关键作用。人们对体相金属氧化物和负载体系进行了广泛研究。催化剂的选择通过多种因素显著影响过程效率：

1. 氧化还原性质：可还原氧化物在ODH中通常更活跃，因为它们可以活化分子氧。然而，最具选择性的催化剂往往较难还原，突显了催化剂设计的复杂性。

2. 氧物种：表面氧物种的性质至关重要。亲电氧倾向于促进非选择性氧化，而亲核氧有利于选择性氧化。

3. 载体效应：负载型催化剂通常表现更好，因为活性位点分散更好，并与载体材料产生相互作用。

4. 添加剂：碱性添加剂可以改变催化剂表面的酸碱性质，影响其与烃类的相互作用。这种效果对较大的烃类有利，但对乙烷可能不利。

ODH的proposed反应机理通常涉及：

1. C-H键活化：由于烷烃中C-H键较强，这通常是限速步骤。
2. M-烷基中间体：形成金属-烷基物种作为反应中间体。
3. 2H-抽提：移除两个氢原子形成烯烃产物。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，可以降低过度氧化的概率，因为产物不太可能重新吸附并进一步反应。这一概念已应用于各种催化剂设计中，以提高选择性。

总之，催化剂组成、结构和反应条件之间的相互作用显著影响了ODH过程的效率。平衡氧化还原性质、氧物种和位点隔离仍然是开发高选择性和高活性烷烃ODH催化剂的关键挑战。
