[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity"

[2] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The acidbase interaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide promotes the approach of the former to the active site"

[3] "The oxidation of ethane involves activation of the organic molecule and of the oxidant. Activation of the oxidant depends on its nature. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide."

[4] "The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Some reports show that the most selective catalysts are less reducible although sometimes this trend is reversed."

[5] "Even when a direct correlation if often observed between reducibility of supported vanadium oxide species and their activity, the oxidation state of the vanadium sites under reaction conditions does not correspond with the reducibility as observed by in situ Raman and Vis UV spectroscopy under ethane oxidation conditions"

[6] "The average oxidation state of the vanadium site under reaction conditions, reects the balance in the catalytic cycle of oxidation and reduction of the sites, and this will signicantly affect the interaction with the hydrocarbon since the redox and acidbase properties are affected by the oxidation state."

[7] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation"

[8] "In fact, site isolation proves to improve selectivity"

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. Supported catalysts allow for better control of active sites and can improve selectivity. The support affects the metal-oxygen bond strength and reducibility.

Challenges in selectivity and conversion: Activating alkanes requires harsh conditions that can lead to over-oxidation of desired products. The strength of C-H bonds in alkanes makes them difficult to activate selectively.

Reaction mechanisms: Key steps include C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. The acid-base properties of the catalyst surface influence the initial C-H activation. Redox properties affect oxygen activation and lattice oxygen removal.

Factors influencing efficiency:
- Catalyst reducibility: More easily reduced catalysts are generally more active but may be less selective. 
- Oxidation state: The oxidation state under reaction conditions affects activity and selectivity.
- Nature of oxygen species: Electrophilic oxygen tends to cause over-oxidation while nucleophilic oxygen promotes selective oxidation.
- Acid-base properties: Affect the initial alkane activation and product desorption.

Site isolation plays an important role in improving selectivity by preventing over-oxidation. Isolated active sites limit the number of oxygen species that can interact with adsorbed hydrocarbons.

Overall, achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains challenging due to the inherent reactivity differences between alkanes and their oxidation products. Careful tuning of catalyst properties and reaction conditions is necessary to optimize the ODH process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多个因素之间的复杂相互作用：

催化剂：使用体相金属氧化物和负载型系统。负载型催化剂可以更好地控制活性位点，提高选择性。载体影响金属-氧键强度和可还原性。

选择性和转化率的挑战：活化烷烃需要苛刻条件，可能导致目标产物过度氧化。烷烃中C-H键的强度使其难以选择性活化。

反应机理：关键步骤包括C-H键活化、形成M-烷基中间体和2H-抽提。催化剂表面的酸碱性质影响初始C-H活化。氧化还原性质影响氧气活化和晶格氧的移除。

影响效率的因素：
- 催化剂可还原性：更易还原的催化剂通常活性更高，但选择性可能较低。
- 氧化态：反应条件下的氧化态影响活性和选择性。
- 氧物种性质：亲电氧易导致过度氧化，而亲核氧促进选择性氧化。
- 酸碱性质：影响初始烷烃活化和产物脱附。

位点隔离通过防止过度氧化在提高选择性方面发挥重要作用。隔离的活性位点限制了可与吸附烃类相互作用的氧物种数量。

总的来说，由于烷烃及其氧化产物之间固有的反应性差异，同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍然具有挑战性。需要仔细调节催化剂性质和反应条件以优化ODH过程。
