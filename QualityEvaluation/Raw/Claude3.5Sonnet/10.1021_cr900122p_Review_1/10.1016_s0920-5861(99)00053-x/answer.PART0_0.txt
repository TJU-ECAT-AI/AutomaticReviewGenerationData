[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity"

[2] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The acidbase interaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide promotes the approach of the former to the active site"

[3] "The importance of compounds resulting from the interaction of supported oxides with the support, like silicomolybdic acid on silica-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts can be excluded for ethane oxidation. Those species are not stable above ca. 570 K, breaking into surface molybdenum oxide species"

[4] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation"

[5] "Site isolation proves to improve selectivity"

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. Supported catalysts offer economic benefits and allow tailoring of catalytic performance through interactions with the support. The nature of the support and active phase significantly influences activity and selectivity.

Challenges in selectivity and conversion: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult due to the high stability of alkanes. Products formed may be readily oxidized under the harsh conditions required to activate alkanes, limiting selectivity. 

Proposed reaction mechanisms: The initial step involves C-H bond activation, which requires an affinity between the alkane and catalyst surface. Acid-base interactions promote this approach. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent 2H-abstraction are likely steps in the mechanism.

Factors influencing process efficiency:
1. Nature of the catalyst (bulk vs supported, type of active phase and support)
2. Acid-base properties of the catalyst surface
3. Redox properties of the catalyst
4. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition)
5. Nature of oxygen species (electrophilic vs nucleophilic)

Role of site isolation: Site isolation has been shown to improve selectivity in ODH reactions. This may be due to preventing over-oxidation of products by limiting their interaction with multiple active sites.

The interplay of these factors collectively determines the overall efficiency of the ODH process. Optimizing catalyst composition, support interactions, and reaction conditions is crucial for developing more effective ODH catalysts with improved selectivity and conversion.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多个因素之间的复杂相互作用：

催化剂：使用块状金属氧化物和负载型体系。负载型催化剂具有经济效益，并通过与载体的相互作用来调整催化性能。载体和活性相的性质显著影响活性和选择性。

选择性和转化率的挑战：由于烷烃的高稳定性，同时实现高选择性和高转化率很困难。在激活烷烃所需的苛刻条件下，生成的产物可能容易被氧化，从而限制了选择性。

提出的反应机理：初始步骤涉及C-H键活化，这需要烷烃与催化剂表面之间的亲和力。酸碱相互作用促进了这种接近。形成M-烷基中间体和随后的2H-抽提可能是机理中的步骤。

影响过程效率的因素：
1. 催化剂的性质（块状vs负载型，活性相和载体类型）
2. 催化剂表面的酸碱性质
3. 催化剂的氧化还原性质
4. 反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）
5. 氧物种的性质（亲电vs亲核）

位点隔离的作用：位点隔离已被证明可以提高ODH反应的选择性。这可能是由于限制产物与多个活性位点的相互作用，从而防止过度氧化。

这些因素的相互作用共同决定了ODH过程的整体效率。优化催化剂组成、载体相互作用和反应条件对于开发具有改进选择性和转化率的更有效的ODH催化剂至关重要。
