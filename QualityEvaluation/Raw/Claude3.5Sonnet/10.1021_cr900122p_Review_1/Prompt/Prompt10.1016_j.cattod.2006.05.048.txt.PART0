Abstract
We present a systematic survey of CH activation over various transition metal oxides using cluster model calculations. We find that H
abstraction pathway is feasible on most oxides. Our calculations suggest that when the M O bond possesses a high polarity such as those in
tungsten oxides, (2 + 2) becomes an alternative pathway. Trends and intrinsic factors that influence the activation modes are discussed.

1. Introduction
Lower alkanes are the main constituents of natural gas.
While abundant in nature, there are limited industrial processes
using these cheap resources owing to the relative chemical
inertness of a CH bond and the difficulty to achieve the
selective activation of a CH bond. Developing efficient
strategies for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes to value-
added chemicals or liquid fuels has far-reaching significance.
Especially, the direct conversion of methane to oxygenates such
as CH3OH and HCHO is viewed as one of the most challenging
goals in catalysis [19].
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates was often
carried out over supported transition metal oxides. Among
various catalysts employed, V2O5 [1012] and MoO3 [1,1315]
were considered to be the most active and selective catalysts,
while recent studies showed that Fe [1618] and W [19,20]
oxides are also of great promise. Moreover, McCormick et al.
[21] reported a promoted effect of Cr addition, which increases
the HCHO selectivity. However, a high temperature is generally
required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature,
the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into
unwanted carbon oxides. Therefore, in spite of great effort,
the single-pass yield of oxygenates is still quite low, usually less
than 4%, far from fulfilling the industrial requirement [7]. Thus,
the questions on how to conquer the propensity of over-
oxidation of CH3OH and/or HCHO to COx, and how to develop
an efficient catalytic system of both good activity and good
selectivity call for a detailed mechanistic understanding.
Although a number of mechanistic works concerning the
selective alkane oxidationswere reported[2230],muchremains
obscure for the molecular details of the activation mechanisms.
For instance, what is the most favorable CH bond activation
pathway over a specific metal oxide? How is the reactivity
connected with the redox and acidbase properties of the oxide
catalysts? How does the reactivity changefor metal oxidesacross
the row and down the column of the periodic table? In the
previous work, we have investigated methane [31] and propane
[32] activation on molybdenum oxide model catalyst. We found
that H abstraction by the terminal oxygen is the most feasible
reaction pathway, which can account for most of the experi-
mental observations. Here, we extend our study to vanadium,
chromium and tungsten oxides, and compare the results to those
of the molybdenum oxide, trying to explore the controlling
factors that govern the various reaction pathways.
2. Model of choice and computational methods
We choose M3O9 (M = Cr, Mo and W) and V3O6Cl3 clusters
as model catalysts (Fig. 1). This kind of M3O9 cluster models

has been successfully applied before in the study of alkanes
activation on the molybdenum oxide [3133]. Experimentally,
it is well known that the oxide cluster itself can serve as an
active oxidant in both solution and gas phase [3336], and there
are many experimental implications that 2d oligomeric oxide
domains formed on the supported catalysts which represented a
good selective oxidation performance [18,3740].
We concentrated on the activation of CH bonds by terminal
oxygens [ O] and bridge oxygens [O]. We considered eight
possible mechanisms. We referred to T1 and T2 as the (2 + 2)
additions (Fig. 2), which lead to the carbide and the hydride
formation, respectively. As the valence of the metal center is not
changed during the reaction, (2 + 2) might be considered as an
acidbase reaction. T3T5 belong to a two-electron (2e)
oxidation process with the metal center being reduced formally
by two units (Fig. 3). T3 and T4 correspond to the (3 + 2) and
(5 + 2) pathways, respectively. Both of them lead to the
formation of hydroxyl and alkoxy directly. T5 is called the
oxenoid insertion, which leads directly to the formation of
alcohol. H abstraction is a 1e process (Fig. 4), which involves
radical formation with the metal center being reduced formally
by one unit. Here we considered H abstractions both by
terminal oxygens (T6 and T7) and bridge oxygens (T8).
The quantum calculations were performed using hybrid
density functional theory at the level of B3LYP [41,42]. Full
geometry optimizations and analytical frequency calculations
were performed with basis sets of double zeta quality (6-31G
[43]) for the main group elements. The final energies were
calculated with polarization functions being included (6-
31G** [44]). Hays effective core potentials (Lanl2dz [45]
denoted in Gaussian 98 [46]) were used for transition metals,
which include the relativistic effects for heavy metals. The
methodology used here was shown to lead to satisfactory
results as compared to the higher level calculations and the
related experimental data [31,32]. Energy barriers reported
here are after zero-point energy corrections and thermo
corrections to 873 K, which corresponds to the experimental
condition [7].
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 2 depicted the transition states of T1 and T2. Either T1
or T2 occurs via a four-center, four-electron cyclic structure.
Although both T1 and T2 belong to the (2 + 2) addition, we find
that T1 is significantly favored over T2 by about 30 kcal/mol.
Such a tendency may be explained by the dipole interaction. In
fact, the initial orientation of the CdHd+ bond polarity in T2 is
opposed to that of the Md+Od bond, destabilizing the
transition state [47]. Previous calculations showed that the
positive charge on the metal center increases from Cr to Mo to
W [47]. Thus, the MO bond polarity increases down the
column or to the left of the row in accordance with the periodic
trend of electronegativity. The calculated barriers for T1 are
57.0 kcal/mol (V), 50.1 kcal/mol (Mo) and 43.6 kcal/mol (W).
Although we are unable to locate a T1 state for Cr, we expect it
to be substantially higher than that of V. Thus, for T1, we

conclude the reactivity follows the trend W > Mo > V > Cr, in
parallel with the polarity of an MO bond.
Since the (2 + 2) addition eventually involves the breakage
of the M O p bond, the p bond strength is another factor that
enters the reactivity of metal oxides. Previous calculations
showed that the p bond becomes stronger for the heavier metal
[48]. Hence, a stronger M O p bond is correlated with a lower
reactivity of the metal oxide. For T2, we observe an abnormal

trend for reactivity in that W > Cr > V > Mo. This can be
rationalized
by

Geometric parameters reveal some other mechanistic details
(Fig. 2). For T1, the R3 distance (OH) decreases from W
(1.254 A
 ) to Mo (1.214 A
 ) to V (1.160 A
 ); which accompanies
the increase of the R4 distance (CH) from W (1.467 A
 ) to Mo
(1.493 A
 ) to V (1.601 A
 ). Thus, we expect that T1 state for Cr is
even late with a short OH bond and a long CH distance,
whereas an early transition state is preferred for the T1
pathway. As compared to T1, T2 would always be considered
as a late transition state in that the MH bond (1.61.8 A
 ) is
already formed and the CH bond (1.82.0 A
 ) is broken. Note
that, however, the formation of the OC bond is still at its early
stage (2.1 A
 versus 1.43 A
 of an ordinary CO single bond).
In pathways from T3 to T5 (Fig. 3), the metal centers are
reduced by two units. Thus, the reactivity should be correlated
with the trend of reducibility of metal oxides. For the singlet
electronic state of the M3O9 model, it is expected that the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is made from the M O
p* anti-bonding. Hence, a stronger M O p bond is correlated
with a higher lying LUMO, in accordant connection with a
lower reducibility of the metal oxide. We therefore expect that
the reactivity decreases down the column or to the left of the
row as the M O p bond strength increases [47].
For T4, the calculated barriers are 63.6 kcal/mol (V),
39.7 kcal/mol (Cr), 63.2 kcal/mol (Mo) and 80.2 kcal/mol (W).
Thus, the reactivity is Cr > Mo  V > W. For T3, the
calculated barriers are 42.8 kcal/mol (Cr), 68.6 kcal/mol
(Mo) and 83.8 kcal/mol (W), suggesting the same trend as
Cr > Mo > W. Note that T4 is always preferable over the
corresponding T3. This can be rationalized by the spectator oxo
effect such that the relaxation effect is more significant in T4
than that in T3 [48]. As the oxenoid insertion (T5) is proposed
to prefer for the electrophilic oxygen species, the reactivity of
T5 should also coincide with the basicity of the oxygens.
Therefore, the reactivity decreases as the oxygen in M O
becomes more negative charged with M varies down the
column or to the left of the row [47]. The calculated barriers for
T5 are 69.4 kcal/mol (V), 39.2 kcal/mol (Cr), 69.4 kcal/mol
(Mo) and 87.3 kcal/mol (W), again leading to the same trend of
Cr > Mo  V > W as in T3 and T4.
Geometrically (Fig. 3), we see that in T5, the R1 distance is
fully elongated from the M O double bond to the MO single
bond, while the OH bond (R2) is fully formed. As T5 will
eventually lead to the direct formation of alcohol, we expect the
barriers are best correlated with the R3 (CH) and R4 (CO)
distances. Indeed we see that R3 and R4 increase from Cr to Mo
to W down the column or to V to the left of the row, in good
agreement with the increased tendency of DEa.
In T3 and T4, we see that the OH bond (R4  1.0 A
 ) is
almost formed, whereas the OC formation is still at the early
stage (R2  2.0 A
 ). We findthat the calculated barrier heights are
best correlated with the breaking CH bond (R3) such that an
early transition state with a short R3 is related to a small DEa.
In line with other theoretical works [24], our pervious work
[31] suggested that (5 + 2) may become an important pathway
when there are terminal oxygens within the suitable distance.
For all the model catalysts examined here, the [ O][O ]
distance are found to vary from 3.81 to 5.36 A
 . Nevertheless,
except Cr, where T3T5 are more favorable than T1, our
present calculations reveal that all other metal oxides possess a
higher barrier regardless of the [ O][O ] distance. This
finding downplays the role of the (3 + 2) and (5 + 2) pathways
on most oxide surfaces.
T6T8 are for H abstraction (Fig. 4), which are 1e processes,
giving an MOH bond and a methyl radical. We expect that the
MOH bond strength decreases as the metal varies down the
periodic column and to the left of the periodic row, since the
penalty to open the M O p bond has to be paid upon forming
the OH bond such that the MOH bond strength anti-parallels
with the M O p bond strength. Thus, we see that the reactivity
follows the trend that Cr > V > Mo > W. It is no wonder that H
abstractions by terminal [ O] are much more favored over that
by bridge [O], as the later disturbs the MO s bond, which is
stronger than the corresponding MO p bond, upon forming the
OH bond.
Here we note that the 1e processes (T6T8) are generally
more favorable than those involving 2e oxidation of CH (T3
T5); and the anti mode (T6) is superior to the corresponding syn
mode (T7). Geometrically (Fig. 4), we may correlate the R2
(OH) and R3 (CH) distances with the barrier heights. Thus in
T6, we see that R2 decreases from 1.199 A
 (Cr) to 1.068 A
 (Mo)
to 1.058 A
 (W), while R3 increases from 1.333 A
 (Cr) to 1.578 A
(Mo) to 1.606 A
 (W). This is accompanied by DEa increased
from 20.1 kcal/mol (Cr) to 45.0 kcal/mol (Mo) to 56.8 kcal/mol
(W). Numbers for Vare in between Cr and Mo. Hence, R2 and R3
are 1.170 and 1.397 A
 with DEa being 35.5 kcal/mol.
Among the eight pathways considered here, the most
favorable pathway is anti-H abstraction (T6) by terminal oxygen
with the exception of W3O9, where (2 + 2) (T1) appears to be the
best pathway. In general, we find that H abstraction mechanism
can account for most of the experimental observations:
(1) The calculated barriers are 35.5 kcal/mol for CH4 activation
on the V oxide and 45.0 kcal/mol on the Mo oxide [31], in
good agreement with the experimental values (39.9 kcal/
mol [12] and 45.2 kcal/mol [13] for V and Mo base oxides,
respectively). We have also performed similar calculations
for H abstraction from methylene group in propane by
Mo3O9 [32] and V3O6Cl3 [49]. The predicted activation
enthalpies are 23.8 and 32.0 kcal/mol for V and Mo oxide,
in compatible with experimental values of 23.7 and
28.0 kcal/mol measured on VOx/ZrO2 and MoOx/ZrO2,
respectively [50]. The general agreement between theory
and experiment lends support to the proposal that H
abstraction is generally feasible for alkane activations.
(2) Recent EPR spectra [30] showed that when n-pentane
flowed through the tungstated zirconia catalyst, W6+ centers
were reduced to W5+ and organic radicals formed. This
experimental observation is in line with the H abstraction
pathway of a one-electron process. For methane activation
over the W3O9 model catalyst, we find that the most
favorable pathway is (2 + 2) (DEa = 43.6 kcal/mol) rather

than

(DEa = 56.8 kcal/mol).
But
when
methane is replaced by pentane [51], the same level of
calculations lead to DEa = 43.5 kcal/mol for H abstraction
as opposed to DEa = 44.4 kcal/mol for (2 + 2).
4. Conclusions
We present a comprehensive survey of different CH
activation mechanisms over various transition metal oxide
clusters by means of UB3LYP/6-31G**//UB3LYP/6-31G level
of theory. Emphasis has been laid on how a reaction pathway is
favored or disfavor as the metal center varies down the periodic
column from Cr to Mo to W or to the left of the periodic row to
V. The MO bond polarity and the M O p bond strength are
two opposing factors. While (2 + 2) of the nature of acidbase
reaction is mostly governed by the MO bond polarity such that
it is most favorable over the W oxide; the other pathways
involve the reduction of the metal center such that the Cr oxide
is the best candidate owing to its lowest the M O p bond
strength which is accompanied by the highest reducibility of the
metal center. A fairly good compliance between H abstraction
mechanism and experimental evidences supports that H
abstraction is the working mechanism for the activation of
alkanes on most high valence transition metal oxides. We also
infer that the interplay between the MO bond polarity and the
M O p bond strength may counterbalance the reactivity and
the selectivity, hence V and Mo oxides are the most active and
selective catalysts experimentally observed [1,1015].
