Abstract: Molybdenum supported on silica is a catalyst for the selective oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde 
when nitrous oxide is the oxidant and steam is present in the system. At a conversion level of 3% the combined selectivity 
to CH,OH and HCHO is 78%, with CO being the principal other product. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the reaction 
is initiated by the formation of reactive 0- 
ions which are coordinated to MeV' at the surface. The 0- 
ions are capable of 
hydrogen atom abstraction from CH4, 
and the resulting methyl radicals rapidly react with the surface to form methoxide complexes. 
The methoxide may decompose to form HCHO or it may react with water to form CH30H. In this cycle molybdenum begins 
and ends in the V oxidation state. The nonselective oxidation of methane occurs (a) when MoV'02- is formed or (b) when 
the products CH30H 
and HCHO are more fully oxidized. The rate law resulting from this mechanistic scheme is consistent 
with the observation that the reaction is first order with respect to N20 
and zero order with respect to CH4. Over the range 
of H20 
partial pressures from 50 to 260 torr the conversion did not vary; however, the presence of H20 
greatly enhanced the 
selectivity of HCHO and CH30H. 
The partial oxidation of methane is one of the most challenging 
problems in heterogeneous catalysis. Although the patent liter- 
ature contains numerous references to this subject, very little 
fundamental work has been reported.'S2 Results from this lab- 
oratory have demonstrated that molybdenum supported on silica 
is an effective catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane to 
methanol and formaldehyde when nitrous oxide is present as the 
 x i d a n t ;   
however, we have not been able to reproduce the com- 
bination of selectivities and activities which were reported pre- 
viously. 
Using EPR 
spectroscopy we and others have shown that N20 
reacts with surface MoV 
ions to form 0- 
i0ns9 
which are capable 
of hydrogen atom abstraction from CHI, even at -196 O C 3 q 6  The 
resulting CH3. radicals are thought to react with molybdenum 
oxide, forming methoxide ions, and a subsequent reaction with 
water yields methanol. Formaldehyde may be formed both by 
the decomposition of methoxide and as a secondary product of 
methanol oxidation. 
In this paper kinetic data are presented to show how the selective 
oxidation mechanism fits into an overall reaction scheme. 
Moreover, in support of this selective mechanism spectroscopic 
evidence is given for the formation of methyl radicals and 
methoxide ions on the surface. 
Experimental Section 
Catalytic Experiments. The gases used in this study included CH4 
(99.99%), N20 
(99%), and CO (99.8%) having the indicated levels of 
purity. No additional purification was attempted. 
The supported molybdenum oxidecatalysts were prepared by adding 
16 g of Cab-0-Si1 M-5 silica (lot no. 1B260) to 150 mL of a solution 
which contained 0.51 g of ammonium heptamolybdate. The pH of the 
solution was adjusted to 11 by adding about 50 mL of NH40H(aq) 
prior 
to the addition of the Cab-0-Sil. The slurry was mixed in a Rotavapor 
for 2 h at 25 O
C
 and for 6 h at 80 OC. Another 50 mL of NH40H 
was 
added to the slurry, and mixing was continued while the liquid phase was 
evaporated with the aid of an aspirator (ca. 0.5 h). The partially dried 
material was heated in air at 120 O
C
 for 2 h and at 600 O
C
 for 24 h. The 
resulting catalyst, which initially 
contained 1.7% Mo by weight, normally 
was sieved to 20-40 mesh size. 
The catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor 
which was operated at a total pressure of 1 atm. The reactor consisted

of a fused quartz tube (23 mm 0.d. x 120 mm) which was connected to 
capillary quartz tubing (2 mm i.d. x 60 mm) so that the products 
CHpOH 
and HCHO could be rapidly removed from the heated zone. In 
a typical experiment the reactor contained 1 g of catalyst which occupied 
a volume of 4 mL. A bed of quartz chips 50 mm in depth was placed 
above the catalyst to preheat the reactants. 
The catalysts were further pretreated in the reactor by heating 1 h in 
vacuo at 500 O
C
 and reducing in 100 torr of CO for 30 min at 500 OC. 
After the temperature was lowered to 400 OC, the reacting gas mixture 
was introduced at a flow rate of 1.33 mL s-', and the catalyst was raised 
to the desired temperature. Helium was used as a diluent to achieve a 
total pressure of 760 torr. Water was admitted from a syringe pump 
through a preheated region. Care was taken to assure that the addition 
of water did not cause pressure fluctuations in the system. All effluent 
lines were heated to 100 O
C
 in order to prevent liquid condensation. 
A dark film formed on 
the reactor wall below the heated zone, indi- 
cating loss of molybdenum from the catalyst; therefore, a fresh catalyst 
sample was employed in each experiment. The molybdenum remaining 
on the catalyst after a reaction was 1.6% 
by weight. Since steady-state 
activity was achieved after 4 h of reaction, it is assumed that no further 
loss of molybdenum occurred after this period. 
All of the gases except HCHO were analyzed by gas chromatography. 
The column packings were Porapak Q (3 m) for the separation of CHI, 
C02, 
N20, 
C2H4, and C2H,; Carbowax 600 (4 m) for the separation of 
CH30H 
and H20; 
and a 5-A molecular sieve (1 m) for the separation 
of N2, CO, and 02. 
The Porapak Q and Carbowax 600 columns were 
operated at 80 OC; the 5-A sieve column was operated at 40 "C. The 
formaldehyde was analyzed by means of an iodometric titration. The 
effluent from the reactor could either be diverted through an in-line 
sample loop for GC analysis or through two water scrubbers for a period 
of 1 h in order to collect the formaldehyde. In some cases cold traps were 
substituted for the water scrubbers. Satisfactory precision in the analysis 
is indicated by the fact that a 90% carbon mass balance was achieved. 
Spectroscopic Experiments. Variations in the MoV 
concentrations as 
a function of N20 
and CH, partial pressures were determined at -196 
O C  
by EPR spectroscopy using a Varian E6-S spectrometer. The reactor 
for this study consisted of a fused quartz U-tube (10 mm 0.d.) with a side 
arm (4 mm 0.d.). Catalyst samples were activated as described previ- 
ously and exposed to reaction mixtures under flow conditions in the large 
part of the reactor. After a set time the gases were evacuated, the reactor 
was rapidly quenched to 0 O C ,  the gases were evacuated at 25 O
C
 to lo-) 
torr, and the catalyst was transferred to the side arm for EPR analysis. 
Experiments designed to detect surface methoxide ions by infrared and 
methyl radicals by EPR were carried out on Cab-0-Si1 silica which has 
better infrared transmission properties. The catalyst was prepared as 
previously described except that after drying the solid was calcined at 600 
O
C
 in air for 24 h, heated under vacuum at 500 O
C
 for 0.5 h, reduced 
in 100 torr of CO at 600 O
C
 for 1 h, and finally evacuated at 600 O
C
 for 
0.5 h. In the EPR experiments powdered samples were transferred to 
a quartz side arm prior to recording the spectra. EPR spectra were 
recorded at -196 OC. The g values and spin concentrations were de- 
termined by using a phosphorus doped silicon standard. In the infrared 
experiments self-supporting wafers (6-9 mg 
were treated in situ 
in a fused quartz infrared cell. Infrared spectra were recorded with a

Preparation of MoO(OCH,) As a model compound for studying the 
reaction between a molybdenum methoxide compound with water, 
MoO(OCH,) 
was prepared from MoOC1,. The latter compound was 
synthesized by refluxing MOO, 
with SOC12 
as described by Colton et a].' 
Under a nitrogen atmosphere 0.58 g of Na metal (25.2 mmol) was added 
slowly to 20 mL of anhydrous methanol over a period of 10 min. After 
the sodium was reacted to form the soluble methoxide, 1.60 g (6.28 
mmol) of MoOC1, crystals were added slowly to the solution. After the 
NaCl precipitate was filtered out, the remaining orange filtrate was 
evacuated to dryness, leaving an orange solid. 
By elemental analysis the Mo:C:H ratio of the solid was found to be 
8.9:3.8:1.0 as compared with a theoretical ratio of 8.0:4.0:1.0 for MoO- 
(OCH3)4. Attempts to obtain reasonable size crystals for X-ray dif- 
fraction were unsuccessful since the compound decomposed under vacu- 
um before it sublimed. The 'H NMR spectrum of the orange solid 
dissolved in Me2SO-d6 
had a single resonance at 6 
4.00 relative to MeSi. 
This chemical shift is characteristic of a metal methoxide group. 
Results 
Kinetic Experiments. The conversion of methane to the various 
products as a function of the pseudocontact time, W/F, is depicted 
in Figure 1. Here W is the mass of catalyst and F is the flow 
rate, evaluated at 25 OC. In this series of experiments the value 
of W/F was varied by changing the mass of catalyst and holding 
the flow rate constant. Blank experiments over silica were carried 
out at a W/F value of 1.5 s mL-', and the conversion of CHI was 
1% of that observed with the Mo/Si02 catalyst. 
It is apparent from the amounts of CH30H 
and HCHO formed 
that selectivities to these partial oxidation products were favored 
by short contact times. As the contact time increased, the se- 
lectivities, for secondary products C O  and C 0 2  
increased. Even 
at moderately high levels of conversion, for example 7.5%, CO 
is strongly favored over C 0 2  
as a product. This selectivity to CO 
may be important in a practical problem where one might want 
to use the remaining gases as a fuel after recovering the methanol 
and formaldehyde. 
The effect of temperature on methane conversion and selec- 
tivities to the several products is shown in Table I. An Arrhenius

plot of the rate of conversion of CHI vs. the reciprocal of the 
absolute temperature gave rise to an activation energy of 42 f 
2 kcal/mol. The conversions, which were recorded for a random 
sequence of temperatures over a period of 12 h, all fell on a straight 
line when plotted as a function of 1/T, indicating that the catalyst 
was stable with respect to time over the temperature range 
In order to determine a rate law for the reaction and to un- 
derstand the mechanism more fully the activity and product 
distributions were determined as a function of the partial pressures 
of CH4, 
N 2 0 ,  
and H20. These results are shown in Figures 2 
and 3. From a plot of the CH4 
conversion rate under differential 
conditions vs. the partial pressure of CH4 
and N 2 0  
the order of 
the reaction was determined. The rate equation may be best 
described by 
550-594 OC.

= 40-250 torr. At PN20 
< 80 torr the rate increased linearly with 
respect to PNl0 
(Figure 3), but with a distinctly smaller rate 
constant. This transition pressure also corresponds to a transition 
in selectivity: for PNz0 
< 80 torr the combined selectivity to 
HCHO and CH30H 
was approximately loo%, whereas at higher 
N 2 0  
pressures both CO and COz were detected in the reaction 
products. A similar selectivity variation is apparent in Figure 2; 
only in this case the combined selectivity approaches 100% above 
some critical partial pressure of CH4, or more correctly, a 
PCH4/PN20 
ratio of 1.2 at 580 "C. 
As pointed out previously, water vapor is essential for the 
selective formation of methanol, but the results of Figure 4 show 
that H20 
does not inhibit the rate of CHI conversion. In fact, 
at PHP 
pressures up to 50 torr H20 
enhanced the conversion. Over 
the range of partial pressure studied the conversion to methanol

increased almost linearly with respect to the partial pressure of 
H20. Small amounts of water had a strong positive influence on 
formaldehyde selectivity, but large amounts had no additional 
effect. 
In the mechanistic scheme which follows, the nonselective re- 
duction of MorV 
by CH, and oxidation by N20 
will play an 
important role. In order to determine the concentration of MoV, 
we carried out reactions at 560 "C under flow conditions in a 
mixture of CH,, N,O, and He. After the reaction had reached 
steady state at this temperature, the catalyst was rapidly quenched 
to 0 "C and the EPR spectrum of MoV 
was recorded. The con- 
centration of MoV varied with the gas composition, but at a 
maximum level it was only 0.2% of the total molybdenum present 
in the sample. The results shown in Figure 5 demonstrate that 
at N20 
or CH, pressures greater than ca. 80 torr the steady-state 
concentration of MoV 
was zero order with respect to either gas. 
Spectroscopic Experiments. Since the partial oxidation of 
methane is believed to occur via methyl radical and methoxide 
ion intermediates, an attempt was made to verify the presence 
of these species, albeit not under reaction conditions. The mo- 
lybdenum on Cab-0-Si1 was active and selective for the oxidation 
reaction. 
The methyl radicals formed on the surface of MoV/Si02 
are 
highly reactive, even at -196 "C, and therefore are difficult to

at 600 "C an EPR 
spectrum of MoV 
was observed which corresponded to 2 X 
spins g-l, Upon the introduction of 100 torr N,O at 150 "C and 
equilibration for 4 h, the spectrum of MoV almost completely 
disappeared, and a large 0-

signal diminished significantly immediately and 
slowly thereafter. Two peaks, indicated in spectrum a of Figure 
6, having the intensity ratio of ca. 3:l and separated by 22 G were 
observed on the high-field side of the 0- 
spectrum. These peaks 
are consistent with the high-field components of the CH3. spec- 
trum. The low-field components are masked by the 0- 
spectrum. 
As previously reported by Lipatkina et a1.,6 methyl radicals also 
may be generated by UV irradiation of MoV'/Si02 
in the presence 
of CH+ Similarly, irradiation in the presence of H2 
leads to the 
formation of surface hydrogen atoms8 The methyl radicals are 
believed to be formed by the reactions

observed since there is no interfering 0- 
spectrum. It should be 
noted that the concentration of the observed methyl radicals is 
substantially less than the concentration of MoV 
on the surface. 
Moreover, the observed CH3- 
radicals are separated by a distance 
of more than 10 8, from the paramagnetic MoV 
centers. This 
suggests that of the total number of CH3. radicals formed by 
reaction 3 only a fraction diffuse to the silica where they survive 
other reactions. 
Evidence for the formation of methoxide ions was obtained by 
using infrared spectroscopy. The catalyst wafer was reduced in 
CO and exposed to N 2 0  
after which the gas phase was evacuated 
briefly. Methane was added at 25 OC, the sample was allowed 
to stand for 30 min, and excess CH, was removed. The spectrum 
(Figure 7b) exhibited two sharp peaks at 2928 and 2857 cm-' with 
a shoulder at 2959 cm-'. These peaks remained unchanged upon 
heating the catalyst at 300 OC for 30 min, but they were greatly 
diminished in intensity when the sample was treated with 50 torr 
of H20 at 300 OC and heated under vacuum. N o  peaks in this 
region, above background (Figure 7a), were observed before the 
addition of CHI on 
the N20-treated sample or upon 
addition of 
CHI to the reduced catalyst before exposure to N20. 
A reduced Mo/Cab-0-Si1 wafer was exposed to about 0.1 torr 
of C H 3 0 H  at 25 OC, and the excess gas phase was evacuated. 
The three peaks shown in Figure 7c were observed at 2958,2935, 
and 2858 cm-'. Depending on the phase, the infrared spectrum 
of methanol consists of a very strong band in the region 2973-2934 
cm-' due to the CH3 
asymmetric stretching mode and a band in 
the region 2944-2821 cm-' due to the CH3 
symmetric  t r e t c h .   
The CO stretching mode appears in the 1034-1029-cm-' region. 
In the catalyst samples there was no 
transmission in the region 
around 1030 cm-'. 
These results provide evidence that methoxide ions are formed 
when CHI reacts with 0- 
ions on 
the surface of the catalyst. The 
differences in the infrared spectra of methoxide ion formed from 
CH, and from C H 3 0 H  
may be understood if one accepts that 
CHI largely results in the formation of molybdenum methoxide, 
whereas CH30H 
leads to the formation of methoxide ions mainly 
on 
the silica. 
Reaction of MoO(OCH). 
Although the reactions of alkoxide 
ions with water are well-known, we could not find an example 
in the literature where the reaction MoO(OCH3), had been 
studied. When small amounts of water were added to MoO(0- 
CH3)4 
dissolved in Me2SO-d6, 
the resonance at S 
4.00 decreased 
in intensity, and a new resonance appeared at S 3.33 which is 
characteristic of CH30H. Moreover, upon the addition of 45 mL 
of water to the 1.80 g (7.37 mmol) of the orange M O O ( O C H  )   
solid, the solid turned blue and the liquid phase, after distillation, 
was found to contain 22 mmol of CH30H. Thus, the facile 
reaction of molybdenum methoxide with water to form methanol 
was established. 
Discussion 
The oxidation of methane may be understood in terms of 
nonselective redox reactions and a selective reaction cycle. The 
nonselective reduction and oxidation may be described by the 
stoichiometric reactions

From the evaluation of relative MoV 
concentrations at steady state 
it was determined that m = 0 and n = 0. An important aspect 
of this nonselective oxidation cycle is the two-electron transfer 
to N 2 0  
which results in the formation of oxide ions, rather than 
the more reactive 0- 
species.

Here it is important to note that the reactive surface species MoV 
may be regenerated many times until the two-electron transfer 
(reaction 5 )  occurs. Every step in this cycle occurs rapidly at 600 
O C  
relative to reactions 4 and 5. 
The active site for partial oxidation is believed to be a highly 
dispersed form of molybdenum on 
silica as indicated by the ob- 
servation that at comparable conversions smaller concentrations 
of molybdenum results in a greater selectivity for methan01. 
The 
site may consist of molybdenum which is coordinated to oxygen 
ions of silica in the form 
kl 
where this particular complex represents the molybdenum species 
on the right hand side of reaction 1 
1. If this complex were further 
reduced before reaction with N20, then the situation would be 
suitable for the undesirable two-electron transfer described in 
reaction 5. Otherwise, the cycle described by reactions 7-1 1 could 
be repeated. Apparently the chain length for this cycle is long 
provided the CH4/N20 
ratio is sufficiently large and the con- 
version is small. If these conditions do not prevail, the molyb- 
denum will be oxidized to MoV1 
(reaction 5 )  and HCHO or 
C H 3 0 H  
will compete with CHI in reaction 4. 
The intermediates MoVIO-, 
CH3., and OCHq have now been 
identified on this catalyst, although not under reaction conditions. 
Moreover, reaction 10 has been verified independently, both by 
the reaction of the pure compound and the reaction of supported 
methoxide ions with water. 
Formaldehyde, which is the other selective oxidation product, 
may be formed both by the direct decomposition of methoxide 
ions and by the secondary reaction of methanol. Iron molybdates 
are known to be selective catalysts for the oxidation of methanol 
to formaldehyde, and we have demonstrated in a separate study 
that Mo/Si02 is also an effective catalyst for this reaction.'*'2

Even in this case the methoxide ion is considered to be an im-

Methyl formate, a known byproduct in the partial oxidation of 
methanol to formaldehyde, was also detected in this study. 
On the basis of this mechanism the overall rate equation for 
the conversion of methane may be derived. Making the usual 
steady-state approximation for d[Mov] 
/dt, d[O-] /dt, and d- 
[CH,.]/dt, and recognizing that [Mov] <
<
 [Moltokl 
enables one 
to obtain the rate equation for the disappearance of methane 
Since reaction 7 occurs at 25 O C  
and reaction 5 at much higher 
temperatures5

eq 14 becomes 
which is in agreement with the experimental rate equation with 
respect to the gas-phase reactants. The order of the reaction with 
respect to [Moltotal 
has not been tested; however, a simple first- 
order relationship is unlikely because of the various phases of Mo 
which might exist on the surface; i.e., the form of Mo which 
appears in eq 16 is probably a subset of the actual total amount 
of Mo. 
Conclusions 
The selective oxidation of methane to methanol and form- 
aldehyde occurs over a supported molybdenum via a catalytic cycle 
in which 0- 
is the reactive form of oxygen. This ion initiates a 
reaction sequence in which methyl radicals and then methoxide 
ions are formed. The methoxide ions may decompose directly to 
formaldehyde or they may react with water to form methanol. 
The reaction of N 2 0  
to 02- 
rather than 0- 
results in the nonse- 
lective oxidation.

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
