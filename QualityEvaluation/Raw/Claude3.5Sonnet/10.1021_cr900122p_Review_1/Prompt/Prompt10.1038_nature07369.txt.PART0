Organometallic complexes contain organic groups attached to a central 
metal through metalcarbon (MC) bonds. These complexes undergo 
a set of elementary reactions, many of which release products contain-
ing new CC or CH bonds. The linking of these reactions to generate 
catalytic processes that form CC bonds has been a recent focus of 
synthetic chemistry research. Such organometallic catalysts are now 
used to form CC bonds in commodity chemicals (cheap chemicals 
sold in bulk) and polymers that are produced on the scale of millions 
of tonnes per year. They are also used in tailor-made polymers that are 
produced in small quantities and in highly intricate pharmaceuticals 
and biologically active natural products (see page 323), which are typi-
cally produced in milligram quantities for biological testing.
The backbone of many organic compounds is composed of CC 
bonds, but the function of these molecules is often derived from the 
presence of heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, which 
are held in these molecules by Cheteroatom bonds. For example, 
pharma 
ceuticals and conductive polymers (plastics that conduct elec-
tricity) often contain amine CN bonds, and almost all natural products 
contain ether, ketone or ester CO bonds. Heterocyclic compounds in 
which CN, CO or CS bonds are present in the ring structure are 
found in all applications of chemistry. Moreover, useful intermediates 
in synthesis often contain CB or CSi bonds that are later converted 
into CC, CO or CN bonds in the final products.
Amines, alkoxides, thiolates and related reagents are common 
nucleophiles in reactions that occur without a catalyst. However, these 
reagents do not react with the weak electrophiles that are useful for 
synthesis, such as aromatic halides, and they do not react with common 
electron-rich reagents, such as alkenes. Thus, the ability to carry out 
catalytic reactions that form these Cheteroatom bonds would substan-
tially affect the synthesis of molecules with important functions. Such 
catalytic reactions would involve reactions at Mheteroatom bonds that 
resemble classic organometallic reactions at MC bonds. Compounds 
with Mheteroatom bonds that undergo these types of reaction are 
referred to here as hetero-organometallic complexes. To tap the potential 
of these compounds as intermediates in emerging catalytic processes, 
the principles that control their reactivity need to be understood, and 
these are now beginning to be delineated. 
In this review, I describe carbonheteroatom bond formation cata-
lysed by organometallic complexes and the underlying hetero-organo-
metallic chemistry. I focus on several examples: cross-coupling to form 
CN, CO and CS bonds13; CH bond functionalization to form CO 
(ref. 4), CX (where X is a halide) (refs 5, 6) and CB (ref. 7) bonds; 
and olefin oxidations8 and aminations9,10 to form CO and CN bonds 
(where olefins are compounds that contain at least one CC double 
bond, and alkenes are aliphatic olefins with the general formula CnH2n). 
In addition, the principles of metalligand bonding are used as a frame-
work to explain the differences in reactivity between organometallic 
intermediates and hetero-organometallic intermediates.
Classic processes catalysed by organometallic systems
Several classic catalytic reactions of organometallic systems have 
been used for decades. Three of these processes  cross-coupling, 
hydrogenations of olefins and metathesis of olefins (Fig. 1ac)  are 
commonly used by synthetic chemists. A fourth process  dehydro-
genation of alkanes (Fig. 1d)  has been highly sought and is being 
developed.
Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling to form CC bonds is one of the 
most frequently used catalytic processes for synthesizing medicinally 
active compounds. Examples of products prepared by this method are 
the antihypertensive drugs known as sartans11, the anti-asthma drug 
Singulair (montelukast sodium)12, products such as sunscreen12 and the 
polymers used for light-emitting diodes and for sensing the explosive 
trinitrotoluene (TNT)1316. The intermediates that form the new CC 
bond in the final product are classic organometallic species.
Hydrogenations of olefins are carried out on a large scale for the syn-
thesis of commodity chemicals and on a small scale for the synthesis of 
fine chemicals and advanced pharmaceutical intermediates. Materials 
ranging from margarine (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil)17 to the 
most structurally and stereochemically intricate natural products are 
prepared by hydrogenation, and in 2001 the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
was awarded in part for work on enantioselective hydrogenation18. 
Another classic catalytic reaction of olefins  the cleavage and 
re-formation of C=C bonds, known as olefin metathesis  occurs 
through complexes that contain M=C bonds, and the chemists behind 
Carbonheteroatom bond formation 
catalysed by organometallic complexes
John F. Hartwig1
At one time the synthetic chemists last resort, reactions catalysed by transition metals are now the preferred 
method for synthesizing many types of organic molecule. A recent success in this type of catalysis is the 
discovery of reactions that form bonds between carbon and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, 
silicon and boron) via complexes of transition metals with amides, alkoxides, thiolates, silyl groups or boryl 
groups. The development of these catalytic processes has been supported by the discovery of new elementary 
reactions that occur at metalheteroatom bonds and by the identification of factors that control these reactions. 
Together, these findings have led to new synthetic processes that are in daily use and have formed a foundation 
for the development of processes that are likely to be central to synthetic chemistry in the future.

for a recent review).
The conversion of typically unreactive CH bonds to C=C and CX 
bonds (where X is O, N, B or Si)20,21 holds promise for reducing the reli-
ance on existing functional groups. The cleavage of two CH bonds in 
an alkane to form the C=C π-bonds in alkenes (Fig. 1d) has been studied 
intensively. Such dehydrogenation has recently been used, in tandem 
with olefin metathesis, to develop a catalytic process termed alkane 
metathesis22, which cleaves and reforms the CC bonds in alkanes. 
Classic elementary reactions of organometallic complexes
Catalytic processes consist of a series of elementary, stoichiometric 
reactions. Advances in the synthesis of transition-metal complexes, the 
discovery of new elementary, stoichiometric reactions of these com-
plexes, and the development of methods to link these steps together 
into catalytic cycles have led to the development of many of the catalytic 
organometallic processes used today. Typical elementary reactions of 
organometallic complexes in such catalytic cycles include oxidative 
addition, reductive elimination, migratory insertion, β-hydrogen elimi-
nation and [2 + 2] cycloadditions23,24 (Fig. 2). Oxidative addition adds 
an organic reagent to a transition metal through insertion of the metal 
into one of the bonds of the incoming reagent. Reductive elimination 
extrudes an organic product by coupling two ligands on the metal. 
Migratory insertion leads to the incorporation of a bound, neutral 
(dative) ligand into a metalligand covalent bond, and β-elimination 
extrudes such a ligand.
These elementary reactions (and several others) have been used to 
create hundreds of catalytic processes. Cross-coupling (Fig. 2a) occurs 
by a sequence of steps initiated by the oxidative addition of an organic 
halide and finished by reductive elimination. Hydrogenation (Fig. 2b) 
often occurs by a combination of oxidative addition of the HH bond 
in dihydrogen, olefin insertion to form the first CH bond and reduc-
tive elimination to form the second CH bond. The closely related and 
industrially important addition of silanes to alkenes occurs by a similar 
sequence that is initiated by oxidative addition of an HSi bond25, and 
many reactions that lead to functionalization of CH bonds begin with 
oxidative addition of a CH bond. The metathesis of olefins occurs by a 
series of [2 + 2] and retro [2 + 2] cycloadditions (Fig. 2c).
Elementary reactions of hetero-organometallic complexes
Although the classic organometallic reactions, which form CH bonds 
and CC bonds, have been known for decades, few examples of reactions 
that form or cleave Mheteroatom bonds (shown generically in Fig. 3) 
have been recorded until fairly recently. The absence of this reaction 
chemistry hampered efforts to develop catalytic cross-couplings, addi-
tions to olefins, and CH bond functionalizations that form CN, CO or 
CS bonds. Until recently, there were no isolated transition-metal com-
plexes that underwent reductive elimination to form CN, CO and CS 
bonds in amines, ethers and sulphides26,27, and few compounds reacted 
with the NH bond in ammonia to form a monomeric product28,29. Iso-
lated complexes that inserted simple alkenes into the MN or MO 
bonds of Mamido or Malkoxo complexes were also unknown3032.
And Mimido or Moxo complexes that undergo [2 + 2] cycloadditions 
with alkenes (in which the two atoms of the M=O or M=N π-bond 
combine to make a saturated four-membered ring) were not known until 
the past decade33. The limited precedent for these processes raised the 
question of whether it was possible to develop organometallic processes 
to form amines, ethers and sulphides, or whether the metalligand com-
binations necessary to trigger this reactivity had not yet been identified. 
Recent progress clearly indicates that the latter was true.
Much of the literature on Malkoxo or Mamido complexes can be 
divided into two sets. In one set, high-valent early-transition Malkoxo 
and Mamido complexes were commonly used, but the amides and 
alkoxides were typically ancillary ligands because the MO and MN 
bonds in these complexes were too strong to display extensive reactivity. 
In the second set, methods to prepare late-transition-metalamido and 
alkoxo complexes were beginning to be developed, and the properties 
of these complexes were beginning to be explored34. These complexes, 
however, were often too unstable towards β-hydrogen elimination to 
observe reactions that would form CN or CO bonds. 
In recent years, our understanding of the reactions of Mamido, 
Malkoxo and Mthiolato complexes has changed markedly. Many 
researchers are beginning to develop synthetically valuable processes 
relying on hetero-organometallic intermediates. One current funda-
mental issue is how the differences in properties between carbon and a 
heteroatom change the course of these reactions. For example, does an

increase in the electronegativity of the atom bound to the metal increase 
or decrease the rate of addition, insertion, elimination or cycloaddition? 
How does the presence of an electron pair on the heteroatom affect the 
rates of these reactions? Does the presence of an unoccupied valence 
orbital on the heteroatom affect the rates of these reactions? The exam-
ples described here show that the set of guidelines needed to explain the 
patterns of reactivity is more complex than matching or mismatching 
hard or soft ligands with hard or soft metals35. A few such guidelines are 
presented in the context of the emerging catalytic processes that form 
Cheteroatom bonds through the reactions of hetero-organo 
metallic 
species: namely cross-coupling to form CN, CO and CS bonds; CH 
bond functionalization to form CO, CX (where X is a halide) and 
CB bonds; and olefin oxidations and aminations to form CO and 
CN bonds.
Catalysis by carbonheteroatom reductive elimination
Cross-coupling reactions to form the CN, CO and CS bonds in 
amines, ethers and sulphides (Fig. 4a) are widely used for the synthesis 
of pharmaceutical candidates, fine chemicals, polymers, components 
of organic devices and even ligands for other catalysts1,36. The CN 
coupling process evolved from an initially37 promising, but relatively 
impractical, coupling of tin amides with aryl halides in the presence 
of a palladium catalyst containing a sterically hindered, monodentate 
(bonded through a single atom) aromatic phosphine38 into a general 
process that has been made practical by several successive generations 
of catalysts. 
The initial process involving tin amides was replaced by reactions 
involving amines and a base39,40. The scope of the new process became 
broader with the use of bidentate aromatic phosphines that inhibited 
competing β-hydrogen elimination41,42, and later with the use of steri-
cally hindered alkyl monophosphines1,4348 that allowed the activation of 
less reactive haloarenes and the coupling of weaker oxygen nucleophiles. 
Recent fourth-generation catalysts containing sterically hindered alkyl 
bisphosphines further improved catalyst efficiency49,50. Overall, the 
development of these processes began to demonstrate the capability 
of late-transition-metalamido, alkoxo and thiolato complexes to 
participate productively in catalytic cycles.
The basic steps of the mechanism of the amination process are shown 
in Fig. 4b. Analogous steps lead to catalytic cycles to form ethers and 
thioethers. Like cross-coupling to form CC bonds, this process is ini-
tiated by oxidative addition of a haloarene. An arylpalladiumamido, 
alkoxo or thiolate complex is then formed from the oxidative addition 
product by reaction of an amine, alcohol, or thiol and base. The catalytic 
cycle is then completed by reductive elimination to form the CN, CO 
or CS bond in the product amine, ether or thioether.
The scope of the final reductive elimination reaction in this catalytic 
cycle was striking. Although reductive eliminations to form the CN, 
CO or CS bond in an amine, ether or thioether were unknown when 
the coupling reactions were first being developed, the broad scope of 
catalytic couplings of aryl halides with amines, alcohols and thiols now 
implies that these types of reductive elimination can occur from aryl-
palladium(ii) complexes containing a diverse set of aryl and heteroaryl 
groups, as well as a diverse set of amido, alkoxo and thiolato groups. In 
fact, with the right ancillary ligands on the metal, these reactions are 
typically faster than competing processes, such as β-hydrogen elimina-
tions, that lead to undesired side products.

Electronic effects on carbonheteroatom reductive elimination 
Although amido and alkoxo ligands have now been shown to participate 
in the type of reductive elimination reactions that alkyl ligands undergo, 
the electronic properties of amido and alkoxo ligands cause the rates and 
scope of these reactions to differ in synthetically important ways27.
The reactions51,52 in Fig. 4c show that the rate of reductive elimination 
from a series of compounds containing the same ancillary ligand is faster 
when the covalent heteroatom ligand has stronger electron-donating 
properties. Comparisons of the rates of reactions of arylamido com-
plexes and phenoxo complexes53, and the rates of reaction of alkylamido 
versus alkoxo complexes54, also show that the rate of reductive elimina-
tion from the amido complexes is faster than from complexes containing 
less electron-donating phenoxo and alkoxo ligands. But a comparison 
of the rates of these reactions to those of thiolate complexes shows that 
basicity alone does not control the rate. Complexes containing the less 
basic, but more polarizable and nucleophilic, thiolato ligand undergo 
reductive elimination much faster than do alkoxo complexes and at rates 
that are similar to, or faster than, those of the amido complexes55. 
These relative rates clearly argue against a trend in relative reactivity 
based on hardsoft matches and mismatches. The compounds contain-
ing the largest hardsoft mismatch are the least reactive. (An amidate 
ligand is harder than an amide ligand, and a phenoxide is harder than 
an arylamide.) Two possible alternative explanations could be based on 
the participation of the electron pair on the heteroatom. In one case, the 
compounds containing the most basic electron pairs would be the most 
reactive because these electron pairs weaken the metalligand bond 
through filledfilled dπpπ-orbital interactions56; in a second case, the 
reaction would occur by attack of the electron pair on the palladium-
bound aryl group, and the most nucleophilic electron pair would lead 
to the fastest rate. If either of these theories is correct, then substantially 
smaller electronic effects would be observed for analogous reactions of 
alkyl complexes because the alkyl complexes lack the basic electron pair 
on the atom bound to the metal. 
Studies on reductive elimination from related arylpalladiumalkyl 
complexes in which the alkyl groups have varied electronic properties57 
showed that the electronic effects on reductive elimination from the 
alkyl complexes were similar to those on reductive elimination from the 
amido complexes. Thus, the relative rates for reductive elimination from 
amido complexes are unlikely to result from the properties of the lone 
pair on nitrogen. Instead, the dominant electronic effect on reductive 
elimination seems to result from differences in the electronegativity of 
the atom bound to the metal58. Apparently, the more covalent and less 
ionic the Mheteroatom bond, and the more polarizable the heteroatom, 
the faster the rate of concerted reductive elimination from the inter-
mediates in the catalytic coupling to form Cheteroatom bonds59,60.
Recent studies on catalytic coupling and stoichiometric reductive elimi-
nation from platinum(iv) have shown that the metal and the reaction 
mechanism can change the electronic effects on reductive elimination. 
Reductive eliminations of alkyl aryl ethers, alkyl acetates and N-alkyl 
sulphonamides from platinum(iv) that are part of the mechanism of 
alkane functionalizations (discussed in the next section) occur by a 
non-concerted mechanism, and these reactions occur faster from com-
plexes containing ligands that can better support anionic charge at the 
heteroatom than from those whose ligands are less able to support such 
charge59,60. Reductive elimination from arylpalladium(iv) complexes 
has also been observed, but it is too soon to draw conclusions about the 
electronic effects on these reductive eliminations61. In addition, catalytic 
couplings that form CN and CO bonds in the presence of iron62,63 and 
copper64 catalysts are being developed, and future studies on the interme-
diates in these processes should show whether the electronic effects on 
reductive elimination from these transition metals are more like those on 
reductive elimination from palladium(ii) or platinum(iv). 
Catalytic CH bond functionalization 
In addition to cross-couplings that occur by reductive elimination to 
form Cheteroatom bonds, catalytic CH bond functionalizations 
that occur through this elementary reaction have been developed. Two 
classes of such reactions are shown in Figs 5 and 6. In one case (Fig. 5), 
the hydrogen in a CH bond of an arene or alkyl chain is converted to a 
halide or acetate with regioselectivity controlled by a ligating function-
ality. This chemistry draws parallels with previous functionalization of 
alkyl CH bonds catalysed by platinum complexes, originally discov-
ered by Alexander Shilov and studied intensely in recent years with the 
goal of developing selective oxidation of methane6568. In a second case 
(Fig. 6), a terminal CH bond in an alkane is functionalized by the use 
of a rhodium catalyst and boron reagents.
These processes require transition-metal complexes that can both 
cleave a CH bond and form a Cheteroatom bond. Some catalysts, 
such as ironoxo complexes, do so without formation of an intermedi-
ate containing an MC bond69. These complexes often abstract CH 
bonds and deliver the resultant hydroxo group to an alkyl radical. 
These outer-sphere reactions typically favour cleavage of the weaker

functionalizations. In the upper example, the metal catalyst binds to the 
nitrogen of the oxazoline substituent, and this binding positions the catalyst

lead to an intermediate arylpalladium(iv)iodide complex, which forms 
the aryl CI bond in the product. In the lower example, a related process

of the available CH bonds. In other cases, a transition-metal complex 
cleaves a CH bond to form an organometallic intermediate contain-
ing a metalcarbon bond. These inner-sphere processes preferentially 
lead to cleavage of primary alkyl CH bonds over weaker secondary 
alkyl CH bonds to form n-alkyl intermediates7072, and preferentially 
add even stronger aromatic CH bonds over alkyl CH bonds to form 
Maryl intermediates71. Thus, a method to couple the resultant organo-
metallic ligand to an alkoxide, amide or halide ligand would create 
methods for inner-sphere, organometallic CH bond functionaliza-
tion that complement the regioselectivity of methods based on outer-
sphere CH activation.
The reactions shown in Figs 5 and 6 demonstrate two approaches 
to CH bond functionalization by Cheteroatom bond-forming 
reductive elimination. In the first approach, the barrier to reductive 
elimination was reduced by generating high-valent intermediates. 
Although reductive eliminations to form CO and Chalogen bonds 
from palladium(ii) intermediates are slow and require particular lig-
ands54, reductive eliminations to form CO and Chalogen bonds from 
palladium(iv) could be more rapid and more general. Thus, oxidation 
of an alkylpalladium(ii) product of CH activation could generate a 
high-valent intermediate that would result in functionalization of the 
alkyl intermediate by reductive elimination to form CO or Chalogen 
bonds61,73. This approach, in combination with the incorporation of a 
functional group in the substrate that can ligate the metal, has been used 
to develop directed functionalization of both aromatic74 and aliphatic 
CH bonds4,75 (Fig. 5a). 
The mechanism of the palladium-catalysed oxidations (Fig. 5b) is 
initiated by cleavage of the CH bond by palladium(ii) complexes. This 
cleavage has been shown by several studies to occur by coordination 
of the CH bond to the metal, followed by deprotonation76. Oxidation 
of the palladium(ii) intermediate then forms a palladium(iv) inter-
mediate that undergoes reductive elimination to form the Cheteroatom 
bond. Reductive elimination to form a CO bond from an isolated 
palladium(iv) complex has now been observed directly61 (Fig. 5c).
In the second approach, the functionalization of terminal alkyl CH 
bonds and sterically accessible aryl CH bonds77 was developed by 
exploiting the electronic properties of intermediates containing MB 
bonds7 (Fig. 6a). The catalytic cycle for the alkane functionalization 
(Fig. 6b) involves the reaction of rhodiumboryl intermediates with 
primary alkyl CH bonds to form organometallic intermediates that 
undergo BC bond-forming reductive elimination. Currently available 
mechanistic data imply that the CH bond cleavage and the BC bond 
formation occur with low barriers, owing to participation of the unoc-
cupied orbital on boron. 
A detailed mechanism of the CH bond cleavage step of this proc-
ess78, as deduced by calculations using density functional theory (DFT), 
is shown in Fig. 6c. These calculations imply that the hydrogen atom is 
passed from the coordinated alkane to the unoccupied p orbital at boron 
to cleave the CH bond. These modes of CH bond cleavage are new 
and result from the presence of an unoccupied p orbital on boron. The 
current computational data on this process do not address the issue of 
regioselectivity, but previous studies on the stoichiometric cleavage of 
CH bonds to form Malkyl products also selectively cleave terminal 
CH bonds, in part owing to steric effects72.
This new pathway for CH bond cleavage would not be productive 
without accompanying BC bond formation. Fortunately, this BC bond 
formation occurs with a low barrier, presumably because of a favourable 
match between the electrophilic boryl group and a nucleophilic alkyl 
group. Thus, the electronic properties of boron are intimately involved in 
both the activation and functionalization stages of this catalytic, organo-
metallic alkane functionalization.
Catalysis by olefin insertions into MO and MN bonds
Addition reactions to olefins constitute some of the most desirable, 
and when successfully developed, most used catalytic reactions in the 
chemical industry. Thus, much recent effort has been focused on reac-
tions that form Cheteroatom bonds using olefins as reagents. Several 
types of catalyst for the oxidations and oxidative aminations of olefins 
through organometallic intermediates have been shown recently to 
react through yet another set of elementary reactions of alkoxo and 
amido complexes, paralleling the reactions of alkyl complexes. These 
reactions are olefin insertions into MN and MO bonds, and cata-
lytic reactions that involve this class of elementary reaction include 
the following: palladium-catalysed oxidations of olefins to form alde-
hydes, vinyl ethers and vinyl acetates; related oxidative aminations to 
form enamides; and hydroaminations of alkenes to form alkylamines. 
Other catalysts for the hydroamination of alkenes have been shown to 
react through organometallic amido intermediates generated by [2 + 2] 
cycloadditions between imido complexes and alkenes.

INSIGHT REVIEW
Organometallic olefin oxidation and oxidative amination 
A generic scheme for palladium-catalysed olefin oxidation is shown in 
Fig. 7. Extensive mechanistic studies on this process have led research-
ers to agree on the intermediacy of hydroxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, acetoxy-
alkyl and aminoalkyl complexes (Fig. 7a). However, there has been 
a longstanding debate about the mechanism for formation of these 
intermediates79. By one mechanism (Fig. 7b), the β-functionalized 
alkyl intermediate is formed by coordination of an olefin and subse-
quent nucleophilic attack onto the coordinated olefin. By an alternative 
mechanism (Fig. 7c), the olefin coordinates and then inserts into an 
accompanying hydroxo, alkoxo, carboxylate or amidate ligand. Several 
recent experiments have shown that insertion of the olefin into an MO 
or MN bond leads to hydroxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl or aminoalkyl inter-
mediates under some of the commonly used reaction conditions.
The stereochemistry of certain oxidation products differentiates these 
two paths. External nucleophilic attack leads to an anti addition of the 
metal and the nucleophile across the C=C bond, whereas insertion leads 
to a syn addition of the two. Oxidations of internal olefins or deuterium-
labelled terminal olefins in the presence of a source of electrophilic chlorine
(such as CuCl2) would lead to different stereo 
isomeric halohydrin prod-
ucts from the two mechanisms. The identity of products from cyclic 
substrates can also reveal the mechanism of formation of the hydroxy-
alkyl, alkoxyalkyl or aminoalkyl intermediate.
These studies8084 showed that reactions conducted in the absence of 
chloride form products through a syn addition across the C=C bond, 
whereas analogous reactions conducted in the presence of chloride 
form products through an anti addition across the C=C bond. Most 
probably, at high concentrations of added chloride, coordination of 
chloride occurs and discourages the generation of a hydroxo or alkoxo 
ligand positioned cis to the olefin, whereas in the absence of chloride, 
hydroxo or alkoxo ligands are generated cis to the olefin, and subsequent 
migratory insertion occurs. Recent related experiments on the oxidative
amination of olefins provide similar stereochemical evidence for migra-
tory insertion of an olefin into a palladium amidate bond9.
Hydroaminations of olefins through metalamido complexes
Some of the catalysts for olefin hydroamination have also been shown to 
occur by insertion of an olefin into an Mamide linkage. Complexes that 
contain two substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands on lanthanide metals 
were some of the first catalysts for intramolecular hydroaminations of 
alkenes to form nitrogen heterocycles that occurred with substantial 
turnover numbers85. These reactions have been recently extended to 
the formation of long-chain amines by the combination of ethylene 
and a dialkylamine86. The initial work has led to a family of lanthanide 
complexes that catalyse intramolecular alkene hydroamination8789. 
The discovery of these lanthanide-catalysed hydroaminations dispelled 
the idea that MN bonds involving high-valent electrophilic metals are 
too strong to undergo processes that would parallel the reactions of high-
valent organometallic complexes, such as olefin insertion. Measurements 
of lanthanideamide and lanthanidealkyl bond strengths led to the pre-
diction that insertions of alkenes into lanthanideamide bonds would be 
close to thermoneutral90, and Tobin Marks first showed that lanthanide-
catalysed hydroaminations of aminoalkenes occur by intramolecular 
insertion of olefins into lanthanide amides91 (Fig. 8a). The catalytic reac-
tions occur over the course of hours at room temperature by rate-limiting 
insertion of the olefin into the lanthanideamide bond. 
An alternative approach to the hydroamination of CC multiple 
bonds exploits the ability of zirconium(iv) and titanium(iv) complexes 
containing MN multiple bonds (imido complexes) to undergo [2 + 2] 
cycloadditions with substrates containing CC multiple bonds92. The 
catalytic cycle for the hydroamination of alkenes by neutral titanium 
and zirconium complexes (Fig. 8b) occurs by a [2 + 2] cycloaddition 
between an alkene, alkyne or allene and an MN multiple bond to form a 
four-membered metallocycle containing one MN and one MC bond. 
This step is similar to that of the [2 + 2] cycloadditions between alkenes 
and complexes containing M=C bonds (carbene complexes) that occur 
during olefin metathesis. Protonation of the MC bond in the result-
ant metallocycle by an amine, followed by elimination of the organic 
addition product regenerates the Mimido complex and releases the 
hydroamination product. In the past few years, ancillary ligands on the 
metal centre have been identified that extend these original hydroamina-
tions of alkynes92 to the intramolecular hydroamination of aminoalkenes 
to form pyrrolidines and piperidines93,94.

REVIEW INSIGHT
to allow a comparison of the rates of insertions of alkenes into various 
Malkyl and Mamido complexes and an understanding of the factors 
that control these relative rates. These data provide qualitative com-
parisons that can be used to formulate preliminary theories about the 
effect of the non-bonded electron pair on rates of olefin insertions into 
high-valent and low-valent amido complexes.
A comparison of lanthanide-catalysed hydroamination and olefin 
polymerization reveals the relative rates of insertions of olefins into 
lanthanide-alkyl and -amide bonds. The polymerizations of alkenes by 
lanthanide catalysts involves intermolecular, rate-limiting insertions 
of ethylene into lanthanocene alkyl intermediates95, whereas alkene 
hydroaminations by lanthanide catalysts have been largely limited to 
reactions occurring by intramolecular insertions90,91. Because lantha-
nide-catalysed olefin hydroamination is slower than lanthanide-cata-
lysed olefin polymerization, the rate of olefin insertions into lanthanide 
amides seems to be slower than that of olefin insertions into lantha-
nide alkyls. This slower rate of insertion into lanthanide amides can 
be understood by the reactions requirement to break an MN bond 
that is stronger than the MC bond. The MN bond is stronger in this 
case because of a favourable match of a hard metal with a hard ligand 
and donation of the non-bonded electrons from the amido group into 
unoccupied orbitals on the metal.
If the relative rates of insertions of olefins into lanthanideamide and 
lanthanidealkyl complexes are affected by the hardness of the lantha-
nide metal and the ability of this metal to accept electron density from 
the electron pair on nitrogen, then the relative rates for insertions of 
olefins into amide and alkyl complexes of softer, more electron-rich late 
transition metals are likely to be different. Although insertions of olefins 
into cationic or electrophilic neutral palladiumalkyl and nickelalkyl 
complexes can be fast96,97, two recent studies suggest that the insertions 
of olefins into more electron-rich, late-transition-metal amides and 
alkoxides can be faster than into the analogous alkyl complexes. 
Certain catalytic amidoarylations and alkoxyarylations of olefins reveal 
the relative rates of insertion into Mamido and Maryl linkages98,99. 
These reactions occur through arylpalladium amido and arylpalladium 
alkoxo complexes, and in each case the product from insertion of the 
olefin into the Mamido or Malkoxo bond is formed. In one particu-
larly revealing experiment (Fig. 9a), the selectivity from a catalytic alkoxy-
arylation process involving a palladium centre bound by one alkoxo and 
one aryl ligand showed that insertion into the palladiumalkoxo bond 
was faster than insertion into the palladiumaryl bond99.
A second set of data (Fig. 9b) reveals the relative rates of olefin inser-
tions into discrete rhodiumalkoxo and rhodiumamido complexes31,32. 
In one study, intermolecular insertion of an olefin into a rhodiumamido 
complex forms a rhodium hydride and an enamine as the final prod-
ucts after β-hydrogen elimination from the initially formed aminoalkyl
species31. In a closely related study, intramolecular insertion of a coor-
dinated alkene into a rhodium alkoxide forms a cyclic vinyl ether after 
β-hydrogen elimination from the resultant alkoxyalkyl intermediate32. 
The corresponding rhodium methyl complex does not insert alkenes. 
Thus, the rates for insertions of olefins into these rhodium alkoxides and 
amides seem to be faster than for insertions into the analogous alkyls, and 
these early data imply that this trend applies to the reactions of many other 
late-transition-metalalkyl, alkoxo and amido complexes. These rates 
could be controlled by the electron pair of the ligand as summarized in 
Fig. 9c. First, the Mheteroatom bonds in the starting, low-valent alkoxide 
or amide would probably be destabilized, relative to the analogous alkyl 
complexes, by repulsion between the filled metal d orbital and the filled 
amide or alkoxide p orbital. Second, the Mheteroatom bond need not be 
fully cleaved during insertions into metal alkoxides and amides because 
the insertions can form metallocyclic products in which the covalent MY 
bond of the starting amido or alkoxo complex has been converted into 
an MY dative bond (where Y is NH or O). Because the MN and MO 
bonds have not been fully cleaved in this process, the barrier for inser-
tion can be envisaged to be lower than for insertion into the related alkyl 
complex. Thus, several differences in the properties of organometallic and 
hetero-organometallic complexes can make amido and alkoxo complexes 
more reactive than Malkyl complexes towards insertions of alkenes.
Conclusions
Catalytic reactions that are widely used in organic synthesis occur with 
a broad scope of substrates, a high tolerance of the reaction for aux-
iliary functional groups, high turnover numbers, fast rates, inexpen-
sive reagents and minimal side products. Although great progress has 
been made in the coupling of amines with aryl halides, the additions 
of amines to olefins, the oxidation of olefins and the functionalization 
of CH bonds, further progress is needed before all of these reactions 
will become everyday tools of the synthetic chemist.

INSIGHT REVIEW
The additions of amines to aryl halides occur with sufficient scope and 
efficiency that it is now a commonly used synthetic method in both aca-
demic and industrial settings. However, advances in the other catalytic 
reactions discussed in this review are needed for them to become a com-
mon synthetic tool. For example, coupling of aryl halides with weaker 
heteroatom nucleophiles, such as alcohols, does not yet occur with an 
acceptable scope and efficiency. Likewise, intramolecular hydroami-
nation of alkenes needs to occur with more hindered alkenes, with 
control of stereochemistry and with much lower amounts of catalyst, 
and it needs be developed into an intermolecular process. The func-
tionalization of CH bonds needs to be developed into a process that 
occurs with milder and less expensive reagents, and it needs to occur 
with much lower amounts of catalyst and additives. It is anticipated that 
an increased understanding of the factors that control the elementary 
reactions of these catalytic cycles will greatly accelerate the discovery of 
new catalysts that overcome these current limitations.
The establishment of these principles and their use in generat-
ing improved reactions will bring the field of homogeneous catalysis 
closer to a stage at which new catalysts and catalytic reactions can be 
designed. Although a framework has been established to plan synthetic 
sequences100, a similar conceptual framework to design catalysts and 
catalytic reactions is far from established. As additional reactions to form 
CC and Cheteroatom bonds are discovered and further refined, and 
as our understanding of the factors that control the rates and selectivi-
ties of these processes improves, the field of homogeneous catalysis will 
move closer to the point at which researchers can make rational choices 
about how to modify existing catalysts and can begin to design new 
catalysts for discovering the next set of dream reactions.

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
