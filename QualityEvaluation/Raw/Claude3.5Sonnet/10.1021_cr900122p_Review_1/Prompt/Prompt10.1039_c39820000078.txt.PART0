Methanol and formaldehyde were formed as major products at a moderate conversion level (I 6%) in the 
partial oxidation of methane by nitrous oxide in the presence of water over molybdenum oxide supported on 
silica. 
The partial oxidation of methane by N,O has been studied 
extensively,l principally in the gas phase. Little success has 
been achieved in obtaining methanol or formaldehyde in 
substantial amounts and the main products are CO and CO, 
even at very low conversion levels. Recent reports2 have 
demonstrated that N20 is a very effective oxidant in the 
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molyb- 
denum oxides. The 0- 
ions, formed by surface decomposition

Recently e.s.r. studies by Kazanskii and coworkers3 have 
shown that 0- reacts with methane over various supported 
metal oxides. In an attempt to understand the role of 0- in 
the partial oxidation of methane, we investigated both the 
stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with 0- and the catalytic 
oxidation of CH4 
with N20 
over molybdenum oxide supported 
on silica. 
The stoicheiornetric reaction of CH, with 0- was studied 
in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst pre- 
pared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium hepta- 
molybdate at pH = 2. The catalyst which contained 6.6 wt. 
% Mo was calcined in air fbr 16h at 500 "C, healed in 
100 Torr of 0, for 30 min at SO0 "C, heated i
n
 vucuo at SO0 'C 
and reduced in 100 Torr of CO at 500C for 30min. The 
partially reduced catalyst contained MoV 
on the surface, which 
upon exposure to N20 
gave 8- 
ions according to reaction (1).

at 25 "C 
and Inore slowly at - 
196 "C. No ncw radicals were detected ; 
however, the reaction products were followed by analysing 
the gas phase after desorption or decomposition of the surface 
species, These gas phase products were collected in a cold 
trap after heating the catalyst for 1 h increments at progres- 
sively higher temperatures. The amount of each product, as 
determined by gas chromatography, is shown in Figure 1. 
Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption 
temperatures exceeding 300 "C. 
The catalytic oxidation was followed in a continuous-flow 
reactor which was operated at 1 atm. The reactor contained 
3 g of 1.7 % Mo/SiO, in a 23 mm i.d. Vycor tube, which was 
connected to a 2 mrn i.d. tube so that the products CH,OH 
and H2C0 
could be quenched, thus reducing subsequent gas 
phase reactions. In the experiment, helium ga5 was used as 
a diluent and the flow rate was controlled at 1.33 ml/s.

Water was introduced from a syringe pump and evaporated 
in a preheater oven. Results are summarized in Table 1. 
Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of 
magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to 
CH30fI 
and H2C0 
at 16% conversion is considerably better 
than results reported in the Iiteratre. 
The 6.6 wt. :d Mo/SiO, 
catalyst gave qualitatively similar results, although selectivities 
for CH@H and HzCQ 
were less. 
As shown in Table 1, water is required to maintain the 
selectivities for CH,QW and H2C0. 
The amounts of CH,OH 
and H2C0 increased with increasing amounts of water, and 
no decrease in activity has been observed in the presence of 
water. The role of water may be twofold. Pernicone et al.' 
reported that water retards the oxidation of @H30H 
to H2CO 
by 0, over iron molybdate catalysts. The retardation effect 
by the water in the partial oxidation of CH,OH by N20 
over 
Mo/Si02 has also been observed in our labratory; 
thus, 
water may inhibit secondary reactions of both CH30H and 
H,CO. 
In addition, the stoicheiometric results demonstrate that 
the reaction between 0- 
and CH4 
on Mo/Si02 catalysts leads 
to the formation of CH30H. 
This may involve CH30- ions, 
and indeed zlkoxide ions are formed when C,-C, 
alkanes 
react with 0- ions on MgO.' The formation of methanol may 
result from the reaction of these CH,O- ions with water or 
surface protons. One cannot, however, exclude the possibility 
that at elevated temperatures hydroxyl radicals derived from 
water or Si-OH groups react with CH3- radicals to form 
CH,OW.

<questions>


Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
