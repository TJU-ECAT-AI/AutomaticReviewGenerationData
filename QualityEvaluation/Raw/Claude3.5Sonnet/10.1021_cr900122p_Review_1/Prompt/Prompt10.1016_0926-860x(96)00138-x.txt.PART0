Abstract 
The present review analyses the literature data reported on the partial oxidation of propane to 
organic compounds (acrolein, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile) over mixed metal oxides, mainly 
magnesium vanadates, vanadia bismuth molybdates and vanadia antimony. The data were 
compared to those reported on the partial oxidation of propylene over bismuth molybdate and 
antimony--tin multicomponent oxides and over cuprous simple oxide. For both reactions, we 
analyzed the involved reaction mechanisms, intermediate species, active phases and active sites. 
The role of water produced during the reaction and that of the Brinsted acid sites were shown to 
be important in the determination of the selectivity of the expected products. The main conclusion 
of our study is that a good mix of acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should 
permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products.

1. Introduction 
Until recently the main way of better utilization of light alkanes was their 
transformation into the corresponding olefins [1-7]. Thus, acrolein [8-14], 
acrylonitrile [9,12] and acrylic acid [15-17] are produced from propane in two 
step processes via propylene (Scheme 1). However, in the present economic 
circumstances, the high cost of propylene production prompted the development 
of researches on the direct transformation of propane into oxygenates through 
selective oxidation [18-33]. The success of the obtention of maleic anhydride 
directly from n-butane has encouraged these studies. In parallel, investigations 
on the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane have been undertaken

Scheme I. The chemical routes of valorization of propane. 
since this route is expected to lead to lower costs of propylene production as 
compared to the non-catalytic and non-oxidative processes [34]. 
Another reason to specifically pay attention to use propane, as now acknowl- 
edged, is that the behaviour of light alkanes (C-C 6) in catalytic partial 
oxidation reactions is different from the one to another [35-38]. For examples, 
Michalakos et al. [35] compared catalytic oxidation of ethane, propane, 2-meth- 
ylpropane, n-butane, n-pentane and cyclohexane over VPO and VMgO oxides. 
A wide range of products ranging from alkenes, dienes, anhydrides, acids and 
carbon oxides were observed [35] and the relative selectivities of alkanes and 
oxygenate products (organic compounds and carbon oxides) sensibly varied [35]. 
An explanation of these results based on the concept of site isolation and on the 
effect of the metal-oxygen bond strength (or metal reducibility) cannot be held 
for all studied alkanes, particularly for propane and ethane [35]. It seemed that 
the size and geometry of the alkane molecules play an important role in the 
reaction course. Thus, an intrinsic sensibility of each alkane to further non-selec- 
tive oxidation of the reaction intermediates or products has been suggested to 
explain the differences in selectivity in the oxidation of C 3 and C4-C 5 alkanes, 
respectively, on VPO catalysts. 
When considering the selective catalytic oxidation of propane into oxy- 
genates, two main difficulties arise. The first one is, as for the partial oxidation 
of other light alkanes, the lower reactivity of the reactant as compared to that of 
the formed products. Activation of the reactant needs operating conditions 
(temperature as high as 500C for example) which are detrimental to the stability 
of the product. Therefore, the considered reaction requires catalysts with specific 
properties: activation of propane partial oxidation and decrease or inhibition of 
the product oxidation. The second difficulty is to design suitable catalysts 
because little is known about the involved reaction mechanisms up to now 
[19-21,34,35]. 
These difficulties combined with a strong economical incentive led to rather 
pragmatic studies, notably in the case of the selective oxidation of propane to 
acrolein [19-21]. It is worthwhile to note that the published studies, though 
scarce, concern a great number of catalytic formulations, mostly mixed metal 
oxides. It is generally admitted [19-21,25-30] that a two stages process occurs

(the dehydrogenation of propane into propylene preceding the oxidation of the 
latter into the expected products). The basic idea of these formulations is that 
associating known solid phases active for the oxydehydrogenation reaction 
(ODHR) of propane and known solid phases active for the selective oxidation of 
propylene to acrolein, modified or not, catalyses the direct oxidation of propane 
to acrolein [39]. However, as it will be shown below, the direct oxidation of 
propane to acrolein is probably not the simple addition of the ODHR of propane 
to propylene and the oxidation of propylene to acrolein [19-21]. Moreover, 
some studies suggest, on the contrary, the direct oxidation of propane into 
acrolein without propylene as intermediate [22-24]. Other routes than olefins 
have also been suggested in the case of the selective oxidation of n-butane to 
maleic anhydride on V 
2 
P207 catalysts [40,41 ]. 
In the present study we analyse the available data on the direct oxidation of 
propane into propylene and oxygenates in the presence of mixed metal oxides 
based catalysts. We focus our study on the catalytic acrolein formation but we 
also examine the direct production of acrylic acid and acrylonitrile from propane 
oxidation and ammoxidation (Scheme 1). This comparison is justified since 
some catalytic systems are reported to be active for both acrolein and acryloni- 
trile production and because it leads to a discussion on the effect of water or 
ammonia on the performance of the considered catalytic systems. On the other 
hand, taking into account the nature of the catalysts used for the oxidation of 
propane and the postulated reaction mechanisms, it seemed useful to report also 
the nature of the catalysts and the postulated reaction mechanisms for the 
oxidation of propylene. In other words, we discuss in parallel the catalytic 
selective oxidation of propane and propylene as a whole, emphasizing on the 
involved reaction mechanisms. Besides, as a preliminary discussion, we recall 
the main chemical paths involved in the gas phase partial oxidation of propane 
and some related thermodynamic data. The thermodynamic calculations were 
performed in order to compare feasible and competitive gas phase routes from 
propane to each possible product. Obviously, as the hydrocarbon oxidation 
reaction is a thermodynamically favorable process, surface kinetics determine 
the selectivity of the products. So the present thermodynamic calculations served 
as a guideline for mechanistic proposals. 
2. Products from the partial oxidation of propane and propylene 
Contrary to the catalysts used for the partial oxidation of propylene [8-14], 
those used for the partial oxidation of propane are still not highly selective 
[19-30] and a great number of products are observed: 
propylene as a product of the ODHR; 
• acrolein, propanal, acetone as products of selective oxidation reactions. 
Acrylic and propanoic acid are also detected;

breaking of C-C bonds; 
methane and ethylene as products of cracking reactions;

The theoretical reaction sequences involved in the gas phase formation of the 
above oxygenate products are described in Scheme 2. The corresponding 
standard enthalpies of reaction -- calculated from the standard enthalpies of 
formation of the products [42] -- are reported in Fig. 1. 
2.1. Propylene formation from propane 
Propylene can be formed from the direct oxidation of propane. A two step 
process through the 2-propanol intermediate (Scheme 2) can also be envisaged. 
The latter route -- unless kinetic inhibition -- cannot be excluded since its first 
step (formation of the 2-propanol) is more thermodynamically favorable (A H  
=-174.1 
kJ mol -l) than the direct route: propanepropylene (AH = 
-117.1 kJ mol-1). 
2.2. Acrolein formation 
Acrolein is formed from propylene in a two steps process (Scheme 2) through 
the allylic alcohol intermediate. The second step is more exothermic (AH =

- 195.5 kJ mo1-1) than the first one (AH  = - 104 kJ mol-1), probably due to 
the stabilization energy of the conjugated electronic system of acrolein. 
As for acrolein formation from propane, it formally consists of the insertion 
of an oxygen atom into a C-H bond and the dehydrogenation of a C-C and a 
C-O bond. The order of occurrence of the corresponding steps depends on the 
postulated reaction mechanisms. In the mechanism involving propylene as 
intermediate the order is: (i) dehydrogenation in order to transform a saturated 
C-C bond into an unsaturated C=C bond (ii) then insertion of an oxygen atom 
into a C-H bond to produce the allylic alcohol and (iii) finally dehydrogenation 
6 
M.M. Bettahar et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
of the formed C-O bond to produce acrolein. However, another order may exist 
and involves 1-propanol as intermediate. The two routes are illustrated in 
Scheme 2 and the corresponding standard reaction enthalpies (calculated at 
25C) are reported in Fig. 1. 
It appears from the data reported in Fig. 1 that, whatever the pathway, the 
standard reaction enthalpy of the first step ( - 117.1 kJ mol-  and - 150.4 kJ 
mol- for propylene and 1-propanol formation, respectively) is lower than that 
of the following steps (-300.0 kJ tool-1 and -306.7 kJ mol- for acrolein 
formation from propylene and 1-propanol, respectively). These thermodynamic 
data imply that the first step needs a higher reaction temperature than the second 
step in good accordance with the difference of reactivity between propylene and 
propane as evoked in the introduction part. In the same way, the reaction 
temperature needed should be lower for 1-propanol formation (A H  = - 150.4 
kJ mol i) than for propylene formation (A H  = - 117.1 kJ mol- 1). 
2.3. Formation of acetone and acetic acid 
The partial oxidation of propane to acrolein is often accompanied by acetone 
[23] or acetic acid formation [24,26]. The accepted mechanism [26] implies that 
acetic acid is a product of a consecutive oxidation reaction of acetone and that 
acetone stems from propylene via 2-propanol formation (Scheme 2). However, 
as for acrolein production, the direct production of acetone from propane 
through 2-propanol cannot be ruled out (Scheme 2). Thermodynamics are also 
favourable in this case (Fig. 1) since the standard reaction enthalpy of 2-pro- 
panol formation is higher ( - 174.1 kJ mol I 
) than that of propylene ( - 117.1 kJ 
mol- '). 
If we consider the thermodynamic data (Fig. 1) as well as the reaction 
pathways (Scheme 2) for both acrolein and acetone (acetic acid) formation, the 
selectivities should depend on the competition between several routes: the 
oxyhydration of propylene into 1-propanol or 2-propanol, the allylic oxidation of 
propylene and the direct oxidation of propane. The real selectivities should 
depend on the kinetics of the reactions and on the nature of the catalyst used as 
it shall be discussed below. 
2.4. Formation of acetaldehyde, methanol and formaldehyde 
Acetaldehyde formation is observed during the partial oxidation of propylene 
[7,43]. The partial oxidation of propane also gives rise to the concomitant 
formation of acetaldehyde, methanol and formaldehyde [22]. In this case, the 
main source of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde should be propylene as interme- 
diate through the oxidative breaking of its C=C bond: 
CH3CH=CH 2 + 0 2  CH3CHO + CH20 
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48

As for methanol, it should be produced from formaldehyde through the 
Cannizzaro reaction [44]: 
(H 2 
O) 
2CH20 + 1/202 --+ CH3OH + CO 2 
Acetaldehyde should also stem from propanal oxidation and, in turn, should 
be oxidized to acetic acid: 
CH3CH2CHO + 3/202 --+ CH3CHO + CO 
2 -- H20 
(H 2 
O) 
CH3CHO+ 1/202  
CH3COOH 
The thermodynamic data of the above reactions strongly depend on the 
envisaged mechanisms and the reactivity of the system is difficult to predict. 
However, it has been reported that C2-O and C1-O products arising from the 
catalytic partial oxidation of propane are stable at rather low temperatures 
( < 400C) [22,27]. 
3. Selective oxidation of propylene 
3.1. Formation of acrolein 
The industrial catalytic formulations for propylene oxidation (ammoxidation) 
to acrolein (acrylonitrile) are based on multicomponent metal oxides containing 
mainly Bi-Mo(W)-O phases modified by various metal elements such as Fe, 
Co, Ni (Table 1). The conversions and selectivities are high (87-98% and 
90-97%, respectively) and obtained in the temperature range of 250-450C. 
This system has been recently reviewed by Morooka and Ueda [48]. Several 
investigations have been carried out on mixed oxides based on molybdenum 
[49-55] or antimony [10,56,57] or on the Cu20 simple oxide [8,14]. We sum up 
the main results as following.

3.1.1. BiMoO catalysts 
BiMoO catalysts are generally prepared by the coprecipitation method [49- 
55,58]. They consist of different phases interacting in a more or less complex 
manner [48]. The addition of divalent metal molybdate improves both the 
activity and the selectivity by interactivity with the basic molybdate leading to 
the so-called synergy effect, the nature of which is still discussed [59,60]. The 
synergy effect between M H molybdate and the bismuth molybdate, reported by 
Moro-oka et al. [61], was attributed to support effect. Another type of synergy 
effect was evidenced by Vedrine et al. [62,63] in the case of FeCoBiMoO 
catalysts obtained by mechanical mixing of BizMo3Ol2 and Fel_xCOxMOO4 
phases. This effect was mainly attributed to morphological changes of the 
sample mixture during the reaction course and shown by using several physical 
techniques (ESR, XPS, EDEX-STEM, TEM, XRD and MSssbauer and UV 
spectroscopy): small mixed Fe and Co molybdate particles were found to be 
deposited on the large Bi molybdate particles and, moreover, the spreading of 
the latter on the former [63]. The Fe I .COxMOO 
4 particles are supposed to play 
the role of a fast electron conducting material which enhances the mobility and 
the efficiency of the redox mechanism [64]. The active and selective phase was 
believed to be the overlaying bismuth molybdate compounds [63]. No new phase 
was detected during the experiments [63]. 
Several studies also showed that the lattice oxygen anions were involved in 
the oxidation process [51-53,65-67]. The mobility of these ions was mainly 
demonstrated by 180 2 [61-65] and 2D tracers techniques [65] and Raman and IR 
spectroscopy [67]. It is interesting to note that, when the catalysts are promoted 
by M H cations, the degree of participation of the considered ions to the reaction 
depends on the cation radius [11]. Thus, for M  cations of radius lower than that 
of the Bi H cation (Ni, Co, Mn for example), only the lattice oxygen atoms of the 
BiMoO groups are involved in the reaction process whereas the Mn-O groups 
serve as oxide support [11]. However, for oxides of scheelite type structure, 
when the radius of the M Ix cation is higher than that of the Bi nl cation (such as 
Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb) all the lattice oxygen atoms are involved in the reaction [11]. In 
these oxides the presence of cationic vacancies enhances the lattice oxygen 
atoms mobility and should explain the observed promoting effects [54]. 
Keulks et al. [58] investigated propylene oxidation kinetics on BiMoO and 
(Fe) Bi-Mo-O catalysts over the temperature range of 325 to 475C. The 
apparent activation energies and the reaction orders for both propylene and 
oxygen changed with temperature. It was found that the reaction obeyed the 
Mars and Van Krevelen type mechanism and was controlled by the reduction 
step of the catalyst at high temperature and by the reoxidation step at low 
temperature [58]. These results are in good agreement with those obtained for 
the reoxidation of BiMoO catalysts studied by TPD, XRD, Auger spectroscopy 
and kinetics of individual reduction and reoxidation steps of the same catalysts 
[68,69]. Carbon dioxide formation was also observed to not obey the redox

mechanism and probably adsorbed oxygen atoms participated to its formation 
[58]. On the other hand, the kinetic studies of Haber et al. [70] on the same 
catalytic system indicates that acrolein is formed on Bi III sites and that the slow 
reaction step is the activation of propylene. The formation of carbon oxides 
should be facilitated by Fe IH ions and occurs as a parallel reaction where the 
slow step is oxygen activation [70]. Acetaldehyde, a secondary product, is also 
formed in a parallel reaction [70]. At high temperatures the reaction is diffusion 
controlled [70]. 
The mechanistic studies show that the first step of the partial oxidation of 
propylene is the formation of a symmetric "rr-allylic species [12,68,69] (Scheme 
3). Studies where allyl radical were in situ generated [71-74] as well as labelling 
studies [8,75-77] confirmed this conclusion. These species have also been 
directly detected as radicals by in situ methods: spin-trapping technique [78], IR 
spectroscopy [79], EPR matrix isolation spectroscopy [73,74]. It was suggested 
that the active sites for propylene chemisorption are molybdenum dioxo groups 
bridged to bismuth-oxygen groups that bring about the rate determining a-hy- 
drogen abstraction [80]:

M.M. Bettahar et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
Moreover, it seems that under normal stoichiometric feed conditions and high 
conversions only one Mo dioxo is involved whereas two Mo dioxo groups are 
necessary under milder conditions (low feed partial pressures by inert gas 
dilution) [81]. 
The subsequent steps from the allyl radical to acrolein [7,77,80-82] can be 
summarized as a succession of redox and acid-base steps [7,80] (Scheme 3). 
The "rr-allyl anion should be first formed by proton abstraction on a basic active 
site and then oxidized to the n-r-allyl cation on a redox active site. Through a 
nucleophilic attack by a lattice O2-anion, the latter species forms the o--allylic 
species which, in turn, gives rise to acrolein by a hydride abstraction in a redox 
step. The intervention of a nv-allylic species is invoked to explain the obtention 
of 1-d 1 and 3,3-d 2 acrolein molecules from 1,1-d 2 propylene (Scheme 3) in the 
same proportions (30% and 70% respectively) as from a 1:1 mixture of 1,l-d 2 
and 3,3-d 2 allyl alcohol molecules [81]: the obtained labelled acrolein molecules 
should reflect the nucleophilic attack of the 0 2- anion on either the C I or the 
C 3 of the --allylic species to form isomeric o--allylic species whereas their 
proportions reflect the isotopic effect kH/k D during the abstraction step of a 
hydrogen atom from the o--allylic species (Scheme 3). These results suppose that 
the interconversion between w and o- species is reversible [80]. 
In this mechanistic scheme it is supposed that surface carbenium is stabilized 
more likely than the radical species [7]. However, the discussion about the 
homolytic versus heterolytic process can be removed if we consider redox and 
acid-base equilibria at the catalytic surface shown below (M = Mo or Bi):

similar to that invoked for the partial oxidation of propane to propylene (see 
Section 4.1). 
On the other hand, in analogy with the homogeneous SN 
2 mechanism [83,84], 
the direct o--bonded allylic alkoxide formation from propylene (Scheme 4) may 
also occur through the nucleophilic attack of the O 2- anion on the C=C bond 
concerted with the abstraction of a hydride ion from the CH 3 group. This 
mechanism is allowed by the electronic structure of propylene where the allylic 
C-H bond of the CH 3 group is conjugated with the w orbitals of the C=C 
bond. The same SN; mechanism should also explain the isomerization of the

3.1.2. SbSnO catalysts 
The SbSnO based catalysts prepared by the coprecipitation method have been 
shown to be also very heterogeneous since they contained several crystalline 
phases depending on the calcination temperature, the duration of heating, the 
nominal antimony content and the presence or not of metal additives [85-90]. 
Among the several phases two of them have been identified: 
- -  
the rutile type phase Sn(Sb)O 2 corresponding to a solid solution of Sb 
with SnO 2; 
-- an antimony oxide phase corresponding to 5b60]3 or ot and 13 SbO 4 
stoichiometries. 
The multiphasic nature of the catalysts is the main reason of the difficulty to 
identify the active phase(s). It has been observed that high activity and selectiv- 
ity were reached when, in one hand, both the Sn(Sb)O 2 and Sb204 phases are 
present and, in the other hand, the catalyst surface is enriched with antimony 
[87]. Many authors believe that the selectivity properties are mainly provided by 
the formation of a solid solution in which the Sb 5+ species are stabilized by the 
SnO 2 tetragonal structure [91,92]. The octahedrally coordinated Sb 5+ species 
dissolved in the SnO 2 matrix were also believed to be active sites for the allylic 
oxidation in association with Sb 4+ species for the oxygen activation [92]. 
However, the Sb 4+ ions have also been proposed as the active sites [93]. A more 
complex site was proposed for multicomponent SbSnO catalysts containing iron 
[80] composed of bridging oxygens which connect two Sb 5+ and two Sb 3+

atoms. The Sb 
3+ species are H-abstraction sites whereas the Sb 5+ species are 
associated with O-insertion sites [80]. Comparing Sb-Sn-O and Sb-Sn-Fe-O 
systems it was concluded that the active site is a redox couple SbS+/Sb 3+ in a 
specific arrangement which may be formed at the surface of the Sb-Sn-O 2 
solid solution or at the surface of a thin Sb20 4 layer deposited on the solid 
solution [87]. It has also been proposed that selective catalysts consist in an 
oriented film of Sb20 
a supported by the Sn(Sb)O 2 phase [88,94]. 
Allen et al. [13], comparing TPD and catalytic experiments over a Sb-Fe-O 
catalyst prepared by the batch method [13], showed that acrolein is formed only 
when the catalyst was in the reduced state confirming the role of lattice oxygen. 
From mechanistic studies, the irreversible formation of r allyl species from 
the allyl precursors was proposed [80,94]: 
CH 2 
:CH2-CH 3  CH 2 =CH-CH 2  CH 2 =CH-CH2-O 
rr-allyl 
o'-allyl 
CH 2 =CH-CH=O 
in contrast (reversible formation) with what was suggested for bismuth-molyb- 
date catalysts [80]. This difference between molybdate and antimony based 
catalysts has been related to terminal unsaturated Mo--O groups and to bridging 
Sb-O-Sb groups, respectively [80]: the inserted oxygen bonds should be 
weakened and, as such, more reversibly broken on unsaturated metal (Mo) than 
on saturated metal (Sb) [80]. It also seemed that the considered 7r  (r intercon- 
version was not influenced by the presence of adsorbed 0 2 as shown by studies 
of the Sb-SnO system both in the presence and the absence of 0 2 feed 
[81,95,96]. 
3.1.3. The Cu20 simple oxide 
The simple oxide Cu20 is reported to exhibit significant activity and selectiv- 
ity in the partial oxidation of propylene to acrolein [8] and has been often chosen 
as a model catalyst [14,97-102] for the determination of the involved reaction 
mechanisms. 
On Cu20 powder obtained by CuO reduction at 400C, Boreskov et al. 
[101,103] showed that propylene gives rise to reversible and irreversible ad- 
sorbed species: the former led to the partial oxidation products whereas the latter 
formed CO 2 and H20 [101]. An IR study suggests the formation of acrolein 
through the 'rr-allyl species intermediate [103]. On Cu20/MgO, the same group 
[98] observed both w- and -allyl species, the former being more stable 
(523-573 K) than the latter. The w-allyl species was assigned on the basis of 
the C=C stretch at 1510 cm J [98]. 
Labelled molecule experiments over commercial Cu20 and impregnated 
Cu/o-A1203 by Imachi et al. [99] showed the existence of a primary kinetic 
isotopic effect for the production of two different forms of acrolein from 
CH3CH=CHD, suggesting an irreversible step for w-allyl to -allyl. Choi et al. 
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
13 
[97] compared the oxidation reactions of D and 180 labelled allyl alcohol and of 
CH3-CH=CHD over supported Cu20 and concluded that the o--allyl species 
was: (i) the intermediate precursor of acrolein formation from either propylene 
or allyl alcohol; (ii) was not in equilibrium with the 7r-allyl species in the 
reaction conditions. The last result is similar to that observed with the SbSnO 
system where the q-r  
o- interconversion was found irreversible [104] and 
similarly suggests the intervention of bridged lattice oxygen atoms (Cu-O-Cu) 
for the Cu20 catalyst [97]. In contrast, Akimoto et al. [105], using 1802 as an 
oxidant, concluded that adsorbed oxygen was incorporated into acrolein, not 
lattice oxygen. 
Low surface area and unoriented Cu20 crystals have been studied in the 
propylene mild oxidation [100]. The obtained results showed that stoichiometric 
or copper rich Cu20 is the most active catalyst whereas oxygen rich Cu20 
favors CO 2 and H20. On supported copper oxides it was also shown that Cu20 
favors partial oxidation products whereas CuO favors non-selective oxidation 
[106]. 
Propylene oxidation was studied on Cu20 single crystal surfaces using XPS 
and TDS in ultra high vacuum after adsorption of propylene at 300 K and 
atmospheric pressure [14,107]. Three different Cu20 surfaces were examined: 
Cu  terminated (100) surface, oxygen terminated (100) surface and (111) 
surface with accessible copper cations and lattice oxygens. It was found that 
both selective and non-selective oxidation involved lattice oxygen atoms. In 
addition, the results indicated that the selective oxidation to acrolein was 
promoted by coordinately unsaturated surface lattice oxygen atoms but was not 
correlated to the oxygen coordination. Parallel experiments, using allyl alcohol 
and acrolein as probe molecules, showed that the propylene oxidation pathway 
proceeded through the (r-allyl species. In addition, contrasting with the above 
mentioned studies [99], the pathway: 
propylene  -allyl  o'-allyl 
was found reversible since propylene was obtained after allyl alcohol desorption 
[108]. This apparent contradiction probably came from the different operating 
conditions: reducing conditions (no oxygen cofeed) in the case of the Cu20 
single crystal experiments [14] and oxidizing conditions (oxygen cofeed) in the 
case of Cu20 powder or Cu20/cA1203 [99]: concentration of the "rr and 
o--allyl species were probably controlled by kinetics and equilibria for the latter 
and the former cases, respectively [14]. 
3.2. Formation of acrylonitrile 
Both oxidation and ammoxidation of propylene (Table 1) can be performed 
with the same catalytic systems to form acrolein and acrylonitrile, respectively 
[48,68,69,109,110]. The reaction temperature is generally higher for the ammox- 
14 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1 48 
idation than for the oxidation of propylene [48,80]. Mechanisms of both 
reactions were extensively investigated, notably on the bismuth molybdate and 
the antimony oxide based catalysts [12,72,80-96,111-114]. 
The first step of propylene oxidation is the same, irrespective of the presence 
or the absence of ammonia and corresponds to the rate determining abstraction 
of the a-methyl hydrogen to form a w-allyl intermediate. The second step is the 
o--allyl intermediate formed by nitrogen insertion: 
CH3CH=CH 3  (CH2:CH-CH2)  (CH2:CH-CH2N) 
r-allyl 
y-allyl 
CH 2 =CH-C=N 
For the molybdate catalysts, ammonia is probably adsorbed as imido species 
[80] on which propylene should be adsorbed: 
NH 3 
NH 3 
O=Mo=O  O=Mo=NH  HN=Mo=NH 
Adsorption of ammonia is irreversible at high temperature but not at low 
temperature. One ammonia molecule is adsorbed at low partial pressure of 
propylene whereas at high propylene pressure two ammonia molecules are 
adsorbed at the nitrogen insertion site per acrylonitrile formed. Labelled 
molecules experiments showed that or- and "u-allyl species interconvert re- 
versibly. The second hydrogen abstraction is the slow step in the conversion of 
the cr-nitrogen-allyl species to acrylonitrile and acrolein. However, the activa- 
tion energy for this step is higher for the o--oxygen-allyl species than for the 
o--oxygen-allyl, explaining the higher increase in selectivity with increasing 
temperature in ammoxidation. 
For the antimonate based catalysts it was proposed that the active sites are 
composed of H-abstracting Sb3+-O groups and N-inserting SbS+-O bridging 
oxygens [80]: 
0

The conversion of T-allyl to o--allyl antimonate is less reversible than the 
corresponding molybdates. On the other hand for antimonates, reduction occurs 
mostly at the surface whereas, for molybdates, bulk reduction is mostly involved 
[80]. 
3.3. Formation of acrylic acid 
The catalytic systems used for the partial oxidation of propylene to acrylic 
acid are mainly based on cobalt and nickel molybdates [115-120] and VPO 
mixed oxides [121] both modified by tellurium (Table 2). In fact, acrolein and

acrylic acid are produced competitively on these systems, depending on the 
experimental conditions, and the aim of most of the reported studies was to find 
out the catalytic centers which favour acrylic acid formation at the expense of 
acrolein formation. It appears from the literature data that these specific centers 
are those which adsorb and transform acrolein to acrylic acid, that is, oxidize the 
CHO group to the COOH group. In this connection, it has been observed that 
catalysts which oxidize o-xylene to tolualdehyde oxidize propylene to acrolein 
and those which produced phtalic anhydride from o-xylene also produced 
acrylic acid from propylene [122]. 
3.3.1. CoMoTeO catalysts 
The cobalt molybdate prepared by co-precipitation and modified by TeO 2 led 
to CoMoTeO catalysts (Co/Mo = 2/3 to 1/1) highly selective for oxidation of 
propylene to acrylic acid [118]. With a mixture: air/propylene = 30/1 at 360C, 
the mean product is acrolein (98%) at low conversion and acrylic acid (39%) at 
high conversion. 
The addition of water in the feed gas tended to decrease the activities and to 
increase the selectivity of organic products, notably that of acrylic acid. Typi- 
cally, with a mixture: air/propylene/water= 30/1/5 
selectivities of 47% 
acrylic acid and 14% acrolein are found at 98% conversion. The decrease of 
activity was attributed to competitive adsorption between water and propylene 
and the increase of selectivities was attributed to an enhancement of the 
desorption rates of the products [118]. 
The kinetic study showed that acrylic acid is almost exclusively formed from 
acrolein, the initial product [118]. In analogy with the formation of acrolein from 
propylene on molybdate based catalysts [121] and with the formation of acrylic 
acid from acrolein on cobalt molybdate catalysts [123], it was proposed that the 
successive steps of the reaction take place on Mo vI and Co 
TM sites, respectively 
[118]. The role of the Te 
TM promoter should be to avoid the reduction of Co m to 
Co(II): 
Co H 
+ Te 
TM  
Co IIl -{- Te III 
The active phase was not identified since both the a-CoMoO major phase and 
the [3-Co-Mo-O minor phase are present in the catalyst. The latter is more 
16 
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
selective when it works in its oxidized form (O2/C3H6 >> 1) [124] but it is 
believed that the slight excess of MoO 3 plays an important role with its 
octahedral Mo sites [118,124]. The addition of TeO 
2 does not provoke the 
apparition of a new phase and probably gives rise to solid solutions with the 
cobalt molybdate or with the molybdenum oxide in excess in the catalyst [125]. 
3.3.2. NiMoTeO catalysts 
There is direct oxidation of propylene to acrylic acid on Ni-Mo-Te-O 
catalysts (Mo/Ni ca. 1.1, 7% Te2MoO 7) in the presence of water [119,120]. 
Prepared by different routes, the obtained catalysts were composed of microsys- 
terns of a-NiMoO 
4 enriched with Te2MoO 7 resulting from the diffusion of this 
compound in the nickel molybdate matrix. Diffusion of Te2MoO 7 through the 
mass was favoured by the temperature and composition of the gas phase during 
the activation. The slight excess of molybdenum was also believed to favour 
controlled diffusion of the tellurium promoter. It is suggested that the oxidation 
of propylene to acrolein takes place on tellurium-rich sites whereas the subse- 
quent transformation of acrolein to acrylic acid and total oxidation occur on 
tellurium poor sites, but the mixing of the two phases seemed to enhance the 
catalytic efficiency of both. It was also observed that Te2MoO 7 accelerated the 
to [3-Ni-MoO 
4 phase transformation (at 700C on heating in air) which led 
to a less active catalyst. The reverse process (o  [3) occurred at lower 
temperature (200C in air) and seemed to account for the break down of the 
granular catalyst structure observed. 
3.3.3. VPTeO catalysts 
The vapour phase oxidation of propylene was studied over V205, V205-P205 
and V2Os-P2Os-TeO 2 catalysts in the presence of water [121]. On pure V205, 
the reaction mainly produces acetic acid and carbon oxides and small amounts 
of water. When the phosphorous content was increased the activity decreased 
whereas the selectivity to acrylic acid passed through a maximum (P/V = 
1.15-1.60) and that to acetic acid gradually decreased. At the P/V = 1.15 ratio, 
the yields of acrylic acid, acetic acid and acrolein were 25%, 10% and 0.7% 
respectively. The effect of the addition of TeO 2 to the VPO catalyst was 
complex: TeO 
2 increased the specific oxidation activity as well as the sum of 
the yields of acrylic acid and acrolein while the yield of acetic acid passed 
through a maximum at Te 
T
M
 
= 0.02-0.04. The yield of acrylic acid attained 38% 
(64% for COx) at 100% conversion in the case of VPTeO (Te/P/V = 
0.15/1.15/1) catalyst. 
Increasing the oxygen concentration in the feed gas, increased the conversion 
and the acrylic acid formation at the expense of acrolein formation but does not 
affect acetic acid formation. An increase of propylene concentration increased 
the formation of both acrolein and acetic acid at the expense of acrylic acid 
formation. As for the water content effect, it depended on the reaction condi- 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
17 
tions. At high propylene conversion (98%) the increase of water concentration 
increased acrylic acid and acetic acid selectivities at the expense of acrolein. For 
example, the selectivities of acrolein, acrylic acid and acetic acid passed from 
20%, 28% and 3% to 12%, 40% and 13% respectively at a constant level of 
conversion (98%). 
The results were explained by the competition between the allylic oxidation 
and oxyhydration [ 
126,127] of propylene to acrolein/acrylic acid and acetic acid 
respectively.

The role of phosphorous should be to increase the catalyst surface acidity 
[121] and, in the present case, the resulting effect serves to promote the allylic 
oxidation relative to the oxyhydration of propylene. No clear correlation has 
been found between the presence of TeO 
2 additive in the VPO oxide and the 
catalytic performances observed. Physical characterization of the VPTeO system 
should be useful to explain these results. 
3.4. Conclusions 
The oxidation and ammoxidation of propylene to acrolein was investigated on 
several systems, mainly BiMoO and SbSnO based mixed oxides and Cu20 
simple oxide. The industrial formulations are mainly based on BiMoO mixed 
oxide modified by iron and cobalt. The lattice oxygen atoms participate to the 
reaction process. The reactive phases are most probably Mo=O and Bi-O-Mo 
containing phases for the BiMoO catalysts, Sn(Sb)O 
2 and Sb204 phases for 
the SbSnO catalysts, and Cu  ions for the Cu20 catalysts. Ammonia is 
probably activated as metal amino (M-NH-M) or imido (M=NH) surface 
species. The rate determine step is the formation of the w-allyl species which 
transform into the o--allyl species then to acrolein or acrylonitrile. Acrylic acid 
and acrolein are obtained competitively when propylene is oxidized over 
Co(Ni)MoO and VPO mixed oxides modified by TeO 
2, notably in presence of 
water. 
4. The selective oxidation of propane 
4.1. Oxydehydrogenation (ODHR) of propane to propylene over VMgO catalysts 
Several processes of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane exist [1-7] but the 
drawbacks are in one hand the high temperature used due to the endothermicity 
of the reaction and, in the other hand, the rapid deactivation of the catalysts by 
coking. An attractive alternative is the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of 
18 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
propane which is thermodynamically more favourable in a large range of 
temperature without carbon deposition. However, this catalysis requires rela- 
tively high temperatures for the propane activation (500-550C) and, moreover, 
the total oxidation is a possible secondary reaction. Thus, the challenge for the 
ODHR of propane is the design of catalysts working at temperatures as low as 
possible and avoiding the total oxidation of the initial products. A great variety 
of catalytic systems have been studied for this reaction [3,34,128-142] such as: 
alkali molten salts [3,126], metal molybdates [130,131] or vanadates [34,134- 
142] niobium pentoxide [130]. We mainly discuss the VMgO system [134-142] 
which is reported to give the best performance (typically 60% of propane 
selectivity at 15% of propane conversion) and was subject of numerous studies. 
4.1.1. Active phases and active sites 
The nature of the active phase in this system is still discussed. According to 
Kung et al. [136,143] both magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V208) and a-pyro- 
vanadate (c-MgzV207) phases are selective in the partial oxidation of propane. 
For Volta et al. [138] only the latter phase is responsible for the high propylene 
selectivities observed whereas the former is responsible for total oxidation. It 
seems that the differences of interpretation results from the presence or not of 
potassium impurities introduced during the catalyst preparation and which may 
modify the selectivities of the considered reaction [144]. In the same way, a 
recent study of Delmon's group [141] showed that the method of preparation of 
VMgO catalysts may also modify their performances due to formation of mixed 
phases which probably interact synergetically [141]. 
The nature of the active sites of the VMgO catalysts is also still under debate 
[135,138-140,145]. According to Volta et al. [138,139] vanadium occupies 
isolated tetrahedral VO 4 sites in Mg 3V208, VO 6 octahedra linked through edges 
in a-MgV206 and V20 7 units consisting of pairs of corner-sharing VO 
4 
tetrahedra in c-MgV207. The obtained order of reactivity and selectivity for the 
phases were: c-MgzV207 > MgV206 > Mg3V208. From this result it was con- 
cluded that the active site included V-O-V bridge and short V--O bond 
simultaneously present in the V20 7 units of the cMg2V20 
7 phase [138]. The 
short V=O bond is proposed to initiate the H abstraction step whereas the 
V-O-V bridge participates in the subsequent steps where water is formed. The 
V 4+ ions generated by water desorption should be stabilized in association with 
oxygen vacancies leading to structural changes from V207 units to two edge 
sharing square based VO 3 units [138,146]. This proposal is supported by the 
easier reducibility of the corresponding pyrovanade phase [ 
139,141 ]. Due to the 
different reactivity orders obtained, Kung et al. [137] proposed the bridged 
oxygen atoms as selective sites for propylene and the terminal vanadyl species 
as responsible for total oxidation. 
It could be noted that in the case of supported vanadium oxides the obtained 
reactivity results allowed Corma et al. [140] to conclude that V-O bonds with 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
19 
vanadium in tetrahedral or octahedral coordination are responsible for selective 
oxidation to propylene whereas the presence of V-O bond near a V=O bond 
leads to more oxygenate product amounts. 
4.1.2. Surface reducibility and basicity 
A general agreement is that the reducibility of the catalyst plays an important 
role in the reaction course on the activation of propane [138,139,141,146,147]. 
In VMgO catalysts, where one V atom is replaced by one Mg atom, the 
involved lattice V-O-M 
oxygen atom is less mobile and thus the catalyst 
surface is less reducible: these catalysts led to dominant propylene selectivity 
[35,138,140]. 
The basic catalyst surface has also been claimed [143,147-149] to increase 
the alkene selectivity during the ODHR of alkanes. Thus, on supported vana- 
dium or molybdenum oxides, it was shown that incorporating alkaline metals 
decreased both the conversion of propane and the yields of products but 
increased the selectivity of propylene at the expense of the selectivity of the CO 
x 
[150]. The reason should be that basic surfaces facilitate the desorption of 
alkenes, more basic compounds than the corresponding alkanes, thus preventing 
them from further oxidation to carbon oxides. It could be the case of the VMgO 
catalysts where the magnesia phase plays the role of basic centers during the 
propane partial oxidation to propylene [ 134-139]. 
However, the effect of the acid-base properties on selective oxidation of 
hydrocarbons is more complex since it should depend on the nature of the 
catalyst (and therefore on its oxidizing properties) and even, on the nature of the 
hydrocarbon molecules [135,151-154]. In addition, in the case of the propane 
molecule, the selective oxidation to propylene probably also needs BrSnsted acid 
sites as shown recently by Moro-oka and Ueda [155] for the MoMgO catalysts. 
The different steps of the routes to propylene and COx, respectively, are 
probably differently sensitive to the acid-base nature and strength of the used 
catalyst. 
4.1.3. Reaction mechanisms and reaction intermediates 
Concerning the reaction mechanism, a general agreement in literature is that 
the rate determining step of the reaction is the breaking of the first C-H bond, 
leading to a propyl species [32,156,157]. Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] 
suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to 
the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step. The surface reactivity 
of propylene produced should also be considered as selectivity determining [35]. 
The selective route to propylene should then be the breaking of the second C-H 
bond of the propyl species whereas the oxygenates (organic products or CO 
x) 
route should involve the insertion of the surface oxygen atom in the alkyl 
intermediate [35]. 
In the mean time, the C-H bond breaking is believed to be homolytic and the

propyl species thus produced should be a propyl radical [35,158,159]. This 
radical species is then able to give propylene either after desorbing in the gas 
phase 
and reacting with 
gaseous 
oxygen or by 
a 
surface reaction 
[35,156,160,161 ]. Then the reaction course depends both on the reaction temper- 
ature and the nature of the catalyst [158,159,162]. High temperature favors the 
alkyl desorption route [158,159] whereas low reaction temperatures and re- 
ducible catalysts promote surface reaction routes [148,159,163]. So, propane 
oxidation over V containing catalysts is considered to be initiated in the gas 
phase and completed on the catalyst surface. Scheme 5 resumes these assump- 
tions. 
It must be mentioned that heterolytic splitting of the C-H bond was also 
proposed in the ODHR of propane. This breaking should lead either to the 
formation a cation by hydride abstraction [164,165] or to the formation of a 
carbanion by proton abstraction [166-168]. The former process should be 
expected to occur on acidic catalysts whereas the latter supposes rather basic 
catalysts. In fact, it should be considered that redox equilibria coexist at the 
catalyst surface whatever the initial mode (homolytic or heterolytic) of activa- 
tion as shown below:

surface vanadium atom). The position of these equilibria depends on the redox 
and acid-base properties of the catalyst and on the reactive atmosphere. 
Other mechanistic schemes can be envisaged. A concerted mechanism 
(Scheme 6A) should be thus considered: the transition state in this case is 
probably of lower energy since it involves simultaneous breaking and forming of 
chemical bonds. In this mechanism the acid-base and redox properties of the 
catalyst play a role as a whole in only one step. 
Another mode of activation of propane should be its adsorption as alkoxy 
species, that is, the occurrence of the direct insertion of a lattice oxygen atom 
into a C-H bond (see also Scheme 6B): 
C3H8 [0] [C3H7OH] H 
+ C3H 6 + H20 
The alkoxy species then decomposes to propylene. This decomposition needs 
the presence of BrSnsted acid sites as can be deduced from the finding of 
22 
M.M. Bettahar et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
Moro-oka and Ueda [155] of the correlation between the propylene formation 
from propane and the number of the BriSnsted acid sites in the case of the 
MoMgO catalysts. The alkoxy route here proposed is also supported by the 
in-situ FT-IR studies of Finnochio et al. [169] showing the formation of 
propyloxy surface species as intermediate to propylene during the oxidation of 
propane over CrMoO catalysts. 
4.1.4. Conclusion 
In conclusion for the ODHR of propane to propylene, the most studied 
catalytic formulation VMgO system consists of a vanadia phase which provides 
the oxidizing properties needed and a magnesia phase which provides the base 
properties decreasing the propylene consecutive oxidation. It is proposed that 
high propylene selectivity needs both V=O and V-O-V isolated sites and the 
overall process is probably initiated in the gas phase and completed on the 
catalyst surface. 
4.2. Formation of acrolein 
The catalytic systems tested in the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein are 
generally defect mixed oxides [19-22,170] in which the presence of vacancies 
are believed to promote the lattice oxygen mobility during the reaction. The best 
obtained formulations up to now are the BiMo(V)O multicomponent catalysts 
developed by Moro-oka et al. [19-21]. Several other formulations have also 
been tested [22-24]. 
4.2.1. BiMo(V)O catalysts 
The most important results obtained by Moro-oka's group [20] are reported in 
Table 3. The main products are acrolein, propylene and carbon oxides. It is

worthwhile to note that, in the operating conditions, the V-P-O catalysts, active 
in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride [31-33] do not give rise to 
acrolein and neither do the VMgO catalysts, active in the ODHR of propane to 
propylene [138]. The molybdenum component is necessary for good activity and 
good selectivity to acrolein but not the vanadium component (compare selectiv- 
ity of BiVO 
4 relative to that of BiMoO or VMoO). The vanadium component 
rather increases the propane conversion (compare propane conversions for 
BiMoO and BiVMoO). The best formulation is Bi 1 
-x/3 Vl-xMxO4 • A signifi- 
cant enhancement of the acrolein selectivity is observed by adding silver 
additive (compare selectivities for BiVMoO and AgBiVMoO). The optimization 
of the system shows that 65% of selectivity to acrolein with a propane 
conversion of 13% can be reached. Lithium and sodium behave also as 
promoting additives for acrolein formation whereas potassium, rubidium and 
tellurium mainly lead to propylene [20]. 
The effects of the reaction temperature, the partial pressure of the reactants 
and the contact time have been investigated [20]. The reaction is believed to 
proceed, at least partly, through a homogeneous auto-oxidation of propane 
occurring in the gas phase. The given experimental evidences were the follow- 
ing [19-21]: 
(i) the reaction started suddenly at 400C; 
(ii) in contrast with what was expected for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, 
the conversion of propane slowly decreased whereas the selectivity to acrolein 
sensibly increased when the reaction temperature was raised; 
(iii) a definite concentration of propane was required for the reaction to 
proceed: it was stopped either when the total concentration of propane and 
oxygen was lowered to 60% (propane oxygen = 0.55; T = 500C) or when the 
ratio propane/oxygen was lowered to 0.14 (propane + oxygen= 91%; T= 
500oc); 
(iv) appreciable amounts of homogeneous propane oxidation (mainly to 
propylene) occurred at 500C in absence of the catalyst. No acrolein was 
detected in these conditions; 
(v) an effect of the reactor volume and of its empty zone on the reaction 
performance was observed, with and without the catalyst. For example no 
reaction was observed when the reactor volume was small with and without 
catalyst. 
These results seem to indicate that propylene was formed as primary product 
in the gas phase whereas acrolein was formed in the second step at the catalyst 
surface [20]. According to the authors [20], propyl radicals should be formed in 
the gas phase at high temperature in the pre-catalyst zone and then homoge- 
neously converted to propylene. These radical species were not considered as 
intermediates for acrolein formation since acrolein was not observed in the 
absence of the catalyst [20]. The source of acrolein remained propylene reacting 
over the metal oxide surface [20]. In Scheme 7 the possible mechanisms of

Scheme 7. Mechanisms of the propane oxidation to acrolein through the propylene intermediate. 
propane oxidation to acrolein via propylene as intermediate are represented. Path 
(a) and (b) represent the gas phase and the surface reactions for the propane 
ODHR step respectively. Path (a) is believed to be the preferred one in the case 
of BiMoO catalysts [19-21]. 
The observation of a homogeneous reaction in the pre-catalyst zone [20] is in 
good accordance with previous works showing that non-catalytic vapour phase 
oxidation of propane takes place in the range 350-500C [171,172]. However, it 
must be underlined that the bismuth molybdate of scheelite type here considered 
does not initiate surface radicals as intermediates of the formation of both 
propylene and acrolein. This behaviour is thus different from that of VMgO 
catalyst we discussed in the precedent section. 
On the other hand, the observed selectivities, in fact, should partly reflect the 
ability of the considered scheelite type B-Mo-O catalysts to convert propylene 
to acrolein [20] and partly the degradation of acrolein under the chosen reaction 
temperature (500C). It is probably the reason why the multicomponent bismuth 
molybdate oxides, highly active catalysts for the oxidation of propylene to 
acrolein at 400C [61], were not suitable when tested in the propane to acrolein 
oxidation reaction at 500C [20]. 
From a practical point of view, two directions of improvement of the 
considered catalytic system emerge from the above results. The first one is the 
improvement of the step of propylene oxidation to acrolein in the overall process 
of partial oxidation of propane. In this sense, comparative studies of catalytic 
propane oxidation and propylene oxidation to acrolein should be of great interest 
and very useful. The second direction is the optimization of the reactor geometry 
in order to improve the first step of the considered reaction, i.e. the homoge- 
neous ODHR of propane to propylene.

4.2.2. Other catalytic systems 
4.2.2.1. Combined propane ODHR and propylene oxidation catalysts. Earlier 
works of Shatalova et al. [173] have shown that combining catalysts of propane 
ODHR (iron and magnesium oxides based catalysts) and catalysts of propylene 
oxidation to acrolein (molybdenum based mixed oxides catalysts) led to signifi- 
cant performances in selective oxidation of propane: 20% of acrolein selectivity 
for 10-30% propane conversion at 600C. No further improvements nor investi- 
gations have been reported up to now by the authors and no definite conclusion 
can be drawn from the obtained results: little is known about the accuracy of the 
products analysis [18]. 
4.2.2.2. Defect perovskite and rutile oxides. Conner et al. [22,174,175] have 
tested defect perovskite and rutile Bi-Ba-Te-O, Fe-Nb-O, Fe-Ta-O oxides. 
The main partial oxidation products are aldehydes (acrolein, propanal, acetalde- 
hyde and formaldehyde) and methanol. Ethylene and methane are observed as 
cracking products but propylene is not detected. Total oxidation products are 
obviously formed, mainly carbon monoxide. The conversions and selectivities of 
the partial oxidation products depend on the reaction temperature for which two 
domains have been distinguished: 
at T < 440C the main products are acetaldehyde and methanol; 
at > 450C propanal and acrolein are mainly formed. 
For both types of catalysts the selectivity of acrolein reached 20% at about 
30% of propane conversion at 425C [22]. 
The reported results cannot be further discussed since no surface characteriza- 
tions have been published by the authors up to now. Nevertheless, it is 
interesting to note the presence of propanal and the absence of propylene in the 
reaction products [22]. 
Propanal formation should take place from propane either through the 1-pro- 
panol intermediate or through the allyl alcohol intermediate isomerisation 
(Scheme 2). 
The 1-propoxy surface species is probably formed by a concerted mechanism 
(Scheme 8) by abstraction of a hydride anion on a Lewis acid/oxidizing site 
from a CH 3 group of propane and the nucleophilic attack of the carbon atom of 
this group by a lattice oxygen atom. This species should turn into propanal. The 
subsequent dehydrogenation of propanal to acrolein is facilitated by the exis- 
tence of the equilibrium formation of its enolate form in which a hydrogen atom 
is abstracted from the CH 2 group as proton on a basic site. The enolate species 
may then lead to acrolein by losing a hydride anion probably by a concerted 
mechanism also on a Lewis acid/oxidizing site. 
The reaction steps of the allyl alcohol to propanal isomerization should be 
similar to those invoked in the case of the hydrogenation of a-j3 unsaturated 
aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols on copper-chromite catalysts

9): 
cr-allyl  acrolein  enolate  propanal 
In this mechanism a surface enolate species should be involved whereas 
surface hydrides should play an important role [14,84,176,177]. This mechanism 
can be considered either as the isomerization of the adsorbed allylic alcohol to 
propanal or as the reduction of acrolein. Note that, through an SN mechanism 
[84], the direct isomerization of the cr-allyl to propanal by-passing the acrolein 
formation, should also be suggested:

The absence of propylene in the reaction products is in favour of the former 
mechanisms rather than the latter, that is the direct formation of propanal from 
propane then acrolein from propane. However, very reactive surface propylene 
species cannot be excluded as reaction intermediates. 
It points out from the above results that defect oxides of perovskite or rutile 
type are relatively active in the partial oxidation of propane into aldehydes but 
lead to substantial oxidative breaking of the C-C bond as well as to products of 
total oxidation. An improvement of their catalytic performances may arise from 
a better comprehension of the observed activities. 
4.2.2.3. Impregnated mixed oxides BMO and PMO. Various impregnated mixed 
oxides BMO and PMO (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mg, A1) have been 
tested by Otsuka et al. [23] as catalysts in the partial oxidation of propane. These 
catalysts are mostly inactive except the B-P-O oxide which leads to significant 
performances. Thus, at 550C, the propane conversion is 22% and the selectivity 
of C3-O products (propanal, acetone, acrolein, acrylic acid) and propylene are 
13% and 47%, respectively. Acetaldehyde (5%), ethylene (23%) and carbon 
oxides (10%) are also obtained. 
It is noteworthy that propylene, propanal, acetone and ethylene stem directly 
from propane as shown by the study of their selectivities as a function of the 
contact time [23]. It is also shown, in the same reaction conditions as for 
propane, that propylene as reactant is not activated on the BPO oxide (conver- 
sion < 1%) and thus cannot be considered as an intermediate in the formation 
of the oxygenate products [23]. We may conclude that the reaction intermediates 
to oxygenate products, which necessarily involves an oxygenation step, should

be probably: (i) the 1-propyloxy species as precursor of propanal, acrolein, 
acrylic acid and (ii) the 2-propyloxy species as precursor of acetone and acetic 
acid (see Scheme 2 and Fig. 8). Moreover, the 2-propyloxy species should also 
be the precursor of propylene as discussed above (see Section 4.1. 
Moritaka et al. [24] reported that the precipitated mixed oxides PMO (M = V, 
Cu, Ni, Mn, La, Co, Cr, Zr) are more active than the impregnated ones in the 
partial oxidation of propane. The main product formed is propylene: up to 25% 
(50%) of selectivity for 22% (3%) of propane conversion for M = V (Co) and 
the selectivity of oxygenates (acrolein, propanal, acetone, propanoic acid, acetic 
acid, acetaldehyde) may reach 40% (M = Cu, Ni, Mn). The selectivity of the 
cracking products is 7-10%. The detection of propanal and propanoic acid, 
which cannot be only derived from propylene, strengthens once again the 
existence of a direct path of production of oxygenate products from propane 
by-passing the propylene intermediate (Scheme 8). 
4.2.2.4. ODHR of propane and propylene. At this level of the discussion it is of 
interest to get back to the work of Volta et al. [138] on the ODHR of propane to 
propylene, and specially to the comparison between propane and propylene 
oxidation (Table 4). Three observations can be made. 
First, the -MgzV20 7 phase favors mild oxidation either for the partial 
oxidation of propane (70.8% against 6.0-45.8% for the two other Mg phases) or 
for the partial oxidation of propylene (49.1% against 0-30% for the other two 
Mg phases). Acrolein was the major oxygenate product (71.3-72.7% of relative 
selectivity) for the o-MgzVzO 
7 phase whereas acetaldehyde is the only oxy- 
genate product obtained (100% of relative selectivity) for the t-MgV206 phase. 
No oxygenate at all but CO 
x (94% of selectivity) are produced over the 
Mg 3V208 phase. 
The second point is that, whatever the reactant feed, propane or propylene, a 
striking quite equal distribution of oxygenate products was obtained over the 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
29 
cx-Mg 
2 VzO 7 phase. Indeed, the relative selectivities are quite identical: 72.7% 
(acrolein), 21.2% (propanal), 6.0% (acetic acid) and 0.0% (acetaldehyde) in the 
case of the propane reactant against 71.3%, 22.6%, 6.1% and 0.0% respectively 
in the case of the propylene reactant. The precedent equalities can be considered 
as not fortuitous but should indicate that the observed oxygenates produced in 
the partial oxidation of propane rather stem from propylene intermediate. This 
conclusion seems to be held in the case of the o-Mg2V206 phase which gave 
only acetaldehyde with the same 100% relative selectivity when starting either 
from propylene or from propane. In the same way, the Mg3V20 
s phase gave 
strikingly almost CO 
x (94.0-100.0%) for the two reactants. 
All these results are in agreement with a reaction mechanism where propylene 
is the precursor of the oxygenate products in the partial oxidation of propane 
over V-MgO catalyst (Scheme 2). 
The third point is the obtaining of propanal with both propane and propylene 
reactants (Table 4). Propylene is expected to oxidize to acrolein through the 
allylic process and to acetone or acetic acid through the oxyhydration process 
(see Section 3). The lack of acetone formation seems to indicate that the 
presence of basic centers inhibits the hydration step (which needs BrSnsted 
acid-sites) at the benefit of the formation of propanal through the allyl species 
(see Section 4 and Scheme 9):

However, the competitive formation then oxidation of 1-propyloxy species

be excluded:

The former should be more reactive towards oxidation than hydration (k 1 >> 
k 2) than the latter. Indeed, preliminary results obtained in our laboratory have 
shown that, on supported VPO catalysts, 1-propanol is oxidized mainly to 
propanal (propylene is obtained as a minor product) whereas 2-propanol is 
oxidized mainly to propylene (acetone is obtained as minor product) [178]. 
The same reasoning and conclusions can be held for the results obtained for 
30 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
the propane partial oxidation if we assume, as discussed above in the second 
point, that propylene is the intermediate species to oxygenate products. 
It must be said that, obviously, the results of Table 4 need further investiga- 
tions (notably kinetics) in order to determine the reaction paths and to under- 
stand the formation of propanal in the selective oxidation of both propylene and 
propane over the VMgO catalysts. 
4.2.3. Conclusions 
The BiMoO mixed oxides of the scheelite type exhibit interesting catalytic 
performances but it must be noted that these catalysts do no really activate 
propane but propylene which is shown to be homogeneously produced in the gas 
phase as intermediate and then oxidized to acrolein on the catalyst surface. So 
the expected improvements of the BiMoO catalytic system mainly consist in the 
addition of promoters capable of increasing the oxidation step of propylene to 
acrolein. In parallel, the optimization of the geometry of the reactor should 
contribute to improve the homogeneous ODHR of propane to propylene, and, 
consequently, to improve the overall process. 
The defect mixed oxides of perovskite or rutile type (BaBiTeO, FeNbVO and 
FeTaO) and the BPO based mixed oxides were found active in the partial 
oxidation of propane (up to 25% of conversion), but less selective to acrolein 
(< 10%). However, they could be good candidates for further improvements 
since they produced, besides COx, mainly C1-C 3 aldehydes or C l-C2 alcohols 
(defect mixed oxides) and good selectivities (up to 65%) for partial oxidation 
products (propylene + oxygenates). 
It is worthwhile to note that the VMgO catalysts, specifically used for the 
ODHR of propane to propylene, also produced appreciable amounts of acrolein 
and propanal from propane (16-30% selectivity at 6-8% conversion). They 
should also be good candidates for the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein. 
4.3. Formation of acrylonitrile 
The above discussions show that a general aspect of propane oxidation is the 
low selectivity to products of partial oxidation, notably due to the too high rate 
of the consecutive oxidation of the products formed. A possible key factor to 
reduce this rate is to carry out the oxidation in presence of ammonia, forming 
the more stable product, acrylonitrile which, in addition, belongs to the basic 
chemicals [179,180]. These considerations, besides the lower price of propane as 
compared to the price of propylene [29,179], led to new and notable interest to 
the catalytic ammoxidation of propane [ 
19-21,27-30,164,180-182]. 
The earliest catalytic systems reported for propane ammoxidation were those 
reported by G. Minow et al. [183,184] and Z. Osipova et al. [185,186] and 
consisted of V, Mo, Bi-Mo supported oxides and Ga-Sb mixed oxides. Low 
activities and selectivities to acrylonitrile were formed and the formation of

propylene as an intermediate was proposed with an important contribution of gas 
phase reactions in the mechanism of propane oxidation [183,184]. 
The most promising results concern the BiMo(V)O (Table 5) and VSbO 
systems (Table 6). 
4.3.1. Bi-Mo(V)-O catalysts 
The BiMo(V)O oxides of scheelite type structure are active and selective in 
the ammoxidation of propane as shown by the results reported by Moro-oka [21 ] 
(Table 5). The reaction was carried out at high partial pressure of propane. For 
example, the scheelite type complex Bi0.85Nbo.55Mo0.4504 gave more than 60% 
selectivity to acrylonitrile at about 20% conversion under 40% of propane in the 
feed gas at atmospheric pressure and 515C. The other products are propylene, 
acetonitrile and carbon oxides. 
The most striking feature of the obtained performances is that they are similar 
to those obtained in the partial oxidation of propane to acrolein (Table 5), 
particularly in the case of the most active and selective catalysts: AgBiVMoO 
gave 63.5% of acrolein selectivity at 13.1% of propane conversion (500C) in 
absence of ammonia and 64.8% of acrylonitrile at 15.8% of conversion (515C) 
in presence of ammonia. As in the case of propane oxidation to acrolein 
[15-21], the selectivity to acrylonitrile increased markedly with increasing 
reaction temperature and propylene is formed in absence of catalyst, notably at 
high temperature [21]. These similar catalytic performances suggest similar 
reaction mechanisms, i.e. a homogeneous reaction step where propylene is 
formed, followed by a heterogeneous reaction where acrylonitrile (acrolein) is 
produced [21] (Scheme 7, path a). However, compared to propane oxidation 
results [ 19-21 ], in propane ammoxidation: 
(i) no sudden start of propane conversion was observed when the catalyst was 
present; 
(ii) the selectivity to propylene was apparently low in non-catalytic conditions 
as compared to catalytic conditions. 
These effects are attributed to the presence of ammonia [21 ]. Ammonia seems 
either to inhibit the propylene gaseous formation or/and to promote its surface 
formation since conversions and selectivities to acrolein and acrylonitrile, 
respectively, are quite similar (Table 5). As, in addition, no dinitrogen formation 
32 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
was observed, we may conclude that ammonia, as additive, only plays the role 
of a nucleophile by shifting the reaction equilibria to the consecutive oxidation 
of acrolein to acrylonitrile. In this way, ammonia seems to modify the acid-base 
and/or the nucleophilic surface properties of the considered catalysts but not 
their redox surface properties. To clarify this point, investigations on these 
surface are needed since studies on the effect of ammonia were not reported up 
to now for these catalysts. 
4.3.2. VSbO catalysts 
It was found that VSbO catalyst are effective for the ammoxidation of 
propane [18,27-30,181,182] and are promising for industrial use. Table 6 
resumes the main reported formulations. It can be seen that a maximum of 40% 
selectivity to acrylonitrile was attained at about 80% conversion. 
G. Centi et al. [27,30] studied the ammoxidation of propane on VSbO 
catalysts prepared by coprecipitation of vanadium and antimony soluble salts in 
aqueous ammonia. Acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, propylene and carbon oxides were 
formed. High activity was found when vanadium was in excess and high 
selectivity to acrylonitrile when antimony was in excess. Better performances 
were also obtained when alumina was incorporated to the VSbO oxide due to 
the occurrence of specific structural effects [28]. For the VSb(A1)O system, the 
active phase for the propane ammoxidation was suggested to be the amorphous 
VSbOa/Sb204 system epitaxially intergrown with the A1SbO 
4 rutile phase. 
Further improvements were obtained by addition of W or Mo elements. On the 
other hand, the A1SbO 
4 phase, promoted by the V eluent, was found as active as 
for the ODHR of propane to propylene [28]. The kinetic studies showed that 
acrylonitrile is formed both indirectly through propylene intermediate and 
directly from propane, the former path being the prevalent one (Scheme 10)

Scheme 10. Kinetic routes of propane oxidation over VSbO catalysts (from Ref. [28]). 
[28]. When the ammonia concentration is increased in the feed gas, the 
propylene selectivity increased whereas the acrylonitrile selectivity passed 
through a maximum (Table 7). 
Anderson et al. [192] investigated VSbO systems prepared by the slurry 
procedure with various V/Sb ratios. The fresh catalysts consisted of V205 and 
SbVO 
4 phases when vanadia was in excess. In this case, high rate and 
selectivity to propylene were obtained at low conversion and were related to the 
formation of amorphous vanadia spread over the surface of SbVO 
4 as suggested 
by XRD, Raman, IR and XPS experiments. The fresh catalysts consisted of 
SbVO 
4 and ot-Sb204 phases when antimony was in excess. These phases were 
the most selective to acrylonitrile due probably to their ability to transform 
intermediate propylene, as suggested by Raman and IR studies: these phases in 
interaction are more efficiently reoxidized than SbVO 4 alone during propane 
ammoxidation [192]. This behaviour was linked to the formation of suprasurface 
antimony sites on SbVO 
4 resulting from antimony migration from the e-SbO 
4 
phase during the reaction course, in good accordance with XPS studies [192]. 
Kinetic results indicated that propane adsorption is the rate limiting step for 
propylene formation and that acrylonitrile and carbon oxides were produced 
from the intermediate propylene. Acrylonitrile and acetonitrile formations passed 
through a maximum when the ammonia pressure was increased due to the 
competitive adsorption between the propane reactant and ammonia [193-195]. 
As to carbon oxides formation, it decreased with the partial pressure of 
ammonia; this was explained by a competitive adsorption of ammonia and 
oxygen [192] leading to a decrease of the concentration of surface degradation

oxygen species [194,195]. The effect of ammonia partial pressure observed on 
the VSbO catalysts prepared by the slurry method was similar to that observed 
on the VSbO catalyst prepared by coprecipitation [27,28]. 
Addition of water vapour led to an increase of the rate and selectivity for 
acrylonitrile formation. We think that this result should be associated to a 
competitive route of acrylonitrile formation through the oxyhydration of acrolein 
to acrylic acid or/and to a better desorption of adsorbed acrylonitrile in 
presence of an excess of water:

The kinetics of the partial oxidation of propane to acrylonitrile were also 
studied for VSbAI(W)O mixed oxides prepared by the slurry procedure [181,196] 
and the catalysts were characterized by X-Ray and Raman, IR and XPS 
spectroscopy. The obtained results were similar to those observed in the case of 
VSbAI(W) catalysts prepared by coprecipitation (Scheme 10) [28]. Indeed, the 
A1SbO 
4 rutile phase was found to be formed, probably by epitaxial intergrown 
or as solid solution component with the VSbO4/ot-Sb204 system. Both V and 
Sb were reduced during the reaction and the reduced state was stabilized by the 
A1SbO 
4 rutile-type phase. This phase also limits the presence of unselective 
vanadium species responsible of NH 3 oxidation to N 2. Acrylonitrile was shown 
to be formed by two parallel pathways: directly from propane ammoxidation and 
dominantly through the intermediate propylene ammoxidation. The allylic oxida- 
tion step of propylene to acrylonitrile competed with the high rate of propylene 
oxidation to carbon oxides. Acrylonitrile was found to be more stable than 
propylene to consecutive oxidation to carbon oxides. The propylene to acryloni- 
trile reaction is also limited by NH 3 oxidation to N 2 which decreases the surface 
availability of NH 3. 
4.3.3. Conclusions 
Promising results have been obtained in the ammoxidation of propane over 
BiMo(V)O and VSbO based mixed oxides. Propylene, the main reaction inter- 
mediate to acrylonitrile, seems to be produced in the gas phase in the case of the 
BiMo(V)O catalysts and on the catalyst surface in the case of the VSbO based 
mixed oxides. The investigations on the VSb(A1)O catalysts show that the active 
phase should be the amorphous VSbO4/Sb204 system in interaction with the 
A1SbO 
4 rutile phase, vanadium and antimony ions being reduced during the 
reaction 
course.

4.4. Formation of acrylic acid 
4.4.1. Propane oxidation over VPO catalysts 
Propane oxidation to acrylic acid on VPO based catalysts has been studied by 
Ai [26] at 350-400C in large excess of oxygen (oxygen/propane = 32.50) and 
of water (water/propane = 16.25). The main products were acrylic acid, acetic 
acid and carbon oxides. The yield of acrylic acid was 7% at 60% of propane 
conversion. Excess of phosphorus with respect to P/V = 1.00 composition 
induced a large decrease in both the activity and selectivity to both acids. The 
reaction was promoted by TeO 
2 addition to the VPO oxide [25]. Incorporation 
of acidic compounds such as H3PW12040 , Sb20 3 and Nb205 increased the 
activity but decreased the yields of both acrylic and acetic acid [26]. The 
incorporation of H3PMo12040 to a VPO catalyst (P/V = 1,00) greatly enhanced 
the formation of acetic acid at the expense of the formation of acrylic acid. High 
content of water also enhanced the acids formation [25]. Propylene is proposed 
as the main precursor of both acrylic and acetic acids [25]. 
4.4.2. Propane oxidation over cesium catalysts 
The propane oxidation to acrylic acid was also studied by Mizuno et al. [197] 
over Cs2.sHo.sPMolzO40 modified either by exchanging the acidic proton by 
several counter ions (Fe 
3+, Ni 2, Co 2, Cu 
2+, Mn 
2) or by substituting the 
coordination ion Mo 6+ by V 5+ ions. The reaction conditions were: T= 300- 
400C and C3H8/Oz/N2 = 30/40/30. The reaction products were: acrylic 
acid, acetic acid, acrolein, propylene and carbon oxides. Fe 3+ or Ni 2+ substitu- 
tion for H +, and V 5+ substitution for Mo 6+ in Cs2.sH05Mo12040 greatly 
enhanced the catalytic activity for direct oxidation of propane into acrylic acid. 
The best performance (13 % yield of acrylic acid at 48% of propane conversion) 
was observed with Cs 2.5 
Fe0.08 
H 1.26VMo 11040 . 
5. General remarks 
5.1. Propane versus propylene selective oxidation 
(1) The main remark about the results reported above is that the catalytic 
formulations used for propane selective oxidation are very different from the 
catalytic formulation used in the selective oxidation of propylene. Particularly, 
the former generally contains vanadia phases but not the latter. The main reason, 
as recalled in the introduction part, is the lesser reactivity of propane as 
compared to propylene reactivity: propane activation needs a higher reaction 
temperature (500C against 400C for propylene) and, as a consequence, strong 
activating phases such as vanadia. The difference of reactivity between propane 
and propylene is linked to the strengths of the involved C-H bonds and to the 
stability of the corresponding radicals formed in the rate determining step by H 
abstraction: the less stable propyl radical (corresponding to the stronger C-H 
36 
M.M. Bettahar et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
bond) needs higher reaction temperatures and stronger oxidizing phases to be 
produced than the most stable "rr-allyl-radical (corresponding to the weaker C-H 
bond breaking). 
(2) It seems that, inversely, propylene reacts relatively smoothly over cata- 
lysts of partial oxidation of propane. Indeed, in this reaction, substantial yields 
of propylene are generally produced as compared to organic compounds or 
carbon oxides yields. This well indicates that the reactivity of propylene is 
relatively low in the conditions of the partial oxidation of propane. The 
phenomenon was kinetically quantified for the ammoxidation of propane over 
VSbO based catalysts [30,181,192]: the rate of selective oxidation of propylene 
intermediate was found lower than the rate of its non-selective oxidation to 
carbon oxides. From a practical point of view, it can be said that further 
improvements of the direct oxidation of propane to organic compounds passes 
through the improvement of the selective oxidation of propylene intermediate in 
order to overcome its oxidation to carbon oxides. 
(3) Lattice oxygen atoms participate to the propylene oxidation to acrolein or 
acrylonitrile (see Section 4 and 5) over the different systems used (BiMoO, 
SbSnO, Cu20 mixed oxides) and the suggested active sites are bridged oxygen 
atoms M-O-M 
associated to the Mo=O double bond(s) for the BiMoO 
catalyst. Isolated sites are believed to give high selectivities [35]. The lattice 
oxygen atoms for the partial oxidation of propane to propylene over VMgO 
mixed oxides also participate to the reaction process, the active sites being 
V-O-V(Mg) and V=O [138,139,141]. Regarding the partial oxidation of 
propane to organic compounds, only a few number of studies have been 
undertaken concerning the nature of the active sites and the role of the lattice 
oxygen atoms. For the VSbO catalysts, it has been shown that vanadium and 
antimony are reduced during the reaction course and the selective site was 
proposed to be the complex system VSbO4/oSb204, interacting with the 
A1SbO 
4 rutile phase when alumina is present in the used mixed oxide. In the 
case of MS+OPt4 (M = V, Mo, Nb, Ta), the ratios acrolein/propylene and 
acrylonitrile/propylene were found to be related to V=O bond strength [164]. 
Further investigations are needed to a better understanding of the involved 
processes. 
5.2. Reaction mechanisms and intermediates in the partial oxidation of propane 
The reaction mechanisms and intermediates (Tr-allyl, cr-allyl species) are now 
well established for the partial oxidation of propylene but not for propane partial 
oxidation. Taking into account the experimental data reported above, we can 
outline the reaction paths in the partial oxidation of propane to organic com- 
pounds as following: 
(i) the main route involves propylene intermediate for the BiMo(V)O, VSbO, 
NiMoTeO, CoMoTeO and VPTeO catalysts. Propylene production occurs on the 
M.M. Bettahar et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
37 
surface of the catalysts except for the BiMo(V)O catalyst for which propylene is 
formed in the gas phase. However, the direct oxidation of propane to oxygenate 
products was reported as the main route for the BPO catalysts. This route was 
also deduced kinetically but to a minor extent for the VSbO catalysts; 
(ii) the oxyhydration of the propylene intermediate leading to by-products 
(acetone/acetic acid, acetonitrile) competed with the allylic oxidation leading to 
the desired products (acrolein, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile) over the BiMo(V)O, 
VSbO, NiMoTeO, CoMoTeO and VPTeO catalysts. 
The observed yields and selectivities depended on the nature of the catalysts 
and on the reaction conditions (notably on the presence and concentration of 
water or/and ammonia). 
Regarding the reaction intermediates, it is widely believed [32-35,156] that 
propyl species are formed in the first and rate determining step during the 
ODHR of propane to propylene. As to the selective oxidation of propane to 
organic compounds, few details are known about the involved adsorbed species. 
It is implicitly believed that propyl species are first formed (in analogy with the 
ODHR of propane to propylene) and that "rr- and o'-allyl species are then 
successively formed (in analogy with the mechanisms of propylene oxidation to 
organic compounds). However, no experimental evidence has been reported up 
to now. The proposals are generally rather speculative and we summarize the 
discussions as following. 
The most important point discussed is the mode of activation of propane, 
because it determines the reaction rate and also, probably, the reaction selectivi- 
ties. For Michalakos et al. [35], the propyl radical is formed first and its 
reactivity determines the reaction selectivities. As for us, we have above 
reported that organic products seemed to be formed directly from propane in 
some cases, by-passing the propylene intermediate, we inferred that necessarily 
direct insertion of lattice oxygen occurs in the C-H bond of propane leading to 
1-propyloxy or 2-propyloxy species formation as precursors of oxygenate prod- 
ucts and, even, of propylene (Scheme 8). An argument in favour of this route is 
the FT-IR results obtained by Finocchio et al. [169] showing the formation of 
2-propyloxy adsorbed species leading to propylene intermediate then to organic 
products and CO x during the oxidation of propane over CrMgO mixed oxides. 
The alkoxy route is also in good accordance with crystallographic [40] and 
quantum [41] calculations showing that during the catalytic oxidation of n-butane 
to maleic anhydride, the hydrocarbon molecules activation mainly occurs through 
the interaction between the lattice oxygen atoms and the terminal carbon atoms: 
the 1-4-n-butyl dioxy species was thus proposed as the initial precursor of 
maleic anhydride formation [40,41 ]. 
In fact, the existence of both propyl and propyloxy species are not incompati- 
ble since the latter should stem from the former:

depending on the oxidizing power of the oxide. Indeed, we proposed in Section 
3 that propyl species as radical or ionic (cationic/anionic) species probably 
interact at the surface of the catalyst, the position of the equilibria depending on 
the nature of considered metal cation. Moreover, we can say that the distinction 
between propyl species adsorbed on a metal oxide and propyloxy species 
adsorbed on the same oxide should be difficult to establish experimentally, all 
the considered propyl species interact most probably with a lattice oxygen atom 
than with a surface metal cation: the carbon-oxygen interaction is expected to 
be stronger than the carbon-metal interaction. 
To conclude this point, and referring to Michalakos et al.'s [35] proposal, we 
think that the main route of propane activation involves its dissociative adsorp- 
tion to isopropyl or 2-propyloxy surface species leading to propylene then to the 
organic compounds (Scheme 11): the relative selectivities depend on the nature 
of the oxide and also probably on the structure of its surface since geometrical 
considerations have to be taken into account [35]. The other route should be the 
dissociative adsorption of propane as 1-propyloxy species by nucleophilic attack 
of the terminal CH 3 group by lattice 0 2 
species (Scheme 8 and Fig. 11): the 
formation of the n-propyl species can be excluded because it should be too much 
unstable as compared to the isopropyl species. The 1-propyloxy species then 
transform either to propylene or to organic products. Thus, the propylene 
precursors may be both isopropyl or 1 and 2-propyloxy surface species; the 
latter should be also the precursor of organic compounds. The nature and the 
number of steps to organic products cannot be discussed because of the lack of 
experimental data reported in the literature. Scheme 13 summarizes the reaction 
paths above suggested.

5.3. Role of water 
Water plays an important role in the catalytic selective oxidation of hydrocar- 
bons. Indeed, water is produced during the reaction, and, as such, should 
influence its course as reactant [25,26,126,127,197] or/and the stability of 
active phase of the catalyst [198,199] or that of the active sites [200,201]. 
For a better understanding of the chemical role of water, it is important to 
recall that the catalytic oxidation of an aldehyde to its corresponding carboxylic 
acid consists in its dissociation into carboxylate species [202] which then should 
desorb as carboxylic molecules (Scheme 12A). In analogy with oxidation of 
aldehydes with chromic acid or potassium permanganate in solution [203,204], 
gem-diol species (RCH(OH) 2) or their corresponding salt (RCH(OM) 2) are first 
formed by nucleophilic attack of O 2- or OH-species [205] then transformed into 
carboxylate species [204,205] (Scheme 12A). In the presence of water molecules 
the surface hydroxyl species concentration is high, then the nucleophilic attack 
probably mainly proceeds through these species (Scheme 12B). In addition, in 
the considered mechanism, water molecules are regenerated and thus water 
appears as a co-catalyst in the reaction (Scheme 12B). In connection, it is 
worthwhile to note that benzaldehyde is heterogeneously oxidized to benzoic 
acid by water over zirconium oxide [206]. In this case molecular hydrogen is 
evolved:

M.M. Bettahar et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
This example clearly shows that water is both a nucleophilic and oxidizing 
reactant [207]. 
This behaviour of the water molecules explains the increase of acrylic acid 
selectivity at the expense of acrolein selectivity when their content is increased 
during the partial oxidation of propylene [118,121]: acrolein intermediate is 
oxidized to acrylic acid through the nucleophilic attack of water molecules. In 
absence of water in the feed gas, acrylic acid is more likely produced with the 
help of water formed during the reaction as observed for the partial oxidation of 
propylene [118,119]: in this case acrolein is observed as by-product, probably 
because water molecules are not in high enough concentration. The same 
behaviour of water is observed when propane is the feed gas [25,197]: for 
example, with a high water/propane ratio (> 16), acrolein is not formed but 
acrylic acid [24]. 
On the other hand, besides acrylic acid, substantial yields of acetic acid are 
obtained due to the oxyhydration [126,127] reaction of propylene (reactant or 
intermediate). Then the related yields of the carboxylic acids and acrolein 
reflects the competition of the corresponding routes of formation:

41 
depending on the reaction conditions, the presence of water should be beneficial 
or detrimental or both to the desired valuable products (propylene, acrolein, 
acrylic acid) whatever the reactant feed (propane or propylene). For propylene 
as reaction product, it is obvious that the presence (or the addition) of water 
should be detrimental to its selectivity since its further oxidation to acetic acid 
and CO 
x through the hydration step should be enhanced [126,127]. This 
enhancement of acetic acid and CO, should also be detrimental to acrolein 
selectivity since the propylene intermediate should be deleted. On the other 
hand, water addition increases acrylic acid yields [25] at the expense of acrolein 
yields. If we only consider acrylic acid formation, water is both beneficial to its 
formation through acrolein oxidation and detrimental to its selectivity through 
the competitive formation of acetic acid [27]. As to acrylonitrile formation, it 
was shown that addition of water in the feed gas increased its rate of formation 
and selectivity [26], probably due to an increase of the rate of desorption of 
acrylonitrile, or, even, by favouring the oxyhydration of the acrolein intermedi- 
ate to acrylic acid then to acrylonitrile. 
5.3.1. Role of the acid and the base sites 
From the above discussion, it appears that the role of water (in-situ produced 
or added in the feed gas) is linked to the presence of acid-base sites during the 
partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. This role should be more complex than 
generally believed as we have shown by an in-situ FT-IR study of the ODHR of 
propane to propylene over VPO/TiO 2 catalysts [201]. Indeed, at 350C, addi- 
tion of water decreased the yields of propylene and CO, (probably by competi- 
tive adsorption between water and propane) but increased the selectivity of the 
former at the expense of the latter. In the mean time, water increased the 
BriSnsted acid sites at the expense of the Lewis acid sites and a good correlation 
has been established between the formation of propylene and the Brtinsted acid 
sites in one hand and between the formation of CO 2 and the Lewis acid sites on 
the other hand. 
Further, it is remarkable that BrSnsted acid sites are necessary to the 
formation of propylene [155,201] but, also, to its degradation to CO, through the 
oxyhydration reaction [126,127] (Scheme 1). It is probably the reason why 
decreasing the number of BriSnsted acid sites by incorporating alkaline or 
alkaline-earth cations to vanadium or molybdenum supported catalysts, de- 
creased the yields of both propylene and CO 
x for the ODHR of propane [150]. 
In the mean time an increase of the selectivity of propylene at the expense of the 
selectivity of CO 
x was observed [150]. This behaviour should be linked to the 
easier desorption of propylene on basic surface [34,35], but also to the difference 
of sensitivity of the reaction of formation of propylene and CO 
x to the nature 
and/or the strength of the catalyst surface acidity. On the other hand, an 
increase of the surface basicity should stop to a too great extent the reaction by 
the total inhibition of the propane activation. So, it can be said that a good 
42 
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
balance between the acid and the basic surface properties is required for the 
obtention of the desired product. 
5.3.2. Role of the oxidizing sites 
Obviously the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons depends on the acid-base 
properties but also on the redox properties of the used catalyst [7,121,207,208]. 
Among several examples we report the following ones: (i) the presence of 
alkaline cations on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts active for the ODHR of 
propane decreases both the reducibility of vanadium species and the number of 
surface acid sites [ 151,152]. The lower the reducibility of vanadium species the 
lower the catalytic activity is, independently of the alkane reactant, whereas the 
selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depends both on the acid-base 
character of the catalysts and of the number of carbon atoms of the alkane 
reactant [151]; (ii) in the partial oxidation of propane to organic compounds 
incorporation of H3PMoI204o to a VPO catalyst enhanced the acetic acid yield 
rather than the acrylic acid yield [26]: as H3PMl12040 is both an acidic and an 
oxidizing additive, it may be concluded that the observed activity enhancement 
is due to the increase of both the surface acidity (which favours the hydration of 
the propylene intermediate) and the oxidizing power (which favours the oxida- 
tion of the alkoxy surface intermediate) of the catalyst; (iii) on the contrary, the 
incorporation of phosphorus (a surface acidity promoter) in the g205 catalyst 
led to a decrease of the oxidizing properties whereas it increased the allylic 
reaction relative to the oxyhydration reaction during the oxidation of propylene 
to acrylic acid [121]. So there is a mutual influence between the acid-base and 
the oxidizing properties of the surface for the metal mixed oxides. However, 
quantitative correlations between these properties and the catalytic performances 
cannot be easily determined. What one can say is that a good mix between the 
considered properties is necessary to obtain the desired product during the 
partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. 
5.4. Role of ammonia 
It is worth noting that the effect of ammonia depends on the nature of the 
catalyst and even, probably, on the nature of the reaction. Indeed, in the case of 
propane ammoxidation on the BiMo(V)O scheelite type catalysts [18-20], 
ammonia seems to only provide nucleophilic surface species which attack the 
carbonyl group of adsorbed acrolein to acetonitrile: 
[o] 
R-CHO + NHza 
d  R-CH(NH)OH 
 
R-C--=N 
-2H20 
Concerning the ammoxidation of propylene on the BiMoO or SbO [80] based 
catalysts or of propane on the VSbO catalysts [27-30,181,192] the situation is 
more complex. When the concentration of ammonia is increased in the propane 
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
43 
feed gas for example, propane conversion and CO 
x selectivity decrease, propy- 
lene selectivity increases whereas a maximum is observed for acrylonitrile 
selectivity (Table 7). These results then show a strong effect of ammonia on the 
surface properties of these catalysts: 
-- 
neutralisation of acidic (BrSnsted or Lewis) sites leading to the inhibition 
of propane activation, specially towards the total oxidation, thus explaining the 
decrease of propane conversion and CO 
x selectivity; 
-- reduction of the catalyst surface shown by N 2 formation, which enhances 
propylene selectivity in good accordance with results obtained for the ODHR of 
propane to propylene when the basicity of the catalysts was increased 
[138,139,201]; 
-- 
increase of the nucleophilic character of the catalyst surface, which 
enhances the rate of the nucleophilic attack by NH 2 fragments of the carbonyl 
function of acrolein conjugated with the decrease of its oxidizing character 
(which inhibits acrolein formation) explaining the observed maximum in acryl- 
onitrile selectivity. 
The above considerations also suggest that a good mix of the acid-base and 
redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of 
the reaction towards selective products. 
6. 
Conclusions 
If the selective oxidation of propylene is now a well established industrial 
process, the selective oxidation of propane to valuable products (propylene, 
acrolein acrylonitrile, acrylic acid) is a new challenge in catalytic oxidation and, 
though many obstacles have to be overcome, some promising results begin to be 
obtained. Indeed, fairly good performances have been obtained, notably for 
acrylonitrile production: 
65% of propylene selectivity at 15% of propane conversion over VMgO 
catalysts; 
65% of acrolein selectivity at 15% of propane conversion over BiMo(V)O 
catalysts 80% of acrylonitrile selectivity at 40% of propane conversion over 
VSbO catalysts. 
These performances are by far lower than those obtained when propylene is 
the feedstock: up to 95% of acrolein selectivity at 90% of propylene conversion 
have been reported over Bi-Mo-O catalysts. This indicates that further work is 
needed for the improvement of the partial oxidation of propane. 
From a fundamental point of view, if it is established that the propane 
activation is the rate determining step, the overall process of the selective 
oxidation of propane to organic products is still less understood. We can say that 
this process needs acid/oxidizing sites for the C-H bonds activation as well as 
basic/nucleophilic sites for protons abstraction (formation of C=C double 
44 
M.M. Bettahar et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 1-48 
bond) or for the oxygen/nitrogen atom insertion (formation of the C-O/C-N 
bonds). Though the exact structure of these sites has still to be determined, the 
intervention of acidic (oxidant) and basic (nucleophilic) pairs of sites is impera- 
tive for each elementary step. This intervention is most probably concerted so as 
to minimize the required activation energies. The electronic structure of the 
organic adsorbed species has also to be taken into account in the involved 
elementary steps. In other words, the invoked elementary mechanisms as well as 
their number require a specific surface structure in order to obtain a high enough 
selectivity of the overall oxidation process. This explain the failure of obtaining 
performant catalysts for the partial oxidation of propane to organic compounds 
until now. So, a better knowledge of the structure of the demanded surface as 
well as a better understanding of the overall process (kinetics and mechanisms) 
are the key for the design of the active and selective catalysts. Comparative 
studies of propane and propylene partial oxidation should be also very useful. In 
this sense, we hope that the present review should be helpful.
