Abstract
A review of the current status and future trends in oxidation catalysis is presented. The topics entail the (amm)oxidation of
propylene to acrylonitrile using complex multicomponent mixed metal molybdates and antimonates as catalysts, the
ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile using V-Sb-oxides or V-Te-Nb-Mo-oxides, the oxydehydrogenation of light parafns
using Ni-Co-molybdates or Mg-V-Sb-oxides, dehydrogenation of propane combined with selective hydrogen oxidation using
Group VIII elements, oxidation of propane to acrylic acid using complex molybdates, and the (amm)oxidation of xylenes to
terepthalic acid or terepthalonitrile using Fe-Mo-modied ZSM-5 catalysts.
The respective reaction mechanism of the prevailing selective catalytic oxidations are discussed, as are the specic
functionalities of the various elements contained in the mixed metal catalysts. Some new approaches to the rational design and
synthesis of improved catalysts are offered. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction
Selective catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation
processes of hydrocarbons comprise approximately
one quarter of the value produced by all catalytic
processes world wide. They contribute hence signi-
cantly to the gross national product of industrial
countries and afford future opportunities for develop-
ing countries.
These processes are not only important from a
commercial standpoint and their contribution to the
well-being of modern mankind, but they also present
the opportunity for signicant fundamental research.
Such research aims at the molecular level understand-
ing of catalytic behavior, forming a basis for rational
design of catalyst improvement of existing processes
and the discovery of totally new catalysts and pro-
cesses.
This paper limits itself to the chemistry of selective
oxidation and ammoxidation processes of large
volume chemicals and intermediates, addressing their
current status and presenting the author's views of
future opportunities. Although only the catalysis of
large volume chemicals is addressed, the principles
advanced are also applicable to the catalysis of ne
chemicals production.

Discussion
2.1.
Ammoxidation of olefins
The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile
commands the foremost commercial position among
all ammoxidation processes [1,2]:
CH2CHCH3  NH3  3=2O2 air
!
catalyst CH2CHCN  3H2O
More than 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile are
produced worldwide by this SOHIO (now BP Amer-
ica) invented process. Acrylonitrile is a versatile pet-
rochemical intermediate used extensively in the
production of acrylic bers, resins, rubbers and
specialty products.
As is well documented in [1,2], ammoxidation is a
six-electron redox process (Fig. 1) requiring catalysts
able to activate propylene through the abstraction of
an a-hydrogen, followed by NH-insertion, subsequent
rearrangements of the chemisorbed activated surface
species with additional hydrogen abstraction, and
culminating in the desorption of the so formed acry-
lonitrile from the catalyst surface. The catalyst which
is reduced in this propylene ammoxidation process is
continuously regenerated in situ by gaseous oxygen
present in the air of the feed gas mixture. This occurs
by facile lattice oxygen transport from a surface
reoxidation site, where dioxygen is built into the
catalyst, to the reduced active center as shown in
Fig. 1. In this manner the catalytic cycle of ammox-
idation is completed: one molecule of propylene and
ammonia, and one and one half dioxygens are con-
sumed with the production of one molecule of acry-
lonitrile and three molecules of water, and the
catalysts' active center is reconstituted to its original
fully oxidized form.
The most commonly used catalysts for this reaction
are either those based on mixed metal molybdates or
mixed metal antimonates. These systems continue to
dominate the eld.
2.1.1.
Multicomponent complex mixed metal
molybdates
Over the past 20 years several generations of multi-
component molybdates have been developed, and the
compositions are becoming ever more sophisticated
and complex, giving ever better yields of the desired
acrylonitrile product. The last three catalyst genera-
tions, summarized according to their empirical for-
mulae, are presented in Table 1.
These compositions have been ne tuned for max-
imum acrylonitrile yield production in uid bed reac-
tors, the reactors of choice in commerce, and each
element contained within these compositions has its
designated function and performs accordingly.
For example, it is by now well known that the
primarily function of bismuth [1,2] in these composi-
tions is its ability to activate the surface adsorbed
propylene through the abstraction of an a-hydrogen.
The function of molybdenum is to chemisorb propy-
lene and activate the ammonia molecule by generating
chemisorbed NH-species which are capable of insert-
ing into the chemisorbed allylic intermediate, creating
the acrylonitrile precursors. The function of iron is to
serve as an efcient redox couple (Fe3/2), capable of
efcient lattice oxygen transfer to the BiOMo active
site in its 3 oxidation state. In its 2 state it is
capable of efcient dioxygen chemisorption, its reduc-
tive transformation to lattice oxygen (O2) and hence
its incorporation into the lattice.
Since it is very difcult to maintain a sufcient
number of Fe2 surface sites in an overall oxidizing
gaseous atmosphere, it is necessary to stabilize the
Fe2 state structurally. To this end divalent elements
such as Ni, Co, Mg and Mn form stable isostructural
molybdates with Fe2 molybdates, and by virtue of
Fig. 1. Generalized mechanistic cycle for alkane ammoxidation
[2].

solid solutions stabilize the Fe2 state. Thus Ni, Co,
Mg and Mn have the function of providing the host
structure for Fe2 in these multifunctional, multiphase
catalysts.
In a similar manner, Fe3 is stabilized through its
limited solubility in the a-bismuth molybdate phase,
the latter phase providing the host structure for Fe3.
The Cr3/2 is a redox couple of its own, generally,
effective at a temperature higher than that of the iron
couple. But it also acts as a structural diluent to iron
and booster of the Fe3 state in the Bi-molybdate
matrix.
The role of the alkali is to annihilate the most acidic
cracking sites of the compositions, to serve as a spacer
and contact enhancer of the two functionally distinct
but epitaxially matched catalyst phases. The two
phases are composed of the Fe3 containing cataly-
tically active a-bismuth molybdate phase and the Fe2
containing (Ni, Co, Mg, Mn) molybdate phase. These
two phases must cooperate with each other, and there-
fore, they must be in utmost proximity of each other;
they would be ineffective if remotely separated from
each other. For this reason it is of interest that the most
effective multiphase oxidation catalysts have at least
one face which is for all practical purposes epitaxially
essentially matched (principle of phase cooperation
[7]).
A schematic representation of such a phase coop-
eration between two functionally distinct phases of
typical multicomponent multiphase catalysts enumer-
ated above is shown in Fig. 2.
The necessity of having two functionally distinct
phases to attain high acrylonitrile yield efciency is
illustrated in Fig. 3 [8]. It is obvious that the Fe3
containing Bi-molybdate active phase, as well as the
Fe2 containing M2-molybdate regeneration phase,
must be present at the same time to attain high
acrylonitrile product yields.
Future trends. While a great deal has already been
achieved in the propylene ammoxidation catalysis,
there is still ample room for further improvement.
Since the process is not thermodynamically limited,
there is another 20% acrylonitrile to be conquered.
Approaches that might be fruitful towards this end
would include attempts to discover catalysts capable
of activating ammonia at lower temperatures; thus
allowing for lower temperature process operation
and hence anticipated higher acrylonitrile yields and
less byproducts caused by cracking reactions and
waste forming COx processes. Another approach
might be aimed at discovering single phases which
might be capable of accommodating the two above
described distinct catalytic functions within a single
phase, by propriciously placing these functionalities in
an ordered and optimally designed spatial arrange-
ment. There is also ample latitude left in optimizing
the texture of these complex ammoxidation catalysts.
Surely there are other approaches to be pursued to
achieve higher desired product yields and environ-
mentally more optimal product mixes.
