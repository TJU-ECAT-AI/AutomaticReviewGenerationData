CuThO oxides prepared with different atomic ratios Cu/Th 
have been tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane 
and propane. These catalysts are active and selective in 
the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and 
selectivity change with the nature of the alkane. 
INTRODUCTION 
Certain catalytic reactions such as selective hydrogenation 
and dehydrogenation are generally associated with specific prop- 
erties of the catalyst, in particular, the nature of active 
sites. The copper-based catalysts were found active in selec- 
tive diene hydrogenation 
[i] and in methanol synthesis [2]. 
Recently, supported copper on thoria catalyst have also been 
used in the latter reaction [3].

Copper-thorium oxide catalysts have been extensively char- 
acterized [4-73. The Cu 
2+ ions occupying different sites on the 
thoria surface were accessible to redox treatment at different 
temperatures. The copper(II) ion pairs obtained at high copper 
content are formed from one Cu 
2+ ion reducible by hydrogen and 
another one situated in substitutional surface sites, which 
remains intact towards this reactant agent. 
The purpose of this present work is to examine the influ- 
ence of copper content on thoria for the oxidative dehydrogena- 
tion of ethane and propane. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The CuTh oxide catalysts were obtained by calcination of 
the coprecipitated copper and thorium hydroxides at 1073 K for 
5 h in a flow of dried air. Samples with different Cu/Th atomic 
ratios were prepared. 
The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane or propane 
was carried out at 823 K in a dynamic flow microreactor atmos- 
pheric pressure using a mixture composition of 6:3:91 for C 
2 
(or C3):02:He. The total flow rate was 60 cm 
3 min 
-I. The cata- 
lyst sample weighed 0.i g. The catalyst was heated under the 
-I 
reaction mixture at a linear rate of 4.6 K min 
. The reaction 
products were quantitatively 
analyzed by two gas chromato- 
graphs. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios 
have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]. Apart from the 
substitutional sites occupied by Cu 
2+ ions both on the surface 
and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A 
1 and A 
2 signals, 
respectively, 
(Fig. la) at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other 
Cu 
2+ ions, characterized by M

2 and D signals (Fig. la), oc- 
cupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts 
(Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H

In particular, copper(II) 
ion pairs (D) 
can be formed from one copper(II) ion, reducible by hydrogen, 
and another one corresponding to substitutional surface sites 
(AI), which remains stable towards hydrogen. From Cu/Th> 0.25, 
CuO crystallites are formed on the catalyst surface, in partic- 
ular 
when the solid is treated by a redox cycle. In addition, 
the relative intensities of the above signals have been mea- 
sured for different Cu/Th ratios (Fig. ib). The A 
I and A 
2 signal 
109 
ABOUKAIS et al.: DEHYDROGENATION 
intensities reached a maximum for a low copper content (Cu/Th 
< 0.i) and disappeared rapidly before the atomic ratio reached 
0.25. This disappearance can be due to the fact that at high 
copper concentration, the formation of substitutional sites is 
not possible. The MI, M 
2 and D signal intensities seem to be 
correlated. These signals rapidly increase from Cu/Th=0.01 to 
a maximum value for Cu/Th=0.25, then a significant decrease in 
the intensities is observed. This decrease has been correlated 
with the formation of a large amount of copper oxide during the 
preparation step of the catalysts and calcination at high tem- 
peratures. 
Table la summarizes the results obtained on CuTh oxide cata- 
lysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Besides the 
desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon di- 
oxide were major products. The catalytic activity increases 
with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total con- 
version of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % 
of the products was ethylene. Pure thoria gave the weakest ac- 
tivity, only 2.4% of conversion has been detected. On the other 
side, the selectivity in ethylene increases with the copper 
content and decreases for Cu/Th > 
0.25 (Fig. 2a). 
As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are ac- 
tive and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 
Figure 2b and Table ib show clearly that the conversion 
of 
propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO 
2 
when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains 
constant for larger atomic ratios. The conversion in propene 
over the pure ThO 
2 support is slightly different from zero. On 
the other hand, the selectivity in propene increases rapidly 
with the copper content to reach a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and 
finally decreases for higher atomic ratios. 
From the above results, it is obvious that the conversion 
of ethane and propane to ethylene and propene, respectively, is 
closely correlated with the presence of copper in thoria. At 
low copper contents (Cu/Th <0.i), 
the conversion of propane 
and the selectivity in propene are more important compared to

those obtained in the case of ethane. In fact, the conversion 
of ethane and the selectivity in ethylene are significant at 
high copper concentration. 
Therefore, the nature and the copper 
site concentrations have an important role to explain this dif- 
ference in both reactions. Indeed, it has already been demon- 
strated [4-63 that the Cu 
2+ ions in thoria exist in different 
forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper 
in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and 
Cue crystallites for Cu/Th > 
0.25 ratios. Since the conversion 
of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the pres- 
ence of Cue may be responsible since its formation begins al- 
ready at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit 
the formation of ethylene. Consequently, 
the selectivity in 
ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) 
sites characterized 
by MI, M 
2 and D signals. In the case of propane, the catalytic 
activity may be due to the presence of Cu 
2+ ions on the solid

Fig. 2. Evolution of the activity and selectivity of ethane 
to ethene (a) and propane to propene (b) with the 
Cu/Th atomic ratio 
surface (MI, M 
2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites 
particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the 
conversion. Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due 
to Cu 
2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A 
1 and A 
2) 
rather than other sites. The decrease of the selectivity in 
propene when the conversion of propane increases has already 
been discussed by Kung and Volta [8, 93 for the consecutive oxi- 
dation reactions:

Supposing that the reaction is first order, the selectivity 
S in propene is given by the following equation: 
(K-l) 
K (l-C) 
[

s= (E-l) C 
where K=kl/k 
2 is the coefficient of selectivity, k 
I and k 
2 are 
the rate constants of dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation 
of propene, respectively, 
and C the conversion of propane. In 
our case the highest value of K has been estimated at 0.033 for 
Cu/Th=0.1. This value is weak compared to those obtained on 
other catalysts as V-Mg-O and V205/TiO 2 where it is equal 9o 0.17 
and 0.14 respectively [8, 9]. 
CONCLUSION 
The CuThO oxide prepared at different Cu/Th atomic ratios 
and calcined at 1073 K under a flow of dry air are poor cata- 
lysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. 
The activity and the selectivity of these catalysts change 
toward the nature of reacting agents.

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
