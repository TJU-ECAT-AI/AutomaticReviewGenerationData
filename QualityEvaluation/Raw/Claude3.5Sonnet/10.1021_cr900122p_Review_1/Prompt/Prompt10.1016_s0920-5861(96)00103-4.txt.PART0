Molecular design of active sites in partial oxidation reactions on 
metallic oxides

Abstract 
Though a variety of examples, it is shown that the catalytic oxidation reactions which operate via a Mars and van 
Krevelen mechanism imply ensembles of atoms containing variable valence cations and Lewis bases such as O 2-, OH- or 
PO43- able to act in the different elementary steps. The structure and the size of these ensembles, defined as 'inorganic oxide 
molecular clusters', determine their reactional specificity. The examples chosen show that the 'designs' of such ensembles 
are strongly dependent on the nature of the material, on their morphology (structure sensitivity as for MOO3, vanadyl 
phosphates), and on their structure (vanadyl phosphates, iron phosphates). It is also possible to build such ensembles upon 
dispersion of an active oxide on an inert support (MoO3/SiO2, V2OJTiO2).

1. Introduction 
Oxidation catalytic reactions are of prime 
importance at an industrial level and correspond 
to a huge market. For instance in the US in 
1994, about 31% of the catalytic production of 
major organic chemicals corresponded to oxida- 
tion catalytic processes (18% heterogeneous, 
13% homogeneous) and 18% to oxychlorina- 
tion. The market corresponds to 20 billions US 
$ in the USA and world wide such numbers 
have roughly to be multiplied by a factor of 2.5. 
The concepts of oxidation began with 
Lavoisier's disproving of the phlogiston theory 
in 1773. One usually defines two groups of 
reactions namely homolytic and heterolytic. The 
first type involves radicals formed by homolytic

cleavage of interatomic bonds. The second type 
involves an active oxygen compound or a metal 
ion which oxidizes the starting material in a two 
electrons transfer reaction. The reduced oxidiz- 
ing agent must be reoxidized in a second step. 
Majority of the catalysts correspond to metal- 
lic oxides with V or Mo as one of the key 
elements but also cations of variable oxidation 
states as Fe3+/Fe2+; VS+/V 3+, Mo6+/Mo 5+, 
Cr6+/Cr 
3+, Cu2+/fu+, Sb3+/SbS+, etc. Some 
metals (mainly Ag for ethylene epoxidation), 
noble metals (as Pt, Pd for total oxidation, etc) 
zeolites (titano silicalite TS-1 from ENI for 
phenol oxidation) and heteropolyoxometallates 
(e.g. H4PMolaVO40 for isobutene oxidation to 
methacrolein) may also be used. 
In majority of cases catalytic properties in 
oxidation reactions involve a redox mechanism 
between reactant molecules and surface active

the lattice. The mechanism involves the pres- 
ence of two types of distinct active sites: an 
active cationic site which oxidises the substrate 
and another site active for dioxygen reduction. 
An adequate structure of the material should 
also facilitate both electrons and oxygen species 
transfer.

2.2. Oxygen species 
sites as represented in Fig. 1 as suggested by 
Mars and van Krevelen in 1953. Such a mecha- 
nism necessitates a catalyst which contains a 
redox couple as for instance transition metal 
ions and which exhibits high electrical conduc- 
tivity to favour electron transfer and at last 
which has a high lattice oxygen anion mobility 
within the material to insure the reoxidation of 
the reduced catalyst. 
From this feature arises the idea that the 
active sites are not isolated ions as in the Tay- 
lor's model but rather an ensemble of ions in a 
kind of 'inorganic oxide cluster'. A molecular 
concept of the active sites has then to be de- 
fined. Several examples are chosen below to 
show how such a concept may be valid in 
oxidation reaction and how it can be determin- 
ing for the choice of the metallic oxide and/or 
of its preparation procedure. 
2. General features of oxidation catalysts and 
oxidation reaction 
2.1. Oxidation catalysts 
The oxidation catalysts are usually mixed 
oxides which operate according to the redox 
process suggested by Mars and van Krevelen 
(Fig. 1). According to this mechanism the sub- 
strate is oxidized by the solid and not directly 
by molecular oxygen of the gaseous phase. The 
r61e of dioxygen is to regenerate or maintain the 
oxidized state of the catalyst. The oxygen species 
introduced in the substrate (or giving H20 for 
oxidative dehydrogenation reactions) stems from 
The oxygen atom incorporated into the sub- 
strate stems from the lattice and is at - 2 oxida- 
tion state. Its replacement by molecular oxygen 
necessitates electrons according to: 0 2 + 4e----> 
20 2- . This process has its own kinetics related 
to the reactivity of the sites with oxygen, their 
concentration, the efficiency of electron trans- 
fer, the partial pressure of oxygen, etc. Usually, 
it is much faster that the oxidation of the sub- 
strate, i.e. it is generally admitted that the rate 
determining step is the substrate activation. 
Let us take some examples which will be 
considered in more detail later on (Scheme 1). 
It clearly appears that a single and isolated 
metallic ion site cannot take into account all the 
necessary transformations involved in the reac- 
tion since several steps as replenishing of oxy- 
gen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and 
electrons transfer are concerned. For instance 
n-butane oxidation reaction to maleic anhydride 
necessitates 7 lattice oxide ions, 8 hydrogen

atoms abstraction from the substrate, 3 oxygen 
atoms insertion and 14 electrons transfer! 
The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond 
in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal 
ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to 
the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a 
concerted action with homolytic breaking of 
metal-oxygen bond which transfers one elec- 
tron to the metal. Without any hypothesis about 
the nature of the metal-oxygen bond one can 
write with formation of a w-alkyl complex (as 
usually admitted) or a 8-alkyl complex. 
Depending on the nature, oxidation state of 
the metal ion and its environment (coordination 
structure), the metal-oxygen bonds may be more 
or less polarized and therefore the oxygen ion 
may exhibit electrophilic or nucleophilic proper- 
ties. One may distinguish three extreme cases:

Each case corresponds to specific properties. 
Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will inter- 
vene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the 
double bond or of aromatic ring. 
Case (b) (weakly polarized) will favor con- 
certed homolytic-type reaction as for allylic de- 
hydrogenation of olefins. 
Case (c) (electrophilic character) allows one 
a direct attack of a double bond (oxidative 
breaking). 
3. Structure sensitivity of oxidation reactions 
on oxides 
Such a concept has been introduced by 
Boudart on metals. It has been introduced for 
oxides in the late seventies by Volta et al. [ 1 
], or 
early eighties by Tatibouet and Germain [2], 
Haber et al. [3], etc and it is widely accepted at 
present. For instance in the work by Volta et al., 
it was shown that single crystal type samples of 
MoO 3 exhibiting different relative amounts of 
the different faces (010) basal, (100) side and 
(101) and (10-1) apical exhibited different activ- 
ity and selectivity in the oxidation of propene to 
acrolein and CO 
x [4]. The originality of the 
work was to synthesize crystals of various 
shapes by epitaxial growth via oxyhydrolysis of 
MoC15 inserted between the layers of graphite. 
Table 1 summarizes the main results obtained 
for propene, but-l-ene and isobutene oxidation 
on MoO 3 crystals. It clearly appears that for 
propene oxidation the (100) face is selective for 
acrolein formation and the (010) for total oxida- 
tion. Such specificity depends on the hydrocar- 
bon molecule. It may thus be proposed that the 
stereochemitry of the hydrocarbon molecule 
and that of the oxide face play a determining 
role. 
A more precise analysis and characterization 
of the MoO 3 crystallites shape have shown that 
in fact the better plane for propene oxidation to 
acrolein corresponds to the (lk0) plane as shown 
in Fig. 2 [5]. It is then suggested that the 
propene activation (H abstraction) into the w-al-

lyl intermediate occurs on the side (100) plane 
while the O atom insertion occurs on the (010) 
basal plane. Due to the layered structure of 
MoO 3, the lattice oxide ions are much more 
labile in the (0k0) plane than in the others. 
Recently, such a structure sensitivity was de- 
rived for the partial oxidation of methane to 
formadehyde [6]. 
4. Vanadyl pyrophosphate [7] 
Such a catalyst is well known for the oxida- 
tion of n-butane into maleic anhydride. The 
preparation 
necessitates 
the 
formation 
of 
VOPO 4 • 0.5H20 as a precursor synthesized in 
an aqueous or better in an organic medium and 
its activation in a flow of 1 to 2% butane in air 
at the reaction temperature (ca. 380C). 
Here too, the preparation and the activation 
of the samples appeared also to be particularly 
crucial in order to obtain a well performing 
catalyst. In all cases, whatever the catalysts 
being 
good 
or 
exceptionally 
good, 
the 
(VO)2P207 phase (V 4 cations) as a main con- 
stituent was detected by X-ray diffraction and 
by in situ laser Raman spectroscopy [8] in addi- 
tion to small amounts of some 
VOPO 4 phases 
(V 5+ cations) as all, [3, / or . Moreover, 
VOPO 
4 pure phases were observed to be active 
and selective although to a lesser extent. It 
turned out that the presence of some V 5+ cations 
on the V 4 catalyst surface of (VO)2P207 was 
necessary although an excess was observed to 
be detrimental. Moreover the catalyst surface 
was observed to be richer in P than the bulk by 
a ratio of about 2. 
The (100) face of (VO)2P207 corresponding 
to edge sharing dimers of VO 
6 octahedra bonded 
to the following chain by PO 
4 tetrahedra was 
shown to be the active and selective face [9]. 
One has one oxygen of V = O bond pointing 
away from the surface and the second one point- 
ing downward in the form of a dimer as 
schematized in Fig. 3. 
In a recent paper Grasselli et al. [10] pro- 
posed a mechanism with activated 0 2- (per- 
oxo) species on unsaturated V ion at the surface 
and have proposed that the active site is com- 
posed of an ensemble of four dimers isolated 
one from the other by excess of phosphate 
species as schematised in Fig. 3. Note that if 
such an assumption is true it is hard to under- 
stand how such activated oxygen species may 
be stable at high temperature and to understand 
the moving bed technology recently developed 
by the Du Pont researchers [ 
11]. At variance the 
concept of four dimers as an active site seems 
reasonable and coherent with the scheme pro- 
posed by Ziolkowski [12] and Bordes [13].

5. Iron phosphates and hydroxyphosphates 
[14-17] 
Such catalysts appeared to be potentially im- 
portant catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogena- 
tion of isobutyric acid (IBA) to methacrylic acid 
(MAA). This reaction is important as a first step 
to form methyl methacrylate monomer used for 
plexiglass or altuglass formation by polymerisa- 
tion. The industrial type catalyst contains iron 
hydroxyphosphate of uncertain nature and Cs or 
NH 4 as additive and unfortunately necessitates 
a large amount of water in the feed (namely 10 
to 12 mol H20 per mol of IBA) to remain 
stable with time on steam. This makes this 
process difficult to be developed industrially. 
Taking into account the phase diagram Fe203- 
FeO-P205 it could be possible to select and 
study several phases which contain Fe 2+, Fe 3+ 
or both cations able to insure the redox mecha- 
nism necessary for the reaction to take place as 
it was shown to proceed via a Mars and van 
Krevelen mechanism [18]. It was shown that the 
active phase was a phosphate with iron ion at a 
two oxidation states + 2 and + 3, ctFe3(P207) 2, 
composed of trimers of face sharing FeO 
6 octa- 
hedra (as schematized in Fig. 4a) separated one 
from the other by PO 
4 tetrahedra. The active 
sites were shown to correspond to a group of 
two trimers facing each other on their respective

The way the octahedra are connected to each

has been shown that the other polymorphic form 
of Fe3(P207)

active and selective. In this phase, the central

A study of iron hydroxyphosphates exhibit- 
ing clusters of face sharing FeO 
6 octahedra of 
different sizes has been carried out. It turns out 
that all catalysts were belonging after catalytic 
testing to the same solid solution of the type 
F3+ 1-- 2+(PO4)3(OH)3_3xO3 x with 0 < x < 1 
e4_xt'e3x 
_ 
_ 
(Fig. 5). Depending upon their composition these 
phases contain clusters of different sizes ranging 
from dimers (Fe4(POa)3(OH) 3 to continuous 
chains (Fe2(PO4)O). The results showed that 
all samples were active and selective for the 
reaction even for the different sizes of the clus- 
ters but the optimum activity and selectivity 
were observed for the phase Fe3(PO4)2(OH) 2 
called barbosalite and containing limited size 
clusters, namely trimers as schematized in Fig. 
4a. The added water plays a role as for the 
active phase of the industrial catalyst in stabiliz- 
ing the hydroxylated catalysts and the redox 
couple is the same but implies O/OH instead of 
POa/PO3OH couple. 
In a theoretical study using extended Htickel 
molecular orbital calculation it has been shown 
that for iron octahedra assembled as dimers 
[19], trimers [20] or larger clusters there may 
occur electron exchange between Fe 
2 
+ and Fe 
3 
+ 
cations. This occurs in the case of trimers but

neither 
for 
dimers 
nor 
for 
trimers 
in 
Fe3(PeOT)e (Fig. 6). This electron exchange 
between iron cations very probably favors the 
redox mechanism and thus the catalytic proper- 
ties but should be limited to the closest neigh- 
bouts to give the best performing catalysts. 
Such clusters of FeO 
6 octahedra also exist in 
other inorganic compounds. For instance they 
exist in ilvaite (CaFe 
3 
+ 
FeZ2 
 
Si207OOH) where 
silicate layers replace phosphate anions and FeO 
6 
octahedra form ribbons. It is interesting to note 
that such material is active and selective for the 
reaction although to a lesser extent than the 
previous hydroxyphosphates [21]. The lower 
catalytic behaviour may be due to the presence 
of Ca 
2+ cations in the structure and/or to the 
silicate counter anion whose basicity in the 
sense of Pearson is different from that of the 
phosphate anion and/or the infinite size of 
FeO 
6 octahedra clusters. 
The main idea one may keep in mind from 
this study is that inorganic clusters of iron octa- 
hedra with iron at two oxidation states are ac- 
tive for the reaction studied and that one has to 
consider the active sites as these clusters, pref- 
erentially as ensemble of two trimers although 
other sizes (dimers, tetramers, pentamers...) 
are also active and selective but to a lesser 
extent. The iron oxidation state is changing 
during the reaction in a similar way that the 
va/v 5 redox couple on VPO catalysts (vide 
supra, Section 4). This again shows that metallic 
oxides have to be considered with a dynamical 
view during the oxidation reaction. 
6. Supported oxide catalysts 
Supports are very often used in catalysis for 
several reasons, namely: 
(i) Dispersion of the active phase in order to 
increase the surface to volume ratio since het- 
erogeneous catalysis is occurring at the solid 
surface. 
(ii) Heat transfer: this is a particularly impor-

9 
tant aspect in oxidation reactions because of the 
high exothermicity involved. This holds particu- 
larly true at industrial scale since the hot spot 
problem is very crucial and should be monitored 
with precision within a few degrees to avoid 
local overactivity and subsequently overheating 
and presumably irreversible phase transforma- 
tion of the catalyst. 
(iii) Attrition: this aspect is of main impor- 
tance for fluidized or solid transported beds. 
One very usually uses silica or carborundum as 
a binder or as a coating to limit attrition. 
(iv) Formation of new catalytic sites: this 
point will be emphasised below in some exam- 
ples. One will see that well dispersed species of 
limited size could be formed and exhibit pecu- 
liar catalytic properties. 
(v) Modification of the active phase proper- 
ties due to its chemical interaction with the 
support, including epitaxial induced modifica- 
tions. In some cases the chemical effect of the 
support will be determining for catalytic proper- 
ties. For example several oxides (V20 s, MoO 3, 
Re2OT, CrO3...) deposited on several oxide 
supports (SiO 2, TiO 
2, A1203) were shown by 
Wachs et al. [22] to exhibit very different cat- 
alytic properties in methanol oxidation reactions 
as summarized in Table 2. 
6.1. Molybdenum oxide supported on silica 
Different procedures may be used such as 
impregnation of silica with a molybdate salt or 
grafting molybdenum chloride or molybdenum 
based organometallic compounds such as Mo

carbonyls on to the hydroxyl groups of silica or 
solid-solid reaction between MoO 3 and SiO 
2 at 
temperatures near or above 500C. 
An important parameter for the impregnation 
method is the pH of the molybdate solution. As 
a matter of fact the following equilibrium has 
been well established: 
MovO64 + 4HzO , 7MoO 
2- + 8H + 
The monomeric tetrahedral MoO4 
z- species 
is favored at higher pH and vice versa for the 
polymeric heptamolybdate anion. Moreover one 
defines the so-called isoelectric point of the 
support (ieps) or zero point charge (zpc) of a 
support by the pH value for which the surface 
charge turns from anionic to cationic, i.e. will 
allow cations or anions from the liquid phase to 
be adsorbed, respectively. One has values of 2 
for silica, 5-6 for titania, 8 for alumina, etc. 
This clearly shows that the size of the adsorbed 
anion (monomeric or polymeric) adsorbed on a 
support will depend on the ieps (zpc) value, i.e. 
on the support itself. Above the ieps value, the 
surface of a particular oxide is negatively 
charged and vice versa below. The anion will 
thus be adsorbed for a pH value below the ieps 
value and as said above a lower pH value will 
favor polymolybdate anionic species. 
In a study of ammonium heptamolybdate im- 
pregnated silica [23], the molybdenum loading 
was varied up to about 20 wt%. The hydroxyl 
groups of the silica were observed by infrared 
and/or UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies to decrease 
in intensity with Mo loading and to disappear at 
7 wt% Mo loading while two UV bands were 
appearing at 245 and 340 nm. The former band 
may be assigned to tetrahedral monomeric 
species and the latter one to octahedral poly- 
meric (polymolybdate) species. The former band 
was observed to increase in intensity propor- 
tionally to Mo loading at low Mo loading and to 
saturate at roughly 3 wt% Mo. The latter band 
was observed to appear near 2 wt% Mo, to 
increase proportionally to Mo content up to 7 
wt% Mo and then to decrease slowly with Mo 
loading.

The formation of the former species was

Catalytic properties were studied for two re- 
actions; namely isopropanol conversion and 
propene partial oxidation. The first reaction is a 
test reaction which allows the characterization 
of the acidic, basic or redox properties of a 
catalyst. One gets dehydration to propene or 
di-isopropylether for an acid catalyst, acetone 
for a basic catalyst in the absence of air and 
acetone and water for a redox type catalyst in 
the presence of air. The experimental results at 
100C clearly show that at low Mo loadings 
acidic features are favored while redox features 
are favored at higher loadings. This indicates 
that monomeric MoO 
2- species are acidic (pre- 
sumably as in silicomolybdic acid) while poly- 
meric species exhibit redox properties (see Fig. 
7). 
The second reaction studied is propene oxida- 
tion at 380C (see Fig. 8). Weak activity was 
observed for low Mo loading. At higher Mo 
loading propanal was the major product while 
acrolein was also observed. At very high Mo 
loadings and for MoO 3 one gets almost exclu-

sively acrolein. Propanal is known to stem from 
propene by an electrophilic attack while acrolein 
corresponds rather to a nucleophilic attack. 
These results indicate that monomeric MoO 
2- 
species does not oxidize propene in our condi- 
tions while polymeric (polymolybdate) species 
exhibit redox properties, with 0 2- species be- 
ing rather electrophilic. Molybdenum oxide ex- 
hibits redox properties with 0 2- species being 
rather nucleophilic. One can thus realise how 
the size of the active site is important in oxida- 
tion catalysis. This is typical of structure sensi- 
tive reaction.

Such a catalyst is well known for several 
reactions, such as o-xylene oxidation to phthalic 
anhydride and selective catalytic reduction 
(SCR) of NO by ammonia. The anatase form of 
TiO 
2 appears to be better than the rutile form. 
Such catalysts with 1 and 8 wt% V2Os/anatase 
was prepared by RhSne-Poulenc (S  10 m 2 
g-1) for an exercise of characterization by 25 
different European laboratories. All results are 
assembled in a special issue of Catalysis Today 
published in May 1994, Vol. 20, no. 1. Surface 
vanadium species were observed to exist in 
three different forms: monomeric VO43- species, 
polymeric vanadate species and V205 crystal-

lites [24], the relative amount of which de- 
pended on initial at % V2Os/anatase and on the 
subsequent selective dissolution treatment. 
The following conclusions could be drawn 
considering that a polyvanadate species occu- 
pies a ca circular zone of a diameter of 0.38 nm 
per V atom (i.e. 0.165 nm 
2) and an isolated 
monovanadate species 0.66 nm per V atom (i.e. 
0.43 nm2): 
(i) Monomeric VO 
3- species exhibit acidic 
character with OH groups (BriSnsted acidity) 
and result in propene formation for isopropanol 
conversion and in total oxidation for o-xylene 
oxidation. Maximum coverage equals 0.43 wt% 
V205. 
(ii) Polyvanadate surface species exhibit re- 
dox properties, namely give rise to acetone for 
isopropanol conversion and phthalic anhydride 
for o-xylene oxidation. 
(iii) V205 crystallites exhibit low activity for 
o-xylene conversion and high selectivity in total 
oxidation. 
6.3. Various oxides deposited on different oxide 
supports 
The idea is here to determine how a support 
may modify the catalytic properties of the dif- 
ferent oxide species (as inorganic clusters of 
different size). It has been described above how 
the size of the deposited oxide species (mono- 
meric, polymeric, bulk-type) results in different 
catalytic properties. 
Vanadium oxide has been deposited on sev- 
eral supports as silica, alumina, titania but also 
zirconia, niobia, zirconium hydroxyphosphate, 
etc. Its reductibility was studied by reduction by 
hydrogen at 400C. It was observed that V on 
TiO 2 and /-A120 3 was reduced rather fast and 
one reached a consumption such as an O/V 
atomic ratio near to 1 for TiO 2 and 0.65 for 
A1203 [25]. At variance for silica the reduction 
was much slower and an O/V ratio of 0.57 was 
obtained. Such differences were interpreted by 
the authors as due to different species on the 
surface: mainly monomeric VO43- species for 
TiO z, dimeric species Vz 
O4- for /-A1203 (23) 
and V205 crystallites for silica [26]. 
The size of the polyvanadate species in solu- 
tion corresponds to V3093-, V402 with tetrahe- 
drally coordinated V at pH = 7 and 4.5 respec- 
tively and V10068 
- or V10028H 5- with octahe- 
drally coordinated V at pH = 2.5. Deposition of 
such polyvanadates of different sizes was per- 
formed carefully on "y-A1203 support and their 
initial structures depicted above were shown to 
remain stable even after calcination in flowing 
air at 500C and to be only partly modified after 
catalytic reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation 
of propane in the 350 to 450C range. Moreover 
in such cases, the selectivity towards propene 
was observed to be the same at the same con- 
version level, indicating that in this size domain 
of polyvanadate species the catalytic selectivity 
was not changed, only the activity was observed 
to increase with vanadium loading [27]. 
In a study of VO 2+ and Cr 3+ cations ex- 
changed or impregnated on the surface of zirco- 
nium hydrogenophosphates and compared to 
vanadyl pyrophosphate and chromium(III) phos- 
phate, the best catalytic properties for ethane to 
ethylene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction at 
500C were observed when the material present 
either continuous chains of vanadyl or CrO 
6 
octahedra as in (VO)2P207 and a CrPO 
4 re- 
spectively or chains of limited size [28]. By 
comparison with bulk oxides exhibiting similar 
environment, it was suggested as for supported 
VO and CrO 
x species on zirconium hy- 
drogenophosphates that the catalytic perfor- 
mances were related to the stronger basic char- 
acter of PO 
3- anions with respect to 0 2- an- 
ions. 
7. Conclusions 
Some general conclusions may be drawn from 
this general presentation: 
(i) Oxidation reactions in gas-phase heteroge- 
neous catalysis usually proceed via Mars and 
van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. involve lattice 
12 
J.C. Vedrine et al. / Catalysis Today 33 (1997) 3-13 
oxygen ions. Such ions exhibit an electrophilic 
or a nucleophilic character and therefore present 
different catalytic properties since the elec- 
trophilic oxygen interacts with a double bond or 
an aromatic ring while the nucleophilic oxygen 
interacts with a C-H bond in o of the double 
bond or of an aromatic ring. 
(ii) Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive 
and therefore greatly depend on the local and 
surface structure of the oxide catalysts. A pecu- 
liar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid 
surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be 
obtained to get the best catalyst. Parameters 
such as reducibility and reoxidability features of 
the oxides are very important for catalytic reac- 
tions. 
(iii) Active sites for oxidation reactions ap- 
pear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of 
metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influ- 
ences the catalytic properties. In some examples 
the number of atoms constituting the active sites 
could be established. For instance double trimers 
of face sharing FeO 
6 octahedra are particularly 
active and selective for oxidative dehydrogena- 
tion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on 
iron hydroxyphosphates; ensembles of four 
dimers of VO 
6 octahedra are suggested to be the 
active sites for butane oxidation to maleic anhy- 
dride in vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts. 
Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- 
exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation 
properties. At variance low size polymeric 
species exhibit better selectivity for many par- 
tial oxidation reactions than large size species or 
bulk-type oxide. It is thus clear that the size of 
these 'inorganic molecular ensembles' as active 
sites is important depending on the reaction 
considered and the support used. The characteri- 
zation of such 'clusters' lying on the surface is 
rather difficult and the above statements for 
supported oxide catalysts are only qualitative. 
To better characterize such clusters, techniques 
as XANES (sensitive to local symmetry type), 
EXAFS (sensitive to the coordination number 
and nearby element distances) and radial elec- 
tron distribution (RED) of X-ray diffraction 
peaks (sensitive to the nearby element dis- 
tances) have to be used. Already data have been 
obtained for MoO 3 and V205 deposited on SiO 
2, 
A1203 or TiO 
2 support. This holds true only if 
one has one type of cluster species to analyse. 
The reader interested may read a chapter de- 
voted to XANES and EXAFS techniques by 
Moraweck in the book by Imelik and Vdrine 
(1988 and 1994) ([29,30]). 
(iv) Oxidation catalysts have to be considered 
with a dynamic view under reaction conditions. 
This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen 
mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide 
lattice. This latter phenomenon results from the 
wetting effect particularly for multicomponent 
and supported oxide catalysts. It follows that for 
many catalysts a certain time on stream is nec- 
essary before the catalyst reaches its steady 
state. It is frequent that in an industrial plant a 
steady state is reached only after one or two 
hundreds hours, the catalysts lasting several 
years before having to be replaced. For simple 
catalysts as doped vanadyl pyrophosphates used 
for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride the 
right size of the active sites (e.g. tetramers of 
vanadyl dimers) is monitored by the reactants in 
catalytic reaction conditions leading to the right 
VS+/V 4+ ratio, by the preparation procedure to 
change the material morphology (the (100) face 
of (VO)2P20 7 being developed), and by the 
adequate addition of additive elements which 
regulate the site size and VS+/V 4+ ion ratio. 
The view of an oxidation catalyst as dynamical 
under catalytic reaction conditions is essential 
for our understanding of its functioning.
