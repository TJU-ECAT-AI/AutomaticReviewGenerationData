The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study focuses on Cr(III)silica catalysts, which are believed to be the most active for dehydrogenation.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The research explores CH activation by oxidative addition as a potential route to catalytic dehydrogenation. This mechanism is possible on DeRossi-type species, where CrOH moieties are bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges.

However, the process faces several challenges:

1. High activation energy: The initial CH activation step has a computed activation energy of 160 kJ/mol.

2. Instability of intermediates: The ethylhydridochromium complex formed is unstable and prone to reductive elimination, necessitating an immediate subsequent step.

3. Overall high activation energy: The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is comparable to that of -bond metathesis on unstrained three-bridge species, which is considered high.

4. Competing mechanisms: Other mechanisms, such as CH activation by -bond metathesis on a hydridochromium(III) species, show lower activation energies (<100 kJ/mol) and may be more favorable.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The study compares different models (two-bridge and three-bridge) of chromium sites on the silica surface. The results suggest that the structure and binding of the chromium species to the surface significantly influence the reaction mechanism and energy barriers.

In conclusion, while CH activation by oxidative addition is possible on certain Cr(III)silica catalysts, it appears to be an unlikely route for efficient catalytic dehydrogenation due to high energy barriers and competing, more favorable mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms, and energy barriers in designing effective ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。这项研究主要关注Cr(III)硅胶催化剂，被认为是脱氢反应中活性最高的催化剂。

ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。研究探索了通过氧化加成进行CH活化作为催化脱氢的潜在途径。这种机理在DeRossi型物种上是可能的，其中CrOH部分通过两个氧桥与表面结合。

然而，该过程面临几个挑战：

1. 高活化能：初始CH活化步骤的计算活化能为160 kJ/mol。

2. 中间体不稳定：形成的乙基氢化铬复合物不稳定，容易发生还原消除，需要立即进行后续步骤。

3. 总体高活化能：基于氧化加成的脱氢总体活化能与非应变三桥物种上的-键复分解相当，被认为是较高的。

4. 竞争机理：其他机理，如在氢化铬(III)物种上通过-键复分解进行CH活化，显示出较低的活化能（<100 kJ/mol），可能更有利。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。研究比较了硅胶表面上铬位点的不同模型（双桥和三桥）。结果表明，铬物种与表面的结构和结合方式显著影响反应机理和能量障碍。

总之，虽然在某些Cr(III)硅胶催化剂上通过氧化加成进行CH活化是可能的，但由于高能量障碍和存在更有利的竞争机理，它似乎不太可能成为有效的催化脱氢途径。这项研究强调了在设计有效的ODH过程中，理解催化剂结构、反应机理和能量障碍之间相互作用的重要性。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst types, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. Based on the provided literature:

1. Catalysts: The study focuses on Cr-oxide systems, particularly Cr(III)-silica catalysts. These supported systems have been researched since 1933, with Cr(III) considered the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The paper investigates CH activation through oxidative addition as a potential route for alkane dehydrogenation. This mechanism involves direct binding of carbon and hydrogen to the metal as the CH bond breaks. Other mechanisms mentioned include electrophilic addition (σ-bond metathesis) and β-hydrogen transfer.

3. Challenges in selectivity and conversion: The complexity of the catalyst surface makes it difficult to fully understand the active site and reaction mechanism. This uncertainty poses challenges for achieving high selectivity and conversion.

4. Site isolation: The study uses various surface models, including cluster models constructed both ad hoc and systematically from silica crystal surfaces. This approach helps in understanding the role of site isolation in the reaction process.

5. Process efficiency: The research shows that CH activation by oxidative addition on Cr(III)-silica catalysts has a high activation energy (160 kJ/mol for the initial step), making it an unlikely route for efficient catalytic dehydrogenation. The overall activation energy for this mechanism is comparable to that of σ-bond metathesis on three-bridge species.

In conclusion, while oxidative addition was investigated as a potential mechanism for ODH, the high activation energy and complexity of the process suggest that it may not be the most efficient route for Cr(III)-silica catalysts. The study highlights the importance of understanding different reaction mechanisms and catalyst structures to improve the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

1. 催化剂：该研究主要关注Cr-氧化物系统，特别是Cr(III)-硅催化剂。这些负载型系统自1933年以来一直是研究对象，其中Cr(III)被认为是脱氢反应中最活跃的氧化态。

2. 反应机理：该论文研究了通过氧化加成进行CH活化作为烷烃脱氢的潜在途径。这种机制涉及碳和氢直接与金属结合，同时CH键断裂。其他提到的机制包括亲电加成（σ-键复分解）和β-氢转移。

3. 选择性和转化率的挑战：催化剂表面的复杂性使得完全理解活性位点和反应机理变得困难。这种不确定性给实现高选择性和转化率带来了挑战。

4. 位点隔离：该研究使用了各种表面模型，包括通过特殊方法和系统地从二氧化硅晶体表面构建的簇模型。这种方法有助于理解位点隔离在反应过程中的作用。

5. 过程效率：研究表明，在Cr(III)-硅催化剂上通过氧化加成进行CH活化的活化能较高（初始步骤为160 kJ/mol），这使得它不太可能成为高效催化脱氢的途径。这种机制的总活化能与三桥物种上的σ-键复分解相当。

总之，虽然氧化加成被研究作为ODH的潜在机制，但高活化能和过程的复杂性表明它可能不是Cr(III)-硅催化剂最有效的途径。该研究强调了理解不同反应机理和催化剂结构对提高ODH过程整体效率的重要性。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. This study focuses on Cr(III)silica catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation.

Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are evident from the instability of intermediates. The ethylhydridochromium(V) product formed after CH activation is unstable and prone to back-reaction, necessitating immediate -hydrogen transfer to complete the dehydrogenation cycle.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves several steps:
1. CH activation by oxidative addition
2. Stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex
3. -hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand, releasing H2
4. Desorption of ethene, regenerating the catalyst

The process efficiency is influenced by the activation energies of these steps and the stability of intermediates. The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation for the rate-determining step (stereochemical rearrangement) are high (220 and 350 kJ/mol, respectively), suggesting this mechanism may not be favorable for catalytic dehydrogenation.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The study shows that Cr(III) sites linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges (DeRossi-type sites) support the proposed mechanism, while sites with three oxygen bridges do not form stable ethylhydridochromium(V) intermediates, excluding CH activation by oxidative addition.

Overall, this research suggests that while oxidative addition is possible on certain Cr(III)silica sites, it may not be the most efficient route for catalytic dehydrogenation due to high activation energies and unstable intermediates. Alternative mechanisms, such as CH activation by -bond metathesis on hydridochromium(III) species, appear more promising for achieving higher process efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机制之间的复杂相互作用。本研究重点关注Cr(III)硅胶催化剂对乙烷脱氢的作用。

在实现高选择性和高转化率方面的挑战从中间体的不稳定性可见一斑。CH活化后形成的乙基氢化铬(V)产物不稳定且容易发生逆反应，需要立即进行β-氢转移以完成脱氢循环。

提出的反应机制包括几个步骤：
1. 通过氧化加成进行CH活化
2. 乙基氢化铬(V)络合物的立体化学重排
3. β-氢转移到氢化物配体，释放H2
4. 乙烯脱附，再生催化剂

过程效率受这些步骤的活化能和中间体稳定性的影响。计算得出的速率决定步骤（立体化学重排）的活化焓和自由能很高（分别为220和350 kJ/mol），表明这种机制可能不利于催化脱氢。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。研究表明，通过两个氧桥连接到硅胶表面的Cr(III)位点（DeRossi型位点）支持所提出的机制，而具有三个氧桥的位点不形成稳定的乙基氢化铬(V)中间体，排除了通过氧化加成进行CH活化的可能性。

总的来说，这项研究表明，虽然氧化加成在某些Cr(III)硅胶位点上是可能的，但由于高活化能和不稳定的中间体，它可能不是催化脱氢的最有效途径。其他机制，如在氢化铬(III)物种上通过σ-键复分解进行CH活化，似乎更有希望实现更高的过程效率。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature primarily focuses on Cr-oxide systems as catalysts for short alkane dehydrogenation, with chromium(III) considered the most active oxidation state.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complexity of the catalyst surface and the uncertainty surrounding the active site and reaction mechanism. The main focus has been on CH activation through direct interaction with chromium.

Two primary reaction mechanisms are discussed: oxidative addition and electrophilic addition (also known as σ-bond metathesis). The study investigates whether CH activation by oxidative addition is a viable route for alkane dehydrogenation.

The research shows that CH activation by oxidative addition is possible on DeRossi-type species (CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges), with an activation energy of 160 kJ/mol for the initial step. However, the overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is relatively high, comparable to the σ-bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species.

Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues, as evidenced by the discussion of different chromium sites (two-bridge vs. three-bridge models) and their impact on the reaction mechanism.

The study concludes that CH activation by oxidative addition is unlikely to be an efficient route for catalytic dehydrogenation of Cr(III)-silica catalysts. This suggests that other mechanisms, such as σ-bond metathesis or alternative catalyst systems, may be more promising for improving process efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献主要关注Cr-氧化物系统作为短链烷烃脱氢的催化剂，其中三价铬被认为是最活跃的氧化态。

在实现高选择性和高转化率方面的挑战与催化剂表面的复杂性以及活性位点和反应机理的不确定性有关。主要焦点一直是通过与铬的直接相互作用来活化CH键。

文中讨论了两种主要的反应机理：氧化加成和亲电加成（也称为σ-键复分解）。该研究探讨了通过氧化加成活化CH键是否是烷烃脱氢的可行途径。

研究表明，在DeRossi类型的物种（通过两个氧桥键合到表面的CrOH部分）上，通过氧化加成进行CH活化是可能的，初始步骤的活化能为160 kJ/mol。然而，基于氧化加成的脱氢总活化能相对较高，与无应变三桥物种上的σ-键复分解反应相当。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用，这从不同铬位点（双桥模型vs三桥模型）及其对反应机理的影响的讨论中可以看出。

研究得出结论，通过氧化加成进行CH活化不太可能成为Cr(III)-硅胶催化剂催化脱氢的有效途径。这表明，其他机制（如σ-键复分解）或替代催化剂系统可能更有希望提高烷烃氧化脱氢过程的效率。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study focuses on Cr(III)silica catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane.

Catalysts: The research primarily examines Cr(III)silica catalysts, with chromium(III) considered the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are investigated, with particular attention to DeRossi-type species where CrOH moieties are bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges.

Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion: The main challenge lies in the high activation energy required for the oxidative addition mechanism. The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are approximately 220 and 350 kJ mol^-1, respectively, which are considered quite high for efficient catalysis.

Proposed reaction mechanisms: The study focuses on the oxidative addition mechanism for C-H bond activation. This mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium, with most of the C-H bond activation occurring on the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III), while the transition state and product are on the doublet energy surface. The mechanism includes several steps: (i) oxidative addition of ethane followed by immediate stereochemical rearrangement, (ii) β-hydrogen transfer to hydride with subsequent loss of H2, and (iii) reductive elimination of ethene from chromium(V)cyclopropane.

Process efficiency: The high activation energy of the oxidative addition mechanism suggests that it may not be the most efficient route for catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane on Cr(III)silica catalysts. Other mechanisms, such as σ-bond metathesis on a hydridochromium(III) species, appear to have lower activation energies and may be more efficient.

Role of site isolation: The study demonstrates that the number of oxygen bridges connecting chromium to the silica surface plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. Two-bridge sites support the oxidative addition mechanism, while three-bridge sites do not. This suggests that site isolation and the specific structure of the chromium species on the support significantly influence the reaction pathway and efficiency.

In conclusion, while oxidative addition is possible on certain Cr(III)silica sites, the high activation energy and complex reaction pathway make it less favorable compared to other mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of catalyst structure and site isolation in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。本研究主要关注Cr(III)硅催化剂用于乙烷的脱氢。

催化剂：研究主要考察Cr(III)硅催化剂，其中铬(III)被认为是脱氢反应中活性最高的氧化态。研究了块状金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统，特别关注DeRossi型物种，即CrOH通过两个氧桥键合到表面的结构。

实现高选择性和转化率的挑战：主要挑战在于氧化加成机理所需的高活化能。计算得到的活化焓和自由能分别约为220和350 kJ mol^-1，这对于高效催化来说被认为相当高。

提出的反应机理：研究主要关注C-H键活化的氧化加成机理。这种机理涉及铬的形式双氧化，大部分C-H键活化发生在Cr(III)的四重态自旋势能面上，而过渡态和产物则在双重态能量面上。该机理包括几个步骤：(i) 乙烷的氧化加成随后立即进行立体化学重排，(ii) β-氢转移到氢化物配体并随后释放H2，(iii) 从铬(V)环丙烷中还原消除乙烯。

过程效率：氧化加成机理的高活化能表明，它可能不是Cr(III)硅催化剂上乙烷催化脱氢的最有效途径。其他机理，如在氢化铬(III)物种上的σ-键复分解，似乎具有更低的活化能，可能更有效。

位点隔离的作用：研究表明，将铬连接到硅表面的氧桥数量在反应机理中起着关键作用。两桥位点支持氧化加成机理，而三桥位点则不支持。这表明位点隔离和负载体上铬物种的特定结构显著影响反应途径和效率。

总之，虽然氧化加成在某些Cr(III)硅位点上是可能的，但高活化能和复杂的反应途径使其不如其他机理有利。研究强调了催化剂结构和位点隔离在决定ODH过程的效率和选择性方面的重要性。
