[1] "Models of Cr(III)silica were used to study CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from the II state."

[3] "CH activation by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges."

[4] "The bottleneck of CH activation by oxidative addition is therefore better represented by the transition state of the stereochemical rearrangement."

[5] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through three oxygen bridges, we have not been able to optimize any ethylhydridochromium(V) structure and CH activation according to oxidative addition seems to be excluded."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study focuses on Cr(III)silica catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane.

Catalysts: The research primarily examines Cr(III)silica catalysts, with chromium(III) considered the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are investigated, with particular attention to DeRossi-type species where CrOH moieties are bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges.

Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion: The main challenge lies in the high activation energy required for the oxidative addition mechanism. The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation are approximately 220 and 350 kJ mol^-1, respectively, which are considered quite high for efficient catalysis.

Proposed reaction mechanisms: The study focuses on the oxidative addition mechanism for C-H bond activation. This mechanism involves a formal double oxidation of chromium, with most of the C-H bond activation occurring on the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III), while the transition state and product are on the doublet energy surface. The mechanism includes several steps: (i) oxidative addition of ethane followed by immediate stereochemical rearrangement, (ii) β-hydrogen transfer to hydride with subsequent loss of H2, and (iii) reductive elimination of ethene from chromium(V)cyclopropane.

Process efficiency: The high activation energy of the oxidative addition mechanism suggests that it may not be the most efficient route for catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane on Cr(III)silica catalysts. Other mechanisms, such as σ-bond metathesis on a hydridochromium(III) species, appear to have lower activation energies and may be more efficient.

Role of site isolation: The study demonstrates that the number of oxygen bridges connecting chromium to the silica surface plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. Two-bridge sites support the oxidative addition mechanism, while three-bridge sites do not. This suggests that site isolation and the specific structure of the chromium species on the support significantly influence the reaction pathway and efficiency.

In conclusion, while oxidative addition is possible on certain Cr(III)silica sites, the high activation energy and complex reaction pathway make it less favorable compared to other mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of catalyst structure and site isolation in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。本研究主要关注Cr(III)硅催化剂用于乙烷的脱氢。

催化剂：研究主要考察Cr(III)硅催化剂，其中铬(III)被认为是脱氢反应中活性最高的氧化态。研究了块状金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统，特别关注DeRossi型物种，即CrOH通过两个氧桥键合到表面的结构。

实现高选择性和转化率的挑战：主要挑战在于氧化加成机理所需的高活化能。计算得到的活化焓和自由能分别约为220和350 kJ mol^-1，这对于高效催化来说被认为相当高。

提出的反应机理：研究主要关注C-H键活化的氧化加成机理。这种机理涉及铬的形式双氧化，大部分C-H键活化发生在Cr(III)的四重态自旋势能面上，而过渡态和产物则在双重态能量面上。该机理包括几个步骤：(i) 乙烷的氧化加成随后立即进行立体化学重排，(ii) β-氢转移到氢化物配体并随后释放H2，(iii) 从铬(V)环丙烷中还原消除乙烯。

过程效率：氧化加成机理的高活化能表明，它可能不是Cr(III)硅催化剂上乙烷催化脱氢的最有效途径。其他机理，如在氢化铬(III)物种上的σ-键复分解，似乎具有更低的活化能，可能更有效。

位点隔离的作用：研究表明，将铬连接到硅表面的氧桥数量在反应机理中起着关键作用。两桥位点支持氧化加成机理，而三桥位点则不支持。这表明位点隔离和负载体上铬物种的特定结构显著影响反应途径和效率。

总之，虽然氧化加成在某些Cr(III)硅位点上是可能的，但高活化能和复杂的反应途径使其不如其他机理有利。研究强调了催化剂结构和位点隔离在决定ODH过程的效率和选择性方面的重要性。
