[1] "Croxide systems have been a topic of research since 1933. This effort has provided significant insight through a variety of experimental designs."

[2] "The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from the II state."

[3] "Owing to the complexity of the catalyst surface, much about the active site and the reaction mechanism is still unknown. One crucial question concerns the mechanism of CH activation, for which the focus has been on activation through direct interaction with chromium."

[4] "The two most relevant ones are oxidative and electrophilic addition. Electrophilic addition is also known as -bond metathesis, since metalligand and CH bonds are replaced by metal carbon and ligandhydrogen bonds. Conversely, in oxidative addition of ethane, carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the CH bond is broken."

[5] "Here, we investigated whether CH activation by oxidative addition may represent a viable route to alkane dehydrogenation."

[6] "The surface models used in the current study are detailed in Ref. 23. Cluster models were constructed either in an ad hoc manner, drawing on chemical intuition and experimental facts or systematically, starting from low-index surfaces of silica crystals."

[7] "Based on the present computations, CH activation by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges. The activation energy computed for this initial step is 160 kJ mol1."

[8] "The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species."

[9] "CH activation by oxidative addition thus seems to be an unlikely route to catalytic dehydrogenation for Cr(III)silica catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst types, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. Based on the provided literature:

1. Catalysts: The study focuses on Cr-oxide systems, particularly Cr(III)-silica catalysts. These supported systems have been researched since 1933, with Cr(III) considered the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The paper investigates CH activation through oxidative addition as a potential route for alkane dehydrogenation. This mechanism involves direct binding of carbon and hydrogen to the metal as the CH bond breaks. Other mechanisms mentioned include electrophilic addition (σ-bond metathesis) and β-hydrogen transfer.

3. Challenges in selectivity and conversion: The complexity of the catalyst surface makes it difficult to fully understand the active site and reaction mechanism. This uncertainty poses challenges for achieving high selectivity and conversion.

4. Site isolation: The study uses various surface models, including cluster models constructed both ad hoc and systematically from silica crystal surfaces. This approach helps in understanding the role of site isolation in the reaction process.

5. Process efficiency: The research shows that CH activation by oxidative addition on Cr(III)-silica catalysts has a high activation energy (160 kJ/mol for the initial step), making it an unlikely route for efficient catalytic dehydrogenation. The overall activation energy for this mechanism is comparable to that of σ-bond metathesis on three-bridge species.

In conclusion, while oxidative addition was investigated as a potential mechanism for ODH, the high activation energy and complexity of the process suggest that it may not be the most efficient route for Cr(III)-silica catalysts. The study highlights the importance of understanding different reaction mechanisms and catalyst structures to improve the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂类型、反应机理和位点隔离。根据提供的文献：

1. 催化剂：该研究主要关注Cr-氧化物系统，特别是Cr(III)-硅催化剂。这些负载型系统自1933年以来一直是研究对象，其中Cr(III)被认为是脱氢反应中最活跃的氧化态。

2. 反应机理：该论文研究了通过氧化加成进行CH活化作为烷烃脱氢的潜在途径。这种机制涉及碳和氢直接与金属结合，同时CH键断裂。其他提到的机制包括亲电加成（σ-键复分解）和β-氢转移。

3. 选择性和转化率的挑战：催化剂表面的复杂性使得完全理解活性位点和反应机理变得困难。这种不确定性给实现高选择性和转化率带来了挑战。

4. 位点隔离：该研究使用了各种表面模型，包括通过特殊方法和系统地从二氧化硅晶体表面构建的簇模型。这种方法有助于理解位点隔离在反应过程中的作用。

5. 过程效率：研究表明，在Cr(III)-硅催化剂上通过氧化加成进行CH活化的活化能较高（初始步骤为160 kJ/mol），这使得它不太可能成为高效催化脱氢的途径。这种机制的总活化能与三桥物种上的σ-键复分解相当。

总之，虽然氧化加成被研究作为ODH的潜在机制，但高活化能和过程的复杂性表明它可能不是Cr(III)-硅催化剂最有效的途径。该研究强调了理解不同反应机理和催化剂结构对提高ODH过程整体效率的重要性。
