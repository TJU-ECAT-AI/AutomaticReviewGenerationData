[1] "Models of Cr(III)silica were used to study CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from the II state."

[3] "The reaction involves a formal double oxidation of chromium and whereas most of the actual activation of the CH bond takes place on the quartet spin potential energy surface of Cr(III), the transition state and the ethylhydridochromium(V) product are located on the doublet energy surface."

[4] "The product is unstable with respect to the back-reaction and completion of a dehydrogenation cycle requires that -hydrogen transfer must take place in the extension of the CH activation step."

[5] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges, the preferred mode of -hydrogen transfer is via a stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand with release of H2."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. This study focuses on Cr(III)silica catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation.

Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are evident from the instability of intermediates. The ethylhydridochromium(V) product formed after CH activation is unstable and prone to back-reaction, necessitating immediate -hydrogen transfer to complete the dehydrogenation cycle.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves several steps:
1. CH activation by oxidative addition
2. Stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex
3. -hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand, releasing H2
4. Desorption of ethene, regenerating the catalyst

The process efficiency is influenced by the activation energies of these steps and the stability of intermediates. The computed enthalpy and free energy of activation for the rate-determining step (stereochemical rearrangement) are high (220 and 350 kJ/mol, respectively), suggesting this mechanism may not be favorable for catalytic dehydrogenation.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The study shows that Cr(III) sites linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges (DeRossi-type sites) support the proposed mechanism, while sites with three oxygen bridges do not form stable ethylhydridochromium(V) intermediates, excluding CH activation by oxidative addition.

Overall, this research suggests that while oxidative addition is possible on certain Cr(III)silica sites, it may not be the most efficient route for catalytic dehydrogenation due to high activation energies and unstable intermediates. Alternative mechanisms, such as CH activation by -bond metathesis on hydridochromium(III) species, appear more promising for achieving higher process efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机制之间的复杂相互作用。本研究重点关注Cr(III)硅胶催化剂对乙烷脱氢的作用。

在实现高选择性和高转化率方面的挑战从中间体的不稳定性可见一斑。CH活化后形成的乙基氢化铬(V)产物不稳定且容易发生逆反应，需要立即进行β-氢转移以完成脱氢循环。

提出的反应机制包括几个步骤：
1. 通过氧化加成进行CH活化
2. 乙基氢化铬(V)络合物的立体化学重排
3. β-氢转移到氢化物配体，释放H2
4. 乙烯脱附，再生催化剂

过程效率受这些步骤的活化能和中间体稳定性的影响。计算得出的速率决定步骤（立体化学重排）的活化焓和自由能很高（分别为220和350 kJ/mol），表明这种机制可能不利于催化脱氢。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。研究表明，通过两个氧桥连接到硅胶表面的Cr(III)位点（DeRossi型位点）支持所提出的机制，而具有三个氧桥的位点不形成稳定的乙基氢化铬(V)中间体，排除了通过氧化加成进行CH活化的可能性。

总的来说，这项研究表明，虽然氧化加成在某些Cr(III)硅胶位点上是可能的，但由于高活化能和不稳定的中间体，它可能不是催化脱氢的最有效途径。其他机制，如在氢化铬(III)物种上通过σ-键复分解进行CH活化，似乎更有希望实现更高的过程效率。
