[1] "Models of Cr(III)silica were used to study CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from the II state."

[3] "One crucial question concerns the mechanism of CH activation, for which the focus has been on activation through direct interaction with chromium."

[4] "Based on the present computations, CH activation by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges."

[5] "The computed activation energy for this initial step is 160 kJ mol1. However, since the ethylhydridochromium complex is unstable with respect to reductive elimination, the subsequent step towards dehydrogenation must proceed immediately."

[6] "The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species."

[7] "CH activation by oxidative addition thus seems to be an unlikely route to catalytic dehydrogenation for Cr(III)silica catalysts."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study focuses on Cr(III)silica catalysts, which are believed to be the most active for dehydrogenation.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The research explores CH activation by oxidative addition as a potential route to catalytic dehydrogenation. This mechanism is possible on DeRossi-type species, where CrOH moieties are bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges.

However, the process faces several challenges:

1. High activation energy: The initial CH activation step has a computed activation energy of 160 kJ/mol.

2. Instability of intermediates: The ethylhydridochromium complex formed is unstable and prone to reductive elimination, necessitating an immediate subsequent step.

3. Overall high activation energy: The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is comparable to that of -bond metathesis on unstrained three-bridge species, which is considered high.

4. Competing mechanisms: Other mechanisms, such as CH activation by -bond metathesis on a hydridochromium(III) species, show lower activation energies (<100 kJ/mol) and may be more favorable.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The study compares different models (two-bridge and three-bridge) of chromium sites on the silica surface. The results suggest that the structure and binding of the chromium species to the surface significantly influence the reaction mechanism and energy barriers.

In conclusion, while CH activation by oxidative addition is possible on certain Cr(III)silica catalysts, it appears to be an unlikely route for efficient catalytic dehydrogenation due to high energy barriers and competing, more favorable mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms, and energy barriers in designing effective ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。这项研究主要关注Cr(III)硅胶催化剂，被认为是脱氢反应中活性最高的催化剂。

ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。研究探索了通过氧化加成进行CH活化作为催化脱氢的潜在途径。这种机理在DeRossi型物种上是可能的，其中CrOH部分通过两个氧桥与表面结合。

然而，该过程面临几个挑战：

1. 高活化能：初始CH活化步骤的计算活化能为160 kJ/mol。

2. 中间体不稳定：形成的乙基氢化铬复合物不稳定，容易发生还原消除，需要立即进行后续步骤。

3. 总体高活化能：基于氧化加成的脱氢总体活化能与非应变三桥物种上的-键复分解相当，被认为是较高的。

4. 竞争机理：其他机理，如在氢化铬(III)物种上通过-键复分解进行CH活化，显示出较低的活化能（<100 kJ/mol），可能更有利。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。研究比较了硅胶表面上铬位点的不同模型（双桥和三桥）。结果表明，铬物种与表面的结构和结合方式显著影响反应机理和能量障碍。

总之，虽然在某些Cr(III)硅胶催化剂上通过氧化加成进行CH活化是可能的，但由于高能量障碍和存在更有利的竞争机理，它似乎不太可能成为有效的催化脱氢途径。这项研究强调了在设计有效的ODH过程中，理解催化剂结构、反应机理和能量障碍之间相互作用的重要性。
