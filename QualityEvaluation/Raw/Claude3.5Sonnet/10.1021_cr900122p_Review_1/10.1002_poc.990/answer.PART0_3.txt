The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature primarily focuses on Cr-oxide systems as catalysts for short alkane dehydrogenation, with chromium(III) considered the most active oxidation state.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are related to the complexity of the catalyst surface and the uncertainty surrounding the active site and reaction mechanism. The main focus has been on CH activation through direct interaction with chromium.

Two primary reaction mechanisms are discussed: oxidative addition and electrophilic addition (also known as σ-bond metathesis). The study investigates whether CH activation by oxidative addition is a viable route for alkane dehydrogenation.

The research shows that CH activation by oxidative addition is possible on DeRossi-type species (CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges), with an activation energy of 160 kJ/mol for the initial step. However, the overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is relatively high, comparable to the σ-bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species.

Site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues, as evidenced by the discussion of different chromium sites (two-bridge vs. three-bridge models) and their impact on the reaction mechanism.

The study concludes that CH activation by oxidative addition is unlikely to be an efficient route for catalytic dehydrogenation of Cr(III)-silica catalysts. This suggests that other mechanisms, such as σ-bond metathesis or alternative catalyst systems, may be more promising for improving process efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献主要关注Cr-氧化物系统作为短链烷烃脱氢的催化剂，其中三价铬被认为是最活跃的氧化态。

在实现高选择性和高转化率方面的挑战与催化剂表面的复杂性以及活性位点和反应机理的不确定性有关。主要焦点一直是通过与铬的直接相互作用来活化CH键。

文中讨论了两种主要的反应机理：氧化加成和亲电加成（也称为σ-键复分解）。该研究探讨了通过氧化加成活化CH键是否是烷烃脱氢的可行途径。

研究表明，在DeRossi类型的物种（通过两个氧桥键合到表面的CrOH部分）上，通过氧化加成进行CH活化是可能的，初始步骤的活化能为160 kJ/mol。然而，基于氧化加成的脱氢总活化能相对较高，与无应变三桥物种上的σ-键复分解反应相当。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用，这从不同铬位点（双桥模型vs三桥模型）及其对反应机理的影响的讨论中可以看出。

研究得出结论，通过氧化加成进行CH活化不太可能成为Cr(III)-硅胶催化剂催化脱氢的有效途径。这表明，其他机制（如σ-键复分解）或替代催化剂系统可能更有希望提高烷烃氧化脱氢过程的效率。
