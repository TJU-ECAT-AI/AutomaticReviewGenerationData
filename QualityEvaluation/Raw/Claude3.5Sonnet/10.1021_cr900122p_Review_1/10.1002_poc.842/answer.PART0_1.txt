[1] "Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed, and some 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins are anually produced this way."

[2] "Finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium2,3 appear as the most interesting catalysts from an industrial point of view."

[3] "On this basis, DeRossi and co-workers13,26,27 concluded that the reaction requires only mononuclear chromium species."

[4] "A recurrent idea is that CH activation could involve a CrO pair."

[5] "During oxidative addition, both carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the CH bond is broken. Electrophilic addition can also be described as a -bond metathesis reaction,39 as a metalligand bond and a CH bond are replaced by a metalC bond and a ligandH bond."

[6] "Our calculations show that the coordination energy of ethane to chromium is negligible, and that the same applies to H2. Even at the more polar alumina surface, taking into account the elevated temperatures at which the reaction takes place, it appears that adsorption would require a reactive collision of ethane on the chromium site, making the CH activation step follow Eley Rideal kinetics."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed for this process, with finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium being the most industrially relevant catalysts.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is partly addressed by using site-isolated catalysts, as research has shown that mononuclear chromium species are sufficient for the reaction. Site isolation helps prevent unwanted side reactions and improves selectivity.

Several reaction mechanisms have been proposed for ODH. One common idea is that C-H bond activation involves a Cr-O pair. The process can occur through either oxidative addition or electrophilic addition (σ-bond metathesis). In oxidative addition, both carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the C-H bond breaks. In σ-bond metathesis, a metal-ligand bond and a C-H bond are replaced by a metal-C bond and a ligand-H bond.

Contrary to some earlier proposals, calculations suggest that the initial step does not involve molecular adsorption of the alkane on the catalyst surface. Instead, the C-H activation likely occurs through a reactive collision following Eley-Rideal kinetics, especially at elevated temperatures.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by factors such as the nature of the catalyst (bulk metal oxides vs. supported systems), the reaction temperature, and the specific mechanism of C-H activation. The formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent β-H abstraction are key steps in many proposed mechanisms.

Overall, achieving high efficiency in ODH requires careful catalyst design to balance activity and selectivity, often through site isolation, and a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms to optimize process conditions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。该过程已开发出同相和多相催化系统，其中细分散的铂和氧化物负载的铬是工业上最相关的催化剂。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。这部分通过使用位点隔离的催化剂来解决，因为研究表明单核铬物种足以进行反应。位点隔离有助于防止不需要的副反应并提高选择性。

ODH已提出了几种反应机理。一个常见的想法是C-H键活化涉及Cr-O对。该过程可以通过氧化加成或亲电加成（σ键复分解）发生。在氧化加成中，当C-H键断裂时，碳和氢都直接与金属结合。在σ键复分解中，金属-配体键和C-H键被金属-C键和配体-H键取代。

与一些早期的提议相反，计算表明初始步骤不涉及烷烃在催化剂表面的分子吸附。相反，C-H活化可能是通过遵循Eley-Rideal动力学的反应性碰撞发生的，特别是在高温下。

ODH过程的效率受到诸如催化剂性质（块状金属氧化物vs.负载系统）、反应温度和C-H活化的具体机理等因素的影响。M-烷基中间体的形成和随后的β-H消除是许多提议机理中的关键步骤。

总的来说，实现ODH的高效率需要仔细的催化剂设计以平衡活性和选择性，通常通过位点隔离实现，并深入了解反应机理以优化工艺条件。
