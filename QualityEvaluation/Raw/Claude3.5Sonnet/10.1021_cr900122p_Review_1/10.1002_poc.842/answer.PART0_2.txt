[1] "There is some controversy concerning the oxidation state of chromium active for dehydrogenation of alkanes. Both Cr(II) and Cr(III) were proposed as the active state quite early on. The dominating view in the modern literature is that III is the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from II."

[2] "On this basis, DeRossi and co-workers concluded that the reaction requires only mononuclear chromium species."

[3] "A recurrent idea is that CH activation could involve a CrO pair."

[4] "According to this mechanism, the alkene is formed as a result of hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to chromium, whereas regeneration of the catalytic site and formation of H2 concludes the catalytic cycle"

[5] "For chromium, -bond metathesis would be expected and is explored in this work."

[6] "A mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis, accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."

[7] "Based on the computed energies, an alternative mechanism is formulated in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in reaction (2) (above), rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands."

[8] "The importance of this alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain a reactive hydridochromium site, i.e. to prevent formation of more stable species in which chromium is covalently bonded to three oxygen ligands. This ability is a sensitive function of the local structure about chromium."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature primarily focuses on chromium-based catalysts, particularly supported on silica.

For catalysts, the active species is believed to be mononuclear chromium, with Cr(III) being the most active oxidation state. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are mentioned, with supported mononuclear chromium species on silica being the focus of the study.

The main challenge in achieving high selectivity and conversion lies in the complexity of the reaction mechanism. Two primary mechanisms are proposed:

1. A three-step mechanism involving CH activation via -bond metathesis, -H transfer to chromium with ethene loss, and regeneration of the chromium site with H2 loss.

2. An alternative mechanism where CH activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by several factors:

1. The oxidation state of chromium, with Cr(III) being most active.
2. The local structure around the chromium site, which affects its reactivity.
3. The ability to maintain reactive hydridochromium sites.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The study emphasizes the importance of mononuclear chromium species, suggesting that isolated sites are key to achieving selective dehydrogenation.

The interplay between these factors collectively influences the process efficiency by determining the dominant reaction pathway and the stability of reactive intermediates. The local structure around chromium, in particular, appears to be a critical factor in determining which mechanism dominates and how efficiently the catalyst performs.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献主要关注铬基催化剂，特别是负载在二氧化硅上的催化剂。

对于催化剂，活性物种被认为是单核铬，其中Cr(III)是最活跃的氧化态。文中提到了块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，但研究重点是负载在二氧化硅上的单核铬物种。

在实现高选择性和转化率方面的主要挑战在于反应机理的复杂性。提出了两种主要机理：

1. 一个三步机理，包括通过σ键复分解的CH活化、铬的β-H转移伴随乙烯损失，以及铬位点的再生伴随H2损失。

2. 一种替代机理，其中CH活化发生在反应性氢化铬络合物上。

过程效率受几个因素影响：

1. 铬的氧化态，其中Cr(III)最活跃。
2. 铬位点周围的局部结构，影响其反应性。
3. 保持反应性氢化铬位点的能力。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。研究强调了单核铬物种的重要性，表明隔离的位点是实现选择性脱氢的关键。

这些因素之间的相互作用通过决定主导反应途径和反应性中间体的稳定性，共同影响过程效率。特别是铬周围的局部结构，似乎是决定哪种机理占主导地位以及催化剂性能如何的关键因素。
