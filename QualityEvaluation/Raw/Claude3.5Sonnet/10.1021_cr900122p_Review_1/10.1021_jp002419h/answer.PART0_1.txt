[1] "Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions."

[2] "Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature."

[3] "The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors. Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides are commonly used catalysts for this reaction. The efficiency of the process is significantly affected by the structure and properties of these catalysts.

For MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts, the ODH rates and selectivity strongly depend on the MoOx surface density. This density can be controlled by adjusting the Mo content and catalyst treatment temperature. As the Mo surface density increases, the structure of the catalyst evolves from isolated MoOx species to two-dimensional oligomers, and eventually to bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures.

The challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated metal oxide species on the support surface are generally more selective for ODH reactions compared to bulk metal oxides or large clusters. This is because isolated sites can limit the extent of secondary reactions that lead to undesired products.

The reaction mechanism for ODH typically involves C-H bond activation as the rate-determining step. This may occur through the formation of M-alkyl intermediates or via a 2H-abstraction mechanism. The specific mechanism depends on the nature of the catalyst and the reaction conditions.

The interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanism, and process conditions collectively determines the efficiency of the ODH process. Optimizing these factors is key to developing more effective catalysts for alkane ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程。负载型钒和钼氧化物是这种反应常用的催化剂。这些催化剂的结构和性质显著影响了过程的效率。

对于MoOx/ZrO2催化剂，ODH反应速率和选择性强烈依赖于MoOx表面密度。这种密度可以通过调整Mo含量和催化剂处理温度来控制。随着Mo表面密度的增加，催化剂的结构从孤立的MoOx物种演变为二维寡聚体，最终形成体相MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2结构。

ODH的挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率。位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。与体相金属氧化物或大型簇相比，支撑表面上孤立的金属氧化物物种通常对ODH反应具有更高的选择性。这是因为孤立的位点可以限制导致不需要产物的二次反应的程度。

ODH的反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化作为决速步骤。这可能通过形成M-烷基中间体或通过2H-抽提机制发生。具体机理取决于催化剂的性质和反应条件。

催化剂结构、反应机理和工艺条件之间的相互作用共同决定了ODH过程的效率。优化这些因素是开发更有效的烷烃ODH反应催化剂的关键。
