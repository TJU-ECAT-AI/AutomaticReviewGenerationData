[1] "Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature."

[2] "For Mo surface densities below the polymolybdate monolayer values (5 Mo/nm2), no crystalline MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 were detected by these methods after thermal treatment at 393973 K."

[3] "The size of these two-dimensional polymolybdate domains increased with increasing Mo surface density; this process led to a shift in the ν(MoO) Raman band, to changes in the near-edge X-ray absorption spectra, and to a decrease in the UVvisible edge energy with increasing surface density."

[4] "Domain growth occurred via oligomerization of isolated tetrahedral MoOx as thermal treatments decreased the ZrO2 surface area available to disperse the MoOx species."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by various factors related to catalyst structure and composition. The literature focuses on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts, showing that propane ODH rates and selectivity depend strongly on the MoOx surface density. This density can be controlled by changing the Mo content and catalyst treatment temperature.

The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role in determining its performance. For Mo surface densities below 5 Mo/nm2 (the polymolybdate monolayer value), no crystalline MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 were detected after thermal treatment. Instead, two-dimensional polymolybdate domains were observed, with their size increasing as Mo surface density increased. This structural evolution led to changes in spectroscopic properties, including shifts in Raman bands and X-ray absorption spectra.

The growth of these domains occurs through oligomerization of isolated tetrahedral MoOx species. This process is facilitated by thermal treatments that decrease the ZrO2 surface area available for MoOx dispersion. The relationship between surface density and domain size suggests that controlling these parameters is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion or proposed reaction mechanisms, the strong dependence of ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx surface density implies that these factors are indeed important. The emphasis on two-dimensional polymolybdate domains and their growth suggests that site isolation may play a role in influencing selectivity, although this is not directly stated.

Overall, the literature indicates that the efficiency of the ODH process is closely tied to the structural characteristics of the catalyst, which can be controlled through composition and treatment conditions. Further research would be needed to directly link these structural features to specific reaction mechanisms and selectivity issues.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)受到与催化剂结构和组成相关的各种因素的影响。文献主要关注MoOx/ZrO2催化剂，表明丙烷ODH的速率和选择性强烈依赖于MoOx的表面密度。这种密度可以通过改变Mo含量和催化剂处理温度来控制。

催化剂的结构在决定其性能方面起着关键作用。对于Mo表面密度低于5 Mo/nm2（多钼酸盐单层值）的情况，在热处理后没有检测到晶态MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2。相反，观察到二维多钼酸盐域，随着Mo表面密度的增加，其尺寸也在增加。这种结构演变导致了光谱性质的变化，包括拉曼带和X射线吸收谱的变化。

这些域的生长是通过孤立的四面体MoOx物种的寡聚化实现的。这个过程是由降低ZrO2表面积的热处理促进的，而ZrO2表面积用于MoOx的分散。表面密度和域大小之间的关系表明，控制这些参数对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

虽然文献没有明确讨论在实现高选择性和转化率方面的挑战或提出的反应机制，但ODH速率和选择性对MoOx表面密度的强烈依赖性表明这些因素确实很重要。对二维多钼酸盐域及其生长的强调表明，位点隔离可能在影响选择性方面发挥作用，尽管这并未直接说明。

总的来说，文献表明ODH过程的效率与催化剂的结构特征密切相关，这些特征可以通过组成和处理条件来控制。需要进一步的研究来直接将这些结构特征与特定的反应机制和选择性问题联系起来。
