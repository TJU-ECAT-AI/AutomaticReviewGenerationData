[1] "Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions."

[2] "Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature."

[3] "The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). However, based on the available information:

Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides are commonly used catalysts for selective oxidation reactions, including ODH. The performance of these catalysts, specifically MoOx/ZrO2, depends strongly on the surface density of the active metal oxide. This surface density can be controlled by adjusting the metal content and the catalyst treatment temperature.

The structure of supported molybdenum oxide evolves from isolated MoOx species to two-dimensional oligomers, and eventually to bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures. This structural evolution is influenced by factors such as Mo surface density, treatment temperature, and support reactivity.

While the document does not directly address reaction mechanisms, selectivity challenges, or the role of site isolation, it suggests that the catalyst structure and composition play a crucial role in determining its performance for ODH reactions. The ability to control the catalyst structure through preparation methods may be key to addressing selectivity and efficiency issues in ODH processes.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的问题。但是，根据可用信息：

负载型钒和钼氧化物是常用于选择性氧化反应(包括ODH)的催化剂。这些催化剂的性能，特别是MoOx/ZrO2，强烈依赖于活性金属氧化物的表面密度。这种表面密度可以通过调整金属含量和催化剂处理温度来控制。

负载型钼氧化物的结构从孤立的MoOx物种演变为二维寡聚体，最终形成块状MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2结构。这种结构演变受到诸如Mo表面密度、处理温度和载体反应性等因素的影响。

虽然文档没有直接涉及反应机理、选择性挑战或位点隔离的作用，但它表明催化剂结构和组成在决定其ODH反应性能方面起着关键作用。通过制备方法控制催化剂结构的能力可能是解决ODH过程中选择性和效率问题的关键。
