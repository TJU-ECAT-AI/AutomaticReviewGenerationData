[1] "The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is removal of hydrogen and suppression of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, the pathway of hydrogen removal is still not clear."

[2] "It is proposed that carbon dioxide can react directly with hydrogen to make the water gas (CO + H2O) or can act as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation. It is difficult to determine which of the pathways predominates."

[3] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[4] "The results suggest that the promoting effect of CO2 on the propane conversion and the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is caused by synergistic effect between the RWGS and the dehydrogenation reactions."

[5] "However, the behavior of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst in the case of the RWGS reaction coupled with dehydrogenation reaction can be different than in the case of single RWGS reaction. Therefore on the basis of the presented results we cannot exclude the other explanation where CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative pathway (3, 4)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses the use of both bulk metal oxides and supported systems, particularly focusing on chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2).

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The process efficiency is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst choice: Different metal oxides (V, Cr, Ce, Fe, Ga) show varying behaviors in the dehydrogenation process.

2. Reaction mechanisms: Two main pathways are proposed - direct hydrogen removal by CO2 to form water gas, and CO2 acting as a mild oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation. The predominant pathway depends on the catalyst used.

3. Synergistic effects: The interaction between reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction and dehydrogenation reaction can enhance propane conversion and propene yield.

4. Oxidative pathway: For some catalysts, CO2 may act as an oxidant, leading to a different reaction mechanism.

The role of site isolation is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, it can be inferred that the choice of support (e.g., silica) and the preparation method (equilibrium adsorption) may contribute to the dispersion of active sites, potentially affecting selectivity.

The process efficiency is ultimately determined by the balance between these factors. The choice of catalyst and reaction conditions can shift the balance towards either the redox or non-redox pathway, affecting the overall performance of the ODH process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了使用体相金属氧化物和负载型催化剂系统，特别关注了负载在二氧化硅上的铬氧化物催化剂（CrOx/SiO2）。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。过程效率受以下几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂选择：不同的金属氧化物（V、Cr、Ce、Fe、Ga）在脱氢过程中表现出不同的行为。

2. 反应机理：提出了两种主要途径 - CO2直接除氢形成水煤气，以及CO2作为温和氧化剂进行氧化脱氢。主导途径取决于所使用的催化剂。

3. 协同效应：逆水煤气反应（RWGS）与脱氢反应之间的相互作用可以提高丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

4. 氧化途径：对于某些催化剂，CO2可能作为氧化剂，导致不同的反应机理。

给定的文献中没有明确讨论位点隔离的作用。然而，可以推断，载体的选择（如二氧化硅）和制备方法（平衡吸附）可能有助于活性位点的分散，潜在地影响选择性。

过程效率最终由这些因素之间的平衡决定。催化剂的选择和反应条件可以将平衡转向氧化还原或非氧化还原途径，从而影响ODH过程的整体性能。
