[1] "The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is removal of hydrogen and suppression of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, the pathway of hydrogen removal is still not clear."

[2] "It is proposed that carbon dioxide can react directly with hydrogen to make the water gas (CO + H2O) or can act as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation. It is difficult to determine which of the pathways predominates."

[3] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."

[4] "The results suggest that the promoting effect of CO2 on the propane conversion and the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is caused by synergistic effect between the RWGS and the dehydrogenation reactions."

[5] "Therefore on the basis of the presented results we cannot exclude the other explanation where CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative pathway (3, 4)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses the use of bulk metal oxides and supported systems, such as chromium oxide supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2), as catalysts for this process.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The process efficiency is influenced by several factors, including the choice of catalyst, reaction conditions, and the role of carbon dioxide as a reactant.

Two main reaction mechanisms are proposed:

1. A two-step pathway involving dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.
2. An oxidative pathway where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant.

The exact mechanism is still unclear and may vary depending on the catalyst used. For instance, vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts are thought to follow the oxidative pathway, while gallium oxide likely follows a non-redox pathway.

The role of site isolation is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, it can be inferred that the support material (e.g., silica) may play a role in isolating active sites, which could potentially address selectivity issues by preventing unwanted side reactions.

The promoting effect of CO2 on propane conversion and propene yield is attributed to a synergistic effect between the RWGS and dehydrogenation reactions. This synergy helps overcome thermodynamic limitations and improves overall process efficiency.

In conclusion, the ODH process efficiency is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including catalyst choice, reaction mechanisms, and the role of CO2. Further research is needed to fully understand and optimize these factors for improved selectivity and conversion in industrial applications.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了使用块状金属氧化物和负载系统（如负载在二氧化硅上的铬氧化物CrOx/SiO2）作为这一过程的催化剂。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。过程效率受多个因素影响，包括催化剂的选择、反应条件以及二氧化碳作为反应物的作用。

提出了两种主要的反应机理：

1. 涉及脱氢反应后接逆水气变换（RWGS）反应的两步机理。
2. 二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂的氧化机理。

确切的机理仍不清楚，可能因所用催化剂而异。例如，钒、铬、铈和铁氧化物催化剂被认为遵循氧化机理，而氧化镓可能遵循非氧化还原机理。

给定的文献中没有明确讨论位点隔离的作用。然而，可以推断载体材料（如二氧化硅）可能在隔离活性位点方面发挥作用，这可能通过防止不需要的副反应来解决选择性问题。

二氧化碳对丙烷转化率和丙烯收率的促进作用归因于RWGS反应和脱氢反应之间的协同效应。这种协同作用有助于克服热力学限制，提高整体过程效率。

总之，ODH过程效率受到多种因素的复杂相互作用影响，包括催化剂选择、反应机理和二氧化碳的作用。需要进一步研究以充分理解和优化这些因素，以改善工业应用中的选择性和转化率。
