[1] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain signicant yields of alkenes"

[2] "Because all equivalent CH bonds in an alkane molecule have an equal chance of reacting, a dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather unselective."

[3] "Furthermore, the required high temperatures favor thermal cracking reactions to lighter alkanes and coke. As a consequence, suitable catalysts not only have to possess good activity and selectivity, but also must suppress thermal cracking reactions."

[4] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[5] "De Rossi et al. [44,45] have found even higher dehydrogenation activities for Cr/ZrO2 catalysts."

The literature provided does not directly discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). Instead, it focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over supported chromium oxide catalysts. However, some of the principles and challenges mentioned are relevant to ODH as well.

The document highlights that alkane dehydrogenation is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures to achieve significant alkene yields. This creates challenges for selectivity, as all C-H bonds have an equal chance of reacting, making the process inherently unselective. Additionally, high temperatures promote unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking and coking.

To address these challenges, suitable catalysts must possess both good activity and selectivity while suppressing cracking reactions. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, are widely used commercially due to their superior properties. Some studies have found even higher activities for Cr/ZrO2 catalysts.

While the document does not discuss ODH specifically, many of these same challenges apply - namely achieving high selectivity and conversion while minimizing side reactions. The role of catalyst choice and support material is crucial in both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide information on reaction mechanisms, M-alkyl intermediates, or site isolation for ODH. To fully address the question, additional information on ODH catalysts, mechanisms, and strategies for improving selectivity would be needed.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)。相反，它主要关注在负载型氧化铬催化剂上进行的非氧化烷烃脱氢。然而，其中提到的一些原理和挑战也与ODH相关。

文献指出，烷烃脱氢是吸热反应，需要高温和低压才能获得显著的烯烃产率。这给选择性带来了挑战，因为所有C-H键都有同等的反应机会，使得该过程本质上是非选择性的。此外，高温会促进不需要的副反应，如热裂解和结焦。

为了应对这些挑战，合适的催化剂必须具备良好的活性和选择性，同时抑制裂解反应。由于其优越的性能，负载型氧化铬催化剂，尤其是Cr2O3/Al2O3，在商业上被广泛使用。一些研究发现Cr/ZrO2催化剂甚至具有更高的活性。

尽管文献没有特别讨论ODH，但许多相同的挑战也适用于ODH - 即在最大程度地减少副反应的同时实现高选择性和高转化率。在氧化和非氧化脱氢过程中，催化剂的选择和载体材料的作用都至关重要。

文献没有提供有关ODH反应机理、金属-烷基中间体或位点隔离的信息。要全面回答这个问题，还需要额外的关于ODH催化剂、机理和提高选择性策略的信息。
