[1] "Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates was often carried out over supported transition metal oxides. Among various catalysts employed, V2O5 [1012] and MoO3 [1,1315] were considered to be the most active and selective catalysts, while recent studies showed that Fe [1618] and W [19,20] oxides are also of great promise."

[2] "However, a high temperature is generally required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature, the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into unwanted carbon oxides. Therefore, in spite of great effort, the single-pass yield of oxygenates is still quite low, usually less than 4%, far from fulfilling the industrial requirement [7]."

[3] "We concentrated on the activation of CH bonds by terminal oxygens [ O] and bridge oxygens [O]. We considered eight possible mechanisms."

[4] "H abstraction is a 1e process (Fig. 4), which involves radical formation with the metal center being reduced formally by one unit."

[5] "Among the eight pathways considered here, the most favorable pathway is anti-H abstraction (T6) by terminal oxygen with the exception of W3O9, where (2 + 2) (T1) appears to be the best pathway."

[6] "A fairly good compliance between H abstraction mechanism and experimental evidences supports that H abstraction is the working mechanism for the activation of alkanes on most high valence transition metal oxides."

[7] "We also infer that the interplay between the MO bond polarity and the M O p bond strength may counterbalance the reactivity and the selectivity, hence V and Mo oxides are the most active and selective catalysts experimentally observed [1,1015]."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors:

Catalysts: Supported transition metal oxides are commonly used, with V2O5 and MoO3 being the most active and selective. Fe and W oxides have also shown promise. The choice of catalyst significantly impacts the efficiency of the process.

Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult. High temperatures required for methane activation lead to over-oxidation of desired products to carbon oxides. As a result, single-pass yields of oxygenates are typically below 4%, which is insufficient for industrial applications.

Reaction mechanisms: Multiple pathways for C-H bond activation were considered, including (2+2) additions, two-electron oxidation processes, and H abstraction. The study found that H abstraction by terminal oxygen is generally the most favorable pathway, except for tungsten oxide where (2+2) addition is preferred. This H abstraction mechanism involves radical formation and one-electron reduction of the metal center.

Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the interplay between catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways. The balance between MO bond polarity and M-O π bond strength affects both reactivity and selectivity, explaining why V and Mo oxides are experimentally observed to be the most active and selective catalysts.

Site isolation: While not explicitly discussed in the given text, site isolation typically plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by preventing over-oxidation of products. This concept is often applied in the design of supported catalysts to improve selectivity in ODH reactions.

In conclusion, the ODH process efficiency is a result of the complex interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and operating conditions. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing more efficient catalytic systems that can achieve both high selectivity and conversion.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

催化剂：常用的是负载型过渡金属氧化物，其中V2O5和MoO3被认为是最活跃和选择性最好的。Fe和W氧化物也显示出潜力。催化剂的选择对过程效率有显著影响。

挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率是困难的。甲烷活化所需的高温会导致所需产物过度氧化为碳氧化物。因此，含氧化合物的单程产率通常低于4%，不足以满足工业应用需求。

反应机理：研究考虑了多种C-H键活化途径，包括(2+2)加成、双电子氧化过程和氢抽提。研究发现，除了钨氧化物外，端基氧的氢抽提通常是最有利的途径，而钨氧化物则倾向于(2+2)加成。这种氢抽提机理涉及自由基形成和金属中心的单电子还原。

过程效率：效率受催化剂性质、反应条件和机理途径相互作用的影响。M-O键极性和M-O π键强度之间的平衡影响了反应活性和选择性，这解释了为什么V和Mo氧化物在实验中被观察到是最活跃和选择性最好的催化剂。

位点隔离：虽然在给定文本中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离通常在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用，防止产物过度氧化。这个概念常应用于负载型催化剂的设计，以提高ODH反应的选择性。

总之，ODH过程效率是催化剂性质、反应机理和操作条件复杂相互作用的结果。理解这些因素对于开发能同时实现高选择性和高转化率的更高效催化系统至关重要。
