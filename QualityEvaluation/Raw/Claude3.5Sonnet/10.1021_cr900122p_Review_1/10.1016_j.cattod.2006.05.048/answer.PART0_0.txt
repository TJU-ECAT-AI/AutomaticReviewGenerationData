[1] "Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates was often carried out over supported transition metal oxides. Among various catalysts employed, V2O5 [1012] and MoO3 [1,1315] were considered to be the most active and selective catalysts, while recent studies showed that Fe [1618] and W [19,20] oxides are also of great promise."

[2] "However, a high temperature is generally required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature, the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into unwanted carbon oxides. Therefore, in spite of great effort, the single-pass yield of oxygenates is still quite low, usually less than 4%, far from fulfilling the industrial requirement [7]."

[3] "We concentrated on the activation of CH bonds by terminal oxygens [ O] and bridge oxygens [O]. We considered eight possible mechanisms."

[4] "Among the eight pathways considered here, the most favorable pathway is anti-H abstraction (T6) by terminal oxygen with the exception of W3O9, where (2 + 2) (T1) appears to be the best pathway."

[5] "We infer that the interplay between the MO bond polarity and the M O p bond strength may counterbalance the reactivity and the selectivity, hence V and Mo oxides are the most active and selective catalysts experimentally observed [1,1015]."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion. The literature discusses several key aspects:

Catalysts: Supported transition metal oxides, particularly V2O5 and MoO3, are considered the most active and selective catalysts for methane oxidation. Fe and W oxides have also shown promise in recent studies. The choice of catalyst significantly influences the process efficiency.

Challenges: A major challenge in ODH is the requirement for high temperatures to activate methane. At these temperatures, desired oxygenates quickly oxidize into unwanted carbon oxides. This results in low single-pass yields, typically less than 4%, which is insufficient for industrial applications.

Reaction mechanisms: The study examined eight possible mechanisms for C-H bond activation, focusing on terminal and bridge oxygens. The most favorable pathway for most catalysts was found to be anti-H abstraction by terminal oxygen, except for tungsten oxide where a (2+2) addition mechanism was preferred.

Selectivity and conversion: The interplay between M-O bond polarity and M-O π bond strength is crucial in balancing reactivity and selectivity. This balance explains why vanadium and molybdenum oxides are experimentally observed to be the most active and selective catalysts.

Site isolation: While not explicitly discussed in the given literature, site isolation is an important concept in addressing selectivity issues. It involves isolating active sites to prevent over-oxidation of products, which could potentially improve the yield of desired oxygenates.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the choice of catalyst, the dominant reaction mechanism, and the ability to balance reactivity with selectivity. Overcoming the challenge of low yields at high temperatures remains a key focus for improving the industrial viability of this process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂、反应机理以及在实现高选择性和转化率方面的挑战之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了几个关键方面：

催化剂：负载型过渡金属氧化物，特别是V2O5和MoO3，被认为是甲烷氧化最活跃和最选择性的催化剂。近期研究表明Fe和W氧化物也很有前景。催化剂的选择显著影响过程效率。

挑战：ODH的一个主要挑战是需要高温来活化甲烷。在这些温度下，所需的含氧化合物会迅速氧化成不需要的碳氧化物。这导致单程收率低，通常不到4%，不足以满足工业应用需求。

反应机理：研究考察了C-H键活化的八种可能机理，重点关注端氧和桥氧。研究发现，对于大多数催化剂，最有利的途径是通过端氧进行反-H抽取，除了钨氧化物，其中(2+2)加成机理更为优先。

选择性和转化率：M-O键极性和M-O π键强度之间的相互作用在平衡反应性和选择性方面至关重要。这种平衡解释了为什么钒和钼氧化物在实验中被观察到是最活跃和最选择性的催化剂。

位点隔离：虽然在给定的文献中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离是解决选择性问题的一个重要概念。它涉及隔离活性位点以防止产物过度氧化，这可能会提高所需含氧化合物的产率。

总之，ODH过程的效率受到催化剂选择、主导反应机理以及平衡反应性和选择性能力的共同影响。克服高温下低产率的挑战仍然是提高该过程工业可行性的关键焦点。
