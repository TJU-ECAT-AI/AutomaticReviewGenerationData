[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."

[2] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities. In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."

[3] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6). An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."

[4] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[5] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[6] "Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the CH bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites: terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated vs polynuclear species (Scheme 8)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst types, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, as the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than that of the starting alkane. This necessitates operating at low conversions to maintain high selectivities.

Various catalysts have been investigated for ODH, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Bulk metal oxides like V2O5 show low yields, while supported systems generally demonstrate higher activity and selectivity. Notable catalysts include MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO, which exhibit relatively high selectivities. The most effective catalyst for ODH, particularly for propane, is VOx supported on oxide materials, with MoOx supported catalysts emerging as competitive alternatives.

The reaction mechanisms in ODH primarily involve C-H bond activation, which is consistently identified as the rate-determining step. Two main pathways have been proposed:

1. Formation of M-alkyl intermediates: C-H bond activation leads to M-alkyl intermediates, which decompose to 1-alkene through β-H abstraction by a surface oxygen atom.

2. Concerted 2H-abstraction: This mechanism is analogous to the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts.

The efficiency of the ODH process is significantly influenced by the interplay between these factors. The choice of catalyst affects both activity and selectivity, while the reaction mechanism determines the pathway and potential intermediates. Process conditions, such as temperature and conversion levels, must be carefully controlled to balance selectivity and yield.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The distance between active sites on the catalyst surface correlates with the selectivity between dehydrogenation and formation of oxygenated products. Proper site isolation helps prevent overoxidation and improves selectivity towards the desired alkene products.

In summary, the efficiency of the ODH process is a result of the complex interplay between catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. Optimizing these factors, with particular attention to site isolation, is key to developing more effective ODH processes with improved selectivity and conversion.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂类型、反应机理和工艺条件。ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率，因为烯烃产物的氧化通常比起始烷烃更快。这就需要在低转化率下操作以保持高选择性。

研究人员已经探索了各种ODH催化剂，包括大体金属氧化物和负载型体系。大体金属氧化物如V2O5产率较低，而负载型体系通常表现出更高的活性和选择性。值得注意的催化剂包括MOP（M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe）、VMgOx、VSiZrOx和CrSiMO，它们表现出相对较高的选择性。对于ODH，特别是丙烷的ODH，最有效的催化剂是负载在氧化物材料上的VOx，而负载型MoOx催化剂正成为有竞争力的替代品。

ODH的反应机理主要涉及C-H键活化，这一步骤被一致认为是反应的决速步骤。主要提出了两种反应路径：

1. M-烷基中间体的形成：C-H键活化导致M-烷基中间体的形成，然后通过表面氧原子的β-H抽提分解成1-烯烃。

2. 协同2H-抽提：这种机理类似于VPO催化剂上烷烃的选择性氧化。

ODH过程的效率受到这些因素相互作用的显著影响。催化剂的选择影响活性和选择性，而反应机理决定了反应路径和潜在的中间体。必须仔细控制工艺条件，如温度和转化率水平，以平衡选择性和产率。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。催化剂表面上活性位点之间的距离与脱氢和含氧产物形成之间的选择性相关。适当的位点隔离有助于防止过度氧化并提高对所需烯烃产物的选择性。

总之，ODH过程的效率是催化剂性质、反应机理和工艺条件复杂相互作用的结果。优化这些因素，特别是注意位点隔离，是开发更有效的ODH过程、提高选择性和转化率的关键。
