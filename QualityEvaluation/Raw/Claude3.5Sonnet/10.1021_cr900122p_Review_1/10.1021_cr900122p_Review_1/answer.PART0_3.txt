[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."

[2] "Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities. In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."

[3] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6). An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts (vide supra, Scheme 5b)."

[4] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[5] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[6] "Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the CH bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites: terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated vs polynuclear species (Scheme 8)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is difficult because the oxidation of the alkene product is often faster than the oxidation of the starting alkane, necessitating operation at low conversions to maintain high selectivities.

Various catalysts have been investigated for ODH, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Supported systems, particularly those based on VOx, generally show higher activity and selectivity compared to bulk metal oxides. Other systems like MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), VMgOx, VSiZrOx, and CrSiMO have also shown promising results with relatively high selectivities.

The reaction mechanism in ODH primarily involves C-H bond activation, which has been identified as the rate-determining step across different catalytic systems. Two main mechanisms have been proposed:

1. Formation of M-alkyl intermediates: C-H bond activation leads to M-alkyl intermediates, which then decompose to form 1-alkene through β-H abstraction by a surface oxygen atom.

2. Concerted 2H-abstraction: This mechanism is analogous to what has been observed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts.

The efficiency of the ODH process is significantly influenced by the interplay between these reaction mechanisms and the nature of the catalyst. The structure of the active sites, whether they are terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated or polynuclear, plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway.

Site isolation has been identified as a key factor in addressing selectivity issues. The distance between active sites correlates with the selectivity of dehydrogenation versus the formation of oxygenated products. This implies that catalysts with well-dispersed, isolated active sites are more likely to achieve higher selectivities in ODH reactions.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is a result of a delicate balance between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and active site structure. Ongoing research in this field aims to develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity at increased conversion rates, with a focus on supported systems and the optimization of site isolation.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程。ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。这很困难，因为烯烃产物的氧化通常比起始烷烃的氧化更快，因此需要在低转化率下操作以保持高选择性。

研究人员已经调查了各种ODH催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统。与块状金属氧化物相比，负载型系统，特别是基于VOx的系统，通常表现出更高的活性和选择性。其他系统如MOP（M = Ti、Zr、V、Fe）、VMgOx、VSiZrOx和CrSiMO也显示出令人满意的结果，具有相对较高的选择性。

ODH的反应机理主要涉及C-H键活化，在不同的催化系统中都被认为是决速步骤。提出了两种主要机制：

1. 形成M-烷基中间体：C-H键活化导致形成M-烷基中间体，然后通过表面氧原子的β-H抽提分解形成1-烯烃。

2. 协同2H-抽提：这种机制类似于在VPO催化剂上观察到的烷烃选择性氧化机制。

ODH过程的效率受这些反应机制和催化剂性质之间相互作用的显著影响。活性位点的结构，无论是末端金属氧还是μ-氧物种，孤立的还是多核的，都在决定反应途径中起着关键作用。

位点隔离被认为是解决选择性问题的一个关键因素。活性位点之间的距离与脱氢选择性和含氧产物形成之间存在相关性。这意味着具有良好分散、孤立活性位点的催化剂更有可能在ODH反应中实现更高的选择性。

总之，ODH过程的效率是催化剂组成、反应条件和活性位点结构之间微妙平衡的结果。该领域的持续研究旨在开发能够在提高转化率的同时保持高选择性的催化剂，重点关注负载型系统和位点隔离的优化。
