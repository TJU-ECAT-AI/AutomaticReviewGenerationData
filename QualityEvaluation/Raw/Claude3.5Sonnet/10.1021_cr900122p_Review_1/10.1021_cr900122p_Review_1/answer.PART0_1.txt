[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."

[2] "ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity;"

[3] "In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."

[4] "It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6). An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts"

[5] "The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

[6] "These systems are characterized by the presence of isolated sites or small clusters at a low surface coverage; with bulk oxides being formed only at higher surface coverage (above a monolayer)."

[7] "Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the CH bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites: terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated vs polynuclear species (Scheme 8)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst choice, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used as catalysts, with supported systems generally showing higher activity and selectivity.

A key challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity while maintaining high conversion. The oxidation of the alkene product tends to be faster than that of the starting alkane, necessitating operation at low conversions to achieve high selectivities. This trade-off between selectivity and conversion is a significant limitation on process efficiency.

The reaction mechanism involves C-H bond activation as the rate-determining step. Two main pathways have been proposed: 
1) Formation of M-alkyl intermediates followed by β-H abstraction
2) A concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism

The exact mechanism can vary depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The distance between active sites on the catalyst surface correlates with the selectivity between dehydrogenation and formation of oxygenated products. Isolated sites or small clusters at low surface coverage tend to favor the desired reaction pathway.

Supported transition-metal oxides, particularly those of groups 5 and 6 (e.g., VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, WOx), have been extensively studied for ODH. These catalysts can exist as isolated sites, small clusters, or bulk oxides depending on the surface coverage.

The structure of the active sites (terminal metal oxo, μ-oxo species, isolated or polynuclear species) influences the reaction pathway and, consequently, the process efficiency. Understanding and controlling these factors is crucial for developing more effective ODH catalysts and processes.

Overall, the interplay between catalyst choice, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions in ODH presents both challenges and opportunities for improving process efficiency. Balancing these factors to achieve high selectivity and conversion remains an active area of research in catalysis and chemical engineering.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂的选择、反应机理和工艺条件。块状金属氧化物和负载型系统都被用作催化剂，其中负载型系统通常表现出更高的活性和选择性。

ODH的一个关键挑战是在保持高转化率的同时实现高选择性。烯烃产物的氧化往往比起始烷烃的氧化更快，这就需要在低转化率下操作以获得高选择性。这种选择性和转化率之间的权衡是限制过程效率的一个重要因素。

反应机理涉及C-H键活化作为速率决定步骤。主要提出了两种途径：
1）形成M-烷基中间体，随后进行β-H抽提
2）协同的2H-抽提机理

具体机理可能因催化剂和反应条件而异。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。催化剂表面上活性位点之间的距离与脱氢和含氧产物形成之间的选择性相关。低表面覆盖率下的孤立位点或小簇倾向于有利于所需的反应途径。

负载型过渡金属氧化物，特别是第5和第6族的氧化物（如VOx、NbOx、CrOx、MoOx、WOx），已被广泛研究用于ODH。这些催化剂可以以孤立位点、小簇或块状氧化物的形式存在，取决于表面覆盖率。

活性位点的结构（末端金属氧、μ-氧物种、孤立或多核物种）影响反应途径，从而影响过程效率。理解和控制这些因素对于开发更有效的ODH催化剂和工艺至关重要。

总的来说，ODH中催化剂选择、反应机理和工艺条件之间的相互作用既带来挑战，也提供了改善工艺效率的机会。平衡这些因素以实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是催化和化学工程领域的一个活跃研究方向。
