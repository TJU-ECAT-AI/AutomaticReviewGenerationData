Abstract 
The mechanism 
of the partial oxidation 
of methane 
to formaldehdye 
with 0, 
has been investigated 
on bulk and 
differently 
loaded silica supported 
(4-7 
wt%) MOO, and (5-50 
wt%o> V,O, 
catalysts 
at 600-650C 
in a pulse reactor 
connected 
to a quadrupole 
mass spectrometer. 
The reaction rate and product distribution 
in the presence and in the absence 
ol gas-phase 0, have been evaluated. On bare SiO,, low and medium loaded silica supported MOO, and V,O, catalysts the 
reaction proceeds 
via a concerted 
mechanism 
involving 
the activation 
of gas-phase 
oxygen on the reduced 
sites of the 
catalyst 
surface as proved by the direct correlation 
between 
catalytic activity and density 
of reduced sites evaluated 
in 
steady-state 
conditions, 
while on highly loaded catalysts 
as well as on bulk MOO, and V,O, 
the reaction 
rate drops 
dramatically 
and the reaction 
pathway 
via redox mechanism 
becomes predominant. 
The results indicate that the surface 
mechanism 
is essentially 
more effective 
than the redox mechanism 
enabling also a higher selectivity 
to HCHO.

1. Introduction 
Notwithstanding 
the great research effort, the 
working mechanism 
of bulk and supported 
ox- 
ide catalysts in the partial oxidation 
of methane 
to formaldehyde 
with molecular 
oxygen (MPO) 
still remains 
undecided. 
A number 
of studies 
based on the use of transient 
kinetic 
[ 1,2] and 
isotopic 
labelling 
techniques 
[3-61 have been 
addressed 
to ascertain 
the

pathway 
in the MPO on bulk and silica sup- 
ported V,O, and MOO, catalysts. However, 
iso- 
topic techniques 
do not provide definitive 
proof 
about the participation 
of lattice or surface acti- 
vated gas-phase 
oxygen 
in the product forma- 
tion since the reaction 
products 
(HCHO 
and 
CO,) 
undergo 
fast isotopic 
exchange 
with la- 
belled oxygen 
[2,6] and therefore 
no definitive 
conclusions 
have been drawn about the occur- 
rence of a redox (Mars-van 
Krevelen model) or 
surface (Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
model) mech- 
anism [ 1,3,6]. Various physico-chemical

in situ LRS have been used in order to corre- 
late the redox properties of such transition metal 
oxide catalysts with their reactivity and to high- 
light the nature of the active sites [5,7,8]. Smith 
and Ozkan [9] concluded 
that the MPO on bulk 
MOO, is a structure sensitive reaction claiming 
that MO = 0 sites are responsible for production 
of HCHO, 
while MO-O-MO 
bridging 
oxygen 
sites promote total oxidation. 
Banares et al. [8] 
reported 
that the active sites of MoOJSiO, 
catalysts leading to HCHO lie in polymolybdate 
moieties, while Smith and Ozkan [5] stated that 
such selective 
sites are associated 
with highly 
dispersed 
silicomolybdic 
species. Similarly, 
no 
direct 
and 
definitive 
evidences 
have 
been 
achieved 
about the active sites of V,O,/SiO, 
catalysts 
since it is speculated 
that highly dis- 
persed tetrahedral 
surface vanadia species cat- 
alyze the primary oxidation reaction, whereas 0 
associated 
with the bulk-like 
vanadia and with 
the SiO, 
lattice is involved 
in the secondary 
oxidation 
reactions 
of HCHO or CO [6]. How- 
ever, ruling out the occurrence 
of purely homo- 
geneous and/or 
surface assisted gas-phase reac- 
tion pathways, 
it is evident that the step-wise 
redox mechanism 
can rationalize 
the catalytic 
action of transition metal oxides which are able 
to provide lattice oxygen through a cyclic reduc- 
tion/oxidation 
scheme, 
while it is absolutely 
inadequate 
to explain 
the action of the SiO, 
surface in catalyzing 
the MPO reaction 
[ 10,111. 
On this account, 
we have proposed 
that silica 
based 
oxide 
catalysts 
have 
the capability 
to 
provide activation 
of gas-phase oxygen into ac- 
tive species 
by reduced 
sites of the catalyst 
surface [12]. In particular, 
since the direct rela- 
tionship 
between 
the density 
of reduced 
sites 
and the reactivity 
of such oxide catalysts, 
we 
have argued that the MPO on bare SiO, 
and 
medium-loaded 
silica supported MOO, and V,O, 
catalysts 
proceeds 
via a concerted 
mechanism 
without participation 
of lattice oxygen [12]. As 
it has been ascertained 
that the catalytic 
be- 
haviour 
of silica supported 
MOO, 
and V,O, 
catalysts 
is controlled 
by the extent 
of oxide 
loading [8,13], this paper deals with a compara- 
tive study of the reaction 
mechanism 
of the 
MPO on bulk and differently 
loaded silica sup- 
ported MOO, and V,O, 
catalysts 
in order to 
highlight the reasons for their different catalytic 
action.

all the catalysts were 
dried overnight

Then, for such samples

calculated on the basis of 0, uptake correspond- 
ing to the difference

3. Results and discussion 
3. I. General 
The key point of the mechanistic 
studies of 
MPO on oxide catalysts is to ascertain the ori- 
gin of the oxygen 
incorporated 
in the reaction 
products. Indeed, the direct participation 
of the 
lattice oxygen proves the occurrence 
of a step- 
wise redox mechanism while the involvement 
of 
the surface 
activated 
gas-phase 
0, 
probes 
a 
concerted 
or a two-site 
surface 
reaction 
path 
[14]. As the attempts 
made to elucidate 
the 
oxygen 
insertion 
pathway 
under 
steady-state 
conditions 
resulted 
not completely 
convincing 
[3,6], a valid and alternative 
approach 
which 
could contribute 
to shed light into this issue is 
that based on the evaluation 
of the reaction rate 
in the mixture of reactants (CH, + 0,) 
and in 
the absence of gas-phase 
0,

count, it has been documented 
that the presence 
of 0,

the rate of product formation 
when the reaction 
proceeds via a step-wise redox mechanism 
[15]. 
Then, a series of pulse reaction 
tests in the 
MPO on bulk and differently 
loaded silica sup- 
ported MOO, and V,O, catalysts in the presence 
and in the absence of gas-phase 
0, 
has been 
carried out. Care was taken to avoid during the 
pulsing a decline of the state of the catalytic 
surface from the steady-state 
conditions. 
This 
was checked by pulsing reaction mixture (CH, 
+ 0,) before and after reducing pulse (CH,). 
In order to probe the reliability 
of the kinetic 
data obtained by Pulse reaction tests, a signifi- 
cant comparison 
of reaction 
rate and product 
selectivity 
values attained at 650C on various 
catalytic systems by pulse (PR) and continuous 
flow (CF) reactors is outlined in Table 2. It is 
evident that in spite of the transient regime of 
the pulse reaction 
technique 
the activity 
data 
obtained by the two methods are analogous or at 
least similar in terms of both reaction rate and 
product distribution. 
3.2. VPS catalysts 
The activity 
data of PS, V and differently 
loaded VPS catalysts in the presence and in the 
absence of gas-phase oxygen, expressed in terms 
of reaction rate on unit oxide or catalyst weight 
basis and product 
distribution, 
are compara- 
tively shown in Table 3. 
These data indicate that (i) the bare PS cata- 
lyst in absence of gas-phase 0, 
is not effective 
in the MPO at 600C while at 650C it enables a 
reaction rate value which is two orders of mag- 
nitude 
lower 
than that measured 
in the full

addition 
up to a 
loading of 20 wt% implies a promoting 
effect 
on the activity 
of the PS carrier even if the 
optimum loading, ensuring the best HCHO yield, 
corresponds 
to the 5 wt%; (iii) on highly loaded 
(;> 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO, 
samples, 
the drop in 
activity is not counterbalanced 
by a correspond- 
ing increase in the HCHO selectivity; 
(iv) bulk 
V:!O, possesses 
a similar activity 
in the pres- 
ence and in the absence of gas-phase 
0,. 
Be- 
sides, it can be noted that the extent 
of the 
reaction rate in full reaction mixture and in CH, 
depends upon the V,O, loading. A clear picture 
of such an effect 
is presented 
in Fig. 
1 by 
plotting the ratio (R, r,/rO) 
between 
the value 
of the reaction rate in the absence (ri) 
and in 
the presence 
(rO) of gas-phase 
0, 
at 650C 
against 
the V,O, 
loading. 
It results 
that the 
value of R increases 
steadily 
up to a V,O, 
loading 
of 20%, thereafter 
it levels 
off to a 
value of ca. 0.6 for VPS 50 and bulk V samples. 
The above findings clearly 
suggest that PS (R 
= 0.023) and VPS 5 (R = 0.15) catalysts act in 
the MPO via a surface mechanism likely involv- 
ing the activation 
of gas-phase 
O,, 
while for 
highly loaded VPS catalysts 
the redox mecha- 
nism concurs to the overall reaction rate becom- 
ing even prevailing 
for VPS 20, VPS 50 and V 
sa.mples (R = 0.6). The reactivity 
of the cata- 
lysts in the absence 
of gas-phase 
0, 
can be 
directly related to the capability 
of the solid to 
provide lattice oxygen allowing the formation of 
reaction products. 
From the above data (Table 
3) it arises that the increase in the V,O, loading 
implies the shift of the reaction pathway from 
concerted 
to redox mechanism 
with a remark- 
able decrease in the overall catalytic activity. In 
fact, the V,O, loading rise from 5% (VPS 5) to 
100% (V) results in a drop of the reaction rate 
of about three orders of magnitude 
per gram of 
oxide. Such an effect cannot be explained 
by 
invoking the different 
surface area of supported 
and bulk V,O, catalysts. The active centers for 
oxygen 
activation 
on low and medium loaded 
V,O,/SiO, 
catalysts could be V ions with low 
coordination 
number stabilized on the silica sur- 
face [12]. Such active sites promote the forma- 
tion of partially 
reduced 
very 
active 
surface 
oxygen species which participate in the reaction 
instead to undergo a deep reduction up to lattice 
ions [ 121. Then, 
it can be argued 
that V,O, 
loadings higher than 5% imply the formation 
of 
large surface vanadia clusters as crystals of bulk 
V,O, causing a gradual decrease of low coordi- 
nated V centers and a concomitant 
enhancement 
in the amounts 
of extractable 
lattice oxygen 
[ 161. These structural 
modifications 
induce the 
shift of the reaction path from the concerted 
to 
the redox model. 
Further 
insights 
into the different 
catalytic 
behaviour 
of medium 
and highly loaded VPS 
catalysts, 
bare PS and bulk V samples can be 
achieved by evaluating 
the product distribution 
presented in Tables 2 and 3 at comparable 
level 
of activity 
and taking into account the inverse 
relationship 
between 
activity 
and selectivity. 
Namely, it emerges that the selectivity to HCHO 
of V and highly loaded (> 10%) VPS catalysts 
is essentially 
lower than that of PS and VPS 5 
samples. 
This finding 
allows to infer that the 
redox mechanism, 
which is prevailing for highly 
loaded VPS catalysts, 
leads mainly to the for- 
mation of CO, while the concerted 
mechanism 
(bare PS and VPS 5 samples) implies the forma- 
tion of HCHO as primary product [ 121.

It is evident that the addition of MOO, causes 
a decrease in the activity of the bare PS carrier, 
more enhanced 
at higher oxide loading, along 
with a slight improvement 
in the HCHO selec- 
tivity likely accounted for by the lower extent of 
methane conversion

Also for MPS catalysts 
the MOO, loading 
controls the extent of the reaction 
rate in the 
absence of gas-phase

as evidenced 
by 
the plot of R against MOO, loading outlined in 
Fig. 2. It can be observed 
that for MPS 4 and 
MPS 7 samples the value of R ranges between 
0.1 and 0.25. These 
results 
confirm 
that the 
lattice oxygen of Moo,-based 
catalysts is rather 
inactive up to 650C [ 171 and then any interac- 
tion between 
CH, 
and the catalyst 
surface is 
hindered. Therefore, 
it can be concluded

for supported MPS catalysts, becomes predomi-

3.4. Density of reduced sites and oxygen path- 
way 
In previous 
papers dealing 
with the factors 
controlling 
the reactivity 
of silica-based 
oxide 
catalysts in the MPO [ 121, we disclosed a direct 
relationship 
between 
catalytic 
activity and oxy- 
gen uptake under steady state reaction 
condi- 
tions pointing out that such property governs the 
catalytic 
behaviour 
of MPO catalysts. 
Then, in 
order to find out whether such a relationship 
is 
valid for any MPO catalyst, 
the density of re- 
duced sites (p) of the studied catalysts has been 
evaluated and correlated 
with the catalytic activ- 
itv. The values of p and ptot at 600 and 650C 
are listed in Table 5. 
The above data indicate that: (i) both the total 
and irreversible 
oxygen 
uptake 
under 
steady- 
state 
reaction 
conditions 
increase 
with V,O, 
loading reaching 
a maximum 
at loadings com- 
prised between 20 (VPS 20) and 50% (VPS 501, 
thereafter 
they decrease for the bulk V system, 
(ii) the difference 
between 
ptor and p for VPS 
catalysts 
becomes 
progressively 
more 
pro- 
nounced 
at higher V,O, 
loadings and (iii) the 
addition of MOO, implies a decrease in density 
of reduced sites of the bare PS sample, without 
any difference 
in the values of ptot and p. Then, 
the opposite effects exerted by MOO, and V,O, 
on the activity of the bare PS carrier parallels 
the density of reduced sites of the catalysts [12]. 
In other 
words, 
V,O,, 
resulting 
an effective 
promoter 
of the activity of the bare PS, allows 
the stabilization 
of a higher density of reduced 
sites owing 
to its easier 
reducibility 
under 
reaction 
conditions 
[ 171 whereas Moo,, 
being 
essentially 
non-reducible 
under reaction 
condi- 
tions [ 12,171, depresses the activity of the under- 
lying PS carrier because of a negative physical 
effect 
due to a partial 
coverage 
of the own 
active sites of the silica surface [12,17]. How- 
ever, it is evident that the data reported in Table 
5 do not fully account for the activity of differ- 
ently loaded VPS catalysts in the MPO (Table 
3) as the activity of VPS catalysts reaches the 
maximum 
on VPS 5 sample, while the density 
of reduced 
sites increases 
up to a loading 
of 
20% (VPS 20) thereafter 
it levels off (VPS 50). 
In addition, the larger difference 
between p and 
pmt (Table 5) for highly loaded VPS catalysts, 
which is related to the capability 
of such sys-

terns to release constitutional 
oxygen [16], al- 
lows to state that their higher reducibility 
is 
ineffective 
in the MPO. 
Evidently, 
on such 
highly loaded VPS catalysts the high density of 
reduced 
sites favours 
a rapid incorporation 
of 
the surface 
oxygen 
species 
into oxide 
lattice 
[15]. As the lattice oxygen is much less reactive 
than the surface 
oxygen 
species, 
the reaction 
rate of the MPO proceeding 
via redox mecha- 
nism is much lower than that observed 
when a 
concerted 
mechanism 
occurs. 
For the bare PS sample, exhibiting a very low 
mobility 
of lattice oxygen 
[17], the surface 
mechanism 
well accounts for the formation 
of 
products. 
Then, the activity 
of this sample is 
controlled 
by the extent 
of the density 
of re- 
duced sites as confirmed by the analogous trends 
of reaction rate and p with temperature 
shown 
in Fig. 3. 
Whilst, assuming 
that the value of p is the 
density of reduced active sites generated under 
steady-state 
reaction conditions, 
different 
trends 
of reaction rate and p with the oxide loading are 
found 
for VPS (a) and MPS (b) catalysts 
as 
shown in Fig. 4. Namely, 
taking into account 
the bare PS as reference 
system working in the 
MPO according 
to the surface 
mechanism, 
it 
arises that the addition 
of MOO, 
negatively 
affects both p and reaction 
rate and then their 
parallel decreasing 
trends with the oxide loading 
(Fig. 4b) indicate that also on the MPS systems 
the MPO 
mainly 
proceeds 
according 
to the 
surface mechanism. 
A very low activity of the 
bulk M system at 650C not accounted for by a 
corresponding 
decrease in p (Fig. 4b) signals a 
change 
in the reaction 
mechanism 
from 
the 
surface to the less effective 
redox model. The 
sudden growth in activity along with the moder- 
ate increase in p (Fig. 4a) observed for the VPS 
5 catalyst suggest that at medium loading vana- 
dia exerts a positive influence on the functional- 
ity of the PS support probably 
because 
of the 
stabilization 
of dispersed 
surface 
species 
en- 
abling the formation 
of very active surface re- 
duced sites. By contrast, the redox mechanism 
becomes 
predominant 
for highly 
loaded VPS 
catalysts and bulk V system as confirmed by the 
lack of a direct relationship 
between 
reaction 
rate and p (Fig. 4a). 
4. Conclusions 
On pure silica and low and medium loaded 
(2 5 wt%) V,O,/SiO, 
and MoO,/SiO, 
cata- 
lysts the MPO proceeds via a concerted 
mecha- 
nism without participation 
of lattice oxygen. 
A 
direct relationship 
between 
density 
of reduced 
sites and activity 
proves 
the crucial 
role 
of 
gas-phase 
oxygen 
activation 
in the main reac- 
tion pathway.

MoOJSiO, 
catalysts as well as on bulk V,O, 
and MOO, systems the two-step redox mecha- 
nism, involving the direct participation 
of lattice 
oxygen, 
is predominant. 
No relationship 
be- 
tween 
density 
of reduced 
sites and catalytic 
activity is found indicating then that the interac- 
tion of gas-phase oxygen with the catalyst sur- 
face does not lead to the formation 
of active 
surface oxygen 
species, 
resulting 
instead in a 
quickly incorporation 
of 0, into oxide lattice.
