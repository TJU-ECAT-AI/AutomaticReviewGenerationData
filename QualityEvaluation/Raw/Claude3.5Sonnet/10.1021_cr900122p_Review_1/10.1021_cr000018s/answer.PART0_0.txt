[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. As illustrated below for the case of propane conversion to propene, the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2"

[2] "While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion."

[3] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[4] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[5] "Although a large body of literature exists on the ODH of alkanes, current understanding of the elementary processes involved in both the formation of alkenes and their subsequent combustion is limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding concerning the relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising method for producing alkenes, but faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The main challenge is to maximize alkene yield while minimizing unwanted combustion reactions that produce CO2.

Various catalysts have been studied for ODH, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Oxide catalysts can achieve high alkene selectivity (>80%) at low conversion levels, but selectivity decreases as conversion increases. For supported metal oxides, more basic supports help mitigate this selectivity decline.

Research on vanadia catalysts has shown that ODH requires large vanadia domains. However, these large domains also promote propene combustion, while smaller domains promote propane combustion. This highlights the complex interplay between catalyst structure and reactivity.

The reaction mechanisms for ODH are not fully understood. Proposed steps include C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and hydrogen abstraction. However, there is limited knowledge about how catalyst composition and structure relate to activity and selectivity.

Site isolation may help address selectivity issues by controlling the size and distribution of active sites. However, more research is needed to fully optimize catalyst design and understand structure-activity relationships in ODH.

Overall, while ODH shows promise, significant challenges remain in catalyst development to achieve high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. A deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms and catalyst structure-function relationships is needed to improve process efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是生产烯烃的一种有前景的方法，但在同时实现高选择性和高转化率方面面临挑战。主要挑战是最大化烯烃产率，同时最小化生成CO2的不需要的燃烧反应。

研究人员已经研究了各种ODH催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统。氧化物催化剂在低转化水平下可以达到高烯烃选择性（>80%），但随着转化率的增加，选择性会下降。对于负载型金属氧化物，更碱性的载体有助于减缓这种选择性下降。

对钒氧化物催化剂的研究表明，ODH需要大的钒氧化物结构域。然而，这些大的结构域也促进丙烯的燃烧，而小的结构域则促进丙烷的燃烧。这突出了催化剂结构和反应性之间的复杂相互作用。

ODH的反应机理尚未完全理解。提出的步骤包括C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成和氢抽提。然而，关于催化剂组成和结构如何与活性和选择性相关的知识还很有限。

位点隔离可能有助于通过控制活性位点的大小和分布来解决选择性问题。然而，还需要更多的研究来全面优化催化剂设计并理解ODH中的结构-活性关系。

总的来说，虽然ODH显示出前景，但在催化剂开发方面仍然存在重大挑战，以同时实现高选择性和高转化率。需要更深入地理解反应机理和催化剂结构-功能关系，以提高工艺效率。
