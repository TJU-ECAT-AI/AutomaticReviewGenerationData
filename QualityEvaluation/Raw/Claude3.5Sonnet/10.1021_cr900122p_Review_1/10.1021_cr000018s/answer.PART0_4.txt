[1] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[2] "While a large body of literature exists on the ODH of alkanes, current understanding of the elementary processes involved in both the formation of alkenes and their subsequent combustion is limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding concerning the relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity."

[3] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts. The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."

[4] "Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. The interplay between different catalyst types, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, significantly impacts the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process.

One of the main challenges in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. As alkane conversion increases, olefin selectivity tends to decrease. However, this decline in selectivity can be mitigated by increasing the basicity of the support for supported metal oxide catalysts. This observation highlights the importance of catalyst support properties in influencing reaction outcomes.

The reaction mechanisms involved in ODH are not fully understood, but they likely involve C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps. The limited understanding of these elementary processes and their relationship to catalyst composition and structure presents a significant barrier to optimizing ODH catalysts.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues in ODH. By controlling the distribution and isolation of active sites on the catalyst surface, it is possible to influence the reaction pathways and improve selectivity. For example, in the case of vanadium phosphate catalysts used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, increasing the phosphorus to vanadium ratio leads to higher selectivity. This effect is attributed to the stabilization of vanadium in the 4+ oxidation state, which is believed to be the active form for selective oxidation.

The process efficiency of ODH is a result of the complex interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions. Factors such as the nature of the active metal, support properties, and the presence of promoters or modifiers all contribute to the overall performance. By carefully tuning these parameters, researchers aim to develop catalysts that can achieve high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, making ODH a more viable process for industrial applications.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and improving ODH catalysts, there is still much to learn about the fundamental mechanisms and structure-activity relationships. Future research should focus on developing a more comprehensive understanding of these aspects to design more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODH of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。不同类型催化剂(包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统)之间的相互作用对ODH过程的效率和选择性产生显著影响。

ODH的主要挑战之一是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。随着烷烃转化率的增加，烯烃选择性往往会降低。然而，通过增加负载型金属氧化物催化剂支撑体的碱性，可以减缓这种选择性下降。这一观察结果突出了催化剂支撑体性质在影响反应结果方面的重要性。

ODH涉及的反应机理尚未完全理解，但可能包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提步骤。对这些基本过程及其与催化剂组成和结构关系的有限理解，是优化ODH催化剂的一个重大障碍。

位点隔离在解决ODH选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过控制催化剂表面活性位点的分布和隔离，可以影响反应路径并提高选择性。例如，在用于丁烷氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的钒磷催化剂中，增加磷与钒的比例可以提高选择性。这种效果被归因于钒在4+氧化态的稳定化，据信这是选择性氧化的活性形式。

ODH的过程效率是催化剂组成、结构和反应条件复杂相互作用的结果。活性金属的性质、支撑体特性以及助剂或改性剂的存在等因素都会影响整体性能。通过仔细调整这些参数，研究人员旨在开发能够同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂，使ODH成为更可行的工业应用过程。

总之，虽然在理解和改进ODH催化剂方面取得了重大进展，但对基本机理和结构-活性关系的认识仍有待深入。未来的研究应该集中在发展对这些方面更全面的理解上，以设计出更高效、更具选择性的烷烃ODH催化剂。
