          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. As illustrated below for the case of propane conversion to propene, the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2"

[2] "While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion."

[3] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[4] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[5] "Although a large body of literature exists on the ODH of alkanes, current understanding of the elementary processes involved in both the formation of alkenes and their subsequent combustion is limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding concerning the relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity."

[6] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[7] "Some progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been reported recently for metal oxide-supported vanadia."

[8] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts. The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."

[9] "Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

1. Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with vanadia-based catalysts being prominent. The size and distribution of active sites play a crucial role, as larger vanadia domains are required for ODH but also promote unwanted combustion reactions.

2. Selectivity-conversion trade-off: A major challenge is the inverse relationship between alkene selectivity and alkane conversion. As conversion increases, selectivity typically decreases due to over-oxidation of the desired alkene products.

3. Support effects: The basicity of the support material influences selectivity, with more basic supports generally leading to better selectivity maintenance at higher conversions.

4. Catalyst structure: ODH requires large vanadia domains. However, these large domains also promote propene combustion, while smaller domains favor propane combustion. This highlights the delicate balance needed in catalyst design.

5. Reaction mechanisms: While not fully understood, the process likely involves C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent hydrogen abstraction. The exact mechanisms and their relationships to catalyst properties remain unclear.

6. Site isolation: This concept is implicitly important in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, unwanted secondary reactions like combustion can be minimized.

7. Composition effects: In some cases, such as vanadium phosphate catalysts, increasing the ratio of certain elements (e.g., phosphorus to vanadium) can lead to improved selectivity, possibly due to stabilization of specific oxidation states.

The interplay of these factors significantly impacts overall efficiency. Understanding and optimizing these relationships is crucial for developing more effective ODH catalysts and processes. However, the complexity of the reaction network and the limitations in understanding elementary processes hinder optimization efforts, necessitating further research into structure-activity relationships and reaction mechanisms.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

1. 催化剂：使用了体相金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中钒基催化剂最为突出。活性位点的大小和分布起着至关重要的作用，较大的钒氧化物域是ODH所必需的，但也促进了不需要的燃烧反应。

2. 选择性-转化率权衡：主要挑战是烯烃选择性与烷烃转化率之间的反比关系。随着转化率的增加，选择性通常会下降，这是由于所需烯烃产物的过度氧化。

3. 载体效应：载体材料的碱性影响选择性，更碱性的载体通常能在较高转化率下保持更好的选择性。

4. 催化剂结构：ODH需要大的钒氧化物结构域。然而，这些大结构域也促进丙烯的燃烧，而小结构域则有利于丙烷的燃烧。这突出了催化剂设计中需要的微妙平衡。

5. 反应机理：虽然尚未完全理解，但该过程可能涉及C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成以及随后的氢原子抽取。确切的机理及其与催化剂性质的关系仍不清楚。

6. 位点隔离：这个概念在解决选择性问题时隐含重要。通过隔离活性位点，可以最大限度地减少不需要的二次反应，如燃烧。

7. 组成效应：在某些情况下，如钒磷催化剂，增加某些元素的比例（例如磷与钒的比例）可以提高选择性，这可能是由于特定氧化态的稳定化。

这些因素的相互作用显著影响整体效率。理解和优化这些关系对开发更有效的ODH催化剂和过程至关重要。然而，反应网络的复杂性和对基本过程理解的局限性阻碍了优化努力，需要进一步研究结构-活性关系和反应机理。
