[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. As illustrated below for the case of propane conversion to propene, the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2"

[2] "While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion."

[3] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[4] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[5] "Although a large body of literature exists on the ODH of alkanes, current understanding of the elementary processes involved in both the formation of alkenes and their subsequent combustion is limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding concerning the relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising method for producing alkenes, but faces challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The main challenge is to maximize alkene yield while minimizing unwanted combustion reactions that produce CO2.

Various catalysts have been studied for ODH, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems. Oxide catalysts can achieve high alkene selectivity (>80%) at low conversion levels, but selectivity decreases as conversion increases. For supported metal oxides, more basic supports help mitigate this selectivity decline.

Research on vanadia catalysts has shown that ODH requires large vanadia domains. However, these large domains also promote propene combustion, while smaller domains promote propane combustion. This highlights the complex interplay between catalyst structure and reactivity.

The reaction mechanisms for ODH are not fully understood. Proposed steps include C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and hydrogen abstraction. However, there is limited knowledge about how catalyst composition and structure relate to activity and selectivity.

Site isolation may help address selectivity issues by controlling the size and distribution of active sites. However, more research is needed to fully optimize catalyst design and understand structure-activity relationships in ODH.

Overall, while ODH shows promise, significant challenges remain in catalyst development to achieve high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. A deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms and catalyst structure-function relationships is needed to improve process efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是生产烯烃的一种有前景的方法，但在同时实现高选择性和高转化率方面面临挑战。主要挑战是最大化烯烃产率，同时最小化生成CO2的不需要的燃烧反应。

研究人员已经研究了各种ODH催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统。氧化物催化剂在低转化水平下可以达到高烯烃选择性（>80%），但随着转化率的增加，选择性会下降。对于负载型金属氧化物，更碱性的载体有助于减缓这种选择性下降。

对钒氧化物催化剂的研究表明，ODH需要大的钒氧化物结构域。然而，这些大的结构域也促进丙烯的燃烧，而小的结构域则促进丙烷的燃烧。这突出了催化剂结构和反应性之间的复杂相互作用。

ODH的反应机理尚未完全理解。提出的步骤包括C-H键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成和氢抽提。然而，关于催化剂组成和结构如何与活性和选择性相关的知识还很有限。

位点隔离可能有助于通过控制活性位点的大小和分布来解决选择性问题。然而，还需要更多的研究来全面优化催化剂设计并理解ODH中的结构-活性关系。

总的来说，虽然ODH显示出前景，但在催化剂开发方面仍然存在重大挑战，以同时实现高选择性和高转化率。需要更深入地理解反应机理和催化剂结构-功能关系，以提高工艺效率。

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported catalysts are used. Supported metal oxides, particularly vanadia-based catalysts, have been extensively studied. The support's basicity affects selectivity decline with increasing conversion.

Challenges: The main challenge is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. As alkane conversion increases, alkene selectivity typically decreases. This trade-off is a key issue in ODH processes.

Reaction mechanisms: The process involves C-H bond activation, likely formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent H-abstraction. However, the understanding of elementary processes in alkene formation and combustion is limited.

Process efficiency: Efficiency is influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions. Large vanadia domains are required for ODH, but they also promote propene combustion. Smaller domains preferentially catalyze propane combustion.

Site isolation: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, site isolation likely plays a role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, unwanted side reactions like combustion might be minimized.

The collective influence of these factors on process efficiency is complex. The catalyst's domain size affects different reaction pathways differently, suggesting that careful tuning of catalyst structure is crucial for optimizing ODH processes. However, the lack of detailed understanding of structure-activity relationships remains a significant barrier to further improvements.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes faces significant challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The analysis reveals several key factors influencing process efficiency:

1. Catalyst composition and structure: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with vanadia-based catalysts being prominent. The size and distribution of active sites play a crucial role, as larger vanadia domains are required for ODH but also promote unwanted combustion reactions.

2. Support effects: The basicity of the support material influences selectivity, with more basic supports generally leading to better selectivity maintenance at higher conversions.

3. Reaction mechanisms: While not fully understood, the process likely involves C-H bond activation, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent hydrogen abstraction. The exact mechanisms and their relationships to catalyst properties remain unclear.

4. Selectivity-conversion trade-off: A major challenge is the inverse relationship between alkene selectivity and alkane conversion. As conversion increases, selectivity typically decreases due to over-oxidation of the desired alkene products.

5. Site isolation: This concept is implicitly important in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, unwanted secondary reactions like combustion can be minimized. The observation that propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains suggests that site isolation could potentially improve selectivity.

6. Process efficiency: The interplay of these factors significantly impacts overall efficiency. The ability to maintain high selectivity at higher conversions is crucial for industrial viability. However, the complexity of the reaction network and the limitations in understanding elementary processes hinder optimization efforts.

7. Research needs: There is a clear need for more in-depth studies on the relationships between catalyst composition, structure, and performance. Understanding these connections could lead to the design of more efficient catalysts that can overcome the selectivity-conversion trade-off.

In conclusion, while ODH offers a promising route for alkane valorization, significant challenges remain in catalyst design and process optimization. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, combining advanced characterization techniques, mechanistic studies, and innovative catalyst synthesis strategies.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

Catalyst types: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. Metal oxide-supported vanadia catalysts have shown promise in understanding structure-performance relationships.

Selectivity challenges: A key issue is the decrease in alkene selectivity as alkane conversion increases. This decline is less pronounced with increasing basicity of the support for supported metal oxides.

Catalyst structure: ODH requires large vanadia domains. However, these large domains also promote propene combustion, while smaller domains favor propane combustion. This highlights the delicate balance needed in catalyst design.

Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly detailed for ODH, the document mentions C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction as potential mechanisms in hydrocarbon functionalization. However, these mechanisms are noted as unsuitable for catalytic oxidative functionalization of hydrocarbons like methane to methanol.

Process efficiency: The efficiency is heavily influenced by the interplay between catalyst structure, selectivity, and conversion rates. The challenge lies in maintaining high selectivity while increasing conversion.

Site isolation: Although not directly mentioned for ODH, the concept of site isolation could potentially address selectivity issues by controlling the size and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface.

In summary, achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a significant challenge in ODH. The process efficiency is a result of careful catalyst design, considering factors such as domain size, support basicity, and reaction mechanisms. Further research into optimizing these parameters and potentially exploring site isolation techniques could lead to improvements in ODH performance.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. The interplay between different catalyst types, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, significantly impacts the efficiency and selectivity of the ODH process.

One of the main challenges in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. As alkane conversion increases, olefin selectivity tends to decrease. However, this decline in selectivity can be mitigated by increasing the basicity of the support for supported metal oxide catalysts. This observation highlights the importance of catalyst support properties in influencing reaction outcomes.

The reaction mechanisms involved in ODH are not fully understood, but they likely involve C-H bond activation, formation of M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction steps. The limited understanding of these elementary processes and their relationship to catalyst composition and structure presents a significant barrier to optimizing ODH catalysts.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues in ODH. By controlling the distribution and isolation of active sites on the catalyst surface, it is possible to influence the reaction pathways and improve selectivity. For example, in the case of vanadium phosphate catalysts used for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, increasing the phosphorus to vanadium ratio leads to higher selectivity. This effect is attributed to the stabilization of vanadium in the 4+ oxidation state, which is believed to be the active form for selective oxidation.

The process efficiency of ODH is a result of the complex interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions. Factors such as the nature of the active metal, support properties, and the presence of promoters or modifiers all contribute to the overall performance. By carefully tuning these parameters, researchers aim to develop catalysts that can achieve high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, making ODH a more viable process for industrial applications.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and improving ODH catalysts, there is still much to learn about the fundamental mechanisms and structure-activity relationships. Future research should focus on developing a more comprehensive understanding of these aspects to design more efficient and selective catalysts for the ODH of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。不同类型催化剂(包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统)之间的相互作用对ODH过程的效率和选择性产生显著影响。

ODH的主要挑战之一是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。随着烷烃转化率的增加，烯烃选择性往往会降低。然而，通过增加负载型金属氧化物催化剂支撑体的碱性，可以减缓这种选择性下降。这一观察结果突出了催化剂支撑体性质在影响反应结果方面的重要性。

ODH涉及的反应机理尚未完全理解，但可能包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体的形成和2H-抽提步骤。对这些基本过程及其与催化剂组成和结构关系的有限理解，是优化ODH催化剂的一个重大障碍。

位点隔离在解决ODH选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过控制催化剂表面活性位点的分布和隔离，可以影响反应路径并提高选择性。例如，在用于丁烷氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的钒磷催化剂中，增加磷与钒的比例可以提高选择性。这种效果被归因于钒在4+氧化态的稳定化，据信这是选择性氧化的活性形式。

ODH的过程效率是催化剂组成、结构和反应条件复杂相互作用的结果。活性金属的性质、支撑体特性以及助剂或改性剂的存在等因素都会影响整体性能。通过仔细调整这些参数，研究人员旨在开发能够同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂，使ODH成为更可行的工业应用过程。

总之，虽然在理解和改进ODH催化剂方面取得了重大进展，但对基本机理和结构-活性关系的认识仍有待深入。未来的研究应该集中在发展对这些方面更全面的理解上，以设计出更高效、更具选择性的烷烃ODH催化剂。
