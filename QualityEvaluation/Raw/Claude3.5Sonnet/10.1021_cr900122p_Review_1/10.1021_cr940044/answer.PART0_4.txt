[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are extensively studied for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is especially of great industrial importance because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

[2] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are industrially important in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Recently, the group of Indovina has studied the activity of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane. They have shown that mononuclear Cr3+ species are the active centers, whereas surface oxygens adjacent to this Cr3+ ion are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site."

[4] "The same type of catalysts can be used for hydrogenation reactions, but due to thermodynamical reasons, these reactions require low temperature and relatively high pressures."

[5] "Burwell proposed a model for the mechanism of the reaction. The site was supposed to consist of a Cr3+ cation and an oxygen anion, the Cr3+ cation being accessible from the gas phase because it was situated next to a surface anion vacancy. Hydrogen was assumed to become adsorbed by heterolytical fission with the hydride ion becoming connected to the cation in the surface anion vacancy and the proton being bonded by oxygen."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important industrial process for producing alkenes from saturated hydrocarbons. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play crucial roles in this reaction.

Supported chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/ZrO2, are extensively studied and industrially important for dehydrogenation reactions. The activity of these catalysts is attributed to mononuclear Cr3+ species as active centers, with adjacent surface oxygens likely involved in the dehydrogenation site.

Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are significant in ODH reactions. The process efficiency is influenced by multiple factors, including the nature of the catalyst, reaction conditions, and the proposed reaction mechanisms.

Proposed reaction mechanisms include C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction. Burwell's model suggests that the active site consists of a Cr3+ cation and an oxygen anion, with the Cr3+ cation accessible from the gas phase due to its proximity to a surface anion vacancy. The mechanism involves hydrogen adsorption through heterolytic fission, with the hydride ion connecting to the cation in the surface anion vacancy and the proton bonding to oxygen.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, it's possible to control the reaction pathway and minimize unwanted side reactions, potentially improving selectivity towards the desired products.

The interplay between catalysts, reaction conditions, and mechanisms collectively influences the process efficiency. Optimizing these factors is key to developing more effective ODH processes with improved selectivity and conversion rates.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个重要的工业过程，用于从饱和烃类生产烯烃。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载系统，在这个反应中起着关键作用。

负载型铬氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr/Al2O3和Cr/ZrO2，被广泛研究并在工业上用于脱氢反应。这些催化剂的活性归因于单核Cr3+物种作为活性中心，相邻的表面氧可能参与脱氢位点。

在ODH反应中，实现高选择性和高转化率是一个重大挑战。过程效率受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂的性质、反应条件和提出的反应机理。

提出的反应机理包括C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体和2H-抽提。Burwell的模型表明，活性位点由Cr3+阳离子和氧阴离子组成，由于Cr3+阳离子靠近表面阴离子空位，因此可以从气相接触。该机理涉及通过异裂作用吸附氢，氢负离子与表面阴离子空位中的阳离子连接，质子与氧结合。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，可以控制反应路径并最小化不需要的副反应，从而可能提高对目标产品的选择性。

催化剂、反应条件和机理之间的相互作用共同影响过程效率。优化这些因素是开发更有效的ODH过程，提高选择性和转化率的关键。
