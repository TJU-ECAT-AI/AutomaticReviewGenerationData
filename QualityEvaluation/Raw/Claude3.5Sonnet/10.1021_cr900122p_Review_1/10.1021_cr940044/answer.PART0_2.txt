[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are extensively studied for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is especially of great industrial importance because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

[2] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are industrially important in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Recently, the group of Indovina has studied the activity of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane. They have shown that mononuclear Cr3+ species are the active centers, whereas surface oxygens adjacent to this Cr3+ ion are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site."

[4] "Upon reduction, this Cr3+ is oxidized to mainly monochromate/polychromate and some Cr5+, while reduction results in the formation of (pseudo-) octahedral Cr3+, (pseudo-) octahedral Cr2+ and (pseudo-) tetrahedral Cr2+."

[5] "Thus, an average oxidation number of 2 and 3 was obtained after reduction for silica and alumina surfaces, respectively. Silica aluminas have an intermediate behavior. These differences in redox behavior can be explained in terms of hardness and softness, first introduced by Pearson."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important industrial process for producing alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in this reaction.

Chromium-based catalysts, particularly Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/ZrO2, have been extensively studied for dehydrogenation reactions. The active sites for these reactions are typically mononuclear Cr3+ species, with adjacent surface oxygen atoms involved in the dehydrogenation process.

One of the main challenges in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The interplay between the catalyst composition and the support material significantly influences the process efficiency. For instance, the redox behavior of chromium species varies depending on the support: silica surfaces tend to reduce chromium to an average oxidation state of 2, while alumina surfaces maintain an average oxidation state of 3. This difference can be attributed to the hardness and softness of the support materials.

The reaction mechanism for ODH likely involves C-H bond activation, potentially followed by the formation of M-alkyl intermediates or 2H-abstraction. The specific pathway depends on the catalyst and reaction conditions.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, catalysts can potentially minimize unwanted side reactions and improve selectivity towards the desired alkene products. This concept is particularly important when designing supported catalysts, where the distribution and accessibility of active sites can be controlled through synthesis methods and support selection.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by factors such as the nature of the active sites, the support material, the oxidation state of the metal centers, and the reaction conditions. Balancing these factors is key to developing catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and high conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个重要的工业过程，用于从低成本的饱和烃类生产烯烃。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，在这个反应中起着至关重要的作用。

铬基催化剂，特别是Cr/Al2O3和Cr/ZrO2，已被广泛研究用于脱氢反应。这些反应的活性位点通常是单核Cr3+物种，相邻的表面氧原子参与脱氢过程。

ODH的主要挑战之一是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。催化剂组成和载体材料之间的相互作用显著影响过程效率。例如，铬物种的氧化还原行为因载体而异：二氧化硅表面倾向于将铬还原至平均氧化态2，而氧化铝表面保持平均氧化态3。这种差异可归因于载体材料的硬度和软度。

ODH的反应机理可能涉及C-H键活化，随后可能形成M-烷基中间体或进行2H-抽提。具体途径取决于催化剂和反应条件。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，催化剂可能最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，提高对所需烯烃产物的选择性。这个概念在设计负载型催化剂时特别重要，其中活性位点的分布和可及性可以通过合成方法和载体选择来控制。

ODH过程的效率受到诸多因素的共同影响，如活性位点的性质、载体材料、金属中心的氧化态以及反应条件。平衡这些因素是开发能够在烷烃氧化脱氢中实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂的关键。
