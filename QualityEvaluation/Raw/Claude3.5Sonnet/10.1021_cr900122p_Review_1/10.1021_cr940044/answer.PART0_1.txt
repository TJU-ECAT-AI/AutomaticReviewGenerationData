[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are extensively studied for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is especially of great industrial importance because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

[2] "The catalytic performances of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation was discovered by Frey and Huppke in 1933 165-166 and is generally known as the Houdry catalyst. 167 This catalyst catalyzes the conversion of e.g. propane to propene, butane to butadiene, and ethylbenzene to styrene at relatively high temperature (450700 C) and low pressure (15 bar)."

[3] "Because of the different side reactions (cracking and coking), due to the alumina support, the catalyst is easily deactivated and, consequently, regeneration is required."

[4] "Recently, the group of Indovina has studied the activity of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.15 They have shown that mononuclear Cr3+ species are the active centers, whereas surface oxygens adjacent to this Cr3+ ion are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is an important industrial process for converting saturated hydrocarbons into more valuable alkenes. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in this reaction.

Chromium-based catalysts, particularly Cr/Al2O3 (Houdry catalyst) and Cr/ZrO2, have been extensively studied for alkane dehydrogenation. These catalysts operate at high temperatures (450-700°C) and low pressures (1-5 bar) to convert alkanes like propane to propene, butane to butadiene, and ethylbenzene to styrene.

The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include:

1. Side reactions: Cracking and coking occur, especially on alumina supports, leading to catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration.

2. High temperatures: The process requires elevated temperatures, which can promote undesired reactions and affect energy efficiency.

3. Catalyst stability: Deactivation due to coking and other factors necessitates catalyst regeneration, impacting process continuity.

Proposed reaction mechanisms involve:

1. C-H bond activation: The initial step in the dehydrogenation process.
2. M-alkyl intermediates: Formation of metal-alkyl species as reaction intermediates.
3. 2H-abstraction: Removal of hydrogen atoms from the alkane to form the alkene.

Recent studies on Cr/ZrO2 catalysts suggest that mononuclear Cr3+ species act as active centers, with adjacent surface oxygens involved in the dehydrogenation site. This insight into the active sites helps in understanding the reaction mechanism and potentially improving catalyst design.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, such as mononuclear Cr3+ species, the catalyst can promote the desired dehydrogenation reaction while minimizing side reactions. This approach can lead to improved selectivity and overall process efficiency.

To enhance the ODH process efficiency, researchers focus on:

1. Developing catalysts with better stability and resistance to coking.
2. Optimizing support materials to minimize undesired side reactions.
3. Fine-tuning the active sites to improve selectivity towards the desired alkene products.
4. Exploring new catalyst formulations and preparation methods to achieve better performance.

In conclusion, the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic understanding is crucial for improving the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Continued research in this area aims to develop more efficient and selective catalysts, ultimately leading to more sustainable and economical processes for alkene production.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个将饱和烃转化为更有价值的烯烃的重要工业过程。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，在这个反应中起着关键作用。

以铬为基础的催化剂，特别是Cr/Al2O3（Houdry催化剂）和Cr/ZrO2，已被广泛研究用于烷烃脱氢。这些催化剂在高温（450-700°C）和低压（1-5巴）下运行，将烷烃如丙烷转化为丙烯，丁烷转化为丁二烯，以及乙苯转化为苯乙烯。

在实现高选择性和转化率方面的主要挑战包括：

1. 副反应：特别是在氧化铝载体上发生裂解和结焦，导致催化剂失活和需要频繁再生。

2. 高温：该过程需要高温，这可能促进不期望的反应并影响能源效率。

3. 催化剂稳定性：由于结焦和其他因素导致的失活需要催化剂再生，影响过程的连续性。

提出的反应机理包括：

1. C-H键活化：脱氢过程的初始步骤。
2. M-烷基中间体：形成金属-烷基物种作为反应中间体。
3. 2H-抽提：从烷烃中移除氢原子形成烯烃。

最近对Cr/ZrO2催化剂的研究表明，单核Cr3+物种作为活性中心，相邻的表面氧参与脱氢位点。这种对活性位点的洞察有助于理解反应机理并可能改进催化剂设计。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，如单核Cr3+物种，催化剂可以促进所需的脱氢反应，同时最小化副反应。这种方法可以提高选择性和整体过程效率。

为了提高ODH过程效率，研究人员关注：

1. 开发具有更好稳定性和抗结焦性的催化剂。
2. 优化载体材料以最小化不需要的副反应。
3. 精细调整活性位点以提高对所需烯烃产品的选择性。
4. 探索新的催化剂配方和制备方法以获得更好的性能。

总之，催化剂组成、反应条件和机理理解之间的相互作用对于改进烷烃的氧化脱氢至关重要。该领域的持续研究旨在开发更高效和选择性的催化剂，最终导致更可持续和经济的烯烃生产过程。
