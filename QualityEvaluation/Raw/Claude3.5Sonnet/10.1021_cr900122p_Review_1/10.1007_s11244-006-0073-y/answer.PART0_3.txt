[1] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]. All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Brønsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O− or O2−."

[2] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."

[3] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."

[4] "In fact, as already proposed O−, superoxo O2− or peroxo species can be involved in the alkane dehydrogenation and interconversion pathways exist between these species (figure 4) [31]."

[5] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species and that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72] and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov et al. [73]."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses several key aspects:

1. Catalyst types: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used for ODH reactions. The document mentions VPO, Ti(Zr)PO, VSbO, and MoVTeNbO as efficient catalysts for light alkane selective oxidation.

2. Challenges in selectivity and conversion: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH reactions. This is due to the multiple possible reaction pathways and the difficulty in controlling the extent of oxidation.

3. Proposed reaction mechanisms: Several mechanisms are discussed for alkane activation:

   a) C-H bond activation: The primary step often involves the rupture of a methylene C-H bond.
   
   b) Involvement of various oxygen species: O−, superoxo O2−, and peroxo species can participate in alkane dehydrogenation.
   
   c) Role of active sites: Strong Brønsted or Lewis acid sites, coupled with basic oxygens or strong electrophilic species, are involved in alkane activation.

4. Process efficiency: The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the specific mechanisms involved. The ability to control the extent of oxidation and prevent over-oxidation is crucial for achieving high selectivity.

5. Site isolation: This plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated active sites help stabilize intermediate oxygen species between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species. This stabilization can lead to more controlled oxidation, potentially improving selectivity.

The document emphasizes that a complete understanding of the ODH process requires consideration of surface dynamics, adsorbed species, and the collective properties of the catalyst. The interplay between these factors determines the overall efficiency of the process, with site isolation emerging as a key strategy for improving selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂类型：ODH反应中使用了块状金属氧化物和负载型体系。文档提到VPO、Ti(Zr)PO、VSbO和MoVTeNbO是轻烷烃选择性氧化的高效催化剂。

2. 选择性和转化率的挑战：在ODH反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战。这是由于存在多种可能的反应途径以及控制氧化程度的困难。

3. 提出的反应机理：讨论了几种烷烃活化机理：

   a) C-H键活化：主要步骤通常涉及亚甲基C-H键的断裂。
   
   b) 各种氧物种的参与：O−、超氧O2−和过氧物种可以参与烷烃脱氢。
   
   c) 活性位点的作用：强Brønsted或Lewis酸位点，coupled与碱性氧或强亲电物种，参与烷烃的活化。

4. 过程效率：ODH过程的效率受催化剂性质、反应条件和具体机理之间相互作用的影响。控制氧化程度和防止过度氧化的能力对于实现高选择性至关重要。

5. 位点隔离：这在解决选择性问题方面起着重要作用。隔离的活性位点有助于稳定晶格氧和吸附氧物种之间的中间氧物种。这种稳定化可能导致更受控的氧化，潜在地提高选择性。

文档强调，全面理解ODH过程需要考虑表面动力学、吸附物种和催化剂的整体性质。这些因素之间的相互作用决定了整个过程的效率，其中位点隔离成为提高氧化脱氢反应选择性的关键策略。
