[1] "The activation mechanism of light alkanes is discussed in view of the catalytic properties, and both, bulk and surface properties of active phases."

[2] "Different activation processes are proposed depending upon the catalyst used but all have the same H abstracting sites corresponding to O−."

[3] "The formation of these relatively strong bound species may be related to structure defects (cationic vacancies, excess oxygen) or they might be created through thermally activated electron transfer."

[4] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."

[5] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses several key aspects:

1. Catalyst types: Both bulk metal oxides (like VPO and VSbO) and supported systems are mentioned as efficient catalysts for alkane activation.

2. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH reactions.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Several mechanisms are proposed:
   - C-H bond activation, particularly involving the rupture of methylene C-H bonds
   - H abstraction by O− species, which are considered the common H abstracting sites across different catalysts
   - Possible involvement of weakly adsorbed surface oxygen species in activating the first C-H bond

4. Active sites: The formation of active O− species is related to structural defects such as cationic vacancies and excess oxygen, or they may be created through thermally activated electron transfer.

5. Site isolation: This plays a crucial role in stabilizing active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species, which helps address selectivity issues.

6. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst properties, the activation mechanism, and the ability to overcome the activation step.

The literature emphasizes that different activation processes are proposed depending on the catalyst used, but all involve H abstraction by O− sites. The formation and stability of these O− species, along with site isolation, appear to be key factors in addressing selectivity issues and improving overall process efficiency in ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂类型：提到了体相金属氧化物（如VPO和VSbO）和负载型系统作为烷烃活化的有效催化剂。

2. 挑战：在ODH反应中，同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战。

3. 反应机理：提出了几种机理：
   - C-H键活化，特别是涉及亚甲基C-H键的断裂
   - O−物种的H抽提，被认为是不同催化剂中共同的H抽提位点
   - 弱吸附的表面氧物种可能参与激活第一个C-H键

4. 活性位点：活性O−物种的形成与结构缺陷（如阳离子空位和过量氧）有关，或者可能通过热激活的电子转移产生。

5. 位点隔离：这在稳定晶格氧和吸附氧物种之间的活性中间物种方面起着关键作用，有助于解决选择性问题。

6. 过程效率：效率受催化剂性质、活化机理以及克服活化步骤能力的相互作用影响。

文献强调，根据所使用的催化剂，提出了不同的活化过程，但都涉及O−位点的H抽提。O−物种的形成和稳定性，以及位点隔离，似乎是解决ODH反应中选择性问题和提高整体过程效率的关键因素。
