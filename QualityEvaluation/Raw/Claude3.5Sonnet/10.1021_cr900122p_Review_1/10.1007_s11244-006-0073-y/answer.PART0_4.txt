[1] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]. All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Brønsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O- or O2-."

[2] "It appears that such an approach should be restricted to alkane activation sites and a complete modeling of the reaction process would necessitate to encompass the dynamic of the surface and the adsorbed species [3,10] as well as sites constituted of larger clusters of atoms and collective properties of the solid [11,12]."

[3] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."

[4] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species and that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72] and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov et al. [73]."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay of factors:

1. Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. The literature discusses VPO, Ti(Zr)PO, VSbO, and MoVTeNbO catalysts as examples.

2. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult. This is due to the propensity for over-oxidation of the desired products.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Several mechanisms are proposed, including:
   - C-H bond activation, particularly of methylene CH bonds
   - Formation of M-alkyl intermediates 
   - 2H-abstraction processes

4. Active sites: These often involve specific properties such as strong Brønsted or Lewis acidity, basic oxygens, or electrophilic species like O- or O2-.

5. Site isolation: This plays a crucial role in stabilizing active species and improving selectivity. Isolated sites help prevent over-oxidation by limiting the interaction between adsorbed species and multiple active sites.

6. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the catalyst's ability to activate the C-H bond selectively, the stability of intermediates, and the ability to desorb products before further oxidation occurs.

7. Surface dynamics: A complete understanding of the process requires consideration of surface dynamics, adsorbed species interactions, and the collective properties of larger atom clusters on the catalyst surface.

The interplay of these factors determines the overall effectiveness of the ODH process. Catalyst design aims to optimize these aspects to achieve high selectivity and conversion while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多个因素的复杂相互作用：

1. 催化剂：使用了体相金属氧化物和负载型系统。文献讨论了VPO、Ti(Zr)PO、VSbO和MoVTeNbO催化剂作为例子。

2. 挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率是困难的。这是由于所需产物容易过度氧化。

3. 反应机理：提出了几种机理，包括：
   - C-H键活化，特别是亚甲基CH键
   - 形成M-烷基中间体
   - 2H-抽提过程

4. 活性位点：这些通常涉及特定性质，如强布朗斯特或路易斯酸性、碱性氧或亲电性物种如O-或O2-。

5. 位点隔离：这在稳定活性物种和提高选择性方面起着关键作用。隔离的位点通过限制吸附物种与多个活性位点之间的相互作用，有助于防止过度氧化。

6. 过程效率：效率受催化剂选择性活化C-H键的能力、中间体的稳定性以及在进一步氧化发生前脱附产物的能力的影响。

7. 表面动力学：全面理解该过程需要考虑表面动力学、吸附物种相互作用以及催化剂表面上较大原子簇的集体性质。

这些因素的相互作用决定了ODH过程的整体有效性。催化剂设计旨在优化这些方面，以实现高选择性和高转化率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。
