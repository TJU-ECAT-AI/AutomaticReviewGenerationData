          "Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt% active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

"At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

"Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

"Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."

"By far the most studied systems for propane upgrading center around vanadium (3), vanadiumantimony (4), vanadium molybdenum (5), and vanadiumphosphorus based catalysts (6). Vanadium based systems activate propane at fairly low temperatures (down to 400C), and it has been proposed that their effectiveness might stem from the metalloradical character of vanadium (7)."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Key aspects include:

1. Catalyst types: Single, binary, and ternary metal molybdates supported on silica were investigated. NiMoO4/SiO2 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2 showed the best performance.

2. Reaction mechanism: The process is catalytic and first-order in propane disappearance, with the rate-limiting step being the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen. This suggests a C-H bond activation mechanism.

3. Challenges in selectivity and conversion: The study reports varying propane conversion and propylene yields depending on the catalyst composition. The highest yield reported was 16% at 27% conversion for NiMoO4/SiO2.

4. Improving catalyst performance: Addition of redox elements (V, Fe, Ce, Cr) to NiCo molybdates enhanced catalytic activity, with Cr showing the most promise by maintaining high selectivity at increased conversions.

5. Temperature considerations: Metal molybdates and vanadium-based systems exhibit high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperatures (down to 400°C for V-based systems).

The interplay between these factors collectively influences the ODH process efficiency. While site isolation is not explicitly discussed, the use of supported catalysts and investigation of various metal combinations suggest efforts to optimize catalyst structure and composition, potentially addressing selectivity issues.

The research demonstrates ongoing efforts to balance catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic factors to achieve both high selectivity and high conversion, which remains a key challenge in ODH processes.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。关键方面包括：

1. 催化剂类型：研究了负载在二氧化硅上的单一、双金属和三元金属钼酸盐。NiMoO4/SiO2和Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2表现最佳。

2. 反应机理：该过程是催化的，丙烷消失呈一级反应，限速步骤是亚甲基氢的脱除。这表明存在C-H键活化机制。

3. 选择性和转化率的挑战：研究报告显示，丙烷转化率和丙烯产率随催化剂组成的不同而变化。NiMoO4/SiO2的最高产率报告为27%转化率下的16%。

4. 改善催化剂性能：向NiCo钼酸盐中添加氧化还原元素（V、Fe、Ce、Cr）可以增强催化活性，其中Cr表现最为优异，在提高转化率的同时保持了高选择性。

5. 温度考虑：金属钼酸盐和基于钒的系统在相对较低的温度下表现出较高的丙烷活化活性（基于V的系统低至400°C）。

这些因素的相互作用共同影响了ODH过程的效率。虽然没有明确讨论位点隔离，但使用负载型催化剂和研究各种金属组合表明，努力优化催化剂结构和组成，可能解决选择性问题。

研究表明，正在进行平衡催化剂组成、反应条件和机理因素的持续努力，以实现高选择性和高转化率，这仍然是ODH过程中的一个关键挑战。
