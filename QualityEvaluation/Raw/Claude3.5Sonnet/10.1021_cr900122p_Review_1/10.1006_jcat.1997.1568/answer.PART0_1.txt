[1] "Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt% active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

[3] "At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

[4] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

[5] "By far the most studied systems for propane upgrading center around vanadium (3), vanadiumantimony (4), vanadium molybdenum (5), and vanadiumphosphorus based catalysts (6). Vanadium based systems activate propane at fairly low temperatures (down to 400C), and it has been proposed that their effectiveness might stem from the metalloradical character of vanadium (7)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways. The literature discusses several key aspects:

1. Catalyst composition: Both single and binary metal molybdates supported on silica were investigated, with NiMoO4/SiO2 showing the highest propane conversion and propylene yields. Binary and ternary molybdates, particularly those containing Ni and Co, also demonstrated promising results.

2. Reaction mechanism: The process is described as catalytic and first-order in propane disappearance, with the rate-limiting step being the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen. This suggests a C-H bond activation mechanism.

3. Challenges in selectivity and conversion: The study reports varying propane conversion and propylene yields depending on the choice of metal in the molybdate and the catalyst surface area. This highlights the challenge of achieving both high selectivity and high conversion simultaneously.

4. Improving process efficiency: The addition of redox elements (V, Fe, Ce, Cr) to NiCo molybdates enhanced catalytic activity, with Cr showing the most promise by maintaining high selectivity at increased conversions. This approach allows for lower temperature operation, potentially improving overall process efficiency.

5. Alternative catalytic systems: The study compares molybdate-based catalysts to vanadium-based systems, which are known to activate propane at lower temperatures (down to 400°C). The effectiveness of vanadium-based catalysts is attributed to their metalloradical character.

The interplay between these factors collectively influences the ODH process efficiency. While the study does not explicitly discuss site isolation, the use of supported catalysts and the investigation of various metal combinations suggest attempts to control active site distribution and accessibility, which can impact selectivity.

The research demonstrates ongoing efforts to optimize catalyst composition and reaction conditions to address the challenges of achieving high selectivity and conversion in alkane ODH processes. The exploration of different metal combinations and the addition of redox elements represent strategies to fine-tune catalyst performance and potentially overcome limitations in current ODH technologies.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程，包括催化剂组成、反应条件和机理路径。文献讨论了几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂组成：研究了单一和双金属钼酸盐负载在二氧化硅上的催化剂，其中NiMoO4/SiO2显示出最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。含有Ni和Co的双金属和三元钼酸盐也表现出良好的结果。

2. 反应机理：该过程被描述为催化的，丙烷消失呈一级反应，限速步骤是甲基氢的脱除。这表明存在C-H键活化机理。

3. 选择性和转化率的挑战：研究报告显示，丙烷转化率和丙烯产率随钼酸盐中金属的选择和催化剂表面积的不同而变化。这突出了同时实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战。

4. 提高过程效率：向NiCo钼酸盐中添加氧化还原元素（V、Fe、Ce、Cr）可以增强催化活性，其中Cr表现最为优异，在提高转化率的同时保持了高选择性。这种方法允许在较低温度下操作，可能提高整体过程效率。

5. 替代催化系统：该研究将基于钼酸盐的催化剂与基于钒的系统进行了比较，后者已知可在较低温度（低至400°C）下活化丙烷。钒基催化剂的有效性被归因于其金属自由基特性。

这些因素的相互作用共同影响了ODH过程的效率。虽然研究没有明确讨论位点隔离，但使用负载型催化剂和研究各种金属组合表明，试图控制活性位点的分布和可及性，这可能影响选择性。

研究表明，正在进行优化催化剂组成和反应条件的努力，以解决在烷烃ODH过程中实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战。探索不同的金属组合和添加氧化还原元素代表了微调催化剂性能和可能克服当前ODH技术局限性的策略。
