[1] "Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt% active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

[3] "At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

[4] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

[5] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction conditions. The literature discusses metal molybdates supported on silica as catalysts for propane ODH. These catalysts include single, binary, and ternary metal molybdates with different compositions.

The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The study shows that NiMoO4/SiO2 achieves the highest propane conversion and propylene yields, followed closely by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2. The addition of redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of NiCo molybdates, with Cr showing the most promise by maintaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen as the rate-limiting step, as evidenced by the first-order kinetics in propane disappearance. This suggests that C-H bond activation is crucial in the ODH process.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, temperature, and the presence of redox elements. The NiCo molybdate system is presented as an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation, indicating its potential for improved process efficiency.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss site isolation, the use of supported catalysts (on silica) and the investigation of various metal combinations suggest efforts to optimize catalyst performance, which may include addressing selectivity issues through controlled dispersion of active sites.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了以二氧化硅为载体的金属钼酸盐作为丙烷ODH的催化剂。这些催化剂包括具有不同组成的单一、双组分和三组分金属钼酸盐。

ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。研究表明，NiMoO4/SiO2获得了最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，其次是Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2。添加V、Fe、Ce和Cr等氧化还原元素可以增强NiCo钼酸盐的活性，其中Cr表现最为突出，在提高转化率的同时保持了高选择性。

提出的反应机理涉及甲基氢的抽提作为限速步骤，这从丙烷消失的一级动力学中得到证实。这表明C-H键活化在ODH过程中至关重要。

过程效率受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、温度和氧化还原元素的存在。NiCo钼酸盐系统被提出作为轻质烷烃活化的V基催化剂的替代品，表明其具有提高工艺效率的潜力。

虽然文献没有明确讨论位点隔离，但使用载体催化剂（在二氧化硅上）和对各种金属组合的研究表明，为优化催化剂性能所做的努力可能包括通过控制活性位点的分散来解决选择性问题。
