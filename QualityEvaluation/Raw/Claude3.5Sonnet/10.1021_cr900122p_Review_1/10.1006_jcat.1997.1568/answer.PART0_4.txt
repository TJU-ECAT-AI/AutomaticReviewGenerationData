[1] "Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt% active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

[3] "At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

[4] "The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields. The effect is largest for the Nimolybdate system whose optimum lies at stoichiometry."

[5] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction conditions. The literature discusses several key aspects:

1. Catalyst composition: Single, binary, and ternary metal molybdates supported on silica were investigated. The choice of metal in the molybdate structure significantly affects propane conversion and propylene yields.

2. Catalyst performance: NiMoO4/SiO2 showed the highest propane conversion and propylene yields, followed closely by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2. The molybdenum content greatly influences catalytic activity and product yields, with the optimum for Ni-molybdate being at stoichiometry.

3. Reaction mechanism: The reaction is catalytic and first-order in propane disappearance, with the rate-limiting step being the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen. This suggests a C-H bond activation mechanism.

4. Improving selectivity and conversion: Adding redox elements like V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of NiCo-molybdates. Cr addition shows particular promise by maintaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions, potentially allowing for lower operating temperatures.

5. Process efficiency: The study suggests that NiCo molybdate systems could provide an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation. The possibility of combining paraffin activating catalysts with olefin conversion catalysts in a single reactor for direct conversion to more valuable products is also mentioned.

While site isolation is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, the use of supported catalysts (on silica) and the exploration of various metal combinations in the molybdate structure suggest efforts to control active site distribution and potentially address selectivity issues.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are evident from the relatively modest yields reported (16% at 27% conversion for the best-performing catalyst). The study's focus on optimizing catalyst composition, exploring ternary systems, and adding redox elements demonstrates ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges and improve process efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂组成：研究了单一、二元和三元金属钼酸盐负载在二氧化硅上的催化剂。钼酸盐结构中金属的选择显著影响丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂性能：NiMoO4/SiO2显示出最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，其次是Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2。钼含量极大地影响催化活性和产品产率，其中Ni-钼酸盐的最佳性能在化学计量比处。

3. 反应机理：反应是催化性的，丙烷消失速率为一级反应，限速步骤是甲基氢的abstraction。这表明存在C-H键活化机制。

4. 提高选择性和转化率：添加V、Fe、Ce和Cr等氧化还原元素可以增强NiCo-钼酸盐的活性。Cr的添加特别有前景，因为它在提高转化率的同时保持了高选择性，可能允许在更低的操作温度下进行反应。

5. 工艺效率：研究表明，NiCo钼酸盐系统可能为轻质烷烃活化提供一种替代V基催化剂的方案。还提到了将烷烃活化催化剂与烯烃转化催化剂在单一反应器中结合，直接转化为更有价值产品的可能性。

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论位点隔离，但使用负载型催化剂（在二氧化硅上）以及探索钼酸盐结构中各种金属组合的做法表明，研究者们正在努力控制活性位点分布并可能解决选择性问题。

从报告的相对较低的产率（最佳性能催化剂在27%转化率下的16%产率）可以看出，实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战是显而易见的。研究关注优化催化剂组成、探索三元系统和添加氧化还原元素，这表明正在进行持续努力以克服这些挑战并提高工艺效率。
