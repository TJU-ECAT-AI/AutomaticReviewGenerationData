[1] "Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt% active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methy-lene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

[3] "At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conver-sion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

[4] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a pos-sibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

[5] "Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane ac-tivation at relatively low temperature."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses several key aspects:

1. Catalyst types: The study focuses on single and binary metal molybdates supported on silica, as well as some ternary molybdates. These catalysts, particularly NiMoO4/SiO2 and Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2, show promising results for propane oxydehydrogenation.

2. Reaction mechanism: The rate-limiting step is proposed to be the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen, indicating a C-H bond activation mechanism. The reaction is first-order with respect to propane disappearance.

3. Selectivity and conversion: The study reports highest propylene yields of 16% at 27% propane conversion using NiMoO4/SiO2 at 560°C and atmospheric pressure. This highlights the challenge of achieving both high selectivity and high conversion simultaneously.

4. Catalyst modifications: Addition of redox elements (V, Fe, Ce, and Cr) to NiCo molybdates enhances activity, with Cr showing the most promise by maintaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions. This suggests a potential for lower temperature operation, which could improve process efficiency.

5. Temperature considerations: Metal molybdates are noted to exhibit high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperatures, similar to V-based systems. This is advantageous for process efficiency.

The study does not explicitly discuss site isolation, but the use of supported catalysts (on silica) and the investigation of various metal combinations in the molybdates suggest efforts to optimize catalyst structure and composition. This could indirectly address selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and nature of active sites.

Overall, the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic factors significantly influences the efficiency of the ODH process. The challenge lies in balancing these factors to achieve both high selectivity and high conversion, which remains a key focus for improving the viability of ODH for industrial applications.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂类型：研究主要关注负载在二氧化硅上的单一和双金属钼酸盐，以及一些三元钼酸盐。这些催化剂，特别是NiMoO4/SiO2和Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2，在丙烷氧化脱氢方面显示出有前景的结果。

2. 反应机理：提出的限速步骤是亚甲基氢的脱除，表明存在C-H键活化机制。反应对丙烷消失呈一级反应。

3. 选择性和转化率：研究报告在560°C和大气压下，使用NiMoO4/SiO2时，丙烯最高产率为16%，丙烷转化率为27%。这突出了同时实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战。

4. 催化剂改性：向NiCo钼酸盐中添加氧化还原元素（V、Fe、Ce和Cr）可提高活性，其中Cr表现最为promising，在提高转化率的同时保持高选择性。这表明有可能在更低的温度下操作，从而提高过程效率。

5. 温度考虑：金属钼酸盐在相对较低的温度下表现出较高的丙烷活化活性，类似于基于V的系统。这对提高过程效率有利。

该研究没有明确讨论位点隔离，但使用负载催化剂（在二氧化硅上）以及研究钼酸盐中各种金属组合表明努力优化催化剂结构和组成。这可能通过控制活性位点的分布和性质间接解决选择性问题。

总的来说，催化剂组成、反应条件和机理因素之间的相互作用显著影响ODH过程的效率。挑战在于平衡这些因素以实现高选择性和高转化率，这仍然是提高ODH工业应用可行性的关键焦点。
