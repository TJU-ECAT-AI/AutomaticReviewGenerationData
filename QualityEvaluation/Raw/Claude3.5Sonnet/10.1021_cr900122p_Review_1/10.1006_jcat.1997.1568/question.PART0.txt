Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt%
active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where
A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates
having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe,
Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of
propane to propylene. The reaction is catalytic and is first order in
propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methy-
lene hydrogen being the rate limiting step. Propane conversion and
yields of propylene produced vary greatly with the choice of the
A metal of the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst.
At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conver-
sion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2
(16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2.
The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences
the catalytic activity and useful product yields. The effect is largest
for the Nimolybdate system whose optimum lies at stoichiome-
try. The optimum activity of Comolybdate lies at molybdenum
lean compositions. Binary NiComolybdates are less sensitive to
molybdenum level, offering a conveniently stable catalytic system
for further mechanistic and technological optimization studies. Ad-
dition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of
the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by
retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a pos-
sibility for desired lower process temperature operation. Our studies
suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to
V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins. Futuristically,
it holds promise as the paraffin activating component of a two com-
ponent catalyst system for the direct conversion, in a single reactor,
of propane to acrylic acid or acrylonitrile, with the second compo-
nent being composed of one of the well known olefin converting,
multicomponent mixed metal molybdates.

INTRODUCTION
The discovery and successful commercialization of het-
erogeneously catalyzed selective oxidations and ammox-
idations of olefinic feedstocks to useful oxygen or nitro-
gen containing intermediates has had a major impact on

both industrial and fundamental catalysis (1). More re-
cently (2), research aims have shifted from functionalizing
olefins to functionalizing the more abundant and less ex-
pensive paraffinic feedstocks, in an effort to meet future
chemical, fiber, and polymer needs. One of the newer ap-
proaches has been selective oxydehydrogenation of lower
alkanes, a two-electron oxidation, to functionalize paraf-
fins to the corresponding olefins. The olefins produced may
then be used as feedstocks in selective olefin oxidation and
ammoxidation processes. Alternatively, paraffin activating
catalysts may be combined with compatible olefin conver-
sion catalysts to produce the corresponding oxygen or ni-
trogen containing unsaturated products directly.
In the area of paraffin oxydehydrogenation, several
systems have emerged in recent years holding some
promise for further study and development, particularly
when applied to propane, i-butane, and n-butane. By far
the most studied systems for propane upgrading center
around vanadium (3), vanadiumantimony (4), vanadium
molybdenum (5), and vanadiumphosphorus based cata-
lysts (6). Vanadium based systems activate propane at fairly
low temperatures (down to 400C), and it has been pro-
posed that their effectiveness might stem from the met-
alloradical character of vanadium (7). Other alkane ac-
tivating systems reported in the literature include metal
phosphates (8), metal niobates (9), and metal molybdates
(1013).
Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they
exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane ac-
tivation at relatively low temperature. While Hardman (10)
studied primarily CoMoO4 based catalysts for the oxydehy-
drogenation of propane to propylene, and Mazzochia et al.
(11) primarily NiMoO4, we undertook a broader investiga-
tion of propane oxydehydrogenation, studying single and
binary molybdates of the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni,
Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn; some ternary molybdates of the for-
mulaNi0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4,whereX = P,Bi,Fe,Cr,V,and
Ce; and systems of the formula Ni0.5Co0.5Y0.002MoO4, where
Y = K or Cs. A recent study of Moro-oka et al. (13) also ex-
amines propane oxidation with metal molybdate catalysts,
and a review of propane oxydehydrogenation was recently
reported by Cavani and Trifiro (14).

PROPANE OXIDATION OVER METAL MOLYBDATES
551
EXPERIMENTAL
The molybdate catalysts used in this study were prepared
by refluxing aqueous solutions of stoichiometric amounts of
the appropriate metal nitrate salts with ammonium hepta-
molybdate in the presence of silica sol (LUDOX AS-40).
After drying the entire mixture and pulverizing, the resul-
tant material was air calcined for 4 h at 290C and 4 h
at 600C, pelletized, and sized to 20/40 mesh for catalytic
evaluation. All catalysts were silica supported (80% active
phase, 20% SiO2).
The catalysts were characterized by powder diffraction
techniques at room temperature, using relatively slow scan
speeds (step size = 0.02, scanning time = 2 s/step) with data
accumulation from 4 to 702Î¸. X-ray indexing was done by
referencing to an internal standard of LaB6 (NIST SRM
660). BET surface areas were measured with a Micromerit-
ics ASAP 2400 N2 physisorption apparatus.
The catalysts were evaluated in a fixed-bed, quartz mi-
croreactor, operated at ambient pressure. The gaseous feed
to the reactor was prepared by metering propane, oxygen,
and nitrogen with mass flow controllers. The reactor con-
sisted of a wide bore top section (13 mm o.d., 10 mm i.d.,
25 cm long) on top of a narrow bore exit line (6 mm o.d./
2 mm i.d., 23 cm long). The pelletized, to 20/40 mesh sized,
catalyst was mixed with an equal weight of 20/40 mesh acid
washed quartz chips, the mixture then supported on quartz
wool directly above the juncture in the reactor and covered
with a 10-cm-long preheat zone of 20/40 mesh quartz chips
to minimize dead volume. A 6-mm-o.d. quartz thermowell
was centered axially in the reactor, which allowed for mon-
itoring the temperature of the entire active catalyst bed.
The catalyst bed was isothermal (2C), and the furnace
temperature was adjusted for the exothermicity of the re-
action in the catalyst bed. Temperatures reported herein are
catalyst operating temperatures at conditions as specified.
The composition of the feed and product streams was
determined by gas chromatography. The reactor effluent
flowed directly through a heat traced line to a heated GC
sampling valve to the GC (on-line analysis for oxygenates),
then through an ice-cooled trap and a gas collection bulb
to vent. Oxygenates and C+
5 products were analyzed with
a Varian GC using a 50-m DB-1 capillary column (FID
detector). The gas collection bulb was sampled off-line with
a Carle refinery gas analyzer (RGA) equipped with TCD
and FID detectors. C1, C
2, C=
2 , and fixed gases (O2, N2, CO,
and CO2) were analyzed with the TCD, while saturated and
unsaturated C3 and C4 components were analyzed on the
FID. Water was not measured.
Catalysts were evaluated in two ways. In the first test,
1 g of 20/40 mesh catalyst dispersed in 1 g quartz chips was
loaded in a reactor (see above), the catalyst was calcined
under air (100 cc/min) for 1 h at 700C, and feed (a 60 cc/min
mixture of C
3, O2, and N2 (15 : 15 : 70)) was introduced after
cooling to 560C under N2 flush. The second test was per-
formed in a likewise manner, except that feed was diverted
as necessary to vary contact time (WHSV varied from 0.8
to 4, total gas flow rates of 250 to 30 cc/min), to obtain a
range of hydrocarbon conversions.
Conversion is defined as the mole fraction of feed carbon
or oxygen present in all reaction products. Yield is the mole
fraction of feed carbon present in a product, and selectiv-
ity is yield divided by conversion. The data reported here
were obtained at oxygen conversions of 80% or less. The
background reactivity of both propane and propylene with
oxygen, measured in a reactor filled with quartz chips, is in-
significant (less than 1.5% under the most severe conditions
studied). Carbon and hydrogen closures were typically bet-
ter than 97%, oxygen closures typically better than 95%
(closures were calculated based on reaction stoichiometry,
including the anticipated water formation). The results re-
ported are corrected for any carbon nonclosure.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Catalyst Characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the metal
molybdates AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and Zn,
are shown in Fig. 1. As reported in the literature (1517),
three structural types are possible for these molybdates:
Î±-MnMoO4, Î±-CoMoO4, and NiWO4 (Î±-ZnMoO4). The
