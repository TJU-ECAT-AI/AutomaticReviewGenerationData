[1] "The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

[2] "Propane conversion and yields of propylene produced vary greatly with the choice of the A metal of the molybdate and the surface area of the catalyst."

[3] "At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

[4] "The molybdenum content of the compositions greatly influences the catalytic activity and useful product yields. The effect is largest for the Nimolybdate system whose optimum lies at stoichiometry."

[5] "Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

[6] "Our studies suggest, that the NiCo molybdate system provides an alternate to V-based catalysts for the activation of light paraffins."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses metal molybdate catalysts, specifically AMoO4 where A can be Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, or Zn, as well as binary and ternary molybdates.

The choice of metal in the molybdate significantly affects propane conversion and propylene yields. NiMoO4/SiO2 shows the highest performance, followed closely by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2. The molybdenum content also plays a crucial role in catalytic activity and product yields, with the effect being most pronounced in the Ni-molybdate system.

The reaction mechanism involves the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen as the rate-limiting step, consistent with first-order kinetics in propane disappearance. This suggests that C-H bond activation is a key factor in the ODH process.

Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are addressed through catalyst composition and the addition of redox elements. The addition of V, Fe, Ce, and Cr to NiCo-molybdates enhances activity, with Cr showing particular promise in maintaining high selectivity at increased conversions.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss site isolation, the use of supported catalysts (80% active phase on 20% SiO2) suggests an attempt to improve catalyst performance, possibly by enhancing dispersion of active sites.

The process efficiency is influenced by various factors including catalyst composition, reaction temperature, and the balance between conversion and selectivity. The NiCo molybdate system is proposed as an alternative to V-based catalysts for light paraffin activation, indicating its potential for improved process efficiency.

Overall, the ODH of alkanes involves a delicate balance between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic considerations to achieve optimal performance in terms of both selectivity and conversion.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。文献讨论了金属钼酸盐催化剂，特别是AMoO4，其中A可以是Ni、Co、Mg、Mn或Zn，以及二元和三元钼酸盐。

钼酸盐中金属的选择显著影响丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。NiMoO4/SiO2显示出最高的性能，其次是Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2。钼的含量也在催化活性和产品产率中起着关键作用，这种效果在Ni-钼酸盐系统中最为明显。

反应机理涉及亚甲基氢的脱除作为限速步骤，这与丙烷消失的一级动力学一致。这表明C-H键活化是ODH过程中的一个关键因素。

通过催化剂组成和添加氧化还原元素来解决实现高选择性和转化率的挑战。向NiCo-钼酸盐中添加V、Fe、Ce和Cr可以增强活性，其中Cr在保持高选择性的同时增加转化率方面显示出特别的前景。

虽然文献没有明确讨论位点隔离，但使用负载型催化剂（80%活性相在20% SiO2上）表明试图改善催化剂性能，可能是通过增强活性位点的分散性。

过程效率受到各种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应温度以及转化率和选择性之间的平衡。NiCo钼酸盐系统被提议作为基于V的催化剂的替代品，用于轻质烷烃的活化，表明其在提高过程效率方面的潜力。

总的来说，烷烃的ODH涉及催化剂组成、反应条件和机理考虑之间的微妙平衡，以在选择性和转化率方面实现最佳性能。
