[2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles. These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[3] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."

[4] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."

[5] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."

[6] "The extent of reduction also increased with increasing VOx surface density, consistent with the more reducible nature and higher catalytic reactivity of larger VOx domains and with the kinetic relevance of the CH bond activation step, which requires the formal reduction of V5+ centers."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms. The efficiency of ODH is primarily determined by the interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and electronic properties.

Bulk metal oxides and supported systems exhibit different behaviors in ODH reactions. Supported systems, particularly those with intermediate surface densities of active metal oxides (e.g., MoOx, VOx), show higher catalytic activity. This is due to their ability to form larger domains that can more readily accept electron density and stabilize transition states in rate-determining reduction steps.

The reaction mechanism involves reduction-oxidation cycles, following the Mars-van Krevelen pathway. The rate-limiting step is the reduction phase, which includes the activation of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule. This step occurs on lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a challenge in ODH processes. As the reactivity of the catalyst increases with larger domain sizes and higher surface densities, there is also an increased tendency for over-oxidation, leading to the formation of COx byproducts.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By controlling the size and distribution of active sites, it is possible to minimize unwanted secondary reactions that lead to complete oxidation. However, there is a delicate balance to maintain, as larger domains are generally more active but potentially less selective.

The extent of reduction of the active centers during catalysis is another important factor. Studies have shown that the degree of reduction increases with higher surface densities of active metal oxides, correlating with increased catalytic activity. This supports the redox nature of the catalytic cycle and the importance of the C-H bond activation step in determining overall reaction rates.

In summary, the efficiency of the ODH process is a result of carefully balancing catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions to optimize both activity and selectivity. The challenge lies in designing catalysts that can effectively activate C-H bonds while minimizing over-oxidation, a goal that requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到与催化剂性质和反应机理相关的各种因素的影响。ODH的效率主要由催化剂的组成、结构和电子性质之间的相互作用决定。

体相金属氧化物和负载系统在ODH反应中表现出不同的行为。负载系统，特别是那些具有中等表面密度的活性金属氧化物（如MoOx、VOx），显示出更高的催化活性。这是因为它们能够形成更大的域，更容易接受电子密度并稳定速率决定还原步骤中的过渡态。

反应机理涉及氧化还原循环，遵循Mars-van Krevelen路径。速率限制步骤是还原阶段，包括在烷烃分子中最弱C-H键的活化。这一步骤发生在可还原氧化物域表面的晶格氧原子上。

在ODH过程中同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是一个挑战。随着催化剂反应活性随着域尺寸增大和表面密度增高而增加，过度氧化的趋势也会增加，导致COx副产物的形成。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。通过控制活性位点的大小和分布，可以最大限度地减少导致完全氧化的不需要的二次反应。然而，需要保持微妙的平衡，因为较大的域通常更活跃但可能选择性较低。

催化过程中活性中心的还原程度是另一个重要因素。研究表明，随着活性金属氧化物表面密度的增加，还原程度也会增加，这与催化活性的增加相关。这支持了催化循环的氧化还原性质，以及C-H键活化步骤在决定整体反应速率中的重要性。

总之，ODH过程的效率是通过仔细平衡催化剂组成、结构和反应条件来优化活性和选择性的结果。挑战在于设计能够有效活化C-H键同时最小化过度氧化的催化剂，这一目标需要深入理解催化剂性质和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。
