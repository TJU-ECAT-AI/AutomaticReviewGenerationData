Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional dehydrogenation processes, offering potential energy savings and improved selectivity. This field has seen significant advancements in catalyst development, with researchers exploring various metal oxides, supported noble metals, and novel materials like metal-organic frameworks. Despite these improvements, challenges persist, including the need for high temperatures, catalyst deactivation, and controlling selectivity to minimize unwanted side reactions. Understanding reaction mechanisms has been crucial in addressing these issues, with studies focusing on the role of lattice oxygen, gas-phase oxygen, and the formation of active sites on catalyst surfaces. Process optimization efforts have centered on reactor design, feed composition, and operating conditions to maximize yield and minimize energy consumption. As the demand for olefins continues to grow, ongoing research in ODH of alkanes aims to bridge the gap between laboratory discoveries and industrial implementation, potentially revolutionizing the production of valuable chemical feedstocks.
