          [1] "The main conclusion of our study is that a good mix of acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products."

[2] "VMgO catalysts [134-142] which is reported to give the best performance (typically 60% of propane selectivity at 15% of propane conversion)"

[3] "According to Volta et al. [138,139] vanadium occupies isolated tetrahedral VO4 sites in Mg3V208, VO6 octahedra linked through edges in a-MgV206 and V207 units consisting of pairs of corner-sharing VO4 tetrahedra in c-MgV207. The obtained order of reactivity and selectivity for the phases were: c-MgzV207 > MgV206 > Mg3V208."

[4] "Concerning the reaction mechanism, a general agreement in literature is that the rate determining step of the reaction is the breaking of the first C-H bond, leading to a propyl species [32,156,157]. Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step."

[5] "Isolated sites are believed to give high selectivities [35]."

[6] "The short V=O bond is proposed to initiate the H abstraction step whereas the V-O-V bridge participates in the subsequent steps where water is formed."

[7] "The basic idea of these formulations is that associating known solid phases active for the oxydehydrogenation reaction (ODHR) of propane and known solid phases active for the selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein, modified or not, catalyses the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein"

[8] "Activation of the reactant needs operating conditions (temperature as high as 500C for example) which are detrimental to the stability of the product."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

1. Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. VMgO catalysts show promising performance, with 60% propane selectivity at 15% conversion. The structure and composition of catalysts significantly impact their activity and selectivity. For example, in VMgO catalysts, the c-MgV207 phase shows the highest reactivity and selectivity compared to other phases.

2. Catalyst properties: A balance between acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface is crucial for controlling selectivity. The interplay between these properties allows for controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The rate-determining step is generally considered to be C-H bond activation, forming propyl species. The short V=O bond is proposed to initiate the H abstraction step, while the V-O-V bridge participates in subsequent steps where water is formed.

4. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult. The high temperatures required for alkane activation (around 500°C) can lead to product instability and over-oxidation.

5. Site isolation: This plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated sites, such as isolated tetrahedral VO4 units in VMgO catalysts, are believed to promote higher selectivities by limiting over-oxidation pathways.

6. Catalyst design: Associating known solid phases active for ODH of propane with phases active for selective oxidation of propylene is a strategy to catalyze the direct oxidation of propane to more valuable products like acrolein.

The overall efficiency of ODH processes relies on optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions to promote selective C-H bond activation and limit undesired oxidation pathways. Understanding the role of different catalyst structures and their properties in each reaction step is crucial for improving process performance.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

1. 催化剂：使用了体相金属氧化物和负载型系统。VMgO催化剂表现出良好的性能，在15%的转化率下实现60%的丙烷选择性。催化剂的结构和组成显著影响其活性和选择性。例如，在VMgO催化剂中，c-MgV207相比其他相显示出最高的反应活性和选择性。

2. 催化剂性质：氧化物表面的酸碱性和氧化还原性之间的平衡对控制选择性至关重要。这些性质之间的相互作用允许反应受控地朝向选择性产物进行。

3. 反应机理：通常认为决速步骤是C-H键活化，形成丙基物种。短V=O键被认为启动H抽提步骤，而V-O-V桥参与后续形成水的步骤。

4. 挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率是困难的。烷烃活化所需的高温（约500°C）可能导致产物不稳定和过度氧化。

5. 位点隔离：这在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。孤立位点，如VMgO催化剂中的四面体VO4单元，被认为可以通过限制过度氧化途径来促进更高的选择性。

6. 催化剂设计：将已知的活性用于丙烷ODH的固相与活性用于丙烯选择性氧化的相结合，是催化丙烷直接氧化成更有价值产品（如丙烯醛）的策略。

ODH过程的整体效率依赖于优化催化剂设计和反应条件，以促进选择性C-H键活化并限制不需要的氧化途径。理解不同催化剂结构及其性质在每个反应步骤中的作用对于改善过程性能至关重要。
