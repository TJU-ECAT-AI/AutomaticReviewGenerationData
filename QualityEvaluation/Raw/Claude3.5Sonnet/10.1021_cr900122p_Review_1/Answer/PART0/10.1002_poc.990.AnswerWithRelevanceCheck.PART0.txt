          [1] "Models of Cr(III)silica were used to study CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from the II state."

[3] "One crucial question concerns the mechanism of CH activation, for which the focus has been on activation through direct interaction with chromium."

[4] "The two most relevant ones are oxidative and electrophilic addition. Electrophilic addition is also known as -bond metathesis, since metalligand and CH bonds are replaced by metal carbon and ligandhydrogen bonds. Conversely, in oxidative addition of ethane, carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the CH bond is broken."

[5] "Based on the present computations, CH activation by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges. The computed activation energy for this initial step is 160 kJ mol1."

[6] "The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species."

[7] "CH activation by oxidative addition thus seems to be an unlikely route to catalytic dehydrogenation for Cr(III)silica catalysts."

[8] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges, the preferred mode of -hydrogen transfer is via a stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand with release of H2."

[9] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through three oxygen bridges, we have not been able to optimize any ethylhydridochromium(V) structure and CH activation according to oxidative addition seems to be excluded."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study primarily focuses on Cr(III)-silica catalysts, with chromium(III) considered the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation.

The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are:
1. High activation energy: The computed activation energy for the initial CH activation step by oxidative addition is 160 kJ/mol.
2. Complex reaction mechanisms: The study investigates CH activation through oxidative addition and electrophilic addition (σ-bond metathesis).
3. Catalyst surface complexity: The complexity of the catalyst surface makes it difficult to fully understand the active site and reaction mechanism.

Proposed reaction mechanisms include:
1. Oxidative addition: Carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the CH bond breaks.
2. Electrophilic addition (σ-bond metathesis): Metal-ligand and CH bonds are replaced by metal-carbon and ligand-hydrogen bonds.
3. β-hydrogen transfer: This occurs after the formation of an ethylhydridochromium(V) complex.

The process efficiency is influenced by:
1. Activation energies: The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is high, comparable to σ-bond metathesis on unstrained three-bridge species.
2. Catalyst structure: DeRossi-type species (CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges) support CH activation by oxidative addition, while three-bridge sites do not.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues:
1. Two-bridge sites: Support oxidative addition and allow for β-hydrogen transfer via stereochemical rearrangement.
2. Three-bridge sites: Do not form stable ethylhydridochromium(V) intermediates, excluding CH activation by oxidative addition.

In conclusion, while oxidative addition is possible on certain Cr(III)-silica sites, it appears to be an unlikely route for efficient catalytic dehydrogenation due to high activation energies and structural limitations. The study highlights the importance of understanding different reaction mechanisms and catalyst structures to improve the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。该研究主要关注Cr(III)-硅胶催化剂，其中三价铬被认为是脱氢反应中活性最高的氧化态。

实现高选择性和高转化率的主要挑战包括：
1. 高活化能：通过氧化加成进行初始CH活化步骤的计算活化能为160 kJ/mol。
2. 复杂的反应机理：研究调查了通过氧化加成和亲电加成（σ-键复分解）进行CH活化的机理。
3. 催化剂表面的复杂性：催化剂表面的复杂性使得完全理解活性位点和反应机理变得困难。

提出的反应机理包括：
1. 氧化加成：碳和氢直接与金属结合，同时CH键断裂。
2. 亲电加成（σ-键复分解）：金属-配体和CH键被金属-碳和配体-氢键取代。
3. β-氢转移：这发生在乙基氢化铬(V)络合物形成之后。

过程效率受以下因素影响：
1. 活化能：基于氧化加成的脱氢总体活化能较高，与非应变三桥物种上的σ-键复分解相当。
2. 催化剂结构：DeRossi型物种（通过两个氧桥键合到表面的CrOH部分）支持通过氧化加成进行CH活化，而三桥位点则不支持。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用：
1. 双桥位点：支持氧化加成，并通过立体化学重排允许β-氢转移。
2. 三桥位点：不形成稳定的乙基氢化铬(V)中间体，排除了通过氧化加成进行CH活化的可能性。

总之，虽然氧化加成在某些Cr(III)-硅胶位点上是可能的，但由于高活化能和结构限制，它似乎不太可能成为高效催化脱氢的途径。该研究强调了理解不同反应机理和催化剂结构对提高ODH过程整体效率的重要性。
