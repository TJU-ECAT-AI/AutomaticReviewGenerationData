          [1] "As is typically the case for partial oxidation there is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion, whether the reaction is carried out in "normal" catalytic fashion or by the cyclic "redox" modification (eq. (2))."

          [2] "CO2 is produced by two paths: a primary one, directly from CH3· (eq. (5)), and a secondary one, via ethylene. The latter is the main source of CO2 at higher (> 15%) conversions."

          [3] "The relative rates of reaction with the metal oxide for the various hydrocarbons-methane, ethane, ethylene, propene (eqs. (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)-are very similar to those for reactions of gas-phase radicals (CH3O·, HO· ), implying they are determined simply by C-H bond strengths."

          [4] "If radical H- abstraction is the key step in these reactions, as several studies strongly indicate [3,7,9], then (absent some degree of shape-selectivity, which will be difficult to achieve at the high temperatures required) the best catalyst should be essentially non-discriminating between various types of C-H bonds [10]."

          While the provided literature primarily focuses on oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) rather than oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), some general principles can be applied to ODH:

          1. Challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion: There is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion in partial oxidation reactions, which is likely applicable to ODH as well.

          2. Reaction mechanisms: The documents discuss radical processes, particularly H-abstraction, as key steps. These mechanisms are likely relevant in ODH reactions too.

          3. Catalyst selectivity limitations: The literature suggests that the best catalysts may not significantly discriminate between different C-H bonds, as reactivity is primarily determined by C-H bond strengths. This principle could apply to ODH catalysts as well.

          4. Competing reaction pathways: In OCM, CO2 is produced both directly and via secondary reactions of desired products. Similar competing pathways likely exist in ODH.

          5. Catalyst performance: The ability to control relative reactivities of different species by changing the catalyst may be limited, posing challenges for achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously in ODH.

          The documents do not provide specific information on different catalysts for ODH, bulk metal oxides, supported systems, or the role of site isolation. To fully answer the question, additional literature focused on ODH would be required.

          虽然所提供的文献主要集中在甲烷氧化偶联（OCM）而不是烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH），但一些一般原则可以应用于ODH：

          1. 实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战：在部分氧化反应中，选择性和转化率之间存在很强的反比关系，这可能也适用于ODH。

          2. 反应机理：文档讨论了自由基过程，特别是H-抽提，作为关键步骤。这些机理在ODH反应中也可能相关。

          3. 催化剂选择性限制：文献表明，最佳催化剂可能不会显著区分不同的C-H键，因为反应活性主要由C-H键强度决定。这一原则也可能适用于ODH催化剂。

          4. 竞争反应途径：在OCM中，CO2既直接产生，也通过所需产物的二次反应产生。ODH中可能存在类似的竞争路径。

          5. 催化剂性能：通过改变催化剂来控制不同物种相对反应活性的能力可能受到限制，这给ODH同时实现高选择性和高转化率带来挑战。

          文档没有提供关于ODH不同催化剂、块状金属氧化物、负载系统或位点隔离作用的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的专注于ODH的文献。
