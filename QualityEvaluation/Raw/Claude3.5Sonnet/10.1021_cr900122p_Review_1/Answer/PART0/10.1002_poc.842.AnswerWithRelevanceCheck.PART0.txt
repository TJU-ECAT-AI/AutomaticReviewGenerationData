          [1] "Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed, and some 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins are anually produced this way."

[2] "Finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium appear as the most interesting catalysts from an industrial point of view."

[3] "There is some controversy concerning the oxidation state of chromium active for dehydrogenation of alkanes. Both Cr(II) and Cr(III) were proposed as the active state quite early on. The dominating view in the modern literature is that III is the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from II."

[4] "Concerning the dispersion of active chromium, below mono-layer coverage and on both alumina, silica and zirconia, a linear relationship is found between the number of mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after calcination, and catalytic activity after reduction."

[5] "A recurrent idea is that CH activation could involve a CrO pair."

[6] "Burwell et al. and later Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt proposed that dehydrogenation is initiated by physisorption of the alkane on coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) centers. A CH bond is subsequently activated and new OH and Cralkyl bonds are being formed"

[7] "According to this mechanism, the alkene is formed as a result of hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to chromium, whereas regeneration of the catalytic site and formation of H2 concludes the catalytic cycle"

[8] "A mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis, accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."

[9] "Based on the computed energies, an alternative mechanism is formulated in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in reaction (2) (above), rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands."

[10] "The importance of this alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain a reactive hydridochromium site, i.e. to prevent formation of more stable species in which chromium is covalently bonded to three oxygen ligands. This ability is a sensitive function of the local structure about chromium."

[11] "A major challenge in computational studies of any of the Croxide systems is to develop realistic models of the chromium surface sites."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Key points include:

1. Catalysts: Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems are used, with finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium being the most industrially relevant. The oxidation state of chromium is debated, with Cr(III) generally considered the most active, possibly with minor contributions from Cr(II).

2. Active sites: Mononuclear chromium species are believed to be sufficient for the reaction, highlighting the importance of site isolation. The dispersion of chromium on supports like alumina, silica, and zirconia plays a crucial role, with a linear relationship observed between mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after calcination and catalytic activity after reduction.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Several mechanisms have been proposed:
   a) C-H activation involving a Cr-O pair
   b) Physisorption of alkane on Cr(III) centers, followed by C-H bond activation and formation of O-H and Cr-alkyl bonds
   c) A three-step mechanism involving C-H activation via σ-bond metathesis, β-H transfer to chromium with ethene loss, and regeneration of the chromium site with H2 loss
   d) An alternative mechanism where C-H activation occurs at a reactive hydridochromium complex

4. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion remains a significant challenge. Developing realistic models of chromium surface sites is crucial for understanding the reaction mechanism and improving catalyst design.

5. Site isolation: It plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the dispersion and nature of active chromium species on the support surface.

The efficiency of the ODH process is influenced by the nature of the catalyst (including its oxidation state and dispersion), the reaction mechanism (particularly the C-H activation step), and the ability to control selectivity through factors like site isolation. The local structure around chromium appears to be a critical factor in determining which mechanism dominates and how efficiently the catalyst performs.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。主要要点包括：

1. 催化剂：使用均相和多相催化系统，其中细分散的铂和氧化物负载的铬是工业上最相关的。铬的氧化态存在争议，通常认为Cr(III)是最活跃的，可能还有Cr(II)的少量贡献。

2. 活性位点：单核铬物种被认为足以进行反应，突出了位点隔离的重要性。铬在氧化铝、二氧化硅和氧化锆等载体上的分散度起着至关重要的作用，在焙烧后的单核Cr(VI)/Cr(V)物种数量与还原后的催化活性之间观察到线性关系。

3. 反应机理：提出了几种机理：
   a) 涉及Cr-O对的C-H活化
   b) 烷烃在Cr(III)中心上的物理吸附，随后是C-H键活化和O-H及Cr-烷基键的形成
   c) 一个三步机理，包括通过σ键复分解的C-H活化、铬的β-H转移伴随乙烯损失，以及铬位点的再生伴随H2损失
   d) 一种替代机理，其中C-H活化发生在反应性氢化铬络合物上

4. 挑战：实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是一个重大挑战。开发铬表面位点的真实模型对于理解反应机理和改进催化剂设计至关重要。

5. 位点隔离：它通过控制载体表面上活性铬物种的分散和性质，在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。

ODH过程的效率受到催化剂性质（包括其氧化态和分散度）、反应机理（特别是C-H活化步骤）以及通过位点隔离等因素控制选择性的能力的影响。铬周围的局部结构似乎是决定哪种机理占主导地位以及催化剂性能如何的关键因素。
