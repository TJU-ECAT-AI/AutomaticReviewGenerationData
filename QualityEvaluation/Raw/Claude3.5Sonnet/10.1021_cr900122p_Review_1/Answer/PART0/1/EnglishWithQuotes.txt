Low-size polymeric species often exhibit better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions compared to larger species or bulk oxides. Monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- tend to promote total oxidation.\n\n3. Reaction Mechanism: ODH typically follows the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, where the substrate is oxidized by the solid catalyst rather than directly by gaseous oxygen. The process involves several steps:\n   a) C-H bond activation: Often through nucleophilic attack by the catalyst's oxygen on C-H bonds.\n   b) M-alkyl intermediate formation: After C-H bond activation.\n   c) 2H-abstraction: Removal of hydrogen to form the alkene product.\n\n4.
