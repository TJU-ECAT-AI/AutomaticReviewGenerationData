"Vanadium is among the most active transition metals capable to effect alkane oxydehydrogenation, oxygenations, and alkylaromatic oxidations."

"Given the importance of metallosilicates, and more specifically titanosilicates, as catalysts in commercial processes, special attention has been paid to these types of materials."

"Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."

"It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

"For instance, vanadium silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

"Zatorski et al. have carried out selectively the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with O2 and N2O. The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium."

"Certainly the development of new Lewis acid solids active and selective for catalytic oxidations is an urgent need and a challenging scientific target for some substrates especially using environmentally friendly oxidants."

"Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

"The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis. It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

"Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

"It appears then that the adsorption and activation of hydrocarbons in oxidation processes can be regarded as acidbase interactions. In this sense, a too strong adsorption of hydrocarbon on the oxidation acid sites will result in a too long contact time on the surface with the corresponding loss of selectivity."

"Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process."

[1] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[2] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."

[3] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."

[4] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[5] "ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UVvisible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes."

[6] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[7] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:
(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C. Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."

[8] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO), and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)"

[9] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds [94]."

[2] "The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts [13,95,96]."

[3] "The invariance of the TOF for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/TiO2 as a function of surface vanadia coverage also suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction [94]."

[4] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."

[1] "V-Mg-O catalysts are active and relatively selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [1)4] and butane [5]."
          [2] "The selectivity to propylene decreased with increasing propane conversion on all catalysts."
          [3] "If the catalytic reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle between V5+ and V4+as suggested in [2,5], a good redox behavior under reaction conditions might be favorable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
          [4] "The exact mechanism by which catalyst reducibility facilitates only the dehydrogenation reaction remains unknown, and further studies of this point are needed."
          [5] "The ease of their reduction decreased as follows: VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK. The activity of catalysts decreased in the order VMg > VMgK > VMgNb > VMgCr > VMgSm, and the dehydrogenation selectivity was like VMg > VMgNb VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK."
          [6] "Note that there is no correlation between the activity and reducibility, while the selectivity to propylene follows the order reducibility, i.e., the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective."

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."

"ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity;"

"In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."

"It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6). An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts"

"The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

"Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the CH bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites: terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated vs polynuclear species"

"The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

"Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."

[1] "Alkanes are attractive alternative feedstocks for chemical synthesis. Compared to their aromatic counterparts, alkanes are both relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly. Unfortunately, few catalysts selectively oxidize alkanes."

[2] "Some of the few successful examples in the literature include: dehydrogenation of alkanes on V-Mg oxide [1], oxidation of propane to acrolein on Bi-Ag-V-Mo oxide [2], and oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride on V-P oxide [3]. Of these examples, only V-P-O is used to functionalize an alkane commercially."

[3] "Research into supported materials has been driven by two factors: supports (1) improve mechanical strength and thermal stability of the catalyst, and (2) increase dispersion of the active phase and, therefore, exposure of active sites."

[4] "Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."

[5] "The highest selectivities reported for the unsupported samples were only about 50%, much lower than  70% for the unsupported ones."

[6] "Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly."

[7] "At low conversions, PV0.0 produced primarily a mixture of 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene but very little maleic anhydride [12]. At higher conversions, carbon oxides dominated."

[8] "In comparison, all phosphorus-modified catalysts had higher selectivities for maleic anhydride."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O)."

[2] "The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."

[3] "Burch and Swarnaka found that a molybdenumvanadiumniobium oxide (Mo:V:Nb = 6:3:1) is highly selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene. The presence of all three oxides is necessary in order to have an active and selective catalyst."

[4] "Their studies suggest that the active phase is based on molybdenum and vanadium. Niobium enhances the intrinsic activity of this combination and improves the reaction selectivity by inhibiting the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[5] "Smits et al. found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low"

[6] "The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."

[7] "Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."

[8] "The reaction's propene selectivity strongly depends on the nature of the catalysts used because propene's re-adsorption and interaction with the acidic sites leads to total oxidation."

"Propane is primarily converted to propene, but reasonably a route of direct conversion to carbon oxides also exist."

"The main route of propane conversion is through the formation of propene as the intermediate, although a side reaction of acrylate formation via propionate intermediate is possible."

"Vanadium ions play two main catalytic roles in the mechanism of synthesis of acrylonitrile on V-Sb-oxide: (i) they constitute the active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and (ii) catalyze the reoxidation of surface Sb-sites reduced in the propene to acrylonitrile conversion."

"The active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."

"Although specific data are not available, it is probable that non-stoichiometric properties of vanadium antimonate influence coordination and valence of surface vanadium ions and thus their activity."

[1] "Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen in a conventional flow reactor. Ethane and ethylene (C, compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion of CHI over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 OC."

[2] "EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li'O-] centers probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH4."

[3] "Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO2, are produced via CH3.; the coupling of two CH3. leads to C2H6, which is partly oxidized to C2H4."

[4] "The Li-promoted MgO contains no transition metals; thus it is a new type of oxidation catalyst on which thermally generated 0- ions activate methane."

[5] "Below 700 "C CO and CO2 are produced by reactions of CH3. with either surface O2- ions or gaseous O2. The latter reaction leads to chain reactions in which additional methyl radicals are generated."

[6] "One cannot exclude the additional formation of methyl radicals through branching gas-phase chain reactions."

"Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts. A peculiar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst."

"Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties. At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide."

"Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."

"Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions. This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice."

"According to this mechanism the substrate is oxidized by the solid and not directly by molecular oxygen of the gaseous phase. The rôle of dioxygen is to regenerate or maintain the oxidized state of the catalyst."

"The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one electron to the metal."

"Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will intervene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring."

"It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reaction since several steps as replenishing of oxygen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned."

[1] "The main conclusion of our study is that a good mix of acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products."

[2] "VMgO catalysts [134-142] which is reported to give the best performance (typically 60% of propane selectivity at 15% of propane conversion)"

[3] "According to Volta et al. [138,139] vanadium occupies isolated tetrahedral VO4 sites in Mg3V208, VO6 octahedra linked through edges in a-MgV206 and V207 units consisting of pairs of corner-sharing VO4 tetrahedra in c-MgV207. The obtained order of reactivity and selectivity for the phases were: c-MgzV207 > MgV206 > Mg3V208."

[4] "Concerning the reaction mechanism, a general agreement in literature is that the rate determining step of the reaction is the breaking of the first C-H bond, leading to a propyl species [32,156,157]. Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step."

[5] "Isolated sites are believed to give high selectivities [35]."

[6] "The short V=O bond is proposed to initiate the H abstraction step whereas the V-O-V bridge participates in the subsequent steps where water is formed."

[7] "The basic idea of these formulations is that associating known solid phases active for the oxydehydrogenation reaction (ODHR) of propane and known solid phases active for the selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein, modified or not, catalyses the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein"

[8] "Activation of the reactant needs operating conditions (temperature as high as 500C for example) which are detrimental to the stability of the product."

[1] "Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions."

          [2] "Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature."

          [3] "The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support."

          [4] "For Mo surface densities below the polymolybdate monolayer values (5 Mo/nm2), no crystalline MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 were detected by these methods after thermal treatment at 393973 K."

          [5] "The size of these two-dimensional polymolybdate domains increased with increasing Mo surface density; this process led to a shift in the ν(MoO) Raman band, to changes in the near-edge X-ray absorption spectra, and to a decrease in the UVvisible edge energy with increasing surface density."

          [6] "Domain growth occurred via oligomerization of isolated tetrahedral MoOx as thermal treatments decreased the ZrO2 surface area available to disperse the MoOx species."

[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts prepared with different atomic ratios Cu/Th have been tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. These catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and selectivity change with the nature of the alkane."

[2] "Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products."

[3] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene."

[4] "As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of CuO may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."

[6] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]. Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A1 and A2 signals, respectively, (Fig. la) at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu2+ ions, characterized by M1, M2 and D signals (Fig. la), occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H2 and/or O2 treatment at different temperatures."

[7] "Therefore, the nature and the copper site concentrations have an important role to explain this difference in both reactions. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated [4-63 that the Cu2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and CuO crystallites for Cu/Th > 0.25 ratios."

[8] "Supposing that the reaction is first order, the selectivity S in propene is given by the following equation: S = (K-1)/K (1-C)[(1-C)K-1] / (E-1) C where K=k1/k2 is the coefficient of selectivity, k1 and k2 are the rate constants of dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation of propene, respectively, and C the conversion of propane."

[1] "Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons, related to the absence of both lone pairs and empty orbitals in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction temperatures around 500-550°C; these temperatures are about 100-150°C higher than those required for propylene ammoxidation."

[2] "A very selective activation of propane to propylene occurs (selectivities higher than 80%), whereas direct ACN synthesis from propane is of secondary importance. ACN forms mainly from the intermediate propylene, but the contemporaneous presence of propylene and ACN is observed over the entire range of propane conversion."

[3] "Kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene."

[4] "V-Al-antimonate based mixed oxides are promising catalytic systems for the selective formation of ACN from propane in the absence of gas-phase additives"

[5] "Ga-antimonates (pure or modified with W, Ni and P) have been studied mainly by Osipova and Sokolovski [5] and show several structural and reactivity analogies to the V-antimonate based system."

[6] "Bi-V-molybdate based catalysts have been studied by Moro-oka et al. [6] and similar compositions have been patented by BP/Sohio [3]. These catalysts are selective to acrylonitrile mainly using high propane and ammonia concentrations and results suggest that they catalyze the step from propylene to acrylonitrile, whereas the first step from propane to propylene occurs in the homogeneous gas phase."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes. While nonoxidative dehydrogenation is endothermic and leads to the concurrent formation of carbon, which, in turn, deactivates the catalysts, ODH is exothermic by forming water as a byproduct and eliminating the coke formation, leading to stable catalysts."

[2] "Several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, and vanadium-based materials are among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are the other promising catalysts for ODH. Although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability."

[3] "It was concluded that ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts follow the same mechanism and that two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of the CH bonds in propane via a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism."

[4] "We predict that hydrogen abstraction by MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. We find that activating the methylene CH bond is 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond."

[5] "Our calculations suggest that a combined effect from both the methylene and the methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall kinetic isotopic effects from propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts."

"The oxidative coupling of methane has provided insight into an unusual type of oxidation catalysis, which involves both surface and gas-phase free-radical chemistry."

"The more effective catalysts may be divided into five groups: a) highly basic pure oxides, of which the early members of the lanthanide oxide series (excluding CeO,) are the best; b) Group IA or IIA ions supported on basic oxides (for example, Li/MgO, Ba/MgO and Sr/La,O,); c) monophasic oxides; d) a few transition metal oxides that contain Group IA ions; and e) any of these materials that are promoted with chloride ions."

"Apparently, the Na,O/Na,CO, layer inhibits electron transfer from CH; to the CeO,, and thus prevents CH; radicals from reacting with the surface."

"Oxidative coupling reactions generally take place at 650-880°C, at the limits of catalytic combustion where the availability of oxygen largely dictates the C2+ selectivity."

"The less basic set of sites is capable of catalyzing only the homolytic C-H bond cleavage in methane, directly producing CH3· radicals that result in C2H6 formation."

"Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions a C,H, selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C,H, conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%."

"The yield of C,H, and C,H, is limited by secondary reactions of CH; radicals with the surface and by the further oxidation of C,H,, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase."

[1] "Lower alkanes (C1C4) are the main components in natural gas, coal bed gas, oil field associated gas, etc. Developing efficient strategies for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes to value-added chemicals or liquid fuels would provide a promising alternative for easing up the oil-demanding situation."

[2] "In most cases, the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxides occurs through the so-called Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, 4-5 in which the organic molecule reacts with the lattice oxygen, and then the oxygen vacancy is replenished by gaseous oxygen."

[3] "The roles that a good catalyst play involve (i) the effective activation of the first CH bond, (ii) the directional transformation of the resulting intermediates into the partial oxidation product, and (iii) a fast reoxidation of the reduced surface."

[4] "When the MO bond is too weak, such as a CrO, regeneration of the lattice oxygen can be a big issue in order to complete the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. If the MO bond is too strong, such as WO, the penalty to open the MO π bond is too high, such that abstracting an H atom from alkanes can be hard to accomplish."

[5] "The common feature of these reactions is that all of them use the high-valence transition metal oxides, such as vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, as catalysts."

[6] "We have carried out a theoretical study on the structurefunction relationship for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes (C1C4). The H abstraction mechanism has been examined over the model catalysts of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the tetrahedral coordination."

[1] "As is typically the case for partial oxidation there is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion, whether the reaction is carried out in "normal" catalytic fashion or by the cyclic "redox" modification (eq. (2))."

          [2] "CO2 is produced by two paths: a primary one, directly from CH3· (eq. (5)), and a secondary one, via ethylene. The latter is the main source of CO2 at higher (> 15%) conversions."

          [3] "The relative rates of reaction with the metal oxide for the various hydrocarbons-methane, ethane, ethylene, propene (eqs. (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)-are very similar to those for reactions of gas-phase radicals (CH3O·, HO· ), implying they are determined simply by C-H bond strengths."

          [4] "If radical H- abstraction is the key step in these reactions, as several studies strongly indicate [3,7,9], then (absent some degree of shape-selectivity, which will be difficult to achieve at the high temperatures required) the best catalyst should be essentially non-discriminating between various types of C-H bonds [10]."

[1] "Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify the elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts."

[2] "Propene is the primary product and carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts via propane and propene combustion."

[3] "These data indicate that the kinetically relevant steps in propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion involve the dissociation of CH bonds in the respective reactant."

[4] "These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism in which two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of C–H bond in propane."

[5] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers."

[6] "Propane ODH turnover rate are widely different on MoO3 and ZrMo2O8 because of apparent differences in the strength and accessibility of active MoO bonds."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. As illustrated below for the case of propane conversion to propene, the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2"

[2] "While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion."

[3] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[4] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[5] "Although a large body of literature exists on the ODH of alkanes, current understanding of the elementary processes involved in both the formation of alkenes and their subsequent combustion is limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding concerning the relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity."

[6] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[7] "Some progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been reported recently for metal oxide-supported vanadia."

[8] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts. The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."

[9] "Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

[1] "Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed, and some 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins are anually produced this way."

[2] "Finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium appear as the most interesting catalysts from an industrial point of view."

[3] "There is some controversy concerning the oxidation state of chromium active for dehydrogenation of alkanes. Both Cr(II) and Cr(III) were proposed as the active state quite early on. The dominating view in the modern literature is that III is the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from II."

[4] "Concerning the dispersion of active chromium, below mono-layer coverage and on both alumina, silica and zirconia, a linear relationship is found between the number of mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after calcination, and catalytic activity after reduction."

[5] "A recurrent idea is that CH activation could involve a CrO pair."

[6] "Burwell et al. and later Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt proposed that dehydrogenation is initiated by physisorption of the alkane on coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) centers. A CH bond is subsequently activated and new OH and Cralkyl bonds are being formed"

[7] "According to this mechanism, the alkene is formed as a result of hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to chromium, whereas regeneration of the catalytic site and formation of H2 concludes the catalytic cycle"

[8] "A mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis, accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."

[9] "Based on the computed energies, an alternative mechanism is formulated in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in reaction (2) (above), rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands."

[10] "The importance of this alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain a reactive hydridochromium site, i.e. to prevent formation of more stable species in which chromium is covalently bonded to three oxygen ligands. This ability is a sensitive function of the local structure about chromium."

[11] "A major challenge in computational studies of any of the Croxide systems is to develop realistic models of the chromium surface sites."

[1] "Recent reports have demonstrated that N2O is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides."

          [2] "The O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, have been postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction."

          [3] "The stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with O- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium heptamolybdate at pH = 2."

          [4] "Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C."

          [5] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."

"Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates was often carried out over supported transition metal oxides. Among various catalysts employed, V2O5 [1012] and MoO3 [1,1315] were considered to be the most active and selective catalysts, while recent studies showed that Fe [1618] and W [19,20] oxides are also of great promise."

"However, a high temperature is generally required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature, the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into unwanted carbon oxides. Therefore, in spite of great effort, the single-pass yield of oxygenates is still quite low, usually less than 4%, far from fulfilling the industrial requirement [7]."

"We concentrated on the activation of CH bonds by terminal oxygens [ O] and bridge oxygens [O]. We considered eight possible mechanisms."

"H abstraction is a 1e process (Fig. 4), which involves radical formation with the metal center being reduced formally by one unit. Here we considered H abstractions both by terminal oxygens (T6 and T7) and bridge oxygens (T8)."

"Among the eight pathways considered here, the most favorable pathway is anti-H abstraction (T6) by terminal oxygen with the exception of W3O9, where (2 + 2) (T1) appears to be the best pathway."

"We also infer that the interplay between the MO bond polarity and the M O p bond strength may counterbalance the reactivity and the selectivity, hence V and Mo oxides are the most active and selective catalysts experimentally observed [1,1015]."

"A fairly good compliance between H abstraction mechanism and experimental evidences supports that H abstraction is the working mechanism for the activation of alkanes on most high valence transition metal oxides."

"Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt% active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

"At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

"Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

"Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."

"By far the most studied systems for propane upgrading center around vanadium (3), vanadiumantimony (4), vanadium molybdenum (5), and vanadiumphosphorus based catalysts (6). Vanadium based systems activate propane at fairly low temperatures (down to 400C), and it has been proposed that their effectiveness might stem from the metalloradical character of vanadium (7)."

[1] "Models of Cr(III)silica were used to study CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from the II state."

[3] "One crucial question concerns the mechanism of CH activation, for which the focus has been on activation through direct interaction with chromium."

[4] "The two most relevant ones are oxidative and electrophilic addition. Electrophilic addition is also known as -bond metathesis, since metalligand and CH bonds are replaced by metal carbon and ligandhydrogen bonds. Conversely, in oxidative addition of ethane, carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the CH bond is broken."

[5] "Based on the present computations, CH activation by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges. The computed activation energy for this initial step is 160 kJ mol1."

[6] "The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species."

[7] "CH activation by oxidative addition thus seems to be an unlikely route to catalytic dehydrogenation for Cr(III)silica catalysts."

[8] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges, the preferred mode of -hydrogen transfer is via a stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand with release of H2."

[9] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through three oxygen bridges, we have not been able to optimize any ethylhydridochromium(V) structure and CH activation according to oxidative addition seems to be excluded."

[1] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures and does not suffer from the detrimental effects of coking"

[2] "However, this selective oxidation is difficult to achieve due to the tendency of propylene to overoxidize to CO and CO2 under the reaction conditions."

[3] "Recent reviews and reports on this subject have suggested that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH"

[4] "The best catalyst performance was observed for materials with 10-18% vanadia content, for which activities were as high as 180 mmol (g cat)−1 h−1, and intrinsic selectivities maximized at about 90%"

[5] "Kinetic analyses of the propane ODH reactions at 606 K showed that the value of k1 (the rate of propane ODH; L mol−1 s−1) was three times greater for the TMP-derived catalysts than for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by wet impregnation"

[6] "However, the k3 values (the rate constants for propylene combustion; L mol−1 s−1) were similar for the two types of catalysts. The latter result is significant, in that dramatic improvements in propane ODH catalysis appear to hinge on development of catalysts with a much lower activity for propylene oxidation (low values of k3)"

[7] "The TMP synthetic route offered the potential to produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities relative to catalysts that were known for propane ODH. It was also hoped that use of this method might provide more controlled transformations to well-defined materials with high surface densities of the desired catalytic sites."

[8] "The improved properties observed for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by the TMP cothermolysis method may be at least partially attributed to higher surface areas and improved dispersions of VOx species relative to those in catalysts prepared by conventional means."

[1] "This review deals with the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative process to direct dehydrogenation, making special reference to the catalytic systems used, kinetic studies performed and reaction mechanisms proposed."

[2] "Particular attention is also focused on the hydrocarbon activation process and on the main factors governing catalytic efficiency."

[5] "NATURE OF ACTIVE AND SELECTIVE SITES"

[6] "KINETICS AND MECHANISM ... Kinetic Studies ... Reaction Mechanism"

[1] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]. All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Brönsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O• or O2•."

[2] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."

[3] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1). In the first one, the n-butane molecule is dehydrogenated with the concerted removal of two hydrogen atoms as H• and H+ on an acidbase VIVO couple (figure 1a) [29]."

[4] "In fact, as already proposed O−, superoxo O2− or peroxo species can be involved in the alkane dehydrogenation and interconversion pathways exist between these species (figure 4) [31]."

[5] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species and that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72] and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov et al. [73]."

[6] "The activation mechanism of light alkanes is discussed in view of the catalytic properties, and both, bulk and surface properties of active phases."

[7] "Different activation processes are proposed depending upon the catalyst used but all have the same H abstracting sites corresponding to O)."

[8] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."

[1] "Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (eq 4)."

[2] "The selectivities and activities for propene formation, extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, were 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C."

[3] "An analogous system with 15 wt % V2O5, prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of ammonium metavanadate onto silica, exhibited a lower selectivity and a similar activity [67% and 0.031 mmol (mol V)-1 s-1, under similar reaction conditions]."

[4] "The V2O5·6SiO2 xerogel is also similar to bulk V2O5 in its ODH of propane (which exhibits a selectivity of about 80%, with a catalyst surface area of 3 m2 g-1) and rapidly declining selectivity with increasing conversions."

[5] "Future work will focus on the production of ternary V/Si/M/O xerogels via a thermolysishydrolysis procedure using 5 and metal alkoxides."

"A new catalytic approach to the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene was presented using Dy-doped (oxy)halides as catalysts. These systems operate as melts, are stable under reaction conditions, have long life times, and most impressively do not produce any chlorinated byproducts, even though operated at rather high temperatures (600 C), that were the culprits in earlier catalytic systems using halogen containing catalysts or halide co-feeds."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."

[2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles. These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[3] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."

[4] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."

[5] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."

[6] "The extent of reduction also increased with increasing VOx surface density, consistent with the more reducible nature and higher catalytic reactivity of larger VOx domains and with the kinetic relevance of the CH bond activation step, which requires the formal reduction of V5+ centers."

[7] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased. The exponential dependence evident from the data in Fig. 13 suggests a relation between the energy required for these electronic transitions and the activation energies for kinetically-relevant steps, the activation of methylene CH bonds in propane reactants using lattice oxygens for this reaction."

[8] "The extent of reduction for all samples (0.0620.30 e/V) was much smaller than required for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V3+ or V4+ and increased with increasing reductant/oxidant ratio, as required by mechanistic considerations based on the prevalent redox cycles and the kinetic relevance of CH bond activation steps."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."

[2] "The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1). Alkenes are primary ODH products while CO and CO2 (COx) can form via either secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes."

[3] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[4] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

[5] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[6] "The apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this same sequence."

[7] "A further decrease in the Lewis acidity of the cations in VOx and MoOx by modifications with oxides or supports of moderate or strong basicity (e.g., MgO, Cs2O), which increase the electron density at cation sites, should lead to less favorable adsorption of alkenes (smaller Δ(ΔHads), and to lower ΔE1  ΔE3 and k3/k1 value."

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor"

          [2] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."

          [3] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."

          [4] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity"

[2] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The acidbase interaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide promotes the approach of the former to the active site"

[3] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation"

[4] "Site isolation proves to improve selectivity"

[5] "The oxidation of ethane involves activation of the organic molecule and of the oxidant. Activation of the oxidant depends on its nature. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide."

[6] "The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Some reports show that the most selective catalysts are less reducible although sometimes this trend is reversed."

[7] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to be involved in the catalytic oxidation of ethane. Furthermore, several experimental evidences support the relevance of bridging oxygens for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[8] "Surface coverage alters the population ratio of (VOV)/(VO-support) bonds. This trend is not observed on silica-supported vanadia, where isolated surface vanadium oxide species are dominant up to monolayer coverage."

[1] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."

[2] "The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction, but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K)."

[3] "The catalytic activity for catalysts based on reducible oxides is usually significantly higher, but selectivities to alkenes is lower in comparison with selectivities of the systems described above."

[4] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[5] "It has been shown (86) that the interaction of an organic molecule with various defects led to the cleavage of the C-H bond, which proceeded by the transfer of two electrons to the empty vanadium surface levels and the formation of adsorbed alkoxy and surface hydroxyl species."

[6] "Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst."

[7] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."

[8] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction. For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57)."

"Supported chromium oxide catalysts are extensively studied for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is especially of great industrial importance because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

"The catalytic performances of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation was discovered by Frey and Huppke in 1933 165-166 and is generally known as the Houdry catalyst. 167 This catalyst catalyzes the conversion of e.g. propane to propene, butane to butadiene, and ethylbenzene to styrene at relatively high temperature (450700 C) and low pressure (15 bar)."

"Because of the different side reactions (cracking and coking), due to the alumina support, the catalyst is easily deactivated and, consequently, regeneration is required."

"Recently, the group of Indovina has studied the activity of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.15 They have shown that mononuclear Cr3+ species are the active centers, whereas surface oxygens adjacent to this Cr3+ ion are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site."

"Upon reduction, this Cr3+ is oxidized to mainly monochromate/polychromate and some Cr5+, while reduction results in the formation of (pseudo-) octahedral Cr3+, (pseudo-) octahedral Cr2+ and (pseudo-) tetrahedral Cr2+."

"Burwell proposed a model for the mechanism of the reaction. The site was supposed to consist of a Cr3+ cation and an oxygen anion, the Cr3+ cation being accessible from the gas phase because it was situated next to a surface anion vacancy. Hydrogen was assumed to become adsorbed by heterolytical fission with the hydride ion becoming connected to the cation in the surface anion vacancy and the proton being bonded by oxygen."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions are also an attractive alternative to classical dehydrogenations. In fact, the dehydrogenation of paraffins to give the corresponding olefins and H2 is a strongly endothermic process which has to be carried out at temperatures above 600C."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins, the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]."

[3] "It appears that tetrahedral V5+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes."

[4] "According to the mechanism proposed for the selective oxidation of n-butane on VPO catalysts, the first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary carbon atom. However, depending on the catalysts, this abstraction can give rise to the formation of three different intermediates (Fig. 9), that after a second H-abstraction can be transformed into olefins, O-containing partial oxidation products or carbon oxides."

[5] "The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support. In addition, and concluding from the most selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins."

[6] "The selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."

[7] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."

[8] "Several factors can contribute to their catalytic behavior, i.e. coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of vanadium species), reducibility of active sites and acid-base character of catalysts and metal oxide support."

[9] "The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species."

[10] "The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these materials. In addition, the appearance of acid and/or basic sites, that strongly depend on the nature of the metal oxide support, determines the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depending on the alkane fed."

"Vanadium is among the most active transition metals capable to effect alkane oxydehydrogenation, oxygenations, and alkylaromatic oxidations."

"Given the importance of metallosilicates, and more specifically titanosilicates, as catalysts in commercial processes, special attention has been paid to these types of materials."

"Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."

"It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

"For instance, vanadium silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

"Zatorski et al. have carried out selectively the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with O2 and N2O. The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium."

"Certainly the development of new Lewis acid solids active and selective for catalytic oxidations is an urgent need and a challenging scientific target for some substrates especially using environmentally friendly oxidants."

"Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

"The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis. It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

"Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

"It appears then that the adsorption and activation of hydrocarbons in oxidation processes can be regarded as acidbase interactions. In this sense, a too strong adsorption of hydrocarbon on the oxidation acid sites will result in a too long contact time on the surface with the corresponding loss of selectivity."

"Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process."

[1] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[2] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."

[3] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."

[4] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[5] "ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UVvisible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes."

[6] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[7] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:
(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C. Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."

[8] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO), and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)"

[9] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds [94]."

[2] "The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts [13,95,96]."

[3] "The invariance of the TOF for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/TiO2 as a function of surface vanadia coverage also suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction [94]."

[4] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives [99]."

[1] "V-Mg-O catalysts are active and relatively selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [1)4] and butane [5]."
          [2] "The selectivity to propylene decreased with increasing propane conversion on all catalysts."
          [3] "If the catalytic reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle between V5+ and V4+as suggested in [2,5], a good redox behavior under reaction conditions might be favorable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
          [4] "The exact mechanism by which catalyst reducibility facilitates only the dehydrogenation reaction remains unknown, and further studies of this point are needed."
          [5] "The ease of their reduction decreased as follows: VMg > VMgNb > VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK. The activity of catalysts decreased in the order VMg > VMgK > VMgNb > VMgCr > VMgSm, and the dehydrogenation selectivity was like VMg > VMgNb VMgSm > VMgCr > VMgK."
          [6] "Note that there is no correlation between the activity and reducibility, while the selectivity to propylene follows the order reducibility, i.e., the most easily reduced catalyst is the most selective."

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane. This consequently requires operating the process at low conversions in order to reach high selectivities."

"ODH can be carried out on various bulk metal oxides (e.g., V2O5), albeit in very low yield per pass. In fact, the corresponding supported systems give usually much higher activity and selectivity;"

"In all cases, the CH bond activation has also been identified as the rate determining step."

"It has been proposed that CH bond activation probably leads to Malkyl intermediates (not observed), which readily decompose to the corresponding 1-alkene by abstraction of a β-H of the alkyl chain by a surface oxygen atom (Scheme 6). An alternative concerted 2H-abstraction mechanism can be proposed by analogy with what has been proposed in the selective oxidation of alkanes on VPO catalysts"

"The selectivity of dehydrogenation vs formation of oxygenated products has been correlated to the distance between sites, which implies the need for site isolation."

"Elementary steps for these reactions and particularly the CH bond activation step have been a matter of debate for many years, and several reaction pathways can be proposed depending on the structure of the active sites: terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo species, isolated vs polynuclear species"

"The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

"Of several other systems that have been investigated, MOP (M = Ti, Zr, V, Fe), (99, 100) VMgOx, (98, 101, 102) VSiZrOx, (103, 104) and CrSiMO (M = Al or Zr) (105) show relatively high selectivities."

[1] "Alkanes are attractive alternative feedstocks for chemical synthesis. Compared to their aromatic counterparts, alkanes are both relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly. Unfortunately, few catalysts selectively oxidize alkanes."

[2] "Some of the few successful examples in the literature include: dehydrogenation of alkanes on V-Mg oxide [1], oxidation of propane to acrolein on Bi-Ag-V-Mo oxide [2], and oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride on V-P oxide [3]. Of these examples, only V-P-O is used to functionalize an alkane commercially."

[3] "Research into supported materials has been driven by two factors: supports (1) improve mechanical strength and thermal stability of the catalyst, and (2) increase dispersion of the active phase and, therefore, exposure of active sites."

[4] "Unfortunately, most supported V-P-O catalysts reported in the literature have relatively poor selectivities to maleic anhydride production compared to the unsupported catalysts."

[5] "The highest selectivities reported for the unsupported samples were only about 50%, much lower than  70% for the unsupported ones."

[6] "Phosphorus modification of PV0.0 changed the product selectivity significantly."

[7] "At low conversions, PV0.0 produced primarily a mixture of 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene but very little maleic anhydride [12]. At higher conversions, carbon oxides dominated."

[8] "In comparison, all phosphorus-modified catalysts had higher selectivities for maleic anhydride."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an energetically attractive route to the production of alkenes (i.e., RCH2CH3 + O2  RCHCH2 + H2O)."

[2] "The metal oxide catalyst containing Mo, V, and Nb (Mo16V4Nb2) is more active (10% of conversion at 559 K) and selective (100%) than other mixed-metal oxides (MoV, MoMn, MoTi, etc.)."

[3] "Burch and Swarnaka found that a molybdenumvanadiumniobium oxide (Mo:V:Nb = 6:3:1) is highly selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene. The presence of all three oxides is necessary in order to have an active and selective catalyst."

[4] "Their studies suggest that the active phase is based on molybdenum and vanadium. Niobium enhances the intrinsic activity of this combination and improves the reaction selectivity by inhibiting the total oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide."

[5] "Smits et al. found that niobium oxide shows a very high selectivity in this reaction although the conversion was very low"

[6] "The activity of the niobia was improved without diminishing its selectivity by adding other suitable elements (V, Cr, Mo)."

[7] "Vanadium neighbors promote the activity, while niobium neighbors promote the selectivity. Niobium is much more difficult to reduce than vanadium and this feature improves the selectivity, since facile reduction often causes low selectivity in these reactions."

[8] "The reaction's propene selectivity strongly depends on the nature of the catalysts used because propene's re-adsorption and interaction with the acidic sites leads to total oxidation."

"Propane is primarily converted to propene, but reasonably a route of direct conversion to carbon oxides also exist."

"The main route of propane conversion is through the formation of propene as the intermediate, although a side reaction of acrylate formation via propionate intermediate is possible."

"Vanadium ions play two main catalytic roles in the mechanism of synthesis of acrylonitrile on V-Sb-oxide: (i) they constitute the active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and (ii) catalyze the reoxidation of surface Sb-sites reduced in the propene to acrylonitrile conversion."

"The active phase for the selective synthesis of acrylonitrile from propane is a non-stoichiometric rutile-like vanadium antimonate with SbS+-oxide supported on it."

"Although specific data are not available, it is probable that non-stoichiometric properties of vanadium antimonate influence coordination and valence of surface vanadium ions and thus their activity."

[1] "Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen in a conventional flow reactor. Ethane and ethylene (C, compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion of CHI over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 OC."

[2] "EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li'O-] centers probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH4."

[3] "Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO2, are produced via CH3.; the coupling of two CH3. leads to C2H6, which is partly oxidized to C2H4."

[4] "The Li-promoted MgO contains no transition metals; thus it is a new type of oxidation catalyst on which thermally generated 0- ions activate methane."

[5] "Below 700 "C CO and CO2 are produced by reactions of CH3. with either surface O2- ions or gaseous O2. The latter reaction leads to chain reactions in which additional methyl radicals are generated."

[6] "One cannot exclude the additional formation of methyl radicals through branching gas-phase chain reactions."

"Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts. A peculiar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst."

"Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties. At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide."

"Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."

"Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions. This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice."

"According to this mechanism the substrate is oxidized by the solid and not directly by molecular oxygen of the gaseous phase. The rôle of dioxygen is to regenerate or maintain the oxidized state of the catalyst."

"The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one electron to the metal."

"Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will intervene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring."

"It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reaction since several steps as replenishing of oxygen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned."

[1] "The main conclusion of our study is that a good mix of acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface should permit a controlled orientation of the reaction towards selective products."

[2] "VMgO catalysts [134-142] which is reported to give the best performance (typically 60% of propane selectivity at 15% of propane conversion)"

[3] "According to Volta et al. [138,139] vanadium occupies isolated tetrahedral VO4 sites in Mg3V208, VO6 octahedra linked through edges in a-MgV206 and V207 units consisting of pairs of corner-sharing VO4 tetrahedra in c-MgV207. The obtained order of reactivity and selectivity for the phases were: c-MgzV207 > MgV206 > Mg3V208."

[4] "Concerning the reaction mechanism, a general agreement in literature is that the rate determining step of the reaction is the breaking of the first C-H bond, leading to a propyl species [32,156,157]. Moreover, Michalakos et al. [35] suggested the existence of a selectivity determining step which was related to the activity of the propyl species formed in the first step."

[5] "Isolated sites are believed to give high selectivities [35]."

[6] "The short V=O bond is proposed to initiate the H abstraction step whereas the V-O-V bridge participates in the subsequent steps where water is formed."

[7] "The basic idea of these formulations is that associating known solid phases active for the oxydehydrogenation reaction (ODHR) of propane and known solid phases active for the selective oxidation of propylene to acrolein, modified or not, catalyses the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein"

[8] "Activation of the reactant needs operating conditions (temperature as high as 500C for example) which are detrimental to the stability of the product."

[1] "Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions."

          [2] "Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature."

          [3] "The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support."

          [4] "For Mo surface densities below the polymolybdate monolayer values (5 Mo/nm2), no crystalline MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 were detected by these methods after thermal treatment at 393973 K."

          [5] "The size of these two-dimensional polymolybdate domains increased with increasing Mo surface density; this process led to a shift in the ν(MoO) Raman band, to changes in the near-edge X-ray absorption spectra, and to a decrease in the UVvisible edge energy with increasing surface density."

          [6] "Domain growth occurred via oligomerization of isolated tetrahedral MoOx as thermal treatments decreased the ZrO2 surface area available to disperse the MoOx species."

[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts prepared with different atomic ratios Cu/Th have been tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. These catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and selectivity change with the nature of the alkane."

[2] "Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products."

[3] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene."

[4] "As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of CuO may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."

[6] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]. Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A1 and A2 signals, respectively, (Fig. la) at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu2+ ions, characterized by M1, M2 and D signals (Fig. la), occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H2 and/or O2 treatment at different temperatures."

[7] "Therefore, the nature and the copper site concentrations have an important role to explain this difference in both reactions. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated [4-63 that the Cu2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and CuO crystallites for Cu/Th > 0.25 ratios."

[8] "Supposing that the reaction is first order, the selectivity S in propene is given by the following equation: S = (K-1)/K (1-C)[(1-C)K-1] / (E-1) C where K=k1/k2 is the coefficient of selectivity, k1 and k2 are the rate constants of dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation of propene, respectively, and C the conversion of propane."

[1] "Due to the large difference in the reactivities between paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons, related to the absence of both lone pairs and empty orbitals in the former, a reasonable activity of the catalyst in propane ammoxidation is usually obtained for reaction temperatures around 500-550°C; these temperatures are about 100-150°C higher than those required for propylene ammoxidation."

[2] "A very selective activation of propane to propylene occurs (selectivities higher than 80%), whereas direct ACN synthesis from propane is of secondary importance. ACN forms mainly from the intermediate propylene, but the contemporaneous presence of propylene and ACN is observed over the entire range of propane conversion."

[3] "Kinetic analysis shows that the main route of ACN formation passes through the intermediate formation of propylene and the limiting factor in the formation of ACN is the relative slowness of this step (formation of ACN from propylene) compared to that of the formation of the intermediate propylene."

[4] "V-Al-antimonate based mixed oxides are promising catalytic systems for the selective formation of ACN from propane in the absence of gas-phase additives"

[5] "Ga-antimonates (pure or modified with W, Ni and P) have been studied mainly by Osipova and Sokolovski [5] and show several structural and reactivity analogies to the V-antimonate based system."

[6] "Bi-V-molybdate based catalysts have been studied by Moro-oka et al. [6] and similar compositions have been patented by BP/Sohio [3]. These catalysts are selective to acrylonitrile mainly using high propane and ammonia concentrations and results suggest that they catalyze the step from propylene to acrylonitrile, whereas the first step from propane to propylene occurs in the homogeneous gas phase."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes. While nonoxidative dehydrogenation is endothermic and leads to the concurrent formation of carbon, which, in turn, deactivates the catalysts, ODH is exothermic by forming water as a byproduct and eliminating the coke formation, leading to stable catalysts."

[2] "Several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, and vanadium-based materials are among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are the other promising catalysts for ODH. Although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability."

[3] "It was concluded that ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts follow the same mechanism and that two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of the CH bonds in propane via a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism."

[4] "We predict that hydrogen abstraction by MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. We find that activating the methylene CH bond is 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond."

[5] "Our calculations suggest that a combined effect from both the methylene and the methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall kinetic isotopic effects from propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts."

"The oxidative coupling of methane has provided insight into an unusual type of oxidation catalysis, which involves both surface and gas-phase free-radical chemistry."

"The more effective catalysts may be divided into five groups: a) highly basic pure oxides, of which the early members of the lanthanide oxide series (excluding CeO,) are the best; b) Group IA or IIA ions supported on basic oxides (for example, Li/MgO, Ba/MgO and Sr/La,O,); c) monophasic oxides; d) a few transition metal oxides that contain Group IA ions; and e) any of these materials that are promoted with chloride ions."

"Apparently, the Na,O/Na,CO, layer inhibits electron transfer from CH; to the CeO,, and thus prevents CH; radicals from reacting with the surface."

"Oxidative coupling reactions generally take place at 650-880°C, at the limits of catalytic combustion where the availability of oxygen largely dictates the C2+ selectivity."

"The less basic set of sites is capable of catalyzing only the homolytic C-H bond cleavage in methane, directly producing CH3· radicals that result in C2H6 formation."

"Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions a C,H, selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C,H, conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58%."

"The yield of C,H, and C,H, is limited by secondary reactions of CH; radicals with the surface and by the further oxidation of C,H,, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase."

[1] "Lower alkanes (C1C4) are the main components in natural gas, coal bed gas, oil field associated gas, etc. Developing efficient strategies for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes to value-added chemicals or liquid fuels would provide a promising alternative for easing up the oil-demanding situation."

[2] "In most cases, the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by oxides occurs through the so-called Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, 4-5 in which the organic molecule reacts with the lattice oxygen, and then the oxygen vacancy is replenished by gaseous oxygen."

[3] "The roles that a good catalyst play involve (i) the effective activation of the first CH bond, (ii) the directional transformation of the resulting intermediates into the partial oxidation product, and (iii) a fast reoxidation of the reduced surface."

[4] "When the MO bond is too weak, such as a CrO, regeneration of the lattice oxygen can be a big issue in order to complete the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. If the MO bond is too strong, such as WO, the penalty to open the MO π bond is too high, such that abstracting an H atom from alkanes can be hard to accomplish."

[5] "The common feature of these reactions is that all of them use the high-valence transition metal oxides, such as vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, as catalysts."

[6] "We have carried out a theoretical study on the structurefunction relationship for the selective oxidation of lower alkanes (C1C4). The H abstraction mechanism has been examined over the model catalysts of high-valence d0 transition metal oxides in the tetrahedral coordination."

[1] "As is typically the case for partial oxidation there is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion, whether the reaction is carried out in "normal" catalytic fashion or by the cyclic "redox" modification (eq. (2))."

          [2] "CO2 is produced by two paths: a primary one, directly from CH3· (eq. (5)), and a secondary one, via ethylene. The latter is the main source of CO2 at higher (> 15%) conversions."

          [3] "The relative rates of reaction with the metal oxide for the various hydrocarbons-methane, ethane, ethylene, propene (eqs. (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)-are very similar to those for reactions of gas-phase radicals (CH3O·, HO· ), implying they are determined simply by C-H bond strengths."

          [4] "If radical H- abstraction is the key step in these reactions, as several studies strongly indicate [3,7,9], then (absent some degree of shape-selectivity, which will be difficult to achieve at the high temperatures required) the best catalyst should be essentially non-discriminating between various types of C-H bonds [10]."

[1] "Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify the elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts."

[2] "Propene is the primary product and carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts via propane and propene combustion."

[3] "These data indicate that the kinetically relevant steps in propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion involve the dissociation of CH bonds in the respective reactant."

[4] "These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism in which two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of C–H bond in propane."

[5] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers."

[6] "Propane ODH turnover rate are widely different on MoO3 and ZrMo2O8 because of apparent differences in the strength and accessibility of active MoO bonds."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes. As illustrated below for the case of propane conversion to propene, the central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2"

[2] "While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion."

[3] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[4] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[5] "Although a large body of literature exists on the ODH of alkanes, current understanding of the elementary processes involved in both the formation of alkenes and their subsequent combustion is limited. In particular, there is a lack of understanding concerning the relationships of catalyst composition and structure to catalyst activity and selectivity."

[6] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[7] "Some progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been reported recently for metal oxide-supported vanadia."

[8] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts. The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."

[9] "Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

[1] "Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed, and some 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins are anually produced this way."

[2] "Finely dispersed platinum and oxide-supported chromium appear as the most interesting catalysts from an industrial point of view."

[3] "There is some controversy concerning the oxidation state of chromium active for dehydrogenation of alkanes. Both Cr(II) and Cr(III) were proposed as the active state quite early on. The dominating view in the modern literature is that III is the most active oxidation state for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from II."

[4] "Concerning the dispersion of active chromium, below mono-layer coverage and on both alumina, silica and zirconia, a linear relationship is found between the number of mononuclear Cr(VI)/Cr(V) species after calcination, and catalytic activity after reduction."

[5] "A recurrent idea is that CH activation could involve a CrO pair."

[6] "Burwell et al. and later Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt proposed that dehydrogenation is initiated by physisorption of the alkane on coordinatively unsaturated Cr(III) centers. A CH bond is subsequently activated and new OH and Cralkyl bonds are being formed"

[7] "According to this mechanism, the alkene is formed as a result of hydrogen transfer from the alkyl to chromium, whereas regeneration of the catalytic site and formation of H2 concludes the catalytic cycle"

[8] "A mechanism consisting of the following three reaction steps is found to be viable: (1) CH activation of ethane according to -bond metathesis, accompanied by formation of OH and CrC bonds, (2) -H transfer to chromium with subsequent loss of ethene, and (3) regeneration of the chromium site by means of -bond metathesis with subsequent loss of H2."

[9] "Based on the computed energies, an alternative mechanism is formulated in which CH activation takes place at a reactive hydridochromium complex formed in reaction (2) (above), rather than at more stable chromium species with three oxygen ligands."

[10] "The importance of this alternative mechanism relies on the ability to maintain a reactive hydridochromium site, i.e. to prevent formation of more stable species in which chromium is covalently bonded to three oxygen ligands. This ability is a sensitive function of the local structure about chromium."

[11] "A major challenge in computational studies of any of the Croxide systems is to develop realistic models of the chromium surface sites."

[1] "Recent reports have demonstrated that N2O is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides."

          [2] "The O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, have been postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction."

          [3] "The stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with O- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium heptamolybdate at pH = 2."

          [4] "Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C."

          [5] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."

"Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates was often carried out over supported transition metal oxides. Among various catalysts employed, V2O5 [1012] and MoO3 [1,1315] were considered to be the most active and selective catalysts, while recent studies showed that Fe [1618] and W [19,20] oxides are also of great promise."

"However, a high temperature is generally required for the activation of methane, and at such temperature, the desired oxygenates would be quickly oxidized into unwanted carbon oxides. Therefore, in spite of great effort, the single-pass yield of oxygenates is still quite low, usually less than 4%, far from fulfilling the industrial requirement [7]."

"We concentrated on the activation of CH bonds by terminal oxygens [ O] and bridge oxygens [O]. We considered eight possible mechanisms."

"H abstraction is a 1e process (Fig. 4), which involves radical formation with the metal center being reduced formally by one unit. Here we considered H abstractions both by terminal oxygens (T6 and T7) and bridge oxygens (T8)."

"Among the eight pathways considered here, the most favorable pathway is anti-H abstraction (T6) by terminal oxygen with the exception of W3O9, where (2 + 2) (T1) appears to be the best pathway."

"We also infer that the interplay between the MO bond polarity and the M O p bond strength may counterbalance the reactivity and the selectivity, hence V and Mo oxides are the most active and selective catalysts experimentally observed [1,1015]."

"A fairly good compliance between H abstraction mechanism and experimental evidences supports that H abstraction is the working mechanism for the activation of alkanes on most high valence transition metal oxides."

"Single and binary metal molybdates, supported on silica (80 wt% active phase/20 wt% SiO2), having the formula AMoO4, where A = Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and/or Zn, and some ternary molybdates having the formula Ni0.45Co0.45X0.066MoO4, where X = P, Bi, Fe, Cr, V, and Ce, were investigated for the oxydehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"The reaction is catalytic and is first order in propane disappearance, consistent with the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen being the rate limiting step."

"At 560C and atmospheric pressure, the highest propane conversion and highest propylene yields are obtained with NiMoO4/SiO2 (16% at 27% conversion), closely followed by Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4/SiO2."

"Addition of redox elements V, Fe, Ce, and Cr enhances the activity of the NiComolybdates, with Cr addition holding most promise by retaining high selectivity at enhanced conversions and hence a possibility for desired lower process temperature operation."

"Metal molybdates are particularly attractive since they exhibit, as do V-based systems, high activity for propane activation at relatively low temperature."

"By far the most studied systems for propane upgrading center around vanadium (3), vanadiumantimony (4), vanadium molybdenum (5), and vanadiumphosphorus based catalysts (6). Vanadium based systems activate propane at fairly low temperatures (down to 400C), and it has been proposed that their effectiveness might stem from the metalloradical character of vanadium (7)."

[1] "Models of Cr(III)silica were used to study CH activation in ethane by oxidative addition as a possible route to catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "The dominant view in the modern literature is that chromium(III) is the oxidation state showing the highest activity for dehydrogenation, possibly with minor contributions from the II state."

[3] "One crucial question concerns the mechanism of CH activation, for which the focus has been on activation through direct interaction with chromium."

[4] "The two most relevant ones are oxidative and electrophilic addition. Electrophilic addition is also known as -bond metathesis, since metalligand and CH bonds are replaced by metal carbon and ligandhydrogen bonds. Conversely, in oxidative addition of ethane, carbon and hydrogen bind directly to the metal as the CH bond is broken."

[5] "Based on the present computations, CH activation by oxidative addition appears possible on DeRossi-type species, i.e. on CrOH moieties bonded to the surface via two oxygen bridges. The computed activation energy for this initial step is 160 kJ mol1."

[6] "The overall activation energy for dehydrogenation based on oxidative addition is therefore fairly high and on a level with that of the -bond metathesis reaction on unstrained three-bridge species."

[7] "CH activation by oxidative addition thus seems to be an unlikely route to catalytic dehydrogenation for Cr(III)silica catalysts."

[8] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through two oxygen bridges, the preferred mode of -hydrogen transfer is via a stereochemical rearrangement of the ethylhydridochromium(V) complex, followed by hydrogen transfer to the hydrido ligand with release of H2."

[9] "On sites where chromium is linked to the silica surface through three oxygen bridges, we have not been able to optimize any ethylhydridochromium(V) structure and CH activation according to oxidative addition seems to be excluded."

[1] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures and does not suffer from the detrimental effects of coking"

[2] "However, this selective oxidation is difficult to achieve due to the tendency of propylene to overoxidize to CO and CO2 under the reaction conditions."

[3] "Recent reviews and reports on this subject have suggested that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH"

[4] "The best catalyst performance was observed for materials with 10-18% vanadia content, for which activities were as high as 180 mmol (g cat)−1 h−1, and intrinsic selectivities maximized at about 90%"

[5] "Kinetic analyses of the propane ODH reactions at 606 K showed that the value of k1 (the rate of propane ODH; L mol−1 s−1) was three times greater for the TMP-derived catalysts than for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by wet impregnation"

[6] "However, the k3 values (the rate constants for propylene combustion; L mol−1 s−1) were similar for the two types of catalysts. The latter result is significant, in that dramatic improvements in propane ODH catalysis appear to hinge on development of catalysts with a much lower activity for propylene oxidation (low values of k3)"

[7] "The TMP synthetic route offered the potential to produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities relative to catalysts that were known for propane ODH. It was also hoped that use of this method might provide more controlled transformations to well-defined materials with high surface densities of the desired catalytic sites."

[8] "The improved properties observed for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by the TMP cothermolysis method may be at least partially attributed to higher surface areas and improved dispersions of VOx species relative to those in catalysts prepared by conventional means."

[1] "This review deals with the catalytic conversion of n-butane by oxidative dehydrogenation as an alternative process to direct dehydrogenation, making special reference to the catalytic systems used, kinetic studies performed and reaction mechanisms proposed."

[2] "Particular attention is also focused on the hydrocarbon activation process and on the main factors governing catalytic efficiency."

[1] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]. All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Brönsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O• or O2•."

[2] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."

[3] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1). In the first one, the n-butane molecule is dehydrogenated with the concerted removal of two hydrogen atoms as H• and H+ on an acidbase VIVO couple (figure 1a) [29]."

[4] "In fact, as already proposed O−, superoxo O2− or peroxo species can be involved in the alkane dehydrogenation and interconversion pathways exist between these species (figure 4) [31]."

[5] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species and that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72] and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov et al. [73]."

[6] "The activation mechanism of light alkanes is discussed in view of the catalytic properties, and both, bulk and surface properties of active phases."

[7] "Different activation processes are proposed depending upon the catalyst used but all have the same H abstracting sites corresponding to O)."

[8] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."

[1] "Vanadium silicalite is one of the most efficient catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (eq 4)."

[2] "The selectivities and activities for propene formation, extrapolated to 0% propane conversion, were 86.6% and 2.1 mmol g-1 h-1 at 400 C, 82.1% and 5.6 mmol g-1 h-1 at 450 C, and 73.2% and 19 mmol g-1 h-1 at 500 C."

[3] "An analogous system with 15 wt % V2O5, prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of ammonium metavanadate onto silica, exhibited a lower selectivity and a similar activity [67% and 0.031 mmol (mol V)-1 s-1, under similar reaction conditions]."

[4] "The V2O5·6SiO2 xerogel is also similar to bulk V2O5 in its ODH of propane (which exhibits a selectivity of about 80%, with a catalyst surface area of 3 m2 g-1) and rapidly declining selectivity with increasing conversions."

[5] "Future work will focus on the production of ternary V/Si/M/O xerogels via a thermolysishydrolysis procedure using 5 and metal alkoxides."

"A new catalytic approach to the oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene was presented using Dy-doped (oxy)halides as catalysts. These systems operate as melts, are stable under reaction conditions, have long life times, and most impressively do not produce any chlorinated byproducts, even though operated at rather high temperatures (600 C), that were the culprits in earlier catalytic systems using halogen containing catalysts or halide co-feeds."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves primary and secondary reactions, the rates of which can be measured from the effects of residence time on formation rates of alkenes and COx (CO and CO2)."

[2] "Catalytic turnovers for oxidative dehydrogenation of MoOx and VOx proceed via reduction-oxidation cycles. These cycles involve the removal and replacement of lattice oxygen atoms via pathways first proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[3] "Reaction rates are limited by the reduction step, which involves the activation of the weakest CH bond in alkanes on a pair of lattice oxygen atoms at the surface of reducible oxide domains."

[4] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per Mo-atom) increased with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy, as the latter approaches values typical of saturated polymolybdate monolayers."

[5] "These trends indicate that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as larger domains become increasingly able to accept electron density and to stabilize transition states required in rate-determining reduction steps relative to smaller domains with higher-lying LUMO states."

[6] "The extent of reduction also increased with increasing VOx surface density, consistent with the more reducible nature and higher catalytic reactivity of larger VOx domains and with the kinetic relevance of the CH bond activation step, which requires the formal reduction of V5+ centers."

[7] "For all active oxides, ODH turnover rates (per active metal atom) increased monotonically as LMCT energies decreased. The exponential dependence evident from the data in Fig. 13 suggests a relation between the energy required for these electronic transitions and the activation energies for kinetically-relevant steps, the activation of methylene CH bonds in propane reactants using lattice oxygens for this reaction."

[8] "The extent of reduction for all samples (0.0620.30 e/V) was much smaller than required for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V3+ or V4+ and increased with increasing reductant/oxidant ratio, as required by mechanistic considerations based on the prevalent redox cycles and the kinetic relevance of CH bond activation steps."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."

[2] "The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1). Alkenes are primary ODH products while CO and CO2 (COx) can form via either secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes."

[3] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[4] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

[5] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[6] "The apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this same sequence."

[7] "A further decrease in the Lewis acidity of the cations in VOx and MoOx by modifications with oxides or supports of moderate or strong basicity (e.g., MgO, Cs2O), which increase the electron density at cation sites, should lead to less favorable adsorption of alkenes (smaller Δ(ΔHads), and to lower ΔE1  ΔE3 and k3/k1 value."

[1] "The partial oxidation of methane into more useful chemicals such as methanol, ethylene and benzene has been investigated extensively, although yields for these products have been poor"

          [2] "Recent work5 in our laboratory has demonstrated that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) in the presence of O2 has high activity for abstracting H from CH4 to form ·CH3 radicals."

          [3] "This suggests that C2H6 and C2H4 (C2 compounds) are produced by a coupling between two gaseous ·CH3 radicals formed on this catalyst."

          [4] "We report here our success in converting CH4 to C2 compounds in high yields in conventional catalytic conditions."

[1] "The activation of parafns is harder than that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the former. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under the conditions required to activate parafns, thus limiting selectivity"

[2] "The initial activation of the CH bond of the hydrocarbon by the catalyst requires the existence of an afnity between the alkane and the surface of the catalyst. The acidbase interaction between the hydrocarbon molecule and the surface of the oxide promotes the approach of the former to the active site"

[3] "The presence of surface electrophilic oxygen species is associated with the non-selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, whereas nucleophilic oxygen species promote selective oxidation"

[4] "Site isolation proves to improve selectivity"

[5] "The oxidation of ethane involves activation of the organic molecule and of the oxidant. Activation of the oxidant depends on its nature. The activation of molecular oxygen requires the presence of a reducible oxide."

[6] "The relative ease in the removal of lattice oxygen is frequently characterized by the ease of catalyst reduction with hydrogen or hydrocarbon. Some reports show that the most selective catalysts are less reducible although sometimes this trend is reversed."

[7] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to be involved in the catalytic oxidation of ethane. Furthermore, several experimental evidences support the relevance of bridging oxygens for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[8] "Surface coverage alters the population ratio of (VOV)/(VO-support) bonds. This trend is not observed on silica-supported vanadia, where isolated surface vanadium oxide species are dominant up to monolayer coverage."

[1] "The key issue is therefore the development of a catalyst activating only the C-H bonds of an alkane molecule."

[2] "The catalytic systems that contain ions and oxides of IA and IIA groups (e.g., Li2CO3/MgO) show selective behavior in this reaction, but the optimal temperature for these kinds of catalysts is high (above about 8708K)."

[3] "The catalytic activity for catalysts based on reducible oxides is usually significantly higher, but selectivities to alkenes is lower in comparison with selectivities of the systems described above."

[4] "On the basis of the literature data (9), the mechanisms for ODH of alkanes seem to involve the following characteristic steps:
1. Interactions of alkane with the surface of the catalyst (weak/physical adsorption).
2. Rupture of the CH bond leading to the formation of the alkyl species.
3. Reaction of the alkyl species with an adjacent surface oxygen (b-elimination) and formation of alkene.
4. Cyclic reduction/reoxidation of the catalyst."

[5] "It has been shown (86) that the interaction of an organic molecule with various defects led to the cleavage of the C-H bond, which proceeded by the transfer of two electrons to the empty vanadium surface levels and the formation of adsorbed alkoxy and surface hydroxyl species."

[6] "Isolation of vanadium ions (57, 58) inside the zeolite matrix leads to a catalyst with relatively high yields of propene. The tetrahedron structure of an isolated VO4 was proposed as the active site in the VAPO-5 catalyst."

[7] "Strength and reducibility of the bridging V-O-support oxygen ions play an important role, and the formation of the acid and/or basic centers depends on the nature of the support and, in the case of the doped catalysts, on the basicity of the additive."

[8] "The coordination number of the active center also affects the path of the ODH reaction. For example, the coordination number of vanadium higher than four favors the insertion of oxygen into an alkane molecule and leads to the formation of partially oxygenated products or carbon oxides (57)."

"Supported chromium oxide catalysts are extensively studied for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is especially of great industrial importance because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

"The catalytic performances of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation was discovered by Frey and Huppke in 1933 165-166 and is generally known as the Houdry catalyst. 167 This catalyst catalyzes the conversion of e.g. propane to propene, butane to butadiene, and ethylbenzene to styrene at relatively high temperature (450700 C) and low pressure (15 bar)."

"Because of the different side reactions (cracking and coking), due to the alumina support, the catalyst is easily deactivated and, consequently, regeneration is required."

"Recently, the group of Indovina has studied the activity of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.15 They have shown that mononuclear Cr3+ species are the active centers, whereas surface oxygens adjacent to this Cr3+ ion are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site."

"Upon reduction, this Cr3+ is oxidized to mainly monochromate/polychromate and some Cr5+, while reduction results in the formation of (pseudo-) octahedral Cr3+, (pseudo-) octahedral Cr2+ and (pseudo-) tetrahedral Cr2+."

"Burwell proposed a model for the mechanism of the reaction. The site was supposed to consist of a Cr3+ cation and an oxygen anion, the Cr3+ cation being accessible from the gas phase because it was situated next to a surface anion vacancy. Hydrogen was assumed to become adsorbed by heterolytical fission with the hydride ion becoming connected to the cation in the surface anion vacancy and the proton being bonded by oxygen."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions are also an attractive alternative to classical dehydrogenations. In fact, the dehydrogenation of paraffins to give the corresponding olefins and H2 is a strongly endothermic process which has to be carried out at temperatures above 600C."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins, the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]."

[3] "It appears that tetrahedral V5+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes."

[4] "According to the mechanism proposed for the selective oxidation of n-butane on VPO catalysts, the first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary carbon atom. However, depending on the catalysts, this abstraction can give rise to the formation of three different intermediates (Fig. 9), that after a second H-abstraction can be transformed into olefins, O-containing partial oxidation products or carbon oxides."

[5] "The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support. In addition, and concluding from the most selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins."

[6] "The selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."

[7] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."

[8] "Several factors can contribute to their catalytic behavior, i.e. coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of vanadium species), reducibility of active sites and acid-base character of catalysts and metal oxide support."

[9] "The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species."

[10] "The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these materials. In addition, the appearance of acid and/or basic sites, that strongly depend on the nature of the metal oxide support, determines the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depending on the alkane fed."
