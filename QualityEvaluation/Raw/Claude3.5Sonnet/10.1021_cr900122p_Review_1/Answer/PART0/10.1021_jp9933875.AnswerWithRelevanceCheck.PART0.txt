          [1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes."

[2] "The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1). Alkenes are primary ODH products while CO and CO2 (COx) can form via either secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes."

[3] "Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:
1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. CH cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2"

[4] "The activation of CH bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the CH bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields."

[5] "Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts."

[6] "The apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this same sequence."

[7] "A further decrease in the Lewis acidity of the cations in VOx and MoOx by modifications with oxides or supports of moderate or strong basicity (e.g., MgO, Cs2O), which increase the electron density at cation sites, should lead to less favorable adsorption of alkenes (smaller Δ(ΔHads), and to lower ΔE1  ΔE3 and k3/k1 value."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors including catalyst composition, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation. The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, as secondary combustion of alkenes limits yields to around 30% for propane and higher alkanes.

Catalyst composition plays a crucial role in ODH efficiency. VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts have been extensively studied, with their performance influenced by reducibility, Lewis acidity, and oxygen mobility. The activity and selectivity of catalysts follow the trend VOx > MoOx > WOx when supported on ZrO2. Ideal catalysts for selective ODH should have intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility.

The reaction mechanism involves several steps: weak adsorption of the alkane on lattice oxygen, C-H bond activation through hydrogen abstraction, alkene desorption, OH group recombination, and reoxidation of reduced metal centers. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation, which is influenced by the reducibility of the metal oxide and the basicity of the lattice oxygen.

The challenge in achieving high selectivity stems from the fact that CH bond activation in alkane ODH requires the same sites as CH bond activation in alkene combustion. This similarity makes selective poisoning strategies ineffective for improving alkene yields.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By modifying the catalyst support or adding promoters, the Lewis acidity of the active sites can be decreased. This leads to less favorable adsorption of alkenes, resulting in lower k3/k1 ratios and potentially higher alkene yields. For example, supporting VOx on more basic oxides like MgO instead of acidic supports like Al2O3 or SiO2 can improve alkene yields.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors. Catalyst design aims to optimize the balance between reducibility, acidity, and oxygen mobility to maximize alkene production while minimizing undesired combustion reactions. The choice of support material, metal oxide, and potential promoters all contribute to fine-tuning this balance.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个复杂的过程，受到多种因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应机理和位点隔离。ODH的主要挑战在于同时实现高选择性和高转化率，因为烯烃的二次燃烧将丙烷和更高级烷烃的产率限制在约30%。

催化剂组成在ODH效率中起着关键作用。VOx-、MoOx-和WOx-基催化剂已被广泛研究，其性能受还原性、Lewis酸性和氧移动性的影响。当负载在ZrO2上时，催化剂的活性和选择性遵循VOx > MoOx > WOx的趋势。选择性ODH的理想催化剂应具有中等还原性、弱Lewis酸中心和高氧移动性。

反应机理包括几个步骤：烷烃在晶格氧上的弱吸附、通过氢抽提的C-H键活化、烯烃脱附、OH基团重组以及还原金属中心的再氧化。决定反应速率的步骤是C-H键活化，这受到金属氧化物的还原性和晶格氧的碱性的影响。

实现高选择性的挑战在于，烷烃ODH中的CH键活化需要与烯烃燃烧中的CH键活化相同的位点。这种相似性使得选择性毒化策略在提高烯烃产率方面无效。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题上起着关键作用。通过修改催化剂载体或添加助剂，可以降低活性位点的Lewis酸性。这导致烯烃吸附的减少，从而降低k3/k1比率，潜在地提高烯烃收率。例如，将VOx负载在更碱性的氧化物（如MgO）上，而不是酸性载体（如Al2O3或SiO2）上，可以提高烯烃收率。

ODH过程的效率受到这些因素的共同影响。催化剂设计旨在优化还原性、酸性和氧移动性之间的平衡，以最大化烯烃产量，同时最小化不希望的燃烧反应。载体材料、金属氧化物和潜在的助剂的选择都有助于微调这种平衡。
