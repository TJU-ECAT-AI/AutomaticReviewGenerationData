          "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are extensively studied for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is especially of great industrial importance because it represents a route to obtain alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."

"The catalytic performances of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation was discovered by Frey and Huppke in 1933 165-166 and is generally known as the Houdry catalyst. 167 This catalyst catalyzes the conversion of e.g. propane to propene, butane to butadiene, and ethylbenzene to styrene at relatively high temperature (450700 C) and low pressure (15 bar)."

"Because of the different side reactions (cracking and coking), due to the alumina support, the catalyst is easily deactivated and, consequently, regeneration is required."

"Recently, the group of Indovina has studied the activity of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.15 They have shown that mononuclear Cr3+ species are the active centers, whereas surface oxygens adjacent to this Cr3+ ion are most probably involved in the dehydrogenation site."

"Upon reduction, this Cr3+ is oxidized to mainly monochromate/polychromate and some Cr5+, while reduction results in the formation of (pseudo-) octahedral Cr3+, (pseudo-) octahedral Cr2+ and (pseudo-) tetrahedral Cr2+."

"Burwell proposed a model for the mechanism of the reaction. The site was supposed to consist of a Cr3+ cation and an oxygen anion, the Cr3+ cation being accessible from the gas phase because it was situated next to a surface anion vacancy. Hydrogen was assumed to become adsorbed by heterolytical fission with the hydride ion becoming connected to the cation in the surface anion vacancy and the proton being bonded by oxygen."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an important industrial process for converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into more valuable alkenes. Various catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, play a crucial role in this reaction.

Chromium-based catalysts, particularly Cr/Al2O3 (Houdry catalyst) and Cr/ZrO2, have been extensively studied for alkane dehydrogenation. These catalysts operate at high temperatures (450-700°C) and low pressures (1-5 bar) to convert alkanes like propane to propene, butane to butadiene, and ethylbenzene to styrene.

The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion include:

1. Side reactions: Cracking and coking occur, especially on alumina supports, leading to catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration.
2. High temperatures: The process requires elevated temperatures, which can promote undesired reactions and affect energy efficiency.
3. Catalyst stability: Deactivation due to coking and other factors necessitates catalyst regeneration, impacting process continuity.

Proposed reaction mechanisms involve:

1. C-H bond activation: The initial step in the dehydrogenation process.
2. M-alkyl intermediates: Formation of metal-alkyl species as reaction intermediates.
3. 2H-abstraction: Removal of hydrogen atoms from the alkane to form the alkene.

Recent studies on Cr/ZrO2 catalysts suggest that mononuclear Cr3+ species act as active centers, with adjacent surface oxygens involved in the dehydrogenation site. Burwell proposed a mechanism where the active site consists of a Cr3+ cation and an oxygen anion, with hydrogen adsorption occurring through heterolytic fission.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, such as mononuclear Cr3+ species, the catalyst can promote the desired dehydrogenation reaction while minimizing side reactions. This approach can lead to improved selectivity and overall process efficiency.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by factors such as catalyst composition, reaction conditions, active site nature, and support material. Balancing these factors is key to developing catalysts that can achieve both high selectivity and high conversion in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个将低成本饱和烃转化为更有价值的烯烃的重要工业过程。各种催化剂，包括块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，在这个反应中起着关键作用。

以铬为基础的催化剂，特别是Cr/Al2O3（Houdry催化剂）和Cr/ZrO2，已被广泛研究用于烷烃脱氢。这些催化剂在高温（450-700°C）和低压（1-5巴）下运行，将烷烃如丙烷转化为丙烯，丁烷转化为丁二烯，以及乙苯转化为苯乙烯。

在实现高选择性和高转化率方面的主要挑战包括：

1. 副反应：特别是在氧化铝载体上发生裂解和结焦，导致催化剂失活和需要频繁再生。
2. 高温：该过程需要高温，这可能促进不期望的反应并影响能源效率。
3. 催化剂稳定性：由于结焦和其他因素导致的失活需要催化剂再生，影响过程的连续性。

提出的反应机理包括：

1. C-H键活化：脱氢过程的初始步骤。
2. M-烷基中间体：形成金属-烷基物种作为反应中间体。
3. 2H-抽提：从烷烃中移除氢原子形成烯烃。

最近对Cr/ZrO2催化剂的研究表明，单核Cr3+物种作为活性中心，相邻的表面氧参与脱氢位点。Burwell提出了一种机理，其中活性位点由Cr3+阳离子和氧阴离子组成，氢的吸附通过异裂作用进行。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。通过隔离活性位点，如单核Cr3+物种，催化剂可以促进所需的脱氢反应，同时最小化副反应。这种方法可以提高选择性和整体过程效率。

ODH过程的效率受到诸多因素的共同影响，如催化剂组成、反应条件、活性位点性质和载体材料。平衡这些因素是开发能够在烷烃氧化脱氢中实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂的关键。
