          [1] "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of light alkanes that have recently been reviewed [3]. All these mechanisms involve sites with specific properties like strong Brönsted acidity, or strong Lewis acidity coupled with basic oxygens, or strong electrophilic species like O• or O2•."

[2] "The primary activation of the n-butane molecule has been shown from kinetic isotope effect studies [25] to involve rupture of a methylene CH bond."

[3] "Several mechanisms involving different sites have been proposed for the first step of the reaction (figure 1). In the first one, the n-butane molecule is dehydrogenated with the concerted removal of two hydrogen atoms as H• and H+ on an acidbase VIVO couple (figure 1a) [29]."

[4] "In fact, as already proposed O−, superoxo O2− or peroxo species can be involved in the alkane dehydrogenation and interconversion pathways exist between these species (figure 4) [31]."

[5] "Site isolation in both cases plays a role in the stabilization of these active species intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species and that may correspond to those proposed by Gleaves [72] and more recently in other catalytic system by Panov et al. [73]."

[6] "The activation mechanism of light alkanes is discussed in view of the catalytic properties, and both, bulk and surface properties of active phases."

[7] "Different activation processes are proposed depending upon the catalyst used but all have the same H abstracting sites corresponding to O)."

[8] "Efficient catalysts are those such as VPO or VSbO based systems that provide particular mechanisms of hydrocarbon activation that clearly overcome the activation step."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms:

1. Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides (e.g., VPO, VSbO) and supported systems are used. These catalysts provide specific mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation that overcome the initial activation step.

2. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge in ODH. This is due to the reactivity of the desired products and the possibility of over-oxidation.

3. Reaction mechanisms:
   a) C-H bond activation: This typically involves the rupture of a methylene C-H bond, as shown in n-butane activation studies.
   b) 2H-abstraction: Some mechanisms propose the concerted removal of two hydrogen atoms.
   c) Involvement of various oxygen species: O−, superoxo O2−, and peroxo species can participate in alkane dehydrogenation.

4. Active sites: These often involve specific properties such as strong Brønsted or Lewis acidity, basic oxygens, or electrophilic species like O− or O2−. The formation of these active species may be related to structural defects or created through thermally activated electron transfer.

5. Site isolation: This plays a crucial role in stabilizing active intermediates between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species, which helps address selectivity issues by preventing over-oxidation.

6. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the interplay between the catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and the specific mechanism of alkane activation. Catalysts that can efficiently activate the C-H bond without promoting over-oxidation are most desirable.

The overall efficiency of the ODH process depends on balancing these factors to achieve high conversion of the alkane while maintaining high selectivity to the desired alkene product. The nature of the catalyst, particularly its ability to provide isolated active sites with the right type of oxygen species, is crucial in this balance.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用：

1. 催化剂：使用了体相金属氧化物（如VPO、VSbO）和负载型体系。这些催化剂提供了特定的碳氢化合物活化机制，克服了初始活化步骤。

2. 挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率是ODH的主要挑战。这是由于目标产物的反应性和过度氧化的可能性造成的。

3. 反应机理：
   a) C-H键活化：这通常涉及亚甲基C-H键的断裂，如正丁烷活化研究所示。
   b) 2H-抽提：一些机理提出了两个氢原子的协同去除。
   c) 各种氧物种的参与：O−、超氧O2−和过氧物种可以参与烷烃脱氢。

4. 活性位点：这些通常涉及特定性质，如强布朗斯特或路易斯酸性、碱性氧或亲电性物种如O−或O2−。这些活性物种的形成可能与结构缺陷有关，或通过热激活的电子转移产生。

5. 位点隔离：这在稳定晶格氧和吸附氧物种之间的活性中间物种方面起着关键作用，通过防止过度氧化有助于解决选择性问题。

6. 过程效率：效率受催化剂性质、反应条件和烷烃活化的特定机制之间相互作用的影响。能够有效活化C-H键而不促进过度氧化的催化剂最为理想。

ODH过程的整体效率取决于平衡这些因素，以实现烷烃的高转化率，同时保持对所需烯烃产物的高选择性。催化剂的性质，特别是其提供具有正确氧物种类型的隔离活性位点的能力，在这种平衡中至关重要。
