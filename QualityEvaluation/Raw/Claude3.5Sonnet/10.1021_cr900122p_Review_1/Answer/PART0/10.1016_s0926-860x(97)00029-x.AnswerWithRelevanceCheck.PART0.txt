          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions are also an attractive alternative to classical dehydrogenations. In fact, the dehydrogenation of paraffins to give the corresponding olefins and H2 is a strongly endothermic process which has to be carried out at temperatures above 600C."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxides have been reported to be selective catalysts in a number of catalytic reactions, i.e. the oxidation of methanol, methane and olefins, the oxidation and ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx [8-16]. Recently, they have been shown to be selective catalysts in the ODH reactions [17-21]."

[3] "It appears that tetrahedral V5+-species are active and selective sites in the ODH of C2-C4 alkanes."

[4] "According to the mechanism proposed for the selective oxidation of n-butane on VPO catalysts, the first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary carbon atom. However, depending on the catalysts, this abstraction can give rise to the formation of three different intermediates (Fig. 9), that after a second H-abstraction can be transformed into olefins, O-containing partial oxidation products or carbon oxides."

[5] "The design of new catalytic systems should consider that vanadium must be very dispersed on the metal oxide support. In addition, and concluding from the most selective catalysts, vanadium must be stabilized in a low coordination number in order to limit the consecutive reactions of the formed olefins."

[6] "The selectivity of bulk V205 in the ODH of short chain alkanes [22-26] is enhanced when vanadium oxide is mixed or supported on other metal oxides, increasing the formation rate of the desired olefins."

[7] "From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behavior depend on the metal oxide support."

[8] "Several factors can contribute to their catalytic behavior, i.e. coordination number and distance between active sites (dispersion of vanadium species), reducibility of active sites and acid-base character of catalysts and metal oxide support."

[9] "The acid-base character of metal oxide support influences the dispersion of vanadium on the surface of the support, as well as the nature of the vanadium species."

[10] "The environment of the V-species plays an important role in the catalytic behavior of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The strength and reducibility of bridging V-O-support oxygen ions determine the catalytic activity of these materials. In addition, the appearance of acid and/or basic sites, that strongly depend on the nature of the metal oxide support, determines the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depending on the alkane fed."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

1. Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with supported vanadium oxides showing particular selectivity. Tetrahedral V5+ species are identified as active and selective sites for C2-C4 alkane ODH. The selectivity of bulk V2O5 is enhanced when mixed or supported on other metal oxides.

2. Support effects: The metal oxide support significantly influences the nature of vanadium species and catalytic behavior. The acid-base character of the support affects vanadium dispersion and the nature of active sites.

3. Active sites: The coordination number, dispersion, and reducibility of vanadium species play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance. Isolated VO4 tetrahedra appear to be highly selective for ODH reactions.

4. Reaction mechanism: The process typically involves C-H bond activation through H-abstraction. The first H-abstraction occurs from a secondary carbon atom, followed by a second H-abstraction. Depending on the catalyst, this can lead to the formation of olefins, partial oxidation products, or carbon oxides.

5. Site isolation: Highly dispersed vanadium on the support with low coordination numbers is crucial for selectivity. This helps limit consecutive reactions of formed olefins.

6. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a major challenge in ODH processes. Balancing these factors is crucial for overall process efficiency.

7. Redox properties: The reducibility of V-O-support bonds impacts catalytic activity, while the presence of V=O bonds can promote oxygen insertion reactions.

The interplay between these factors collectively determines the efficiency of the ODH process. Catalyst design must balance these elements to achieve high dispersion of vanadium species, appropriate acid-base properties, and suitable redox characteristics. Site isolation through proper support selection and controlled vanadium loading is crucial for addressing selectivity issues by minimizing consecutive reactions of olefins.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

1. 催化剂：使用了块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中负载型钒氧化物表现出特殊的选择性。四面体V5+物种被确定为C2-C4烷烃ODH的活性和选择性位点。当V2O5与其他金属氧化物混合或负载时，其选择性得到提高。

2. 载体效应：金属氧化物载体显著影响钒物种的性质和催化行为。载体的酸碱性影响钒的分散和活性位点的性质。

3. 活性位点：钒物种的配位数、分散度和可还原性在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。孤立的VO4四面体似乎对ODH反应具有高度选择性。

4. 反应机理：该过程通常涉及通过H原子抽取的C-H键活化。第一次H原子抽取发生在次级碳原子上，随后是第二次H原子抽取。根据催化剂的不同，这可能导致烯烃、部分氧化产物或碳氧化物的形成。

5. 位点隔离：在载体上高度分散且具有低配位数的钒对选择性至关重要。这有助于限制生成烯烃的连续反应。

6. 挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是ODH过程的一个主要挑战。平衡这些因素对整体过程效率至关重要。

7. 氧化还原性质：V-O-载体键的可还原性影响催化活性，而V=O键的存在可以促进氧插入反应。

这些因素的相互作用共同决定了ODH过程的效率。催化剂设计必须平衡这些元素，以实现钒物种的高度分散、适当的酸碱性和合适的氧化还原特性。通过适当的载体选择和控制钒负载量来实现位点隔离对解决选择性问题至关重要，因为这可以最小化烯烃的连续反应。
