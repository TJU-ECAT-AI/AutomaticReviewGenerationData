          [1] "Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen in a conventional flow reactor. Ethane and ethylene (C, compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion of CHI over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 OC."

[2] "EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li'O-] centers probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH4."

[3] "Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO2, are produced via CH3.; the coupling of two CH3. leads to C2H6, which is partly oxidized to C2H4."

[4] "The Li-promoted MgO contains no transition metals; thus it is a new type of oxidation catalyst on which thermally generated 0- ions activate methane."

[5] "Below 700 "C CO and CO2 are produced by reactions of CH3. with either surface O2- ions or gaseous O2. The latter reaction leads to chain reactions in which additional methyl radicals are generated."

[6] "One cannot exclude the additional formation of methyl radicals through branching gas-phase chain reactions."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves a complex interplay between catalysts, reaction conditions, and mechanisms. The study focuses on lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as a novel catalyst for methane oxidation, achieving high selectivity and conversion rates for C2 compounds.

Key aspects of the ODH process using Li/MgO catalysts include:

1. Catalyst composition: Li/MgO is a new type of oxidation catalyst without transition metals, relying on thermally generated O- ions to activate methane.

2. Active sites: [Li'O-] centers are responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting hydrogen from methane.

3. Selectivity and conversion: 50% selectivity for C2 compounds (ethane and ethylene) at 38% methane conversion was achieved at 720°C.

4. Reaction mechanism:
   a. C-H bond activation by [Li'O-] centers to form methyl radicals (CH3.)
   b. Coupling of methyl radicals to form ethane (C2H6)
   c. Partial oxidation of ethane to ethylene (C2H4)
   d. Formation of CO and CO2 via reactions of CH3. with surface O2- ions or gaseous O2

5. Temperature effects: Both selectivity and conversion increase with temperature up to about 700°C. Above this temperature, over-oxidation becomes more significant.

6. Challenges:
   a. Competing reactions producing CO and CO2
   b. Gas-phase chain reactions generating additional methyl radicals

7. Site isolation: The Li/MgO system provides isolated active sites, which helps improve selectivity by limiting over-oxidation.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by catalyst composition, temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and surface area. The Li/MgO catalyst system demonstrates how careful design can address selectivity issues in ODH reactions, offering a promising approach for the selective conversion of methane to higher-value hydrocarbons. However, challenges remain in controlling competing oxidation pathways and gas-phase reactions.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及催化剂、反应条件和机理之间的复杂相互作用。这项研究聚焦于锂促进的氧化镁（Li/MgO）作为一种新型甲烷氧化催化剂，实现了C2化合物的高选择性和转化率。

使用Li/MgO催化剂的ODH过程的关键方面包括：

1. 催化剂组成：Li/MgO是一种不含过渡金属的新型氧化催化剂，依靠热生成的O-离子来活化甲烷。

2. 活性位点：[Li'O-]中心负责通过从甲烷中提取氢来启动反应。

3. 选择性和转化率：在720°C下，C2化合物（乙烷和乙烯）的选择性达到50%，甲烷转化率为38%。

4. 反应机理：
   a. [Li'O-]中心活化C-H键形成甲基自由基（CH3.）
   b. 甲基自由基偶联形成乙烷（C2H6）
   c. 乙烷部分氧化成乙烯（C2H4）
   d. CH3.与表面O2-离子或气相O2反应形成CO和CO2

5. 温度效应：选择性和转化率都随温度升高而增加，直到约700°C。超过这个温度，过度氧化变得更加显著。

6. 挑战：
   a. 产生CO和CO2的竞争反应
   b. 产生额外甲基自由基的气相链式反应

7. 位点隔离：Li/MgO系统提供了孤立的活性位点，有助于通过限制过度氧化来提高选择性。

过程效率受催化剂组成、温度、氧分压和表面积的影响。Li/MgO催化剂系统展示了如何通过精心设计来解决ODH反应中的选择性问题，为甲烷选择性转化为高价值烃类提供了一种有前景的方法。然而，控制竞争性氧化途径和气相反应仍然存在挑战。
