          "Oxidation reactions are structure sensitive and therefore greatly depend on the local and surface structure of the oxide catalysts. A peculiar fitting between stereochemistry of the solid surface and of the reactant molecule(s) is to be obtained to get the best catalyst."

"Usually monomeric species as MoO42- or VO43- exhibit acidic feature and then total oxidation properties. At variance low size polymeric species exhibit better selectivity for many partial oxidation reactions than large size species or bulk-type oxide."

"Active sites for oxidation reactions appear to be molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms whose size greatly influences the catalytic properties."

"Oxidation catalysts have to be considered with a dynamic view under reaction conditions. This is related to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism and also to the mobility of the oxide lattice."

"According to this mechanism the substrate is oxidized by the solid and not directly by molecular oxygen of the gaseous phase. The rôle of dioxygen is to regenerate or maintain the oxidized state of the catalyst."

"The homolytic fragmentation of a C-H bond in the coordination sphere of the acceptor metal ion may occur via a transfer of the hydrogen to the oxygen ion at -2 oxidation state. This is a concerted action with homolytic breaking of metal-oxygen bond which transfers one electron to the metal."

"Case (a) (nucleophilic character) will intervene in activation of a C-H bond in o of the double bond or of aromatic ring."

"It clearly appears that a single and isolated metallic ion site cannot take into account all the necessary transformations involved in the reaction since several steps as replenishing of oxygen anion vacancies, H atoms extraction and electrons transfer are concerned."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. The interplay between bulk metal oxides and supported systems is crucial in determining catalytic performance.

Key aspects of ODH catalysis include:

1. Catalyst Structure: ODH reactions are structure-sensitive, depending heavily on the local and surface structure of oxide catalysts. The size and composition of active sites, described as "molecular 'inorganic ensembles' of metallic oxide atoms", greatly influence catalytic properties.

2. Site Isolation: This concept is crucial for improving selectivity. Low-size polymeric species often exhibit better selectivity for partial oxidation reactions compared to larger species or bulk oxides. Monomeric species like MoO42- or VO43- tend to promote total oxidation.

3. Reaction Mechanism: ODH typically follows the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, where the substrate is oxidized by the solid catalyst rather than directly by gaseous oxygen. The process involves several steps:
   a) C-H bond activation: Often through nucleophilic attack by the catalyst's oxygen on C-H bonds.
   b) M-alkyl intermediate formation: After C-H bond activation.
   c) 2H-abstraction: Removal of hydrogen to form the alkene product.

4. Dynamic Nature: Catalysts must be considered dynamically under reaction conditions, with the oxide lattice showing mobility.

5. Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is a major challenge, primarily due to the tendency of alkanes to undergo complete oxidation.

6. Active Site Complexity: Single, isolated metallic ion sites are insufficient for the complex transformations in ODH. Multiple steps including oxygen vacancy replenishment, hydrogen atom extraction, and electron transfer require more complex active site structures.

The efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by these factors. Optimizing catalyst design requires balancing various aspects to achieve both high selectivity and conversion while minimizing over-oxidation.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受催化剂组成和结构等多种因素影响的复杂过程。体相金属氧化物和负载系统之间的相互作用对决定催化性能至关重要。

ODH催化的关键方面包括：

1. 催化剂结构：ODH反应对结构敏感，极大地依赖于氧化物催化剂的局部和表面结构。被描述为"金属氧化物原子的分子'无机集合体'"的活性位点的大小和组成极大地影响了催化性能。

2. 位点隔离：这个概念对提高选择性至关重要。与大型物种或体相氧化物相比，小型聚合物种通常对部分氧化反应表现出更好的选择性。像MoO42-或VO43-这样的单体物种倾向于促进完全氧化。

3. 反应机理：ODH通常遵循Mars和van Krevelen机理，其中底物被固体催化剂氧化，而不是直接被气相氧氧化。该过程包括几个步骤：
   a) C-H键活化：通常通过催化剂氧对C-H键的亲核攻击实现。
   b) M-烷基中间体形成：C-H键活化后形成。
   c) 2H-抽提：移除氢以形成烯烃产物。

4. 动态特性：必须在反应条件下动态地考虑催化剂，氧化物晶格表现出移动性。

5. 挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个主要挑战，主要是由于烷烃倾向于完全氧化。

6. 活性位点复杂性：单一、孤立的金属离子位点不足以进行ODH中的复杂转化。包括氧空位补充、氢原子提取和电子转移在内的多个步骤需要更复杂的活性位点结构。

ODH过程的效率受这些因素的集体影响。优化催化剂设计需要平衡各种方面，以实现高选择性和高转化率，同时最小化过度氧化。
