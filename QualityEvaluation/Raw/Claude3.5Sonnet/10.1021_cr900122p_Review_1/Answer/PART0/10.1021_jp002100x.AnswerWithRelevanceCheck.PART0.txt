          [1] "Kinetic analysis and isotopic tracer studies were used to identify the elementary steps and their reversibility in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts."

[2] "Propene is the primary product and carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts via propane and propene combustion."

[3] "These data indicate that the kinetically relevant steps in propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion involve the dissociation of CH bonds in the respective reactant."

[4] "These isotopic tracer results are consistent with a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism in which two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of C–H bond in propane."

[5] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as propene, and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced Mo centers."

[6] "Propane ODH turnover rate are widely different on MoO3 and ZrMo2O8 because of apparent differences in the strength and accessibility of active MoO bonds."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, particularly propane, involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms. The study focuses on ZrO2-supported MoOx catalysts, as well as bulk MoO3 and ZrMo2O8.

Key aspects of the ODH process include:

1. Catalysts: The research compares supported systems (MoOx/ZrO2) with bulk metal oxides (MoO3 and ZrMo2O8). Catalyst composition and structure significantly influence reactivity, with differences in turnover rates attributed to variations in the strength and accessibility of active MoO bonds.

2. Selectivity and conversion challenges: The main challenge is achieving high selectivity to propene while maintaining high conversion. Propene is the desired primary product, but carbon oxides (COx) form as byproducts through both propane and propene combustion.

3. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle:
   a. C-H bond activation: Two lattice oxygen atoms participate in the irreversible activation of C-H bonds in propane.
   b. Alkyl intermediate formation: The resulting alkyl species form on the catalyst surface.
   c. Product desorption: Alkyl species desorb as propene.
   d. Catalyst regeneration: Remaining OH groups recombine to form water and reduced Mo centers, which are then reoxidized by O2 chemisorption.

4. Kinetic relevance: Isotopic studies indicate that C-H bond dissociation is the kinetically relevant step in both propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion.

5. Process efficiency: Efficiency is influenced by:
   a. The rate of propene formation vs. combustion reactions
   b. The catalyst's ability to selectively activate C-H bonds
   c. The rate of catalyst reoxidation by O2

While not explicitly discussed in the given quotes, site isolation can play a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by potentially limiting over-oxidation reactions that lead to COx formation.

The study employs isotopic tracer methods and kinetic analysis to elucidate the reaction mechanism, providing valuable insights into the elementary steps and their reversibility. This understanding is crucial for optimizing the ODH process and developing more effective catalysts for alkane activation.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，特别是丙烷的ODH，涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用。该研究主要关注ZrO2负载的MoOx催化剂，以及块状MoO3和ZrMo2O8。

ODH过程的关键方面包括：

1. 催化剂：研究比较了负载型系统（MoOx/ZrO2）和块状金属氧化物（MoO3和ZrMo2O8）。催化剂的组成和结构显著影响反应活性，转化频率的差异归因于活性MoO键强度和可及性的变化。

2. 选择性和转化率挑战：主要挑战是在保持高转化率的同时实现对丙烯的高选择性。丙烯是所需的主要产物，但碳氧化物（COx）通过丙烷和丙烯的燃烧作为副产物形成。

3. 反应机理：提出的机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环：
   a. C-H键活化：两个晶格氧原子参与丙烷C-H键的不可逆活化。
   b. 烷基中间体形成：在催化剂表面形成烷基物种。
   c. 产物脱附：烷基物种作为丙烯脱附。
   d. 催化剂再生：剩余的OH基团重新结合形成水和还原的Mo中心，然后通过O2化学吸附再氧化。

4. 动力学相关性：同位素研究表明，C-H键断裂是丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的动力学相关步骤。

5. 过程效率：效率受以下因素影响：
   a. 丙烯形成速率与燃烧反应速率的比较
   b. 催化剂选择性活化C-H键的能力
   c. 催化剂被O2再氧化的速率

虽然在给出的引用中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离可以在解决选择性问题方面发挥关键作用，通过潜在地限制导致COx形成的过度氧化反应。

该研究采用同位素示踪方法和动力学分析来阐明反应机理，为了解基元步骤及其可逆性提供了宝贵的见解。这种理解对于优化ODH过程和开发更有效的烷烃活化催化剂至关重要。
