[1] "When methane was passed over MgO at temperatures of approximately 500 °C, methyl radicals were produced on the surface, released into the gas phase, and trapped downstream in a solid argon matrix where they were analyzed by EPR spectroscopy."

[2] "Two pathways are believed to be responsible for the radical formation. Over pure MgO, intrinsic cation vacancies react with molecular oxygen to give an O- center which can abstract a hydrogen atom from methane to produce the methyl radical. For the lithium-doped samples, substitutional Li+ ions react with molecular oxygen to form a [Li+O-] center which is also capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from methane."

[3] "The apparent activation energy for this reaction was determined, over the temperature range of 500 to 550 °C, to be 42 ± 6 kcal mol-1."

[4] "The distribution of stable products (Table III) indicates that the primary reaction is the coupling of methyl radicals to form ethane."

[5] "The methanol probably is formed via a mechanism involving surface methoxide ions, which are then converted to methanol upon reacting with water in the system."

The literature does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) or the specific catalysts, challenges, and mechanisms mentioned in the question. However, it does discuss some related concepts in the context of methane activation over MgO catalysts:

The study focuses on the formation of methyl radicals from methane over MgO catalysts at high temperatures (around 500°C). Two main pathways are proposed for radical formation: 

1) On pure MgO, cation vacancies react with O2 to form O- centers that abstract hydrogen from methane.
2) On Li-doped MgO, Li+ ions react with O2 to form [Li+O-] centers that can also abstract hydrogen.

The process has a high activation energy of 42 ± 6 kcal/mol. The primary product is ethane, formed by coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals. Some methanol is also produced, likely via surface methoxide intermediates.

While this system differs from typical ODH catalysts, it demonstrates similar concepts of C-H activation, the importance of oxygen species, and the challenge of controlling selectivity (with coupling being favored over partial oxidation). The role of defect sites (vacancies, dopants) in creating active centers is also highlighted, which relates to the concept of site isolation in ODH catalysts.

The study does not directly address strategies for improving selectivity or conversion, nor does it compare bulk and supported catalysts. However, the insights into reaction mechanisms and active sites could potentially inform the design of more effective ODH catalysts.

文献并未直接讨论烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)或问题中提到的特定催化剂、挑战和机制。但是，它确实在MgO催化剂上甲烷活化的背景下讨论了一些相关概念：

该研究重点关注在高温下（约500°C）MgO催化剂上甲烷形成甲基自由基。提出了两种主要的自由基形成途径：

1) 在纯MgO上，阳离子空位与O2反应形成O-中心，从甲烷中抽取氢。
2) 在掺锂的MgO上，Li+离子与O2反应形成[Li+O-]中心，也能抽取氢。

该过程具有42 ± 6 kcal/mol的高活化能。主要产物是乙烷，由气相甲基自由基偶联形成。也产生一些甲醇，可能是通过表面甲氧基中间体形成的。

虽然这个系统与典型的ODH催化剂不同，但它展示了类似的C-H活化概念、氧物种的重要性，以及控制选择性的挑战（偶联反应优于部分氧化）。缺陷位点（空位、掺杂剂）在创造活性中心方面的作用也被强调，这与ODH催化剂中的位点隔离概念相关。

该研究并未直接讨论提高选择性或转化率的策略，也没有比较块状和负载型催化剂。然而，对反应机理和活性位点的见解可能有助于设计更有效的ODH催化剂。
