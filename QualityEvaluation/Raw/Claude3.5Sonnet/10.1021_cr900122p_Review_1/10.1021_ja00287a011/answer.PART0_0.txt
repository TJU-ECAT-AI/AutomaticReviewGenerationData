[1] "When methane was passed over MgO at temperatures of approximately 500 °C, methyl radicals were produced on the surface, released into the gas phase, and trapped downstream in a solid argon matrix where they were analyzed by EPR spectroscopy."

[2] "Two pathways are believed to be responsible for the radical formation. Over pure MgO, intrinsic cation vacancies react with molecular oxygen to give an O- center which can abstract a hydrogen atom from methane to produce the methyl radical. For the lithium-doped samples, substitutional Li+ ions react with molecular oxygen to form a [Li+O-] center which is also capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from methane."

[3] "The apparent activation energy for this reaction was determined, over the temperature range of 500 to 550 °C, to be 42 ± 6 kcal mol-1."

[4] "The dominant product was ethane, which probably results from the coupling of methyl radicals. Oxygen was much less selective than nitrous oxide. With N2O as the oxidant a modest amount of methanol was also formed."

The literature does not directly discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) or the specific aspects mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some relevant information about methane activation over MgO catalysts, which can be related to ODH processes:

The study focuses on the formation of methyl radicals from methane over MgO catalysts at high temperatures (around 500°C). Two pathways for radical formation are proposed: one involving intrinsic cation vacancies in pure MgO, and another involving lithium-doped MgO with [Li+O-] centers. Both pathways involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from methane by an O- center.

The process has a high activation energy of 42 ± 6 kcal mol-1, indicating that it requires significant energy input. This is consistent with the challenges often encountered in ODH processes.

In terms of product selectivity, the main product observed was ethane, likely formed by the coupling of methyl radicals. This suggests that achieving high selectivity to desired products (such as olefins in ODH) can be challenging. The use of different oxidants (oxygen vs. nitrous oxide) affected the product distribution, with N2O leading to some methanol formation.

While the study doesn't directly address site isolation, the difference in activity between pure and lithium-doped MgO suggests that the nature and distribution of active sites play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance.

Overall, while this study focuses on methane activation rather than ODH of higher alkanes, it illustrates some of the key challenges in selective oxidation processes, including the need for high temperatures, the importance of the nature of active sites, and the difficulty in controlling selectivity when radical processes are involved.

虽然这篇文献并未直接讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)或问题中提到的具体方面，但它确实提供了一些关于甲烷在MgO催化剂上活化的相关信息，这些信息可以与ODH过程联系起来：

该研究集中于在高温(约500°C)下MgO催化剂上甲烷形成甲基自由基的过程。提出了两种自由基形成途径：一种涉及纯MgO中的本征阳离子空位，另一种涉及锂掺杂的MgO中的[Li+O-]中心。两种途径都涉及O-中心从甲烷中提取氢原子。

该过程具有42 ± 6 kcal mol-1的高活化能，表明需要大量的能量输入。这与ODH过程中经常遇到的挑战是一致的。

在产品选择性方面，观察到的主要产品是乙烷，可能是由甲基自由基偶联形成的。这表明要实现对所需产品（如ODH中的烯烃）的高选择性可能具有挑战性。使用不同的氧化剂（氧气vs一氧化二氮）影响了产品分布，N2O导致了一些甲醇的形成。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及位点隔离，但纯MgO和锂掺杂MgO之间的活性差异表明，活性位点的性质和分布在决定催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。

总的来说，虽然这项研究侧重于甲烷活化而非高级烷烃的ODH，但它说明了选择性氧化过程中的一些关键挑战，包括需要高温、活性位点性质的重要性，以及当涉及自由基过程时控制选择性的难度。
