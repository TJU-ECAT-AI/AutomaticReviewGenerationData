[1] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures and does not suffer from the detrimental effects of coking"

[2] "However, this selective oxidation is difficult to achieve due to the tendency of propylene to overoxidize to CO and CO2 under the reaction conditions."

[5] "Kinetic analyses of the propane ODH reactions at 606 K showed that the value of k1 (the rate of propane ODH; L mol−1 s−1) was three times greater for the TMP-derived catalysts than for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by wet impregnation"

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors:

1. Catalysts: Vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH. Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with the best performance observed for materials containing 10-18% vanadia.

2. Challenges: The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The tendency of propylene to overoxidize to CO and CO2 under reaction conditions makes selective oxidation difficult.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The process involves C-H bond activation, potentially forming M-alkyl intermediates, followed by 2H-abstraction. The specific mechanisms can vary depending on the catalyst used.

4. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, reaction temperature, and kinetics. TMP-derived catalysts have shown three times higher rates of propane ODH compared to wet impregnation catalysts.

5. Site isolation: This plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated active sites can help prevent overoxidation of the desired product. The development of catalysts with lower activity for propylene oxidation (low k3 values) is key to improving ODH catalysis.

6. Temperature effects: ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation, which helps avoid coking issues.

Overall, the development of highly selective and active catalysts for ODH requires careful consideration of catalyst composition, preparation method, and reaction conditions to optimize the balance between alkane activation and product selectivity.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

1. 催化剂：钒基催化剂通常在丙烷ODH中的表现优于其他金属含量的催化剂。使用了体相金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中含10-18%钒氧化物的材料表现最佳。

2. 挑战：ODH的主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。在反应条件下，丙烯容易过度氧化成CO和CO2，这使得选择性氧化变得困难。

3. 反应机理：该过程涉及C-H键活化，可能形成M-烷基中间体，然后进行2H-抽提。具体机理可能因所用催化剂而异。

4. 过程效率：效率受催化剂组成、反应温度和动力学的相互作用影响。TMP衍生的催化剂显示出比湿法浸渍催化剂高三倍的丙烷ODH速率。

5. 位点隔离：这在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。隔离的活性位点可以帮助防止目标产物的过度氧化。开发对丙烯氧化活性较低（k3值低）的催化剂是改进ODH催化的关键。

6. 温度效应：与非氧化脱氢相比，ODH在较低温度下在热力学上更有利，这有助于避免结焦问题。

总的来说，开发高选择性和高活性的ODH催化剂需要仔细考虑催化剂组成、制备方法和反应条件，以优化烷烃活化和产物选择性之间的平衡。
