[1] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures and does not suffer from the detrimental effects of coking"

[2] "However, this selective oxidation is difficult to achieve due to the tendency of propylene to overoxidize to CO and CO2 under the reaction conditions."

[3] "Recent reviews and reports on this subject have suggested that vanadium-based catalysts generally outperform other metal-containing catalysts for propane ODH"

[4] "The TMP synthetic route offered the potential to produce catalysts with high surface areas and homogeneities relative to catalysts that were known for propane ODH. It was also hoped that use of this method might provide more controlled transformations to well-defined materials with high surface densities of the desired catalytic sites."

[5] "The improved properties observed for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by the TMP cothermolysis method may be at least partially attributed to higher surface areas and improved dispersions of VOx species relative to those in catalysts prepared by conventional means."

[6] "The TMP route also appears to give a more controlled and complete conversion of vanadium species to catalytically active oligomeric VOx species."

[7] "Kinetic analyses of the propane ODH reactions at 606 K showed that the value of k1 (the rate of propane ODH; L mol1 s1) was three times greater for the TMP-derived catalysts than for V/Zr/O catalysts obtained by wet impregnation"

[8] "However, the k3 values (the rate constants for propylene combustion; L mol1 s1) were similar for the two types of catalysts. The latter result is significant, in that dramatic improvements in propane ODH catalysis appear to hinge on development of catalysts with a much lower activity for propylene oxidation (low values of k3)"

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising alternative to traditional dehydrogenation processes, as it operates at lower temperatures and avoids coking issues. However, achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a significant challenge in ODH reactions, primarily due to the tendency of the desired olefin products to overoxidize to CO and CO2.

Vanadium-based catalysts have emerged as the most effective for propane ODH among metal-containing catalysts. The thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method has shown potential in producing catalysts with improved properties, including higher surface areas, better homogeneity, and increased surface density of active sites compared to conventional preparation methods.

V/Zr/O catalysts prepared by the TMP cothermolysis method have demonstrated superior performance, attributed to higher surface areas and improved dispersions of VOx species. The TMP route provides more controlled and complete conversion of vanadium species to catalytically active oligomeric VOx species.

Kinetic analyses reveal that TMP-derived catalysts exhibit a propane ODH rate three times higher than those obtained by wet impregnation. However, the rate of propylene combustion remains similar for both catalyst types, indicating that further improvements in ODH catalysis depend on developing catalysts with lower activity for propylene oxidation.

The interplay between catalyst composition, preparation method, and reaction conditions significantly influences the efficiency of the ODH process. Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by minimizing the overoxidation of desired products. The TMP method offers better control over the catalyst structure at the atomic level, potentially leading to more selective and active catalysts for ODH reactions.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss reaction mechanisms such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction, the emphasis on developing catalysts with lower propylene oxidation activity suggests that controlling these mechanistic steps is key to improving ODH performance. Further research into the precise nature of active sites and reaction pathways could lead to the design of more efficient and selective ODH catalysts.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是传统脱氢工艺的一个有前景的替代方案，因为它在较低温度下运行并避免了结焦问题。然而，在ODH反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是一个重大挑战，主要是由于所需的烯烃产物容易过度氧化成CO和CO2。

在含金属催化剂中，钒基催化剂已被证明是丙烷ODH最有效的催化剂。热解分子前驱体（TMP）方法显示出生产性能更好的催化剂的潜力，包括与传统制备方法相比，具有更高的比表面积、更好的均匀性和更高的活性位点表面密度。

通过TMP共热解法制备的V/Zr/O催化剂表现出优异的性能，这归因于更高的比表面积和VOx物种的改进分散。TMP路线提供了更受控制和更完整的钒物种向催化活性的寡聚VOx物种的转化。

动力学分析表明，TMP衍生的催化剂的丙烷ODH速率是湿法浸渍法获得的催化剂的三倍。然而，两种类型催化剂的丙烯燃烧速率仍然相似，这表明ODH催化进一步改进取决于开发对丙烯氧化活性较低的催化剂。

催化剂组成、制备方法和反应条件之间的相互作用显著影响ODH过程的效率。位点隔离通过最小化所需产物的过度氧化在解决选择性问题方面起着关键作用。TMP方法可以更好地控制原子级别的催化剂结构，有可能导致更具选择性和活性的ODH反应催化剂。

虽然文献没有明确讨论反应机理，如C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提，但强调开发丙烯氧化活性较低的催化剂表明，控制这些机理步骤是提高ODH性能的关键。对活性位点和反应途径精确本质的进一步研究可能导致设计出更高效和选择性的ODH催化剂。
