[1] "The dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated at 500 C by in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopyon-line activity measurements as a function of the reaction time (060 min), the support composition (SiO2 : Al2O3 ratio) and the Cr loading (08 wt.%)."

[2] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and CO/CO2 and cracking products (C1, C2 and C3) are formed. After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene are produced with a selectivity up to 90%."

[3] "A relation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon the reduction of Cr6 has been established."

[4] "The almost linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, as measured by in situ DRS spectroscopy, indicates that Cr3 is the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation"

The literature provided does not directly discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) or the specific aspects mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some relevant insights into the dehydrogenation of n-butane using supported chromium oxide catalysts, which can be related to the broader topic of alkane dehydrogenation.

The study focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation rather than ODH. It examines supported chromium oxide catalysts, investigating the effects of reaction time, support composition, and chromium loading on the dehydrogenation of n-butane.

The process efficiency is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst reduction: There is an initial induction period where Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+. This reduction is crucial for the catalyst's activity.

2. Product selectivity: After the induction period, the selectivity towards the desired products (but-1-ene and but-2-ene) reaches up to 90%.

3. Catalyst composition: The support material (SiO2:Al2O3 ratio) and chromium loading affect the catalyst's performance.

4. Active species: Cr3+ is identified as the likely active species for n-butane dehydrogenation, with a linear relationship observed between Cr3+ formation and catalytic activity.

The study does not directly address site isolation or specific reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation or M-alkyl intermediates. However, the high selectivity achieved (90%) suggests that the supported chromium catalyst system effectively manages selectivity issues.

While this study doesn't cover all aspects of the question, it provides valuable insights into non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation, which can inform broader discussions on catalytic dehydrogenation processes, including ODH.

提供的文献并未直接讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）或问题中提到的具体方面。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用负载型氧化铬催化剂进行正丁烷脱氢的相关见解，这可以与更广泛的烷烃脱氢主题相关联。

这项研究侧重于非氧化脱氢而不是ODH。它研究了负载型氧化铬催化剂，考察了反应时间、载体组成和铬负载量对正丁烷脱氢的影响。

过程效率受几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂还原：存在一个初始诱导期，其中Cr6+被还原为Cr3+/Cr2+。这种还原对催化剂的活性至关重要。

2. 产品选择性：在诱导期之后，对目标产物（1-丁烯和2-丁烯）的选择性可达90%。

3. 催化剂组成：载体材料（SiO2:Al2O3比率）和铬负载量影响催化剂的性能。

4. 活性物种：Cr3+被确定为可能的正丁烷脱氢活性物种，观察到Cr3+形成与催化活性之间存在线性关系。

这项研究没有直接涉及位点隔离或特定的反应机制，如C-H键活化或金属-烷基中间体。然而，所获得的高选择性（90%）表明，负载型铬催化剂系统有效地管理了选择性问题。

虽然这项研究没有涵盖问题的所有方面，但它为非氧化烷烃脱氢提供了宝贵的见解，这可以为更广泛的催化脱氢过程（包括ODH）的讨论提供信息。

4. Process efficiency: Maximal conversion was reached after 5-15 minutes on-stream. Deactivation occurred due to coke formation.

5. Site isolation: The study does not directly address site isolation, but the support composition's influence on catalytic activity suggests that the dispersion and nature of Cr sites play a role in the catalyst's performance.

While this study provides valuable insights into n-butane dehydrogenation, it does not cover all aspects of ODH or the specific mechanisms mentioned in the question.

The document does not specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), but rather focuses on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from this study that are relevant to the question:

1. Catalyst composition and support: The study shows that catalytic activity increases with increasing Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support. This demonstrates the importance of both the active metal and the support material in influencing catalyst performance.

2. Selectivity and conversion: The catalysts achieved high selectivity (up to 90%) towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene after an initial induction period. However, the conversions were relatively low, indicating a challenge in achieving both high selectivity and high conversion simultaneously.

3. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that Cr3+ species, formed upon the reduction of Cr6+, are the active sites for n-butane dehydrogenation. This provides insight into the importance of the oxidation state of the active metal in the dehydrogenation process.

4. Process efficiency: The catalytic activity reached a maximum after 5-15 minutes on stream, followed by a gradual decrease due to coke formation. This highlights the challenge of catalyst deactivation in maintaining process efficiency over time.

While the study does not directly address site isolation or discuss ODH mechanisms such as C-H bond activation or M-alkyl intermediates, it does demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and performance in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These insights can be valuable for understanding and optimizing related processes like ODH.

该文档并未具体讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），而是主要关注负载型氧化铬催化剂上正丁烷的非氧化脱氢。然而，从这项研究中可以得出一些与问题相关的见解：

1. 催化剂组成和载体：研究表明，随着Cr含量和载体中Al2O3含量的增加，催化活性也随之增加。这表明活性金属和载体材料对催化剂性能的影响都很重要。

2. 选择性和转化率：催化剂在初始诱导期后对1-丁烯和2-丁烯达到了高选择性（高达90%）。然而，转化率相对较低，这表明同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个挑战。

3. 反应机理：研究表明，由Cr6+还原形成的Cr3+物种是正丁烷脱氢的活性位点。这为理解脱氢过程中活性金属氧化态的重要性提供了洞见。

4. 过程效率：催化活性在反应开始后5-15分钟达到最大值，之后由于积碳而逐渐降低。这突显了在长期维持过程效率方面催化剂失活的挑战。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及位点隔离或讨论ODH机理（如C-H键活化或M-烷基中间体），但它确实展示了烷烃脱氢反应中催化剂组成、反应条件和性能之间的复杂相互作用。这些见解对于理解和优化相关过程（如ODH）可能具有价值。

The literature provided does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). Instead, it focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts. However, we can use the information provided to discuss some aspects of alkane dehydrogenation in general:

1. Catalysts: The study uses supported chromium oxide catalysts, with varying support compositions (SiO2:Al2O3 ratio) and Cr loadings (0-8 wt.%).

2. Selectivity and conversion: The selectivity towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene reached up to 90% after an initial induction period. The conversion was not explicitly stated but was mentioned to increase with Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support.

3. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ during the reaction, and Cr3+ is likely the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation. The initial reduction of Cr6+ leads to the formation of CO/CO2 and cracking products.

4. Process efficiency: The catalytic activity reached a maximum after 5-15 minutes on stream, indicating an optimal reaction time. The activity increased with Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support.

5. Site isolation: The study does not directly address site isolation. However, the use of supported catalysts with varying Cr loadings suggests that the distribution of Cr sites on the support may play a role in catalyst performance.

While this study does not cover ODH or explicitly discuss C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction, it provides insights into the behavior of chromium-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The findings regarding the active Cr species and the influence of support composition could be relevant to the development of more efficient catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
