[1] "The dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated at 500 C by in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopyon-line activity measurements as a function of the reaction time (060 min), the support composition (SiO2 : Al2O3 ratio) and the Cr loading (08 wt.%)."

[2] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and CO/CO2 and cracking products (C1, C2 and C3) are formed. After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene are produced with a selectivity up to 90%."

[3] "A relation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon the reduction of Cr6 has been established."

[4] "The almost linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, as measured by in situ DRS spectroscopy, indicates that Cr3 is the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation"

The literature provided does not directly discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) or the specific aspects mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some relevant insights into the dehydrogenation of n-butane using supported chromium oxide catalysts, which can be related to the broader topic of alkane dehydrogenation.

The study focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation rather than ODH. It examines supported chromium oxide catalysts, investigating the effects of reaction time, support composition, and chromium loading on the dehydrogenation of n-butane.

The process efficiency is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst reduction: There is an initial induction period where Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+. This reduction is crucial for the catalyst's activity.

2. Product selectivity: After the induction period, the selectivity towards the desired products (but-1-ene and but-2-ene) reaches up to 90%.

3. Catalyst composition: The support material (SiO2:Al2O3 ratio) and chromium loading affect the catalyst's performance.

4. Active species: Cr3+ is identified as the likely active species for n-butane dehydrogenation, with a linear relationship observed between Cr3+ formation and catalytic activity.

The study does not directly address site isolation or specific reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation or M-alkyl intermediates. However, the high selectivity achieved (90%) suggests that the supported chromium catalyst system effectively manages selectivity issues.

While this study doesn't cover all aspects of the question, it provides valuable insights into non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation, which can inform broader discussions on catalytic dehydrogenation processes, including ODH.

提供的文献并未直接讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）或问题中提到的具体方面。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用负载型氧化铬催化剂进行正丁烷脱氢的相关见解，这可以与更广泛的烷烃脱氢主题相关联。

这项研究侧重于非氧化脱氢而不是ODH。它研究了负载型氧化铬催化剂，考察了反应时间、载体组成和铬负载量对正丁烷脱氢的影响。

过程效率受几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂还原：存在一个初始诱导期，其中Cr6+被还原为Cr3+/Cr2+。这种还原对催化剂的活性至关重要。

2. 产品选择性：在诱导期之后，对目标产物（1-丁烯和2-丁烯）的选择性可达90%。

3. 催化剂组成：载体材料（SiO2:Al2O3比率）和铬负载量影响催化剂的性能。

4. 活性物种：Cr3+被确定为可能的正丁烷脱氢活性物种，观察到Cr3+形成与催化活性之间存在线性关系。

这项研究没有直接涉及位点隔离或特定的反应机制，如C-H键活化或金属-烷基中间体。然而，所获得的高选择性（90%）表明，负载型铬催化剂系统有效地管理了选择性问题。

虽然这项研究没有涵盖问题的所有方面，但它为非氧化烷烃脱氢提供了宝贵的见解，这可以为更广泛的催化脱氢过程（包括ODH）的讨论提供信息。
