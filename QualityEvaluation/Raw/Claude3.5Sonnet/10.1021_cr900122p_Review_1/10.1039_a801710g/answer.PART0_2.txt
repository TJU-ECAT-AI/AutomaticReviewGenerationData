[1] "The dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated at 500 C by in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopyon-line activity measurements as a function of the reaction time (060 min), the support composition (SiO2 : Al2O3 ratio) and the Cr loading (08 wt.%)."

[2] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and CO/CO2 and cracking products (C1, C2 and C3) are formed. After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene are produced with a selectivity up to 90%."

[3] "The catalytic activity increases with increasing Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support, and is maximum after 515 min on stream. A relation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon the reduction of Cr6 has been established."

[4] "The almost linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, as measured by in situ DRS spectroscopy, indicates that Cr3 is the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation"

The document does not specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), but rather focuses on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from this study that are relevant to the question:

1. Catalyst composition and support: The study shows that catalytic activity increases with increasing Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support. This demonstrates the importance of both the active metal and the support material in influencing catalyst performance.

2. Selectivity and conversion: The catalysts achieved high selectivity (up to 90%) towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene after an initial induction period. However, the conversions were relatively low, indicating a challenge in achieving both high selectivity and high conversion simultaneously.

3. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that Cr3+ species, formed upon the reduction of Cr6+, are the active sites for n-butane dehydrogenation. This provides insight into the importance of the oxidation state of the active metal in the dehydrogenation process.

4. Process efficiency: The catalytic activity reached a maximum after 5-15 minutes on stream, followed by a gradual decrease due to coke formation. This highlights the challenge of catalyst deactivation in maintaining process efficiency over time.

While the study does not directly address site isolation or discuss ODH mechanisms such as C-H bond activation or M-alkyl intermediates, it does demonstrate the complex interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and performance in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These insights can be valuable for understanding and optimizing related processes like ODH.

该文档并未具体讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），而是主要关注负载型氧化铬催化剂上正丁烷的非氧化脱氢。然而，从这项研究中可以得出一些与问题相关的见解：

1. 催化剂组成和载体：研究表明，随着Cr含量和载体中Al2O3含量的增加，催化活性也随之增加。这表明活性金属和载体材料对催化剂性能的影响都很重要。

2. 选择性和转化率：催化剂在初始诱导期后对1-丁烯和2-丁烯达到了高选择性（高达90%）。然而，转化率相对较低，这表明同时实现高选择性和高转化率是一个挑战。

3. 反应机理：研究表明，由Cr6+还原形成的Cr3+物种是正丁烷脱氢的活性位点。这为理解脱氢过程中活性金属氧化态的重要性提供了洞见。

4. 过程效率：催化活性在反应开始后5-15分钟达到最大值，之后由于积碳而逐渐降低。这突显了在长期维持过程效率方面催化剂失活的挑战。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及位点隔离或讨论ODH机理（如C-H键活化或M-烷基中间体），但它确实展示了烷烃脱氢反应中催化剂组成、反应条件和性能之间的复杂相互作用。这些见解对于理解和优化相关过程（如ODH）可能具有价值。
