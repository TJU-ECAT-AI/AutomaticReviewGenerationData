[1] "The dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated at 500 C by in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopyon-line activity measurements as a function of the reaction time (060 min), the support composition (SiO2 : Al2O3 ratio) and the Cr loading (08 wt.%)."

[2] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and CO/CO2 and cracking products (C1, C2 and C3) are formed. After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene are produced with a selectivity up to 90%."

[3] "A relation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon the reduction of Cr6 has been established."

[4] "The dehydrogenation activity increased with increasing Cr content, and Al2O3 content of the support, and a maximal conversion was reached after 515 min on-stream. The selectivity towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene was ca. 90%, and deactivation of the catalysts was due to coke formation."

The literature does not directly discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) or address all aspects of the question. However, it does provide insights into the dehydrogenation of n-butane using supported chromium oxide catalysts, which can be related to some aspects of the question:

1. Catalysts: The study focuses on supported chromium oxide catalysts, varying the support composition (SiO2:Al2O3 ratio) and Cr loading (0-8 wt.%).

2. Selectivity and conversion: The catalysts achieved high selectivity (up to 90%) for but-1-ene and but-2-ene production. Conversion was affected by Cr content, Al2O3 content in the support, and reaction time.

3. Reaction mechanism: The process involves an initial induction period where Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+. Cr3+ species formed upon Cr6+ reduction are suggested to be the active sites for dehydrogenation.

4. Process efficiency: Maximal conversion was reached after 5-15 minutes on-stream. Deactivation occurred due to coke formation.

5. Site isolation: The study does not directly address site isolation, but the support composition's influence on catalytic activity suggests that the dispersion and nature of Cr sites play a role in the catalyst's performance.

While this study provides valuable insights into n-butane dehydrogenation, it does not cover all aspects of ODH or the specific mechanisms mentioned in the question. The research focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation and does not discuss C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction mechanisms in detail.

这篇文献并未直接讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)或回答问题的所有方面。然而，它确实提供了关于使用负载型氧化铬催化剂进行正丁烷脱氢的见解，这可以与问题的某些方面相关联：

1. 催化剂：研究集中在负载型氧化铬催化剂上，改变载体组成（SiO2:Al2O3比例）和Cr负载量（0-8 wt.%）。

2. 选择性和转化率：催化剂对1-丁烯和2-丁烯的生产达到了高选择性（高达90%）。转化率受Cr含量、载体中Al2O3含量和反应时间的影响。

3. 反应机理：该过程涉及一个初始诱导期，其中Cr6+被还原为Cr3+/Cr2+。由Cr6+还原形成的Cr3+物种被认为是脱氢的活性位点。

4. 过程效率：在反应5-15分钟后达到最大转化率。由于积碳的形成导致失活。

5. 位点隔离：该研究没有直接涉及位点隔离，但载体组成对催化活性的影响表明Cr位点的分散和性质在催化剂性能中起着作用。

虽然这项研究为正丁烷脱氢提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未涵盖ODH的所有方面或问题中提到的特定机制。该研究集中在非氧化脱氢上，并未详细讨论C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提机制。
