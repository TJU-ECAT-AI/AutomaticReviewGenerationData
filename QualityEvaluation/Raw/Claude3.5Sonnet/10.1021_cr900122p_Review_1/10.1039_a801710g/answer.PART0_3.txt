[1] "The dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated at 500 C by in situ UVVIS diuse reectance spectroscopyon-line activity measurements as a function of the reaction time (060 min), the support composition (SiO2 : Al2O3 ratio) and the Cr loading (08 wt.%)."

[2] "The catalytic reaction is characterized by an initial induction period, during which the supported chromium oxides are reduced to Cr3@2, and CO/CO2 and cracking products (C1, C2 and C3) are formed. After this initial induction period, but-1-ene and but-2-ene are produced with a selectivity up to 90%."

[3] "The catalytic activity increases with increasing Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support, and is maximum after 515 min on stream. A relation between the dehydrogenation activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon the reduction of Cr6 has been established."

[4] "The almost linear relationship between the catalytic activity and the amount of Cr3 formed upon Cr6 reduction, as measured by in situ DRS spectroscopy, indicates that Cr3 is the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation"

The literature provided does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). Instead, it focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over supported chromium oxide catalysts. However, we can use the information provided to discuss some aspects of alkane dehydrogenation in general:

1. Catalysts: The study uses supported chromium oxide catalysts, with varying support compositions (SiO2:Al2O3 ratio) and Cr loadings (0-8 wt.%).

2. Selectivity and conversion: The selectivity towards but-1-ene and but-2-ene reached up to 90% after an initial induction period. The conversion was not explicitly stated but was mentioned to increase with Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support.

3. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ during the reaction, and Cr3+ is likely the active species for n-butane dehydrogenation. The initial reduction of Cr6+ leads to the formation of CO/CO2 and cracking products.

4. Process efficiency: The catalytic activity reached a maximum after 5-15 minutes on stream, indicating an optimal reaction time. The activity increased with Cr content and Al2O3 content of the support.

5. Site isolation: The study does not directly address site isolation. However, the use of supported catalysts with varying Cr loadings suggests that the distribution of Cr sites on the support may play a role in catalyst performance.

While this study does not cover ODH or explicitly discuss C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction, it provides insights into the behavior of chromium-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The findings regarding the active Cr species and the influence of support composition could be relevant to the development of more efficient catalysts for both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

所提供的文献并未直接涉及烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）。相反，它主要关注了在负载型氧化铬催化剂上的正丁烷非氧化脱氢。然而，我们可以利用所提供的信息来讨论烷烃脱氢的一些一般性方面：

1. 催化剂：该研究使用了负载型氧化铬催化剂，具有不同的载体组成（SiO2:Al2O3比率）和Cr负载量（0-8 wt.%）。

2. 选择性和转化率：在初始诱导期之后，对1-丁烯和2-丁烯的选择性达到了90%。虽然没有明确说明转化率，但提到它随着Cr含量和载体中Al2O3含量的增加而增加。

3. 反应机理：研究表明，Cr6+在反应过程中被还原为Cr3+，而Cr3+可能是正丁烷脱氢的活性物种。Cr6+的初始还原导致了CO/CO2和裂解产物的形成。

4. 过程效率：催化活性在流动5-15分钟后达到最大值，表明存在最佳反应时间。活性随着Cr含量和载体中Al2O3含量的增加而增加。

5. 位点隔离：该研究没有直接涉及位点隔离。然而，使用不同Cr负载量的负载型催化剂表明，Cr位点在载体上的分布可能对催化剂性能起作用。

虽然这项研究没有涵盖ODH或明确讨论C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提，但它提供了有关铬基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中行为的见解。关于活性Cr物种和载体组成影响的发现可能与开发更高效的氧化和非氧化脱氢过程催化剂有关。
