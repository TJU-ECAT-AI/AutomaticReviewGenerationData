[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes. While nonoxidative dehydrogenation is endothermic and leads to the concurrent formation of carbon, which, in turn, deactivates the catalysts, ODH is exothermic by forming water as a byproduct and eliminating the coke formation, leading to stable catalysts."

[2] "Several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, and vanadium-based materials are among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are the other promising catalysts for ODH. Although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability."

[3] "It was concluded that ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts follow the same mechanism and that two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of the CH bonds in propane via a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism."

[4] "We predict that hydrogen abstraction by MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. We find that activating the methylene CH bond is 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond."

[5] "Our calculations suggest that a combined effect from both the methylene and the methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall kinetic isotopic effects from propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts."

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, offering advantages over non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The key factors influencing ODH efficiency include:

1. Catalysts: Various metal oxides have been studied, with vanadium-based and molybdenum-based catalysts showing promise. Mo-based catalysts, while less active, demonstrate higher propylene selectivity and better thermostability.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The process involves C-H bond activation, with hydrogen abstraction by metal oxide species being the most feasible pathway. Both methylene and methyl C-H bonds participate in the reaction, with methylene C-H bond activation being energetically favored.

3. Selectivity and conversion challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a challenge in ODH. The interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways affects these parameters.

4. Site isolation: While not explicitly discussed in the given quotes, site isolation likely plays a role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and accessibility of active sites on the catalyst surface.

5. Process efficiency: The efficiency is influenced by the exothermic nature of ODH, which forms water as a byproduct and eliminates coke formation, leading to stable catalysts. The choice of catalyst (e.g., V-based vs. Mo-based) affects activity and selectivity, impacting overall efficiency.

6. Kinetic isotope effects: Experimental observations of kinetic isotope effects suggest that both methylene and methyl C-H bond cleavages contribute to the overall reaction kinetics, particularly in MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts.

In summary, the ODH of alkanes involves a complex interplay of factors, including catalyst choice, reaction mechanisms, and site isolation, all of which collectively influence the process efficiency and selectivity. Ongoing research aims to optimize these factors to improve the overall performance of ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是生产烯烃的一种有吸引力的工艺，相比非氧化脱氢具有优势。影响ODH效率的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂：研究了各种金属氧化物，其中钒基和钼基催化剂表现出良好的前景。钼基催化剂虽然活性较低，但表现出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的热稳定性。

2. 反应机理：该过程涉及C-H键的活化，其中金属氧化物物种进行氢原子抽取是最可行的途径。甲基和亚甲基C-H键都参与反应，但亚甲基C-H键的活化在能量上更有利。

3. 选择性和转化率挑战：在ODH中同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是一个挑战。催化剂组成、反应条件和机理途径之间的相互作用影响着这些参数。

4. 位点隔离：虽然在给出的引文中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离可能通过控制催化剂表面活性位点的分布和可及性来解决选择性问题。

5. 工艺效率：效率受ODH放热性质的影响，它形成水作为副产物并消除焦炭形成，从而导致催化剂稳定。催化剂的选择（如V基与Mo基）影响活性和选择性，进而影响整体效率。

6. 动力学同位素效应：动力学同位素效应的实验观察表明，亚甲基和甲基C-H键的断裂都对整体反应动力学有贡献，特别是在MoOx/ZrO2催化剂中。

总之，烷烃的ODH涉及多个因素的复杂相互作用，包括催化剂选择、反应机理和位点隔离，这些因素共同影响工艺效率和选择性。持续的研究旨在优化这些因素，以提高ODH工艺的整体性能。
