[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes. While nonoxidative dehydrogenation is endothermic and leads to the concurrent formation of carbon, which, in turn, deactivates the catalysts, ODH is exothermic by forming water as a byproduct and eliminating the coke formation, leading to stable catalysts."

[2] "Several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, and vanadium-based materials are among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are the other promising catalysts for ODH. Although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability."

[3] "It was concluded that ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts follow the same mechanism and that two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of the CH bonds in propane via a Marsvan Krevelen redox mechanism."

[4] "We predict that hydrogen abstraction by MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. We find that activating the methylene CH bond is 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable than activating the methyl CH bond."

[5] "Our calculations suggest that a combined effect from both the methylene and the methyl CH bond cleavages leads to the experimentally observed overall kinetic isotopic effects from propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts."

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an attractive process for producing alkenes, offering advantages over non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The key factors influencing ODH efficiency include:

1. Catalyst choice: Various metal oxides have been studied, with vanadium-based and molybdenum-based catalysts showing promise. Mo-based catalysts, while less active, offer higher propylene selectivity and better thermostability.

2. Reaction mechanism: The process follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, involving two lattice oxygens in the activation of C-H bonds. Hydrogen abstraction by metal-oxygen (e.g., MoO) groups is identified as the most feasible pathway.

3. C-H bond activation: Calculations show that activating the methylene C-H bond is energetically more favorable than the methyl C-H bond. However, both bonds contribute to the overall kinetics, as evidenced by kinetic isotope effects.

4. Selectivity challenges: The interplay between methylene and methyl C-H bond activations influences the process selectivity. Site isolation, while not explicitly discussed in the given text, can play a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues by controlling the distribution and accessibility of active sites on the catalyst surface.

5. Process efficiency: The efficiency is collectively influenced by the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Mo-based catalysts, for instance, offer a trade-off between activity and selectivity/stability.

The study of various reaction pathways and their energetics provides insights into optimizing catalyst design and reaction conditions to enhance ODH efficiency. Understanding the contribution of different C-H bond activations to the overall kinetics is crucial for developing more selective and efficient ODH processes.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是生产烯烃的一种有吸引力的工艺，比非氧化脱氢具有优势。影响ODH效率的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂选择：研究了各种金属氧化物，其中钒基和钼基催化剂表现出良好的前景。钼基催化剂虽然活性较低，但提供了更高的丙烯选择性和更好的热稳定性。

2. 反应机理：该过程遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理，涉及两个晶格氧参与C-H键的活化。金属-氧（如MoO）基团的氢抽提被确定为最可行的途径。

3. C-H键活化：计算表明，活化亚甲基C-H键在能量上比甲基C-H键更有利。然而，两种键都对整体动力学有贡献，这从动力学同位素效应中可以看出。

4. 选择性挑战：亚甲基和甲基C-H键活化之间的相互作用影响过程的选择性。虽然在给定的文本中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离可以通过控制催化剂表面活性位点的分布和可及性来解决选择性问题，从而发挥关键作用。

5. 过程效率：效率受催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的共同影响。例如，钼基催化剂在活性和选择性/稳定性之间提供了一种权衡。

研究各种反应途径及其能量学为优化催化剂设计和反应条件以提高ODH效率提供了见解。了解不同C-H键活化对整体动力学的贡献对于开发更具选择性和效率的ODH过程至关重要。
