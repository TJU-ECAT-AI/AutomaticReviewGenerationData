[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes offers an attractive route to alkenes. While nonoxidative dehydrogenation is endothermic and leads to the concurrent formation of carbon, which, in turn, deactivates the catalysts, ODH is exothermic by forming water as a byproduct and eliminating the coke formation, leading to stable catalysts."

[2] "Several metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for ODH, and vanadium-based materials are among the most active. Molybdenum-based oxides are the other promising catalysts for ODH. Although with less activity, some Mo-based catalysts show higher propylene selectivity as well as better thermostability."

[3] "It was concluded that ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts follow the same mechanism and that two lattice oxygens participate in the irreversible activation of the CH bonds in propane via a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism."

[4] "We predict that hydrogen abstraction by MoO is the most feasible reaction pathway. We find that activation of the methylene CH bond is easier than activation of the methyl CH bond in the initial step of the CH activation."

[5] "Our calculations infer that methyl and methylene groups in propane should make a comparative contribution to the experimentally observed overall kinetic isotopic effects from propane to propylene on the MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts."

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising process for producing alkenes, offering advantages over non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The key factors influencing ODH efficiency include:

1. Catalyst choice: Various metal oxides have been studied, with vanadium-based and molybdenum-based catalysts showing promising results. Mo-based catalysts, while less active, demonstrate higher propylene selectivity and better thermostability.

2. Reaction mechanism: The process follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, involving two lattice oxygens in the activation of C-H bonds. Hydrogen abstraction by metal-oxygen (e.g., MoO) groups is identified as the most feasible pathway.

3. C-H bond activation: Activation of methylene C-H bonds is generally easier than methyl C-H bonds, but both contribute to the overall kinetics, as evidenced by kinetic isotope effects.

4. Selectivity challenges: The interplay between methylene and methyl C-H bond activations affects product selectivity. Higher temperatures tend to decrease selectivity for specific C-H bond activation.

5. Site isolation: While not explicitly discussed in the given quotes, site isolation is an important concept in addressing selectivity issues. It involves designing catalysts where active sites are spatially separated to prevent unwanted side reactions.

The efficiency of ODH is a result of the complex interplay between these factors. Catalyst design must balance activity, selectivity, and stability. Understanding the reaction mechanisms and the role of different C-H bonds helps in optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions. The challenge lies in achieving high conversion rates while maintaining selectivity towards desired alkene products.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一种生产烯烃的有前景的工艺，相比非氧化脱氢具有优势。影响ODH效率的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂选择：研究了各种金属氧化物，其中钒基和钼基催化剂显示出promising的结果。虽然钼基催化剂活性较低，但表现出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的热稳定性。

2. 反应机理：该过程遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理，涉及两个晶格氧参与C-H键的活化。金属-氧（如MoO）基团的氢提取被认为是最可行的途径。

3. C-H键活化：亚甲基C-H键的活化通常比甲基C-H键更容易，但两者都对整体动力学有贡献，这从动力学同位素效应中可以看出。

4. 选择性挑战：亚甲基和甲基C-H键活化之间的相互作用影响产物选择性。较高的温度往往会降低对特定C-H键活化的选择性。

5. 位点隔离：虽然在给出的引文中没有明确讨论，但位点隔离是解决选择性问题的一个重要概念。它涉及设计活性位点在空间上分离的催化剂，以防止不需要的副反应。

ODH的效率是这些因素复杂相互作用的结果。催化剂设计必须平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。理解反应机理和不同C-H键的作用有助于优化催化剂和反应条件。挑战在于在保持对所需烯烃产物的选择性的同时实现高转化率。
