I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

tack of the aromatic C-H bond bv cationic 
Pdill) species 
form IMa 
by 
of a l k  n e
to give IMb. A trans 
insertion of C-C triple bonds to the cr-awl- 
pd bond (23-25) results in I M  ,
and ill 
arenelalkyne 
be 
from Pd(II) (24) upon protonation of IMc. 
The possible involvement of Pd(I1)-vinyli- 
dine and Pd(I1)-allenyl complexes could be 
excluded (26, 27). In the addition of alk- 
oxyarenes to activated alkenes, the involve- 
ment of the carbocations from alkenes may 
be possible. 
Many of the products offered by this re- 
action [such as coumarins, 2(1H)-quinolino- 
nes, and cis-aryl-a,P-unsaturated carbonyl 
compounds] are biologically relevant com-
pounds and cannot otherwise be easily ac-
cessed by known reactions. This process of- 
fers a general, simple, and efficient method 
for converting simple arenes directly to po- 
tentially useful compounds in one step under 
mild conditions. This method should have 
many applications in organic and medical 
chemistry and possibly be applied by chem- 
ical and pharmaceutical industries.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
