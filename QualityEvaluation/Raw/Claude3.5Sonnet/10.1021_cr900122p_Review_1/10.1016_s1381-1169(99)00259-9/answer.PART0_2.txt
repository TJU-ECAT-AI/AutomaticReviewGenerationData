The given literature does not contain information specifically related to the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts, which is a different process. It does not discuss bulk metal oxides, ODH reaction mechanisms, or site isolation effects. The literature primarily deals with experimental design and modeling of isobutane dehydrogenation activity in relation to factors like catalyst support, chromium loading, reaction conditions, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide a relevant answer to the question about ODH based on this specific document.

给定的文献不包含与烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)特别相关的信息。该文档主要关注负载型氧化铬催化剂上异丁烷的脱氢,这是一个不同的过程。它没有讨论块状金属氧化物、ODH反应机理或位点隔离效应。该文献主要涉及异丁烷脱氢活性与催化剂载体、铬负载量、反应条件等因素关系的实验设计和建模。因此,我无法根据这份特定文档对ODH问题提供相关答案。
