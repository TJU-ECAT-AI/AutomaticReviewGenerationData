[1] "As is typically the case for partial oxidation there is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion, whether the reaction is carried out in "normal" catalytic fashion or by the cyclic "redox" modification (eq. (2))."

[2] "Point 3 implies that the ability to control the relative reactivities of different species by changing the catalyst-a factor which is crucial in. determining the conversion-selectivity relationship-may be strictly limited."

[3] "If radical H- abstraction is the key step in these reactions, as several studies strongly indicate [3,7,9], then (absent some degree of shape-selectivity, which will be difficult to achieve at the high temperatures required) the best catalyst should be essentially non-discriminating between various types of C-H bonds [10]."

[4] "The relative rates of reaction with the metal oxide for the various hydrocarbons-methane, ethane, ethylene, propene (eqs. (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)-are very similar to those for reactions of gas-phase radicals (CH30., HO. ), implying they are determined simply by C-H bond strengths."

The document does not specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), but instead focuses on oxidative coupling of methane. However, some of the principles and challenges discussed can be applied to ODH:

1. There is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion in partial oxidation reactions, which is likely applicable to ODH as well.

2. The ability to control relative reactivities of different species by changing the catalyst may be limited, which could pose challenges for achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously in ODH.

3. Radical H-abstraction appears to be a key step in these oxidative reactions, with catalysts behaving similarly to gas-phase radicals in terms of reactivity towards different C-H bonds.

4. The relative rates of reaction for various hydrocarbons with metal oxide catalysts are determined primarily by C-H bond strengths, rather than specific catalyst properties.

These factors collectively suggest that achieving high selectivity and conversion in ODH processes may be challenging due to inherent mechanistic limitations. The document does not specifically address site isolation or its role in addressing selectivity issues.

该文档并未具体讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)，而是主要关注甲烷的氧化偶联。然而，其中讨论的一些原理和挑战可以应用于ODH：

1. 在部分氧化反应中，选择性和转化率之间存在很强的反比关系，这可能也适用于ODH。

2. 通过改变催化剂来控制不同物种相对反应活性的能力可能受到限制，这可能会给ODH同时实现高选择性和高转化率带来挑战。

3. 自由基H-抽提似乎是这些氧化反应的关键步骤，催化剂在对不同C-H键的反应活性方面的表现与气相自由基相似。

4. 各种烃类与金属氧化物催化剂的相对反应速率主要由C-H键强度决定，而不是由特定的催化剂性质决定。

这些因素综合起来表明，由于固有的机理限制，在ODH过程中实现高选择性和高转化率可能具有挑战性。该文档没有具体提到位点隔离或其在解决选择性问题中的作用。
