[1] "While indisputable forecasts of the engineering feasibility of this approach and its economic competitiveness with current technology are not yet available, it has been estimated that around 20-25% per pass yield (conversion times selectivity) of higher hydrocarbon products would be the minimum requirement for a viable process [2]."

[2] "CO2 is produced by two paths: a primary one, directly from CH3· (eq. (5)), and a secondary one, via ethylene. The latter is the main source of CO2 at higher (> 15%) conversions."

[3] "The relative rates of reaction with the metal oxide for the various hydrocarbons-methane, ethane, ethylene, propene (eqs. (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)-are very similar to those for reactions of gas-phase radicals (CH3O·, HO· ), implying they are determined simply by C-H bond strengths."

[4] "If radical H- abstraction is the key step in these reactions, as several studies strongly indicate [3,7,9], then (absent some degree of shape-selectivity, which will be difficult to achieve at the high temperatures required) the best catalyst should be essentially non-discriminating between various types of C-H bonds [10]."

The provided literature does not specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). Instead, it focuses on oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). However, some general principles discussed can be applied to ODH:

1. Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is challenging. The literature mentions a target of 20-25% yield (conversion times selectivity) as a minimum for viability in OCM.

2. Reaction mechanisms involve radical processes. The document discusses CH3· radicals and H-abstraction as key steps, which are also relevant in ODH reactions.

3. Catalyst selectivity is limited by C-H bond strengths. The literature suggests that the best catalysts may not discriminate significantly between different C-H bonds, which could apply to ODH as well.

4. Multiple reaction pathways compete. In OCM, CO2 is produced both directly and via secondary reactions of desired products. Similar competing pathways likely exist in ODH.

5. Site isolation is not directly discussed in this literature.

The document does not provide specific information on different catalysts for ODH or the role of site isolation. To fully answer the question, additional literature focused on ODH would be required.

提供的文献并未具体讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)。相反,它主要关注甲烷的氧化偶联(OCM)。然而,其中讨论的一些一般原则可以应用于ODH:

1. 同时实现高选择性和高转化率具有挑战性。文献提到OCM的可行性最低目标是20-25%的收率(转化率乘以选择性)。

2. 反应机理涉及自由基过程。文档讨论了CH3·自由基和H-抽提作为关键步骤,这些在ODH反应中也是相关的。

3. 催化剂选择性受C-H键强度限制。文献表明,最佳催化剂可能不会显著区分不同的C-H键,这也可能适用于ODH。

4. 多个反应途径相互竞争。在OCM中,CO2既直接产生,也通过所需产物的二次反应产生。ODH中可能存在类似的竞争路径。

5. 文献中没有直接讨论位点隔离。

该文档没有提供关于ODH不同催化剂或位点隔离作用的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题,需要额外的专注于ODH的文献。
