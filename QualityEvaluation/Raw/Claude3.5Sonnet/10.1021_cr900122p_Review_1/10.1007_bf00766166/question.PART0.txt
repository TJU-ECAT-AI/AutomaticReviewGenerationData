OXIDATIVE COUPLING OF METHANE: 
AN INHERENT LIMIT TO SELECTIVITY? 
Jay A. LABINGER

Received 10 August 1988; accepted 30 September 1988 
Mechanistic considerations show that pressure must be taken into account in evaluating 
oxidative coupling catalyst performance, and predict an upper limit of around 30% yield of 
higher hydrocarbons at one atmosphere. 
The oxidative coupling of methane (eq. (1)) has received intense interest over 
the last few years as a potentially practical alternative to syngas-based routes for 
conversion of natural gas to liquids [1]. The goal, obviously, is to achieve high 
selectivity for C2+ hydrocarbon products. As is typically the case for partial 
oxidation there is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion, 
whether the reaction is carried out in "normal" catalytic fashion or by the cyclic 
"redox" modification (eq. (2)).

While indisputable forecasts of the engineering feasibility of this approach and 
its economic competitiveness with current technology are not yet available, it has 
been estimated that around 20-25% per pass yield (conversion times selectivity) 
of higher hydrocarbon products would be the minimum requirement for a viable 
process [2]. In fact, there are a number of literature reports with quite different 
catalysts that appear to meet or surpass this target, suggesting that even substan- 
tially better yields might be achieved with the right catalyst. Mechanistic consid- 
erations, however suggest that this picture may be much too optimistic. First, 
there is a pronounced pressure effect which makes many of the published results 
appear better than they will be under practical conditions; second, mechanistic 
constraints seem to place an upper bound on yield, independent of catalyst, which 
is not far above the target values. This latter presents arguments in support of 
these claims.

We have reported studies which led to a complete kinetic model for the 
oxidative coupling of methane by a mixed Mn-Mg oxide, following eq. (2) [3]. 
The reaction network deduced is shown in the Scheme, with the following key 
points: 
1. CO 
z is produced by two paths: a primary one, directly from CH 
3 9 (eq. (5)), 
and a secondary one, via ethylene. The latter is the main source of CO 
2 at higher 
(> 15%) conversions.

ref. [8]; Li/MgO, ref. [9]. 
2. Much of the ethylene forms by the gas-phase reaction of CH 3 9 with ethane 
(eq. (8)). Note that this is a second-order step, and ethylene is a major precursor 
to CO2, by reaction with both the catalyst (eq. (9)) and (via acetylene) with CH 3 9 
(eq. (12)), another second-order step. 
3. The relative rates of reaction with the metal oxide for the various hydro- 
carbons-methane, ethane, ethylene, propene (eqs. (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)-are very similar 
to those for reactions of gas-phase radicals (CH30., HO. ), implying they are 
determined simply by C-H bond strengths. 
Point 2 implies that at high conversion, where most of the CO 
2 is produced 
sequentially from ethylene rather than directly from CH3. , selectivity will 
decrease as pressure increases. This is in fact the case [3]. The vast majority of 
published data are collected at low methane partial pressures, which inflates the 
apparent yield. Figure 1 shows some of the better published yields plotted against 
methane partial pressure, and includes a set of data which clearly demonstrate 
this pressure effect [4]. It can be seen that very few catalysts in the literature 
approach the target of 25% yield at or above atmospheric pressure, which will 
certainly be needed in a practical process. 
Point 3 implies that the ability to control the relative reactivities of different 
species by changing the catalyst-a factor which is crucial in. determining the 
conversion-selectivity relationship-may be strictly limited. If radical H- abstrac- 
tion is the key step in these reactions, as several studies strongly indicate [3,7,9], 
then (absent some degree of shape-selectivity, which will be difficult to achieve at 
the high temperatures required) the best catalyst should be essentially non-dis- 
criminating between various types of C-H bonds [10]. Since the rates for the

Fig. 2. Calculated "optimal" selectivity-conversion relationships and best experimental results; see 
text for details. 
Mn-Mg catalyst used here closely parallel those of species like OH-, this has 
already been achieved. 
What, then, can be done to improve performance? Conceptually, two things: 
(i) Increase overall catalyst activity. This will reduce the relative importance of 
purely gas-phase reactions such as eqs. (8) and (12) that are CO 
2 producers. 
(ii) Decrease the relative rate for eq. (5). This would cut down on the 
contribution of direct conversion to CO 
2. 
The quantitative effects of these catalyst "modifications" can be estimated by 
making suitable adjustments in the model evolved in the earlier studies [3]. Based 
on examination of a very large number of materials, increases in activity over that 
baseline catalyst of 3-10 fold are achievable. As for the relative rate of eq. (5), it 
was determined to be 2700 times that of eq. (3) for the original study [3]. Using 
gas-phase studies on O atom reactions as the best available model [11], a value of 
150 can be taken as a lower limit. 
Figure 2 shows the effects of these modifications. Curve a is the baseline [3]; in 
the rest, k s is adjusted to 150 times k 1, while the set of rates k 3, k 6, k 9, kl0 and 
k14 are all set at 1 (b), 3 (c), and 10 (d) times their baseline values. From the 
resulting curves, there appears to be a mechanistically imposed limit of around 
30% yield at 1 atmosphere. This limit has not been exceeded (or indeed often 
approached, as seen in fig. 1) by any published results. The points in fig. 2 
correspond to the "best redox" result of fig. 1 [8]; note that they agree well, both 
in top yield and in the shape of the selectivity-conversion relation, with the 
predicted behavior.

Of course, the mechanistic underpinning to these arguments derive from 
studies on a single catalyst in redox mode. However, there is considerable 
evidence that the mechanisms for other catalysts, even with cofed oxygen, are 
closely similar if not identical. This includes the pressure trends cited above; 
findings that ethylene is the crucial CO 
x precursor [12], and very close resemb- 
lances between product distributions using the same 
catalyst in redox and cofeed 
mode [13]. It may thus be argued that these conclusions are general, with two 
main consequences: pressure must be taken into account in evaluating the relative 
merits of literature data; and investing in a major program in oxidative coupling 
predicated on the expectation that substantial improvements in performance may 
be achieved with enough work, might not be wise decision.

Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?
