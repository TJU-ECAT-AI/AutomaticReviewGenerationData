[1] "As is typically the case for partial oxidation there is a strong inverse correlation between selectivity and conversion, whether the reaction is carried out in "normal" catalytic fashion or by the cyclic "redox" modification (eq. (2))."

[2] "Mechanistic considerations, however suggest that this picture may be much too optimistic. First, there is a pronounced pressure effect which makes many of the published results appear better than they will be under practical conditions; second, mechanistic constraints seem to place an upper bound on yield, independent of catalyst, which is not far above the target values."

[3] "CO2 is produced by two paths: a primary one, directly from CH3· (eq. (5)), and a secondary one, via ethylene. The latter is the main source of CO2 at higher (> 15%) conversions."

[4] "The relative rates of reaction with the metal oxide for the various hydrocarbons-methane, ethane, ethylene, propene (eqs. (3, 6, 9, 10, 14)-are very similar to those for reactions of gas-phase radicals (CH3O·, HO·), implying they are determined simply by C-H bond strengths."

[5] "If radical H-abstraction is the key step in these reactions, as several studies strongly indicate [3,7,9], then (absent some degree of shape-selectivity, which will be difficult to achieve at the high temperatures required) the best catalyst should be essentially non-discriminating between various types of C-H bonds [10]."

The document does not directly discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), but rather focuses on oxidative coupling of methane. However, some insights can be drawn from the provided information that may be relevant to ODH:

The text highlights a fundamental challenge in partial oxidation reactions, including ODH: there is typically an inverse relationship between selectivity and conversion. This suggests that achieving both high selectivity and high conversion simultaneously is difficult in such processes.

The document emphasizes the importance of considering pressure effects when evaluating catalyst performance. In ODH, pressure could similarly impact the apparent effectiveness of catalysts and influence the overall process efficiency.

The reaction mechanism described involves radical intermediates and C-H bond activation. In ODH, similar mechanisms involving C-H bond activation are often proposed. The document suggests that the relative reactivity of different C-H bonds is primarily determined by bond strengths rather than specific catalyst properties.

The concept of "site isolation" is not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, the discussion of catalyst non-discrimination between different C-H bonds implies that developing catalysts with more selective active sites could be challenging, especially at high temperatures.

While the document focuses on methane coupling rather than ODH, it suggests that there may be inherent mechanistic limitations to the achievable yields in partial oxidation processes. This could potentially apply to ODH as well, though specific limitations would likely differ.

Overall, while the text doesn't directly address ODH, it highlights general challenges in selective oxidation catalysis that are likely relevant to ODH processes, including the difficulty of balancing selectivity and conversion, the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms, and the potential for inherent limitations in catalyst performance.

虽然文档并未直接讨论烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH），而是集中讨论甲烷的氧化偶联，但从提供的信息中可以得出一些与ODH相关的见解：

文本强调了部分氧化反应中的一个基本挑战，包括ODH：选择性和转化率之间通常存在反比关系。这表明在这种过程中同时实现高选择性和高转化率是困难的。

文档强调在评估催化剂性能时考虑压力效应的重要性。在ODH中，压力同样可能影响催化剂的表观有效性并影响整个过程的效率。

所描述的反应机理涉及自由基中间体和C-H键活化。在ODH中，通常也提出涉及C-H键活化的类似机理。文档表明，不同C-H键的相对反应性主要由键强度决定，而不是特定的催化剂性质。

文本中没有明确提到"位点隔离"的概念。然而，关于催化剂对不同C-H键无歧视的讨论暗示，开发具有更选择性活性位点的催化剂可能具有挑战性，特别是在高温下。

虽然文档主要关注甲烷偶联而不是ODH，但它表明部分氧化过程中可能存在固有的机理限制，影响可达到的产率。这可能也适用于ODH，尽管具体限制可能有所不同。

总的来说，虽然文本没有直接讨论ODH，但它强调了选择性氧化催化中的一般挑战，这些挑战可能与ODH过程相关，包括平衡选择性和转化率的困难、理解反应机理的重要性，以及催化剂性能可能存在固有限制。
