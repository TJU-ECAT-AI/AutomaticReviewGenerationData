[1] "Recent reports have demonstrated that N2O is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides."

[2] "The O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, have been postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction."

[3] "The stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with O- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium heptamolybdate at pH = 2."

[4] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."

The literature provides some insights into oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, though it primarily focuses on methane oxidation rather than ODH specifically. However, we can extrapolate some relevant information:

1. Catalysts: The study uses molybdenum oxide supported on silica as a catalyst. This supported system shows higher activity compared to bulk silica gel, demonstrating the importance of the support in enhancing catalytic performance.

2. Oxidants: N2O is identified as an effective oxidant for ODH of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. This suggests that the choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in the process efficiency.

3. Active species: O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, are proposed as the active species that initiate the catalytic process through hydrogen abstraction. This provides insight into the reaction mechanism.

4. Selectivity and conversion: The study achieves 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion, which is described as better than previous results. This highlights the challenge of balancing selectivity and conversion in oxidation reactions.

5. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction by O- ions, suggesting a similar pathway might be involved in ODH reactions.

6. Site isolation: While not explicitly discussed, the use of supported catalysts implies some degree of site isolation, which could contribute to improved selectivity by preventing over-oxidation.

The study doesn't directly address the formation of M-alkyl intermediates or 2H-abstraction in ODH. However, the focus on O- ions as active species and the hydrogen abstraction mechanism provides valuable insights into how these factors collectively influence process efficiency in related oxidation reactions.

这篇文献提供了一些关于烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的见解,尽管它主要集中在甲烷氧化而非特定的ODH。然而,我们可以从中推断一些相关信息:

1. 催化剂:该研究使用负载在二氧化硅上的三氧化钼作为催化剂。与纯二氧化硅凝胶相比,这种负载系统显示出更高的活性,表明载体在提高催化性能方面的重要性。

2. 氧化剂:N2O被确定为在负载钼氧化物上进行乙烷ODH的有效氧化剂。这表明氧化剂的选择在过程效率中起着关键作用。

3. 活性物种:由N2O表面分解形成的O-离子被提出作为通过氢抽提启动催化过程的活性物种。这为反应机理提供了见解。

4. 选择性和转化率:该研究在16%转化率下实现了60%的CH3OH和H2CO选择性,据描述优于先前的结果。这凸显了在氧化反应中平衡选择性和转化率的挑战。

5. 反应机理:提出的机理涉及O-离子的氢抽提,这表明ODH反应可能涉及类似的途径。

6. 位点隔离:虽然没有明确讨论,但使用负载催化剂意味着某种程度的位点隔离,这可能通过防止过度氧化来提高选择性。

该研究没有直接讨论ODH中M-烷基中间体的形成或2H-抽提。然而,对O-离子作为活性物种的关注以及氢抽提机理为这些因素如何共同影响相关氧化反应的过程效率提供了有价值的见解。
