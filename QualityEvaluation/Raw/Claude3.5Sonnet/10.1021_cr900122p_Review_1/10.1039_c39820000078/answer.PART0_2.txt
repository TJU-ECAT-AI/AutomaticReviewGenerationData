[1] "Recent reports have demonstrated that N2O is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides."

[2] "The O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, have been postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction."

[3] "The stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with O- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium heptamolybdate at pH = 2."

[4] "Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C."

[5] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."

The literature provides some insights into oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, focusing mainly on methane oxidation using nitrous oxide (N2O) over supported molybdenum oxide catalysts. While it doesn't comprehensively address all aspects of the question, it offers relevant information on catalysts, selectivity, conversion, and reaction mechanisms.

The study uses molybdenum oxide supported on silica as a catalyst for methane oxidation. This supported system shows higher activity compared to bulk silica gel, demonstrating the importance of the support in enhancing catalytic performance.

The reaction mechanism involves O- ions formed by surface decomposition of N2O. These O- ions are proposed to initiate the catalytic process through hydrogen abstraction from the alkane. This suggests a C-H bond activation mechanism in the ODH process.

The research achieves relatively high selectivity and moderate conversion, reporting 60% combined selectivity to methanol and formaldehyde at 16% conversion. This performance is noted as being better than previously reported results, indicating progress in addressing the challenge of achieving both high selectivity and conversion.

The study also highlights the role of reaction conditions in influencing selectivity. For instance, desorption temperatures above 300°C favor methanol formation. Additionally, the presence of water is shown to affect product distribution, potentially by inhibiting secondary reactions.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss site isolation, the use of supported catalysts and the observed performance improvements suggest that dispersion of active sites on the support may play a role in enhancing selectivity.

Overall, this study demonstrates the interplay between catalyst choice, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways in determining the efficiency of the ODH process. It shows that careful tuning of these factors can lead to improved selectivity and conversion in alkane oxidation reactions.

这篇文献为烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)提供了一些见解，主要关注使用一氧化二氮(N2O)在负载型钼氧化物催化剂上进行甲烷氧化。虽然它没有全面涉及问题的所有方面，但它提供了有关催化剂、选择性、转化率和反应机理的相关信息。

研究使用负载在二氧化硅上的钼氧化物作为甲烷氧化的催化剂。与块状二氧化硅凝胶相比，这种负载系统显示出更高的活性，证明了载体在提高催化性能方面的重要性。

反应机理涉及由N2O表面分解形成的O-离子。这些O-离子被认为通过从烷烃中提取氢来启动催化过程。这表明ODH过程中存在C-H键活化机制。

研究达到了相对较高的选择性和中等的转化率，报告在16%转化率下甲醇和甲醛的综合选择性为60%。这一性能被认为优于先前报道的结果，表明在实现高选择性和高转化率方面取得了进展。

研究还强调了反应条件在影响选择性方面的作用。例如，300°C以上的脱附温度有利于甲醇的形成。此外，水的存在被证明会影响产物分布，可能是通过抑制二次反应。

虽然文献没有明确讨论位点隔离，但使用负载型催化剂以及观察到的性能改善表明，活性位点在载体上的分散可能在提高选择性方面起作用。

总的来说，这项研究展示了催化剂选择、反应条件和机理途径之间的相互作用如何决定ODH过程的效率。它表明，仔细调整这些因素可以提高烷烃氧化反应的选择性和转化率。
