[1] "Recent reports have demonstrated that N2O is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides."

[2] "The O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, have been postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction."

[3] "The stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with O- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium heptamolybdate at pH = 2."

[4] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."

The literature provides limited information specifically on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, but it does offer some insights into related processes that can be applied to ODH:

1. Catalysts: The study focuses on molybdenum oxide supported on silica for methane oxidation. This supported system shows higher activity compared to bulk silica gel, highlighting the importance of metal oxide catalysts in such reactions.

2. Oxidants: N2O is described as an effective oxidant for ethane ODH over supported molybdenum oxides. This suggests that the choice of oxidant can significantly impact the reaction efficiency.

3. Active species: O- ions, formed by N2O decomposition on the catalyst surface, are proposed as the active species initiating the catalytic process through hydrogen abstraction. This mechanism could be relevant to ODH reactions.

4. Selectivity and conversion: The study reports 60% selectivity to methanol and formaldehyde at 16% conversion for methane oxidation. While this is not directly ODH, it demonstrates the challenge of balancing selectivity and conversion in partial oxidation reactions.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The paper suggests a hydrogen abstraction mechanism initiated by O- ions, which could be analogous to the C-H bond activation step in ODH reactions.

The study does not directly address site isolation or its role in selectivity. However, the use of supported molybdenum oxide catalysts implies some degree of site isolation compared to bulk oxides, which may contribute to the improved selectivity observed.

While the paper doesn't provide comprehensive information on ODH of alkanes, it offers insights into related catalytic oxidation processes that can inform our understanding of ODH reactions and catalyst design.

该文献对烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的具体信息有限，但它提供了一些相关过程的见解，可以应用于ODH：

1. 催化剂：该研究主要关注硅胶负载的钼氧化物用于甲烷氧化。这种负载型催化剂系统比纯硅胶表现出更高的活性，突显了金属氧化物催化剂在此类反应中的重要性。

2. 氧化剂：文中描述N2O是乙烷ODH反应中负载型钼氧化物催化剂的有效氧化剂。这表明氧化剂的选择可以显著影响反应效率。

3. 活性物种：由N2O在催化剂表面分解形成的O-离子被提出是通过氢抽提启动催化过程的活性物种。这一机制可能与ODH反应相关。

4. 选择性和转化率：研究报告了甲烷氧化反应中16%转化率下对甲醇和甲醛的60%选择性。虽然这不是直接的ODH反应，但它展示了部分氧化反应中平衡选择性和转化率的挑战。

5. 反应机理：论文提出了由O-离子引发的氢抽提机制，这可能类似于ODH反应中的C-H键活化步骤。

该研究没有直接讨论位点隔离或其在选择性中的作用。然而，使用负载型钼氧化物催化剂意味着与块状氧化物相比具有一定程度的位点隔离，这可能有助于观察到的选择性改善。

虽然该论文没有提供关于烷烃ODH的全面信息，但它为相关的催化氧化过程提供了见解，这些见解可以增进我们对ODH反应和催化剂设计的理解。
