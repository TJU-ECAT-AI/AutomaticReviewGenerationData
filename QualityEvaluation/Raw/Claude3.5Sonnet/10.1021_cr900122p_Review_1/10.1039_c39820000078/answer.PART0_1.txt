[1] "Recent reports have demonstrated that N2O is a very effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides."

[2] "The O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, have been postulated as active species in initiating the catalytic process via a hydrogen abstraction reaction."

[3] "The stoicheiometric reaction of CH4 with O- was studied in a conventional gas-circulating system with a catalyst prepared by impregnating silica gel with ammonium heptamolybdate at pH = 2."

[4] "Methanol was observed as the main product at desorption temperatures exceeding 300 °C."

[5] "Under the experimental conditions, silica gel was an order of magnitude less active. The combined 60% selectivity to CH3OH and H2CO at 16% conversion is considerably better than results reported in the literature."

The literature primarily focuses on the partial oxidation of methane rather than the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH). However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

1. Catalysts: The study uses molybdenum oxide supported on silica as a catalyst. This supported system shows higher activity compared to bulk silica gel, demonstrating the importance of the active metal component.

2. Oxidant: Nitrous oxide (N2O) is described as an effective oxidant for ODH of ethane over supported molybdenum oxides. This suggests that the choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in the process efficiency.

3. Active species: O- ions, formed by surface decomposition of N2O, are proposed as the active species that initiate the catalytic process through hydrogen abstraction. This provides insight into the reaction mechanism involving C-H bond activation.

4. Selectivity and conversion: The study reports a combined 60% selectivity to methanol and formaldehyde at 16% conversion, which is described as better than previous results. This highlights the challenge of achieving both high selectivity and high conversion in oxidation reactions.

5. Reaction conditions: The presence of water and temperature control are shown to influence product distribution, emphasizing the importance of optimizing reaction conditions.

While the study doesn't directly address site isolation, the use of a supported catalyst system (Mo on silica) suggests an attempt to disperse active sites, which can potentially improve selectivity.

The information provided doesn't cover all aspects of the question, such as M-alkyl intermediates or 2H-abstraction mechanisms. However, it does illustrate the complex interplay between catalyst choice, oxidant, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways in determining the efficiency of partial oxidation processes.

这篇文献主要关注甲烷的部分氧化而非烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)。然而，从所提供的信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 催化剂：研究使用二氧化硅负载的钼氧化物作为催化剂。与纯二氧化硅相比，这种负载系统表现出更高的活性，展示了活性金属组分的重要性。

2. 氧化剂：一氧化二氮(N2O)被描述为在负载钼氧化物上进行乙烷ODH的有效氧化剂。这表明氧化剂的选择对工艺效率起着至关重要的作用。

3. 活性物种：由N2O表面分解形成的O-离子被提出作为通过氢抽提启动催化过程的活性物种。这为涉及C-H键活化的反应机理提供了见解。

4. 选择性和转化率：研究报告在16%转化率下对甲醇和甲醛的综合选择性为60%，这被描述为优于先前的结果。这突出了在氧化反应中同时实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战。

5. 反应条件：水的存在和温度控制被证明会影响产物分布，强调了优化反应条件的重要性。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及位点隔离，但使用负载催化剂系统（二氧化硅负载的钼）表明试图分散活性位点，这可能会提高选择性。

所提供的信息并未涵盖问题的所有方面，如M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提机理。然而，它确实说明了催化剂选择、氧化剂、反应条件和机理途径之间的复杂相互作用在决定部分氧化过程效率方面的重要性。
