The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde by molecular oxygen has been studied using 
vanadium(V) oxide-silica 
catalysts in the temperature range 773-873 K at 1 atm pressure. Al- 
though HCHO selectivity in excess of 70% was observed at very low conversions, it was found to 
decrease rapidly as the extent of reaction was increased. At the highest conversions studied (6.4%), 
carbon monoxide was the principal reaction product. Methane oxidation was found to follow a 
sequential reaction path, where formaldehyde is formed from methane, carbon monoxide from 
formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide from carbon monoxide. This is in contrast to the molyb- 
denum(W) oxide-silica-catalyzed 
reaction, where CO2 
is formed directly from methane in a paral- 
lel pathway. A model has been constructed based on the sequential mechanism and experimentally 
derived kinetic parameters. It accounts for the observed selectivity and conversion behavior of this 
Catalyst.

INTRODUCTION 
Formaldehyde is currently manufactured 
from methane via syngas and methanol (I- 
3). A process for the production of formal- 
dehyde directly from methane would poten- 
tially reduce both capital and operating 
costs, and therefore be of considerable in- 
dustrial importance. Until recently, how- 
ever, high selectivities 
to formaldehyde 
have been achievable only by using nitrous 
oxide as an oxidant (4-6). 
Recently, we reported (7, 8) that Mo03- 
SiOz catalyzed the reaction of CH4 with O2 
to form HCHO. Kinetic analysis indicated 
that the methane is directly oxidized to COz 
and HCHO, with HCHO being further oxi- 
dized to CO. High HCHO selectivities were 
observed at low CH4 conversions 
and 
HCHO selectivity decreased monotonically 
with increasing conversion. Another ob- 
served trend was that the HCHO selectivity 
increased with increasing temperature at a 
fixed CH4 conversion. 
Unfortunately, 
at 
temperatures above 923 K and high CH4 
conversions, selectivity to HCHO contin- 
ued to increase only slightly, presumably 
due to the onset of undesirable side reac- 
tions (such as gas-phase HCHO oxidation, 
CO + CO*, and the water-gas shift reac- 
tion) . 
Although references to the partial oxida- 
tion of methane over V205-SiO2 exist in the 
patent literature (6, 9), there are few papers 
on the subject. Zhen et al. (5) found that 
Vz05-Si02 catalyzed the reaction when 
N20 was used as an oxidant, producing 
methanol and formaldehyde in high selec- 
tivities. In the present work, the Vz05- 
Si02-catalyzed partial oxidation of CH4 has 
been studied using molecular oxygen. A ki- 
netic model that describes the conversion 
and selectivity for V205-Si02 catalysts has 
been proposed. The kinetic parameters ob- 
tained are compared with those previously 
obtained for the MoOX-SiOz system and it 
is shown that V205-SiO2 is the more active 
catalyst. However, there appear to be im- 
portant differences in the mechanisms op- 
erating in the two systems. 
METHODS 
The V205-Si02 catalysts were prepared 
from ammonium metavanadate and silica. 
The silica sources were either Cabosil M5

silica gel (manufactured by 
the Davison Chemical Division of W. R. 
Grace & Co.) The latter was washed in a 
stream of dilute sulfuric acid (pH 3) at 373 
K to reduce the sodium level. When it was 
washed for several days, the sodium level 
in the silica was reduced to 20 ppm, and this 
material is referred to as acid-washed sil- 
ica gel (AWSG). VZ05-AWSG catalysts 
were prepared by slurrying the gel with am- 
monium metavanadate solution and evapo- 
rating to dryness. This was followed by cal- 
cination 
at 873 K for 
several hours. 
VzOs-Cabosil catalysts were prepared by 
incipient wetness impregnation, followed 
by drying and calcination. Vanadium and 
sodium analyses of the catalysts were car- 
ried out by atomic absorption spectros- 
copy. Prior to use, catalysts made from 
Cabosil were compressed at 15,000 psi and 
crushed, and all catalysts were screened to 
a particle size of OS-O.7 mm. Properties of 
the screened catalysts are summarized in 
Table 1. 
Small samples of catalysts (0.2 g) were 
tested at atmospheric pressure in a quartz 
flow 
microreactor 
with 
gas chromato- 
graphic detection of products. The appa- 
ratus has been described in detail elsewhere 
(7). 
A 
methane-oxygen 
mixture 
was 
passed at 1 atm over the catalyst at gas 
hourly space velocities ranging from 1000 
to 20,000 h-i (at NTP). Due to the highly 
exothermic nature of methane oxidation, 
great care was exercised to minimize non- 
isothermal effects. The catalyst tempera- 
ture was varied from 773 to 873 K.

were carried out by passing an argon-oxy- 
gen (10% 02) mixture through a thermo- 
stated bubbler containing 
paraformalde- 
hyde. In this way, steady-state, gas-phase 
HCHO concentrations of 0.7 01% could 
readily be fed into the reactor and over the 
same catalyst bed that was used for the 
methane oxidation experiments. A constant 
space velocity of 5000 h-i (NTP) was used 
and the temperature was varied from 443 to 
873 K. 
RESULTS 
The principal products of methane oxida- 
tion were found to be formaldehyde, carbon 
monoxide, 
carbon dioxide, 
and water. 
Methanol and hydrogen were detected in 
trace quantities. Substituting quartz chips 
for the catalyst resulted in negligible meth- 
ane conversion over the range of operating 
conditions described above. This suggests 
that gas-phase reactions are not significant 
in this study. When AWSG was used as a 
catalyst, slight methane conversion was de- 
tected. AWSG appears to be approximately 
two orders of magnitude less active than 
VzOj-AWSG, 
and these results are dis- 
cussed in detail elsewhere (7). 
Reactor effluent data obtained using 
VzOs-AWSG under varying operating con- 
ditions have been plotted in the form of 
product selectivity (i.e., the percentage of 
product in the converted methane) vs per- 
centage methane conversion. As shown in 
Fig. la, the formaldehyde selectivity de- 
creases monotonically 
with 
increasing 
methane conversion. 
High formaldehyde 
selectivities are observed at low methane 
conversion, indicating that formaldehyde is 
a primary product. At a given level of meth- 
ane conversion, formaldehyde selectivity 
increases with increasing temperature. Se- 
lectivity to carbon monoxide tends to zero 
at zero methane conversion and increases 
with methane conversion, 
implying 
that 
carbon monoxide is a secondary product 
(Fig. lb). The selectivity to carbon dioxide 
also tends to zero at zero methane conver- 
sion, implying that carbon dioxide is also a

secondary product (Fig. Ic). No change in 
conversion or selectivity behavior was de- 
tected when the methane-to-oxygen ratio 
was varied between 28 : 1 and 10 
: 1, provid- 
ing that oxygen conversion was kept below 
100%. This strongly suggests that the reac- 
tion is zero order in oxygen, as is the case 
with several other hydrocarbon partial oxi- 
dation reactions (8, 10, II). 
Very similar 
selectivity behavior was observed with the 
VZ05-Cabosil and V;?Os-AWSG of compa- 
rable VZOs 
loadings. 
Formaldehyde oxidation results, shown 
in Fig. 2, indicate that carbon monoxide 
and carbon dioxide are the only significant 
reaction products. At low conversion, car- 
bon monoxide is the only product ob- 
served. As the conversion of formaldehyde 
is increased, the carbon monoxide concen- 
tration increases and reaches a maximum 
concentration at -800 K, as formaldehyde 
conversion nears 100% and carbon dioxide 
production 
becomes 
more 
significant. 
These results suggest that carbon monoxide 
is a primary product and carbon dioxide is a 
secondary product of the formaldehyde ox- 
idation reaction, consistent with the results 
discussed above.

tion reaction was found to be kinetically 
controlled and not limited by intraparticle 
diffusion over the temperature range exam- 
ined. For example, at the highest methane 
conversion examined [873 K and space ve- 
locity of 10,000 h-r (GHSV, NTP)] the 
Thiele modulus was calculated to be 0.082, 
using kl = 0.93/s, effective diffusivity

0.014 cm*/s, and pellet radius = 0.03 cm.

ture difference between the bulk gas and

mated to be only 5.2 K and the temperature 
difference between the surface and the cen- 
ter of the particle was estimated to be only

Assuming that the carbon monoxide oxi-

first-order reaction (12), an analytical ex- 
pression for the yield of carbon monoxide 
was derived. This expression was used 
along with the standard nonlinear parame- 
ter estimation method to obtain best-fit val- 
ues for k$ and E3. Goldwasser and Trimm 
(13) have measured rates for CO oxidation 
on V205-Si02 (1 wt% V205). At 733 K, 
their reactor-volume-based rate constant of 
430 h-l compares well with our (model-de- 
rived) k3 value of 441 h-l, showing that our 
mechanism is consistent with the previ- 
ously observed CO oxidation activity of 
V205-Si02. Values of preexponential fac- 
tors and activation energies obtained in our 
study are summarized in Table 2.

go through a maximum as conversion is in- 
creased. The solid lines in Fig. 2 also repre- 
sent model predictions. As in the data, the 
model predicts a maximum in carbon mon- 
oxide concentration. Generally, model pre- 
dictions compare well with the experimen- 
tal observations. 
The mathematical model is built on the 
assumption that the reaction rate is zero or- 
der in oxygen concentration. This assump- 
tion should break down when the oxygen 
concentration becomes very low. This re- 
gime was not extensively investigated as 
the nature of the catalytic 
surface was 
thought to change in low oxygen concentra- 
tions. The upper limit on the oxygen con- 
centration in the reactant mixture was kept 
low and well below the explosion limit. The 
methane conversion was limited by the ox- 
ygen present and in no case exceeded 7%. 
Several of these considerations are similar 
to those discussed in our previous paper 
(8). 
DISCUSSION 
V205-Si02 appears to be a highly selec- 
tive catalyst for HCHO formation from 
methane at low conversion. However, this 
system suffers from a rapid falloff in HCHO 
selectivity 
as methane 
conversion 
in- 
creases. Similar behavior was observed by 
Zhen et al. (5) using N20 as an oxidant with 
a V205-Si02 catalyst. With N20, however, 
methanol was also produced with signifi- 
cant selectivity. 
It has previously been reported (7, 14) 
that silica itself appears to catalyze the par- 
tial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. 
In the present study it appears that less 
than 0.1 monolayer of V205 enhances the 
methane conversion activity of the silica by 
approximately a factor of 50 at 848 K and 
5000 h- (GHSV, NTP).

The dotted lines in the Arrhenius plots 
(Figs. 4 and 6) correspond to data obtained 
for the MoOJ-Si02 catalyst. Preexponen- 
tial factors and activation energies for the 
MoOJ-Si02 system are summarized in pa- 
rentheses in Table 2. The V20s-Si02 cata- 
lyst has a much higher oxidation activity 
than Mo03-Si02. 
This was also observed 
when N20 was used as an oxidant (4, 5). 
To illustrate the differences in mecha- 
nism between the two catalysts, the formal- 
dehyde and carbon dioxide selectivities for 
the Mo03-SiOz 
catalyst are reproduced 
from (8) as Figs. 9a and b. Selectivity to 
carbon dioxide for the V205-Si02 system is 
zero at low methane conversions (Fig. lc), 
while for the Mo03-Si02 system it is inde- 
pendent of conversion at -11% (Fig. 9b).

carbon dioxide are formed directly from 
methane via parallel pathways. Both cata- 
lyst systems oxidize formaldehyde to car- 
bon monoxide, but the MoOj-SiOz catalyst 
appears to be much less active than V205-

for the conversion of CO to CO*. This 
is consistent with the work of Nozaki and 
Ohki (15) where, in the range 723-823 K, 
unsupported VZOs was found to be more 
active than Moo3 for CO oxidation. 
The effect of temperature (at constant 
conversion) on HCHO selectivity appears 
to be much more marked for V205-Si02 
(Fig. la) than in the MoOj-SiOz case (Fig. 
9a). The larger temperature dependence is a 
result of the greater difference in activation 
energies for the HCHO formation and de-

Vanadia-silica is a selective catalyst for 
the partial oxidation of methane to formal- 
dehyde at low methane conversions. As 
methane conversion increases, formalde- 
hyde selectivity decreases. At a fixed meth- 
ane conversion, formaldehyde selectivity 
can be increased by increasing tempera- 
ture. 
Kinetic analysis indicates that the meth- 
SiOz (* 848 K, 0 873 K, W 898 K, A 923 K) catalysts. ane is directly oxidized to formaldehyde, 
struction reactions (Table 2). Overall, de- 
spite the high activity of the VzO,--Si02 cat- 
alysts, HCHO yields at a given methane 
conversion are lower than in the Mo03- 
Si02 system (Fig. 10). 
MoOj-SiOz and V205-Si02 are the only 
catalyst systems studied so far that display 
such high selectivities to formaldehyde in 
the presence of molecular oxygen. It is in- 
teresting to note that, like Mo03, V205 has 
a tendency to form reduced, edge-sharing 
shear structures (16), suggesting that this 
facile mode of partial reduction may be an 
important component in the catalytic mech- 
anism. Also, as with the MoOj-Si02 
sys- 
tem, the methane oxidation 
activity 
of 
V205-Si02 is severely poisoned by sodium 
(17). This suggests that, in both cases, the 
shearing mechanism is being locked 
by 
the formation of an -0Na 
unit. This pre- 
vents the elimination of water and thereby 
the reduction of the oxide.

with formaldehyde being oxidized to car- 
bon monoxide, and carbon monoxide being 
further oxidized to carbon dioxide. The re- 
actions were all found to be zero order in 
oxygen concentration. Methane, formalde- 
hyde, and carbon monoxide oxidation were 
modeled following 
overall first-order ki- 
netic rate laws. Kinetic 
constants have 
been determined and there is good agree- 
ment between model predictions and exper- 
imental data. 
The vanadia-silica 
catalyst is clearly 
more active than the molybdena-silica 
sys- 
tem, although on V205-Si02, selectivity to 
formaldehyde appears to fall off more rap- 
idly with conversion at all but the highest 
temperatures investigated. 
The tempera- 
ture dependence is different in the two sys- 
tems, with formaldehyde selectivity vary- 
ing much more strongly with temperature 
(at a given conversion) in the Vz05-Si02 
case. A significant difference between the 
two catalysts is that unlike its molybdena 
counterpart, which forms HCHO and CO2: 
by parallel reaction pathways, vanadia-sil- 
ica catalyzes the formation of CO* via a se- 
quential mechanism.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Analyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH), discussing the interplay between various catalysts (including bulk metal oxides and supported systems), the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion, and the proposed reaction mechanisms (such as C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, and 2H-abstraction). How do these factors collectively influence the process efficiency, and what role does site isolation play in addressing selectivity issues?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
