The partial oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde can be achieved selectively on 
silica-supported vanadium pentoxide catalysts in the temperature range 460-500C in a reactant 
mixture of CH,, N20, and Hz0 at 1 atm total pressure. The selectivity to CH30H and HCHO can 
be 100% at 460C at low conversions (-0.2%) and contact time (1.2 s), and decreases to produce 
more CO with increasing temperature, contact time, and conversion. The activation energies are 22 
f 2,40 2 4, and 47 f 4 k&/mole for the production of HCHO, CHsOH, and CO, respectively. The 
rate equations are Rate (CHpOH) - (CH,)n(N,0)1Z(H20), Rate (HCHO) - (CH4)n(N20)I, and 
Rate (CO) - (CH#n(N20)(HzO)-*. 
The products form by parallel reaction paths which are differ- 
ent from the sequential oxidation mechanism of methane on molybdena and in a lower temperature 
range than on molybdenum oxide.

INTRODUCTION 
The partial catalytic oxidation of meth- 
ane to methanol or to formaldehyde pro- 
vides intriguing new opportunities for the 
production of liquid fuels and chemicals. 
Recent studies in our laboratory and else- 
where have shown that silica-supported 
molybdenum oxide appears to be a suitable 
catalyst for these processes (Z-3). In the 
temperature range of SO-580C and at 1 
atm total reactant pressure methane can be 
oxidized selectively to CHsOH and HCHO 
in the presence of N20 and Hz0 at low con- 
versions (l-2%) and at low contact times. 
The fraction of formaldehyde increases 
with increasing contact time and its activa- 
tion energy of formation is identical to that 
of CH30H at the higher temperatures. This 
indicates that formaldehyde is the product 
of a secondary reaction involving the fur- 
ther partial oxidation of methanol on the 
molybdena catalyst which is known to be 
an excellent catalyst for this reaction. 
Our continued investigation uncovered 
that silica-supported vanadium pentoxide is 
also a good catalyst for the partial oxidation 
of methane and the purpose of this paper is 
to report our findings. V205 produces 
methanol and formaldehyde selectively and 
at comparable conversions in the tempera- 
ture range of 460-500C. This is a signifi- 
cantly lower temperature range than that 
employed when using molybdenum oxide 
catalysts. The activation energies 
of HCHO 
and CH30H formation are different, 22 + 2 
and 40 -+ 
4 k&/mole, respectively, indicat- 
ing that their formation is by parallel reac- 
tion paths instead of the consecutive reac- 
tion sequence found on molybdena. The 
rates of CHJOH, HCHO, and CO produc- 
tion are all -half order in methane partial 
pressure and they also depend significantly 
on the partial pressures of NzO and HzO. 
The rate equations can be rationalized as- 
suming 
the presence of a methoxy, -0CH3, 
reaction intermediate that may hydrolyze 
to form methanol or may lose one or more 
hydrogen atoms to yield HCHO or CO. 
I After this work was completed it was brought to 
our 
attention 
that M. Iwamoto has a Japanese patent 
(Jpn. Kokai

on the partial oxidation of methane with NzO 
over a 2% V20J-Si02 catalyst using conditions 
similar 
to ours.

EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials. 
The catalyst, 
2.0% V205- 
SiOz, was prepared by impregnation from a 
basic solution of ammonium metavanadate 
at a pH of 10.5 and a subsequent drying 
followed by heating in air at 550C. The 
support, Cab-0-Sil HS-5 fumed silica, had 
a reported surface area of 350 + 25 m2 
g-l. 
The finished catalyst was pressed and sifted 
to 30-60 mesh particles. The final surface 
area, as determined by BET measurement, 
was found to be 230 + 10 
m2 
g-l. The active 
vanadium surface area was not determined, 
but it is well below the loading reported 
to be necessary for a monolayer coverage. 
The reactant gases, methane (99.9%), ni- 
trous oxide (99.0%), oxygen (99.8%), and 
the carrier gas, helium (99.9%) were used 
as received. 
Apparatus 
and methods. The fixed-bed 
reactor and the continuous flow manifold 
were the same as used in a study reported 
earlier (I). Reactant and carrier gases from 
the manifold and water vapor from a steam 
boiler were adjusted to the desired compo- 
sition and passed through the catalyst bed 
at a total flow rate of 80 cm3 mini. 
Typi- 
cally, a molar composition of 0.15 CH4, 
0.30 N20, 0.40 H20, and 0.15 He at 1 atm 
total pressure and -0.73 g (2 cm3) catalyst 
was employed for most of the experiments. 
The entire reaction manifold was heated to 
120C 
to prevent condensation of water va- 
por. The analysis of the gas mixture before 
and after reaction was carried out gas chro- 
matographically using a thermal conductiv- 
ity and a flame ionization detector. The 
reaction temperature was controlled and 
monitored with a probe thermocouple em- 
bedded in the catalyst bed. The reaction 
was initiated by flowing 80 cm3 
min- of the 
reaction mixture of a desired composition 
through the catalyst bed preset to the reac- 
tion temperature, usually between 460 and 
500C. One to two hours was allowed for 
the system to reach a steady state and be 
ready for sample analysis. 
Analytical 
procedure. 
An in-line 
gas 
chromatograph, equipped with a IO-port 
sampling valve, a flame ionization (FI) de- 
tector, a thermal conductivity 
(TC) detec- 
tor, and two analytical columns were used 
for alternate injections into the two col- 
umns, one leading to the TC detector and 
the other to the FI detector. The pre- and 
postreaction samplings were made possible 
by incorporating a six-port switching valve 
into the reaction manifold. Separation and 
detection of (N2 + OZ), CO, C02, CH4, 
N20, and Hz0 were accomplished with a 
Carbosieve S-II (Supelco) column and a TC 
detector. For CH30H, HCHO, CH4, and 
higher hydrocarbons, a Porapak-QS col- 
umn and a flame ionization detector at a 
sensitivity 
of 12 pAFS were used. For 
quantitative analysis the measured peak ar- 
eas were corrected for the molar response 
factors of the various components as re- 
ported by Dietz (4). 
The products, HCHO and CH30H, were 
collected by stripping the exit gas stream in 
a cold trap maintained at -5C. Since there

was a considerable amount of steam in the 
reaction mixture, the condensate was 
trapped in the form of an aqueous solution 
of a mixture of HCHO and CH30H with 
better than 99% efficiency. The analysis of 
the condensate was carried out gas chro- 
matographicahy as described in a previous 
paper (I) and the rates of formation of 
CH3OH and HCHO were calculated on the 
basis of the weight of the condensate col- 
lected over a timed interval. The rate of 
formation of CO was calculated as the 
product of the flux and the mole fraction of 
CO as determined by the GC analysis of the 
exit gas stream. 
The reported rate data are based on the 
assumption of a 100% dispersion of vana- 
dium over the support, since at a 2% load- 
ing, vanadium is known to have submono- 
layer coverage over a support of similar 
surface area (5). 
RESULTS 
Yield and product distribution. Figure 1 
summarizes the effects of temperature and 
contact time on the overall conversion of 
methane and the relative product distribu- 
tion of CHjOH, HCHO, and CO expressed 
as a mole percentage of the total. At a con- 
tact time of 1.2 s, the overall conversion 
varied from 0.2% at 460C 
to 0.8% at 500C. 
Both CH30H and HCHO selectivities 
dropped and CO selectivity increased with 
the increase in temperature. For example, 
at 460C CHsOH and HCHO formed with 
selectivities of 38 and 62%, respectively. 
These decreased to 16 and 36%, respec- 
tively, at 5OOC, 
while the CO selectivity 
increased 
from 0 to 48% over the same 
tem- 
perature range. No COz formation was ob- 
served at a contact time of 1.2 s over this 
temperature range. Increased contact time 
had a more adverse effect on the product 
selectivities toward CHjOH and HCHO. 
Higher temperature and contact time re- 
sulted in the formation of increased 
amounts of CO and COz at the expense of 
CH30H and HCHO. As shown in the 
hatched bar graphs in Fig. 1, the formation 
of CH3OH and HCHO were marked with 
substantially lower selectivities of 12 and 
29%, respectively, at 460C when the con- 
tact time was increased to 4.6 s. At higher 
temperatures, especially in the range of 
480-5OOC, CO was the major product, 
with an 80% selectivity. Moreover, this in- 
crease in contact time to 4.6 s even led to 
the formation of a small amount of COz, a 
product which was not detected under the 
flow conditions of a 1.2-s 
contact time. It is 
also to be noted from Fig. 1 that the overall 
conversion of CI& more than doubled with 
the increase in contact time from 1.2 to 4.6 
s. At 46OC, for example, the conversion 
increased from 0.2 to 0.8% with this in- 
crease 
in contact time but the selectivity of 
CHjOH and HCHO dropped from 38 and 
62% to 12 and 2%, respectively, with the 
increase in selectivity of CO from 0 to 59%. 
Temperatures below 460C 
were too low 
for the detection of CHJOH and HCHO 
with any reliability. Above 500C CO and 
CO:! were the predominant products and 
therefore this temperature region was not 
investigated. 
Experiments were initially performed us- 
ing 02 as the oxidant. At 500C 1.2-s con- 
tact time with oxygen alone as the oxidant 
gives greater than 80% selectivity for CO 
and CO2 with 0.7% conversion. Under the 
same conditions but with N20 as the oxi- 
dant 100% selectivity for CHsOH and 
HCHO is obtained with 0.1% conversion. 
However, a small quantity (2%) of O2 
added to the reaction mixture with N20 as 
the oxidant gives 48, 36, and 16% selectiv- 
ity for CO, HCHO, and CH3OH, respec- 
tively, with 1.0% conversion. Due to this 
enhanced conversion much of the work 
presented in this paper was performed with 
2% 02 in the reaction mixture.

of CH30H and

respectively, whereas, that of CO in- 
creased to 1.2 x 10e4 
with an overall yield 
of 1.8% at the same conditions of reactant 
composition 
and temperature. 
This in- 
creased rate of CO formation with concom- 
itant decreases in CH30H and HCHO for- 
mations as a function of increased contact 
time was reflected in the product distribu- 
tion data discussed in the previous section. 
As shown in Fig. 2, the temperature de- 
pendence of the rates of formation 
of 
CH30H, HCHO, and CO were found to 
give an Arrhenius fit within the limits of 
experimental uncertainty 
over the entire 
temperature range of 460-500C. The acti- 
vation energies were 22 -+ 2,40 ? 4, and 47 
f 4 kcal/mole for the formation of HCHO, 
CH30H, and CO, respectively. Due to the 
scatter in the data, the latter two values are 
probably not significantly distinct. 
The logarithmic plots of the various rates 
vs the mole percentage of the reactant of

The order with respect to CH4 was one- 
half for the rates of formation of all three 
products over a CH., mole% range of 3 to 
14. At lower concentrations the rate was 
too low to be measured accurately and at 
higher concentrations deactivation due to 
excessive coking was observed. For N20 
pressure dependence a N20 mole% range 
of 4 to 25 was found suitable for the mea- 
surement. CH30H, HCHO, and CO formed 
with, respectively, one-half, one-third, and 
first-order kinetics with respect to N20. 
The steam pressure dependence was, re- 
spectively, 
one-half, zero, and negative 
first. For the measurement of kinetic order 
with respect to H20, a much lower concen- 
tration of methane of 4% instead of the 
usual 13-14% was necessary to prevent 
cracking of CHa at the lower range of steam 
pressure. The slight negative dependence

on the oxygen partial 
pressure is not 
thought to be significant due to the large 
scatter of the data points. Therefore we as- 
sume that it is zero within the experimental 
error. 
DISCUSSION 
Conversion and product selectivity. It is 
worthwhile to draw a comparison between 
this and the previously reported works on 
Moo,-SiOz 
catalysts 
(1-3). 
First, 
the 
working 
range for vanadium pentoxide 
(450-500C) is comparatively 
lower and 
narrower than observed in the case of 
Moo,-SiOz catalyst, which was 480-590C 
under similar conditions at reactant com- 
position and contact time. Compared to 
Moo,-Si02, 
V205-Si02 catalyst was found 
to be more active for CH30H formation at 
the overlapping temperatures of the above 
two ranges. For instance, at 49OC, the 
turnover 
rate for CH30H formation on 
MoOj-SiO*, 0.50 x 10m4

was substantially lower than was observed 
on V 0 -St0

. s-l. The total conversion was 
also more favorable on V20s-SiO*, 0.10% 
at 2.3-s contact time on Moos-Si02 
as 
compared with 0.6% at 1.2-s contact time 
on V205-Si02 . 
. 
It appears that V205-Si02 is 
a considerably stronger oxidizing catalyst 
than Mo03-Si02, 
which has the favorable 
consequence of lower operating tempera- 
ture. However, V205-Si02 has an unfavor- 
able product selectivity toward CH30H. 
Kinetics and mechanisms. A comparison 
of the rate laws of various product forma- 
tions and activation energies is provided in 
Table 2. In our previous report on Mo03- 
SiOZ 
(I), the two E, values for HCHO were 
ascribed to two different mechanisms, a 
low-temperature path leading to the HCHO 
formation 
simultaneously 
with 
CH30H 
from the same intermediate with an activa- 
tion energy of 82 + 2 kcal/mole, and a 
lower-activation-energy, 
high-temperature 
process involving 
further 
oxidation 
of 
CHjOH. 
For the methane oxidation

seems to be entirely different. Even though 
the E, for CHJOH formation is very simi- 
lar (40 kcal/mole) to that on Mo03, the acti- 
vation energy for HCHO is substantially 
lower. Furthermore, there is no evidence 
for any consecutive oxidation of CH30H 
leading to HCHO or CO. 
Although we cannot rule out mechanisms 
with branched or sequential reactions, the 
simplest mechanism that fits our kinetic 
data is one involving parallel reaction paths 
for the formation of CH,OH, HCHO, and 
CO on the V205-Si02 catalysts. 
Speculation on the reaction mechanisms. 
The chemisorption of methane which oc- 
curs with a very low reaction probability 
produces a methoxy group, CH30-, and a 
hydroxyl group. Hydrolysis of the methoxy 
group by water yields methanol and an- 
other hydroxyl group on the vanadium ox- 
ide surface. However, CH30 can also un- 
dergo sequential loss of hydrogen atoms to 
produce HCHO and CO molecules which 
then desorb. Dehydroxylation 
of the oxide 
surface can occur by oxidative elimination 
with the help of dissociatively chemisorbed 
N20. The reaction is also likely to be struc- 
ture sensitive as there are several different 
oxygen sites on the different vanadium ox- 
ide crystal surfaces. These are likely to 
show different activity toward the produc-
