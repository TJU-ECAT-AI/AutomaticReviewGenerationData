[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds"

[2] "The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts"

[3] "The invariance of the TOF for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/TiO2 as a function of surface vanadia coverage also suggests that only one surface vanadia site is required for this reaction"

[4] "The propylene selectivity during propane oxidative dehydrogenation is enhanced by the presence of basic interacting additives"

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and structure. Based on the provided information:

1. Catalyst type affects the reaction mechanism. On V2O5/Nb2O5, the concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds does not impact the reaction, suggesting a mechanism not dependent on these sites.

2. Support material plays a role. On V2O5/Al2O3, increasing surface vanadia coverage enhances TOF, indicating that factors beyond simple site density are important.

3. Site requirements vary. For V2O5/TiO2, the invariant TOF with surface coverage suggests only one vanadia site is needed, demonstrating how different supports can lead to different site requirements.

4. Additives influence selectivity. Basic interacting additives enhance propylene selectivity, showing how modifying the catalyst environment can tune product distribution.

5. Site isolation is not directly addressed, but the varying site requirements across different catalysts suggest it may be important for some systems.

These observations highlight the complex interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction efficiency in ODH processes. The differing behaviors on various supports and with different additives underscore the importance of careful catalyst design to optimize selectivity and conversion.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）受到与催化剂组成和结构相关的多种因素的影响。根据提供的信息：

1. 催化剂类型影响反应机理。在V2O5/Nb2O5上，桥接V-O-V键的浓度不影响反应，这表明反应机理不依赖于这些位点。

2. 载体材料起着重要作用。在V2O5/Al2O3上，增加表面钒氧化物覆盖率会提高TOF，表明除了简单的位点密度之外，还有其他重要因素。

3. 位点要求各不相同。对于V2O5/TiO2，TOF与表面覆盖率无关，表明只需要一个钒氧化物位点，这展示了不同载体如何导致不同的位点要求。

4. 添加剂影响选择性。碱性相互作用添加剂提高了丙烯选择性，显示了如何通过修改催化剂环境来调节产物分布。

5. 虽然没有直接讨论位点隔离，但不同催化剂上不同的位点要求表明，对某些系统来说，位点隔离可能很重要。

这些观察结果突出了ODH过程中催化剂组成、结构和反应效率之间的复杂相互作用。在不同载体上和不同添加剂存在下的不同行为强调了仔细设计催化剂以优化选择性和转化率的重要性。
