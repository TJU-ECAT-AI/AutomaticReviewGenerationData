[1] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."

[2] "Isolated sites are beneficial for propylene selectivity, but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which the hydrocarbons can be adsorbed and further oxidized to COx."

[3] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[4] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."

[5] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."

[6] "In the case of propane ODH, turnover frequency (TOF) values vary by more than an order of magnitude with the specific oxide support for both the isolated and polymeric surface VOx species."

[7] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, presenting challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. 

Catalysts for ODH include bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being extensively studied. The performance of these catalysts is highly dependent on their structure and composition. For supported systems, the active phase loading plays a crucial role, with optimal performance often observed at intermediate loadings corresponding to monolayer coverage.

The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation as a key step. For vanadium-based catalysts, a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism is proposed, where lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation. The process involves the formation of alkyl intermediates, which then desorb as olefins. The catalyst is subsequently re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Site isolation is a critical factor in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated active sites are generally more selective for olefin production, but a balance must be struck as they may not provide complete coverage of the support surface, leading to undesired oxidation reactions.

The support material significantly influences catalyst performance, affecting both activity and selectivity. The interaction between the active phase and the support can modify the electronic properties of the active sites, impacting their reactivity.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a major challenge in ODH. The process efficiency is influenced by factors such as reaction temperature, catalyst composition, support material, and reactor design. Researchers continue to explore novel catalyst formulations and reactor configurations to overcome these challenges and improve the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，在同时实现高选择性和高转化率方面存在挑战。

ODH的催化剂包括bulk金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中钒和钼氧化物被广泛研究。这些催化剂的性能高度依赖于它们的结构和组成。对于负载型系统，活性相的负载量起着关键作用，最佳性能通常在对应于单层覆盖的中等负载量时观察到。

反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化作为关键步骤。对于基于钒的催化剂，提出了Mars-van Krevelen redox机制，其中晶格氧参与C-H键活化。该过程涉及烷基中间体的形成，然后脱附为烯烃。随后，催化剂被气相氧再次氧化。

位点隔离是解决选择性问题的关键因素。孤立的活性位点通常对烯烃生产更具选择性，但必须取得平衡，因为它们可能无法提供支持表面的完全覆盖，导致不期望的氧化反应。

载体材料显著影响催化剂性能，影响活性和选择性。活性相和载体之间的相互作用可以改变活性位点的电子性质，影响其反应性。

同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是ODH的主要挑战。过程效率受到反应温度、催化剂组成、载体材料和反应器设计等因素的影响。研究人员继续探索新型催化剂配方和反应器配置，以克服这些挑战并提高ODH过程的整体效率。
