[3] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[4] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by a complex interplay of factors related to catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions:

1. Catalyst types: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides are among the most studied catalysts. The support material and loading of the active phase significantly affect performance.

2. Selectivity and conversion challenges: Achieving high selectivity to olefins while maintaining high conversion is a major challenge. Over-oxidation of the desired olefin product to COx is a common issue. Balancing the redox properties of the catalyst is crucial.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen is widely accepted for C-H bond activation. This involves the formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent 2H-abstraction to form the olefin. The extent of surface reduction affects selectivity.

4. Process efficiency: This is influenced by factors such as catalyst composition, surface area, active site density, and reaction conditions (temperature, feed composition). Optimizing these parameters is key to improving yields.

5. Site isolation: Isolating active sites through techniques like isomorphous substitution into microporous/mesoporous materials or controlled dispersion on supports helps improve selectivity by preventing over-oxidation reactions.

The overall efficiency of the ODH process is thus determined by carefully balancing these various factors to maximize olefin yield while minimizing undesired side reactions.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction mechanisms, presenting challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. 

Catalysts for ODH include bulk metal oxides and supported systems, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being extensively studied. The performance of these catalysts is highly dependent on their structure and composition. For supported systems, the active phase loading plays a crucial role, with optimal performance often observed at intermediate loadings corresponding to monolayer coverage.

The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation as a key step. For vanadium-based catalysts, a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism is proposed, where lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation. The process involves the formation of alkyl intermediates, which then desorb as olefins. The catalyst is subsequently re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Site isolation is a critical factor in addressing selectivity issues. Isolated active sites are generally more selective for olefin production, but a balance must be struck as they may not provide complete coverage of the support surface, leading to undesired oxidation reactions.

The support material significantly influences catalyst performance, affecting both activity and selectivity. The interaction between the active phase and the support can modify the electronic properties of the active sites, impacting their reactivity.

Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously remains a major challenge in ODH. The process efficiency is influenced by factors such as reaction temperature, catalyst composition, support material, and reactor design. Researchers continue to explore novel catalyst formulations and reactor configurations to overcome these challenges and improve the overall efficiency of the ODH process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂和反应机理之间的复杂相互作用，在同时实现高选择性和高转化率方面存在挑战。

ODH的催化剂包括bulk金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中钒和钼氧化物被广泛研究。这些催化剂的性能高度依赖于它们的结构和组成。对于负载型系统，活性相的负载量起着关键作用，最佳性能通常在对应于单层覆盖的中等负载量时观察到。

反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化作为关键步骤。对于基于钒的催化剂，提出了Mars-van Krevelen redox机制，其中晶格氧参与C-H键活化。该过程涉及烷基中间体的形成，然后脱附为烯烃。随后，催化剂被气相氧再次氧化。

位点隔离是解决选择性问题的关键因素。孤立的活性位点通常对烯烃生产更具选择性，但必须取得平衡，因为它们可能无法提供支持表面的完全覆盖，导致不期望的氧化反应。

载体材料显著影响催化剂性能，影响活性和选择性。活性相和载体之间的相互作用可以改变活性位点的电子性质，影响其反应性。

同时实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是ODH的主要挑战。过程效率受到反应温度、催化剂组成、载体材料和反应器设计等因素的影响。研究人员继续探索新型催化剂配方和反应器配置，以克服这些挑战并提高ODH过程的整体效率。

[1] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:
(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C. Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction conditions to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Two main approaches are used: high-temperature combustion/dehydrogenation (>700°C) and lower-temperature true ODH with redox catalysts (<500°C).

Vanadium and molybdenum oxides are the most widely studied catalysts, both as bulk and supported systems. The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation through a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle, where lattice oxygen participates in forming alkyl intermediates that then desorb as olefins. 

A major challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity while maintaining good conversion. Site isolation has emerged as a key strategy to improve selectivity by preventing over-oxidation. This is often accomplished by incorporating active metal species into microporous or mesoporous supports.

Several catalyst systems have shown promising performance, including NiO-based catalysts (e.g. NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O) and mixed metal oxides containing Mo, V, Nb, etc. The specific composition and structure of these catalysts influence their redox properties, acidity, and ability to activate C-H bonds selectively.

Overall, optimizing ODH catalysts requires carefully balancing factors like active site density, redox properties, support interactions, and reaction conditions. Site isolation remains an important principle for addressing selectivity issues, but must be balanced with maintaining sufficient activity. Continued research into novel catalyst compositions and structures may yield further improvements in ODH efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用,以实现高选择性和转化率。主要使用两种方法:高温燃烧/脱氢(>700°C)和使用氧化还原催化剂的低温真正ODH(<500°C)。

钒和钼氧化物是研究最广泛的催化剂,既有块状也有负载型系统。反应机理通常涉及通过Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环进行C-H键活化,其中晶格氧参与形成烷基中间体,然后脱附为烯烃。

ODH的一个主要挑战是在保持良好转化率的同时实现高选择性。位点隔离已成为提高选择性的一个关键策略,可防止过度氧化。这通常通过将活性金属物种掺入微孔或介孔载体来实现。

几种催化剂体系显示出良好的性能,包括基于NiO的催化剂(如NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O)和含Mo、V、Nb等的混合金属氧化物。这些催化剂的具体组成和结构影响其氧化还原性质、酸度以及选择性活化C-H键的能力。

总的来说,优化ODH催化剂需要仔细平衡活性位点密度、氧化还原性质、载体相互作用和反应条件等因素。位点隔离仍然是解决选择性问题的重要原则,但必须与保持足够的活性相平衡。对新型催化剂组成和结构的持续研究可能会进一步提高ODH效率。

[1] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes  by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."

[2] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and reaction conditions. The interplay between different catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, significantly impacts the efficiency of the ODH process.

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are widely studied for alkane ODH. Their activity increases with V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved at intermediate domain sizes, balancing activity and accessibility. The reaction mechanism involves C-H bond dissociation and follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle using lattice oxygen.

Molybdenum oxide-based catalysts are generally less active than vanadium-based ones but still play an important role in ODH reactions. Other catalysts showing outstanding performance include NiO-based systems and mixed molybdates.

A major challenge in alkane ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is partly due to the tendency of the desired olefin products to undergo further oxidation. Site isolation has been identified as a key strategy to address selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, catalysts can potentially limit undesired secondary reactions.

The reaction mechanisms proposed for alkane ODH typically involve C-H bond activation as a crucial step. This may proceed through the formation of M-alkyl intermediates or via a 2H-abstraction process. The specific mechanism can vary depending on the catalyst system and reaction conditions.

Overall, the efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the nature of the catalyst (composition, structure, and support), reaction conditions (temperature, reactant ratios), and the inherent reactivity of the alkane substrate and olefin product. Balancing these factors to achieve high selectivity and conversion remains a significant challenge in the field.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being the most investigated. Supported systems often show better performance due to improved dispersion of active sites.

Reaction mechanisms: The process typically involves C-H bond activation through a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism. Lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond cleavage, forming alkyl intermediates that desorb as olefins. Reduced metal centers are then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult due to over-oxidation of desired products. Controlling the strength of metal-oxygen bonds is crucial - they must be strong enough to activate the alkane but weak enough to allow product desorption.

Site isolation: This is a key strategy for improving selectivity. Isolating active sites, such as by incorporating metal species into microporous or mesoporous materials, helps prevent unwanted side reactions and over-oxidation.

Process efficiency: It is influenced by the choice of catalyst, reaction temperature, and reactor design. Lower temperature ODH (around 500°C) with redox catalysts is generally preferred over high-temperature (>700°C) approaches combining combustion and dehydrogenation.

The VOx-SBA-15 system exemplifies how these factors can be optimized, providing accessible, isolated active sites that lead to improved catalytic performance in propane ODH. Overall, the challenge lies in balancing these various factors to achieve high olefin yields while minimizing unwanted oxidation products.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多种因素之间的复杂相互作用：

催化剂：使用块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中钒和钼氧化物是研究最多的。由于活性位点分散性更好，负载型系统通常表现更优异。

反应机理：该过程通常涉及通过Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制激活C-H键。晶格氧参与C-H键的断裂，形成烷基中间体，然后脱附成烯烃。还原的金属中心随后被气相氧再氧化。

挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率很困难，因为目标产物容易被过度氧化。控制金属-氧键的强度至关重要 - 它们必须足够强以激活烷烃，但又要足够弱以允许产物脱附。

位点隔离：这是提高选择性的关键策略。隔离活性位点，例如将金属物种掺入微孔或介孔材料中，有助于防止不需要的副反应和过度氧化。

过程效率：受催化剂选择、反应温度和反应器设计的影响。通常更倾向于使用氧化还原催化剂在较低温度（约500°C）下进行ODH，而不是高温（>700°C）下结合燃烧和脱氢的方法。

VOx-SBA-15系统展示了如何优化这些因素，提供可接近的、隔离的活性位点，从而在丙烷ODH中实现更好的催化性能。总的来说，挑战在于平衡这些因素，以实现高烯烃产率，同时最小化不需要的氧化产物。
