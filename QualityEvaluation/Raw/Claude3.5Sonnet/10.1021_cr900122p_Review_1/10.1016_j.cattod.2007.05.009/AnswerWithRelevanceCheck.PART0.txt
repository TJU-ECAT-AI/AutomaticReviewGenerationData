          [1] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[2] "The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."

[3] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."

[4] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[5] "ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UVvisible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes."

[6] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[7] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:
(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C. Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."

[8] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO), and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)"

[9] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and process conditions. The main catalysts studied are based on vanadium and molybdenum oxides, both as bulk and supported systems. The reaction typically follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkyl intermediates that desorb as olefins.

The process efficiency is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition and structure: Supported vanadium oxides, NiO-based systems, and mixed molybdates show promising performance. The VOx-SBA-15 system is particularly effective due to its high concentration of isolated, accessible active sites.

2. Reaction mechanism: The dissociation of C-H bonds is a key step, often occurring through a redox cycle involving lattice oxygen.

3. Site isolation: This is crucial for improving selectivity by preventing over-oxidation of desired products.

4. Surface reduction: Higher surface reduction tends to increase selectivity to olefins.

5. Electronic properties: ODH turnover rates are related to the electronic transitions of the catalyst, as observed in UV-visible spectra.

6. Temperature: Two approaches are used - high-temperature combustion/dehydrogenation (>700°C) and lower-temperature true ODH with redox catalysts (<500°C).

The challenge lies in balancing these factors to achieve high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. Site isolation plays a significant role in addressing selectivity issues by limiting unwanted secondary reactions. However, it must be balanced with maintaining sufficient activity. Strategies such as isomorphous substitution of active metal species into microporous and mesoporous materials are being explored to optimize catalyst design and improve overall process efficiency.

          烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及各种催化剂、反应机理和工艺条件之间的复杂相互作用。主要研究的催化剂是基于钒和钼氧化物的，既有块状也有负载型系统。反应通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制，其中晶格氧参与C-H键活化，形成烷基中间体，然后脱附为烯烃。

过程效率受到几个因素的影响：

1. 催化剂组成和结构：负载型钒氧化物、基于NiO的系统和混合钼酸盐显示出良好的性能。VOx-SBA-15系统由于其高浓度的孤立、可接近的活性位点而特别有效。

2. 反应机理：C-H键的断裂是关键步骤，通常通过涉及晶格氧的氧化还原循环发生。

3. 位点隔离：这对于通过防止所需产物过度氧化来提高选择性至关重要。

4. 表面还原：较高的表面还原程度往往会增加对烯烃的选择性。

5. 电子性质：ODH转化率与催化剂的电子跃迁相关，这在紫外-可见光谱中可以观察到。

6. 温度：使用两种方法 - 高温燃烧/脱氢（>700°C）和使用氧化还原催化剂的低温真正ODH（<500°C）。

挑战在于平衡这些因素以同时实现高选择性和高转化率。位点隔离通过限制不需要的二次反应在解决选择性问题方面发挥重要作用。然而，它必须与保持足够的活性相平衡。正在探索将活性金属物种同晶取代进入微孔和介孔材料等策略，以优化催化剂设计并提高整体过程效率。
