[1] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:
(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C. Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."

[2] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation. The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."

[3] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."

[4] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO), and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various catalysts and reaction conditions to achieve high selectivity and conversion. Two main approaches are used: high-temperature combustion/dehydrogenation (>700°C) and lower-temperature true ODH with redox catalysts (<500°C).

Vanadium and molybdenum oxides are the most widely studied catalysts, both as bulk and supported systems. The reaction mechanism typically involves C-H bond activation through a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle, where lattice oxygen participates in forming alkyl intermediates that then desorb as olefins. 

A major challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity while maintaining good conversion. Site isolation has emerged as a key strategy to improve selectivity by preventing over-oxidation. This is often accomplished by incorporating active metal species into microporous or mesoporous supports.

Several catalyst systems have shown promising performance, including NiO-based catalysts (e.g. NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O) and mixed metal oxides containing Mo, V, Nb, etc. The specific composition and structure of these catalysts influence their redox properties, acidity, and ability to activate C-H bonds selectively.

Overall, optimizing ODH catalysts requires carefully balancing factors like active site density, redox properties, support interactions, and reaction conditions. Site isolation remains an important principle for addressing selectivity issues, but must be balanced with maintaining sufficient activity. Continued research into novel catalyst compositions and structures may yield further improvements in ODH efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)涉及各种催化剂和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用,以实现高选择性和转化率。主要使用两种方法:高温燃烧/脱氢(>700°C)和使用氧化还原催化剂的低温真正ODH(<500°C)。

钒和钼氧化物是研究最广泛的催化剂,既有块状也有负载型系统。反应机理通常涉及通过Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环进行C-H键活化,其中晶格氧参与形成烷基中间体,然后脱附为烯烃。

ODH的一个主要挑战是在保持良好转化率的同时实现高选择性。位点隔离已成为提高选择性的一个关键策略,可防止过度氧化。这通常通过将活性金属物种掺入微孔或介孔载体来实现。

几种催化剂体系显示出良好的性能,包括基于NiO的催化剂(如NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O)和含Mo、V、Nb等的混合金属氧化物。这些催化剂的具体组成和结构影响其氧化还原性质、酸度以及选择性活化C-H键的能力。

总的来说,优化ODH催化剂需要仔细平衡活性位点密度、氧化还原性质、载体相互作用和反应条件等因素。位点隔离仍然是解决选择性问题的重要原则,但必须与保持足够的活性相平衡。对新型催化剂组成和结构的持续研究可能会进一步提高ODH效率。
