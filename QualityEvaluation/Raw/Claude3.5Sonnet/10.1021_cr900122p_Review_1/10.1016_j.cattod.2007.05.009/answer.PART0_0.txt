[1] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[2] "ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UVvisible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes."

[3] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[4] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites"

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is influenced by a complex interplay of factors related to catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions:

1. Catalyst types: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used. Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides are among the most studied catalysts. The support material and loading of the active phase significantly affect performance.

2. Selectivity and conversion challenges: Achieving high selectivity to olefins while maintaining high conversion is a major challenge. Over-oxidation of the desired olefin product to COx is a common issue. Balancing the redox properties of the catalyst is crucial.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen is widely accepted for C-H bond activation. This involves the formation of M-alkyl intermediates and subsequent 2H-abstraction to form the olefin. The extent of surface reduction affects selectivity.

4. Process efficiency: This is influenced by factors such as catalyst composition, surface area, active site density, and reaction conditions (temperature, feed composition). Optimizing these parameters is key to improving yields.

5. Site isolation: Isolating active sites through techniques like isomorphous substitution into microporous/mesoporous materials or controlled dispersion on supports helps improve selectivity by preventing over-oxidation reactions.

The overall efficiency of the ODH process is thus determined by carefully balancing these various factors to maximize olefin yield while minimizing undesired side reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)受到与催化剂组成、结构和反应条件相关的复杂因素相互作用的影响：

1. 催化剂类型：使用了体相金属氧化物和负载型系统。负载型钒和钼氧化物是研究最多的催化剂。载体材料和活性相的负载量显著影响性能。

2. 选择性和转化率挑战：在保持高转化率的同时实现对烯烃的高选择性是一个主要挑战。所需烯烃产物过度氧化为COx是一个常见问题。平衡催化剂的氧化还原性质至关重要。

3. 反应机理：涉及晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理被广泛接受用于C-H键活化。这涉及M-烷基中间体的形成和随后的2H-抽提以形成烯烃。表面还原程度影响选择性。

4. 过程效率：这受到诸如催化剂组成、表面积、活性位点密度和反应条件（温度、进料组成）等因素的影响。优化这些参数是提高产率的关键。

5. 位点隔离：通过同晶取代进入微孔/介孔材料或在载体上控制分散等技术来隔离活性位点，有助于通过防止过度氧化反应来提高选择性。

因此，ODH过程的整体效率是通过仔细平衡这些各种因素来确定的，以最大化烯烃产率，同时最小化不希望的副反应。
