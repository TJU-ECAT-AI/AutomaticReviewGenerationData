[1] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes  by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."

[2] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[3] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[4] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[5] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites."

[6] "More specifically, in the case of molybdena-based systems: 1. In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based catalysts, regardless of the support used"

[7] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO), and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)"

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a complex process influenced by various factors related to catalyst composition and reaction conditions. The interplay between different catalysts, including bulk metal oxides and supported systems, significantly impacts the efficiency of the ODH process.

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are widely studied for alkane ODH. Their activity increases with V2O5 loading, but optimal performance is achieved at intermediate domain sizes, balancing activity and accessibility. The reaction mechanism involves C-H bond dissociation and follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox cycle using lattice oxygen.

Molybdenum oxide-based catalysts are generally less active than vanadium-based ones but still play an important role in ODH reactions. Other catalysts showing outstanding performance include NiO-based systems and mixed molybdates.

A major challenge in alkane ODH is achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. This is partly due to the tendency of the desired olefin products to undergo further oxidation. Site isolation has been identified as a key strategy to address selectivity issues. By isolating active sites, catalysts can potentially limit undesired secondary reactions.

The reaction mechanisms proposed for alkane ODH typically involve C-H bond activation as a crucial step. This may proceed through the formation of M-alkyl intermediates or via a 2H-abstraction process. The specific mechanism can vary depending on the catalyst system and reaction conditions.

Overall, the efficiency of the ODH process is collectively influenced by the nature of the catalyst (composition, structure, and support), reaction conditions (temperature, reactant ratios), and the inherent reactivity of the alkane substrate and olefin product. Balancing these factors to achieve high selectivity and conversion remains a significant challenge in the field.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)是一个复杂的过程,受到与催化剂组成和反应条件相关的各种因素的影响。不同催化剂之间的相互作用,包括大块金属氧化物和负载型系统,对ODH过程的效率有显著影响。

钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃ODH中被广泛研究。它们的活性随V2O5负载量的增加而增加,但在中等域大小时达到最佳性能,平衡了活性和可及性。反应机理涉及C-H键断裂,并遵循使用晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原循环。

钼氧化物基催化剂的活性通常低于钒基催化剂,但在ODH反应中仍然发挥重要作用。其他表现出色的催化剂包括基于NiO的系统和混合钼酸盐。

烷烃ODH的一个主要挑战是同时实现高选择性和高转化率。这部分是由于所需的烯烃产物容易进一步氧化。已确定站点隔离是解决选择性问题的关键策略。通过隔离活性位点,催化剂可能限制不希望的二次反应。

烷烃ODH提出的反应机理通常涉及C-H键活化作为关键步骤。这可能通过形成M-烷基中间体或通过2H-抽提过程进行。具体机理可能因催化剂系统和反应条件而异。

总的来说,ODH过程的效率受到催化剂性质(成分、结构和载体)、反应条件(温度、反应物比例)以及烷烃底物和烯烃产物固有反应性的共同影响。平衡这些因素以实现高选择性和高转化率仍然是该领域的重大挑战。
