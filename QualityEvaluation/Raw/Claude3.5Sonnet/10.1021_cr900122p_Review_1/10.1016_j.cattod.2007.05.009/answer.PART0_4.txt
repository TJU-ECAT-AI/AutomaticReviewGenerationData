Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:
(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at temperatures lower than 500 8C. Amongst the catalysts used, the most investigated ones are those based either on vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide."

[2] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation. The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2."

[3] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."

[4] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes involves a complex interplay between various factors:

Catalysts: Both bulk metal oxides and supported systems are used, with vanadium and molybdenum oxides being the most investigated. Supported systems often show better performance due to improved dispersion of active sites.

Reaction mechanisms: The process typically involves C-H bond activation through a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism. Lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond cleavage, forming alkyl intermediates that desorb as olefins. Reduced metal centers are then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Challenges: Achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously is difficult due to over-oxidation of desired products. Controlling the strength of metal-oxygen bonds is crucial - they must be strong enough to activate the alkane but weak enough to allow product desorption.

Site isolation: This is a key strategy for improving selectivity. Isolating active sites, such as by incorporating metal species into microporous or mesoporous materials, helps prevent unwanted side reactions and over-oxidation.

Process efficiency: It is influenced by the choice of catalyst, reaction temperature, and reactor design. Lower temperature ODH (around 500°C) with redox catalysts is generally preferred over high-temperature (>700°C) approaches combining combustion and dehydrogenation.

The VOx-SBA-15 system exemplifies how these factors can be optimized, providing accessible, isolated active sites that lead to improved catalytic performance in propane ODH. Overall, the challenge lies in balancing these various factors to achieve high olefin yields while minimizing unwanted oxidation products.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及多种因素之间的复杂相互作用：

催化剂：使用块状金属氧化物和负载型系统，其中钒和钼氧化物是研究最多的。由于活性位点分散性更好，负载型系统通常表现更优异。

反应机理：该过程通常涉及通过Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制激活C-H键。晶格氧参与C-H键的断裂，形成烷基中间体，然后脱附成烯烃。还原的金属中心随后被气相氧再氧化。

挑战：同时实现高选择性和高转化率很困难，因为目标产物容易被过度氧化。控制金属-氧键的强度至关重要 - 它们必须足够强以激活烷烃，但又要足够弱以允许产物脱附。

位点隔离：这是提高选择性的关键策略。隔离活性位点，例如将金属物种掺入微孔或介孔材料中，有助于防止不需要的副反应和过度氧化。

过程效率：受催化剂选择、反应温度和反应器设计的影响。通常更倾向于使用氧化还原催化剂在较低温度（约500°C）下进行ODH，而不是高温（>700°C）下结合燃烧和脱氢的方法。

VOx-SBA-15系统展示了如何优化这些因素，提供可接近的、隔离的活性位点，从而在丙烷ODH中实现更好的催化性能。总的来说，挑战在于平衡这些因素，以实现高烯烃产率，同时最小化不需要的氧化产物。
