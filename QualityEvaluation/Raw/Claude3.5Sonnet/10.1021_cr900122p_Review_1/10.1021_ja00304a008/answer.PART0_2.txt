[1] "Ethane and ethylene (C2 compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion of CH4 over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 °C."

[2] "Below 700 °C CO and CO2 are produced by reactions of CH3. with either surface O2- ions or gaseous O2. The latter reaction leads to chain reactions in which additional methyl radicals are generated."

[3] "The Li-promoted MgO contains no transition metals; thus it is a new type of oxidation catalyst on which thermally generated O- ions activate methane."

[4] "EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li+O-] centers probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH4."

[5] "Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO2, are produced via CH3.; the coupling of two CH3. leads to C2H6, which is partly oxidized to C2H4."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) over Li-promoted MgO catalysts demonstrates several key aspects of the process:

1. Catalyst composition: The Li/MgO system is a novel oxidation catalyst that does not contain transition metals. Instead, it relies on thermally generated O- ions to activate methane.

2. Selectivity and conversion: High selectivity (50%) for C2 compounds (ethane and ethylene) can be achieved at relatively high conversion (38%) using 7 wt% Li-promoted MgO at 720 °C.

3. Reaction mechanism: The process involves multiple steps:
   a. CH4 activation by [Li+O-] centers, which abstract a hydrogen atom to form methyl radicals (CH3.).
   b. Coupling of methyl radicals to form ethane (C2H6).
   c. Partial oxidation of ethane to ethylene (C2H4).

4. Challenges in selectivity: CO and CO2 formation competes with C2 production, especially at higher temperatures (above 700 °C). These undesired products are formed through two main pathways:
   a. Reactions of CH3. with surface O2- ions.
   b. Gas-phase reactions of CH3. with O2, leading to chain reactions that generate additional methyl radicals.

5. Site isolation: The Li+ ions in the MgO matrix create isolated active sites ([Li+O-] centers) that are crucial for selective C-H bond activation. This site isolation helps improve selectivity by limiting over-oxidation.

6. Temperature effects: Both conversion and C2 selectivity increase with temperature up to about 700 °C. Above this temperature, further oxidation becomes significant, leading to decreased C2 selectivity.

7. Surface area effects: Lower surface areas favor higher C2 selectivities by reducing the number of surface O2- ions available for complete oxidation of methyl radicals.

The Li/MgO system demonstrates how careful catalyst design can address selectivity issues in ODH reactions. By creating isolated active sites and controlling reaction conditions, it is possible to achieve relatively high conversions and selectivities for desired C2 products. However, the challenge of competing oxidation pathways remains, highlighting the need for continued research in catalyst development and process optimization for ODH reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）在锂促进的氧化镁催化剂上展示了该过程的几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂组成：Li/MgO体系是一种新型的氧化催化剂，不含过渡金属。相反，它依赖于热生成的O-离子来活化甲烷。

2. 选择性和转化率：在720 °C下使用7 wt%锂促进的氧化镁，可以在相对较高的转化率（38%）下实现C2化合物（乙烷和乙烯）的高选择性（50%）。

3. 反应机理：该过程涉及多个步骤：
   a. CH4被[Li+O-]中心活化，通过吸取氢原子形成甲基自由基（CH3.）。
   b. 甲基自由基耦合形成乙烷（C2H6）。
   c. 乙烷部分氧化成乙烯（C2H4）。

4. 选择性挑战：CO和CO2的形成与C2产物的生成竞争，尤其是在较高温度（700 °C以上）下。这些不desired产物主要通过两种途径形成：
   a. CH3.与表面O2-离子的反应。
   b. CH3.与O2的气相反应，导致产生额外甲基自由基的链式反应。

5. 位点隔离：氧化镁基质中的Li+离子创造了孤立的活性位点（[Li+O-]中心），这对于选择性C-H键活化至关重要。这种位点隔离有助于通过限制过度氧化来提高选择性。

6. 温度效应：转化率和C2选择性随温度升高而增加，直到约700 °C。超过这个温度，进一步氧化变得显著，导致C2选择性下降。

7. 表面积效应：较低的表面积有利于更高的C2选择性，因为它减少了可用于甲基自由基完全氧化的表面O2-离子数量。

Li/MgO系统展示了如何通过精心设计催化剂来解决ODH反应中的选择性问题。通过创建孤立的活性位点和控制反应条件，可以实现较高的转化率和所desired C2产物的选择性。然而，竞争性氧化途径的挑战仍然存在，突出了在ODH反应的催化剂开发和过程优化方面继续研究的必要性。
