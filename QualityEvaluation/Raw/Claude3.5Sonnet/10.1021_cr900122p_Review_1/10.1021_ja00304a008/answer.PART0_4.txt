[1] "Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen in a conventional flow reactor. Ethane and ethylene (C, compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion of CHI over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 OC."

[2] "EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li'O-] centers probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH,."

[3] "Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO,, are produced via CH,.;"

[4] "Below 700 "C CO and CO, are produced by reactions of CH3. with either surface 0,- ions or gaseous 0,. The latter reaction leads to chain reactions in which additional methyl radicals are generated."

[5] "The Li-promoted MgO contains no transition metals; thus it is a new type of oxidation catalyst on which thermally generated 0- ions activate methane."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) using Li-promoted MgO catalysts demonstrates an interesting interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways. This system achieves relatively high selectivity and conversion for C2 products from methane oxidation.

The key active sites are [Li'O-] centers, which abstract hydrogen from methane to form methyl radicals. These radicals then couple to form ethane, or react further to produce ethylene. The absence of transition metals makes this a novel type of oxidation catalyst relying on thermally generated O- ions.

The main challenge in achieving high selectivity is controlling the subsequent reactions of methyl radicals. While coupling leads to desired C2 products, reactions with surface O2- or gas-phase O2 produce undesired CO and CO2. Lower surface areas help improve C2 selectivity by reducing sites for over-oxidation.

The proposed mechanism involves initial C-H activation by [Li'O-] to form methyl radicals. These can then follow different pathways:
1) Coupling to form C2 products 
2) Reaction with surface oxygen to form CO/CO2
3) Gas-phase reactions with O2 leading to chain reactions

Interestingly, both selectivity and conversion increase with temperature up to about 700°C, allowing relatively high yields. Above this temperature, over-oxidation becomes more significant.

The Li-MgO system demonstrates how tailoring the active sites can address selectivity issues in ODH. The [Li'O-] centers provide site isolation of active oxygen species, helping to control C-H activation while limiting deep oxidation pathways. However, controlling subsequent gas-phase reactions remains challenging for achieving very high selectivities.

Overall, this catalyst system illustrates the complex interplay between active site design, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways in ODH processes. Balancing C-H activation, radical coupling, and limiting over-oxidation pathways is key to achieving high performance.

烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)使用锂促进的氧化镁催化剂展示了催化剂组成、反应条件和机理途径之间的有趣相互作用。该系统在甲烷氧化生成C2产物方面实现了相对较高的选择性和转化率。

关键活性位点是[Li'O-]中心，它从甲烷中提取氢以形成甲基自由基。这些自由基随后耦合形成乙烷，或进一步反应生成乙烯。缺少过渡金属使其成为一种新型的氧化催化剂，依靠热生成的O-离子。

实现高选择性的主要挑战是控制甲基自由基的后续反应。虽然耦合会产生所需的C2产物，但与表面O2-或气相O2的反应会产生不需要的CO和CO2。较低的表面积有助于提高C2选择性，因为它减少了过度氧化的位点。

提出的机制涉及[Li'O-]对C-H键的初始活化以形成甲基自由基。这些自由基随后可以遵循不同的途径：
1) 耦合形成C2产物
2) 与表面氧反应形成CO/CO2
3) 与O2的气相反应导致链式反应

有趣的是，选择性和转化率都随着温度升高而增加，直到约700°C，从而允许相对较高的产率。超过这个温度，过度氧化变得更加显著。

Li-MgO系统展示了如何通过调整活性位点来解决ODH中的选择性问题。[Li'O-]中心提供了活性氧物种的位点隔离，有助于控制C-H活化，同时限制深度氧化途径。然而，控制后续的气相反应仍然是实现非常高选择性的挑战。

总的来说，这个催化剂系统说明了ODH过程中活性位点设计、反应条件和机理途径之间的复杂相互作用。平衡C-H活化、自由基耦合和限制过度氧化途径是实现高性能的关键。
