[1] "Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen in a conventional flow reactor. Ethane and ethylene (C, compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion of CHI over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 OC."

[2] "EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li'O-] centers probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH,."

[3] "Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO,, are produced via CH,.;"

[4] "The coupling of two CH3. leads to C2H,, which is partly oxidized to C2H4."

[5] "Below 700 "C CO and CO, are produced by reactions of CH3. with either surface 0,- ions or gaseous 0,. The latter reaction leads to chain reactions in which additional methyl radicals are generated."

[6] "The Li-promoted MgO contains no transition metals; thus it is a new type of oxidation catalyst on which thermally generated 0- ions activate methane."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) over Li-promoted MgO catalysts demonstrates a unique approach to achieving high selectivity and conversion for C2 products. This system addresses several key challenges in ODH:

1. Catalyst composition: The Li-promoted MgO catalyst represents a departure from traditional transition metal-based catalysts, utilizing thermally generated O- ions to activate methane. This non-transition metal system offers a new paradigm in oxidation catalysis.

2. Selectivity and conversion: The catalyst achieves 50% selectivity for C2 compounds at 38% methane conversion, which is a significant improvement over previous systems. This balance between selectivity and conversion is crucial for process efficiency.

3. Reaction mechanism: The process involves C-H bond activation through [Li+O-] centers, which abstract hydrogen atoms from methane to form methyl radicals. These radicals then couple to form ethane, which can be further oxidized to ethylene.

4. Site isolation: The Li-promoted MgO system inherently provides site isolation for the active [Li+O-] centers, which helps control the extent of oxidation and improves selectivity towards C2 products.

5. Temperature effects: The system shows improved C2 selectivity and methane conversion with increasing temperature up to about 700°C, a unique feature that enhances process efficiency.

6. Competing reactions: CO and CO2 formation occurs through reactions of methyl radicals with surface O2- ions or gaseous O2, presenting a challenge to selectivity that is partially mitigated by the catalyst's low surface area.

7. Chain reactions: At higher O2 pressures, gas-phase chain reactions involving methylperoxy radicals can occur, potentially reducing selectivity but increasing overall conversion.

The interplay of these factors in the Li-promoted MgO system demonstrates how careful catalyst design and understanding of reaction mechanisms can address the challenges of ODH, particularly in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The role of site isolation, provided by the dispersion of Li+ in the MgO matrix, is crucial in controlling the extent of oxidation and enhancing C2 selectivity.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）在锂促进的氧化镁催化剂上展示了一种独特的方法，以实现C2产物的高选择性和转化率。这个系统解决了ODH中的几个关键挑战：

1. 催化剂组成：锂促进的氧化镁催化剂与传统的过渡金属基催化剂不同，利用热生成的O-离子来活化甲烷。这种非过渡金属系统为氧化催化提供了一种新的范式。

2. 选择性和转化率：该催化剂在38%的甲烷转化率下实现了50%的C2化合物选择性，这比之前的系统有显著改进。选择性和转化率之间的这种平衡对过程效率至关重要。

3. 反应机理：该过程涉及通过[Li+O-]中心的C-H键活化，这些中心从甲烷中提取氢原子形成甲基自由基。这些自由基然后偶联形成乙烷，乙烷可以进一步氧化成乙烯。

4. 位点隔离：锂促进的氧化镁系统本质上为活性[Li+O-]中心提供了位点隔离，这有助于控制氧化程度并提高对C2产物的选择性。

5. 温度效应：该系统显示随着温度升高到约700°C，C2选择性和甲烷转化率都有所提高，这是一个提高过程效率的独特特征。

6. 竞争反应：CO和CO2的形成是通过甲基自由基与表面O2-离子或气相O2的反应发生的，这对选择性提出了挑战，但部分通过催化剂的低表面积得到缓解。

7. 链式反应：在较高的O2压力下，涉及甲基过氧自由基的气相链式反应可能会发生，潜在地降低选择性但增加总体转化率。

这些因素在锂促进的氧化镁系统中的相互作用展示了如何通过精心的催化剂设计和对反应机理的理解来解决ODH的挑战，特别是在同时实现高选择性和高转化率方面。位点隔离的作用，由锂离子在氧化镁基质中的分散提供，在控制氧化程度和提高C2选择性方面起着关键作用。
