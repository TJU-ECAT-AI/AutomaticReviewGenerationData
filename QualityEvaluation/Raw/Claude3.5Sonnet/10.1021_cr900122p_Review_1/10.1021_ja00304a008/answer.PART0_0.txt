[1] "Lithium-promoted magnesium oxide was used as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen in a conventional flow reactor. Ethane and ethylene (C, compounds) were obtained with 50% selectivity at a 38% conversion of CHI over 4 g of 7 wt % Li-promoted MgO at 720 OC."

[2] "EPR spectroscopy revealed that [Li'O-] centers probably were the active sites responsible for initiating the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH4."

[3] "Based on kinetic analyses a mechanism has been proposed in which most of the products, including CO and CO2, are produced via CH3.; the coupling of two CH3. leads to C2H6, which is partly oxidized to C2H4."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors:

Catalysts: The study focuses on lithium-promoted magnesium oxide (Li/MgO) as a new type of oxidation catalyst for methane activation. This catalyst is unique because it does not contain transition metals, relying instead on thermally generated O- ions to activate methane.

Selectivity and Conversion: The Li/MgO catalyst achieved 50% selectivity for C2 compounds (ethane and ethylene) at 38% methane conversion at 720°C. This represents a significant improvement over previous studies, where maximum C2 yields were no more than 5%.

Reaction Mechanisms: The proposed mechanism involves several steps:
1. Formation of [Li'O-] centers, which are the active sites for hydrogen abstraction from methane.
2. Generation of methyl radicals (CH3.) from the reaction between methane and [Li'O-] centers.
3. Coupling of methyl radicals to form ethane (C2H6).
4. Partial oxidation of ethane to ethylene (C2H4).

The study also suggests that most products, including CO and CO2, are produced via methyl radicals. Additionally, gas-phase chain reactions may contribute to methyl radical formation.

Challenges and Site Isolation: The main challenge in ODH is achieving high selectivity while maintaining high conversion. The study shows that both selectivity and conversion increased with temperature up to about 700°C. The use of Li-promoted MgO helps address selectivity issues through site isolation of active [Li'O-] centers.

Process Efficiency: The efficiency of the process is influenced by several factors:
1. Oxygen partial pressure, which affects the concentration of [Li'O-] centers and the formation of CO and CO2.
2. Reaction temperature, with higher temperatures favoring C2 formation up to a point.
3. Surface area of the catalyst, with lower surface areas favoring higher C2 selectivities by reducing the reaction of methyl radicals with surface O2- ions.

In conclusion, the Li/MgO catalyst system represents a promising approach to ODH, offering improved selectivity and conversion compared to previous studies. The interplay between catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanistic pathways provides opportunities for further optimization of the process.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程：

催化剂：本研究聚焦于锂促进的氧化镁（Li/MgO）作为一种新型甲烷活化氧化催化剂。这种催化剂的独特之处在于它不含过渡金属，而是依靠热生成的O-离子来活化甲烷。

选择性和转化率：Li/MgO催化剂在720°C下实现了38%的甲烷转化率，C2化合物（乙烷和乙烯）的选择性为50%。这比之前的研究有显著改进，之前的研究中C2产物的最高产率不超过5%。

反应机理：提出的机理包括几个步骤：
1. 形成[Li'O-]中心，这是从甲烷中提取氢的活性位点。
2. 甲烷与[Li'O-]中心反应生成甲基自由基（CH3.）。
3. 甲基自由基偶联形成乙烷（C2H6）。
4. 乙烷部分氧化成乙烯（C2H4）。

研究还表明，大多数产物（包括CO和CO2）是通过甲基自由基产生的。此外，气相链式反应可能会促进甲基自由基的形成。

挑战和位点隔离：ODH的主要挑战是在保持高转化率的同时实现高选择性。研究表明，选择性和转化率都随着温度升高而增加，直到约700°C。使用锂促进的MgO通过[Li'O-]活性中心的位点隔离有助于解决选择性问题。

过程效率：过程效率受几个因素影响：
1. 氧分压，影响[Li'O-]中心的浓度和CO、CO2的形成。
2. 反应温度，较高温度有利于C2化合物的形成，但只在一定程度上。
3. 催化剂表面积，较低的表面积有利于更高的C2选择性，因为它减少了甲基自由基与表面O2-离子的反应。

总之，Li/MgO催化剂系统代表了ODH的一种有前景的方法，与之前的研究相比，它提供了更好的选择性和转化率。催化剂组成、反应条件和机理路径之间的相互作用为进一步优化过程提供了机会。
