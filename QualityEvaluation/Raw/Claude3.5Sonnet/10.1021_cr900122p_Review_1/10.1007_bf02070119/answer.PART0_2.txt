[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]. Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A1 and A2 signals, respectively, (Fig. la) at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu2+ ions, characterized by M1, M2 and D signals (Fig. la), occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H2 and/or O2 treatment at different temperatures."

[2] "Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products. The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene."

[3] "As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Figure 2b and Table ib show clearly that the conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."

[4] "Therefore, the nature and the copper site concentrations have an important role to explain this difference in both reactions. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated [4-63 that the Cu2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and CuO crystallites for Cu/Th > 0.25 ratios."

[5] "Supposing that the reaction is first order, the selectivity S in propene is given by the following equation: S = (K-1)/K (1-C)[(1-C)K-1] / (E-1) C where K=k1/k2 is the coefficient of selectivity, k1 and k2 are the rate constants of dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation of propene, respectively, and C the conversion of propane."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanisms. The study focuses on CuTh oxide catalysts for the ODH of ethane and propane.

The catalysts' performance is strongly dependent on the Cu/Th atomic ratio. Different Cu2+ species exist on the catalyst surface, including monomers, dimers, and CuO crystallites, each playing a role in the reaction. The catalytic activity generally increases with copper concentration, but the relationship between activity and selectivity is not linear.

For ethane ODH, the total conversion reached 13.5 mol%, but only 9.3 mol% was the desired ethylene product. The presence of CuO crystallites at higher Cu/Th ratios (>0.25) seems to enhance ethane conversion but may inhibit ethylene formation.

In propane ODH, the conversion is closely correlated with copper concentration up to Cu/Th ratios of 0.25, after which it remains constant. The selectivity towards propene reaches a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and then decreases for higher ratios.

The study proposes a first-order reaction model for propane ODH, introducing a selectivity coefficient K that relates the rate constants of propane dehydrogenation and propene oxidation. This model attempts to explain the observed decrease in propene selectivity as propane conversion increases.

The research highlights the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The interplay between different copper species and their concentrations on the catalyst surface significantly influences the reaction pathways and product distribution.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss site isolation, the varying performance with different Cu/Th ratios suggests that the distribution and nature of active sites play a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior. The formation of CuO crystallites at higher copper loadings may reduce the number of isolated active sites, potentially explaining the observed changes in selectivity.

Overall, the study demonstrates the complexity of ODH reactions and the importance of carefully tuning catalyst composition to optimize performance. The balance between different types of active sites, influenced by copper concentration and distribution, is key to achieving desired selectivity and conversion levels in alkane ODH processes.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程，包括催化剂组成、反应条件和机理。本研究主要关注CuTh氧化物催化剂在乙烷和丙烷ODH反应中的表现。

催化剂的性能强烈依赖于Cu/Th原子比。催化剂表面存在不同的Cu2+物种，包括单体、二聚体和CuO晶体，每种物种在反应中都发挥作用。催化活性通常随铜浓度的增加而提高，但活性和选择性之间的关系并非线性。

对于乙烷ODH，总转化率达到13.5 mol%，但目标产物乙烯仅占9.3 mol%。在较高的Cu/Th比率（>0.25）下，CuO晶体的存在似乎增强了乙烷转化，但可能抑制乙烯的形成。

在丙烷ODH中，转化率与铜浓度密切相关，直到Cu/Th比率达到0.25，之后保持恒定。丙烯的选择性在Cu/Th=0.1时达到最大值，然后随着比率的增加而下降。

研究提出了丙烷ODH的一级反应模型，引入了选择性系数K，该系数关联了丙烷脱氢和丙烯氧化的速率常数。这个模型试图解释随着丙烷转化率增加，丙烯选择性下降的观察结果。

研究强调了同时实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战。催化剂表面不同铜物种及其浓度之间的相互作用显著影响反应途径和产物分布。

虽然研究没有明确讨论位点隔离，但不同Cu/Th比率下的性能变化表明，活性位点的分布和性质在决定催化行为中起着关键作用。在较高铜负载下形成的CuO晶体可能会减少孤立活性位点的数量，这可能解释了所观察到的选择性变化。

总的来说，该研究展示了ODH反应的复杂性，以及精心调整催化剂组成以优化性能的重要性。不同类型活性位点之间的平衡，受铜浓度和分布的影响，是在烷烃ODH过程中实现所需选择性和转化水平的关键。
