[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts prepared with different atomic ratios Cu/Th have been tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. These catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and selectivity change with the nature of the alkane."

[2] "Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products."

[3] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene."

[4] "As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "At low copper contents (Cu/Th <0.1), the conversion of propane and the selectivity in propene are more important compared to those obtained in the case of ethane."

[6] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of CuO may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."

[7] "The decrease of the selectivity in propene when the conversion of propane increases has already been discussed by Kung and Volta [8, 9] for the consecutive oxidation reactions"

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by several factors, including catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the nature of the alkane. 

CuTh oxide catalysts demonstrate activity and selectivity for the ODH of both ethane and propane, but their performance varies depending on the alkane and the Cu/Th ratio. For ethane ODH, catalytic activity increases with copper concentration, but selectivity to ethylene is inhibited at higher copper contents due to CuO formation. In contrast, propane ODH shows higher conversion and selectivity at lower copper contents.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are evident from the results. While the total conversion of ethane reached 13.5 mol%, only 9.3 mol% of the products was ethylene, indicating significant formation of undesired products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

The reaction mechanism involves consecutive oxidation reactions, as discussed by Kung and Volta. This explains the observed decrease in propene selectivity as propane conversion increases. The process efficiency is thus a balance between conversion and selectivity, influenced by the nature and concentration of copper sites on the catalyst surface.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The study shows that different copper species (monomers, dimers, and CuO crystallites) form at various Cu/Th ratios, each affecting the catalytic performance differently. For instance, Cu2+ ions in specific sites (characterized by M1, M2, and D signals) correlate with ethylene selectivity, while Cu2+ ions in substitutional sites (A1 and A2) may be responsible for propene selectivity.

In conclusion, the ODH process efficiency is a complex interplay of catalyst composition, alkane nature, and reaction conditions. Optimizing these factors to achieve the right balance of active sites and prevent over-oxidation remains a key challenge in improving ODH performance.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）受到多个因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应条件和烷烃的性质。

CuTh氧化物催化剂对乙烷和丙烷的ODH都表现出活性和选择性，但其性能因烷烃和Cu/Th比率的不同而有所变化。对于乙烷ODH，催化活性随铜浓度增加而增加，但由于CuO的形成，较高的铜含量会抑制乙烯的选择性。相比之下，丙烷ODH在较低的铜含量下表现出更高的转化率和选择性。

从结果中可以看出，实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战是显而易见的。虽然乙烷的总转化率达到了13.5 mol%，但只有9.3 mol%的产物是乙烯，表明产生了大量不期望的产物，如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。

反应机理涉及连续氧化反应，正如Kung和Volta所讨论的。这解释了观察到的丙烷转化率增加时丙烯选择性下降的现象。因此，过程效率是转化率和选择性之间的平衡，受催化剂表面铜位点的性质和浓度的影响。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。研究表明，在不同的Cu/Th比率下形成不同的铜物种（单体、二聚体和CuO晶体），每种物种对催化性能的影响不同。例如，特定位点的Cu2+离子（由M1、M2和D信号表征）与乙烯选择性相关，而取代位点的Cu2+离子（A1和A2）可能负责丙烯选择性。

总之，ODH过程效率是催化剂组成、烷烃性质和反应条件的复杂相互作用。优化这些因素以获得正确的活性位点平衡并防止过度氧化仍然是提高ODH性能的关键挑战。
