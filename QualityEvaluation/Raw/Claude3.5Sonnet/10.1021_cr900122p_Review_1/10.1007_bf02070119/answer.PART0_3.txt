[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts prepared with different atomic ratios Cu/Th have been tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. These catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and selectivity change with the nature of the alkane."

[2] "Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A1 and A2 signals, respectively, (Fig. la) at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu2+ ions, characterized by M1, M2 and D signals (Fig. la), occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H2 and/or O2 treatment at different temperatures."

[3] "From the above results, it is obvious that the conversion of ethane and propane to ethylene and propene, respectively, is closely correlated with the presence of copper in thoria."

[4] "Indeed, it has already been demonstrated [4-63 that the Cu2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and CuO crystallites for Cu/Th > 0.25 ratios."

[5] "Therefore, the selectivity in propene may be due to Cu2+ ions localized in substitutional sites (A1 and A2) rather than other sites."

The literature discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) using CuTh oxide catalysts. These catalysts show activity and selectivity for ethane and propane conversion to ethene and propene, respectively. The efficiency of the process is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: The Cu/Th atomic ratio affects the activity and selectivity. Different Cu2+ ion sites (substitutional, surface, dimers) play various roles in the reaction.

2. Nature of the alkane: The activity and selectivity change depending on whether ethane or propane is used as the reactant.

3. Copper content: Higher copper concentrations generally increase conversion but may decrease selectivity at very high levels due to CuO crystallite formation.

4. Site specificity: Different Cu2+ sites contribute differently to the reaction. For example, substitutional sites (A1 and A2) may be more important for propene selectivity.

The study does not explicitly discuss reaction mechanisms or site isolation. However, the emphasis on different Cu2+ sites and their roles suggests that site-specific interactions are important for catalytic performance.

The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion appear to be balancing the copper content and controlling the types of active sites present on the catalyst surface. The formation of CuO crystallites at high copper content seems to limit conversion, particularly for propane.

While the study provides insights into the relationship between catalyst composition and performance, it does not present a comprehensive analysis of reaction mechanisms or strategies for optimizing selectivity and conversion simultaneously.

这篇文献讨论了使用CuTh氧化物催化剂进行烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的过程。这些催化剂对乙烷和丙烷转化为乙烯和丙烯分别表现出活性和选择性。过程效率受几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成：Cu/Th原子比影响活性和选择性。不同的Cu2+离子位点（取代位、表面位、二聚体）在反应中发挥不同作用。

2. 烷烃的性质：活性和选择性会随着使用乙烷还是丙烷作为反应物而变化。

3. 铜含量：较高的铜浓度通常会增加转化率，但在非常高的水平下可能会由于CuO晶体的形成而降低选择性。

4. 位点特异性：不同的Cu2+位点对反应的贡献不同。例如，取代位点（A1和A2）可能对丙烯选择性更为重要。

这项研究没有明确讨论反应机理或位点隔离。然而，对不同Cu2+位点及其作用的强调表明，位点特异性相互作用对催化性能很重要。

实现高选择性和高转化率的主要挑战似乎是平衡铜含量和控制催化剂表面存在的活性位点类型。高铜含量下CuO晶体的形成似乎限制了转化率，特别是对于丙烷。

虽然这项研究提供了催化剂组成与性能之间关系的见解，但它没有对反应机理或同时优化选择性和转化率的策略进行全面分析。
