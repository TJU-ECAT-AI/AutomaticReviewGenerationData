[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts prepared with different atomic ratios Cu/Th have been tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. These catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and selectivity change with the nature of the alkane."

[2] "Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products."

[3] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene."

[4] "As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of CuO may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."

[6] "In the case of propane, the catalytic activity may be due to the presence of Cu2+ ions on the solid surface (M1, M2 and D) since the formation of CuO crystallites particularly at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between catalysts and reactants. The study focuses on CuTh oxide catalysts for ethane and propane ODH. These catalysts show activity and selectivity in forming ethene and propene, but their performance varies depending on the alkane used.

For ethane ODH, the catalytic activity increases with copper concentration in thoria. However, higher copper content leads to the formation of CuO, which may inhibit ethylene formation. The total conversion of ethane reached 13.5 mol%, but only 9.3 mol% of the products was ethylene, indicating challenges in achieving high selectivity.

In propane ODH, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu2+ ions on the solid surface. However, the formation of CuO crystallites at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion. This suggests that site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues, as the specific form and location of copper ions influence the reaction.

The study does not explicitly discuss C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction mechanisms. However, the differences in catalyst performance for ethane and propane suggest that the reaction mechanisms may vary depending on the alkane structure.

The process efficiency is influenced by the interplay between copper content, copper species formed (ions vs. crystallites), and the nature of the alkane. Balancing these factors is crucial for optimizing both conversion and selectivity in the ODH process.

Overall, while the CuTh oxide catalysts show promise for ODH reactions, they are described as "poor catalysts," indicating that there is still room for improvement in catalyst design and reaction conditions to enhance process efficiency.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及催化剂和反应物之间的复杂相互作用。这项研究聚焦于CuTh氧化物催化剂在乙烷和丙烷ODH中的应用。这些催化剂在形成乙烯和丙烯方面表现出活性和选择性，但其性能随所使用的烷烃而变化。

对于乙烷ODH，催化活性随着铜在氧化钍中的浓度增加而增加。然而，更高的铜含量会导致CuO的形成，这可能会抑制乙烯的形成。乙烷的总转化率达到13.5 mol%，但产物中只有9.3 mol%是乙烯，表明在实现高选择性方面存在挑战。

在丙烷ODH中，催化活性归因于固体表面的Cu2+离子。然而，在高铜含量（Cu/Th > 0.25）下形成的CuO晶体限制了转化率。这表明位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用，因为铜离子的特定形式和位置影响反应。

该研究没有明确讨论C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提机制。然而，催化剂在乙烷和丙烷反应中性能的差异表明，反应机制可能因烷烃结构而异。

过程效率受到铜含量、形成的铜物种（离子vs晶体）以及烷烃性质之间相互作用的影响。平衡这些因素对于优化ODH过程中的转化率和选择性至关重要。

总的来说，虽然CuTh氧化物催化剂在ODH反应中显示出潜力，但它们被描述为"较差的催化剂"，这表明在催化剂设计和反应条件方面仍有改进空间，以提高过程效率。
