The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by several factors, including catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and the nature of the alkane. 

CuTh oxide catalysts demonstrate activity and selectivity for the ODH of both ethane and propane, but their performance varies depending on the alkane and the Cu/Th ratio. For ethane ODH, catalytic activity increases with copper concentration, but selectivity to ethylene is inhibited at higher copper contents due to CuO formation. In contrast, propane ODH shows higher conversion and selectivity at lower copper contents.

The challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion are evident from the results. While the total conversion of ethane reached 13.5 mol%, only 9.3 mol% of the products was ethylene, indicating significant formation of undesired products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

The reaction mechanism involves consecutive oxidation reactions, as discussed by Kung and Volta. This explains the observed decrease in propene selectivity as propane conversion increases. The process efficiency is thus a balance between conversion and selectivity, influenced by the nature and concentration of copper sites on the catalyst surface.

Site isolation plays a crucial role in addressing selectivity issues. The study shows that different copper species (monomers, dimers, and CuO crystallites) form at various Cu/Th ratios, each affecting the catalytic performance differently. For instance, Cu2+ ions in specific sites (characterized by M1, M2, and D signals) correlate with ethylene selectivity, while Cu2+ ions in substitutional sites (A1 and A2) may be responsible for propene selectivity.

In conclusion, the ODH process efficiency is a complex interplay of catalyst composition, alkane nature, and reaction conditions. Optimizing these factors to achieve the right balance of active sites and prevent over-oxidation remains a key challenge in improving ODH performance.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）受到多个因素的影响，包括催化剂组成、反应条件和烷烃的性质。

CuTh氧化物催化剂对乙烷和丙烷的ODH都表现出活性和选择性，但其性能因烷烃和Cu/Th比率的不同而有所变化。对于乙烷ODH，催化活性随铜浓度增加而增加，但由于CuO的形成，较高的铜含量会抑制乙烯的选择性。相比之下，丙烷ODH在较低的铜含量下表现出更高的转化率和选择性。

从结果中可以看出，实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战是显而易见的。虽然乙烷的总转化率达到了13.5 mol%，但只有9.3 mol%的产物是乙烯，表明产生了大量不期望的产物，如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。

反应机理涉及连续氧化反应，正如Kung和Volta所讨论的。这解释了观察到的丙烷转化率增加时丙烯选择性下降的现象。因此，过程效率是转化率和选择性之间的平衡，受催化剂表面铜位点的性质和浓度的影响。

位点隔离在解决选择性问题中起着关键作用。研究表明，在不同的Cu/Th比率下形成不同的铜物种（单体、二聚体和CuO晶体），每种物种对催化性能的影响不同。例如，特定位点的Cu2+离子（由M1、M2和D信号表征）与乙烯选择性相关，而取代位点的Cu2+离子（A1和A2）可能负责丙烯选择性。

总之，ODH过程效率是催化剂组成、烷烃性质和反应条件的复杂相互作用。优化这些因素以获得正确的活性位点平衡并防止过度氧化仍然是提高ODH性能的关键挑战。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various factors related to catalysts, selectivity, conversion, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Catalyst composition: The study focuses on CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios. The presence and concentration of copper in thoria significantly affect the catalytic activity and selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH.

2. Active sites: Different copper species (Cu2+ ions) occupy various sites on the catalyst surface, characterized by EPR signals (A1, A2, M1, M2, and D). These sites play different roles in the ODH process, with some being more active for certain reactions.

3. Selectivity and conversion: The selectivity and conversion vary depending on the alkane (ethane or propane) and the copper content in the catalyst. For example, at low copper contents (Cu/Th <0.1), propane conversion and propene selectivity are higher compared to ethane ODH.

4. Reaction products: Besides the desired alkenes (ethylene and propene), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are major byproducts, affecting the overall selectivity of the process.

5. Copper concentration effects: The catalytic activity generally increases with copper concentration in thoria. However, the formation of CuO crystallites at higher copper contents (Cu/Th > 0.25) can inhibit the formation of ethylene.

6. Site-specific activity: Different copper sites show varying activities for different reactions. For instance, the selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by M1, M2, and D signals, while propene selectivity may be more related to Cu2+ ions in substitutional sites (A1 and A2).

The study does not explicitly discuss site isolation or specific reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation or M-alkyl intermediates. However, the varying activities of different copper sites suggest that site isolation may play a role in the selectivity of the ODH process. The overall efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, active site distribution, and reaction conditions, which collectively determine the balance between desired product formation and undesired side reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）受到与催化剂、选择性、转化率和反应机理相关的各种因素的影响：

1. 催化剂组成：该研究重点关注具有不同Cu/Th原子比的CuTh氧化物催化剂。铜在氧化钍中的存在和浓度显著影响乙烷和丙烷ODH的催化活性和选择性。

2. 活性位点：不同的铜物种（Cu2+离子）占据催化剂表面的各种位点，通过EPR信号（A1、A2、M1、M2和D）进行表征。这些位点在ODH过程中发挥不同的作用，某些位点对特定反应更加活跃。

3. 选择性和转化率：选择性和转化率根据烷烃（乙烷或丙烷）和催化剂中的铜含量而变化。例如，在低铜含量（Cu/Th <0.1）下，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性比乙烷ODH更高。

4. 反应产物：除了所需的烯烃（乙烯和丙烯）外，一氧化碳和二氧化碳是主要副产品，影响整个过程的总体选择性。

5. 铜浓度效应：催化活性通常随氧化钍中铜浓度的增加而增加。但是，在较高铜含量（Cu/Th > 0.25）下形成的CuO晶体可能会抑制乙烯的形成。

6. 特定位点活性：不同的铜位点对不同反应表现出不同的活性。例如，乙烯的选择性与M1、M2和D信号表征的铜(II)位点相关，而丙烯选择性可能更多地与取代位点（A1和A2）中的Cu2+离子有关。

该研究并未明确讨论位点隔离或特定反应机理，如C-H键活化或M-烷基中间体。然而，不同铜位点的活性差异表明，位点隔离可能在ODH过程的选择性中起作用。整个过程的效率受到催化剂组成、活性位点分布和反应条件之间相互作用的影响，这些因素共同决定了所需产物形成和不需要的副反应之间的平衡。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is a complex process influenced by various factors, including catalyst composition, reaction conditions, and mechanisms. The study focuses on CuTh oxide catalysts for the ODH of ethane and propane.

The catalysts' performance is strongly dependent on the Cu/Th atomic ratio. Different Cu2+ species exist on the catalyst surface, including monomers, dimers, and CuO crystallites, each playing a role in the reaction. The catalytic activity generally increases with copper concentration, but the relationship between activity and selectivity is not linear.

For ethane ODH, the total conversion reached 13.5 mol%, but only 9.3 mol% was the desired ethylene product. The presence of CuO crystallites at higher Cu/Th ratios (>0.25) seems to enhance ethane conversion but may inhibit ethylene formation.

In propane ODH, the conversion is closely correlated with copper concentration up to Cu/Th ratios of 0.25, after which it remains constant. The selectivity towards propene reaches a maximum at Cu/Th=0.1 and then decreases for higher ratios.

The study proposes a first-order reaction model for propane ODH, introducing a selectivity coefficient K that relates the rate constants of propane dehydrogenation and propene oxidation. This model attempts to explain the observed decrease in propene selectivity as propane conversion increases.

The research highlights the challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously. The interplay between different copper species and their concentrations on the catalyst surface significantly influences the reaction pathways and product distribution.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss site isolation, the varying performance with different Cu/Th ratios suggests that the distribution and nature of active sites play a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior. The formation of CuO crystallites at higher copper loadings may reduce the number of isolated active sites, potentially explaining the observed changes in selectivity.

Overall, the study demonstrates the complexity of ODH reactions and the importance of carefully tuning catalyst composition to optimize performance. The balance between different types of active sites, influenced by copper concentration and distribution, is key to achieving desired selectivity and conversion levels in alkane ODH processes.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）是一个受多种因素影响的复杂过程，包括催化剂组成、反应条件和机理。本研究主要关注CuTh氧化物催化剂在乙烷和丙烷ODH反应中的表现。

催化剂的性能强烈依赖于Cu/Th原子比。催化剂表面存在不同的Cu2+物种，包括单体、二聚体和CuO晶体，每种物种在反应中都发挥作用。催化活性通常随铜浓度的增加而提高，但活性和选择性之间的关系并非线性。

对于乙烷ODH，总转化率达到13.5 mol%，但目标产物乙烯仅占9.3 mol%。在较高的Cu/Th比率（>0.25）下，CuO晶体的存在似乎增强了乙烷转化，但可能抑制乙烯的形成。

在丙烷ODH中，转化率与铜浓度密切相关，直到Cu/Th比率达到0.25，之后保持恒定。丙烯的选择性在Cu/Th=0.1时达到最大值，然后随着比率的增加而下降。

研究提出了丙烷ODH的一级反应模型，引入了选择性系数K，该系数关联了丙烷脱氢和丙烯氧化的速率常数。这个模型试图解释随着丙烷转化率增加，丙烯选择性下降的观察结果。

研究强调了同时实现高选择性和高转化率的挑战。催化剂表面不同铜物种及其浓度之间的相互作用显著影响反应途径和产物分布。

虽然研究没有明确讨论位点隔离，但不同Cu/Th比率下的性能变化表明，活性位点的分布和性质在决定催化行为中起着关键作用。在较高铜负载下形成的CuO晶体可能会减少孤立活性位点的数量，这可能解释了所观察到的选择性变化。

总的来说，该研究展示了ODH反应的复杂性，以及精心调整催化剂组成以优化性能的重要性。不同类型活性位点之间的平衡，受铜浓度和分布的影响，是在烷烃ODH过程中实现所需选择性和转化水平的关键。

The literature discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) using CuTh oxide catalysts. These catalysts show activity and selectivity for ethane and propane conversion to ethene and propene, respectively. The efficiency of the process is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: The Cu/Th atomic ratio affects the activity and selectivity. Different Cu2+ ion sites (substitutional, surface, dimers) play various roles in the reaction.

2. Nature of the alkane: The activity and selectivity change depending on whether ethane or propane is used as the reactant.

3. Copper content: Higher copper concentrations generally increase conversion but may decrease selectivity at very high levels due to CuO crystallite formation.

4. Site specificity: Different Cu2+ sites contribute differently to the reaction. For example, substitutional sites (A1 and A2) may be more important for propene selectivity.

The study does not explicitly discuss reaction mechanisms or site isolation. However, the emphasis on different Cu2+ sites and their roles suggests that site-specific interactions are important for catalytic performance.

The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion appear to be balancing the copper content and controlling the types of active sites present on the catalyst surface. The formation of CuO crystallites at high copper content seems to limit conversion, particularly for propane.

While the study provides insights into the relationship between catalyst composition and performance, it does not present a comprehensive analysis of reaction mechanisms or strategies for optimizing selectivity and conversion simultaneously.

这篇文献讨论了使用CuTh氧化物催化剂进行烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的过程。这些催化剂对乙烷和丙烷转化为乙烯和丙烯分别表现出活性和选择性。过程效率受几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成：Cu/Th原子比影响活性和选择性。不同的Cu2+离子位点（取代位、表面位、二聚体）在反应中发挥不同作用。

2. 烷烃的性质：活性和选择性会随着使用乙烷还是丙烷作为反应物而变化。

3. 铜含量：较高的铜浓度通常会增加转化率，但在非常高的水平下可能会由于CuO晶体的形成而降低选择性。

4. 位点特异性：不同的Cu2+位点对反应的贡献不同。例如，取代位点（A1和A2）可能对丙烯选择性更为重要。

这项研究没有明确讨论反应机理或位点隔离。然而，对不同Cu2+位点及其作用的强调表明，位点特异性相互作用对催化性能很重要。

实现高选择性和高转化率的主要挑战似乎是平衡铜含量和控制催化剂表面存在的活性位点类型。高铜含量下CuO晶体的形成似乎限制了转化率，特别是对于丙烷。

虽然这项研究提供了催化剂组成与性能之间关系的见解，但它没有对反应机理或同时优化选择性和转化率的策略进行全面分析。

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) involves complex interactions between catalysts and reactants. The study focuses on CuTh oxide catalysts for ethane and propane ODH. These catalysts show activity and selectivity in forming ethene and propene, but their performance varies depending on the alkane used.

For ethane ODH, the catalytic activity increases with copper concentration in thoria. However, higher copper content leads to the formation of CuO, which may inhibit ethylene formation. The total conversion of ethane reached 13.5 mol%, but only 9.3 mol% of the products was ethylene, indicating challenges in achieving high selectivity.

In propane ODH, the catalytic activity is attributed to Cu2+ ions on the solid surface. However, the formation of CuO crystallites at high copper content (Cu/Th > 0.25) limits the conversion. This suggests that site isolation plays a role in addressing selectivity issues, as the specific form and location of copper ions influence the reaction.

The study does not explicitly discuss C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction mechanisms. However, the differences in catalyst performance for ethane and propane suggest that the reaction mechanisms may vary depending on the alkane structure.

The process efficiency is influenced by the interplay between copper content, copper species formed (ions vs. crystallites), and the nature of the alkane. Balancing these factors is crucial for optimizing both conversion and selectivity in the ODH process.

Overall, while the CuTh oxide catalysts show promise for ODH reactions, they are described as "poor catalysts," indicating that there is still room for improvement in catalyst design and reaction conditions to enhance process efficiency.

对于乙烷ODH，催化活性随着铜在氧化钍中的浓度增加而增加。然而，更高的铜含量会导致CuO的形成，这可能会抑制乙烯的形成。乙烷的总转化率达到13.5 mol%，但产物中只有9.3 mol%是乙烯，表明在实现高选择性方面存在挑战。

在丙烷ODH中，催化活性归因于固体表面的Cu2+离子。然而，在高铜含量（Cu/Th > 0.25）下形成的CuO晶体限制了转化率。这表明位点隔离在解决选择性问题方面发挥作用，因为铜离子的特定形式和位置影响反应。

该研究没有明确讨论C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提机制。然而，催化剂在乙烷和丙烷反应中性能的差异表明，反应机制可能因烷烃结构而异。

过程效率受到铜含量、形成的铜物种（离子vs晶体）以及烷烃性质之间相互作用的影响。平衡这些因素对于优化ODH过程中的转化率和选择性至关重要。

总的来说，虽然CuTh氧化物催化剂在ODH反应中显示出潜力，但它们被描述为"较差的催化剂"，这表明在催化剂设计和反应条件方面仍有改进空间，以提高过程效率。
