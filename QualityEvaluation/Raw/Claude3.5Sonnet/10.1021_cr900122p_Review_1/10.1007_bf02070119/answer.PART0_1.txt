[1] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]. Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A1 and A2 signals, respectively, (Fig. la) at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu2+ ions, characterized by M1, M2 and D signals (Fig. la), occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H2 and/or O2 treatment at different temperatures."

[2] "Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products. The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene."

[3] "As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Figure 2b and Table ib show clearly that the conversion of propane is closely correlated to the copper concentration ThO2 when the Cu/Th atomic ratio is less than 0.25 and it remains constant for larger atomic ratios."

[4] "From the above results, it is obvious that the conversion of ethane and propane to ethylene and propene, respectively, is closely correlated with the presence of copper in thoria. At low copper contents (Cu/Th <0.1), the conversion of propane and the selectivity in propene are more important compared to those obtained in the case of ethane."

[5] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of CuO may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene. Consequently, the selectivity in ethylene can be correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by M1, M2 and D signals."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is influenced by various factors related to catalysts, selectivity, conversion, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Catalyst composition: The study focuses on CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios. The presence and concentration of copper in thoria significantly affect the catalytic activity and selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH.

2. Active sites: Different copper species (Cu2+ ions) occupy various sites on the catalyst surface, characterized by EPR signals (A1, A2, M1, M2, and D). These sites play different roles in the ODH process, with some being more active for certain reactions.

3. Selectivity and conversion: The selectivity and conversion vary depending on the alkane (ethane or propane) and the copper content in the catalyst. For example, at low copper contents (Cu/Th <0.1), propane conversion and propene selectivity are higher compared to ethane ODH.

4. Reaction products: Besides the desired alkenes (ethylene and propene), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are major byproducts, affecting the overall selectivity of the process.

5. Copper concentration effects: The catalytic activity generally increases with copper concentration in thoria. However, the formation of CuO crystallites at higher copper contents (Cu/Th > 0.25) can inhibit the formation of ethylene.

6. Site-specific activity: Different copper sites show varying activities for different reactions. For instance, the selectivity in ethylene is correlated with copper(II) sites characterized by M1, M2, and D signals, while propene selectivity may be more related to Cu2+ ions in substitutional sites (A1 and A2).

The study does not explicitly discuss site isolation or specific reaction mechanisms like C-H bond activation or M-alkyl intermediates. However, the varying activities of different copper sites suggest that site isolation may play a role in the selectivity of the ODH process. The overall efficiency of the process is influenced by the interplay between catalyst composition, active site distribution, and reaction conditions, which collectively determine the balance between desired product formation and undesired side reactions.

烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）受到与催化剂、选择性、转化率和反应机理相关的各种因素的影响：

1. 催化剂组成：该研究重点关注具有不同Cu/Th原子比的CuTh氧化物催化剂。铜在氧化钍中的存在和浓度显著影响乙烷和丙烷ODH的催化活性和选择性。

2. 活性位点：不同的铜物种（Cu2+离子）占据催化剂表面的各种位点，通过EPR信号（A1、A2、M1、M2和D）进行表征。这些位点在ODH过程中发挥不同的作用，某些位点对特定反应更加活跃。

3. 选择性和转化率：选择性和转化率根据烷烃（乙烷或丙烷）和催化剂中的铜含量而变化。例如，在低铜含量（Cu/Th <0.1）下，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性比乙烷ODH更高。

4. 反应产物：除了所需的烯烃（乙烯和丙烯）外，一氧化碳和二氧化碳是主要副产品，影响整个过程的总体选择性。

5. 铜浓度效应：催化活性通常随氧化钍中铜浓度的增加而增加。但是，在较高铜含量（Cu/Th > 0.25）下形成的CuO晶体可能会抑制乙烯的形成。

6. 特定位点活性：不同的铜位点对不同反应表现出不同的活性。例如，乙烯的选择性与M1、M2和D信号表征的铜(II)位点相关，而丙烯选择性可能更多地与取代位点（A1和A2）中的Cu2+离子有关。

该研究并未明确讨论位点隔离或特定反应机理，如C-H键活化或M-烷基中间体。然而，不同铜位点的活性差异表明，位点隔离可能在ODH过程的选择性中起作用。整个过程的效率受到催化剂组成、活性位点分布和反应条件之间相互作用的影响，这些因素共同决定了所需产物形成和不需要的副反应之间的平衡。
