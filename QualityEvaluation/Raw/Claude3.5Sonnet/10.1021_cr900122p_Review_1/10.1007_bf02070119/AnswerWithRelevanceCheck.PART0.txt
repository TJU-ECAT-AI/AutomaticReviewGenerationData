          [1] "CuTh oxide catalysts prepared with different atomic ratios Cu/Th have been tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. These catalysts are active and selective in the formation of ethene and propene, but the activity and selectivity change with the nature of the alkane."

[2] "Besides the desired ethylene, carbon monoxide and specifically carbon dioxide were major products."

[3] "The catalytic activity increases with the copper concentration in thoria (ThO2). The total conversion of ethan was ca. 13.5 mol %, however, only 9.3 mol % of the products was ethylene."

[4] "As in the case of ethane, the CuTh oxide catalysts are active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "Since the conversion of ethane is more important at higher copper contents, the presence of CuO may be responsible since its formation begins already at low copper contents, but such species seem to inhibit the formation of ethylene."

[6] "CuTh oxide catalysts with different Cu/Th atomic ratios have been widely studied by EPR technique [4-7]. Apart from the substitutional sites occupied by Cu2+ ions both on the surface and in the bulk of thoria, characterized by A1 and A2 signals, respectively, (Fig. la) at atomic ratios Cu/Th < 0.01, other Cu2+ ions, characterized by M1, M2 and D signals (Fig. la), occupying different sites on the surface of CuTh oxide catalysts (Cu/Th > 0.01) were susceptible to H2 and/or O2 treatment at different temperatures."

[7] "Therefore, the nature and the copper site concentrations have an important role to explain this difference in both reactions. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated [4-63 that the Cu2+ ions in thoria exist in different forms: monomers on the solid surface and dimers formed by copper in substitutional sites and copper present on the surface and CuO crystallites for Cu/Th > 0.25 ratios."

[8] "Supposing that the reaction is first order, the selectivity S in propene is given by the following equation: S = (K-1)/K (1-C)[(1-C)K-1] / (E-1) C where K=k1/k2 is the coefficient of selectivity, k1 and k2 are the rate constants of dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation of propene, respectively, and C the conversion of propane."

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) using CuTh oxide catalysts involves complex interactions between catalysts, reactants, and reaction conditions. The study reveals several key factors influencing the process efficiency:

1. Catalyst composition: The Cu/Th atomic ratio significantly affects catalyst activity and selectivity. Different Cu2+ species (monomers, dimers, and CuO crystallites) form at various ratios, each playing distinct roles in the reaction.

2. Nature of the alkane: The catalysts show different activities and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH, indicating that the alkane structure influences the reaction pathway.

3. Copper concentration: Generally, catalytic activity increases with copper concentration in thoria. However, high copper content leads to CuO formation, which can inhibit ethylene formation in ethane ODH.

4. Active sites: Various Cu2+ ion sites (substitutional, surface, dimers) contribute differently to the reaction. For example, Cu2+ ions characterized by M1, M2, and D signals may be responsible for ethylene selectivity, while substitutional sites (A1 and A2) may influence propene selectivity.

5. Selectivity challenges: The formation of undesired products (CO and CO2) alongside the desired alkenes indicates difficulties in achieving high selectivity. For ethane, only 9.3 mol% of products was ethylene despite a total conversion of 13.5 mol%.

6. Site isolation: The varying performance with different Cu/Th ratios and the formation of CuO crystallites at higher copper loadings suggest that site isolation plays a role in determining catalytic behavior and addressing selectivity issues.

7. Reaction kinetics: A first-order reaction model is proposed for propane ODH, introducing a selectivity coefficient that relates the rate constants of propane dehydrogenation and propene oxidation.

The study does not explicitly discuss C-H bond activation, M-alkyl intermediates, or 2H-abstraction mechanisms. However, the observed differences in catalyst performance for ethane and propane suggest that these mechanistic aspects may vary depending on the alkane structure.

The main challenges in achieving high selectivity and conversion simultaneously lie in balancing the copper content, controlling the types of active sites present on the catalyst surface, and optimizing reaction conditions. The formation of CuO crystallites at high copper content seems to limit conversion, particularly for propane ODH.

In conclusion, the efficiency of the ODH process is determined by the complex interplay between catalyst composition, active site distribution, and reaction conditions. Optimizing these factors to achieve the right balance of active sites and prevent over-oxidation remains a key challenge in improving ODH performance.

          使用CuTh氧化物催化剂进行烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）涉及催化剂、反应物和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用。研究揭示了几个影响过程效率的关键因素：

1. 催化剂组成：Cu/Th原子比显著影响催化剂活性和选择性。不同的Cu2+物种（单体、二聚体和CuO晶体）在不同比例下形成，每种物种在反应中发挥不同作用。

2. 烷烃的性质：催化剂对乙烷和丙烷ODH表现出不同的活性和选择性，表明烷烃结构影响反应路径。

3. 铜浓度：通常，催化活性随氧化钍中铜浓度的增加而增加。然而，高铜含量导致CuO形成，可能抑制乙烷ODH中乙烯的形成。

4. 活性位点：不同的Cu2+离子位点（取代位、表面位、二聚体）对反应的贡献不同。例如，由M1、M2和D信号表征的Cu2+离子可能负责乙烯选择性，而取代位点（A1和A2）可能影响丙烯选择性。

5. 选择性挑战：除了所需的烯烃外，还形成不期望的产物（CO和CO2），表明难以实现高选择性。对于乙烷，尽管总转化率为13.5 mol%，但只有9.3 mol%的产物是乙烯。

6. 位点隔离：不同Cu/Th比率下的性能变化以及在较高铜负载下形成CuO晶体表明，位点隔离在决定催化行为和解决选择性问题方面发挥作用。

7. 反应动力学：提出了丙烷ODH的一级反应模型，引入了将丙烷脱氢和丙烯氧化速率常数相关联的选择性系数。

研究没有明确讨论C-H键活化、M-烷基中间体或2H-抽提机制。然而，观察到的催化剂在乙烷和丙烷反应中性能的差异表明，这些机理方面可能因烷烃结构而异。

同时实现高选择性和高转化率的主要挑战在于平衡铜含量、控制催化剂表面存在的活性位点类型以及优化反应条件。高铜含量下形成的CuO晶体似乎限制了转化率，特别是对于丙烷ODH。

总之，ODH过程的效率由催化剂组成、活性位点分布和反应条件之间的复杂相互作用决定。优化这些因素以获得正确的活性位点平衡并防止过度氧化仍然是提高ODH性能的关键挑战。
