[1] "Present knowledge on the typical behavior of electron transfer processes involved in chemical reactions catalyzed by oxide semiconductors have been mainly obtained through the pioneering studies of Wagner and Hauffe' and Garner and associates"

[2] "Thus it became apparent that the defective structure of the catalytic surface, which controls its semi-conductivity, would affect the chemical reaction occurring on it."

[3] "The present communication refers to the oxidation of carbon monoxide on nickel oxide samples, whose electronic characteristics have been modified following the method of controlled valency semi-conductors, recently developed by Yerwey and associates."

[4] "The addition of foreign ions into the nickel oxide lattice might modify the concentration and distribution of holes and electrons by suitable changes of the Fermi level of the semi-conductor."

The literature does not directly address the historical unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant insights into the relationship between impurities, electronic properties, and catalytic activity in oxide catalysts.

The study demonstrates that the addition of foreign ions to nickel oxide can modify its electronic characteristics and affect its catalytic properties in carbon monoxide oxidation. This suggests that impurities or additives in oxide catalysts throughout history may have unintentionally altered their catalytic performance.

The research highlights the importance of understanding the electronic structure of catalysts and how it relates to their activity. This perspective implies that many historical catalytic processes may have been influenced by unrecognized doping effects from impurities.

For modern catalyst design, this historical perspective emphasizes the need to carefully control and understand the role of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. It suggests that intentional doping could be a powerful tool for optimizing catalytic performance, and that the electronic properties of catalysts should be a key consideration in their development.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论掺杂氧化物催化剂在历史上的无意使用。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧化物催化剂中杂质、电子性质和催化活性之间关系的相关见解。

研究表明，向氧化镍中添加外来离子可以改变其电子特性，并影响其在一氧化碳氧化中的催化性能。这暗示着在历史上，氧化物催化剂中的杂质或添加剂可能无意中改变了它们的催化性能。

这项研究强调了理解催化剂电子结构及其与活性关系的重要性。这一观点意味着许多历史上的催化过程可能受到了未被认识的掺杂效应的影响。

对于现代催化剂设计而言，这一历史视角强调了需要仔细控制和理解杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂中的作用。它表明，有意掺杂可能是优化催化性能的有力工具，并且催化剂的电子性质应该是其开发过程中的一个关键考虑因素。
