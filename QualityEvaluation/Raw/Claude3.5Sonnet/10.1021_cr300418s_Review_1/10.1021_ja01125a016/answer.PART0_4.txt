[1] "As a preliminary study in this field, the reduction process of nickel oxide by hydrogen was investigated in order to obtain information on the effect of ionic and electronic defects in the solid phase on its reductive properties."

[2] "These considerations indicate that processes (b) and (c) are not, under the present experimental conditions, rate determining. Process (c) however, can become significant at low pressures, where the mechanism of reduction must be different from that occurring at higher pressures."

[3] "The addition of any of these salts to cadmium chloride reduced the solubility of the metal."

The literature does not directly address the historical use of doped oxide catalysts or its implications for modern catalyst design. However, it does discuss studying the effects of impurities and defects on the reduction properties of nickel oxide, which is relevant to catalysis. The research indicates that ionic and electronic defects in the solid phase can significantly impact reduction processes. This suggests that impurities and additives in oxide catalysts likely played an unintended but important role in historical catalytic processes, even if not fully understood at the time.

The implications for our current understanding are that the presence of impurities or dopants can fundamentally alter the behavior of oxide catalysts, affecting reaction rates and mechanisms. This historical perspective highlights the importance of carefully controlling and analyzing the composition of catalysts, including trace impurities, in modern catalyst design and development. It also underscores the potential for intentionally introducing specific dopants or defects to tune catalytic properties, an approach that may not have been systematically exploited in earlier periods of catalysis research.

文献没有直接讨论掺杂氧化物催化剂的历史使用或其对现代催化剂设计的影响。然而，它确实讨论了研究杂质和缺陷对氧化镍还原性能的影响，这与催化作用相关。研究表明，固相中的离子和电子缺陷可以显著影响还原过程。这表明，杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂中可能在历史上的催化过程中扮演了无意但重要的角色，即使当时没有被完全理解。

对我们当前理解的启示是，杂质或掺杂剂的存在可以从根本上改变氧化物催化剂的行为，影响反应速率和机制。这一历史视角突出了在现代催化剂设计和开发中仔细控制和分析催化剂成分（包括微量杂质）的重要性。它还强调了有意引入特定掺杂剂或缺陷以调节催化性能的潜力，这种方法在早期的催化研究中可能没有被系统地利用。
