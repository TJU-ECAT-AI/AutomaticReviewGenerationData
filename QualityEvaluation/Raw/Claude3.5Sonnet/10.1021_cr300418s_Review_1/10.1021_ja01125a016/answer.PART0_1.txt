[1] "Theoretical advances and successful applications of the band theory of the solid state have recently led to a better understanding of the electronic properties of metallic oxides. In the field of catalysis the production of oxide semi-conductors with controlled electronic characteristics by Verwey and his school' discloses new possibilities, and affords a sound basis for attacking the problem of the relation between electronic states of oxides and their activity to catalyze chemical reactions."

[2] "As a preliminary study in this field, the reduction process of nickel oxide by hydrogen was investigated in order to obtain information on the effect of ionic and electronic defects in the solid phase on its reductive properties."

[3] "The present data refer mainly to this latter stage of the reductive process and clearly show how the reaction can be greatly affected by the defective structure of the solid phase."

[4] "It must be pointed out that the above concentrations of impurities in nickel oxide refer to over-all values of impurity content. It does not imply that all the impurity is homogeneously distributed in the nickel oxide lattice."

The historical perspective on impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design. 

The unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout catalysis history has likely been widespread due to the presence of impurities in materials. This realization highlights the importance of understanding the role of defects and impurities in catalytic activity. The advent of band theory and its application to metallic oxides has enabled a deeper comprehension of how electronic properties influence catalytic behavior.

The study of nickel oxide reduction by hydrogen demonstrates how the defective structure of the solid phase can greatly affect reactivity. This insight emphasizes the need to consider and control the presence of ionic and electronic defects in catalyst materials.

The fact that impurities may not be homogeneously distributed in the catalyst lattice adds another layer of complexity to understanding catalytic processes. This heterogeneity could lead to localized effects on catalytic activity that may have been overlooked in earlier research.

These historical perspectives have led to the intentional production of oxide semiconductors with controlled electronic characteristics, opening new possibilities in catalyst design. Modern catalyst development now focuses on deliberately introducing and controlling defects and impurities to enhance catalytic performance.

This historical context underscores the importance of precise characterization techniques and controlled synthesis methods in modern catalyst design. It also highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how impurities and defects influence electronic properties and, consequently, catalytic activity at the atomic and molecular levels.
