In 
contrast, addition of acetone to tributyl phosphate 
reduces the heat of solution of the dihydrate in 
the direction of the heat of solution in acetone, to 
-8.72 kcal. for 25% acetone and -8.29 kcal. for 
50% acetone by volume.

The heat effects of adding water to solutions of 
uranyl nitrate dihydrate in the weaker bases show 
that at low water levels, where hexasolvate forma- 
tion is minor, one should get an effect analogous 
to that exhibited by the acetone-alcohol mixtures. 
Experimental values for water-acetone mixtures 
(Table IV) confirm this. The -10.98 kcal. at 
3.25% water represents a minimal value for the 
heat of solution of uranyl nitrate dihydrate in water 
to give undissociated uranyl nitrate tetrahydrate; 
the process of dissociation of the nitrates and 
coordination of two more molecules of water thus 
absorbs a net minimum of 5.6 kcal., to give the 
over-all value for pure water of -5.37 kcal. That 
the heat difference in the water case, for a lesser 
distance of separation o
f
 cation and anions, is 2.1 
kcal. greater than for the alcohol-acetone mixtures 
vs. pure alcohol may be attributed in part to a 
greater binding energy for water, since the difference 
under discussion is the resultant of the exothermic 
solvent binding process, and the endothermic ion 
separation process. Considering this, the true 
value for the heat of solution to give the undis- 
sociated tetrahydrate runs ahead of the heats for 
the ethers, in agreement with what one would 
anticipate from the relative base strengths.

In view of the statements of Mathieson13 it 
apparently needs to be stressed that in the absence

involved.

The Reduction of Nickel Oxide by Hydrogen 
BY GIUSEPPE

The reduction of nickel oxide by hydrogen has been studied in the range of 150-350' and initial pressures of hydrogen from 
The addition of foreign ions to nickel oxide affects both the rate and activation energy for reduction. 
200 to 500 mm. 
These effects have been related to the change in the electronic properties o
f
 the oxide. 
The problem of the extent to which chemical 
interactions involving a solid phase are affected 
by the energetic structure of that phase has been 
the subject of considerable experimental and theo- 
retical work. These studies proceeded through 
different approaches, mainly centered on the 
elucidation of the mechanism of heterogeneous 
catalysis. 
Theoretical advances and successful applications 
of the band theory of the solid state have recently 
led to a better understanding of the electronic 
properties of metallic oxides. In the field of cat- 
alysis the production of oxide semi-conductors with 
controlled electronic characteristics by Verwey 
and his school' discloses new possibilities, and 
affords a sound basis for attacking the problem of 
the relation between electronic states of oxides and 
their activity to catalyze chemical reactions. 
As a preliminary study in this field, the reduction

process of nickel oxide by hydrogen was investi- 
gated in order to obtain information on the effect 
of ionic and electronic defects in the solid phase 
on its reductive properties. The extensive in- 
vestigations of Pease and Taylor2 in the case of 
copper oxide, of Garner in the case of zinc oxide,3 
of Taylor and Starkweather4 and Benton and 
Emmett5 
in the case of nickel oxide have shown that 
the reduction processes of metallic oxides involve 
several different stages. In the case of nickel 
oxide, after an initial auto acceleration of the 
reduction rate, a constant value is obtained up to 
relatively high conversions. The present data 
refer mainly to this latter stage of the reductive 
process and clearly show how the reaction can be 
greatly affected by the defective structure of the 
solid phase.

Experimental Procedure 
Preparation of Samples.-In 
order to obtain comparable 
results all oxide samples were prepared under strictly con- 
trolled conditions. C.P. nitrates were dissolved in distilled 
water, the solutions being standardized in the usual way. 
The samples containing wolfram trioxide, nickel chloride 
and magnesium oxide were prepared from standard solutions 
of ammonium wolframate, nickel chloride and magnesium 
oxide dissolved in nitric acid. Calculated amounts of the 
standard solutions, corresponding to the desired percentage 
of oxide impurity in the final products were added to por- 
tions of the nickel nitrate solution. The mixed solutions 
were evaporated overnight at IIO', decomposed slowly by 
heating for four hours from room temperature to 400, fired 
in air at 640' for an additional three hours, and slowly 
cooled to room temperature. The oxide product was re- 
duced to granular form (q0-30 mesh). Pure nickel oxide 
samples were obtained by decomposing and firing nickel 
nitrate in an atmosphere of oxygen or alternatively in an 
atmosphere of helium. The helium was purified by being 
passed through a charcoal trap cooled to liquid nitrogen 
temperature and magnesium perchlorate. 
Nickel powder was obtained by reducing nickel oxide with 
purified hydrogen at 300' for 24 hours at a flow rate of 3 
liters per hour by cooling subsequently at room tempera- 
ture in an atmosphere of purified nitrogen. 
The gas used 
in the reduction experiments was tank hydrogen purified 
by passing through copper heated to 400, then calcium 
chloride, ascarite. phosphorus pentoxide and glass wool. 
Apparatus.-Reduction 
rates were measured in an all 
glass, closed system of 392 cc. total volume. The oxide was 
charged (0.483 g.) in a small reactor with built in preheating 
coil. Hydrogen was forced to circulate through the sample 
by means of a two-stage alternating mercury pump driven 
by an electrical motor. The displacement of the pump was 
about 10 cc. per sec., and under these conditions reduction 
rates were not affected by the pumping speed. Gold foils 
were placed in the system in order to trap any mercury vapor 
which might be present. 
After leaving the sample, the gas 
passed through a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen in order to 
condense the water formed. The ensuing change in pressure 
was followed on a mercury manometer, and the manometer 
readings were taken as an indication of the extent of the re- 
duction process. Reactor and preheating coil were kept at 
constant temperature by immersion in a thermostat ( 
0.2'), in which silicone oil (G.E. 9981 LNTV) was circulated 
by means of a thermosiphon device. 
Surface areas were measured by nitrogen adsorption and 
the results plotted according to B.E.T. theory. X-Ray 
data were obtained with an X-ray spectrometer using Fe 
radiation and Mn filter. In order to evaluate lattice dis- 
tortions (if any), duplicate patterns were taken for each 
sample, sodium chloride being used as an internal standard. 
Measurements of particle size were carried out on the strong- 
est spinel (NiCr20,) line (2.08 A.) 
using Brill's formula. 
The reproducibility in the determination of the velocity 
constants (g. nickel oxide reduced per minute) was found 
to be better than 5%. The experimental error in determin- 
ing the activation energies was 30.9 
kcal./mole. 
Experimental Results 
The data obtained for the reduction of nickel oxide at 
different temperatures and constant initial pressure of hy- 
drogen (470 mm.) are presented in Fig. 1. No effect on the 
rate has been detected by a preliminary irradiation of nickel 
oxide with the full light of a mercury lamp (3 hours at room 
temperature). At constant temperature the rate of reduc- 
tion was a linear function of the initial pressure of hydrogen 
in the range 200-500 mm. Similar results have been ob- 
tained in the case of a chromia containing sample (Fig. 2).

Discussion 
The results presented in Fig. 1 
are in accord with 
previous work on the reduction of 
metallic 
 oxide.! After an incubation and an induction 
period a linear law of reduction applies up to high 
conversion values. This can be explained by con- 
sidering that in the present case the ratio6 R = 
Vr/ Vi = 0.84, where Vf, Vi are the specific volumes 
of the final product and initial reactant. If R < 
1 
a film o
f
 the product cannot be stable up to large 
values of conversion and fresh surface will always 
be present due to collapsing of the film. When, 
however, a metallic film is formed, the transport 
of matter by diffusion through this layer becomes 
rate determining, and the over-all process is best 
represented by a parabolic type of law (Figs. 4,5). 
The following steps can be envisaged as occurring 
during the course of the reduction process: (a) 
adsorption of hydrogen on the surface, (b) reaction 
between adsorbed hydrogen and nickel oxide with 
formation of water and metallic nuclei, (c) evapora- 
tion of water. Process (b) as well as the growth 
of the nuclei formed are accomplished by migration 
of nickel ions and electrons. 
Wagner7 has shown that the concentration 
gradient of excess zinc in zinc oxide in contact with 
oxygen does not vary appreciably with the oxygen 
pressure. I

Fig. 6.-The 
effect of the amount of p-type character of nickel oxide on the activation energy for its reduction. 
in the case of nickel oxide in the presence of hy- 
drogen and if material diffusion or water evapora- 
tion were rate determining then the reduction rate 
of nickel oxide should be almost independent of 
hydrogen pressure. Supporting evidence in this 
respect is given by the fact that addition of me- 
tallic nickel produces no effect on the induction 
period for nickel oxide reduction in contrast to the 
findings of Pease and Taylor2 
for copper oxide. 
Furthermore, the addition of a trivalent cation 
(Cr+3) increases the number of cation vacancies 
in the nickel oxide lattice. Accordingly, the ionic 
conductivity will increase and likewise the diffusion 
rate. This is just the opposite of what it has been 
found. These considerations indicate that proc- 
esses (b) and (c) are not, under the present experi- 
mental conditions, rate determining. Process (c) 
however, can become significant at low pressures, 
where the mechanism of reduction must be different 
from that occurring at higher pressures. It 
seems therefore that process (a), the irreversible 
chemisorption of hydrogen, determines the rate 
of the reduction process. 
According to this interpretation of the experi- 
mental data, it becomes clear that the initial auto- 
catalytic rise of the rate is due to increasing surface 
coverage by hydrogen. This is a non-equilibrium 
process at any stage of the reaction. 
Nickel oxide is known to be an electron defect 
semiconductor, containing in its lattice cationic 
holes (0 
(Ni+")> and an electrically equivalent 
number o
f
 electron holes (O(e-)). 
Its p-type 
character can be modified and controlled to a 
certain extent by incorporation in the lattice of 
suitable impurities. Recent data by Verweyl 
and Hauffe8 have clearly shown the effect of the 
incorporation of foreign ions on the semi-conduc- 
tivity of nickel oxide. These authors were able to 
demonstrate that. the semi-conductivity can be 
increased by the introduction of monovalent cations 
(Li+), while cations with higher valency than two 
( C r 9  have the reverse effect. An opposite be- 
havior is to be expected as far as cationic holes are 
concerned. This can be seen from the following 
relations derived by Hauffe from the electro- 
neutrality principle applied to the nickel oxide 
lattice : 
[O(Nif2)] X [O(e-')I2 = const. (at constant Po2 and 
temperature) 
Our significant experimental data are the follow- 
ing: (1) The rate of reduction is decreased by 
igniting the "pure" oxide in an helium atmosphere 
as compared to that of a sample ignited in air or 
(8)

oxygen. The activation energy, however, remains 
the same. (2) The rate is decreased in almost 
all cases by the addition of foreign ions. (3) The 
activation energy is decreased by the addition of 
higher valency cations (CI-+, 
W+6) 
or lower valency 
anions (Cl-), while it is increased by lower valency 
cations (Li f, 
Agf). (
4
)
 
Increasing concentrations 
of Lif decrease the rate and increase the activation 
energy, while increasing concentrations of Cr 
+3 
(up to a certain value) have no effect upon either. 
( 5 )  The addition of Mgf2 decreases the rate and 
slightly affects the activation energy. 
Th+4 
have no effect on either the rate or the activa- 
tion energy. 
Point (1) can be explained by considering that in 
the case of "pure" nickel oxide the rate of reduction 
depends on the number of positive holes only. 
At the surface the positive holes are destroyed by 
chemisorption of hydrogen. They diffuse from the 
bulk to the surface under a concentration gradient 
or space charge effect. This process is very rapid, 
because they can cross diffusion barriers by tunnel 
effect. 
On the other hand the present data show that in 
the case of samples containing foreign ions a direct 
correlation between the number of positive holes 
in the oxides and its rate of reduction cannot be 
deduced. Furthermore, it must be pointed out 
that the present rate data are not in agreement 
with those of Wagnerg and Hauffe'O on the effect 
of additions of foreign ions to the rate of oxidation 
of nickel and zinc metals. These authors find a 
definite relation between the type of addition and 
the rate of oxidation. This disagreement empha- 
sizes the fundamental difference between the 
mechanism of oxidation of nickel metal and the 
reduction of the oxide by hydrogen. 
The values of the activation energy show a 
definite trend when compared to the change in p- 
type behavior of nickel oxide obtained by the addi- 
tion of foreign ions (Fig. 6)."Monovalent cations 
increase, while cations'with a valency higher than 
two decrease the activation energy of the process. 
The reverse effect is obtained by introducing 
foreign anions into the nickel oxide lattice. It is 
believed that this fact can only be explained by 
assuming that the impurity centers of foreign ions 
interact with hydrogen surface states. No theore- 
tical explanation is at present available for this 
effect. An almost continuous distribution of 
energy among impurity levels has been assumed 
by Meyer" and Busch12 to explain the mechanism

affect the activation energy of the reduction proc- 
ess. In fact, it has been found by Verwey' that 
the activation energy for semi-conductivity in 
lithia containing samples decreases with increasing 
content of lithia, while Hauffe* 
found that the acti- 
vation energy for semi-conductivity is not affected 
by the presence of chromia. 
In order that foreign ions should affect the re- 
ductive properties of nickel oxide, they have to be 
randomly distributed over its lattice. I
f
 a phase 
separation occurs, no effect is to be expected. 
This will be the case if the increase in energy to 
form a preferred grouping or a chemical compound 
with nickel oxide is larger than that obtained by 
a strictly statistical distribution of foreign ions in 
the nickel oxide lattice. Our results show that 
phase separation occurs during the addition of 1 
mole % alumina and 1 
mole % thoria. In the case 
of cliroiiiia it is kiiowii that its limiting solubility 
in nickel oxide is about 1 mole %.6 
This explains 
the similar behavior of 1 mole yo and 5 mole % 
chromia containing samples. Higher activation 
energies, however, were obtained at higher chromia 
concentrations (25 mole yo). This occurs at 
concentrations where sizable amounts of spinel 
are formed, as evidenced by X-ray analysis. At 
present no data are available on the electrical 
characteristics of nickel chromite, and therefore its 
effect on these properties o
f
 nickel oxide cannot be 
predicted. 
On the basis of the present results it can be 
concluded that a direct correlation exists between 
the activation energy for reduction of nickel oxide 
by hydrogen and the type of addition. 
The same and opposite effects can probably be 
predicted for other p-type and n-type oxides re- 
spectively. However, there are at present no 
experimental data to support these predictions.

The Solubility of Cadmium in Mixtures of Cadmium Chloride with Other Chlorides

of the metal 
and the electropositiveness of the metal of the cation. An hypothesis as to the structure of the solutions is considered. 
The solubilities of the metals of group I1 of the 
Periodic Table in their molten chlorides have been 
shown to increase with increasing ionic radius of 
the cation.2 It has also been shown3 that for 
cations of similar size the solubility of the metal 
increases as the ratio of the number of anions to 
cations in the salt increases. 
The author was interested in investigating the 
solubility of a metal in the chlorides of other 
metals or in mixtures of chlorides. Such meas- 
urements may lead to a better understanding of 
the nature of metal in salt 
solutions. 
It was necessary to choose a metal that was 
reasonably soluble in its chloride and yet one that 
would not reduce salts equilibrated with it. Cad- 
mium metal has such properties. It was a simple 
matter to select salts that had proper anion to 
cation ratios. 
To determine whether they would 
be reduced by cadmium metal, their free energies 
of formation were compared with that of cadmium 
chloride. Table I gives the standard free energies 
of formation and the equilibrium constant for the 
reaction involving one mole of cadmium with the 
salt. 
All the chlorides except that of zinc have an 
equilibrium constant small enough so that the 
possibility of reduction of the salt by cadmium may 
be overlooked.

Experimental 
Method.-The 
solubilities were determined at 740" by 
equilibrating cadmium with the salt in a closed iron tube, 
quenching it in water, and analyzing a sample of the salt 
phase. 
An iron test-tube was made by flattening one end of 
a 5" X 1/2" iron tube and sealing the bottom with a spot 
welder. About 10 g. of cadmium and 15 g. of salt mixture, 
made up by weight from the components, were put in the 
tube in a dry-box. 
The top of the tube was then flattened 
and sealed by spot welding. The tube was heated at 740 f 
10' for one hour and then quenched in water. The pressure 
in the iron tube reached several atmospheres because of the 
air and vapors trapped within, and some of the welded 
joints leaked. The tubes that leaked were readily detected 
because water seeped in during quenching. 
The tube containing the quenched sample was then cut
