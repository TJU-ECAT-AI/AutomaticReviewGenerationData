[1] "Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on the catalytic performance"

[2] "The same sintering treatment caused the activity of YSZ containing trace of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is due to segregation of the impurities to the surface, which either blocks active surface of YSZ catalyst or forms new phases with different catalytic properties."

The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. However, it does provide insights into how impurities and additives can affect catalyst performance, which has implications for our understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design.

The text mentions that impurities like CaO, TiO2, and Na2O can significantly influence the catalytic performance of yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). These impurities can segregate to the surface during high-temperature treatments, either blocking active sites or forming new phases with different catalytic properties. This suggests that throughout the history of catalysis, the presence of unintended impurities may have inadvertently created doped oxide catalysts, potentially leading to unexpected or unexplained catalytic behaviors.

This historical perspective implies that many catalytic processes might have been influenced by unrecognized dopants, highlighting the importance of thorough characterization and understanding of catalyst composition in modern catalyst design. It emphasizes the need for careful control of impurities during catalyst synthesis and processing, as even trace amounts can significantly alter catalytic properties.

Furthermore, this understanding can be leveraged in the intentional design of doped oxide catalysts, where specific impurities or additives can be introduced to enhance catalytic performance or create new functionalities. The development of advanced characterization techniques, such as XRF and LEIS mentioned in the text, has been crucial in revealing these subtle but important effects of dopants and impurities on catalyst surfaces.

In conclusion, while the historical use of unintentionally doped oxide catalysts is not explicitly discussed, the information provided underscores the complex role of impurities in catalysis and the importance of this knowledge in modern catalyst design and optimization.

虽然文献没有直接讨论非故意使用掺杂氧化物催化剂的历史视角,但它确实提供了关于杂质和添加剂如何影响催化剂性能的见解,这对我们理解催化过程和现代催化剂设计有重要意义。

文中提到,像CaO、TiO2和Na2O这样的杂质可以显著影响钇稳定氧化锆(YSZ)的催化性能。这些杂质在高温处理过程中可能会迁移到表面,要么阻塞活性位点,要么形成具有不同催化性质的新相。这表明,在催化历史中,无意中存在的杂质可能inadvertently创造了掺杂的氧化物催化剂,可能导致意外或无法解释的催化行为。

这一历史视角意味着许多催化过程可能受到未被认识的掺杂剂的影响,突出了在现代催化剂设计中彻底表征和理解催化剂成分的重要性。它强调了在催化剂合成和加工过程中需要仔细控制杂质,因为即使微量杂质也可能显著改变催化性能。

此外,这种理解可以应用于有意设计掺杂氧化物催化剂,通过引入特定的杂质或添加剂来增强催化性能或创造新功能。文中提到的XRF和LEIS等先进表征技术的发展,对揭示掺杂剂和杂质对催化剂表面的这些微妙但重要的影响起到了关键作用。

总之,虽然没有明确讨论非故意使用掺杂氧化物催化剂的历史,但所提供的信息强调了杂质在催化中的复杂作用,以及这些知识在现代催化剂设计和优化中的重要性。
