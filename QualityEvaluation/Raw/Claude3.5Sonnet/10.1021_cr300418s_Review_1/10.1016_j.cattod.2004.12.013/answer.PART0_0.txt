[1] "Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on the catalytic performance"

[2] "The same sintering treatment caused the activity of YSZ containing trace of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is due to segregation of the impurities to the surface, which either blocks active surface of YSZ catalyst or forms new phases with different catalytic properties."

The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide insights into how impurities can significantly impact catalyst performance, which has implications for our understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design.

The text mentions that impurities such as CaO, TiO2, and Na2O can profoundly influence the catalytic performance of yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) catalysts. This suggests that throughout the history of catalysis, unintentional doping of oxide catalysts with impurities may have played a crucial role in their performance, potentially leading to unexpected results or variations in catalytic activity.

The literature also notes that trace amounts of earth alkali oxides can cause the activity of YSZ catalysts to collapse when subjected to sintering treatments. This highlights the sensitivity of catalysts to even small amounts of impurities and the importance of understanding their effects.

These observations imply that our current understanding of catalytic processes must account for the potential impact of impurities and unintentional doping. For modern catalyst design, this historical perspective emphasizes the need for:

1. Careful control and characterization of catalyst composition, including trace impurities.
2. Understanding the effects of impurities on catalyst performance and stability.
3. Potentially leveraging intentional doping to enhance catalyst properties.
4. Considering the role of impurities in interpreting historical catalytic data and replicating past results.

Overall, this perspective underscores the complexity of catalyst systems and the importance of a holistic approach to catalyst design and characterization.

虽然文献没有直接讨论氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史视角，但它提供了关于杂质如何显著影响催化剂性能的见解，这对我们理解催化过程和现代催化剂设计有重要影响。

文本提到，像CaO、TiO2和Na2O这样的杂质可以深刻影响钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）催化剂的催化性能。这表明，在催化历史中，氧化物催化剂的无意掺杂可能在其性能中起到了关键作用，可能导致了意外结果或催化活性的变化。

文献还指出，微量的碱土金属氧化物可能导致YSZ催化剂在烧结处理后活性崩溃。这突显了催化剂对即使是少量杂质的敏感性，以及理解其影响的重要性。

这些观察结果意味着，我们当前对催化过程的理解必须考虑到杂质和无意掺杂的潜在影响。对于现代催化剂设计，这一历史视角强调了以下需求：

1. 仔细控制和表征催化剂成分，包括微量杂质。
2. 理解杂质对催化剂性能和稳定性的影响。
3. 可能利用有意掺杂来增强催化剂性能。
4. 在解释历史催化数据和复制过去结果时考虑杂质的作用。

总的来说，这一视角强调了催化剂系统的复杂性，以及采用整体方法进行催化剂设计和表征的重要性。
