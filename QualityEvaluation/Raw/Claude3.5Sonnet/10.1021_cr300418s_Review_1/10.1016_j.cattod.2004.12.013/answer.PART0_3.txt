[1] "Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on the catalytic performance"

[2] "As long as YSZ catalyst was not contaminated, the composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ was independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and calcination temperature; the surface always contained 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."

[3] "The same sintering treatment caused the activity of YSZ containing trace of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is due to segregation of the impurities to the surface, which either blocks active surface of YSZ catalyst or forms new phases with different catalytic properties."

The literature provides some insight into how impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis:

1. Impurities like CaO, TiO2, and Na2O can significantly influence the catalytic performance of materials like yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).

2. The segregation of additives (like Y2O3 in YSZ) to the surface can occur independently of bulk composition, leading to unintended surface doping.

3. Trace impurities of earth alkali oxides can dramatically alter catalyst activity through surface segregation, either by blocking active sites or forming new phases with different properties.

These observations have important implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design:

1. The importance of surface composition: Even trace impurities can significantly affect catalyst performance, highlighting the need for careful surface characterization in addition to bulk analysis.

2. Unintended doping effects: Historical catalysts may have benefited (or suffered) from unintended doping effects due to impurities, which may explain some inconsistencies in early catalysis research.

3. Controlled doping: Understanding these mechanisms allows for more intentional and controlled doping strategies in modern catalyst design.

4. Purity requirements: The sensitivity to impurities underscores the importance of high-purity precursors and controlled synthesis conditions in catalyst preparation.

5. Complex structure-property relationships: The interplay between bulk and surface composition, as well as the effects of calcination and other treatments, points to the complexity of structure-property relationships in heterogeneous catalysis.

This historical perspective emphasizes the need for advanced characterization techniques, careful control of synthesis conditions, and consideration of both intentional and unintentional doping effects in the development of modern catalysts.

文献为我们提供了一些关于杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂中如何在催化历史中促进了无意识掺杂氧化物催化剂使用的见解：

1. 像CaO、TiO2和Na2O这样的杂质可以显著影响诸如钇稳定氧化锆(YSZ)等材料的催化性能。

2. 添加剂（如YSZ中的Y2O3）向表面的偏析可以独立于体相成分而发生，导致意外的表面掺杂。

3. 微量的碱土金属氧化物杂质可以通过表面偏析显著改变催化剂活性，要么阻塞活性位点，要么形成具有不同性质的新相。

这些观察对我们当前对催化过程的理解和现代催化剂设计有重要意义：

1. 表面组成的重要性：即使是微量杂质也能显著影响催化剂性能，突显了除体相分析外还需要进行仔细的表面表征的需求。

2. 意外的掺杂效应：历史上的催化剂可能因杂质而受益（或受损）于意外的掺杂效应，这可能解释了早期催化研究中的一些不一致性。

3. 受控掺杂：理解这些机制允许在现代催化剂设计中采用更有意识和更受控的掺杂策略。

4. 纯度要求：对杂质的敏感性强调了在催化剂制备中使用高纯度前驱体和控制合成条件的重要性。

5. 复杂的结构-性能关系：体相和表面成分之间的相互作用，以及煅烧和其他处理的影响，表明了多相催化中结构-性能关系的复杂性。

这种历史视角强调了在开发现代催化剂时需要先进的表征技术、对合成条件的仔细控制，以及对有意和无意掺杂效应的考虑。
