[1] "Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on the catalytic performance"

[2] "As long as YSZ catalyst was not contaminated, the composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ was independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and calcination temperature; the surface always contained 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."

[3] "The same sintering treatment caused the activity of YSZ containing trace of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is due to segregation of the impurities to the surface, which either blocks active surface of YSZ catalyst or forms new phases with different catalytic properties."

The literature provides some insight into how impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis:

1. Impurities like CaO, TiO2, and Na2O can significantly influence the catalytic performance of materials like yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).

2. Surface segregation of additives (e.g., Y2O3 in YSZ) can occur independently of bulk composition, leading to consistent surface compositions that may differ from the intended bulk composition.

3. Trace amounts of impurities, particularly earth alkali oxides, can drastically alter catalyst activity through surface segregation, either by blocking active sites or forming new phases with different properties.

These observations have important implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design:

1. Historical catalytic results may have been influenced by unrecognized impurities or surface segregation effects, potentially leading to misinterpretations of structure-activity relationships.

2. The importance of surface composition, as opposed to bulk composition, in determining catalytic activity is highlighted, emphasizing the need for surface-sensitive characterization techniques in catalyst development.

3. Careful control and characterization of impurities and additives are crucial in catalyst design, as even trace amounts can significantly alter performance.

4. The potential for deliberately engineering surface compositions through controlled doping or inducing surface segregation opens new avenues for catalyst design and optimization.

5. Understanding the historical context of unintentional doping effects can guide more intentional and precise approaches to catalyst development in modern research.

文献为我们提供了一些见解，说明氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂如何在整个催化历史中促成了掺杂氧化物催化剂的无意使用：

1. 像CaO、TiO2和Na2O这样的杂质可以显著影响钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）等材料的催化性能。

2. 添加剂（如YSZ中的Y2O3）的表面偏析可能独立于体相组成而发生，导致表面组成一致，但可能与预期的体相组成不同。

3. 微量杂质，特别是碱土金属氧化物，可以通过表面偏析大幅改变催化剂活性，要么阻塞活性位点，要么形成具有不同性质的新相。

这些观察对我们当前对催化过程的理解和现代催化剂设计的发展有重要意义：

1. 历史上的催化结果可能受到未被认识的杂质或表面偏析效应的影响，可能导致对结构-活性关系的误解。

2. 强调了表面组成相对于体相组成在决定催化活性方面的重要性，突出了在催化剂开发中使用表面敏感表征技术的必要性。

3. 在催化剂设计中，仔细控制和表征杂质和添加剂至关重要，因为即使是微量也可能显著改变性能。

4. 通过控制掺杂或诱导表面偏析来有意设计表面组成的潜力为催化剂设计和优化开辟了新途径。

5. 理解无意掺杂效应的历史背景可以指导现代研究中更有意识和精确的催化剂开发方法。
