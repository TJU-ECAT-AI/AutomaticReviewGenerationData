[1] "Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on the catalytic performance"

[2] "As long as YSZ catalyst was not contaminated, the composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ was independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and calcination temperature; the surface always contained 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."

[3] "The same sintering treatment caused the activity of YSZ containing trace of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is due to segregation of the impurities to the surface, which either blocks active surface of YSZ catalyst or forms new phases with different catalytic properties."

The literature provides some insights into how impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis:

1. Impurities like CaO, TiO2, and Na2O can significantly influence catalytic performance of materials like yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ).

2. Surface segregation of additives (like Y2O3 in YSZ) can occur during calcination, leading to surface compositions that differ from bulk compositions. This could result in unintended doping effects at catalyst surfaces.

3. Trace amounts of impurities, particularly earth alkali oxides, can dramatically impact catalyst activity through surface segregation and blocking of active sites or formation of new phases.

These findings have important implications for our understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design:

1. Historical catalytic results may need to be reevaluated considering the potential impacts of unrecognized impurities or surface segregation effects.

2. Careful characterization of catalyst surfaces, not just bulk compositions, is crucial for understanding true catalytic behavior.

3. Intentional doping or careful purification may be necessary to control surface compositions and optimize catalytic performance.

4. The complex interactions between additives, impurities, and catalyst surfaces highlight the need for advanced surface characterization techniques in catalyst development.

5. Understanding these effects opens new possibilities for catalyst design by intentionally leveraging surface segregation and doping to create desired catalytic properties.

这篇文献为我们提供了一些见解，说明氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂如何在催化历史中导致了无意中使用掺杂氧化物催化剂：

1. 像CaO、TiO2和Na2O这样的杂质可以显著影响诸如钇稳定氧化锆（YSZ）等材料的催化性能。

2. 在煅烧过程中可能发生添加剂（如YSZ中的Y2O3）的表面偏析，导致表面组成与体相组成不同。这可能在催化剂表面产生意外的掺杂效应。

3. 微量杂质，特别是碱土金属氧化物，可以通过表面偏析和阻塞活性位点或形成新相，对催化剂活性产生巨大影响。

这些发现对我们理解催化过程和现代催化剂设计有重要意义：

1. 考虑到未被认识的杂质或表面偏析效应的潜在影响，可能需要重新评估历史上的催化结果。

2. 仔细表征催化剂表面，而不仅仅是体相组成，对于理解真实的催化行为至关重要。

3. 可能需要有意掺杂或仔细纯化来控制表面组成并优化催化性能。

4. 添加剂、杂质和催化剂表面之间的复杂相互作用强调了在催化剂开发中需要先进的表面表征技术。

5. 理解这些效应为催化剂设计开辟了新的可能性，可以有意利用表面偏析和掺杂来创造所需的催化特性。
