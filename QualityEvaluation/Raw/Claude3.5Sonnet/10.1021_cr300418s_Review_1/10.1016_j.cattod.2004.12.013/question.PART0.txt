Abstract
This short review provides an overview as well as background of ongoing work in our laboratory on unconventional catalysts in selective
oxidation reactions with remarkable selectivity. The three cases reviewed here have in common that the catalysts are oxides that do not posses
any formal redox capacity.
The use of doped defective oxides gives rise to surface-redox chemistry in the case of partial oxidation of methane over yttrium-modified
zirconia, where actual removal of oxygen from the surface sites indeed takes place. Surprisingly, this oxygen species is not able to activate
hydrogen to a significant extent. In contrast, Li-modified MgO catalyst does not allow removal of oxygen; O sites generated by Li are now
able to abstract a H-radical from, e.g., propane. Radical gas-phase chemistry of the propyl radicals is then responsible for selective formation
of olefins. The significant fact in this case is that olefins are activated to a lesser extent then alkanes.
The remarkable selectivity obtained in propane oxygenation on earth-alkali-modified zeolite Yat unusually low temperatures is due to the
confinement of radicals in the cages of the zeolite, turning radical chemistry into stoichiometric chemistry. The second significant effect is the
very effective stabilization of the resulting oxygenate, acetone, in the cage. However, the stabilization thus also implies extremely strong
adsorption of the acetone, thus preventing desorption of the product. Our work indicates that desorption can be assisted by offering water as a
competitive adsorbing species, thus opening the possibility to close the catalytic cycle.

1. Introduction
Catalytic selective oxidation processes account for about
a quarter of the industrial production of monomers and
chemical intermediates. The total turnover of this business is
in the order of 50 billion dollars per year (1998), evenly
distributed over America, Europe and Asia [1]. Efficient
operation
of
these
processes
therefore
has
a
major
commercial and environmental impact and the catalysts
used are key to obtain sufficient efficiency.
Most catalysts used in these industrial processes are
based on mixed metal oxides. Typically, direct oxidation of
hydrocarbons
by
O2
gives
poor
selectivity
at
high
conversion, which limits conversion to a few percent in
most practical situations. The inefficiency associated with
low conversion has motivated the search for solid catalysts
with higher activity in selective oxidation of hydrocarbons
[2]. Driving forces for new breakthroughs are:
 Selectivity control; lack of selectivity is severe if
conversion is pushed due to over-oxidation of partially
oxidized products [3]. This is caused by the general
phenomenon that the product molecules are more reactive
than the reactants to be activated [1].
 Use of cheaper and easily available raw materials, e.g.,
lower alkanes such as methane, ethane and propane. This
is very challenging because alkanes are difficult to
activate, and thus the severe conditions required make the
quest for selectivity even more urgent. The underlying
motivation is the better use of natural gas and volatile
petroleum fractions [46].
 Environmental constraints; development of processes that
produce less waste and have greater safety is essential.

Several concepts to improve selectivity have been pro-
posed, especially for alkanes, e.g., the use of alternative
oxidants (N2O, peroxides, ozone e.g.), site isolation, multi-
staged dosing of oxygen, spatial separation of the reduction
and oxidation steps for redox catalysts and integration of
reaction and product-separation in membrane reactors. In
many cases it seems difficult to prevent the unacceptably
high cost of these new approaches.
This short review describes work over the last decade in
our laboratory on an alternative approach: i.e., the use of
oxides that formally do not have any redox properties as
oxidation catalysts. On the one hand we will discuss the
application of defect oxides at relatively high temperatures,
i.e., LiMgO for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and
cracking of light alkanes and yttria-stabilized ZrO2 for
catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. On
the other hand we will discuss the use of zeolite-Y modified
with alkaline earth metals in the selective oxygenation of
alkanes at unusually low temperatures, i.e., room tempera-
ture.
2. ODH-cracking on LiMgO
The present industrial capacity for lower olefins such as
propene, butenes is expected to be insufficient as the demand
for
these
important
building
blocks
in
the
modern
petrochemical industry grows [7]. These light olefins (along
with methane and aromatics) are, e.g., obtained from
catalytic or steam cracking of naphtha and from FCC in oil
refining. While these two routes are very well developed,
increasing the capacity of these processes is limited.
Dehydrogenation of alkanes, an alternative route to light
olefins, shows some major disadvantages, i.e., the reaction
yields are equilibrium limited, a high tendency to coking and
consequently short catalyst lifetime. Oxidative dehydro-
genation is conceptually an interesting route as limitations
by the chemical equilibrium are removed by the coupling of
dehydrogenation and hydrogen oxidation; moreover, the
presence of oxygen limits coking and extends therefore
catalyst lifetimes. Conventional transition metal oxides with
pronounced redox properties such as supported vanadia
catalysts have been explored [8]. Results have not been
promising, as re-adsorption of olefins (leading to sequential/
total oxidation) appears to limit the olefin yields to below
35% [9].
In contrast, recent reports [10,11] show that magnesia-
based catalysts containing rare-earth oxides, promoted with
alkali halide (mainly chlorides) show high activity and
selectivity in comparison to other mixed oxides for forming
olefins. For LPG range hydrocarbons, these catalysts yielded
up to 50% of total olefins at 600 8C at 62% conversion.
While the catalysts showed only a minor tendency to form
carbon oxides, catalyst stability was still not satisfactory.
Our own results [12] with propane show that presence of
Cl is not essential for the high olefin yields obtained, and in
the absence of chlorine the stability of the catalyst is further
improved. High olefin selectivity is maintained even at high
conversions over LiMgO catalyst, very little secondary
conversion of olefins formed to COx occurs [13] (Fig. 1).
2.1. Active site
The activity and selectivity increase with Li addition, as
shown in Fig. 2. Addition of up to 3 wt.% Li2O onto
magnesia increases the rate of propane conversion normal-
ized to catalyst surface area. Based on observations on the
inhibition of the reaction by CO2 and from the interaction of
the catalyst with CO2 in TPD experiments at reaction

temperatures, it was concluded that Li is part of the active
site. It was proposed that [Li+O]-type active sites, as
defects on the MgO surface, are responsible for catalytic
activity, similar to the active site in methane oxidative
coupling [10]. Furthermore, in the kinetic analysis of
propane conversion, a strong correlation between catalytic
activity and CO2 concentration was found. It was proposed
that [Li+CO3
] is formed on the [Li+O] active site based on
the observation that CO2 showed a minus one order in the
conversion rate of propane [13].
Quantification of the amount of [Li+O] active sites in the
catalysts was achieved by two methods. The first consisted
of the removal of the oxygen from the active site by
reduction with hydrogen and subsequent re-oxidation. The
second
method
involved
the
decomposition
of
the
[Li+CO3
] species, which is formed and is stable at
600 8C only when CO2 is present. Bulk Li2CO3 phase is, in
contrast, thermally stable at 600 8C. Adsorptiondesorption
studies
at
600 8C
therefore
allow
quantification
of
[Li+CO3
] through differentiation from bulk Li2CO3.
Catalytic activity is thus attributed to the oxygen present
in the [Li+O] site. This is demonstrated by the linear
correlation of the reaction rates with the density of [Li+O]
sites (Fig. 2b). However, the question regarding the location
of the [Li+O] active site remains.
2.2. Reaction mechanism
Activation of propane on the [Li+O] active site takes
place by splitting one CH bond in propane while forming
[Li+OH] and a propyl radical, that is released into the gas
phase where it undergoes radical-chain propagation reac-
tions. It appears that the rate-determining step in the reaction
pathways
to
propene,
ethene
and
methane
involves
activation of propane on the catalyst surface [12].
Oxygen present increases the number and the concentra-
tion of the chain carrier radicals. When oxygen is not present
H and CH3 radicals are the main chain propagators. In the
presence of oxygen the i-propyl radical reacts fast with the
oxygen molecule forming a hydroperoxyl (HO2
) radical
and propene. The hydroperoxy radical further reacts with a
new propane molecule forming H2O2, which by decom-
position gives two hydroxyl radicals (OH). Hydroxyl
radicals become the main chain propagator and it forms
water by reacting with a propane molecule.
Regeneration of the [Li+OH] sites occurs in the
presence of oxygen without the removal of the O of the
active site [13,14], which would be typical in a conventional
redox catalyst.
Importantly, the amount of propane converted over a pre-
oxidized catalyst, oxygen in the gas phase being absent, is 70
times higher than the number of removable oxygen sites.
This fact supports a radical-chain mechanism in which one
propane molecule is activated on the active site resulting in
propyl radical which undergoes chain-propagation reactions
in the gas phase. The number 70 is a typical chain-
propagation length in homogeneous chemistry [15].
To summarize, LiMgO catalyst does not posses the
conventional redox type nature of oxidic selective oxidation
catalysts. The alkane oxidative dehydrogenation follows an
initial activation on the catalyst, resulting in radicals which
undergo chain reactions in the gas phase. This route
minimizes combustion and enhances olefin yields as olefins
are activated to much lesser extent then alkanes. Defect
chemistry, i.e., presence of [Li+O]-type sites on MgO, is
the key to the functioning of these new, highly efficient
catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to
olefins. The extent of COx formation is however still too high
for commercial application as the separation of COx from
olefins is costly. Current activities in our lab aim on further
suppressing the COx formation based on a better under-
standing of the structureperformance relationship and
improved control in the preparation of the catalysts. One
approach is to maximize the concentration of [Li+O] active
sites, e.g., by varying the morphology of the catalyst;
another approach is to minimize CO2 formation after the
reaction pathway to CO2 has been identified.
3. CPO on YZrO2
The large amount of natural gas found worldwide has
recently led to extensive research in the area of methane
conversion. None of the catalytic processes proposed for
methane utilization in one single step, e.g., oxidative
coupling, partial oxidation to methanol or formaldehyde, is
yet mature for industrial exploitation [16] due to the limited
yields. Therefore, indirect utilization of natural gas has
attracted more attention. Catalytic partial oxidation of
methane to synthesis gas (CPOM) is an attractive option
among these indirect transformation routes, because of its
mild exothermic heat of reaction and suitable H2/CO ratio
for downstream processes such as methanol synthesis and
FischerTropsch synthesis. A considerable amount of work
concerning the reaction mechanism of CPOM over metallic
catalysts has been carried out. Two general mechanisms for
the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas have been
proposed. The so-called indirect mechanism claims that
methane is combusted to CO2 and H2O, followed by both
steam and carbon dioxide reforming [17,18] as consecutive
reactions. The direct mechanism proposed by Schmidt
and co-workers [1921] assumes that methane is directly
converted to CO and H2, without initial deep oxidation. This
issue is important because the indirect mechanism will cause
huge temperature gradients in the reactor.
Metallic catalysts suffer from deactivation by sintering of
metal and/or support and from evaporation of the metal in
the form of volatile metal oxide formed at very high
temperatures, especially in the present of oxygen [22,23].
The same problem occurs in the ammonia oxidation process
over PtRh gauzes operated at similar conditions as CPOM

65
[24]. Furthermore, precious metal-based catalysts are more
sensitive for poisoning with, e.g., sulfur and halogens then
zirconia, as illustrated by a recent patent on the oxidative
removal of ammonia and tar from gasified biomass and
waste with zirconia as the preferred catalyst [25].
Steghuis [26] and Stobbe [27] investigated oxidation of
methane over some oxide catalysts, such as ZrO2, Y2O3,
La2O3/ZrO2, yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and TiO2.
Among these irreducible oxides, YSZ was the most active
catalyst for CPOM. These catalysts show lower activity and
selectivity compared to metal catalysts. However, catalyst
stability is superior and the issue of lower selectivity can be
dealt with by introducing a second metal-based reforming
catalyst that can be kept stable because contact with oxygen
at high temperatures is avoided [28].
Stobbe [27] concluded, based on the relation between
methane conversion and selectivities over ZrO2, that CO and
H2 are primary products of CPOM over ZrO2, whereas CO2
was formed by water-gas shift and oxidation of CO. Steghuis
[26] proposed a reaction mechanism of CPOM over YSZ,
including homolitic dissociation of methane over O
S sites
followed by conversion to CO, H2 and H2O via the formation
and decomposition of formaldehyde as an intermediate. CO2
was
produced
by
further
oxidation
of
the
reaction
intermediate, but not via oxidation of CO.
The linear relationship between yields and conversion
(Fig. 3) shows that the four major products, CO, H2, CO2 and
H2O over yttrium-stabilized zirconia are all primary
products. Surprisingly, methane is more effectively activated
than H2 on this catalyst.
Besides these major products, traces of hydrocarbons,
formaldehyde and formic acid were also observed in the
product mixture, especially at high reaction temperatures
[29]. In situ IR studies showed that formate was formed by
activation of methane on the surface of YSZ catalyst at
temperatures between 400 and 475 8C, i.e., under conditions
that do not allow a significant steady-state reaction rate.
Adsorbed formaldehyde was not observed, probably due to
rapid conversion to formate. Temperature-programmed
desorption/decomposition (TPD/TPDE) of formate resulted
in an essentially identical mixture of CO, CO2, H2 and H2O
as compared to the product mixture in steady-state CPOM.
Addition of formaldehyde to the CPOM reaction mixture
caused the yields of CO, CO2 and H2 to increase without
influencing the product distribution. These observations are
strong indications that CH2O and formate are indeed
intermediate products. Activation of methane appears to be
the rate-determining step at 600 8C and higher temperatures.
When temperature is decreased the rate-determining step
shifts to the decomposition of formate.
Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the
influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the
enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities
such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on
the catalytic performance [30]. Creation of active sites by
doping with Y2O3 improved the catalytic performance of
ZrO2 significantly. The surface composition rather than the
bulk composition determined the catalytic performance of
the catalysts in CPOM. As long as YSZ catalyst was not
contaminated, the composition of the outermost surface of
calcined YSZ was independent of both the concentration of
Y2O3 in the bulk and calcination temperature; the surface
always contained 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of
Y2O3. Calcination at higher temperatures created more
active sites per m2, while the catalyst lost surface area via
sintering. The same sintering treatment caused the activity of
YSZ containing trace of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse.
The effect is due to segregation of the impurities to the
surface, which either blocks active surface of YSZ catalyst
or forms new phases with different catalytic properties.
Heterogeneous reactions occurred concurrently with
homogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 8C. At
such high temperatures, CPOM, steam/CO2 reforming, as
well as reverse water-gas shift, occurred in competition,
although the catalyst activity is still too low for the
reforming reactions to reach thermodynamic equilibrium.
Therefore, a second bed of metal catalyst is needed.
Summarizing, zirconia-based catalysts act as redox
catalysts due to defect chemistry. Their extremely low
redox capacity is responsible for low activity as well as
remarkable selectivity as compared to conventional redox
catalysts. Current research in our lab aims at a detailed
description
of
the
surface
oxygen
species
that
are
responsible for the activation of methane. At the same time
the sites for activation of O2 will be identified. A combined
study based on temperature programmed experiments,
transient experiments as well as isotopic exchange experi-
ments will allow us to decide on the role of adsorbed oxygen
species, lattice oxygen species as well as oxygen vacancies
in the catalytic cycle.
4. Oxygenation earth-alkalizeolite-Y
Recently, a new approach for selective oxidation of
alkanes (ethane, propane, isobutane and cyclohexane) on

cation exchanged Y zeolite was presented by Frei and co-
workers [3134], Grassian and co-workers [35], Vanoppen
et al. [36] and our group [37,38]. The proposed explanation
for the selective oxidation, either thermally or photo-
chemically activated, is the confinement of the reactants in a
restricted environment (super cage) that exhibits a strong
electrostatic field. Complete selectivity to oxygenates was
reported due to: (1) the diffusional constraints to avoid
radical coupling reactions and (2) strong adsorption of
partially oxidized products to avoid over-oxidation [35,38
40]. Activity was reported to increase in the order
NaY < BaY < SrY < CaY caused by the increasing cation
electrostatic field [36,37]. Note that the catalytic cycle has
not yet been closed because the oxygenates formed are left
adsorbed strongly in the zeolite.
To turn this type of selective oxidation into a practical
process, the barrier for product desorption has to be
overcome. Release of small oxygenated hydrocarbons from
zeolite Y is normally only achieved by extraction with polar
organic solvents [41]. A solvent free method would be
environmentally and economically preferable. Thus, the
critical problem is to achieve continuous desorption of
products from the zeolite. Use of a carrier gas at modestly
elevated temperature has been proposed to give polar
products chance to desorb at acceptable rates [40]. However,
desorption data are still absent for those reactions. More-
over, selectivity will face a challenge due to over-oxidation
of oxygenates by increasing temperature.
In our laboratory, in situ FTIR spectroscopy was used to
study the partial oxidation of propane to acetone by oxygen
on exchanged Y zeolites. Systematic variation of cation size,
Bro
nsted acidity, cation location and kinetic isotope effects
have been investigated in order to understand the real
mechanism of this reaction.
With changing type of cation, it was found at room
temperature and low propane and oxygen partial pressure,
that acetone and water are formed exclusively from the
reaction intermediate isopropylhydroperoxide (IHP). The
reaction
rate
decreased
in
the
order
CaY > S-
SrY > MgY > BaY. Surprisingly, MgY was less active
than CaY and SrY despite its smaller ionic radius. We
suggested that this is due to the higher hydrolysis level of

Mg2+ resulting Mg(OH)+ and Bro
nsted acid sites, thus
decreasing the concentration of bare Mg2+ ions. Studies on
Ca2+-exchanged zeolites with different exchange level
revealed that only super cage Ca2+ contribute significantly
to the selective oxidation of propane [38]. Bro
nsted acid
sites were also found to be important for propane partial
oxidation activity over HCaY zeolites. With increasing
number of protons in calcium exchanged Y zeolite, Volcano
plots were observed for: (1) amount of adsorbed propane; (2)
initial acetone formation rate; (3) total amount of acetone
produced after 20 h of reaction; and (4) acetone selectivity
(Fig. 4). Moreover, both IHP formation rate and decom-
position rate increased with increasing number of Bro
nsted
acid sites. Both observations mark the importance of
Bro
nsted acid sites for this reaction, in addition to (earth)
alkali cations.
A reaction mechanism with two different active sites is
proposed (Scheme 1): conversion of propane into IHP takes
place on cations, eventually assisted by the presence of
protons (steps 25), while IHP decomposition into acetone
occurs by Bro
nsted acid sites. Under specific experimental
conditions, in addition, 2-propanol can be formed through
cation activation of IHP to form radicals (steps 68).
Finally, TPD results (Fig. 5) on CaY zeolites point to two
acetone adsorption sites, which we assign to Bro
nsted acid
sites and Ca(OH)x species. Acetone mainly desorbs at higher
temperatures (>250 8C) under dry conditions, only a minor
amount is observed around 120 8C. Addition of water,
however, results in gas phase acetone already at room
temperature. Moreover, upon addition of water, both
desorption peaks are shifted to lower temperatures and
show increased intensities. It can be concluded that water
clearly facilitates acetone desorption either via shielding of
the electrostatic field or creation of additional sites.
The activity of alkaline earth cations in zeolite cages is a
prominent example of oxidation catalysis over non-redox
oxidic materials. To reach practical application of this type
of catalysts for partial oxidation of small alkanes, a balance
has to be found between cations, acid sites and the amount of
water in the zeolites or reactants. The results show that the
super cages in alkaline earth-modified zeolite Y can be
regarded as unique selective nano-reactors for oxygenation
of alkanes. The performance of such a nano-reactor is
determined by its detailed structure, including the properties
and location of alkaline earth cations, Bro
nsted acid sites as
well as lattice oxygen that comprise the wall of the nano-
reactor.

5. Conclusion
The work summarized here stresses that the use of
unconventional catalysts in selective oxidation reactions
indeed gives rise to remarkable selectivity, though the
mechanistic reasons may be very diverse.
The use of doped defective oxides gives rise to surface-
redox chemistry in the case of partial oxidation of methane
over yttrium-modified zirconia, where actual removal of
oxygen from the surface sites indeed takes place. Surpris-
ingly, this oxygen species is not able to activate hydrogen to
a significant extent. In contrast, Li-modified MgO catalyst
does not allow removal of oxygen; O sites generated by Li
are now able to abstract a H-radical from, e.g., propane.
Radical gas-phase chemistry of the propyl radicals is then
responsible for selective formation of olefins. The significant
fact in this case is that olefins are activated to a lesser extent
then alkanes.
The remarkable selectivity obtained in propane oxygena-
tion on earth-alkali-modified zeolite Y at unusually low
temperatures is due to the confinement of radicals in the
cages
of the
zeolite,
turning
radical
chemistry into
stoichiometric chemistry. The second significant effect is
the very effective stabilization of the resulting oxygenate,
acetone, in the cage. However, the stabilization thus also
implies extremely strong adsorption of the acetone, thus
preventing desorption of the product. Our work indicates
that desorption can be assisted by offering water as a
competitive adsorbing species, thus opening the possibility
to close the catalytic cycle.
