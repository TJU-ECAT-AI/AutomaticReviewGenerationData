The given literature does not contain any information about the historical use of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts or their unintentional doping effects. The text focuses on the intentional preparation of Li-doped MgO catalysts using a sol-gel method, and does not discuss the broader historical context of catalysis or unintentional doping. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided document.

However, we can extend the answer based on the general knowledge implied by the document:

The literature demonstrates that intentionally adding small amounts of lithium to magnesium oxide can significantly alter its catalytic properties. This suggests that even trace impurities in oxide catalysts could have had substantial effects on catalytic performance throughout the history of catalysis, even when researchers were unaware of their presence. 

The sophisticated analytical techniques and careful preparation methods described in the paper indicate that modern catalyst design involves a much more precise control and understanding of composition than was likely possible in earlier periods. This implies that many historical catalytic processes may have been influenced by unrecognized impurities or additives in ways that were not fully understood at the time.

The paper's focus on deliberately engineering defect sites and controlling surface properties through doping highlights how our current understanding of catalysis has evolved to intentionally manipulate these factors. This contrasts with earlier approaches that may have unknowingly benefited from or been hindered by similar effects caused by impurities.

Overall, while not directly addressed in the text, the document's content suggests that unintentional doping and impurities likely played a significant but often unrecognized role in historical catalytic processes. Modern catalyst design, as exemplified by the careful preparation and analysis methods described, represents a shift towards more deliberate and informed manipulation of catalyst composition and structure.

给定的文献中没有包含关于氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史使用或其无意掺杂效应的信息。该文本主要集中在使用溶胶-凝胶法有意制备Li掺杂MgO催化剂上，并没有讨论催化领域更广泛的历史背景或无意掺杂。因此，基于所提供的文档无法直接回答这个问题。

然而，我们可以根据文档暗示的一般知识来扩展答案：

该文献表明，在氧化镁中有意添加少量锂可以显著改变其催化性能。这表明，在整个催化历史中，氧化物催化剂中的微量杂质可能对催化性能产生了实质性影响，即使研究人员当时并不知道它们的存在。

文中描述的复杂分析技术和精心准备方法表明，现代催化剂设计涉及比早期可能更精确的成分控制和理解。这意味着许多历史上的催化过程可能受到了当时未被充分理解的未识别杂质或添加剂的影响。

论文着重于通过掺杂来有意设计缺陷位点和控制表面性能，突出了我们当前对催化作用的理解如何演变为有意操纵这些因素。这与早期可能无意中受益于或受阻于类似效应的方法形成对比。

总的来说，虽然文本中没有直接提及，但文档的内容表明，在历史催化过程中，无意掺杂和杂质可能扮演了重要但常常未被认识到的角色。现代催化剂设计，如文中描述的精心准备和分析方法所体现的那样，代表了向更有目的性和更明智地操纵催化剂成分和结构的转变。
