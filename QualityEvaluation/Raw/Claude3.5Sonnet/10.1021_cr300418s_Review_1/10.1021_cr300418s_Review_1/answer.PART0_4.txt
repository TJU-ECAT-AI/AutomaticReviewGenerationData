[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."

[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis in several ways. Low levels of impurities in oxide catalysts may act as substitutional dopants, potentially affecting catalytic activity when segregated at the surface, despite their low overall concentration. Industrial catalysts often contain small amounts of additives for various purposes, such as preventing coarsening, providing mechanical stability, preventing catalyst evaporation, increasing conversion and selectivity, or poisoning unwanted reactions. These factors suggest that doped oxide catalysis may have been occurring unknowingly for as long as oxide catalysis itself has been in use.

This historical perspective has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design. It highlights the importance of considering even trace impurities and additives in catalyst performance, as they may play a crucial role in catalytic activity. This realization emphasizes the need for more precise control and characterization of catalyst composition, including minor components. It also suggests that many historical catalytic processes may have benefited from unintentional doping effects, which could now be deliberately exploited and optimized in modern catalyst design. This understanding opens up new avenues for research and development in catalysis, focusing on intentional doping and precise control of catalyst composition to enhance performance and selectivity.

氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂在整个催化历史中以多种方式促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的无意使用。氧化物催化剂中的低水平杂质可能作为取代型掺杂剂，当在表面分离时可能影响催化活性，尽管它们的总体浓度很低。工业催化剂通常含有少量添加剂，用于各种目的，如防止粗化、提供机械稳定性、防止催化剂蒸发、提高转化率和选择性，或抑制不需要的反应。这些因素表明，掺杂氧化物催化作用可能在氧化物催化作用本身使用以来就一直在unknowingly发生。

这一历史视角对我们当前对催化过程的理解和现代催化剂设计的发展具有重要意义。它强调了考虑催化剂性能中甚至微量杂质和添加剂的重要性，因为它们可能在催化活性中起关键作用。这一认识强调了对催化剂成分（包括微量成分）进行更精确控制和表征的必要性。它还表明，许多历史上的催化过程可能受益于无意的掺杂效应，这些效应现在可以在现代催化剂设计中被故意利用和优化。这种理解为催化领域的研究和开发开辟了新的途径，专注于有意掺杂和精确控制催化剂成分以提高性能和选择性。
