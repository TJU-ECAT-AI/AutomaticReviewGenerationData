Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis in several ways. Low levels of impurities in oxide catalysts may act as substitutional dopants, potentially affecting catalytic activity when segregated at the surface, despite their low overall concentration. Industrial catalysts often contain small amounts of additives for various purposes, such as preventing coarsening, providing mechanical stability, preventing catalyst evaporation, increasing conversion and selectivity, or poisoning unwanted reactions. These additives may have inadvertently created doped oxide catalysts without the knowledge of researchers and industry professionals.

This historical perspective implies that the use of doped oxide catalysts may be as old as the use of oxide catalysts themselves, although this fact was not recognized until recently. This realization has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design. It suggests that many historical catalytic processes may have been influenced by unintentional doping, which could explain variations in catalytic performance that were previously not well understood. For modern catalyst design, this knowledge emphasizes the importance of considering and controlling even trace impurities and additives, as they may play a crucial role in catalytic activity. It also highlights the potential for intentional doping as a strategy for improving catalyst performance and tailoring catalytic properties for specific applications.

氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂在整个催化历史中以几种方式不经意地促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用。氧化物催化剂中的低水平杂质可能作为取代型掺杂剂，当它们在表面分离时，尽管总体浓度很低，但可能会影响催化活性。工业催化剂通常含有少量添加剂，用于各种目的，如防止粗化、提供机械稳定性、防止催化剂蒸发、增加转化率和选择性，或抑制不需要的反应。这些添加剂可能在研究人员和行业专业人士不知情的情况下无意中创造了掺杂氧化物催化剂。

这种历史观点暗示，掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用可能与氧化物催化剂的使用一样古老，尽管这一事实直到最近才被认识到。这一认识对我们当前对催化过程的理解和现代催化剂设计的发展有重要影响。它表明，许多历史上的催化过程可能受到了无意识掺杂的影响，这可能解释了先前不太理解的催化性能变化。对于现代催化剂设计，这一知识强调了考虑和控制甚至微量杂质和添加剂的重要性，因为它们可能在催化活性中起着关键作用。它还突出了有意掺杂作为改善催化剂性能和为特定应用定制催化性能的策略的潜力。
