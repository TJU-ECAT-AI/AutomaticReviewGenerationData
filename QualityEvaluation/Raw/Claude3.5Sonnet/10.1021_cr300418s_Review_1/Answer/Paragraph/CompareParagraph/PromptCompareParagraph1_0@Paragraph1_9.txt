The historical evolution and unintended application of doped oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysis have significantly shaped our understanding of catalytic processes. Throughout the history of catalysis, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have inadvertently contributed to the use of doped oxide catalysts, often without the awareness of researchers.

Oxide catalysts, such as magnesium oxide (MgO) and nickel oxide (NiO), have been extensively studied for various reactions, including PDH. However, the presence of impurities and additives has played a crucial role in their catalytic performance. For instance, lithium doping in MgO has been shown to dramatically increase its activity for methyl radical formation, which is relevant to PDH reactions [10.1021/ja00287a011]. This suggests that trace impurities or additives may have unintentionally altered catalyst behavior throughout catalysis history, potentially leading to misunderstandings about the nature of active sites or reaction mechanisms.

The impact of impurities on catalytic activity is exemplified by studies on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), where impurities like CaO, TiO2, and Na2O significantly influenced catalytic performance [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.013]. Surface segregation of additives, such as Y2O3 in YSZ, can occur independently of bulk composition, leading to consistent surface compositions that may differ from the intended bulk composition. This phenomenon highlights the importance of surface composition, as opposed to bulk composition, in determining catalytic activity.

In the context of PDH catalysts, the historical perspective suggests that many catalysts thought to be "pure" may have actually been unintentionally doped. For example, nickel oxide, a potential PDH catalyst, is known to be an electron defect semiconductor whose p-type character can be modified by incorporating suitable impurities [10.1021/ja01125a016]. This understanding of how impurities affect the electronic properties of oxides is crucial for modern catalyst design, allowing for intentional doping to optimize catalytic performance.

The realization that even trace amounts of impurities can significantly affect catalytic processes has led to a paradigm shift in catalyst design and characterization. Advanced techniques like X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) have become crucial in revealing the subtle but important effects of dopants and impurities on catalyst surfaces [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.013].

Moreover, the historical perspective emphasizes the complexity of catalyst systems and the importance of a holistic approach to catalyst design and characterization. It suggests that many historical catalytic processes may have benefited from unintentional doping effects, which could now be deliberately exploited and optimized in modern catalyst design for PDH reactions [10.1021/cr300418s\_1].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The historical perspective on the unintended application of doped oxide catalysts in PDH reactions provides valuable insights for future research and development in this field. Moving forward, researchers should focus on:

1. Developing more precise control and characterization methods for catalyst composition, including trace elements, to fully understand and exploit the effects of dopants on PDH catalyst performance.

2. Revisiting and reinterpreting earlier studies on oxide catalysts for PDH, potentially uncovering previously overlooked effects of unintentional doping on catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Exploring intentional doping strategies for PDH catalysts, leveraging the knowledge gained from studying the effects of impurities to enhance catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity.

4. Investigating the interplay between dopants and different oxide supports in PDH catalysts, aiming to develop synergistic effects that could lead to breakthrough performances.

5. Utilizing advanced in-situ and operando characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of doped oxide catalysts under PDH reaction conditions.

6. Developing computational models that can predict the effects of various dopants on oxide catalyst performance for PDH reactions, facilitating more efficient catalyst design processes.

7. Exploring novel doping strategies, such as co-doping or gradient doping, to create multifunctional PDH catalysts with enhanced performance and stability.

By addressing these aspects, future research can lead to the development of more efficient, selective, and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, contributing to the advancement of this important industrial process.

2 Historical Note
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
It is very likely that doped oxide catalysts have been used before the concept was formulated explicitly. Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low. Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of “additives” that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or “poison” an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity). It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact.
It is not our intention to provide an accurate or comprehensive history of the subject. Paravano (55-57) seems to be the first scientist who prepared substitutionally doped oxide intentionally, to boost the performance of an oxide catalyst. He studied the oxidation of CO by NiO with a variety of dopants. While at that time it was not possible to prove that doped oxides were prepared, at least the intention was to do so. The inspiration came from work that showed that doping changes the electronic properties of oxides (mainly the conductivity and the adsorption spectrum). The premise was that an additive that changed conductivity was likely to affect catalytic chemistry, especially for reactions in which electron transfer might be involved. Cimino et al. (58, 59) studied N2O decomposition on “solid-solutions” of NiO and MgO; by solid-solutions, they meant substitutional doping. They hoped that by “diluting” the Ni ions in the surface of NiO, they can modify the catalytic activity of Ni.
The idea of using substitutional doping of oxides in catalysis languished until around 1985 when Lunsford (60) showed that Li-doped MgO is a selective catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene. This was followed by a large number of studies (61-77) in which very stable oxides (e.g., MgO, CaO, La2O3, Sm2O3, etc.) were doped with low-valence dopants to perform oxidative coupling of methane. Several older reviews of this subject are available. (78-80) We will not review oxidative methane-coupling by oxides containing alkali dopants for two reasons. First, this reaction is performed at very high temperature (between 600 and 900 °C), and the structure of the doped-oxide catalyst is affected by this. (81) Therefore, this is not a good system for comparison to theory. Second, two excellent papers have reviewed the subject recently, (81, 82) and we have nothing to add to their analysis.
We are aware of only two articles that review catalytic chemistry of doped oxides (besides the ones mentioned in connection with oxidative methane coupling). One, by Cimino and Stone, (83) is mainly concerned with oxides more complex than the binary oxides studied here. The other, by Hegde, (84) concentrates on the considerable amount of work done in his group in Bangalore.
