It is very likely that doped oxide catalysts have been used before the concept was formulated explicitly. Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low. Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of “additives” that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or “poison” an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity). It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact.
It is not our intention to provide an accurate or comprehensive history of the subject. Paravano (55-57) seems to be the first scientist who prepared substitutionally doped oxide intentionally, to boost the performance of an oxide catalyst. He studied the oxidation of CO by NiO with a variety of dopants. While at that time it was not possible to prove that doped oxides were prepared, at least the intention was to do so. The inspiration came from work that showed that doping changes the electronic properties of oxides (mainly the conductivity and the adsorption spectrum). The premise was that an additive that changed conductivity was likely to affect catalytic chemistry, especially for reactions in which electron transfer might be involved. Cimino et al. (58, 59) studied N2O decomposition on “solid-solutions” of NiO and MgO; by solid-solutions, they meant substitutional doping. They hoped that by “diluting” the Ni ions in the surface of NiO, they can modify the catalytic activity of Ni.
The idea of using substitutional doping of oxides in catalysis languished until around 1985 when Lunsford (60) showed that Li-doped MgO is a selective catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene. This was followed by a large number of studies (61-77) in which very stable oxides (e.g., MgO, CaO, La2O3, Sm2O3, etc.) were doped with low-valence dopants to perform oxidative coupling of methane. Several older reviews of this subject are available. (78-80) We will not review oxidative methane-coupling by oxides containing alkali dopants for two reasons. First, this reaction is performed at very high temperature (between 600 and 900 °C), and the structure of the doped-oxide catalyst is affected by this. (81) Therefore, this is not a good system for comparison to theory. Second, two excellent papers have reviewed the subject recently, (81, 82) and we have nothing to add to their analysis.
We are aware of only two articles that review catalytic chemistry of doped oxides (besides the ones mentioned in connection with oxidative methane coupling). One, by Cimino and Stone, (83) is mainly concerned with oxides more complex than the binary oxides studied here. The other, by Hegde, (84) concentrates on the considerable amount of work done in his group in Bangalore.

The historical evolution and unintended application of doped oxide catalysts have significantly impacted our understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design. Throughout the history of catalysis, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have unknowingly contributed to the use of doped oxide catalysts, often leading to unexpected catalytic behaviors and performances.

One of the key aspects of this historical perspective is the realization that even trace amounts of impurities can profoundly influence catalytic activity. For instance, studies on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have shown that impurities such as CaO, TiO2, and Na2O can significantly affect catalytic performance [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.013]. This understanding has led to a reevaluation of historical catalytic data, as many catalysts thought to be "pure" may have actually been unintentionally doped.

The phenomenon of surface segregation has also played a crucial role in the unintended application of doped oxide catalysts. Research has shown that additives like Y2O3 in YSZ can segregate to the surface, leading to consistent surface compositions that differ from the bulk [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.013]. This surface enrichment can dramatically alter catalytic properties, even when the overall impurity concentration is low.

The case of lithium-doped MgO provides an excellent example of how intentional doping can significantly enhance catalytic activity. Lithium doping was found to increase the activity of MgO for methyl radical formation by creating additional active sites, namely O- ions produced at substitutional lithium ion impurities [10.1021/j100267a002]. This discovery suggests that throughout catalysis history, trace impurities may have unintentionally altered catalyst behavior, leading to misunderstandings about the nature of active sites or reaction mechanisms.

The complexity of impurity distribution in oxide catalysts has also been recognized. Studies on nickel oxide have shown that overall impurity content does not necessarily mean homogeneous distribution throughout the lattice [10.1021/ja01125a016]. This understanding is crucial for interpreting historical catalytic data and developing more precise methods of catalyst preparation and characterization.

The historical perspective on doped oxide catalysts has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design. It emphasizes the importance of carefully controlling and characterizing catalyst composition, including trace elements. This realization has led to the development of more advanced characterization techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), which are crucial in revealing the subtle but important effects of dopants and impurities on catalyst surfaces [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.013].

Furthermore, this historical insight has opened up new avenues for intentional doping in catalyst design. Researchers can now deliberately modify oxide catalysts to enhance their performance, tailoring catalysts to specific reactions and conditions [10.1021/ja01102a051]. This approach has the potential to lead to more efficient and effective catalytic processes.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The historical perspective on the unintended application of doped oxide catalysts provides a foundation for future advancements in catalysis research and design. Moving forward, several key areas of focus emerge:

1. Advanced characterization techniques: The development of even more sensitive and precise analytical methods will be crucial in understanding the role of trace impurities and their distribution in catalyst materials.

2. Controlled doping strategies: Building on the historical insights, researchers can develop more sophisticated approaches to intentional doping, potentially creating catalysts with unprecedented activity and selectivity.

3. Computational modeling: Advances in computational chemistry and materials science could enable more accurate predictions of how impurities and dopants affect catalytic properties, guiding experimental design.

4. Revisiting historical catalysts: There is potential for rediscovering and optimizing overlooked catalytic systems by reexamining historical data with our current understanding of doping effects.

5. Nanoscale engineering: The ability to control catalyst composition and structure at the nanoscale could lead to highly efficient catalysts with precisely tuned properties.

6. In situ and operando studies: Developing techniques to study catalysts under reaction conditions could provide deeper insights into how dopants and impurities influence catalytic processes in real-time.

7. Sustainable catalyst design: Incorporating the knowledge of doping effects could lead to the development of more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient catalysts.

These future directions highlight the potential for significant advancements in catalyst design and optimization, building upon the historical insights gained from the unintended application of doped oxide catalysts.
