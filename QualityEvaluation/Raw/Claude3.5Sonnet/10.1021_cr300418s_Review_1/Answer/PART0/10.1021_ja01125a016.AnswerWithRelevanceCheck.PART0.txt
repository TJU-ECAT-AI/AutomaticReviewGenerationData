          [1] "Theoretical advances and successful applications of the band theory of the solid state have recently led to a better understanding of the electronic properties of metallic oxides. In the field of catalysis the production of oxide semi-conductors with controlled electronic characteristics by Verwey and his school' discloses new possibilities, and affords a sound basis for attacking the problem of the relation between electronic states of oxides and their activity to catalyze chemical reactions."

          [2] "As a preliminary study in this field, the reduction process of nickel oxide by hydrogen was investigated in order to obtain information on the effect of ionic and electronic defects in the solid phase on its reductive properties."

          [3] "The present data refer mainly to this latter stage of the reductive process and clearly show how the reaction can be greatly affected by the defective structure of the solid phase."

          [4] "It must be pointed out that the above concentrations of impurities in nickel oxide refer to over-all values of impurity content. It does not imply that all the impurity is homogeneously distributed in the nickel oxide lattice."

          [5] "Nickel oxide is known to be an electron defect semiconductor, containing in its lattice cationic holes (O(Ni+3)) and an electrically equivalent number of electron holes (O(e-)). Its p-type character can be modified and controlled to a certain extent by incorporation in the lattice of suitable impurities."

          Throughout the history of catalysis, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have likely contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. This historical perspective has several implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design:

          1. The presence of impurities and defects in oxide catalysts has been influencing catalytic processes, even when researchers were unaware of their presence or impact. The study on nickel oxide reduction by hydrogen demonstrates that ionic and electronic defects in the solid phase significantly affect the reaction process.

          2. Recent advances in understanding the electronic properties of metallic oxides, particularly through band theory, have opened up new possibilities in catalysis research. This improved understanding has revealed that many oxide catalysts used historically were likely unintentionally doped.

          3. The complexity of impurity distribution in oxide catalysts has been recognized. Overall impurity content does not necessarily mean homogeneous distribution throughout the lattice, which is important for interpreting historical catalytic data and developing more precise methods of catalyst preparation and characterization.

          4. The p-type character of semiconductors like nickel oxide can be modified by incorporating suitable impurities into the lattice. This understanding of how impurities affect the electronic properties of oxides is crucial for modern catalyst design, allowing for intentional doping to optimize catalytic performance.

          5. These insights have led to a more systematic approach to catalyst design, taking into account electronic properties and intentional doping. There is now an improved ability to control and optimize catalytic properties through careful manipulation of oxide composition and structure.

          6. The historical perspective emphasizes the importance of carefully controlling and characterizing catalyst composition in modern catalyst design, as even trace impurities can significantly affect catalytic properties.

          7. There is potential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts based on a deeper understanding of the role of defects and electronic structure in catalytic processes.

          In summary, this historical context underscores the importance of precise characterization techniques and controlled synthesis methods in modern catalyst design. It also highlights the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how impurities and defects influence electronic properties and, consequently, catalytic activity at the atomic and molecular levels.

          在催化历史中，氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂可能导致了无意中使用掺杂氧化物催化剂。这一历史视角对我们当前对催化过程的理解和现代催化剂设计的发展有几个重要影响：

          1. 氧化物催化剂中杂质和缺陷的存在一直在影响催化过程，即使研究人员当时并不知道它们的存在或影响。对氢气还原氧化镍的研究表明，固相中的离子和电子缺陷显著影响反应过程。

          2. 近期在理解金属氧化物电子性质方面的进展，特别是通过能带理论，为催化研究开辟了新的可能性。这种改进的理解揭示了历史上使用的许多氧化物催化剂可能是无意中被掺杂的。

          3. 氧化物催化剂中杂质分布的复杂性已被认识到。总体杂质含量并不一定意味着在晶格中均匀分布，这对解释历史催化数据和开发更精确的催化剂制备和表征方法很重要。

          4. 像氧化镍这样的半导体的p型特性可以通过在晶格中掺入适当的杂质来改变。这种对杂质如何影响氧化物电子性质的理解对现代催化剂设计至关重要，允许通过有意掺杂来优化催化性能。

          5. 这些见解导致了更系统的催化剂设计方法，考虑到电子性质和有意掺杂。现在可以通过仔细操纵氧化物成分和结构，更好地控制和优化催化性能。

          6. 这一历史视角强调了在现代催化剂设计中仔细控制和表征催化剂成分的重要性，因为即使是微量杂质也可能显著影响催化性能。

          7. 基于对缺陷和电子结构在催化过程中作用的深入理解，有潜力开发更高效和选择性的催化剂。

          总之，这一历史背景强调了精确表征技术和可控合成方法在现代催化剂设计中的重要性。它也突出了需要更全面地理解杂质和缺陷如何在原子和分子水平上影响电子性质，从而影响催化活性。
