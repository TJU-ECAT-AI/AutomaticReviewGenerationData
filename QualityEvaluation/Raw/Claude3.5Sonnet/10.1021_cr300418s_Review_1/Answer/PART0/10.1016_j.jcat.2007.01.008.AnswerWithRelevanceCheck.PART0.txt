          [1] "Li-promoted MgO is discussed as a nonredox catalyst for hydrocarbon conversion reactions [1722]."

          [2] "The catalytic activity of the solid exhibits a strong correlation to the amount of removable oxygen that is apparently destabilized by Li+ ions [21,23]."

          [3] "Along with the generation of [Li+O] centers, an alternative mechanism that involves surface F-centers as active sites has been put forward [24,25]."

          [4] "Doping polycrystalline materials with impurities—which has a profound effect on the surface reactivity of the host oxide but do not alter the bulk structure—can represent an approach to quantifying the number of reactive sites on pure MgO particles."

          [5] "Pure alkaline earth oxides (AEOs) have been intensively investigated in the fields of surface science and catalysis [211] due to their simple crystal structure and perfect ionicity."

          [6] "Furthermore, the MgO surface can be effectively doped with selected impurities by making use of thermally induced impurity segregation into the surface [12,13]."

          [7] "As demonstrated for mixed CaxMg1xO particles, this can lead to unexpected optical and chemical surface properties [14,15]."

          The literature suggests that impurities and additives have played a significant role in oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis, often unintentionally. Examples such as Li-doped MgO demonstrate how even small amounts of impurities can profoundly change surface reactivity and catalytic properties without altering the bulk structure. This historical perspective implies that:

          1. Many historical catalysts likely contained unintentional impurities that affected their performance, potentially leading to misunderstandings about active sites and reaction mechanisms.
          
          2. The role of trace impurities in catalytic processes may have been underestimated or misunderstood in the past.
          
          3. Many studies on "pure" oxide catalysts may have actually been examining doped systems without realizing it.

          For our current understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design, this insight highlights:

          1. The importance of carefully controlling and characterizing catalyst composition, including trace elements.
          
          2. The potential of intentional doping as a powerful tool for tuning catalyst properties and developing more efficient catalysts.
          
          3. The need for ultra-pure materials and precise characterization techniques in catalyst development.
          
          4. The opportunity to re-examine historical catalytic data in light of potential unintentional doping effects, which could yield new insights or lead to the rediscovery and optimization of overlooked catalytic systems.

          Overall, this historical perspective emphasizes the complex relationship between catalyst composition and performance, and the importance of considering even minor impurities in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes.

          文献表明，杂质和添加剂在催化历史中一直在氧化物催化剂中发挥重要作用，通常是无意的。像Li掺杂MgO这样的例子展示了即使是少量的杂质也能在不改变体相结构的情况下深刻改变表面反应性和催化性能。这一历史视角意味着：

          1. 许多历史催化剂可能含有无意的杂质，影响了它们的性能，可能导致对活性位点和反应机理的误解。
          
          2. 过去可能低估或误解了微量杂质在催化过程中的作用。
          
          3. 许多关于"纯"氧化物催化剂的研究可能实际上是在不知不觉中研究掺杂系统。

          对于我们当前对催化过程的理解和现代催化剂设计，这一洞察强调：

          1. 仔细控制和表征催化剂组成（包括微量元素）的重要性。
          
          2. 有意掺杂作为调节催化剂性能和开发更高效催化剂的强大工具的潜力。
          
          3. 在催化剂开发中需要超纯材料和精确的表征技术。
          
          4. 有机会根据潜在的无意掺杂效应重新审视历史催化数据，这可能产生新的见解或导致被忽视的催化系统的重新发现和优化。

          总的来说，这一历史视角强调了催化剂组成和性能之间的复杂关系，以及在理解和优化催化过程中考虑微量杂质的重要性。
