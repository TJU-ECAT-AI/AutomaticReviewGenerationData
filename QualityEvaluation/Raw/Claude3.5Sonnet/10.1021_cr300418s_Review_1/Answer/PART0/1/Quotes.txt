[1] "Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on the catalytic performance"

          [2] "As long as YSZ catalyst was not contaminated, the composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ was independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and calcination temperature; the surface always contained 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."

          [3] "The same sintering treatment caused the activity of YSZ containing trace of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse. The effect is due to segregation of the impurities to the surface, which either blocks active surface of YSZ catalyst or forms new phases with different catalytic properties."

[1] "The lithium-doped sample was prepared by adding the carbonate to the MgO slurry."

          [2] "Lithium-doped MgO, on the other hand, was by far the most active catalyst for the production of gas-phase allyl radicals from propylene."

          [3] "Previously, it was proposed that the sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on MgO were O- ions associated with intrinsic surface cation vacancies in the MgO lattice, and the concentration of these sites would be expected to be low. The active sites for hydrogen atom abstraction on Li/MgO were also proposed to be surface O- ions; however, in addition to vacancy-O- sites, O- ions were also produced at substitutional lithium ion impurities."

[1] "Lithium doping was found to have a beneficial effect in both MgO samples. Activity increased by a factor of 2.6 and 3.5 for the MgO(F) and MgO(B) samples, respectively."

          [2] "Sodium doping was found to have virtually no effect on the initial activity. Doping with iron was also examined and this resulted in no activity increase."

          [3] "We propose that methyl radicals are formed at O- ions on the surface of pure and lithium-doped MgO."

          [4] "Over pure MgO, O- ions associated with intrinsic cation vacancies are responsible for methyl radical formation. In addition to these sites, [Li+O-] centers are formed on the lithium-doped samples, and these are responsible for the increased activity in the doped samples."

          [5] "The fact that sodium was less effective in generating active sites than lithium also suggests the importance of a substitutional defect site. The ionic radius of Mg2+ is 0.66 Å, and that of Li' is 0.68 Å, whereas the radius of Nat is 0.97 A."

          [6] "A sample of 7.0 wt % Li/silica (Davison Grade 57) sample was prepared by impregnating silica gel with Li2C03. Although the activity of this material increased by a factor of 18 from pure silica gel, it was a factor of 12 less than a 7.0 wt % Li/MgO(B) sample and only 33% of the activity exhibited by the pure MgO(B) sample."

[1] "Li-promoted MgO is discussed as a nonredox catalyst for hydrocarbon conversion reactions [1722]."

          [2] "The catalytic activity of the solid exhibits a strong correlation to the amount of removable oxygen that is apparently destabilized by Li+ ions [21,23]."

          [3] "Along with the generation of [Li+O] centers, an alternative mechanism that involves surface F-centers as active sites has been put forward [24,25]."

          [4] "Doping polycrystalline materials with impurities—which has a profound effect on the surface reactivity of the host oxide but do not alter the bulk structure—can represent an approach to quantifying the number of reactive sites on pure MgO particles."

          [5] "Pure alkaline earth oxides (AEOs) have been intensively investigated in the fields of surface science and catalysis [211] due to their simple crystal structure and perfect ionicity."

          [6] "Furthermore, the MgO surface can be effectively doped with selected impurities by making use of thermally induced impurity segregation into the surface [12,13]."

          [7] "As demonstrated for mixed CaxMg1xO particles, this can lead to unexpected optical and chemical surface properties [14,15]."

[1] "Theoretical advances and successful applications of the band theory of the solid state have recently led to a better understanding of the electronic properties of metallic oxides. In the field of catalysis the production of oxide semi-conductors with controlled electronic characteristics by Verwey and his school' discloses new possibilities, and affords a sound basis for attacking the problem of the relation between electronic states of oxides and their activity to catalyze chemical reactions."

          [2] "As a preliminary study in this field, the reduction process of nickel oxide by hydrogen was investigated in order to obtain information on the effect of ionic and electronic defects in the solid phase on its reductive properties."

          [3] "The present data refer mainly to this latter stage of the reductive process and clearly show how the reaction can be greatly affected by the defective structure of the solid phase."

          [4] "It must be pointed out that the above concentrations of impurities in nickel oxide refer to over-all values of impurity content. It does not imply that all the impurity is homogeneously distributed in the nickel oxide lattice."

          [5] "Nickel oxide is known to be an electron defect semiconductor, containing in its lattice cationic holes (O(Ni+3)) and an electrically equivalent number of electron holes (O(e-)). Its p-type character can be modified and controlled to a certain extent by incorporation in the lattice of suitable impurities."

[1] "Present knowledge on the typical behavior of electron transfer processes involved in chemical reactions catalyzed by oxide semiconductors have been mainly obtained through the pioneering studies of Wagner and Hauffe and Garner and associates"

          [2] "Thus it became apparent that the defective structure of the catalytic surface, which controls its semi-conductivity, would affect the chemical reaction occurring on it."

          [3] "The present communication refers to the oxidation of carbon monoxide on nickel oxide samples, whose electronic characteristics have been modified following the method of controlled valency semi-conductors, recently developed by Yerwey and associates."

          [4] "The addition of foreign ions into the nickel oxide lattice might modify the concentration and distribution of holes and electrons by suitable changes of the Fermi level of the semi-conductor."

[1] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk ; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[2] "The process which we have observed on pure MgO is too rapid to be identified with this sort of electron transfer ; furthermore, the impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

[3] "The impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

[4] "We conclude that the catalyst does not function well in this reaction simply because of its high concentration of positive holes, but because other parameters contribute to the characteristics of the adsorbed complexes."

[5] "The difficulty of comparison with NiO is acute when we come to discuss the catalytic activities. Oxygen poisoning of NiO is so prevalent that little or no agreement exists about the specific activity or activation energy for N20 decomposition on NiO."

[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."

          [2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."

          [3] "It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact."

[1] "Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) revealed the influence of calcination temperature (5001100 8C) on the enrichment of the YSZ surface with Y2O3 and impurities such as CaO, TiO2, Na2O, which have profound influence on the catalytic performance"
