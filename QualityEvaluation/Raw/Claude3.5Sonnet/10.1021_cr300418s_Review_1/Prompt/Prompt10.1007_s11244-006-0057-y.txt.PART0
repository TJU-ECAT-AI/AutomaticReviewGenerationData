Efficient catalysts for olefins from alkanes: solgel synthesis of high
surface area nano scale mixed oxide clusters

High surface area nano scale Li/MgO oxide clusters with low lithium loadings are prepared by solgel method. Appreciable
amounts of lithium present can be incorporated into the magnesia gel during preparation and retained in the oxide matrix after gel
combustion. This limits presence of free lithium phases and helps prevent the associated sintering and loss of surface area during
thermal treatments. The solgel method also allows to circumvent the high temperature treatments necessary to incorporate lithium
into the magnesia oxide matrix, a prerequisite for the formation of [Li+O)] type defect sites which are the catalytically active sites
for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.
KEY WORDS: nanoscale oxide clusters; Li/MgO; catalysts; high surface area; oxygen vacancy; IR CO.
1. Introduction
Currently there is considerable demand for lower
olefins which are building blocks for chemical industry
[1,2]. Steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation are
the major routes for production of ethene, propene at
the moment [3]. Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of
alkanes, i.e., coupling dehydrogenation (directly or
indirectly) with hydrogen-oxidation using oxygen, is
conceptually a promising alternative route for the pro-
duction of olefins because (a) the reaction is exothermic
and therefore the energy required can be generated
internally (b) overcomes problems related to equilibrium
limitation, coking, and catalyst deactivation during
dehydrogenation.
However, there is no commercial scale process at the
moment, development of efficient catalysts being the
bottleneck [4]. Typically, olefins yields in the range
of <30% are reported for various redox-type oxide
catalysts (mostly V2O5 based) studied [5], the main
problem being the re-adsorption of olefins leading to
total oxidation. In this context, a new catalyst formu-
lation which is non-redox-type, i.e. Li/MgO, is shown to
be efficient for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4
alkanes [68] resulting in olefin yields in the range of
50% [9]. A comparison of the performance of the Li/
MgO catalyst with that of a typical redox catalyst V2O5/
MgO is shown in figure 1. It can be seen that sequential
olefin combustion is not a problem with the Li/MgO
catalyst, the high selectivity to olefins is maintained even
at high conversions [10,11].
In the case of Li/MgO, defect sites play a key role and
[Li+O)] type defect site is considered to be responsible
for the catalytic activity by initiating hydrogen from
alkane and allowing radical reactions in gas phase to
yield olefins [1214]. The substitution of a Mg2
+ ion by a
Li+ ion in the MgO matrix, creates an oxygen vacancy
(positive hole formation) (scheme 1). [Li+O)] center is
then produced by a hole being trapped at the O2) sites
which are adjacent to Li+ sites (scheme 2) [1517].
Oxygen vacancies created by incorporation of Li in
MgO result in low coordinated (LC), Mg2+
LC sites
which can be detected by IR spectroscopy using probe
molecules such as CO [18]. Creation of [Li+O)] sites is
energetically demanding and requires high temperature
(>
850 C) treatments [13]. Li/MgO catalysts thus pos-
sess generally low surface areas that result in low con-
centration of surface defect active sites and hence low
catalytic activity [19]. To improve efficiency of the cat-
alyst, enhancing the surface defect site concentration is
essential. In this communication, this is attempted by
preparing high surface area nano-scale oxide clusters
using solgel synthesis method in order to attempt (i)
incorporation of Li into MgO lattice under mild con-
ditions and (ii) maximize the chance for the formation of
[Li+O)] defect sites at lower temperatures. These cata-
lysts will be used later for oxidative cracking at relatively
low temperatures (500600 C) as compared to e.g.
oxidative coupling (750800 C).

Commercially available Mg(OCH3)2 solution (Aldrich,
8.7 wt%, in methanol), methanol (Merck, GR for
analysis) and LiNO3 (Merck) were used. Water used was

obtain 0, 1, 3 and 5 wt% Li in MgO) was mixed with
water solution in methanol (0.8 M) at room temperature
and allowed to stand for 24 h for gelation (wet gels).
After drying at 50 C in vacuum for 7 h the dried gels
were heated at 500 C in air for 1 h.
2.2. Materials characterization
The thermal analyses (TGA, DSC) of the gels were
carried out on a Setaram TGA-DSC 111, using heating
rate 5 C/min in air. Gases that evolved during these
measurements were analysed by mass spectrometry
(QMS-Omnistar).
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Philips
PW1830 using CuKa radiation, k = 0.1544 nm. Spectra
were measured in reflection geometry in the 2h range
between 20 and 50. The compositions of the samples
were
determined
by
chemical
analysis
(AAS).
N2
adsorption measurements were carried out using a
Micrometrics Tristar instrument. Prior the analysis the
samples were out-gassed in vacuum at 200 C for 24 h.
FTIR experiments were conducted using a Fou-
rier transform spectrometer, Nicolet 20 XSB. The dried
gel / oxide, as fine powders, were mixed with KBr and
pressed into a disk. The disk was placed in a cell and
heated up to 100 C and purged with air before
recording spectra at the required temperatures.
Infrared spectra of adsorbed CO molecules were
recorded on self-supported wafers of the catalysts
(0.010.02 mg of powder). Wafers were placed in an IR
transmission cell. The cell was evacuated to 10)8 bar and
heating the system up to 350 C (1 h, rate 2.5 C/min).
Next the system was cooled down with liquid nitrogen
to )193 C and switched to pure CO at a starting
pressure of 2*10)1 mbar. After 30 min at this pressure,
the system was re-evacuated and IR spectra were
recorded (PerkinElmer 2000 FTIR with a data point
resolution of 4 cm)1). Experiments were carried out
over three different samples respectively MgO and
15 wt% Li/MgO (solgel method, calcinations at
500 C) and typical spectral pattern was recorded in the
22002110 cm)1 range.

3.1. Gel studies
Figure 2a shows the TGA in air of gel obtained from
hydrolysis of Mg (OCH3)2. The small weight loss of 3%
observed below 100 C is associated to residual metha-
nol and water still present in the dried gel. The experi-
mental
weight
loss
of
34%
between
300350 C
corresponds to transformation of the magnesia gel.

Figure 2b shows the analysis of gases evolved during the
above TGA experiment as followed by mass spectrom-
etry. A significant signal for COx in the temperature
range (corresponding to the weight loss in TGA) indi-
cated combustion of organic species in gel. Figure 2c
shows the DSC signal in air recorded during the gel
decomposition.
Two
exothermic
transitions
were
observed in the temperature ranges, 200250 C and
300350 C. For the first peak, there was no corre-
sponding weight loss in TGA (see figure 2a) and should
represent an isomorphic transformation. The second
exothermic peak at 350 C corresponded to the com-
bustion of the alkoxide gel.
Figure 3 shows infrared spectra of gels treated at
different temperature. Figure 3a corresponds to that of
the Mg-gel at 100 C. In this case, peaks characteristic
for
OH
stretching
(36003700 cm)1)
and
CH3
stretching
(27002900 cm)1,
methoxy

were
detected. As expected from the TGA/DSC data above,
the methoxy groups were not observed in FTIR spec-
trum at 500 C (figure 3b) as they would be decomposed
at this temperature. In the case of 5 wt% Li/Mg gel
(Fig. 3c), the intensity of methoxy groups is much lower
even at 100 C and indicates that the composition of the
gel is changed at this higher Li concentration.
Figure 4 and 5 show the details of thermal analyses of
the Li containing magnesia gels. The TGA profile for gel
with 1 wt% Lithium was similar to that obtained for
pure magnesia gel; the weight loss was 33% (figure 4a)
and occurred in a single step between 300350 C. In the
case of 5 wt% Li/Mg gel (figure 5a) two regions of
weight losses were recorded: the first weight loss (27%)
was around 300 C and the second (24%) at 650 C.
Figures 4b and 5b show analyses of the gases evolved
during the TG experiments. The COx signal corre-
sponding to the gel combustion was observed in both
the cases (300350 C). Additionally two NOx peaks,
i.e., around 350 and 650 C (originating from decom-
position of nitrate species present in gel) were also
observed. The starting precursors for gel formation were
Mg(OCH3)2 and LiNO3. The NOx peak at 350 C is
typical for Mg(NO3)2 decomposition [20]. Thus, any
magnesium nitrate present, should be formed during
gelation. Decomposition LiNO3 occurs around 650 C
[20] and hence the second NOx peak observed should
come from decomposition of unreacted LiNO3 present
in gel. For the 5 wt% Li/Mg gel, the intensity of the
NOx peak at 650 C was at least five times larger. The
corresponding weight loss (24 %) in TGA (figure 5a,
650 C) indicated that 70% of Li was present as free
LiNO3 in the gel. In the case of 1 wt% Li/Mg gel a small
weight loss (
<3%) in TGA (figure 4a, 650 C) shows
that less than 30% of Li is present as free LiNO3.
DSC measurements carried with the gel showed that
for 1 wt% Li containing sample one exothermic peak
(320 C) corresponding to gel combustion was recorded

(figure 4c). In contrast, for the 5 wt% Li/Mg gel two
endothermic peaks were seen between 250 and 320 C
and at 630 C (figure 5c). The DSC signal between 250
and 320 C is typical for bulk Mg(NO3)2 decomposition
under the same conditions. These two endothermic
transitions correspond to decomposition of Mg and Li
nitrates, respectively as we mentioned above. In both
samples, the isomorphic transition observed for pure
magnesia gel T < 250 C, was absent indicating possible
differences in gel structures/transitions compared to
pure magnesia gel. In the case of the 5 wt% Li/MgO
sample the exothermic peak corresponding to alkoxide
decomposition was not observed. This may be due to the
fact that (i) Mg(NO3)2 decomposition occurs in the same
temperature range and (ii) the alkoxide content in the
gel was low (as shown by infrared spectrum in figure 3c).
3.2. Oxide materials characterization
Table 1 shows the BET surface areas of oxide pow-
ders obtained after calcination of gels at 500 C. Two
important conclusions could be drawn (i) high surface
area materials were obtained by the solgel method used
and (ii) even in the presence of smaller amounts of Li the
high surface area (190 m2/g) could be maintained. At
higher lithium concentration (5 wt%) the resulting sur-
face area was less spectacular. The surface areas of the
Li containing materials were even stable at higher
temperatures for the samples made by the solgel
method (see table 2).
Figure 6 shows the nitrogen adsorption isotherms for
samples calcined at 500 C. In the case of MgO and
1 wt% Li/MgO, the hysteresis loops are typical for
agglomerates of spherical particles, Type H1 [21]. The
surface areas of the samples were also high, as men-
tioned earlier. For the 5 wt% Li sample, hysteresis was
typical for pore structure made by aggregates of plate-
lets, Type H3 [21]. This sample showed an appreciable
loss in surface area as described earlier.
XRD pattern of the oxide samples are shown in fig-
ure 7. The peaks corresponding to MgO phase became
narrower for samples with higher lithium loading. From
the X-ray Line Broadening Analysis (XLBA) we esti-
mated particle size of 5 nm in the case of MgO and it
increased up to 10 nm for 5 wt% Li sample. In the case
of samples containing higher amount of lithium, peaks
of Li2CO3 could also be observed (in 1 wt% Li/MgO
separate phase of Li2CO3 was hardly detected). No
other phases of Li, including LiNO3, were detected by
XRD.
Semi-quantitative experiments were carried out using
X-ray powder diffraction in order to estimate the
amount of lithium present as a separate phase (Li2CO3)
and to get an idea of the amount of lithium incorporated
into the lattice of MgO (solid solution). The relative
intensity of the strongest line [002] in Li2CO3 and [200]
for MgO is plotted for a series of Li2CO3/MgO
mechanical mixtures prepared (line A)1 and showed in
figure 8. Line B corresponds to the same relative inten-
sity for the oxides prepared via the solgel route. The
difference between the line A and B should correspond

to lithium that is incorporated into MgO lattice and
therefore, not present as Li2CO3. The results show that
lithium ions can be incorporated in the MgO lattice
(40% for 1 wt% Li and 16% for 5 wt% Li in MgO)
forming a solid solution under mild conditions i.e., by
cogelling Mg(OCH3)2 and LiNO3, and calcination at
500 C. The amount of Li present as a separate phase in
the samples are in excellent agreement with the free
LiNO3 present in the corresponding gels as estimated
from TG analysis (figures 4a and 5a).
3.3. Oxide materialssurface characterization
Figure 9 shows the results of CO adsorption on the
samples. Carbon monoxide is widely used as probe
molecule in IR spectroscopic characterization of Lewis
sites (Mg2+ in the case of MgO). CO coordinates to
these sites exclusively via the C-end lone pair. The
surface of MgO, in the absence of point or extended
defects, is rather unreactive towards CO. Indeed it binds
much more strongly and exhibits red shifts in the CO
stretching frequency when adsorbed on the low coordi-
nated cations of the surface (steps, edges and corners)
where the electric field is large [22].

High surface area MgO (250 m2/g) shows a simple
spectral
pattern
dominated
by
a
broad
peak
at
2155 cm)1 although weak shoulders at both sides are
present as well. In the case of 1 wt% Li/MgO the
spectrum after CO adsorption shows three
peaks
respectively at 2164, 2155 and 2148 cm)1. The following
bands were detected in the spectrum of CO adsorbed
over 5 wt% Li/MgO: (i) a weak peak at 2200 cm)1,
(ii) broad bands at 2164 cm)1 and 2152 cm)1 and
(iii) bands at 2184 and 2148 cm)1.
3.4. Catalytic performance of Li/MgO catalysts
Table 3 shows the catalytic performance of 1 wt%
Li/MgO catalyst at 600 and 650 C. It is interesting to
note that the catalysts give high olefin (ethene + pro-
pene) selectivities [10]. Presence of ethene also suggests
that some cracking (CC bond rupture) occurs. At the
higher temperature, propane conversion increases as
expected, however, selectivity to olefins remains high. At
the higher temperature more methane is formed and
selectivity to COx slightly decreases. Unlike redox based
catalysts (figure 1) selectivity to olefins does not decrease
with increasing propane conversion (figure 10). This is
one of the major advantages of these catalysts over
redox type catalysts. Detailed studies with Li/MgO
catalysts are in progress.
4. Discussion
During the solgel process mainly two reactions take
place i.e., hydrolysis and condensation [23]. In the case
of magnesium methoxide these reactions can be written
as following:
MgOCH32  xH2O
! MgOHxOCH32x  xCH3OH i
Mg  OCH3  OH  Mg
! Mg  O  Mg  CH3OH
ii
Mg  OH  OH  Mg
! Mg  O  Mg  H2O
iii
Gel formation can be attributed to presence of (i) chains
of MgOMg bonds (chemical gel) and their inter-
nal
interaction
and/or
(ii)
smaller
molecules
of
Mg(OH)(OCH3) which interact with each other by
hydrogen
bonding
and/or
electrostatic
interactions
(physical gel) as described in literature [24]. Our thermal
analysis results and IR spectral studies confirm these.
When Li is present the extent of hydrolysis/condensa-
tion is altered quite drastically. This can be concluded
from (i) lower intensity of CH3 stretching in the IR
spectra (figure 3c as compared to figure 3a) (ii) lower
weight loss for 5 wt% Li/Mg gel (24%) vs. Mg gel
(34%) and (iii) lower amounts of COx formed during
combustion (figure 2b vs. 4b and 5b). These observa-
tions suggest also that Li enhances the hydrolysis rate.
Thus in the presence of Li, composition of the gel is
changed.
In the case of 5 wt% Li sample about 70% of Li
added was shown to be present as free LiNO3 molecules
(TG results). Semi-quantitative XRD results (figure 8)
indicate that 16% of Li is incorporated (no present as
free phase). The value is lower compared to TG results
(30%) however both results indicate that part of Li is
built in MgO. No other free Li phases were observed
(XRD,
figure 7).

shown) and thermal analysis characteristics of 5 wt%
Li/Mg gel was different from that of the others. It is thus
possible that lithium is incorporated already during
magnesia gel formation and is the cause for the differ-
ence.
Preparation of Li/MgO catalysts by conventional
methods (impregnation of bulk MgO with Li salts fol-
lowed by calcination) leads to the formation of mixture
of phases of Li2CO3 and MgO [25]. This is because Li2O
formed on calcinations easily sorbs CO2 from atmo-
sphere and forms Li2CO3. Only a high temperature
treatment (750 C) allows the incorporation of lithium,
when Li2CO3 melts and free Li+ ions can move and
diffuse into the MgO lattice replacing Mg2+ ions [13].
The disadvantage of this is that this mobility of the Li
species facilitates sintering of MgO (alkali salts are
known to facilitate sintering [8]) and subsequent loss of
surface area (Table 2). Thus, solgel method applied to
Li/MgO materials synthesis achieves two objectives
simultaneously, (i) allows incorporation of Li in the
magnesia under milder conditions during gelation and
(ii) prevents the enhancement of sintering during ther-
mal treatments by minimizing the amount of free Li
phases present. In addition, incorporation of lithium
already at the gel stage, e.g., OMgOLi, facilitates
formation
of
a
substitutional
solid
solution
LixMg1)xO1)x/2 and probably allows formation of
defects on the surface, i.e., oxygen vacancies and thus
low coordinated Mg sites.
On the basis of the peak position and intensity the

Recent ab initio and DFT calculations on cluster models
of MgO evidenced that the bands at 2184 and 2148 cm)1
could be attributed, respectively, to adsorption of two
CO molecules to one Mg2+
3C site and to CO molecule
bridged through the carbon atoms over pairs of Mg2+
4C
and Mg2
+
5C sites [27]. The coordination number for
magnesium ions is 5 (Mg2

and 3 (Mg2

3C and O2
)
3C) at the corners of the crystals.
Extensive studies have evidenced the different interac-
tions of Mg2
+
LC towards CO molecules [28].
IR spectra recorded (Fig. 8) show that the starting
high surface MgO shows mainly 5 coordinated sites. In
the case of 1 wt% Li/MgO the surface presents two
different sites, respectively 4 and 5 coordinated, the
latter being the prominent. Over 5 wt% Li/MgO (fig-
ure 8c) surface presents 5, 4, and 3 coordinated Mg sites.

4C coordinated sites dominate the spectrum but at
the same time contribution of three coordinated sites are
easily visible. Thus, lithium doping is seen to create low
coordinated
magnesium
sites.
As
discussed
earlier
(Scheme 1), incorporation of Li in MgO results in
oxygen vacancies and lower coordinated Mg sites. The
IR results presented here confirm thus incorporation of
lithium ions in magnesia matrix. Detailed studies are
planned to explore the influence of lithium ions next to
low coordinated magnesium ions on the adsorption of
CO.
The solgel synthesis thus allows for the incorpora-
tion of Li into the MgO lattice at mild conditions,
results in materials with enhanced surface areas and
defect
site
concentrations.
Li/MgO
catalysts
have
promise as oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts for
making olefins from propane, because consecutive deep
oxidation is by far less prominent as compared to con-
ventional redox catalysts.
5. Conclusions
High surface area nano scale Li/MgO oxide clusters
can
be
synthesized
by
solgel
method
co-gelling
Mg(OCH3)2 and LiNO3. Appreciable amounts of lith-
ium present can be incorporated into the magnesia gel
during preparation and retained in the oxide matrix
after gel combustion. Formation of oxygen vacancies
and low coordinated sites can be followed by infrared
spectroscopy of CO adsorption on Mg2+ Lewis acid
sites. Formation of 4 and 3 coordinated Mg2+ sites
when lithium is present in the MgO matrix indicates the
possibility of the formation of lithium based defect sites
in the catalysts even under the mild conditions required
for the solgel synthesis. In this way as compared to
conventional preparation method temperature necessary
in the preparation of Li/MgO catalysts can be limited
and significant higher surface area can be obtained.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
