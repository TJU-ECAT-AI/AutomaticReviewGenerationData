La2O3 was doped with cations of valencies different to La3+
(Sr2+, Zn2+, Ti4+, Nb5+) to alter the concentration of oxygenanion
vacancies in the host lattice and, hence, oxygen-anion conductivity.
The conductivity and catalytic properties of these solids were
determined between 700 and 850C. An increase in oxygen-anion
conductivity improved C2+ selectivity. A high concentration of
anion vacancies in the catalytic material favours the adsorption
of gaseous oxygen and its immediate transformation into lattice
oxygen; therefrom it is suggested, that the relative amount of
weakly adsorbed electrophilic oxygen species (possibly O
2 , O2
2 )
is diminished in favour of more strongly bounded, nucleophilic
species (O2). Thereby, nonselective surface reactions of methyl
radicals and/or C2+ hydrocarbons with electrophilic oxygen are
suppressed.

INTRODUCTION
In
the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2-
hydrocarbons the nature of oxygen species participating in
the reaction is not yet fully understood. Adsorbed oxygen
species of electrophilic character (e.g., O
2 , O2
2 , O), as
well as lattice oxygen (O2), are supposed to be respon-
sible for CH bond cleavage to produce methyl radicals.
The interaction of adsorbed oxygen species with weakly
adsorbed or gas-phase methane molecules can directly re-
sult in the homolytic formation of a methyl radical (see
reaction [1]) (1, 2), while methane activation via highly
basic surface lattice oxygen follows a heterolytic cleavage
after which the removal of an electron from CH
3 -species
is required to generate methyl radicals (see reaction [2])
(3, 4). In addition, electrophilic oxygen species are also in-
volved in the nonselective oxidation of methyl radicals and

gen entities into lattice oxygen (612). A high surface con-
centration of oxygen anion vacancies favours oxygen ad-
sorption and transformation into less electrophilic species
(O, O2), whereas a low concentration of these defects
gives rise to a high concentration of weakly adsorbed,
molecular oxygen (O
2 , O2
2 ) by which oxygen insertion
to any CHx-species is favoured which leads to total oxida-
tion. Thus the catalytic properties ought to be dependent
on the concentration of vacancies and the mobility of the
oxygen-anions as recently reviewed (6).
It has been reported that many selective OCM catalysts
have oxygen anion vacancies in the oxide lattice, which lead
to the mobility of oxygen anions at temperatures (>700C)
applied in the OCM (7, 1316).
The oxygen-anion conductivity (σ ion) of metal oxides is
related to the concentration of oxygen vacancies c(V••

their charge ze, and their mobility ion (17); using the
KroegerVink-notation one obtains

the mobility further depends on temperature,

BORCHERT AND BAERNS
Besides anionic conductivity most of the selective cata-
lysts exhibit defect electron conductivity (σp), which results
from the uptake of oxygen which interacts with the anion
vacancies (18).
In the present work, La2O3 known as OCM catalyst
(2, 19, 20), was doped with cations having different valen-
cies (Zn2+, Sr2+, Ti4+, and Nb5+) in order to affect the num-
ber of oxygen vacancies in the host lattice. Whereas lower
valent dopants (Sr2+, Zn2+) cause the formation of oxygen-
anion vacancies, their concentration decreases when dop-
ing with cations of higher valency (Ti4+, Nb5+) (6). The total
conductivity (σ ion + σp) as well as the oxygen-anion conduc-
tivities of such catalysts were determined in the tempera-
ture range required for the OCM reaction; the conductivity
data were then related to the corresponding C2+ selectivi-
ties. In interpreting the results it is assumed that the con-
centration of oxygen anion vacancies in the bulk and on
the surface are interrelated by a dynamic equilibrium; i.e.,
the absolute values may be different in the bulk and on the
surface.

La2O3 was doped with 1 at-% of Zn2+, Ti4+, and Nb5+

Characterization of Surface Composition
The surface composition of the SrO/La2O3 catalysts was
determined by XPS (Leybold Heraeus LHS-10 spectrome-
ter, Al Kα X-ray source); the La 3d5/2, O 1s and Sr 3d peaks
were used, applying Wagners sensitivity factors for quan-
titative analysis. The surface concentration of Sr2+ on the
SrO/La2O3 catalysts are listed in Table 2; for comparison
the bulk concentration of Sr is also given.
Catalyst Testing
Catalysts were tested in a catalytic fixed-bed reactor
(8 mm i.d.) made of quartz. Good temperature control of
the reactor was achieved by immersing it into a fluidized
bed of sand serving as a source or a sink of heat. The prod-
uct gas from which water was removed by condensation was
analysed by gas chromatography (21).
The OCM reaction was performed at 973, 1023, 1073, and
1123 K; the feed gas consisted of methane (60 kPa), oxygen
(6 kPa), and nitrogen (34 kPa). For comparison of selec-
tivities obtained at different degrees of oxygen or methane
conversion, respectively, the dependence of C2+ selectivity
on oxygen conversion was investigated by varying the mod-
ified contact time (=mcat/VT,P) from 0.001 to 0.05 g · s · ml1
at 1023 K. When studying the influence of temperature on
selectivity, oxygen conversion was always above 90%.
Conductivity Measurements
The total conductivities of Men+ (1 at-%)-doped La2O3
catalysts were determined by measuring the specific resis-
tance of a catalyst disc with the two-electrode AC method
at 1023 K in dependence on the oxygen partial pressure
(6, 21). The oxygen partial pressures were varied (0.10, 0.32,
1.00, 3.16, 10.0, 31.6, and 100 kPa).
For preparing the catalyst discs the particles (see above)
were first ground and then compacted at 380 MPa into a
disc with a diameter of 7 mm and a thickness of about 3 mm;
subsequently, the disc was sintered in air for 16 h at 1373 K.
To measure the anionic conductivity only, the sample was
sandwiched between two Y2O3 (8 mol%)/ZrO2 discs which
were in contact with the Pt-electrodes; hereby, p-type con-
duction was suppressed (21). The oxygen-anion conductiv-
ity was determined at 923, 1023, 1073, and 1123 K.
EFFECT OF OXYGENANION CONDUCTIVITY
317
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Oxygen-Anion Conductivity
The oxygen-anion conductivity of the catalysts increased
exponentially with temperature. As illustrated in Figs. 1
and 2 the incorporation of lower valent cations (Zn2+, Sr2+)
leads to an increase in anion conductivity; for cations of
higher valency (Nb5+, Ti4+) the opposite effect was ob-
served. At constant temperature oxygen-anion conductivi-
ties of SrO/La2O3 mixed oxides increases with a rising SrO
content and approaches a maximum value at 3 at-%. Higher
dopant concentrations do not result in any significant con-
ductivity change.
The apparent activation energies derived from Figs. 1
and 2arelistedinTable3.IncomparisontoundopedLa2O3,
the addition of Ti4+ and Nb5+ increases the activation en-
ergy for oxygen-anion mobility, while it is decreased by the
addition of Zn2+ or Sr2+. With increasing SrO content the
activation energy diminishes from 109 kJ/mol (undoped
La2O3) to 75 kJ/mol (3 at-% SrO); the activation energy
is not significantly changed by further SrO addition up to
20 at-%.
Since oxygen-anion conductivity is directly proportional
to the concentration of oxygen lattice vacancies the con-
ductivity change caused by altervalent doping with lower-
or higher-valent cations can be attributed to the creation
or depletion of anion vacancies. As the formation of solid
solutions is favoured when the cations of the host and
guest oxide possess similar radii, the incorporation of Sr2+
(r(Sr2+) = 140 pm) into La2O3 (r(La3+) = 124 pm) should
be easier than of Zn2+ (r(Zn2+) = 88 pm) (22, 23). It has
been reported that the solubility limit of SrO in La2O3 is
9 at-% in mixed oxides sintered at 1870 K and increases
with further increase of the sintering temperature; maxi-
mum solubility of 12.5 at-% has been reached near the melt-
ing temperature (about 2570 K) (24, 25). To our knowledge,

no information on ZnO/La2O3 solid solutions is available
in literature. However, it may be assumed that on account
of higher solubility more vacancies are formed by addi-
tion of SrO, resulting in higher conductivity compared with
ZnO/La2O3.
On increasing the Sr2+ content of SrO/La2O3 mixed ox-
ides from 1 to 3 at-% the concentration of anion vacancies
and, thus, conductivity increases, too (24, 26, 27). A still
higher dopant concentration does not result in any further
conductivity increase suggesting that the amount of SrO
dissolved in the host oxide bulk reaches a limit that cannot
be overcome by the preparation conditions applied.
In this context it is worth noting that exposing the cata-
lysts to CO2 or water vapor leads to a loss in conductivity
and also in selectivity; more details have been reported in
(21) and further literature has been cited therein.

is not influenced by the foreign cation. Again, doping La2O3
with Sr2+ and Zn2+ results in an increase in total conductiv-
ity while it is diminished by using Ti4+ and Nb5+ as dopants.
Sr2+ (1 at-%)/La2O3 is more conductive compared to Zn2+
(1 at-%)/La2O.
With increasing oxygen partial pressure the total conduc-
tivity increases due to a rise of p-type conductivity which is
caused by oxygen adsorption on anion vacancies (Eq. [6])

Assuming that O2conductivity is independent of oxygen
partial pressure the contribution of p-type conductivity to
total conductivity can be calculated according to Eq. [7]
(28, 29); p-type conductivities of the catalysts at 1023 K and
PO2 = 10 kPa are listed in Table 4,
σp = σtotal σion.
[7]
As indicated by Eq. [6], p-type conductivity is affected by
anion vacancy concentration. Therefore, when the concen-
tration of unoccupied O2-lattice sites is increased by Sr2+
or Zn2+ doping, not only ionic but also p-type conductivity
is increased; addition of Ti4+ or Nb5+ causes the opposite
effect.

Catalytic Properties
For La2O3 and Men+ (1 at-%)-doped La2O3 catalysts
(Men+ = Sr2+, Zn2+, Ti4+, and Nb5+) the dependence of
C2+ selectivity on oxygen conversion follows a similar pat-
tern,i.e.,theselectivityincreaseswithincreasingconversion
as shown in Fig. 4, (this may be ascribedto the positive effect
of low oxygen concentration at high degrees of conversion
dominating the negative effect of high O2 concentration at
low conversion).
At constant conversion (XO2 > 90%) C2+ selectivity is
enhanced by high temperatures and reaches a maximum at
1123 K (see Fig. 5). It is evident that at comparable reaction
conditions the selectivity is significantly increased by incor-
porating Zn2+ or Sr2+ into La2O3, whereas it is decreased
substantially by doping with Ti4+ and Nb5+.
C2+ selectivity as a function of the Sr2+ content passes
through a maximum at 1 at-% Sr2+. As depicted in Fig. 6,

C2+ selectivity decreases slightly when increasing the Sr2+
content from 1 to 20 at-%.
Correlation between Oxygen-Anion Conductivity
and C2+ Selectivity
The marked differences in selectivity of undoped La2O3
and Men+ (1 at-%)-doped La2O3 catalysts are certainly not
due to their textural properties since their specific surface
areas do not differ significantly (see catalyst preparation).
Also, the beneficial effect of incorporating lower valent
cations cannot be simply ascribed to the change of surface
basicity or acidity, because both the addition of basic SrO
or of acidic ZnO (compared to La2O3 (30)) result in an
enhancement of C2+ selectivity.
The promoting effect of various dopants on C2+ selectiv-
ity appears to be most likely related to a change of oxygen-
anion conductivity. For corroborating this relationship C2+
selectivities of various catalysts (XO2 > 90%) were plotted
as a function of oxygen-anion conductivity in Fig. 7 for dif-
ferent temperatures. As a most intriguing feature this plot
manifests that oxygen-anion conductivity is obviously the
overwhelming catalyst property which affects C2+ selectiv-
ity, i.e., the higher oxygen-anion conductivity the higher C2+
selectivity.
The positive effect of a high oxygen-anion conductiv-
ity may be rationalized in the following manner: a high
concentration of anion vacancies favours the adsorption
of gaseous oxygen and its subsequent transformation into
lattice oxygen. This is also confirmed by the increase in
p-type conductivity reflecting the higher activity with re-
specttooxygentake-up.Asaconsequencenonselectivesur-
face reactions of methyl species and C2 hydrocarbons with
weakly adsorbed oxygen species are suppressed. However,
the temperature dependence of C2+ selectivity cannot be
explained by the temperature dependence of O2conduc-
tivity alone; with increasing temperature the C2+ selectivity
increase is more pronounced than that of conductivity
and approaches a maximum. The activation energies of
the selective (CH4 C2H6 + C2H4) and nonselective steps
(CH4 COx) of the OCM reaction over a SrO (1 wt-%)-
doped La2O3 catalyst were found to be 154 kJmol1 and
100 kJmol1, respectively (31). In contrast, the activation
energy of oxygen-anion conductivity in Sr (1 at-%)-doped
La2O3 amounts only to 96 kJmol1, explaining formally the
stronger temperature dependence of C2+ selectivity. Ac-
cording to Lunsford (1, 32) the higher activation energy
of the selective reaction step can be ascribed to the re-
generation of anion vacancies on the catalyst surface by
dehydration, which is promoted by higher reaction temper-
atures. Therefore, the positive influence of temperature on
C2+ selectivity is due to an increasing oxygen-anion mobil-
ity and an enhanced dehydration, resulting in a higher con-
centration of oxygen-anion vacancies on the surface. This
suggests that selective catalysts require a low activation en-
ergy of oxygen-anion conductivity in order to attain high
oxygen mobilities at low temperatures.
From the above results and the respective discussion
it might be concluded that changes in the foreign-cation
content should affect conductivity and thus, C2+ selectivi-
ty. However, whereas anionic conductivity of SrO-doped
La2O3 increases with increasing SrO content C2+ selectivi-
ty passes through a maximum at 1.0 at-% Sr (see Figs. 2 and
6). The question arises how this selectivity maximum may
be explained. XPS investigations revealed that strontium is
strongly enriched in the near surface layers of the Sr-doped
La2O3 catalysts (see Table 2). Since the surface concen-
tration of SrO exceeded the equilibrium solubility there
appears to be a phase of unsolved SrO on the surface of a
high-conductivity SrOLa2O3 solid solution. Although SrO
is known to be an oxygen-anion insulator its enrichment on
the crystalline surface in the concentration range investi-
gated has no obvious influence on the ionic conductivity of

the catalyst; this fact was also observed by Deportes and
co-workers (33). One might assume that there is a compen-
sating effect between bulk and surface conductivity; i.e.,
whereas conductivity in the bulk is increased with increas-
ing SrO content, conductivity in the near-surface region
decreases due to a low-conductivity marginal layer of seg-
regated SrO, as has been discussed already for CaO/CeO2
solid solutions (34).
According to the above reasoning the catalytic perfor-
mance can be explained as follows: The increasing cover-
age of the catalyst surface by insulating SrO inhibits the
diffusional exchange of oxygen-anions, as well as vacancies
between surface and bulk of the catalyst. Consequently,
the concentration of unoccupied oxygen lattice sites on the
surface decreases, although the bulk defect concentration
increases, leading to higher oxygen-anion conductivity. By
blocking the oxygen anion vacancies, the transformation
of weakly adsorbed oxygen species into lattice oxygen is
restrained markedly, resulting in a selectivity decrease as
compared to the maximum.
CONCLUSIONS
Assuming a dynamic equilibrium between the concen-
tration of oxygen anion vacancies in the bulk and on the
surface of the solid catalyst the incorporation of adsorbed
oxygen in the catalyst is favoured by a high oxygen-anion
conductivity. Hence, the coverage of the surface with elec-
trophilic oxygen species is reduced in favour of nucleophilic
species.Thecorrelationbetweentheanionicconductivityas
a bulk property and the catalytic behaviour as a property of
the surface is only possible as long as the composition of the
bulk and the outmost surface are similar. With increasing
strontium content in a SrO-doped La2O3 catalyst leading
to SrO segregation and its enrichment on the surface the
diffusive exchange of oxygen anions and anionic vacancies
between the bulk and the outer surface is limited. Hereby,
the adsorption of gaseous oxygen and the transformation of
adsorbed oxygen species into lattice oxygen is restrained,
resulting in a selectivity loss.
