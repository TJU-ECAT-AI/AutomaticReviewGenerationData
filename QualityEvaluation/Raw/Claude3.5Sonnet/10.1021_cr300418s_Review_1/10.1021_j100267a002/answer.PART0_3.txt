[1] "The lithium-doped sample was prepared by adding the carbonate to the MgO slurry."

[2] "Lithium-doped MgO, on the other hand, was by far the most active catalyst for the production of gas-phase allyl radicals from propylene."

[3] "The active sites for hydrogen atom abstraction on Li/MgO were also proposed to be surface O- ions; however, in addition to vacancy-O- sites, O- ions were also produced at substitutional lithium ion impurities."

The document does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into the effects of intentional doping, specifically with lithium. The addition of lithium to MgO significantly enhanced its catalytic activity for producing gas-phase allyl radicals from propylene. This suggests that impurities or additives, even in small amounts, can have substantial effects on catalytic performance.

The increased activity of Li-doped MgO was attributed to the creation of additional active sites, namely O- ions produced at substitutional lithium ion impurities. This demonstrates how impurities can alter the surface chemistry of oxide catalysts, potentially creating new active sites or modifying existing ones.

While the document doesn't discuss unintentional doping throughout catalysis history, it implies that such impurities could have played significant roles in catalytic processes, potentially leading to unexpected or unexplained catalytic behaviors. This understanding highlights the importance of considering trace impurities in catalyst characterization and design, as they may have profound effects on catalytic performance.

For modern catalyst design, this historical perspective underscores the need for careful control and characterization of catalyst composition, including trace elements. It also suggests that intentional doping or controlled introduction of impurities could be a powerful tool for tuning catalytic properties and developing more efficient catalysts.

该文档没有直接讨论氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史观点。然而，它确实提供了一些关于有意掺杂效果的见解，特别是锂掺杂。向MgO中添加锂显著提高了其从丙烯产生气相烯丙基自由基的催化活性。这表明即使少量的杂质或添加剂也可能对催化性能产生重大影响。

Li掺杂MgO活性的提高被归因于额外活性位点的创建，即在替代锂离子杂质处产生的O-离子。这表明杂质如何改变氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质，可能创造新的活性位点或修改现有位点。

虽然文档没有讨论催化历史中的无意掺杂，但它暗示这些杂质可能在催化过程中发挥了重要作用，可能导致意外或无法解释的催化行为。这种理解突出了在催化剂表征和设计中考虑微量杂质的重要性，因为它们可能对催化性能产生深远影响。

对于现代催化剂设计，这种历史观点强调了对催化剂成分（包括微量元素）进行仔细控制和表征的必要性。它还表明，有意掺杂或控制引入杂质可能是调节催化性能和开发更高效催化剂的有力工具。
