[1] "The lithium-doped sample was prepared by adding the carbonate to the MgO slurry."

[2] "Lithium-doped MgO, on the other hand, was by far the most active catalyst for the production of gas-phase allyl radicals from propylene."

[3] "The active sites for hydrogen atom abstraction on Li/MgO were also proposed to be surface O- ions; however, in addition to vacancy-O- sites, O- ions were also produced at substitutional lithium ion impurities."

The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide insight into how doping with lithium can significantly enhance catalytic activity. This suggests that throughout history, trace impurities or unintentional additives in oxide catalysts may have played a crucial role in their catalytic performance, often without researchers being fully aware of their influence.

This historical perspective implies that many catalytic processes may have been unknowingly benefiting from or affected by trace impurities. For our current understanding, it highlights the importance of considering even minor components in catalyst composition. In modern catalyst design, this knowledge emphasizes the potential for intentional doping or careful control of impurities to optimize catalytic performance.

文献没有直接讨论氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史角度。但是，它确实提供了关于锂掺杂如何显著提高催化活性的见解。这表明，在历史上，氧化物催化剂中的微量杂质或无意的添加剂可能在其催化性能中发挥了关键作用，而研究人员往往并未完全意识到它们的影响。

这种历史视角意味着许多催化过程可能在不知不觉中受益于或受到微量杂质的影响。对于我们当前的理解，它强调了考虑催化剂成分中甚至微小组分的重要性。在现代催化剂设计中，这种知识强调了通过有意掺杂或仔细控制杂质来优化催化性能的潜力。
