[1] "The lithium-doped sample was prepared by adding the carbonate to the MgO slurry."

[2] "Lithium-doped MgO, on the other hand, was by far the most active catalyst for the production of gas-phase allyl radicals from propylene."

[3] "The active sites for hydrogen atom abstraction on Li/MgO were also proposed to be surface O- ions; however, in addition to vacancy-O- sites, O- ions were also produced at substitutional lithium ion impurities."

The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide an example of how intentional doping can significantly affect catalyst performance. The addition of lithium to MgO greatly enhanced its activity for producing gas-phase allyl radicals from propylene. This suggests that throughout catalysis history, trace impurities or additives may have unintentionally altered catalyst behavior, potentially leading to misunderstandings about the nature of active sites or reaction mechanisms.

This historical perspective implies that our current understanding of catalytic processes may need to be reevaluated, considering the potential role of unintended dopants. For modern catalyst design, it highlights the importance of carefully controlling and characterizing catalyst composition, as even small amounts of additives can dramatically influence catalytic properties. It also suggests that intentional doping could be a powerful tool for enhancing catalyst performance and selectivity in future developments.

虽然文献没有直接讨论氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史视角，但它提供了一个例子，说明有意掺杂如何显著影响催化剂性能。向MgO中添加锂大大提高了其从丙烯产生气相烯丙基自由基的活性。这表明，在催化历史中，微量杂质或添加剂可能无意中改变了催化剂行为，可能导致对活性位点或反应机理性质的误解。

这一历史视角意味着我们当前对催化过程的理解可能需要重新评估，考虑到非预期掺杂剂的潜在作用。对于现代催化剂设计，它强调了仔细控制和表征催化剂成分的重要性，因为即使少量的添加剂也可能极大地影响催化性能。它还表明，在未来的发展中，有意掺杂可能是增强催化剂性能和选择性的强大工具。
