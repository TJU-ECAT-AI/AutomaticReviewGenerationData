[1] "The Li/MgO catalyst was prepared by adding the carbonate to the MgO slurry."

[2] "Previously, it was proposed that the sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on MgO were O- ions associated with intrinsic surface cation vacancies in the MgO lattice"

[3] "The active sites for hydrogen atom abstraction on Li/MgO were also proposed to be surface O- ions; however, in addition to vacancy-O- sites, O- ions were also produced at substitutional lithium ion impurities."

The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide insight into how intentional doping with lithium affects the catalytic properties of MgO. The addition of lithium to MgO creates new active sites for hydrogen abstraction, specifically O- ions associated with substitutional lithium impurities. This suggests that throughout the history of catalysis, trace impurities or additives in oxide catalysts may have unknowingly contributed to their catalytic activity by creating additional active sites or modifying the electronic properties of the catalyst surface.

This historical perspective implies that our current understanding of catalytic processes may need to account for the potential effects of trace impurities or additives that were previously overlooked. It also highlights the importance of careful characterization and control of catalyst composition in modern catalyst design. Understanding the role of dopants and impurities can lead to the intentional development of more effective catalysts by exploiting these effects to create desired active sites or modify catalyst properties.

虽然文献没有直接涉及氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史视角，但它确实提供了关于锂掺杂如何影响MgO催化性能的见解。向MgO中添加锂会创造新的氢提取活性位点，特别是与取代锂杂质相关的O-离子。这表明在催化历史中，氧化物催化剂中的微量杂质或添加剂可能在不知不觉中通过创造额外的活性位点或修改催化剂表面的电子性质而对其催化活性产生了贡献。

这种历史视角意味着我们当前对催化过程的理解可能需要考虑到之前被忽视的微量杂质或添加剂的潜在影响。它还强调了在现代催化剂设计中仔细表征和控制催化剂成分的重要性。理解掺杂剂和杂质的作用可以通过利用这些效应来创造所需的活性位点或修改催化剂性质，从而有意开发更有效的催化剂。
