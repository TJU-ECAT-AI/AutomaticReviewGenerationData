The literature does not directly address the historical use of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does suggest that impurities like lithium can significantly alter the surface reactivity and catalytic properties of oxides like MgO without changing the bulk structure. This implies that throughout catalysis history, many oxide catalysts may have unintentionally contained impurities that affected their performance. 

The example of lithium-doped MgO shows how even small amounts of an impurity can dramatically change surface properties and catalytic behavior. This suggests that historical catalysts likely had varying and poorly understood impurity contents that influenced their activity. Modern catalyst design can benefit from this perspective by carefully controlling and intentionally utilizing dopants to tune catalytic properties. Additionally, the realization that trace impurities can have outsized effects highlights the importance of ultra-pure materials and precise characterization in current catalyst development.

文献没有直接讨论杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂历史中的使用。但是,它确实表明像锂这样的杂质可以显著改变氧化物(如MgO)的表面反应性和催化性能,而不改变其体相结构。这意味着在催化历史上,许多氧化物催化剂可能无意中含有影响其性能的杂质。

锂掺杂MgO的例子表明,即使少量杂质也能极大地改变表面性能和催化行为。这表明历史上的催化剂可能含有不同程度的、未被充分理解的杂质,影响了它们的活性。现代催化剂设计可以从这一角度受益,通过仔细控制和有意利用掺杂剂来调节催化性能。此外,认识到微量杂质可能产生巨大影响,突出了在当前催化剂开发中超纯材料和精确表征的重要性。
