The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into how doping can affect catalyst properties and reactivity. 

The use of Li-promoted MgO as a catalyst for hydrocarbon conversion reactions suggests that impurities like lithium can significantly alter catalytic activity. This implies that throughout catalysis history, trace impurities may have unintentionally influenced catalytic performance without researchers being fully aware.

The discussion of different mechanistic explanations for Li-doped MgO's catalytic activity (Li+O centers vs F-centers) highlights how our understanding of catalytic processes continues to evolve, even for relatively simple systems. This underscores the complexity of unraveling catalytic mechanisms, especially when unintended dopants may be present.

The ability of impurities to profoundly affect surface reactivity without altering bulk structure emphasizes the importance of surface chemistry in catalysis. This realization likely developed gradually over time as analytical techniques improved.

For modern catalyst design, these insights suggest the need for careful control and characterization of material purity, as well as the potential to strategically use dopants to tune catalytic properties. Understanding the role of impurities in historical catalysts may help explain inconsistencies in past results and inform more precise design of future catalysts.

文献并未直接讨论氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史角度。然而，它确实提供了一些关于掺杂如何影响催化剂性质和反应活性的见解。

锂促进的MgO作为碳氢化合物转化反应的催化剂的使用表明，像锂这样的杂质可以显著改变催化活性。这意味着在催化历史中，微量杂质可能在研究人员没有充分意识到的情况下无意中影响了催化性能。

对Li掺杂MgO催化活性的不同机理解释的讨论（Li+O中心vs F中心）突出了我们对催化过程的理解仍在不断发展，即使对于相对简单的系统也是如此。这强调了揭示催化机理的复杂性，特别是当可能存在意外掺杂物时。

杂质能够在不改变体相结构的情况下深刻影响表面反应活性，这强调了表面化学在催化中的重要性。这一认识可能随着分析技术的改进而逐渐发展。

对于现代催化剂设计，这些见解表明需要仔细控制和表征材料纯度，以及可能战略性地使用掺杂剂来调节催化性能。了解杂质在历史催化剂中的作用可能有助于解释过去结果中的不一致性，并为未来更精确的催化剂设计提供信息。
