The given literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts or their unintentional use as doped catalysts. The document focuses on statistical analysis of past catalytic data for oxidative methane coupling (OCM) to identify high-performance catalyst compositions. It does not discuss the broader historical context of impurities in catalysis or their implications for modern catalyst design. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.
