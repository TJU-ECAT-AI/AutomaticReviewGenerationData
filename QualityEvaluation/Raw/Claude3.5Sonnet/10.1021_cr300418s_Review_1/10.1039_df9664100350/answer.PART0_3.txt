[1] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk ; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[2] "The process which we have observed on pure MgO is too rapid to be identified with this sort of electron transfer ; furthermore, the impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

The historical use of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has contributed significantly to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. Even in studies attempting to use pure oxides, trace impurities have been shown to affect catalytic behavior. This historical perspective highlights the importance of considering even minute quantities of dopants or impurities when studying catalytic processes.

The implications for our current understanding are profound. It suggests that many historical studies on supposedly "pure" oxides may have actually been investigating doped systems without realizing it. This realization emphasizes the need for extremely precise control and characterization of catalyst composition in modern research.

For modern catalyst design, this historical perspective underscores the potential for trace additives to dramatically alter catalytic properties. It encourages researchers to carefully consider and potentially exploit the effects of small quantities of dopants to enhance catalyst performance. Additionally, it highlights the importance of using highly purified materials and advanced analytical techniques to fully understand the true composition and behavior of catalytic systems.

杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂中的历史使用大大促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的无意使用。即使在试图使用纯氧化物的研究中，微量杂质也被证明会影响催化行为。这一历史视角突出了在研究催化过程时考虑即使是微量掺杂剂或杂质的重要性。

这对我们当前的理解有深远的影响。它表明，许多关于所谓"纯"氧化物的历史研究实际上可能在不知不觉中研究了掺杂系统。这一认识强调了在现代研究中对催化剂成分进行极其精确的控制和表征的必要性。

对于现代催化剂设计，这一历史视角强调了微量添加剂可能会显著改变催化性能。它鼓励研究人员仔细考虑并可能利用小量掺杂剂的效果来提高催化剂性能。此外，它突出了使用高纯度材料和先进分析技术的重要性，以充分理解催化系统的真实组成和行为。
