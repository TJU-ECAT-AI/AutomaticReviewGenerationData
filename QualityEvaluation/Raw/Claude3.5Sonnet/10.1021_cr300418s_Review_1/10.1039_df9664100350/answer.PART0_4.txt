[1] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[2] "The process which we have observed on pure MgO is too rapid to be identified with this sort of electron transfer; furthermore, the impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

The literature suggests that impurities and additives have indeed contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. Even in seemingly pure MgO, trace amounts of transition metal impurities can influence oxygen adsorption behavior. This historical perspective implies that many catalytic processes attributed to pure oxides may have actually been influenced by unintended dopants.

This understanding has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design. It highlights the importance of considering even trace impurities when studying catalytic mechanisms. For modern catalyst design, it suggests that intentional doping with small amounts of transition metals could be a powerful strategy for enhancing catalytic performance. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for highly pure materials and precise characterization techniques in fundamental catalysis research to accurately distinguish between the effects of the primary catalyst and any impurities.

文献表明，杂质和添加剂确实在催化历史中无意中促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用。即使在看似纯净的MgO中，微量的过渡金属杂质也会影响氧气吸附行为。这一历史视角意味着许多被认为是由纯氧化物引起的催化过程可能实际上受到了无意添加的掺杂剂的影响。

这种理解对我们当前对催化过程的认识和现代催化剂设计的发展有重要影响。它强调了在研究催化机理时考虑微量杂质的重要性。对于现代催化剂设计，它表明有意添加少量过渡金属可能是提高催化性能的有效策略。此外，它还强调了在基础催化研究中需要高纯度材料和精确表征技术，以准确区分主要催化剂和任何杂质的影响。
