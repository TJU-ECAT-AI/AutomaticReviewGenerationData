[1] "The difficulty of comparison with NiO is acute when we come to discuss the catalytic activities. Oxygen poisoning of NiO is so prevalent that little or no agreement exists about the specific activity or activation energy for N20 decomposition on NiO."

[2] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk ; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[3] "The impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into how impurities can affect catalytic processes:

1. Impurities can significantly impact catalytic activity, as evidenced by the difficulty in comparing NiO catalysts due to oxygen poisoning.

2. Even small amounts of transition metal impurities in MgO can participate in oxygen adsorption processes, potentially affecting catalytic behavior.

3. The standardization of catalyst purity (e.g., spectroscopically standardized MgO) suggests that researchers have become aware of the impact of impurities on catalytic processes.

These points imply that impurities may have unintentionally influenced catalytic processes throughout the history of catalysis research. This historical perspective highlights the importance of considering and controlling impurities in modern catalyst design and emphasizes the need for precise characterization of catalyst composition and purity in current research.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史角度。但是，它确实提供了一些关于杂质如何影响催化过程的见解：

1. 杂质可以显著影响催化活性，这从由于氧中毒而难以比较NiO催化剂的情况中可以看出。

2. 即使在MgO中存在少量的过渡金属杂质也可以参与氧气吸附过程，可能影响催化行为。

3. 催化剂纯度的标准化（例如，光谱标准化的MgO）表明研究人员已经意识到杂质对催化过程的影响。

这些点暗示，在催化研究的历史中，杂质可能无意中影响了催化过程。这种历史视角突出了在现代催化剂设计中考虑和控制杂质的重要性，并强调了在当前研究中精确表征催化剂成分和纯度的必要性。
