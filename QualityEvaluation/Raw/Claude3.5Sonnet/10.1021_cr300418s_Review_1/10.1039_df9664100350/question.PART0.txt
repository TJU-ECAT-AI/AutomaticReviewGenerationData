Oxygen Chemisorption and the Catalysis of N20 
Decomposition on NiO-MgO and Related Solid Solutions 
BY A. CIMINO,* 
M. SCHIAVELLO 
AND F. S. STONE 
$ 
Received 3rd January, 1966 
By preparing at 1200C solid solutions of formula NixMgl,&, 
where ions of stable valency 
(Mg2f) are interposed between nickel ions without change in structure, it has been possible to study 
how the chemisorption properties and the catalytic activity of the transition metal ions are influenced 
by isolation. Solid solutions of the type NixLiYMg-,O 
have also been investigated. 
Chemisorption of oxygen has been studied from -78 to 550C and catalysis of N20 decom- 
position from 300 
to 500C. The activity per nickel ion is found to increase as the ions are diluted 
by magnesium ions, reaching a maximum at about 1 % nickel. Chemisorption occurs preferentially 
on nickel ions, and activity in the catalysis is paralleled by the occurrence in chemisorption studies 
of a reversible type of oxygen adsorption which develops as 
nickel ions are diluted. 
The drift of charge across an array of Ni2+/Ni3+ 
ions, which gives rise to 
p-type semiconductivity 
in NiO, is considered to be much less relevant for the catalysis of N20 decomposition than the 
nature of the octahedral complex formed at the surface by chemisorbed oxygen. Several forms of 
oxygen chemisorption are discussed, including a strong form which occurs on lithium-containing 
specimens and inhibits the catalysis. 
Many of the researches on catalysis by metal oxides published since the 1950 
Faraday Society Discussion on heterogeneous catalysis have attempted to define a 
relationship between semiconductivity and catalysis. The theme was of sufficient 
generality and elegance to demand thorough investigation, and in the last 15 years 
about a hundred papers prompted by this topic have appeared on zinc oxide and 
nickel oxide alone. ZnO was a good choice as an archetype, and the concept of free 
carriers and donors, the latter mobile at high temperatures, continues to assist the 
development of ideas on the role of the chemisorbed state in catalysis and photo- 
catalysis on this oxide. Nickel oxide, on the other hand, has not yielded correspond- 
ing dividends. In the first place the simple band theory is not a good approximation, 
and secondly the chemistry of its lattice imperfections is still incompletely 
understood. 
The link between semiconductivity and catalysis is consequently much less direct and 
currently of limited heuristic value. This is unfortunate, since the quantitative 
approach provided by band theory cannot be matched at present by theories based on 
Heitler-London and crystal field approximations. It is possible to set up localized 
models of co-ordination and charge transfer (or covalent ligancy) at oxide surfaces, 
as Dowden 1 and others 2 have done, but this still leaves the formidable problem 
of estimating the relative contributions from Coulombic, polarization and crystal 
field stabilization energies, as recently pointed out by Dickens and Sutcliffe.3 There 
is a need to devise experiments in chemisorption and catalysis on oxides which are 
specifically amenable to discussion in terms of the localized viewpoint. This can be 
achieved by investigating systems in which electronic and magnetic interaction is

limited, as when true solid solutions are formed between the transition metal oxide 
and an isomorphous, weakly active matrix which is insulating and diamagnetic.4

In order to throw light on the role of the chemisorbed species in catalysis, combined 
studies of adsorption and catalysis are required. In the present research we have 
used magnesium oxide as a matrix, and distributed Ni2+ and Ni3f ions by forming 
at high temperature specimens of formula Ni,Mgl-,O 
and Ni,Li,Mgl-,-,O, 
with x 
between 0.001 and 0.1. N20 decomposition has been chosen as the catalytic reaction, 
partly in view of its relative simplicity but also because of the general interest in 
chemisorbed oxygen. Nitrogen is not chemisorbed, so the relevant chemisorbed 
states involved are those of nitrous oxide and oxygen. Oxygen is often considered 
to take different chemisorbed forms depending on the temperature and on the solid 
substrate, and one would expect the catalysis of N20 decomposition to be directly 
affected. We shall show that this is so. Chemisorption of oxygen has been measured 
from -78 to 550C on the solids of greatest catalytic interest, thereby spanning 
the full range (300 to 500C) studied in the heterogeneous catalysis. Chemisorption 
receives the greater attention in the experimental part of this paper as some of the 
catalytic results are already in the course of publication elsewhere.5 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Solid solutions Ni,Mgl,O 
and Ni,Li,Mgl,,O 
have been prepared 5 by impregnation 
of magnesium oxide with solutions of nickel nitrate and lithium carbonate, followed by a 
first heating in air at 600C and, after re-grinding, a second heating at 1200C. Specimens 
prepared in this way have been examined by X-ray powder diffraction, optical reflectance 
spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility and e.s.r. Surface areas have been determined by 
B.E.T. measurements with nitrogen or krypton at 77K. The nickel and lithium contents 
quoted are nominal ones, i.e., those based on the amounts of nickel and lithium originally 
added to the magnesium oxide during impregnation. Subsequent analysis confirmed that 
there w
a
s
 
no loss of nickel on firing. Lithium, however, was lost. For instance, analysis 
by flame photometer showed that a specimen of Ni,Li,Mgl,,O 
with nickel and lithium 
nominal concentrations of 1 % lost 95 % of its lithium on firing at 1200C. In spite of such 
losses, the remaining small lithium contents exert profound effects on the properties of the 
NiO-MgO solid solutions, as will be seen later. The presence of Ni3+ ions in fired 
Ni,Li,Mg,,O 
specimens has been confirmed by e.s.r. studies.6 
RESULTS 
A. CHEMISORPTION OF OXYGEN 
The chemisorption of oxygen has been studied by the conventional manometric 
method using a fixed volume system suitable for pressures from 0.005 to 0-15 torr 
(Pirani gauge) and 0.15 to 0.6 torr (McLeod gauge). The specimen was contained 
in a silica bulb and after installation was pre-treated by outgassing for many hours 
at 850C and 10-6 torr. Thereafter a succession of adsorption experiments was 
performed on the given specimen, a standard outgassing procedure of 1 h at 850" 
being adopted between the runs. After a few such runs, reproducibility was attained, 
and results were then accumulated by conducting individual experiments at different 
pressures and temperatures. The normal procedure with each catalyst was to scan 
the full temperature range at 0.4 torr and then to complete a set of 16 individual 
experiments at -78, 0, 200 and 500C (four pressures between 0.05 and 0.5 torr for 
each temperature). In addition, tests for reversibility of the chemisorption were 
made at each temperature by observing the amount of gas which could be re-adsorbed 
after evacuation. Evacuation was carried out at the same temperature and for the 
same time as employed in the adsorption. Kinetics of chemisorption were not

studied in detail ; the adsorption process, however, was normally rapid and unless 
otherwise stated the ordinates on adsorption isobars refer to amounts adsorbed 
after 30 min. 
The four solids selected for study as having the greatest significance 
for the catalytic 
work described in 5 C were (i) pure magnesium oxide (MO), (ii) Ni,Mgl-,O 
with 
x-0.01 (MN l), (iii) Ni,Mgl-,O 
with x-0.1 (MN 10) and (iv) Ni,Li,Mgl-,,O 
with x-0.01 and y (nominal) -0.01 (MNL 1 : 
l).* Their surface areas were 44, 12, 
12 and 0.82mz/g respectively, the pure MgO having also been heated to 1200C. 
Coverages are expressed on the basis of a monolayer value for oxygen of 0.20 cm3 m-2. 
This coverage scale can be regarded as arbitrary, but it does, in fact, correspond to 
one in which the monolayer is regarded as one oxygen atom adsorbed on each cation 
of a surface made up of equal areas of (loo), (1 101 and (

possess the same crystal structure and the lattice parameter varies by less than 1 %.

Adsorption isobars constructed from experiments at 0.4 torr are shown in fig. 1 
for MO, MN 1 and MN 10. It is evident that at 0C and above the solid solutions 
are more active than pure magnesium oxide, confirming that the transition metal ion 
possesses greater specific activity in oxygen chemisorption than the magnesium ion. 
The same result is observed also at the other pressures studied. The most interesting

chemisorption on MN 10 above 250C should also be noted. The isobar for MN 1 
has been extended to 700C in other experiments, but no similar point of inflexion has 
been observed for this solid solution. 
Fig. 2 shows adsorption isotherms at ca. 200 and 500"C, the first temperature 
being below the onset of the new trend for MN 10 and the second above it. It is 
apparent that most of the increased chemisorption on MN 10 at 500" is achieved 
already at the lowest pressures, typical of a strong adsorption. The different pressure

dependence at 200" on MN 1 and MN 10, 
whose isotherms are seen to diverge 
appreci- 
ably, points to the fact that although the coverage 
is larger on MN 1, the chemisorption 
is weaker. The apparently greater amount of adsorption on MO at -78" compared 
to MN 10 (see fig. 1) is not significant, as the isotherms for this temperature run very 
close together. 
The existence of a weak form of oxygen adsorption at low temperatures is indicated 
already in fig. 1 by the minimum in the adsorption isobar for pure magnesium oxide 
at ca. 50C. The studies of reversibility amply confirm this observation (table 1) 
and show, furthermore, that the phenomenon is general. Thus, all the oxygen 
chemisorbed at 0" can be desorbed by pumping for 30min at this temperature. 
At 200" and above, however, it is quite otherwise. Each of the three oxides develops 
characteristics of its own. With MgO there is a transition from complete reversibility 
at 0" to only one-fifth reversibility at 200" : it is clear that at least half the gas chemi- 
sorbed at 0" becomes converted to a strongzr form at 200". More significantly, 
however, it follows that in the neighbourhood of 200" the specific adsorption on Ni2f 
ions (i.e., the excess over that shown by the MgO matrix) is primarily in the form o
f
 
reuersibly-held oxygen. This is most clearly seen by comparing figures for MO and 
MN 1 in table 1. The excess of coverage shown by MN 1 at 200" and 0.4 torr is 0.29 
units; of this excess, 0.21 units is represented by reversibly-held gas. Finally, by 
500" the high-temperature chemisorption of MN 10 reveals itself by a lower absolute 
coverage of reversibly-held gas as well as by the higher total coverage already noted 
in fig. 1. It is obviously a very strong form of chemisorption.

however, the rate was much slower than this (fig. 3). The new chemisorption 
process above 200" is therefore a slow process, and as such is compatible with its 
being a strong adsorption. On MN 1 the rates at all temperatures were comparable 
to those at the lower temperatures on MN 10. On MO, on the other hand, the rates 
of adsorption were faster at all temperatures than on the solid solutions. We con- 
clude that the extensive specific adsorption on Ni2+ ions shown by MN 1, although 
predominantly a reversible adsorption, is nevertheless involving a greater activation 
energy than

It remains to present the results on MNL 1 : 1. The isobar at 0.44 torr is shown 
in fig. 4, together with that for MN 1 at 0.40 torr. The main observation is that the 
oxygen chemisorption coverage on MNL 1 : 1 is an order of magnitude greater than 
on MN 1 or MN 10. It is also a more rapid adsorption, and at any given temperature 
the proportion of gas reversibly held is lower, falling to 8 % at 500C compared with 
43 % on MN 1. All these results point to a much stronger chemisorption of oxygen 
than on the Ni,Mgl-,O 
solid solutions.

The chemisorption of N20 was investigated on the same four specimens as used 
for the oxygen studies. Experiments above 50C were not practicable on account of 
the small amount of adsorption and (except for MO) the onset of decomposition.

but only 0.05 % on MN 10. On MNL 1 : 
1 the corresponding coverage was 0.8 %. 
The adsorption was reversible and strongly pressure-dependent. Isotherms at 0 and 
40" are shown in fig. 5, where it is seen that the adsorbed amounts decrease with 
increasing temperature. The decrease, however, is not as great as would be expected 
on the basis of additional isotherms measured in the region of predominantly physical 
adsorption between - 
80 and - 
40, where the heat of adsorption was approximately 
5 kcallmole. We infer from this that some chemisorption is occurring at tempera- 
tures above 0" and that the isotherms at 0 and 40" probably do not correspond to 
true adsorption equilibrium. In cases of chemisorption the ability to desorb readily 
cannot be adduced as evidence that there is thermodynamic equilibrium ; 
for instance, 
we have seen in the oxygen measurements that the chemisorption on MN 1 and MN 10 
at 0" was reversible, but the adsorbed amounts were actually increasing with increasing 
temperature. 
The evidence for chemisorption of N2O at 0" is supported indirectly by the fact 
that catalytic decomposition in the adsorbed film could be detected on MN 1, and on 
standing at 40' the decomposition on MN 1, MN 10 and MNL 1 : 
1 was appreciable. 
By contrast, no decomposition was observed on pure magnesium oxide. 
c. CATALYSIS OF N20 DECOMPOSITION 
The catalytic properties of MgO, Ni,Mgl-,O 
and Ni,Li,Mgl-,-,O 
in N20 
decomposition have been studied in detail at 300-500C. Results obtained on a 
number of specimens, which gave a first appraisal of the behaviour of these systems, 
are given elsewhere,s together with full particulars of the experimental procedure. 
A wider range of catalysts has since been investigated, and kinetics have also been 
examined further. The detail will appear in a separate publication.8 In this section 
we give only a summary of the catalytic results, sufficient 
to integrate the presentation 
and to illustrate the relevance of the chemisorption data in understanding the catalytic 
behaviour . 
The decomposition has been studied in a static system at approximately 60 torr. 
The reaction was followed by sampling, freezing out unreacted N20 and measuring 
the amount of gaseous products manometrically or mass spectrometrically. Kinetic 
studies have shown that poisoning is a common occurrence when nickel ions are 
present. For this reason, comparisons of activity between the various catalysts have 
been primarily based on measurements of initial rates (< 
1 % decomposition). 
In addition to pure MgO, catalytic studies have been made on solid solutions 
Ni,Mgl-,O 
with Ni : 
Mg ratios equal to 0.1, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.0015, accordingly 
designated MN 10, MN 1, MN 0.5 and MN 0-15 
(i.e., x-0.1, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.0015 
respectively). Two solid solutions Ni,LiyMg-,--,O corresponding to the designations 
MNL 1 : 
1 and MNL 10 : 
1, i.e., x-0.01, y(nomina1) -0.01 and x-0.1, y(nomina1) 
-0.01 respectively, have also been investigated. The surface areas of all MO and 
MN catalysts were between 10 and 20 m2/g ; those of MNL were much lower. 
Fig. 6 summarizes in the form of Arrhenius plots the specific activities of the seven 
different catalysts, the velocity constants referring to unit surface area. A number of 
important conclusions can be drawn : (i) the least active catalyst is pure magnesium 
oxide, (ii) the addition of nickel ions in solid solution at concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 
10 % increases the velocity constant at 400C by an order of magnitude, and decreases 
the activation energy, (iii) the most active catalyst is not MN 10, but MN 1, and 
(iv) the incorporation of small amounts of lithium in the solid solutions markedly 
increases the activation energy E. The catalysts of greatest interest as representing 
extremes of behaviour are MO (least active and highest E), MN 1 (most active and 
lowest E), MN 10 (lowest activity per Niz+ ion of MN series) and MNL 1 : 
1 (highest

for the chemisorption 
studies described in Q A and B. 
Mass spectrometric analysis of samples of the gaseous products during the first

oxygen is being held on the surface. From the magnitude of the N2/02 ratio, and

knowing the number of N20 molecules admitted, the volume of the vessel and sampler, 
the area of the catalyst and the pressure of incondensable gas in the sample, it is 
possible to estimate the coverage of adsorbed oxygen at the reaction temperature 
during CdtdlySiS. The results are shown in table 2. It may be seen that the coverages 
at ca. 400C are in the order MO< MN 1 
<MN 10< 
MNL 1 : 1. The direct chemi- 
sorption experiments (A), which have much higher accuracy, were carried out at 
oxygen pressures from 0-4 
to 0.05 torr. The amounts of decomposition in the experi- 
ments of table 2 vary between 1 and 0.15 % ; these amounts at 60 torr (the initial 
N20 pressure during catalysis) correspond to partial pressures of oxygen of 0-3 and 
0.05 torr respectively, showing the significance of the pressure range selected for the 
experiments of A. A comparison may be made of the coverages determined by 
the two methods by reference to fig. 1, 2 and 4, with appropriate interpolation. It is 
evident that not only is the sequence of coverages on the four solids the same as that

observed in the direct chemisorption experiments at high temperatures, but also the 
magnitudes are in satisfactory agreement. This is an important check, for it confirms 
that we are justified in applying the chemisorption data of  A  
in discussions of the 
chemisorbed situation during the catalysis. 
DISCUSSION 
COMPARISON WITH NICKEL OXIDE 
The results prove conclusively that nickel ions isolated in a matrix of magnesium 
oxide are specifically active in chemisorption and catalysis. Moreover, the activity 
per nickel ion is greater when present at dilutions of 0.5 or I % than at 10 %. The 
coverage of chemisorbed oxygen which is specific to the nickel ions of the surface is 
readily seen from fig. 1 and table 1. Assuming that the magnesium oxide matrix 
behaves identically in MO and MN specimens, the excess coverage on MN 1 at 0C 
and 0
.
4
 
torr is 0.36% (0.23 % at 500"). For MN 10 the corresponding figures are 
0.11 and 0.54 %. For a random solution in which every Nizf ion in the surface is 
assumed to be active, the maximum excess coverage that could be expected is 1 % on 
MN 1 
and 10 % on MN 10. Thus the nickel ion couerage on MN 1 is 36 % at 0" 
and 
23 % at 500", and on MN 10 it is 1 % at 0" and 5 % at 500". 
Typical literature values of nickel ion coverage on pure nickel oxide of comparable 
surface area range from 1 to 15 %. For example, there are reported coverages at 
0.06 torr of 1 % at 20, 10 % at 250" and 6 % at 450" ;2 at 0.03 torr, 15 % at 353" 
;9 
at 0.1 torr, 15 % at 260O.10 
On this reckoning, therefore, MN 1 is considerably more 
active per nickel ion than NiO itself. The respective behaviour of MN 1 and MN 10 
confirms the trend, and this in fact is a more valid comparison than that with NiO 
since the two solid solutions had precisely the same specific area and pre-treatment. 
It is possible that the lower figures for coverage on MN 10 and NiO may reflect a 
greater difficulty in cleaning the surface of chemisorbed oxygen at the start of the 
experiment : the stronger the chemisorption on an oxide the more likely it is that the 
process studied (and the coverage estimated) in a chemisorption experiment is one in 
which the residue of a chemisorbed layer is re-filled. This, however, would merely 
endorse the view that oxygen chemisorption on MN if) 
and NiO is stronger (and less 
reversible) than on MN 1. 
The difficulty 
of comparison with NiQ is acute when we come to discuss the catalytic 
activities. Oxygen poisoning of NiO is so prevalent that little or no agreement 
exists about the specific activity or activation energy for N20 decomposition on NiO. 
Our own values for the activation energy, measured under conditions comparable 
to those in which the MN series of catalysts were studied, ranged from 23 to 36 kcal/ 
m0le.5 Taken together with our results on MN 10 and MN 1, this again suggests 
to us that activity increases 
with dilution in the range from 1-00 
to 0.01 in Ni,Mgl-,O. 
Quite irrespective of the activity inCredSe, however, is the conclusion made possible 
by our results that a well-developed p-type semiconductivity such as NiQ exhibits is 
not necessary in order for the nickel ion to exhibit high activity in chemisorption and 
catalysis in this system. In other words, the conclusion may be drawn that the 
catalyst does not function well in this reaction simply because of its high concentration 
of positive h 
Aes, but because other parameters contribute to the characteristics of 
the adsorbed complexes.

and not relevant to N20 decomposition. We consider that it is probably to be 
identified with the molecular adsorption reported on similar insulator oxides by e.s.r. 
studies.11 
In the range of temperature from -78 to 400C a specific adsorption develops 
on nickel ions (fig. 1). 
It is an activated process, but is reversible at the temperature 
of measurement. As such it demands our attention as a possibly significant catalytic 
intermediate. The appreciation of its catalytic importance, however, is made clear 
by examination of the properties of MN 1. MN 1 chemisorbs more oxygen at 200" 
than MN 10 and it preserves its content of reversible oxygen even to 500" (table 1). 
Parallel with this result is the observation that over this range of temperature MN 1 
is the more active catalyst in N20 decomposition (fig. 6). We consider that this 
correspondence of properties, which a priori is unexpected on account of the much 
smaller nickel content of MN 1, is sufficiently close for us to be able to attribute the 
high activity of MN 1 to the ability of its nickel ions to produce chemisorbed oxygen 
in this particular form. We return later in the discussion to consider the chemical 
nature of this adsorbed state, since some of our other observations eliminate certain 
possibilities. 
Let us consider the next highest range of temperature, above 400C. This region 
is characterized by the rise of adsorption on MN 10. Charge transfer is certain at 
these temperatures, and we suggest that the activated process involved is the formation 
of 0 2 -  ions accompanied by the transfer of electrons from centres deep in the bulk 
(thus distributing the excess charge and minimizing the repulsion energy). Such 
transfers presumably occur readily in NiO itself, as witnessed by the well-known 
conductivity increases on chemisorption of oxygen. The more dilute the Ni2+02-Niz+ 
array becomes due to interposing the Mgz+ ions the more difficult is the electron 
transfer, not so much because the chains of adjacent transition metal ions are broken 
as the fact that the lattice is becoming more ionic and the electron bands are narrowing. 
Such an electron transfer process would be much easier on MN 10 than MN 1, and 
the high-temperature chemisorption of oxygen in the form of 0 2 -  will be corres- 
pondingly more prevalent. The 0 2 -  chemisorption is to be regarded as a poison for 
the catalysis of N20 decomposition, and the reversible chemisorption of the previous 
paragraph can be looked upon as 
its precursor. 
The strongest-held chemisorbed state of oxygen that we have measured occurs on 
the lithium-containing solutions, and it is prevalent over the whole temperature range. 
As such it can be expected to poison the surface towards the weak chemisorptions, 
and these conclusions are fully confirmed by the catalytic observations. The activa- 
tion energy rises from 18.5 kcal/mole on MN 1 to 30 kcal/mole on MNL 1 : 
1. The 
incorporation of lithium in solid solution in pure NiO is well-known to lead to a 
stronger form of oxygen chemisorption than on NiO itself; comparisons having 
been made by several investigators.9

12 Conversion of Ni2+ to Ni3+ by 
charge compensation from Lif in the MgO matrix could lead to a stronger Coulombic 
attraction between surface cations and chemisorbed oxygen. In addition, the 
fluxing power of lithium must be taken into consideration. The fact that the surface 
area is markedly decreased shows that mobility of both cations and anions is increased, 
and an accumulation of nickel ions, assisted by the attraction of lithium ions for Ni3+, 
could readily occur in the surface layers. Lithium ions do not easily enter the lattice 
of MgO, and this provides an additional reason for expecting abnormally high surface 
concentrations of nickel ions in MNL 1 : 
1. We see this accumulation of nickel ions 
as part of the explanation of the large magnitude of the oxygen uptake on MNL 1 : 
1, 
and its trend above 300C (cf. MN 10). However, there are other possibilities. During 
preparation the entry of Lif ions into the surface layers will be accompanied by the

the latter being suggested by analogy with lithium

ACTIVITY OF THE MgO M A T R I X  
Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorp- 
tion occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition 
metal impurities in the bulk ; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed 
oxygen. The process which we have observed on pure MgO is too rapid to be identi- 
fied with this sort of electron transfer ; furthermore, the impurity concentration in 
our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 
5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to 
account for the observed coverage. The amounts of oxygen which are chemisorbed 
on the MgO specimen agree with those reported by Houghton and Winter 14 in the 
course of their oxygen exchange studies. Charge transfer of the type Mg2+02-+ 
Mg+O- is at least 5 eV endothermic in MgO, but the reaction Mg+0-+302-+ 
O-MgZ+O- would be strongly exothermic. An overall adsorption process of the kind

can be envisaged, the initial charge transfer step being favoured in the surface, 
perhaps on particular planes. Such an adsorption could account for the oxygen 
exchange. 
14 
THE ACTIVE CENTRE 
The specific activity of MN specimens in the N20 decomposition begins to recede 
below MN0.5 (fig. 6). MN0.1 shows mainly the characteristics of the pure MgO 
since the activity of the matrix, although weak, predominates over the small number 
of intrinsically more active Ni2+ sites. With increasing concentration the activity 
of Ni2+ ions emerges to control the catalytic behaviour. However, the increasing 
concentration also introduces adsorption characteristics, shown by the chemisorption 
experiments, which are detrimental for the catalytic activity. This is the reason for 
the decrease in the activity beyond MN 1. 
The active centres must be capable of chemisorbing atoms of oxygen (as opposed 
to molecules) and we imagine that they are held as 0- ions. In speculating further 
the analogue of our proposed chemisorption process on MgO is worth close attention. 
The energy of the charge transfer Ni2+02--Ni+O- 
in the parent oxide can be set at 
about 3.5 to 4eV from the absorption spectrum of NO. The energetics of the 
endothermic part are not as unfavourable as on MgO. However, we should also 
recognize the ability of Ni2+ to form Ni3+. Thus a centre exists on MN capable of 
allowing adsorption in the form shown, especially on (01

steps on (001 1 
planes, and from which oxygen desorption is likely to be easy. The 
proposed mechanism is then one in which two 0- 
ions, originally formed from NzO 
molecules and separately chemisorbed, migrate together over not more than a few 
lattice distances to form the adsorbed state indicated in the sketch. There are 
sufficient of these " 
edgewise " 
adsorbed configurations on nickel ions to account for 
our observed coverages in the chemisorption experiments, and we may also draw 
attention to the crystal field stabilization change which favours adsorption on them.2 
The catalysis of N2Q decomposition, viewed in terms of such a model, is seen to 
depend primarily upon a particular conformation of the chemisorbed oxygen complex. 
The adsorption properties of the surface towards N20 itself are only significant in 
so far as they should permit the initial interaction to be in the nature of a chemisorption 
rather than a physical collision with the surface site. Our experimental data on the 
adsorption of N20, although referring only to lower temperatures, support this view. 
There is little difference between the weak chemisorptions on the MN catalysts, and 
the results with MNL 1 : 
1 indicate that polarization of the N20 molecule is a probable 
source of the adsorption energy.
