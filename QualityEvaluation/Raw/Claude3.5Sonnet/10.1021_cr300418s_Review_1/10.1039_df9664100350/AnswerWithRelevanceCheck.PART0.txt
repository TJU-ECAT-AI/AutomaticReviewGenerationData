          [1] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk ; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[2] "The process which we have observed on pure MgO is too rapid to be identified with this sort of electron transfer ; furthermore, the impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

[3] "The impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

[4] "We conclude that the catalyst does not function well in this reaction simply because of its high concentration of positive holes, but because other parameters contribute to the characteristics of the adsorbed complexes."

[5] "The difficulty of comparison with NiO is acute when we come to discuss the catalytic activities. Oxygen poisoning of NiO is so prevalent that little or no agreement exists about the specific activity or activation energy for N20 decomposition on NiO."

          The historical perspective on impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design:

1. Unintentional doping: Throughout the history of catalysis, impurities in oxide catalysts have likely contributed to unintentional doping effects. Even trace amounts of transition metal impurities can influence catalytic behavior, as demonstrated by the oxygen adsorption studies on MgO.

2. Complexity of catalytic systems: The realization that trace impurities can significantly affect catalytic behavior highlights the complexity of these systems. It emphasizes the need for highly pure materials in fundamental studies and careful characterization of catalyst composition.

3. Reassessment of historical data: The knowledge that impurities play a role in catalysis necessitates a critical reassessment of historical data on oxide catalysts. Some observed catalytic behaviors may have been incorrectly attributed to the primary oxide rather than trace impurities.

4. Shift in focus: The discovery of the impact of impurities has shifted focus from simple correlations between bulk properties and catalytic activity to more nuanced understanding of surface chemistry and defect structures.

5. Intentional doping: Understanding the role of impurities has led to the development of intentionally doped oxide catalysts, where small amounts of additives are used to enhance catalytic performance.

6. Advanced characterization techniques: The need to detect and understand the role of trace impurities has driven the development of more sensitive analytical techniques in catalysis research.

7. Catalyst design strategies: Modern catalyst design now often incorporates intentional doping or the creation of mixed oxide systems, leveraging the knowledge gained from studying the effects of impurities.

This historical perspective underscores the importance of considering even trace components in catalytic systems and has led to a more holistic approach in understanding and designing catalysts for various applications. It also highlights the challenges in comparing catalytic activities of different materials, as exemplified by the difficulties in studying NiO due to oxygen poisoning.

          氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史视角对我们当前对催化过程的理解和现代催化剂设计的发展有重要启示：

1. 无意识掺杂：在催化历史中，氧化物催化剂中的杂质可能导致了无意识的掺杂效应。即使是微量的过渡金属杂质也可能影响催化行为，这从MgO的氧气吸附研究中得到了证明。

2. 催化系统的复杂性：认识到微量杂质可以显著影响催化行为，突显了这些系统的复杂性。这强调了在基础研究中需要高纯度材料，以及对催化剂成分进行仔细表征的必要性。

3. 重新评估历史数据：认识到杂质在催化中的作用，需要对氧化物催化剂的历史数据进行批判性重新评估。一些观察到的催化行为可能被错误地归因于主要氧化物，而不是微量杂质。

4. 研究重点的转变：发现杂质的影响，使研究重点从简单地关联体相性质和催化活性，转向对表面化学和缺陷结构的更细致理解。

5. 有意掺杂：了解杂质的作用导致了有意掺杂的氧化物催化剂的开发，其中少量添加剂被用来增强催化性能。

6. 先进表征技术：需要检测和理解微量杂质的作用，推动了催化研究中更敏感的分析技术的发展。

7. 催化剂设计策略：现代催化剂设计现在常常包括有意掺杂或创建混合氧化物系统，利用从研究杂质效应中获得的知识。

这一历史视角强调了考虑催化系统中甚至微量成分的重要性，并导致了在理解和设计各种应用的催化剂时采用更全面的方法。它还突出了比较不同材料催化活性的挑战，例如由于氧中毒而难以研究NiO的困难。
