[1] "We conclude that the catalyst does not function well in this reaction simply because of its high concentration of positive holes, but because other parameters contribute to the characteristics of the adsorbed complexes."

[2] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[3] "The process which we have observed on pure MgO is too rapid to be identified with this sort of electron transfer; furthermore, the impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (< 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

The literature provides some insights into how impurities and additives have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts:

1. Transition metal impurities in MgO can lead to slow oxygen adsorption and electron transfer above 250°C, even at very low concentrations.

2. However, the authors observed rapid oxygen adsorption on their purified MgO sample, which could not be explained by the low level of impurities present (< 5 ppm).

3. The catalytic activity of nickel ions in NiO-MgO solid solutions was found to depend on factors beyond just the concentration of charge carriers, highlighting the complex role of dopants.

This historical perspective suggests that:

1. Even trace impurities can significantly affect catalytic properties, potentially leading to misinterpretation of results in earlier studies.

2. The role of dopants and impurities in oxide catalysts is more complex than simply altering charge carrier concentrations.

3. Modern catalyst design should consider the specific nature of dopant-surface interactions and their effects on adsorbed species, rather than focusing solely on bulk electronic properties.

4. Careful purification and characterization of oxide catalysts is crucial for understanding their true intrinsic properties and the effects of intentional doping.

文献为我们提供了一些关于杂质和添加剂如何导致无意中使用掺杂氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 即使在非常低的浓度下，MgO中的过渡金属杂质也可能导致在250°C以上缓慢的氧气吸附和电子转移。

2. 然而，作者在其纯化的MgO样品上观察到快速的氧气吸附，这无法用存在的低水平杂质（< 5 ppm）来解释。

3. 在NiO-MgO固溶体中，镍离子的催化活性被发现不仅依赖于载流子浓度，而且还取决于其他因素，突显了掺杂剂的复杂作用。

这一历史视角表明：

1. 即使是微量杂质也可能显著影响催化性能，可能导致早期研究中对结果的误解。

2. 氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂和杂质的作用比仅仅改变载流子浓度更为复杂。

3. 现代催化剂设计应考虑掺杂剂-表面相互作用的具体性质及其对吸附物种的影响，而不是仅仅关注体相电子性质。

4. 对氧化物催化剂进行仔细的纯化和表征对于理解其真正的本征性质和有意掺杂的效果至关重要。
