[1] "Many of the researches on catalysis by metal oxides published since the 1950 Faraday Society Discussion on heterogeneous catalysis have attempted to define a relationship between semiconductivity and catalysis."

[2] "The link between semiconductivity and catalysis is consequently much less direct and currently of limited heuristic value."

[3] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk ; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[4] "The impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

The historical perspective on impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and modern catalyst design:

1. Unintentional doping: Throughout the history of catalysis, impurities in oxide catalysts have likely contributed to unintentional doping effects. This suggests that many early catalytic studies may have been influenced by trace amounts of transition metal impurities, even when researchers believed they were working with pure oxides.

2. Complexity of catalytic systems: The realization that trace impurities can significantly affect catalytic behavior highlights the complexity of these systems. It emphasizes the need for highly pure materials in fundamental studies and careful characterization of catalyst composition.

3. Reassessment of historical data: The knowledge that impurities play a role in catalysis necessitates a critical reassessment of historical data on oxide catalysts. Some observed catalytic behaviors may have been incorrectly attributed to the primary oxide rather than trace impurities.

4. Shift in focus: The discovery of the impact of impurities has shifted focus from simple correlations between bulk properties (like semiconductivity) and catalytic activity to more nuanced understanding of surface chemistry and defect structures.

5. Intentional doping: Understanding the role of impurities has led to the development of intentionally doped oxide catalysts, where small amounts of additives are used to enhance catalytic performance.

6. Advanced characterization techniques: The need to detect and understand the role of trace impurities has driven the development of more sensitive analytical techniques in catalysis research.

7. Catalyst design strategies: Modern catalyst design now often incorporates intentional doping or the creation of mixed oxide systems, leveraging the knowledge gained from studying the effects of impurities.

This historical perspective underscores the importance of considering even trace components in catalytic systems and has led to a more holistic approach in understanding and designing catalysts for various applications.

[1] "We conclude that the catalyst does not function well in this reaction simply because of its high concentration of positive holes, but because other parameters contribute to the characteristics of the adsorbed complexes."

[2] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[3] "The process which we have observed on pure MgO is too rapid to be identified with this sort of electron transfer; furthermore, the impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (< 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

The literature provides some insights into how impurities and additives have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts:

1. Transition metal impurities in MgO can lead to slow oxygen adsorption and electron transfer above 250°C, even at very low concentrations.

2. However, the authors observed rapid oxygen adsorption on their purified MgO sample, which could not be explained by the low level of impurities present (< 5 ppm).

3. The catalytic activity of nickel ions in NiO-MgO solid solutions was found to depend on factors beyond just the concentration of charge carriers, highlighting the complex role of dopants.

This historical perspective suggests that:

1. Even trace impurities can significantly affect catalytic properties, potentially leading to misinterpretation of results in earlier studies.

2. The role of dopants and impurities in oxide catalysts is more complex than simply altering charge carrier concentrations.

3. Modern catalyst design should consider the specific nature of dopant-surface interactions and their effects on adsorbed species, rather than focusing solely on bulk electronic properties.

4. Careful purification and characterization of oxide catalysts is crucial for understanding their true intrinsic properties and the effects of intentional doping.

文献为我们提供了一些关于杂质和添加剂如何导致无意中使用掺杂氧化物催化剂的见解：

1. 即使在非常低的浓度下，MgO中的过渡金属杂质也可能导致在250°C以上缓慢的氧气吸附和电子转移。

2. 然而，作者在其纯化的MgO样品上观察到快速的氧气吸附，这无法用存在的低水平杂质（< 5 ppm）来解释。

3. 在NiO-MgO固溶体中，镍离子的催化活性被发现不仅依赖于载流子浓度，而且还取决于其他因素，突显了掺杂剂的复杂作用。

这一历史视角表明：

1. 即使是微量杂质也可能显著影响催化性能，可能导致早期研究中对结果的误解。

2. 氧化物催化剂中掺杂剂和杂质的作用比仅仅改变载流子浓度更为复杂。

3. 现代催化剂设计应考虑掺杂剂-表面相互作用的具体性质及其对吸附物种的影响，而不是仅仅关注体相电子性质。

4. 对氧化物催化剂进行仔细的纯化和表征对于理解其真正的本征性质和有意掺杂的效果至关重要。

[1] "The difficulty of comparison with NiO is acute when we come to discuss the catalytic activities. Oxygen poisoning of NiO is so prevalent that little or no agreement exists about the specific activity or activation energy for N20 decomposition on NiO."

[2] "Nelson, Tench and Wilkinson 13 have shown by e.s.r. studies that oxygen adsorption occurs slowly on MgO above 250C with simultaneous oxidation of transition metal impurities in the bulk ; electrons are presumably transferred to chemisorbed oxygen."

[3] "The impurity concentration in our spectroscopically standardized MgO (c 5 p.p.m.) is about 30 times too small to account for the observed coverage."

The literature does not directly address the historical perspective of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into how impurities can affect catalytic processes:

1. Impurities can significantly impact catalytic activity, as evidenced by the difficulty in comparing NiO catalysts due to oxygen poisoning.

2. Even small amounts of transition metal impurities in MgO can participate in oxygen adsorption processes, potentially affecting catalytic behavior.

3. The standardization of catalyst purity (e.g., spectroscopically standardized MgO) suggests that researchers have become aware of the impact of impurities on catalytic processes.

These points imply that impurities may have unintentionally influenced catalytic processes throughout the history of catalysis research. This historical perspective highlights the importance of considering and controlling impurities in modern catalyst design and emphasizes the need for precise characterization of catalyst composition and purity in current research.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的历史角度。但是，它确实提供了一些关于杂质如何影响催化过程的见解：

1. 杂质可以显著影响催化活性，这从由于氧中毒而难以比较NiO催化剂的情况中可以看出。

2. 即使在MgO中存在少量的过渡金属杂质也可以参与氧气吸附过程，可能影响催化行为。

3. 催化剂纯度的标准化（例如，光谱标准化的MgO）表明研究人员已经意识到杂质对催化过程的影响。

这些点暗示，在催化研究的历史中，杂质可能无意中影响了催化过程。这种历史视角突出了在现代催化剂设计中考虑和控制杂质的重要性，并强调了在当前研究中精确表征催化剂成分和纯度的必要性。

The historical use of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has contributed significantly to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. Even in studies attempting to use pure oxides, trace impurities have been shown to affect catalytic behavior. This historical perspective highlights the importance of considering even minute quantities of dopants or impurities when studying catalytic processes.

The implications for our current understanding are profound. It suggests that many historical studies on supposedly "pure" oxides may have actually been investigating doped systems without realizing it. This realization emphasizes the need for extremely precise control and characterization of catalyst composition in modern research.

For modern catalyst design, this historical perspective underscores the potential for trace additives to dramatically alter catalytic properties. It encourages researchers to carefully consider and potentially exploit the effects of small quantities of dopants to enhance catalyst performance. Additionally, it highlights the importance of using highly purified materials and advanced analytical techniques to fully understand the true composition and behavior of catalytic systems.

杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂中的历史使用大大促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的无意使用。即使在试图使用纯氧化物的研究中，微量杂质也被证明会影响催化行为。这一历史视角突出了在研究催化过程时考虑即使是微量掺杂剂或杂质的重要性。

这对我们当前的理解有深远的影响。它表明，许多关于所谓"纯"氧化物的历史研究实际上可能在不知不觉中研究了掺杂系统。这一认识强调了在现代研究中对催化剂成分进行极其精确的控制和表征的必要性。

对于现代催化剂设计，这一历史视角强调了微量添加剂可能会显著改变催化性能。它鼓励研究人员仔细考虑并可能利用小量掺杂剂的效果来提高催化剂性能。此外，它突出了使用高纯度材料和先进分析技术的重要性，以充分理解催化系统的真实组成和行为。

The literature suggests that impurities and additives have indeed contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. Even in seemingly pure MgO, trace amounts of transition metal impurities can influence oxygen adsorption behavior. This historical perspective implies that many catalytic processes attributed to pure oxides may have actually been influenced by unintended dopants.

This understanding has significant implications for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design. It highlights the importance of considering even trace impurities when studying catalytic mechanisms. For modern catalyst design, it suggests that intentional doping with small amounts of transition metals could be a powerful strategy for enhancing catalytic performance. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for highly pure materials and precise characterization techniques in fundamental catalysis research to accurately distinguish between the effects of the primary catalyst and any impurities.

文献表明，杂质和添加剂确实在催化历史中无意中促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用。即使在看似纯净的MgO中，微量的过渡金属杂质也会影响氧气吸附行为。这一历史视角意味着许多被认为是由纯氧化物引起的催化过程可能实际上受到了无意添加的掺杂剂的影响。

这种理解对我们当前对催化过程的认识和现代催化剂设计的发展有重要影响。它强调了在研究催化机理时考虑微量杂质的重要性。对于现代催化剂设计，它表明有意添加少量过渡金属可能是提高催化性能的有效策略。此外，它还强调了在基础催化研究中需要高纯度材料和精确表征技术，以准确区分主要催化剂和任何杂质的影响。
