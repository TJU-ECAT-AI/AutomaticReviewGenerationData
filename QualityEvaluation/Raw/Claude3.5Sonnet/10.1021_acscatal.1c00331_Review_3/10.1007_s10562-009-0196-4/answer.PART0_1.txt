[1] "Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size"

[2] "In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)."

[3] "To investigate the influence of diffusion limitations on the oxidation temperature of coke, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 and 3% Pt-SiO2 catalysts having different pore sizes were prepared and deactivated under the same reaction conditions."

[4] "This observation implies that the influence of the pore sizes of the spent catalysts on air diffusion during the oxidation process does not shift the oxidation temperature of coke."

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Smaller pore sizes generally result in lower coke formation. This is demonstrated by the decreasing coke amounts observed for catalysts with decreasing pore sizes.

2. Acidic strength and concentration of the support also affect coke formation, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation.

3. While pore size influences coke yield, it does not appear to significantly affect the oxidation temperature of coke during catalyst regeneration. This suggests that pore size may not have a major impact on the ease of coke removal.

4. The study did not directly address the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance.

These findings have implications for catalyst design:

1. Optimizing pore size is crucial for balancing coke formation with catalytic activity. Smaller pores may reduce coke formation but could also limit reactant access to active sites.

2. Controlling support acidity is important for managing coke formation.

3. Catalyst regeneration strategies may need to focus on factors other than pore size, such as the location of coke deposits relative to active metal sites.

4. Further research into the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical structures could provide additional insights for optimizing catalyst design.

In summary, while pore size plays a significant role in coke formation, other factors such as support acidity and coke location also need to be considered for designing effective PDH catalysts. A holistic approach considering multiple aspects of support structure and chemistry is likely necessary for optimal catalyst design.

文献为丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中催化剂载体孔结构如何影响焦炭形成和催化剂性能提供了一些见解：

1. 孔径对焦炭产量有显著影响。较小的孔径通常导致较低的焦炭形成。这一点从孔径递减的催化剂上观察到的焦炭量递减得到了证实。

2. 载体的酸性强度和浓度也影响焦炭形成，较高的酸性导致焦炭形成增加。

3. 虽然孔径影响焦炭产量，但似乎不会显著影响催化剂再生过程中焦炭的氧化温度。这表明孔径可能不会对焦炭去除的难易程度产生重大影响。

4. 该研究没有直接讨论孔隙连通性、均匀性或分层结构对催化剂性能的影响。

这些发现对催化剂设计有以下启示：

1. 优化孔径对平衡焦炭形成和催化活性至关重要。较小的孔可能会减少焦炭形成，但也可能限制反应物接触活性位点。

2. 控制载体酸性对管理焦炭形成很重要。

3. 催化剂再生策略可能需要关注孔径以外的因素，例如焦炭沉积物相对于活性金属位点的位置。

4. 对孔隙连通性、均匀性和分层结构影响的进一步研究可能为优化催化剂设计提供额外的见解。

总之，虽然孔径在焦炭形成中起着重要作用，但在设计有效的PDH催化剂时，还需要考虑其他因素，如载体酸性和焦炭位置。对催化剂设计的最优化可能需要一种综合考虑载体结构和化学性质多个方面的整体方法。
