[1] "Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size [14]."

[2] "In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)."

[3] "To investigate the influence of diffusion limitations on the oxidation temperature of coke, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 and 3% Pt-SiO2 catalysts having different pore sizes were prepared and deactivated under the same reaction conditions."

[4] "However, the TPO profiles (Fig. 6) of the spent 3% Pt-Al2O3, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 or 3% Pt-SBA-15, 3% Pt-SiO2 have the same oxidation temperatures. This observation implies that the influence of the pore sizes of the spent catalysts on air diffusion during the oxidation process does not shift the oxidation temperature of coke."

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Generally, coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size. This is demonstrated by the observed coke amounts on different catalysts, where larger pore sizes (e.g., 3% Pt-Al2O3) resulted in higher coke yields compared to smaller pore sizes (e.g., 3% Pt-SiO2).

2. While pore size affects coke yield, it does not appear to significantly influence the oxidation temperature of coke. The study found that catalysts with different pore sizes exhibited similar oxidation temperatures during the coke removal process.

3. The literature does not directly address the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on coke formation or catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

4. The acidity of the support also plays a role in coke formation, with increased acidic strength and concentration generally leading to higher rates and extents of coke formation.

These findings suggest that when designing optimal catalysts for PDH reactions, careful consideration should be given to the pore size of the support material. Smaller pore sizes may be beneficial in reducing coke yield, which could potentially lead to improved catalyst stability and longevity. However, the relationship between pore size and catalyst performance is complex, as other factors such as acidity also play important roles.

The study's results imply that catalyst designers should aim for a balance between pore size, acidity, and other support characteristics to optimize coke resistance while maintaining high catalytic activity. Further research into the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements could provide additional insights for designing more effective PDH catalysts.

文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂载体孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的见解：

1. 孔径对焦炭产量有显著影响。通常，随着孔径减小，焦炭产量降低。这一点通过不同催化剂上观察到的焦炭量得到证实，其中较大孔径（如3% Pt-Al2O3）导致较高的焦炭产量，而较小孔径（如3% Pt-SiO2）则产生较少焦炭。

2. 虽然孔径影响焦炭产量，但似乎并不显著影响焦炭的氧化温度。研究发现，具有不同孔径的催化剂在焦炭去除过程中表现出相似的氧化温度。

3. 文献没有直接讨论孔连通性、均匀性或层次结构对PDH反应中焦炭形成或催化剂性能的影响。

4. 载体的酸性也在焦炭形成中起作用，酸性强度和浓度的增加通常会导致更高的焦炭形成率和程度。

这些发现表明，在设计PDH反应的最佳催化剂时，应仔细考虑载体材料的孔径。较小的孔径可能有利于减少焦炭产量，这可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命。然而，孔径与催化剂性能之间的关系是复杂的，因为酸性等其他因素也起着重要作用。

研究结果暗示，催化剂设计者应在孔径、酸性和其他载体特性之间寻求平衡，以优化抗焦性能，同时保持高催化活性。对孔连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响的进一步研究可能会为设计更有效的PDH催化剂提供额外的见解。
