[1] "Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size"

[2] "In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)."

[3] "To investigate the influence of diffusion limitations on the oxidation temperature of coke, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 and 3% Pt-SiO2 catalysts having different pore sizes were prepared and deactivated under the same reaction conditions."

[4] "This observation implies that the influence of the pore sizes of the spent catalysts on air diffusion during the oxidation process does not shift the oxidation temperature of coke."

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Smaller pore sizes generally result in decreased coke formation. This is demonstrated by the varying coke amounts observed on different catalysts, with larger pore sizes correlating to higher coke yields.

2. Acidity of the support also plays a role in coke formation, with stronger acidity and higher concentration leading to increased coke formation rates and extent.

3. While pore size affects coke yield, it does not appear to significantly influence the oxidation temperature of coke during catalyst regeneration. This suggests that pore size may not be a critical factor in determining the ease of coke removal.

4. The study did not provide direct information on the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance.

These findings have implications for catalyst design:

1. Optimizing pore size is crucial for balancing coke formation with catalytic activity. Smaller pores may help reduce coking, but extremely small pores could limit reactant and product diffusion.

2. Controlling the acidity of the support is important for managing coke formation.

3. When designing catalysts for easy regeneration, factors other than pore size (such as metal-support interactions and oxygen mobility on the support) may be more critical to consider.

4. Further research into the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical structures could provide additional insights for optimizing catalyst design in PDH reactions.

文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂支持体孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的见解：

1. 孔径对焦炭产量有显著影响。较小的孔径通常会导致焦炭形成减少。这一点从不同催化剂上观察到的不同焦炭量得到证实，较大的孔径与较高的焦炭产量相关。

2. 支持体的酸性也在焦炭形成中起作用，较强的酸性和较高的浓度会导致焦炭形成速率和程度增加。

3. 虽然孔径影响焦炭产量，但它似乎不会显著影响催化剂再生过程中焦炭的氧化温度。这表明孔径可能不是决定焦炭去除难易程度的关键因素。

4. 该研究未提供有关孔连通性、均匀性或层次结构对催化剂性能影响的直接信息。

这些发现对催化剂设计有以下启示：

1. 优化孔径对于平衡焦炭形成和催化活性至关重要。较小的孔可能有助于减少结焦，但极小的孔可能会限制反应物和产物的扩散。

2. 控制支持体的酸性对于管理焦炭形成很重要。

3. 在设计易于再生的催化剂时，除孔径外的其他因素（如金属-支持体相互作用和支持体上的氧移动性）可能更为关键。

4. 对孔连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响的进一步研究可能为优化PDH反应中的催化剂设计提供额外的见解。

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Smaller pore sizes generally result in lower coke formation. This is demonstrated by the decreasing coke amounts observed for catalysts with decreasing pore sizes.

2. Acidic strength and concentration of the support also affect coke formation, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation.

3. While pore size influences coke yield, it does not appear to significantly affect the oxidation temperature of coke during catalyst regeneration. This suggests that pore size may not have a major impact on the ease of coke removal.

4. The study did not directly address the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance.

These findings have implications for catalyst design:

1. Optimizing pore size is crucial for balancing coke formation with catalytic activity. Smaller pores may reduce coke formation but could also limit reactant access to active sites.

2. Controlling support acidity is important for managing coke formation.

3. Catalyst regeneration strategies may need to focus on factors other than pore size, such as the location of coke deposits relative to active metal sites.

4. Further research into the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical structures could provide additional insights for optimizing catalyst design.

In summary, while pore size plays a significant role in coke formation, other factors such as support acidity and coke location also need to be considered for designing effective PDH catalysts. A holistic approach considering multiple aspects of support structure and chemistry is likely necessary for optimal catalyst design.

文献为丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中催化剂载体孔结构如何影响焦炭形成和催化剂性能提供了一些见解：

1. 孔径对焦炭产量有显著影响。较小的孔径通常导致较低的焦炭形成。这一点从孔径递减的催化剂上观察到的焦炭量递减得到了证实。

2. 载体的酸性强度和浓度也影响焦炭形成，较高的酸性导致焦炭形成增加。

3. 虽然孔径影响焦炭产量，但似乎不会显著影响催化剂再生过程中焦炭的氧化温度。这表明孔径可能不会对焦炭去除的难易程度产生重大影响。

4. 该研究没有直接讨论孔隙连通性、均匀性或分层结构对催化剂性能的影响。

这些发现对催化剂设计有以下启示：

1. 优化孔径对平衡焦炭形成和催化活性至关重要。较小的孔可能会减少焦炭形成，但也可能限制反应物接触活性位点。

2. 控制载体酸性对管理焦炭形成很重要。

3. 催化剂再生策略可能需要关注孔径以外的因素，例如焦炭沉积物相对于活性金属位点的位置。

4. 对孔隙连通性、均匀性和分层结构影响的进一步研究可能为优化催化剂设计提供额外的见解。

总之，虽然孔径在焦炭形成中起着重要作用，但在设计有效的PDH催化剂时，还需要考虑其他因素，如载体酸性和焦炭位置。对催化剂设计的最优化可能需要一种综合考虑载体结构和化学性质多个方面的整体方法。

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Generally, coke yield decreases with decreasing pore size. This is demonstrated by the observed coke amounts on different catalysts, where larger pore sizes (e.g., 3% Pt-Al2O3) resulted in higher coke yields compared to smaller pore sizes (e.g., 3% Pt-SiO2).

2. While pore size affects coke yield, it does not appear to significantly influence the oxidation temperature of coke. The study found that catalysts with different pore sizes exhibited similar oxidation temperatures during the coke removal process.

3. The literature does not directly address the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on coke formation or catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

4. The acidity of the support also plays a role in coke formation, with increased acidic strength and concentration generally leading to higher rates and extents of coke formation.

These findings suggest that when designing optimal catalysts for PDH reactions, careful consideration should be given to the pore size of the support material. Smaller pore sizes may be beneficial in reducing coke yield, which could potentially lead to improved catalyst stability and longevity. However, the relationship between pore size and catalyst performance is complex, as other factors such as acidity also play important roles.

The study's results imply that catalyst designers should aim for a balance between pore size, acidity, and other support characteristics to optimize coke resistance while maintaining high catalytic activity. Further research into the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical arrangements could provide additional insights for designing more effective PDH catalysts.

文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂载体孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的见解：

1. 孔径对焦炭产量有显著影响。通常，随着孔径减小，焦炭产量降低。这一点通过不同催化剂上观察到的焦炭量得到证实，其中较大孔径（如3% Pt-Al2O3）导致较高的焦炭产量，而较小孔径（如3% Pt-SiO2）则产生较少焦炭。

2. 虽然孔径影响焦炭产量，但似乎并不显著影响焦炭的氧化温度。研究发现，具有不同孔径的催化剂在焦炭去除过程中表现出相似的氧化温度。

3. 文献没有直接讨论孔连通性、均匀性或层次结构对PDH反应中焦炭形成或催化剂性能的影响。

4. 载体的酸性也在焦炭形成中起作用，酸性强度和浓度的增加通常会导致更高的焦炭形成率和程度。

这些发现表明，在设计PDH反应的最佳催化剂时，应仔细考虑载体材料的孔径。较小的孔径可能有利于减少焦炭产量，这可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命。然而，孔径与催化剂性能之间的关系是复杂的，因为酸性等其他因素也起着重要作用。

研究结果暗示，催化剂设计者应在孔径、酸性和其他载体特性之间寻求平衡，以优化抗焦性能，同时保持高催化活性。对孔连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响的进一步研究可能会为设计更有效的PDH催化剂提供额外的见解。

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Smaller pore sizes generally lead to decreased coke formation. This is evidenced by the coke amounts observed on different catalysts, with larger pore sizes corresponding to higher coke yields.

However, pore size does not appear to affect the oxidation temperature of coke during catalyst regeneration. The oxidation temperatures were similar across catalysts with different pore sizes, suggesting that pore size does not significantly influence the ease of coke removal.

The acidity of the support also plays a role, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. However, the study notes that this effect is difficult to verify independently of pore size effects.

The literature does not provide direct information on how pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements influence coke formation or catalyst performance. More research would be needed to fully understand these aspects.

For designing optimal catalysts, these findings suggest that using supports with smaller pore sizes could help reduce coke formation while maintaining catalyst activity. However, a balance must be struck, as very small pores could potentially limit reactant and product diffusion. The acidity of the support should also be carefully considered to minimize unwanted coke formation.

文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂支持物孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积碳形成和催化剂性能的见解：

孔径对积碳产量有显著影响。较小的孔径通常会导致积碳形成减少。这一点从不同催化剂上观察到的积碳量得到了证实，较大的孔径对应更高的积碳产量。

然而，孔径似乎不会影响催化剂再生过程中积碳的氧化温度。不同孔径的催化剂的氧化温度相似，这表明孔径对积碳去除的难易程度没有显著影响。

支持物的酸度也起着作用，较高的酸度会导致更多的积碳形成。但是，研究指出，这种效应很难独立于孔径效应进行验证。

文献没有直接提供关于孔连通性、均匀性或层次结构如何影响积碳形成或催化剂性能的信息。需要更多的研究来充分理解这些方面。

对于设计最佳催化剂，这些发现表明，使用孔径较小的支持物可以帮助减少积碳形成，同时保持催化剂活性。然而，必须取得平衡，因为非常小的孔可能会限制反应物和产物的扩散。还应仔细考虑支持物的酸度，以最大限度地减少不必要的积碳形成。
