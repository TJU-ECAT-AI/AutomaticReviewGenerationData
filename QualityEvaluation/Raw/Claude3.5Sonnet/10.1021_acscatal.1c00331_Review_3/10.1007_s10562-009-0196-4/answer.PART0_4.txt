[1] "Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size"

[2] "In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)."

[3] "However, influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size."

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Smaller pore sizes generally result in lower coke formation.

2. Acidity of the support also affects coke formation, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. However, this effect is difficult to isolate from pore size effects.

3. The study compared different catalysts with varying pore sizes, showing that larger pore sizes (e.g., 3% Pt-Al2O3) resulted in higher coke amounts compared to smaller pore sizes (e.g., 3% Pt-SiO2).

4. While pore size clearly influences coke formation, the study does not directly address other aspects of pore structure such as connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements.

5. The implications for catalyst design suggest that optimizing pore size is crucial for minimizing coke formation while maintaining catalyst activity. A balance must be struck between providing sufficient space for reactant diffusion and product formation while limiting excessive coke deposition.

6. The study highlights the complexity of catalyst design, as factors like pore size and acidity interact to influence overall performance. This suggests that a holistic approach considering multiple factors is necessary for developing effective PDH catalysts.

该文献为催化剂支撑体孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成和催化剂性能提供了一些见解：

1. 孔径对积炭产量有显著影响。较小的孔径通常会导致较低的积炭形成。

2. 支撑体的酸性也会影响积炭形成，较高的酸性会导致积炭增加。然而，这种效应很难与孔径效应分离开来。

3. 研究比较了具有不同孔径的催化剂，表明较大孔径（如3% Pt-Al2O3）导致的积炭量高于较小孔径（如3% Pt-SiO2）。

4. 虽然孔径明显影响积炭形成，但该研究并未直接涉及孔结构的其他方面，如连通性、均匀性或层次结构。

5. 对催化剂设计的启示表明，优化孔径对于在保持催化剂活性的同时最小化积炭形成至关重要。必须在为反应物扩散和产物形成提供足够空间与限制过度积炭沉积之间取得平衡。

6. 该研究强调了催化剂设计的复杂性，因为孔径和酸性等因素相互作用影响整体性能。这表明，开发有效的PDH催化剂需要考虑多个因素的整体方法。
