          [1] "Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size"

[2] "In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)."

[3] "To investigate the influence of diffusion limitations on the oxidation temperature of coke, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 and 3% Pt-SiO2 catalysts having different pore sizes were prepared and deactivated under the same reaction conditions."

[4] "This observation implies that the influence of the pore sizes of the spent catalysts on air diffusion during the oxidation process does not shift the oxidation temperature of coke."

[5] "The pore diameters of spent 3% Pt-Al2O3, spent 3% Pt-SBA-15, spent 3% Pt-Al2O3-1, and spent 3% Pt-SiO2 were 7.53, 3.67, 4.59, and 1.0 nm, respectively"

[6] "However, influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size."

          The literature provides several insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Smaller pore sizes generally result in decreased coke formation. This is demonstrated by the varying coke amounts observed on different catalysts, with larger pore sizes correlating to higher coke yields.

2. The study compared catalysts with different pore sizes: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (7.53 nm), 3% Pt-SBA-15 (3.67 nm), 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (4.59 nm), and 3% Pt-SiO2 (1.0 nm). The coke amount decreased in the order: 3% Pt-Al2O3 > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 and 3% Pt-SBA-15 > 3% Pt-SiO2, confirming the inverse relationship between pore size and coke formation.

3. Acidity of the support also plays a role in coke formation, with stronger acidity and higher concentration leading to increased coke formation rates and extent. However, the study notes that this effect is difficult to verify independently of pore size effects.

4. While pore size affects coke yield, it does not appear to significantly influence the oxidation temperature of coke during catalyst regeneration. This suggests that pore size may not be a critical factor in determining the ease of coke removal.

5. The study did not provide direct information on the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance.

These findings have implications for catalyst design:

1. Optimizing pore size is crucial for balancing coke formation with catalytic activity. Smaller pores may help reduce coking, but extremely small pores could limit reactant and product diffusion.

2. Controlling the acidity of the support is important for managing coke formation, but this must be balanced with considerations of pore size.

3. When designing catalysts for easy regeneration, factors other than pore size (such as metal-support interactions and oxygen mobility on the support) may be more critical to consider.

4. Further research into the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, and hierarchical structures could provide additional insights for optimizing catalyst design in PDH reactions.

In summary, while pore size plays a significant role in coke formation, other factors such as support acidity and coke location also need to be considered for designing effective PDH catalysts. A holistic approach considering multiple aspects of support structure and chemistry is likely necessary for optimal catalyst design.

          文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂载体孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的见解：

1. 孔径对焦炭产量有显著影响。较小的孔径通常会导致焦炭形成减少。这一点从不同催化剂上观察到的不同焦炭量得到证实，较大的孔径与较高的焦炭产量相关。

2. 研究比较了具有不同孔径的催化剂：3% Pt-Al2O3（7.53 nm）、3% Pt-SBA-15（3.67 nm）、3% Pt-Al2O3-1（4.59 nm）和3% Pt-SiO2（1.0 nm）。焦炭量按以下顺序减少：3% Pt-Al2O3 > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 和 3% Pt-SBA-15 > 3% Pt-SiO2，证实了孔径与焦炭形成之间的反比关系。

3. 载体的酸性也在焦炭形成中起作用，较强的酸性和较高的浓度会导致焦炭形成速率和程度增加。然而，研究指出这种效应很难与孔径效应分开验证。

4. 虽然孔径影响焦炭产量，但它似乎不会显著影响催化剂再生过程中焦炭的氧化温度。这表明孔径可能不是决定焦炭去除难易程度的关键因素。

5. 该研究未提供有关孔连通性、均匀性或层次结构对催化剂性能影响的直接信息。

这些发现对催化剂设计有以下启示：

1. 优化孔径对于平衡焦炭形成和催化活性至关重要。较小的孔可能有助于减少结焦，但极小的孔可能会限制反应物和产物的扩散。

2. 控制载体的酸性对于管理焦炭形成很重要，但这必须与孔径的考虑相平衡。

3. 在设计易于再生的催化剂时，除孔径外的其他因素（如金属-载体相互作用和载体上的氧移动性）可能更为关键。

4. 对孔连通性、均匀性和层次结构影响的进一步研究可能为优化PDH反应中的催化剂设计提供额外的见解。

总之，虽然孔径在焦炭形成中起着重要作用，但在设计有效的PDH催化剂时，还需要考虑其他因素，如载体酸性和焦炭位置。对催化剂设计的最优化可能需要一种综合考虑载体结构和化学性质多个方面的整体方法。
