[1] "Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size"

[2] "In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)."

[3] "The pore diameters of spent 3% Pt-Al2O3, spent 3% Pt-SBA-15, spent 3% Pt-Al2O3-1, and spent 3% Pt-SiO2 were 7.53, 3.67, 4.59, and 1.0 nm, respectively"

[4] "However, the TPO profiles (Fig. 6) of the spent 3% Pt-Al2O3, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 or 3% Pt-SBA-15, 3% Pt-SiO2 have the same oxidation temperatures. This observation implies that the influence of the pore sizes of the spent catalysts on air diffusion during the oxidation process does not shift the oxidation temperature of coke."

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

Pore size has a significant impact on coke yield. Smaller pore sizes generally lead to decreased coke formation. This is evidenced by the coke amounts observed on different catalysts, with larger pore sizes corresponding to higher coke yields.

However, pore size does not appear to affect the oxidation temperature of coke during catalyst regeneration. The oxidation temperatures were similar across catalysts with different pore sizes, suggesting that pore size does not significantly influence the ease of coke removal.

The acidity of the support also plays a role, with higher acidity leading to increased coke formation. However, the study notes that this effect is difficult to verify independently of pore size effects.

The literature does not provide direct information on how pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements influence coke formation or catalyst performance. More research would be needed to fully understand these aspects.

For designing optimal catalysts, these findings suggest that using supports with smaller pore sizes could help reduce coke formation while maintaining catalyst activity. However, a balance must be struck, as very small pores could potentially limit reactant and product diffusion. The acidity of the support should also be carefully considered to minimize unwanted coke formation.

文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂支持物孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积碳形成和催化剂性能的见解：

孔径对积碳产量有显著影响。较小的孔径通常会导致积碳形成减少。这一点从不同催化剂上观察到的积碳量得到了证实，较大的孔径对应更高的积碳产量。

然而，孔径似乎不会影响催化剂再生过程中积碳的氧化温度。不同孔径的催化剂的氧化温度相似，这表明孔径对积碳去除的难易程度没有显著影响。

支持物的酸度也起着作用，较高的酸度会导致更多的积碳形成。但是，研究指出，这种效应很难独立于孔径效应进行验证。

文献没有直接提供关于孔连通性、均匀性或层次结构如何影响积碳形成或催化剂性能的信息。需要更多的研究来充分理解这些方面。

对于设计最佳催化剂，这些发现表明，使用孔径较小的支持物可以帮助减少积碳形成，同时保持催化剂活性。然而，必须取得平衡，因为非常小的孔可能会限制反应物和产物的扩散。还应仔细考虑支持物的酸度，以最大限度地减少不必要的积碳形成。
