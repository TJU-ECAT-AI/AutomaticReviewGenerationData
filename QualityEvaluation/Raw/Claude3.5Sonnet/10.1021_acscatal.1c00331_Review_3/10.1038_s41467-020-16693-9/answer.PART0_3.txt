<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any specific information about how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text focuses on describing a novel PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst and its performance in PDH, but does not discuss details about support pore structures or their effects. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in the document.
