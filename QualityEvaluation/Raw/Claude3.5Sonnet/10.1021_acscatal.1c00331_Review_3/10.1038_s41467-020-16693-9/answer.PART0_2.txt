The given scientific literature does not contain any information about the influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, or overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on the development and characterization of a PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst for PDH, but does not discuss the specific effects of support pore structures. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided information.
