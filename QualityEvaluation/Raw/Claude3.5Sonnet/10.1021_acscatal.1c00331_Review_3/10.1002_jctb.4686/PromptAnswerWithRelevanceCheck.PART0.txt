The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size distribution: A wide pore size distribution allows coke to cover the external surface of the support rather than the metallic surface, which helps maintain catalyst activity.

2. Surface area and channel properties: Large surface area and appropriate channel properties enhance the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke, as seen in ZSM-5 zeolite supports.

3. Hierarchical pore structures: The introduction of hierarchical pores in modified ZSM-5 (ZQ) changes the pore structure, decreases acid content, and promotes surface properties. These modifications greatly improve the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke.

4. Pore connectivity and uniformity: Although not explicitly mentioned, the improved performance of hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 (ZQ) suggests that better pore connectivity and uniformity contribute to enhanced coke accommodation and catalyst stability.

5. Restriction of metal particle agglomeration: Hierarchical pores in PtSnNa/ZQ inhibit the further agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, improving catalyst stability.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include:

1. Developing supports with hierarchical pore structures to enhance coke accommodation and catalyst stability.
2. Optimizing pore size distribution to direct coke formation away from active metal surfaces.
3. Balancing surface area and channel properties to maximize coke accommodation capacity.
4. Designing pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions.
5. Considering the interplay between pore structure and acid content to achieve desired catalytic performance.

These findings suggest that careful engineering of catalyst support pore structures can lead to improved PDH catalyst performance, longevity, and efficiency.

[1] "Zhang et al.21 compared different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for PtSn-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support were favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles. With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface."

[2] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."

[3] "As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 2080 nm. There are thus two kinds of hierarchical-pores appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals,28 accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ."

[4] "According to these effects, further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process is inhibited, leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. Moreover, by the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly. Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbonmetal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

[5] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size and distribution: A uniform pore size distribution with relatively large surface area favors the dispersion of metallic particles, which is beneficial for catalyst performance. Supports with wide pore size distribution allow coke to cover the external surface rather than the metallic surface.

2. Hierarchical pore arrangements: The introduction of hierarchical pores in ZQ zeolite improved the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke. Two types of hierarchical pores were observed: smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface.

3. Connectivity and accessibility: Hierarchical pore structures enhance the transport of reactants and products, improving catalytic activity and stability.

4. Influence on acidity: The introduction of hierarchical pores modified the acidity of the support material, which affects coke formation and migration.

5. Particle stabilization: Larger pores can anchor platinum particles, inhibiting their agglomeration during the reaction and increasing catalyst stability.

6. Coke migration: The modified pore structure and acidity allow adsorbed species to be more mobile and easily migrate to the support, reducing carbon deposits on active metal sites.

These relationships imply that designing optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions should focus on creating hierarchical pore structures with a balance of smaller and larger pores. This approach can enhance metal dispersion, improve coke accommodation, facilitate reactant/product transport, and modify support acidity. The goal is to develop catalysts with better resistance to coke formation and improved stability, ultimately leading to higher propane conversion and longer catalyst lifetimes.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size and distribution: The introduction of hierarchical pores in ZQ resulted in a bimodal pore size distribution, with smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm). This diverse pore structure improved the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke and resist coking.

2. Connectivity and accessibility: The hierarchical pore structure enhanced mass transfer and diffusion within the catalyst, overcoming limitations often associated with microporous materials. This improved accessibility likely contributes to better catalytic performance.

3. Surface properties: The modified pore structure led to changes in surface properties, including decreased acid content. This alteration in surface chemistry played a role in improving the catalyst's coke accommodation capacity.

4. Stability: The presence of hierarchical pores in ZQ helped inhibit the agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, contributing to improved catalyst stability.

5. Coke accommodation: The modified pore structure significantly enhanced the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

These relationships suggest that designing catalysts with hierarchical pore structures, optimized pore size distributions, and modified surface properties can lead to more effective and stable catalysts for PDH reactions. The key is to balance the need for high surface area and active site accessibility with improved mass transfer and coke resistance. Future catalyst design should focus on tailoring these pore characteristics to maximize catalytic performance while minimizing deactivation due to coking.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The introduction of hierarchical pores in the ZQ catalyst support, as compared to the traditional ZSM-5 support, demonstrates several key effects:

1. Pore size and distribution: The ZQ support features two types of hierarchical pores - smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface. This hierarchical structure provides better diffusion and mass transfer properties compared to the purely microporous ZSM-5.

2. Coke accommodation: The hierarchical pore structure of ZQ enhances its capacity to accommodate coke. This is evidenced by the significantly lower amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5, particularly on the external surface of the support.

3. Coking resistance: The larger pore size distribution in ZQ supports leads to better resistance to coking during the reaction. This is attributed to improved diffusion and mass transfer properties, which help prevent coke accumulation.

4. Catalyst performance: The enhanced pore structure of ZQ results in better overall catalyst performance. The improved diffusion and mass transfer properties, coupled with better coke accommodation and resistance, contribute to higher propane conversion and increased catalyst stability.

These findings suggest that designing catalysts with hierarchical pore structures, combining both meso- and macropores, can significantly improve their performance in PDH reactions. Such structures can enhance mass transfer, reduce coke formation, and improve catalyst longevity. Future catalyst design should focus on optimizing the distribution and connectivity of these hierarchical pores to further enhance catalytic performance and stability in PDH reactions.

2. Connectivity and hierarchical arrangements: The presence of hierarchical pores, such as those in the ZQ sample, can enhance catalyst performance. The combination of smaller intracrystalline mesopores and larger surface mesopores/macropores creates a network that facilitates better transport of reactants and products.

3. Uniformity: Uniform pore size distribution helps in better dispersion of metallic particles, while a wide pore size distribution can lead to coke covering the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface.

4. Pore structure type: The change from a type I isotherm (typical for microporous materials) to a type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop indicates the presence of mesopores, which can improve catalyst performance.

These relationships have important implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts:

1. Incorporating hierarchical pore structures can enhance catalyst stability and performance by improving mass transfer and providing better coke accommodation.

2. Balancing micropores and mesopores can optimize both metal dispersion and reactant/product diffusion.

3. Tailoring pore size distribution can help control where coke forms, potentially extending catalyst lifetime.

4. Designing supports with larger pore sizes and uniform distributions can improve resistance to coking and enhance overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions.
