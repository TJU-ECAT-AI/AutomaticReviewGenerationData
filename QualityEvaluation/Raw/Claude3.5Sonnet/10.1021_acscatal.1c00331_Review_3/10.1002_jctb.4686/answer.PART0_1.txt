[1] "Zhang et al.21 compared different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for PtSn-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support were favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles. With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface."

[2] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."

[3] "As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 2080 nm. There are thus two kinds of hierarchical-pores appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals,28 accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ."

[4] "According to these effects, further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process is inhibited, leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. Moreover, by the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly. Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbonmetal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

[5] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size and distribution: A uniform pore size distribution with relatively large surface area favors the dispersion of metallic particles, which is beneficial for catalyst performance. Supports with wide pore size distribution allow coke to cover the external surface rather than the metallic surface.

2. Hierarchical pore arrangements: The introduction of hierarchical pores in ZQ zeolite improved the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke. Two types of hierarchical pores were observed: smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface.

3. Connectivity and accessibility: Hierarchical pore structures enhance the transport of reactants and products, improving catalytic activity and stability.

4. Influence on acidity: The introduction of hierarchical pores modified the acidity of the support material, which affects coke formation and migration.

5. Particle stabilization: Larger pores can anchor platinum particles, inhibiting their agglomeration during the reaction and increasing catalyst stability.

6. Coke migration: The modified pore structure and acidity allow adsorbed species to be more mobile and easily migrate to the support, reducing carbon deposits on active metal sites.

These relationships imply that designing optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions should focus on creating hierarchical pore structures with a balance of smaller and larger pores. This approach can enhance metal dispersion, improve coke accommodation, facilitate reactant/product transport, and modify support acidity. The goal is to develop catalysts with better resistance to coke formation and improved stability, ultimately leading to higher propane conversion and longer catalyst lifetimes.

催化剂支持体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：

1. 孔径和分布：均匀的孔径分布和较大的比表面积有利于金属颗粒的分散，这对催化剂性能有益。具有宽孔径分布的载体允许焦炭覆盖外表面而非金属表面。

2. 分级孔结构：在ZQ沸石中引入分级孔结构提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。观察到两种类型的分级孔：较小的晶内介孔（约3纳米）和表面上较大的介孔或大孔（20-80纳米）。

3. 连通性和可达性：分级孔结构增强了反应物和产物的传输，提高了催化活性和稳定性。

4. 对酸度的影响：分级孔的引入改变了载体材料的酸度，这影响焦炭的形成和迁移。

5. 颗粒稳定性：较大的孔可以锚定铂颗粒，抑制它们在反应过程中的团聚，增加催化剂的稳定性。

6. 焦炭迁移：改进的孔结构和酸度使吸附物种更容易移动并迁移到载体上，减少活性金属位点上的碳沉积。

这些关系意味着设计PDH反应的最佳和有效催化剂应该注重创造具有小孔和大孔平衡的分级孔结构。这种方法可以增强金属分散、改善焦炭容纳、促进反应物/产物传输，并修改载体酸度。目标是开发出具有更好的抗焦炭形成能力和改进稳定性的催化剂，最终导致更高的丙烷转化率和更长的催化剂寿命。
