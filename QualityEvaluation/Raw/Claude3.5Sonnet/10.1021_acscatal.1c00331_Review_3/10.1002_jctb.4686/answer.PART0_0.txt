[1] "With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface."

[2] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as an efficient support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Due to its large surface area coupled with the right channel properties, catalysts supported on ZSM-5 possess an enhanced capacity to accommodate coke."

[3] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."

[4] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."

[5] "Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, owing to the restriction of these hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the further agglomeration of platinum particles is inhibited during the reaction, which is advantage to the stability of the catalyst."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size distribution: A wide pore size distribution allows coke to cover the external surface of the support rather than the metallic surface, which helps maintain catalyst activity.

2. Surface area and channel properties: Large surface area and appropriate channel properties enhance the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke, as seen in ZSM-5 zeolite supports.

3. Hierarchical pore structures: The introduction of hierarchical pores in modified ZSM-5 (ZQ) changes the pore structure, decreases acid content, and promotes surface properties. These modifications greatly improve the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke.

4. Pore connectivity and uniformity: Although not explicitly mentioned, the improved performance of hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 (ZQ) suggests that better pore connectivity and uniformity contribute to enhanced coke accommodation and catalyst stability.

5. Restriction of metal particle agglomeration: Hierarchical pores in PtSnNa/ZQ inhibit the further agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, improving catalyst stability.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include:

1. Developing supports with hierarchical pore structures to enhance coke accommodation and catalyst stability.
2. Optimizing pore size distribution to direct coke formation away from active metal surfaces.
3. Balancing surface area and channel properties to maximize coke accommodation capacity.
4. Designing pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions.
5. Considering the interplay between pore structure and acid content to achieve desired catalytic performance.

These findings suggest that careful engineering of catalyst support pore structures can lead to improved PDH catalyst performance, longevity, and efficiency.

催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的影响显著：

1. 孔径分布：宽泛的孔径分布允许焦炭覆盖载体的外表面而非金属表面，有助于维持催化剂活性。

2. 表面积和通道特性：大表面积和适当的通道特性增强了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力，如ZSM-5分子筛载体所示。

3. 分级孔结构：在改性的ZSM-5（ZQ）中引入分级孔改变了孔结构，降低了酸含量，并促进了表面特性。这些修饰大大提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力。

4. 孔连通性和均匀性：尽管没有明确提及，但分级多孔ZSM-5（ZQ）的性能改善表明，更好的孔连通性和均匀性有助于提高焦炭容纳能力和催化剂稳定性。

5. 限制金属颗粒团聚：PtSnNa/ZQ中的分级孔抑制了反应过程中铂颗粒的进一步团聚，提高了催化剂稳定性。

这些发现对设计最佳和有效催化剂的启示包括：

1. 开发具有分级孔结构的载体，以增强焦炭容纳能力和催化剂稳定性。
2. 优化孔径分布，使焦炭形成远离活性金属表面。
3. 平衡表面积和通道特性，以最大化焦炭容纳能力。
4. 设计能够限制反应过程中金属颗粒团聚的孔结构。
5. 考虑孔结构与酸含量之间的相互作用，以实现所需的催化性能。

这些发现表明，通过精心设计催化剂载体的孔结构，可以提高PDH催化剂的性能、寿命和效率。
