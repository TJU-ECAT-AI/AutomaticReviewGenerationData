[1] "ZQ was synthesized by adding dimethyldiallyl ammonium acrylamide (PDD-AM) into the gel, which was the same as the precursor gel of ZSM-5."

[2] "The nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of different samples are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3(a), the parent HZSM-5 zeolite shows a I-type isotherm with a small N2 uptake at higher relative pressure, typical for a material microstructure without any mesopores. In contrast, the ZQ sample exhibits a type IV adsorptiondesorption isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop, which is usually associated with the filling and emptying of mesopores by capillary condensation."

[3] "As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 2080 nm. There are thus two kinds of hierarchical-pores appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals, accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ."

[4] "Also, according to results found by Gao's group, catalyst supports with large pore size distribution were found to be more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations. Thus ZQ supported catalyst ought to show better resistance to coking during the reaction."

[5] "The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke."

[6] "From Fig. 10, it can easily be seen that the total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The introduction of hierarchical pores in the ZQ catalyst support, as compared to the traditional ZSM-5 support, demonstrates several key effects:

1. Pore size and distribution: The ZQ support features two types of hierarchical pores - smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface. This hierarchical structure provides better diffusion and mass transfer properties compared to the purely microporous ZSM-5.

2. Coke accommodation: The hierarchical pore structure of ZQ enhances its capacity to accommodate coke. This is evidenced by the significantly lower amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5, particularly on the external surface of the support.

3. Coking resistance: The larger pore size distribution in ZQ supports leads to better resistance to coking during the reaction. This is attributed to improved diffusion and mass transfer properties, which help prevent coke accumulation.

4. Catalyst performance: The enhanced pore structure of ZQ results in better overall catalyst performance. The improved diffusion and mass transfer properties, coupled with better coke accommodation and resistance, contribute to higher propane conversion and increased catalyst stability.

These findings suggest that designing catalysts with hierarchical pore structures, combining both meso- and macropores, can significantly improve their performance in PDH reactions. Such structures can enhance mass transfer, reduce coke formation, and improve catalyst longevity. Future catalyst design should focus on optimizing the distribution and connectivity of these hierarchical pores to further enhance catalytic performance and stability in PDH reactions.

催化剂支持体孔结构的特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳能力和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。与传统的ZSM-5支持体相比，在ZQ催化剂支持体中引入层级孔结构展示了几个关键效果：

1. 孔径和分布：ZQ支持体具有两种类型的层级孔 - 较小的晶内介孔（约3纳米）和较大的表面介孔或大孔（20-80纳米）。这种层级结构与纯微孔的ZSM-5相比，提供了更好的扩散和物质传递性能。

2. 积碳容纳：ZQ的层级孔结构增强了其容纳积碳的能力。这一点从PtSnNa/ZQ上的积碳沉积量显著低于PtSnNa/ZSM-5上的积碳沉积量得到证实，特别是在支持体的外表面。

3. 抗积碳性：ZQ支持体中较大的孔径分布导致反应过程中具有更好的抗积碳性能。这归因于改善的扩散和物质传递性能，有助于防止积碳累积。

4. 催化剂性能：ZQ的增强孔结构导致更好的整体催化剂性能。改善的扩散和物质传递性能，加上更好的积碳容纳和抗性，共同促进了更高的丙烷转化率和增加的催化剂稳定性。

这些发现表明，设计具有层级孔结构（结合介孔和大孔）的催化剂可以显著提高其在PDH反应中的性能。这种结构可以增强物质传递，减少积碳形成，并提高催化剂的寿命。未来的催化剂设计应该关注优化这些层级孔的分布和连通性，以进一步提高PDH反应中的催化性能和稳定性。
