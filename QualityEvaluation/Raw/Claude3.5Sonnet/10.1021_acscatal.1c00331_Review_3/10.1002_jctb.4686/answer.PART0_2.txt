[1] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."

[2] "ZQ was synthesized by adding dimethyldiallyl ammonium acrylamide (PDD-AM) into the gel, which was the same as the precursor gel of ZSM-5."

[3] "As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 2080 nm. There are thus two kinds of hierarchical-pores appearing in the ZQ sample."

[4] "The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals, accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ."

[5] "According to results found by Gao's group, catalyst supports with large pore size distribution were found to be more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations. Thus ZQ supported catalyst ought to show better resistance to coking during the reaction."

[6] "Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, owing to the restriction of these hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the further agglomeration of platinum particles is inhibited during the reaction, which is advantage to the stability of the catalyst."

[7] "The hierarchical-pores of ZQ are responsible for the enhanced capacity of ZQ to accommodate coke."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size and distribution: The introduction of hierarchical pores in ZQ resulted in a bimodal pore size distribution, with smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm). This diverse pore structure improved the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke and resist coking.

2. Connectivity and accessibility: The hierarchical pore structure enhanced mass transfer and diffusion within the catalyst, overcoming limitations often associated with microporous materials. This improved accessibility likely contributes to better catalytic performance.

3. Surface properties: The modified pore structure led to changes in surface properties, including decreased acid content. This alteration in surface chemistry played a role in improving the catalyst's coke accommodation capacity.

4. Stability: The presence of hierarchical pores in ZQ helped inhibit the agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, contributing to improved catalyst stability.

5. Coke accommodation: The modified pore structure significantly enhanced the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

These relationships suggest that designing catalysts with hierarchical pore structures, optimized pore size distributions, and modified surface properties can lead to more effective and stable catalysts for PDH reactions. The key is to balance the need for high surface area and active site accessibility with improved mass transfer and coke resistance. Future catalyst design should focus on tailoring these pore characteristics to maximize catalytic performance while minimizing deactivation due to coking.

催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的影响显著：

1. 孔径和分布：在ZQ中引入的分级孔结构导致了双峰孔径分布，包括较小的晶内介孔（约3纳米）和较大的介孔或大孔（20-80纳米）。这种多样化的孔结构提高了催化剂容纳焦炭和抗焦炭的能力。

2. 连通性和可达性：分级孔结构增强了催化剂内部的传质和扩散，克服了微孔材料常见的局限性。这种改善的可达性可能有助于提高催化性能。

3. 表面性质：改进的孔结构导致表面性质的变化，包括酸含量的降低。这种表面化学性质的改变在提高催化剂焦炭容纳能力方面起到了作用。

4. 稳定性：ZQ中分级孔的存在有助于抑制反应过程中铂粒子的团聚，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。

5. 焦炭容纳：改进的孔结构显著提高了催化剂容纳焦炭的能力，这对于保持催化剂的长期性能至关重要。

这些关系表明，设计具有分级孔结构、优化孔径分布和改进表面性质的催化剂可以导致更有效和更稳定的PDH反应催化剂。关键是要平衡高比表面积和活性位点可达性的需求，同时改善传质和抗焦炭能力。未来的催化剂设计应着重于调整这些孔特性，以最大化催化性能，同时最小化由于焦炭沉积导致的失活。
