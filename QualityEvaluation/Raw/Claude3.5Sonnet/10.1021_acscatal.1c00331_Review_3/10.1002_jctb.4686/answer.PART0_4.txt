[1] "Zhang et al. compared different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for PtSn-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support were favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles."

[2] "With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface."

[3] "The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution of different samples are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3(a), the parent HZSM-5 zeolite shows a I-type isotherm with a small N2 uptake at higher relative pressure, typical for a material microstructure without any mesopores. In contrast, the ZQ sample exhibits a type IV adsorption–desorption isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop, which is usually associated with the filling and emptying of mesopores by capillary condensation."

[4] "As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 20–80 nm. There are thus two kinds of hierarchical-pores appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals, accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ."

[5] "According to results found by Gao's group, catalyst supports with large pore size distribution were found to be more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations. Thus ZQ supported catalyst ought to show better resistance to coking during the reaction."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: A relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles. Supports with larger pore sizes can better overcome diffusion and mass transfer limitations, leading to improved resistance to coking.

2. Connectivity and hierarchical arrangements: The presence of hierarchical pores, such as those in the ZQ sample, can enhance catalyst performance. The combination of smaller intracrystalline mesopores and larger surface mesopores/macropores creates a network that facilitates better transport of reactants and products.

3. Uniformity: Uniform pore size distribution helps in better dispersion of metallic particles, while a wide pore size distribution can lead to coke covering the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface.

4. Pore structure type: The change from a type I isotherm (typical for microporous materials) to a type IV isotherm with H1 hysteresis loop indicates the presence of mesopores, which can improve catalyst performance.

These relationships have important implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts:

1. Incorporating hierarchical pore structures can enhance catalyst stability and performance by improving mass transfer and providing better coke accommodation.

2. Balancing micropores and mesopores can optimize both metal dispersion and reactant/product diffusion.

3. Tailoring pore size distribution can help control where coke forms, potentially extending catalyst lifetime.

4. Designing supports with larger pore sizes and uniform distributions can improve resistance to coking and enhance overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

催化剂支持物的孔结构特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：

1. 孔径：相对较大的表面积和均匀的孔径分布有利于金属颗粒的分散。具有较大孔径的载体可以更好地克服扩散和传质限制，从而提高抗积碳能力。

2. 连通性和层次结构：存在层次孔结构（如ZQ样品中的结构）可以提高催化剂性能。较小的晶内介孔和较大的表面介孔/大孔的组合创造了一个网络，有利于反应物和产物的更好传输。

3. 均匀性：均匀的孔径分布有助于金属颗粒的更好分散，而宽泛的孔径分布可能导致积碳覆盖载体的外表面而非金属表面。

4. 孔结构类型：从I型等温线（微孔材料典型特征）到具有H1滞后环的IV型等温线的变化表明存在介孔，这可以改善催化剂性能。

这些关系对设计最优和有效的催化剂有重要影响：

1. 引入层次孔结构可以通过改善传质和提供更好的积碳容纳能力来提高催化剂的稳定性和性能。

2. 平衡微孔和介孔可以同时优化金属分散和反应物/产物扩散。

3. 定制孔径分布可以帮助控制积碳形成的位置，潜在地延长催化剂寿命。

4. 设计具有较大孔径和均匀分布的载体可以提高抗积碳能力，并增强PDH反应中的整体催化剂性能。
