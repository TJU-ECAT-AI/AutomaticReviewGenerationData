[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

The literature suggests that the characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

The use of a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous zeolite structure as a catalyst support has several advantages over traditional alumina supports. The unique structure of this zeolite, comprising ultrathin frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, enhances catalytic performance in two key ways:

1. Improved diffusion: The interconnected mesopores facilitate easier movement of reactants and products throughout the catalyst.

2. Higher metal dispersion: The porous structure allows for better dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores.

These structural characteristics help address some of the main challenges in PDH reactions, particularly coke formation and catalyst deactivation. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss how the pore structure affects coke accommodation, it's reasonable to infer that the improved diffusion and metal dispersion could help mitigate coke buildup and its negative effects on catalyst performance.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts are significant. Catalyst designers should focus on developing support materials with:

1. Hierarchical pore structures that combine micropores and mesopores
2. Three-dimensional pore connectivity
3. Thin framework walls
4. Uniform pore distribution

These features can potentially lead to catalysts with higher activity, better selectivity, and longer lifetimes by reducing coke formation and improving reactant/product diffusion. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationships between specific pore characteristics and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

文献表明，催化剂支撑体孔结构的特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳以及催化剂的整体性能有显著影响。

使用具有层级微孔/介孔结构的沸石作为催化剂支撑体比传统的氧化铝支撑体有几个优势。这种沸石的独特结构，包括超薄的框架和三维互连的介孔，通过以下两种关键方式增强了催化性能：

1. 改善扩散：互连的介孔促进了反应物和产物在催化剂中的更容易移动。

2. 更高的金属分散度：多孔结构允许金属纳米粒子在介孔中更好地分散。

这些结构特征有助于解决PDH反应中的一些主要挑战，特别是积碳形成和催化剂失活。虽然文献没有明确讨论孔结构如何影响积碳容纳，但可以合理推断，改善的扩散和金属分散可能有助于减轻积碳积累及其对催化剂性能的负面影响。

这对设计最佳和有效催化剂的影响是显著的。催化剂设计者应该专注于开发具有以下特征的支撑材料：

1. 结合微孔和介孔的层级孔结构
2. 三维孔连通性
3. 薄的框架壁
4. 均匀的孔分布

这些特征可能会通过减少积碳形成和改善反应物/产物扩散，潜在地导致具有更高活性、更好选择性和更长寿命的催化剂。然而，还需要进一步的研究来充分理解PDH反应中特定孔特征与催化剂性能之间的关系。
