Platinum is a much used catalyst that, in petrochemical processes, is often alloyed 
with other metals to improve catalytic activity, selectivity and longevity15. Such 
catalysts are usually prepared in the form of metallic nanoparticles supported on 
porous solids, and their production involves reducing metal precursor compounds 
under a H2 flow at high temperatures6. The method works well when using easily 
reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements 
through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical 
potential of rare-earth element oxides6. Here we use as support a mesoporous zeolite 
that has pore walls with surface framework defects (called silanol nests) and show 
that the zeolite enables alloy formation between Pt and rare-earth elements. We find 
that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species 
with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, 
making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt. High-resolution transmission electron 
microscopy and hydrogen chemisorption measurements indicate that the resultant 
bimetallic nanoparticles supported on the mesoporous zeolite are intermetallic 
compounds, which we find to be stable, highly active and selective catalysts for the 
propane dehydrogenation reaction. When used with late transition metals, the same 
preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large 
amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic 
activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petro-
chemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene 
production3. This process is currently attracting interest in the area of 
heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply 
from the shale gas revolution. The industrial PDH process has been 
using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly 
three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7. The Pt metal 
alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as 
a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also 
causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene. 
To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt 
nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms 
and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles. But coke deposition still 
occurs, and currently used PtSn/alumina catalysts still require frequent 
and cumbersome regeneration steps to restore their catalytic activity.
Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has 
focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/
mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. 
This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a 
structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced 
catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises 
ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected 
mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals 
by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal 
nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13. We incorporated 
La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt 
catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known 
for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the 
latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15. Whereas we expected that 
addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite 
catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our 
surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with 
the addition of La and Y. Investigation by atomic-resolution electron 
microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with 
Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite. Systematic 
exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by 
ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetal-
lic compounds with La.
Figure1 shows the structure of the PtY intermetallic compound 
nanoparticles formed on the mesoporous zeolite. Representative 
low-magnification high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmis-
sion electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig.1a, b) show metal 
nanoparticles about 3nm in diameter uniformly distributed over the 
zeolite support, with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)

measurements indicating that Pt and Y coexist in the same particle 
(Fig.1c). To determine the detailed atomic structure of the bimetallic 
nanoparticles, atomic-resolution (AR) HAADF-STEM images and the 
corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) images were taken along 
different zone axes, [100] and [110]. The AR-HAADF-STEM image taken 
along [100] displays a regular array of bright and dark regions, which 
correspond to two different types of atomic column aligned perpen-
dicularly to the image (Fig.1d). The image contrast can be confirmed 
by the line scan profile shown in Fig.1f. Considering the Z-contrast of 
the HAADF detector, the bright parts can be regarded as columns of 
heavy Pt atoms, whereas the dark parts are assigned to columns of 
relatively lighter Y atoms. As shown in the inset of Fig.1d, when pro-
jected along [100], every column of Y atoms is neighboured by eight 
columns of Pt. This ordered atomic arrangement is identical to the L12 
superlattice with an atomic composition of Pt3Y found in bulk metal 
alloys, except for the slight difference in the atomic distance due to 
nanocrystallinity. The Pt3Y L12 structure can be described as the replace-
ment of corner Pt atoms in the unit cell of face-centred cubic Pt metal 
with bulkier Y atoms. The inter-planar distances and angles shown in 
the AR-HAADF-STEM image are consistent with the Pt3Y L12 structure. 
The (010) and (001) reflection spots marked in yellow in the FFT image 
(Fig.1e) are characteristic of the L12 superlattice. The L12 arrangement 
of Pt and Y atoms can also be confirmed when viewed along the [110] 
zone axis (Fig.1g, h). On the basis of the STEM investigation, a structural 
model of the Pt3Y nanoparticle is proposed in Fig.1i. The same L12 super-
lattice structure was also observed in the case of PtLa nanoparticles 
supported on mesoporous zeolite. A detailed structural analysis of 
the Pt3La nanoparticle is provided in Extended Data Fig.1.
The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted 
by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either 
La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 
350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (seeMethods). However, 
the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles that exhib-
ited long catalytic lifetime critically depended on the zeolite synthesis 
procedures, even when the obtained zeolites were all siliceous and had 
similar mesoporosity. When the zeolite was prepared following a typical

synthesis procedure using sodium silicate, the impregnated REEs in the 
zeolite existed as oxide nanoparticles, without forming intermetallic 
alloy nanoparticles with Pt. The Pt nanoparticles in separation from the 
REEs exhibited an extremely short PDH catalytic lifetime, identical to 
that obtained without REE incorporation. Alternatively, when zeolites 
synthesized under a sodium-free condition were used, there was a small 
but distinct increase in the catalytic lifetime. Our curiosity about this 
phenomenon led us to carry out an AR-HAADF-STEM investigation of 
the PtREE/zeolite, in which we observed a tiny portion of supported 
nanoparticles existing in alloy forms. From this unexpected observa-
tion, we speculated that the PtREE alloy formation could occur by 
incorporating the REEs in the form of single atomic species with high 
chemical potential. Such single atomic REEs could be converted to 
metallic REEs with H2 more easily than bulk REE oxides. We further 
speculated that the formation of atomically dispersed REEs could be 
assisted by framework defect sites in the zeolite, where multiple silanol 
groups are adjacently positioned to form a cluster of silanol groups 
(silanol nest). In fact, silanol nests are often detected by Fourier trans-
form infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in mesoporous zeolite synthesized 
under sodium-free conditions. We believe that the silanol nests could 
stabilize the single atomic REE species by forming coordination bonds16. 
In that case, it would be possible to control the formation of PtREE 
alloy nanoparticles by the concentration of silanol nests in the zeolite.
With these assumptions, we intentionally generated silanol nests 
by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently 
removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid (seeMethods and 
Extended Data Figs.2, 3). Each of the degallated sites corresponded to 
a generated silanol nest. The increase in the silanol nest concentration 
in the zeolite was supported by FTIR measurements (Extended Data 
Fig.4). In accordance with our hypothesis, the REEs incorporated in this 
zeolite were indeed atomically dispersed, as shown in a video taken by 
AR-HAADF-STEM (see Supplementary Video1). In this video, the single 
atomic species of La exhibited rapid and random translational motions 
on the zeolite surface, which we interpret as a single atomic REE species 
hopping from one silanol nest to another. We believe that the atomistic 
diffusion enables the formation of PtREE intermetallic nanoparticles 
when the zeolite is heated under H2 at 700C after impregnation of the 
metal precursors. In fact, the PtREE/zeolite sample shown in Fig.1 
was prepared using a degallated zeolite containing a large number of 
silanol nest sites. The PtREE/zeolite showed formation of Pt3La and 
Pt3Y nanoparticles throughout the zeolite support. The Pt3La and Pt3Y 
nanoparticles generated in this manner exhibited a distinctive H2 sorp-
tion behaviour (see Extended Data Table1). The alloy nanoparticles 
chemisorbed 0.5 H atoms per total Pt in the sample in a fully reversible 
manner, given that all hydrogen completely desorbed upon evacuation 
for 1h at room temperature. Monometallic Pt nanoparticles, by con-
trast, chemisorbed 1.0 H atoms per total Pt, with 64% of this amount 
strongly and irreversibly bonded. This indicates that the electronic state 
of the intermetallic compound nanoparticles was markedly different 
from that of monometallic Pt, as further confirmed by X-ray absorption 
near-edge structure (XANES) analysis (see Extended Data Fig.5), which 
indicated a noticeable shift in edge energy and in the white-line region 
upon the formation of PtREE intermetallic compounds.
The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated 
zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH cata-
lytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as 
shown in Fig.2. The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using 
a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (seeMethods), and these 
harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina 
catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactiva-
tion within 1d. In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles 
supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa, where 
mz stands for mesoporous zeolite) showed a high initial propane con-
version of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent 
extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 
days of reaction. In a control using a catalyst with the same amounts 
of Pt and La supported on the mesoporous zeolite synthesized from 
sodium silicate (denoted as PtLa/mz), propane conversion was 22% 
initially and dropped very rapidly to below 5% within 1.5h. Even though 
both catalysts used zeolites with the same MFI framework structure 
and the same mesoporosity as the support (Extended Data Fig.6), 
their catalytic lifetimes differed by three orders of magnitude. The 
rapid deactivation behaviour of the PtLa/mz catalyst was similar to 
that of the monometallic Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous zeo-
lite (Pt/mz), consistent with the hydrogen chemisorption property of 
the PtLa/mz sample, indicating that the supported Pt existed entirely 
as monometallic nanoparticles and that no alloy with La was present 
(Extended Data Table1). These comparisons suggest that the differ-
ences in catalyst performance between PtLa/mz-deGa and PtLa/mz 
are largely due to formation of the intermetallic alloy. Nevertheless, 
it is worth noting that the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small 
amount of Ga (Si/Ga=598) even after the degallation, and that this may

participate in the catalytic function17,18. The effect of the remaining Ga 
was examined from the differences in PDH performance of mz-deGa, 
La/mz-deGa and Pt/mz-deGa, as shown in Extended Data Fig.7. A simple 
comparison of the catalytic result suggested that the Ga effect was not 
as dramatic as the alloying effect, but there are still possibilities of Ga 
acting somehow as a promotor to enhance the catalytic function and/
or the alloy formation in PtLa/mz-deGa. Moreover, in a similar manner 
to PtLa/mz-deGa, PtY/mz-deGa also exhibited high initial propane 
conversion and propylene selectivity, and slow catalyst deactivation. 
This appears to be attributable to the difference in atomic size and elec-
tron negativity. Because La has a larger atomic size and lower electron 
negativity than Y, the geometric and electronic properties of Pt were 
modified to a greater extent. As this result shows, zeolites can be an 
effective support for the development of PDH catalysts. In recent years, 
efficient conversion of propane to propylene was reported with PtZn 
and PtSn catalysts supported on zeolites1921. For industrial application 
of the zeolite-supported catalysts, it would be important to establish 
an efficient regeneration method, such as the oxychlorination pro-
cess employed for PtSn/alumina. However, the regenerability of these 
 
catalysts has not yet been fully demonstrated.
The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/
mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests 
that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles. This 
approach can be extended to produce other metal alloys composed of 
Pt-group metals and REEs, as suggested in the case of the PtCe inter-
metallic alloy nanoparticle catalyst shown in Fig.2 and Extended Data 
Fig.8. The silanol nests in the mesoporous zeolite can effectively acti-
vate the hard-to-reduce REEs (that is, REEs with low reduction potential) 
to overcome the energy hurdle by putting them into single atomic 
species, which facilitates the formation of alloy nanoparticles. For the 
PtLa and PtY bimetallic catalysts, the reduction potential of the REEs is 
so low that the role of silanol nests is decisive for the formation of the 
metal alloys. In many other transition metal elements with higher reduc-
tion potential (for example, Co, Fe and Zn), alloy formation is known 
to occur spontaneously when the incorporated metal precursors are 
heated under H2. But even in this case, the atomistic diffusivity of the 
activated species via silanol nests is expected to facilitate access of the 
transition metal elements to nearby Pt nanoparticles, on which these 
species are reduced to the metallic state by reacting with chemisorbed 
hydrogen. This process can promote metal incorporation into the Pt 
nanoparticle. In fact, the promoting effect has been confirmed in the 
case of PtCo bimetallic alloy catalysts for the preferential CO oxidation 
(PROX) reaction. The PtCo catalysts were prepared on two zeolite sup-
ports, mz and mz-deGa, and on an alumina support. All the resultant 
catalyst samples showed PtCo nanoparticles with randomly distributed 
Pt and Co atoms, but the Co/Pt atomic ratio was considerably different, 
increasing in the order of aluminamz<mz-deGa. The difference in 
the alloy composition resulted in a remarkable change in the catalytic 
performance for PROX in a H2-rich stream containing 1.4% CO (catalytic 
efficiency: PtCo/aluminaPtCo/mz<PtCo/mz-deGa; see Extended 
Data Fig.9). On the basis of these results, we believe that the use of the 
present mesoporous zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of 
not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based 
alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up 
new opportunities for catalytic applications.
