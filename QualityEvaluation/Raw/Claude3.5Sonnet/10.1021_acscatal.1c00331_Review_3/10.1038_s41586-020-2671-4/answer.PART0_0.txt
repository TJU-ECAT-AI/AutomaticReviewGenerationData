[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C"

[3] "The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles that exhibited long catalytic lifetime critically depended on the zeolite synthesis procedures, even when the obtained zeolites were all siliceous and had similar mesoporosity."

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Mesoporous zeolites with three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores improve catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion, as well as enabling high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the pores.

2. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of the siliceous MFI zeolite support plays a crucial role in enhancing catalyst performance compared to traditional alumina supports.

3. While the mesoporosity of zeolites is important, the synthesis procedure and resulting surface chemistry (e.g., presence of silanol nests) are critical for forming catalytically active intermetallic nanoparticles and achieving long catalytic lifetimes.

4. The pore structure influences metal incorporation and dispersion, which in turn affects catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.

The literature does not directly discuss coke formation or accommodation in relation to pore structure. However, the significantly improved catalyst lifetime of PtREE intermetallic nanoparticles on mesoporous zeolites suggests that the pore structure may play a role in mitigating coke-related deactivation.

These findings imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus not only on creating hierarchical pore structures with both micro- and mesoporosity but also on tailoring the surface chemistry of the support to enable the formation of stable, highly dispersed intermetallic nanoparticles. The combination of appropriate pore structure and surface chemistry can lead to catalysts with superior activity, selectivity, and longevity.

文献为丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化剂载体孔结构如何影响性能提供了一些见解：

1. 具有三维互连介孔的介孔沸石通过促进反应物和产物扩散以及在孔内实现高金属纳米粒子分散来提高催化性能。

2. 硅质MFI沸石载体的微孔/介孔层次结构在提高催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用，相比传统的氧化铝载体更为优越。

3. 虽然沸石的介孔结构很重要，但合成过程和由此产生的表面化学性质（例如硅醇巢的存在）对于形成具有催化活性的金属间化合物纳米粒子和实现长催化寿命至关重要。

4. 孔结构影响金属的掺入和分散，进而影响催化剂的稳定性和抗失活能力。

文献没有直接讨论焦炭形成或积聚与孔结构的关系。然而，介孔沸石上PtREE金属间化合物纳米粒子的催化寿命显著提高，表明孔结构可能在减轻焦炭相关失活方面发挥作用。

这些发现意味着设计最佳PDH催化剂不仅应关注创建具有微孔和介孔的层次孔结构，还应关注调整载体的表面化学性质，以实现稳定、高分散金属间化合物纳米粒子的形成。适当的孔结构和表面化学性质的组合可以产生具有优异活性、选择性和寿命的催化剂。
