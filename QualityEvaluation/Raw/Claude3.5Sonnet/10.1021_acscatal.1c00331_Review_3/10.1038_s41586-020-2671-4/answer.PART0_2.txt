[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C"

[3] "The bimetallic PtREE alloy catalysts are composed of 1wt% Pt and 1wt% REE. For comparison, PtSn/alumina and Pt/mz catalysts were also tested. The PDH reaction conditions were as follows: 50mg catalyst, weight hourly space velocity of 11h1 with a pure propane gas flow, and temperatureof580C."

The literature does not directly address how different characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about the mesoporous zeolite support used in the study.

The mesoporous zeolite support described has a unique structure with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. This structure is said to boost catalytic performance of supported metals in two ways:

1. It provides facile reactant and product diffusion.
2. It allows for high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

These characteristics likely contribute to improved catalyst performance in PDH reactions, though the specific effects on coke formation and accommodation are not explicitly discussed. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of the zeolite support is mentioned as a potential factor in improving catalyst performance compared to traditional alumina supports.

The study focuses more on the formation of PtREE intermetallic compounds on the mesoporous zeolite support and their superior catalytic performance in PDH reactions, rather than on the detailed effects of pore structure characteristics. To fully answer the question, further research specifically investigating the relationships between pore structure characteristics and coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions would be needed.

文献并没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于研究中使用的介孔沸石载体的相关信息。

所描述的介孔沸石载体具有独特的结构，包括超薄的沸石框架和三维互连的介孔。这种结构据说通过以下两种方式提高了负载金属的催化性能：

1. 它提供了反应物和产物的快速扩散。
2. 它允许在介孔内高度分散金属纳米粒子。

这些特征可能有助于提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能，尽管没有明确讨论对积炭形成和容纳的具体影响。沸石载体的分级微孔/介孔结构被提及为可能改善催化剂性能的因素，相比于传统的氧化铝载体。

该研究更多地关注了PtREE金属间化合物在介孔沸石载体上的形成及其在PDH反应中的优异催化性能，而不是孔结构特征的详细影响。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行进一步的研究，专门调查孔结构特征与PDH反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能之间的关系。
