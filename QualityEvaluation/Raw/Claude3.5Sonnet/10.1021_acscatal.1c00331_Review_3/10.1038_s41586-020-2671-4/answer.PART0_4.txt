[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support characteristics influence performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures in zeolites can enhance catalytic performance compared to traditional alumina supports. The combination of micropores and mesopores creates a unique structure that offers benefits for PDH reactions.

2. Three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores in the zeolite support improve catalytic performance in two key ways:
   a) They facilitate reactant and product diffusion, which can help prevent coke buildup and improve overall reaction efficiency.
   b) They allow for high metal nanoparticle dispersion, which increases the available catalytic surface area.

3. The ultrathin zeolite frameworks mentioned contribute to the overall performance by providing a large surface area for metal dispersion and catalytic reactions.

4. While not explicitly stated, the hierarchical pore structure likely helps mitigate coke formation and accumulation by providing more space for coke deposition without blocking active sites, and by facilitating the diffusion of coke precursors away from active sites.

5. The literature suggests that optimizing pore structure can lead to more durable catalysts with longer lifetimes, addressing one of the key challenges in PDH catalysis.

These findings imply that designing catalyst supports with carefully controlled hierarchical pore structures, combining micropores and interconnected mesopores, can significantly enhance catalyst performance and longevity in PDH reactions. Future catalyst design should focus on optimizing these structural characteristics to balance reactant/product diffusion, metal dispersion, and coke resistance.

文献为丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化剂载体特性如何影响性能提供了一些见解：

1. 沸石中的分级微孔/介孔结构可以增强催化性能，相比传统的氧化铝载体。微孔和介孔的组合创造了一种独特的结构，为PDH反应提供了益处。

2. 沸石载体中三维互连的介孔通过两种关键方式改善催化性能：
   a) 它们促进反应物和产物的扩散，这可以帮助防止焦炭积累并提高整体反应效率。
   b) 它们允许金属纳米颗粒高度分散，增加了可用的催化表面积。

3. 所提到的超薄沸石骨架通过提供大面积用于金属分散和催化反应，为整体性能做出贡献。

4. 虽然没有明确说明，但分级孔结构可能有助于减轻焦炭形成和积累，方法是为焦炭沉积提供更多空间而不阻塞活性位点，并通过促进焦炭前体物远离活性位点的扩散。

5. 文献表明，优化孔结构可以产生更耐用、寿命更长的催化剂，解决PDH催化中的一个关键挑战。

这些发现意味着设计具有精心控制的分级孔结构、结合微孔和互连介孔的催化剂载体，可以显著提高PDH反应中催化剂的性能和寿命。未来的催化剂设计应该集中在优化这些结构特征上，以平衡反应物/产物扩散、金属分散和抗焦炭性能。
