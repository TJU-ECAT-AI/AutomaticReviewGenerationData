[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C"

[3] "The formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles that exhibited long catalytic lifetime critically depended on the zeolite synthesis procedures, even when the obtained zeolites were all siliceous and had similar mesoporosity."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Mesoporous zeolites with three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores improve catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion, as well as enabling high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the pores.

2. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of the siliceous MFI zeolite support plays a crucial role in enhancing catalyst performance compared to traditional alumina supports.

3. While the mesoporosity of zeolites is important, the synthesis procedure and resulting surface chemistry (e.g., presence of silanol nests) are critical for forming catalytically active intermetallic nanoparticles and achieving long catalytic lifetimes.

4. The pore structure influences metal incorporation and dispersion, which in turn affects catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.

The literature does not directly discuss coke formation or accommodation in relation to pore structure. However, the significantly improved catalyst lifetime of PtREE intermetallic nanoparticles on mesoporous zeolites suggests that the pore structure may play a role in mitigating coke-related deactivation.

These findings imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus not only on creating hierarchical pore structures with both micro- and mesoporosity but also on tailoring the surface chemistry of the support to enable the formation of stable, highly dispersed intermetallic nanoparticles. The combination of appropriate pore structure and surface chemistry can lead to catalysts with superior activity, selectivity, and longevity.

文献为丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化剂载体孔结构如何影响性能提供了一些见解：

1. 具有三维互连介孔的介孔沸石通过促进反应物和产物扩散以及在孔内实现高金属纳米粒子分散来提高催化性能。

2. 硅质MFI沸石载体的微孔/介孔层次结构在提高催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用，相比传统的氧化铝载体更为优越。

3. 虽然沸石的介孔结构很重要，但合成过程和由此产生的表面化学性质（例如硅醇巢的存在）对于形成具有催化活性的金属间化合物纳米粒子和实现长催化寿命至关重要。

4. 孔结构影响金属的掺入和分散，进而影响催化剂的稳定性和抗失活能力。

文献没有直接讨论焦炭形成或积聚与孔结构的关系。然而，介孔沸石上PtREE金属间化合物纳米粒子的催化寿命显著提高，表明孔结构可能在减轻焦炭相关失活方面发挥作用。

这些发现意味着设计最佳PDH催化剂不仅应关注创建具有微孔和介孔的层次孔结构，还应关注调整载体的表面化学性质，以实现稳定、高分散金属间化合物纳米粒子的形成。适当的孔结构和表面化学性质的组合可以产生具有优异活性、选择性和寿命的催化剂。

The literature suggests that the characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

The use of a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous zeolite structure as a catalyst support has several advantages over traditional alumina supports. The unique structure of this zeolite, comprising ultrathin frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores, enhances catalytic performance in two key ways:

1. Improved diffusion: The interconnected mesopores facilitate easier movement of reactants and products throughout the catalyst.

2. Higher metal dispersion: The porous structure allows for better dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores.

These structural characteristics help address some of the main challenges in PDH reactions, particularly coke formation and catalyst deactivation. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss how the pore structure affects coke accommodation, it's reasonable to infer that the improved diffusion and metal dispersion could help mitigate coke buildup and its negative effects on catalyst performance.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts are significant. Catalyst designers should focus on developing support materials with:

1. Hierarchical pore structures that combine micropores and mesopores
2. Three-dimensional pore connectivity
3. Thin framework walls
4. Uniform pore distribution

These features can potentially lead to catalysts with higher activity, better selectivity, and longer lifetimes by reducing coke formation and improving reactant/product diffusion. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationships between specific pore characteristics and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

文献表明，催化剂支撑体孔结构的特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳以及催化剂的整体性能有显著影响。

使用具有层级微孔/介孔结构的沸石作为催化剂支撑体比传统的氧化铝支撑体有几个优势。这种沸石的独特结构，包括超薄的框架和三维互连的介孔，通过以下两种关键方式增强了催化性能：

1. 改善扩散：互连的介孔促进了反应物和产物在催化剂中的更容易移动。

2. 更高的金属分散度：多孔结构允许金属纳米粒子在介孔中更好地分散。

这些结构特征有助于解决PDH反应中的一些主要挑战，特别是积碳形成和催化剂失活。虽然文献没有明确讨论孔结构如何影响积碳容纳，但可以合理推断，改善的扩散和金属分散可能有助于减轻积碳积累及其对催化剂性能的负面影响。

这对设计最佳和有效催化剂的影响是显著的。催化剂设计者应该专注于开发具有以下特征的支撑材料：

1. 结合微孔和介孔的层级孔结构
2. 三维孔连通性
3. 薄的框架壁
4. 均匀的孔分布

这些特征可能会通过减少积碳形成和改善反应物/产物扩散，潜在地导致具有更高活性、更好选择性和更长寿命的催化剂。然而，还需要进一步的研究来充分理解PDH反应中特定孔特征与催化剂性能之间的关系。

The literature does not directly address how different characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about the mesoporous zeolite support used in the study.

The mesoporous zeolite support described has a unique structure with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. This structure is said to boost catalytic performance of supported metals in two ways:

1. It provides facile reactant and product diffusion.
2. It allows for high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

These characteristics likely contribute to improved catalyst performance in PDH reactions, though the specific effects on coke formation and accommodation are not explicitly discussed. The hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure of the zeolite support is mentioned as a potential factor in improving catalyst performance compared to traditional alumina supports.

The study focuses more on the formation of PtREE intermetallic compounds on the mesoporous zeolite support and their superior catalytic performance in PDH reactions, rather than on the detailed effects of pore structure characteristics. To fully answer the question, further research specifically investigating the relationships between pore structure characteristics and coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions would be needed.

文献并没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于研究中使用的介孔沸石载体的相关信息。

所描述的介孔沸石载体具有独特的结构，包括超薄的沸石框架和三维互连的介孔。这种结构据说通过以下两种方式提高了负载金属的催化性能：

1. 它提供了反应物和产物的快速扩散。
2. 它允许在介孔内高度分散金属纳米粒子。

这些特征可能有助于提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能，尽管没有明确讨论对积炭形成和容纳的具体影响。沸石载体的分级微孔/介孔结构被提及为可能改善催化剂性能的因素，相比于传统的氧化铝载体。

该研究更多地关注了PtREE金属间化合物在介孔沸石载体上的形成及其在PDH反应中的优异催化性能，而不是孔结构特征的详细影响。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行进一步的研究，专门调查孔结构特征与PDH反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能之间的关系。

[2] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles. But coke deposition still occurs, and currently used PtSn/alumina catalysts still require frequent and cumbersome regeneration steps to restore their catalytic activity."

The literature provides insights into how catalyst support characteristics influence performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore structure and connectivity: The mesoporous zeolite support with three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores enhances catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion. This improved mass transfer likely reduces coke formation and improves overall catalyst effectiveness.

2. Hierarchical arrangements: The zeolite support features a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure, which combines the benefits of both micropores and mesopores. This arrangement likely provides a balance between high surface area for active site dispersion and improved mass transfer properties.

3. Metal dispersion: The mesoporous structure enables high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the pores, which can lead to improved catalyst utilization and potentially reduced coke formation.

4. Support composition: The shift from alumina to siliceous MFI zeolite as a support material suggests that the chemical nature of the support also plays a role in catalyst performance and durability.

5. Coke formation mitigation: While not directly related to pore structure, the addition of Sn to Pt nanoparticles demonstrates an approach to reducing coke formation by diluting the Pt surface and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles.

These relationships imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus on creating hierarchical pore structures with interconnected mesopores to balance diffusion and active site accessibility. Additionally, tailoring the support's chemical composition and incorporating appropriate metal combinations can further enhance catalyst performance and longevity by mitigating coke formation.

4. 载体组成：从氧化铝转向硅质MFI沸石作为载体材料表明，载体的化学性质也在催化剂性能和耐久性方面发挥作用。

5. 积碳形成缓解：虽然与孔结构没有直接关系，但向Pt纳米粒子中添加Sn展示了通过稀释Pt表面和破坏生成积碳的Pt集合体来减少积碳形成的方法。

这些关系意味着，设计最佳PDH催化剂应该关注创建具有互连介孔的分级孔结构，以平衡扩散和活性位点可及性。此外，调整载体的化学组成和结合适当的金属组合可以通过缓解积碳形成来进一步提高催化剂性能和寿命。
