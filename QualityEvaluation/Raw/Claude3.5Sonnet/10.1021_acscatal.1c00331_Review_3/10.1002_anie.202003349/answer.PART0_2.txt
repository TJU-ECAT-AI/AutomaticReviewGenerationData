[1] "Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs."

[2] "N2 adsorption-desorption analyses show a slight decrease in microporous volume (ca. 0.015cm3g1) due to the partially occupied metal species in some void spaces of the zeolites, but sufficient microporous volumes (>0.09cm3g1) and areas (>229m2g1) are observed in metal-containing samples"

[3] "The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H"

[4] "TEM images showed that most of the cokes were located on the outer surfaces of the zeolites"

The literature does not directly address how different aspects of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, some insights can be inferred:

1. The ordered microporous structure of zeolites provides thermal stability and helps anchor small metal nanoparticles, which is beneficial for catalyst performance.

2. The microporous nature of the zeolite support helps confine metal species and maintain their small size, which is crucial for catalytic activity and stability.

3. Despite significant coke formation (14.4%) after prolonged reaction time, the microporous volume only decreased by less than 10%. This suggests that the microporous structure of the zeolite helps resist pore blockage by coke.

4. Most coke deposits were observed on the outer surfaces of the zeolites, implying that the microporous structure may help prevent coke formation inside the pores.

These observations suggest that the microporous structure of zeolites plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst performance by:
- Providing stability to metal nanoparticles
- Resisting pore blockage by coke
- Potentially limiting internal coke formation

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements influence these factors. Further research would be needed to fully understand the relationships between these pore characteristics and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

虽然文献没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同方面如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能，但可以推断出一些见解：

1. 沸石的有序微孔结构提供了热稳定性，有助于固定小型金属纳米粒子，这对催化剂性能有利。

2. 沸石载体的微孔性质有助于限制金属物种并保持其小尺寸，这对催化活性和稳定性至关重要。

3. 尽管在长时间反应后形成了大量积碳（14.4%），但微孔体积仅减少了不到10%。这表明沸石的微孔结构有助于抵抗积碳引起的孔道堵塞。

4. 大部分积碳沉积物被观察到在沸石的外表面，这意味着微孔结构可能有助于防止孔内积碳形成。

这些观察结果表明，沸石的微孔结构在维持催化剂性能方面起着关键作用，通过：
- 为金属纳米粒子提供稳定性
- 抵抗积碳引起的孔道堵塞
- 可能限制内部积碳形成

然而，文献并未提供有关孔径、连通性、均匀性或分层排列如何影响这些因素的具体信息。还需要进一步的研究才能充分理解这些孔特征与PDH反应中催化剂性能之间的关系。
