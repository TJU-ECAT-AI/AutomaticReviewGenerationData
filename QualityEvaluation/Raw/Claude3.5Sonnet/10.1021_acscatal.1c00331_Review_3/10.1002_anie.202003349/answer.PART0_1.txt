[1] "Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs."

[2] "N2 adsorption-desorption analyses show a slight decrease in microporous volume (ca. 0.015cm3g1) due to the partially occupied metal species in some void spaces of the zeolites, but sufficient microporous volumes (>0.09cm3g1) and areas (>229m2g1) are observed in metal-containing samples"

[3] "The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H"

[4] "TEM images showed that most of the cokes were located on the outer surfaces of the zeolites"

The literature does not directly address how different aspects of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, some insights can be inferred from the information provided:

1. The ordered microporous structure of zeolites contributes to their effectiveness as catalyst supports, helping to anchor small metal nanoparticles.

2. The microporous nature of the zeolite support helps maintain catalyst performance even with significant coke deposition. Despite 14.4% coke content after extended use, the microporous volume only decreased by less than 10%.

3. The zeolite pore structure appears to influence the location of coke formation, with most coke depositing on the outer surfaces rather than within the pores. This suggests that the microporous structure may help protect active sites within the zeolite from coke deposition.

4. The maintenance of sufficient microporous volume and surface area even after metal species occupation suggests that the pore structure plays a role in accommodating both active metal species and reaction products/byproducts.

While these observations provide some insights, the document does not offer a comprehensive analysis of how specific pore characteristics (e.g., pore size, connectivity, uniformity, hierarchical arrangements) influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. Further research would be needed to fully address the question and provide specific guidance for designing optimal catalysts based on pore structure characteristics.

虽然文献没有直接讨论催化剂支撑体孔结构的不同方面如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和整体催化剂性能，但可以从提供的信息中推断出一些见解：

1. 沸石的有序微孔结构有助于其作为催化剂支撑体的有效性，有助于固定小金属纳米颗粒。

2. 沸石支撑体的微孔性质有助于在大量积碳沉积的情况下保持催化剂性能。尽管长期使用后积碳含量达到14.4%，但微孔体积仅减少不到10%。

3. 沸石孔结构似乎影响积碳形成的位置，大部分积碳沉积在外表面而不是孔内。这表明微孔结构可能有助于保护沸石内部的活性位点免受积碳沉积的影响。

4. 即使在金属物种占据后仍保持足够的微孔体积和表面积，这表明孔结构在容纳活性金属物种和反应产物/副产物方面发挥作用。

虽然这些观察提供了一些见解，但该文档并没有对特定的孔特征（如孔径、连通性、均匀性、层次结构）如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能进行全面分析。需要进一步研究才能充分解答这个问题，并基于孔结构特征为设计最佳催化剂提供具体指导。
