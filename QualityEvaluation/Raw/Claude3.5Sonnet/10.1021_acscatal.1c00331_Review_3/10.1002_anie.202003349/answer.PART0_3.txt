The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how different catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, some insights can be inferred:

1. Zeolites with ordered microporous structures are considered ideal supports for anchoring small metal nanoparticles, suggesting that well-defined pore structures can help stabilize catalytic species.

2. The importance of exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species indicates that pore structure plays a crucial role in catalyst performance and longevity.

3. Despite significant coke formation (14.4%) after extended use, the microporous volume of the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst decreased by less than 10%. This suggests that the microporous structure of the zeolite support helps resist pore blockage from coke deposition.

4. The observation that most coke was located on the outer surfaces of the zeolites implies that the internal pore structure may help prevent extensive internal coking, preserving catalyst activity.

These findings suggest that well-designed pore structures, particularly those with ordered micropores, can enhance catalyst stability, resist pore blockage, and potentially improve overall performance in PDH reactions. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationships between specific pore characteristics and catalyst behavior.

虽然文献没有全面分析不同催化剂载体孔结构如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能，但可以推断出一些见解：

1. 具有有序微孔结构的沸石被认为是锚定小金属纳米颗粒的理想载体，这表明明确定义的孔结构可以帮助稳定催化物种。

2. 探索更好的载体来稳定Pt物种的重要性表明，孔结构在催化剂性能和寿命中起着关键作用。

3. 尽管长期使用后形成了大量积碳（14.4%），但PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂的微孔体积减少不到10%。这表明沸石载体的微孔结构有助于抵抗积碳沉积造成的孔阻塞。

4. 观察到大部分积碳位于沸石的外表面，这意味着内部孔结构可能有助于防止大量内部积碳，从而保持催化剂活性。

这些发现表明，精心设计的孔结构，特别是具有有序微孔的结构，可以增强催化剂稳定性，抵抗孔阻塞，并可能提高PDH反应的整体性能。然而，还需要更多研究来充分理解特定孔特征与催化剂行为之间的关系。
