[1] "Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs."

[2] "N2 adsorption-desorption analyses show a slight decrease in microporous volume (ca. 0.015cm3g1) due to the partially occupied metal species in some void spaces of the zeolites, but sufficient microporous volumes (>0.09cm3g1) and areas (>229m2g1) are observed in metal-containing samples"

[3] "TG-DTA analyses demonstrated that after 400min on stream, the weight losses of coke deposition over spent Pt/Al2O3 and PtZn4/Al2O3 were 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively, which were much higher than those of Pt@S-1-H (2.5%) and PtZn4@S-1-H (1.5%) even after 1200min on stream"

[4] "The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H"

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Zeolites with ordered microporous structures are considered ideal supports for anchoring small metal nanoparticles due to their thermal stability and ability to confine particles.

2. The microporous nature of zeolites helps limit coke formation. Compared to Al2O3 supports, zeolite-supported catalysts showed significantly less coke deposition over longer reaction times.

3. Even with substantial coke content (14.4%) after extended reaction time, the zeolite catalyst maintained most of its microporous volume, with less than 10% decrease. This suggests the pore structure can accommodate coke while preserving catalyst performance.

4. Most coke was found on the outer surfaces of zeolites, indicating that the internal pore structure may help prevent extensive internal coking.

5. The ordered microporous structure of zeolites appears to contribute to better catalyst stability and longevity compared to traditional Al2O3 supports.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements, it suggests that the confined space and ordered structure of zeolite micropores play a crucial role in limiting coke formation and preserving catalyst performance. This implies that designing catalysts with optimized pore structures could further enhance their effectiveness and longevity in PDH reactions.

该文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂载体孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的见解：

1. 由于沸石具有有序的微孔结构和出色的热稳定性，被认为是固定小型金属纳米粒子的理想载体。

2. 沸石的微孔性质有助于限制焦炭形成。与Al2O3载体相比，沸石负载的催化剂在更长的反应时间内显示出明显更少的焦炭沉积。

3. 即使在长时间反应后焦炭含量高达14.4%，沸石催化剂仍保持了大部分微孔体积，减少不到10%。这表明孔结构可以容纳焦炭，同时保持催化剂性能。

4. 大部分焦炭被发现在沸石的外表面，表明内部孔结构可能有助于防止大量内部结焦。

5. 与传统的Al2O3载体相比，沸石的有序微孔结构似乎有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

虽然文献没有明确讨论孔连通性、均匀性或层次结构，但它表明沸石微孔的受限空间和有序结构在限制焦炭形成和保持催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。这意味着设计具有优化孔结构的催化剂可能进一步提高它们在PDH反应中的有效性和寿命。

The literature does not directly address how different aspects of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, some insights can be inferred from the information provided:

1. The ordered microporous structure of zeolites contributes to their effectiveness as catalyst supports, helping to anchor small metal nanoparticles.

2. The microporous nature of the zeolite support helps maintain catalyst performance even with significant coke deposition. Despite 14.4% coke content after extended use, the microporous volume only decreased by less than 10%.

3. The zeolite pore structure appears to influence the location of coke formation, with most coke depositing on the outer surfaces rather than within the pores. This suggests that the microporous structure may help protect active sites within the zeolite from coke deposition.

4. The maintenance of sufficient microporous volume and surface area even after metal species occupation suggests that the pore structure plays a role in accommodating both active metal species and reaction products/byproducts.

While these observations provide some insights, the document does not offer a comprehensive analysis of how specific pore characteristics (e.g., pore size, connectivity, uniformity, hierarchical arrangements) influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. Further research would be needed to fully address the question and provide specific guidance for designing optimal catalysts based on pore structure characteristics.

虽然文献没有直接讨论催化剂支撑体孔结构的不同方面如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和整体催化剂性能，但可以从提供的信息中推断出一些见解：

1. 沸石的有序微孔结构有助于其作为催化剂支撑体的有效性，有助于固定小金属纳米颗粒。

2. 沸石支撑体的微孔性质有助于在大量积碳沉积的情况下保持催化剂性能。尽管长期使用后积碳含量达到14.4%，但微孔体积仅减少不到10%。

3. 沸石孔结构似乎影响积碳形成的位置，大部分积碳沉积在外表面而不是孔内。这表明微孔结构可能有助于保护沸石内部的活性位点免受积碳沉积的影响。

4. 即使在金属物种占据后仍保持足够的微孔体积和表面积，这表明孔结构在容纳活性金属物种和反应产物/副产物方面发挥作用。

虽然这些观察提供了一些见解，但该文档并没有对特定的孔特征（如孔径、连通性、均匀性、层次结构）如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能进行全面分析。需要进一步研究才能充分解答这个问题，并基于孔结构特征为设计最佳催化剂提供具体指导。

The literature does not directly address how different aspects of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, some insights can be inferred:

1. The ordered microporous structure of zeolites provides thermal stability and helps anchor small metal nanoparticles, which is beneficial for catalyst performance.

2. The microporous nature of the zeolite support helps confine metal species and maintain their small size, which is crucial for catalytic activity and stability.

3. Despite significant coke formation (14.4%) after prolonged reaction time, the microporous volume only decreased by less than 10%. This suggests that the microporous structure of the zeolite helps resist pore blockage by coke.

4. Most coke deposits were observed on the outer surfaces of the zeolites, implying that the microporous structure may help prevent coke formation inside the pores.

These observations suggest that the microporous structure of zeolites plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst performance by:
- Providing stability to metal nanoparticles
- Resisting pore blockage by coke
- Potentially limiting internal coke formation

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements influence these factors. Further research would be needed to fully understand the relationships between these pore characteristics and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

1. Zeolites with ordered microporous structures are considered ideal supports for anchoring small metal nanoparticles, suggesting that well-defined pore structures can help stabilize catalytic species.

2. The importance of exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species indicates that pore structure plays a crucial role in catalyst performance and longevity.

3. Despite significant coke formation (14.4%) after extended use, the microporous volume of the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst decreased by less than 10%. This suggests that the microporous structure of the zeolite support helps resist pore blockage from coke deposition.

The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions:

1. Zeolites with ordered microporous structures are considered ideal supports for anchoring small metal nanoparticles due to their thermal stability and ability to confine particles.

2. The use of zeolite supports leads to significantly less coke deposition compared to traditional Al2O3 supports. Zeolite-supported catalysts showed much lower coke content even after longer reaction times.

3. Most coke formation occurs on the outer surfaces of zeolite crystals rather than within the pores. This suggests that the microporous structure helps prevent internal coke buildup.

4. Even with substantial coke formation (14.4%) after extended reaction time, the microporous volume only decreased by less than 10%, indicating good coke accommodation without severe pore blockage.

5. The confinement effect of zeolite pores helps prevent metal particle sintering and migration, which contributes to improved catalyst stability.

These findings imply that the uniform microporous structure of zeolites, with their ability to confine metal particles and accommodate coke mainly on external surfaces, leads to improved catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports. The pore structure plays a crucial role in limiting internal coke formation and maintaining accessibility to active sites. Designing catalysts with optimized pore structures that balance confinement effects with accessibility could further enhance PDH catalyst performance.

文献为催化剂支撑结构如何影响PDH反应中的积炭形成和催化剂性能提供了一些见解：

1. 由于其热稳定性和限制粒子的能力，具有有序微孔结构的沸石被认为是锚定小金属纳米粒子的理想支撑材料。

2. 与传统的Al2O3支撑相比，使用沸石支撑会导致显著减少积炭沉积。即使在更长的反应时间后，沸石支撑的催化剂也显示出更低的积炭含量。

3. 大部分积炭形成发生在沸石晶体的外表面，而不是孔内。这表明微孔结构有助于防止内部积炭堆积。

4. 即使在延长反应时间后形成大量积炭（14.4%），微孔体积仅减少不到10%，表明良好的积炭容纳能力，而不会严重堵塞孔道。

5. 沸石孔的限制效应有助于防止金属粒子烧结和迁移，从而提高催化剂稳定性。

这些发现意味着，与传统支撑相比，沸石的均匀微孔结构能够限制金属粒子并主要在外表面容纳积炭，从而在PDH反应中提高催化剂性能和稳定性。孔结构在限制内部积炭形成和保持活性位点可及性方面起着至关重要的作用。设计具有优化孔结构的催化剂，平衡限制效应和可及性，可以进一步增强PDH催化剂的性能。
