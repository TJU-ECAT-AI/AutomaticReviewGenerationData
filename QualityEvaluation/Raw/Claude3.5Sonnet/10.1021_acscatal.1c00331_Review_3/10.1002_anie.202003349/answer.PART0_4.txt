The literature provides some insights into how catalyst support structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions:

1. Zeolites with ordered microporous structures are considered ideal supports for anchoring small metal nanoparticles due to their thermal stability and ability to confine particles.

2. The use of zeolite supports leads to significantly less coke deposition compared to traditional Al2O3 supports. Zeolite-supported catalysts showed much lower coke content even after longer reaction times.

3. Most coke formation occurs on the outer surfaces of zeolite crystals rather than within the pores. This suggests that the microporous structure helps prevent internal coke buildup.

4. Even with substantial coke formation (14.4%) after extended reaction time, the microporous volume only decreased by less than 10%, indicating good coke accommodation without severe pore blockage.

5. The confinement effect of zeolite pores helps prevent metal particle sintering and migration, which contributes to improved catalyst stability.

These findings imply that the uniform microporous structure of zeolites, with their ability to confine metal particles and accommodate coke mainly on external surfaces, leads to improved catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports. The pore structure plays a crucial role in limiting internal coke formation and maintaining accessibility to active sites. Designing catalysts with optimized pore structures that balance confinement effects with accessibility could further enhance PDH catalyst performance.

文献为催化剂支撑结构如何影响PDH反应中的积炭形成和催化剂性能提供了一些见解：

1. 由于其热稳定性和限制粒子的能力，具有有序微孔结构的沸石被认为是锚定小金属纳米粒子的理想支撑材料。

2. 与传统的Al2O3支撑相比，使用沸石支撑会导致显著减少积炭沉积。即使在更长的反应时间后，沸石支撑的催化剂也显示出更低的积炭含量。

3. 大部分积炭形成发生在沸石晶体的外表面，而不是孔内。这表明微孔结构有助于防止内部积炭堆积。

4. 即使在延长反应时间后形成大量积炭（14.4%），微孔体积仅减少不到10%，表明良好的积炭容纳能力，而不会严重堵塞孔道。

5. 沸石孔的限制效应有助于防止金属粒子烧结和迁移，从而提高催化剂稳定性。

这些发现意味着，与传统支撑相比，沸石的均匀微孔结构能够限制金属粒子并主要在外表面容纳积炭，从而在PDH反应中提高催化剂性能和稳定性。孔结构在限制内部积炭形成和保持活性位点可及性方面起着至关重要的作用。设计具有优化孔结构的催化剂，平衡限制效应和可及性，可以进一步增强PDH催化剂的性能。
