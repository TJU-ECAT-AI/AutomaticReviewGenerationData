[1] "Taking advantage of the confinement effect of zeolite structures, subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters with a few atoms) can be generated and stabilized in the porous structures within zeolite crystallites"

[2] "It will be shown that subtle changes in the structural features of the subnanometric PtSn clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional spectroscopic techniques, can drastically affect their performance for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C"

[4] "Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites."

The literature does not directly address how different characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some insights can be inferred:

1. Confinement effect: The zeolite structure provides a confinement effect that allows generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species (single atoms and small clusters) within the porous structures. This suggests that pore size and uniformity are important factors in controlling catalyst particle size and dispersion.

2. Channel structure: The literature mentions that Pt clusters are located in the 10R sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite. This specific channel structure likely plays a role in controlling catalyst dispersion and accessibility.

3. Coke formation and accommodation: The study notes that while coke formation occurs at the metal surface, the carbonaceous species do not directly block the active sites. This suggests that the pore structure may influence how coke is accommodated without severely impacting catalyst performance.

4. Subtle structural changes: The research emphasizes that subtle changes in the structural features of subnanometric PtSn clusters can drastically affect their performance in propane dehydrogenation. This implies that precise control over pore structure and metal-support interactions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance.

While the literature does not provide comprehensive information on how various pore characteristics influence PDH catalyst performance, it does highlight the importance of controlled nanoconfinement and specific channel structures in designing effective catalysts. Further research focusing on systematic variation of pore characteristics could provide more detailed insights into their impact on coke formation, metal dispersion, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

虽然文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能，但可以推断出一些见解：

1. 限域效应：沸石结构提供了一种限域效应，允许在多孔结构内生成和稳定亚纳米金属物种（单原子和小簇）。这表明孔径和均一性是控制催化剂粒子大小和分散度的重要因素。

2. 通道结构：文献提到Pt簇位于MFI沸石的10元环正弦通道中。这种特定的通道结构可能在控制催化剂分散和可及性方面发挥作用。

3. 积碳形成和容纳：研究指出，虽然积碳形成发生在金属表面，但碳质物种并不直接阻塞活性位点。这表明孔结构可能影响积碳的容纳方式，而不会严重影响催化剂性能。

4. 微妙的结构变化：研究强调，亚纳米PtSn簇的结构特征的细微变化可能会极大地影响其在丙烷脱氢中的性能。这意味着精确控制孔结构和金属-载体相互作用对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

尽管文献没有提供关于各种孔特征如何影响PDH催化剂性能的全面信息，但它确实强调了控制纳米限域和特定通道结构在设计有效催化剂方面的重要性。针对孔特征系统变化的进一步研究可能会提供更详细的见解，说明它们对PDH反应中积碳形成、金属分散和整体催化剂性能的影响。
