[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts in numerous industrial processes due to their excellent properties for the activation of CH bonds while limiting the extent of CC bond cleavage through hydrogenolysis"

[2] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[3] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High Sn content and high activation temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions"

[4] "Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites."

The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The study focuses on subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6 nm) located in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure and cluster size are key to achieving optimal catalytic performance. 

The formation of alloyed structures, promoted by high Sn content and high activation temperature, enhances catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions. This suggests that the pore structure of the MFI zeolite allows for the formation of these beneficial alloyed structures.

While coke formation occurs on the metal surface, the carbonaceous species do not seem to directly block the active sites. This implies that the pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating coke without significantly impacting catalyst performance.

These findings suggest that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite, particularly its 10R sinusoidal channels, contributes to the catalyst's performance by:
1. Allowing the formation of optimally-sized PtSn clusters
2. Enabling the formation of beneficial alloyed structures
3. Potentially accommodating coke formation without severely impacting active sites

However, the study does not provide direct comparisons with other pore structures or explicitly discuss the influence of pore characteristics on coke formation and accommodation. Further research would be needed to fully understand these relationships and their implications for designing optimal PDH catalysts.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

研究聚焦于位于纯硅MFI沸石的正弦形10元环通道中的亚纳米级PtSn簇（0.5-0.6 nm）。这种特定的孔结构和簇大小是实现最佳催化性能的关键。

高Sn含量和高活化温度促进合金结构的形成，这种结构能提高催化剂在脱氢反应中的选择性和稳定性。这表明MFI沸石的孔结构允许形成这些有益的合金结构。

虽然积碳发生在金属表面，但碳质物似乎并不直接阻塞活性位点。这意味着MFI沸石的孔结构可能在容纳积碳的同时不会显著影响催化剂性能。

这些发现表明，MFI沸石的独特孔结构，特别是其10元环正弦形通道，通过以下方式contributes到催化剂的性能：
1. 允许形成最佳大小的PtSn簇
2. 使有益的合金结构能够形成
3. 潜在地容纳积碳形成而不严重影响活性位点

然而，该研究并未直接比较其他孔结构，也没有明确讨论孔特征对积碳形成和容纳的影响。需要进行进一步的研究以充分理解这些关系及其对设计最佳PDH催化剂的影响。
