          [1] "Taking advantage of the confinement effect of zeolite structures, subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters with a few atoms) can be generated and stabilized in the porous structures within zeolite crystallites"

[2] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[3] "Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites."

[4] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates"

[5] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst"

          While the literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it provides several relevant insights:

1. Pore size and confinement: The zeolite structure's confinement effect allows for the generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species within the porous structures. This suggests that pore size and uniformity play a crucial role in controlling catalyst particle size and distribution.

2. Specific pore structure: The study focuses on subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6 nm) located in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure appears to be beneficial for catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Coke formation and accommodation: While coke formation occurs on the metal surface, the carbonaceous species do not directly block the active sites in this catalyst system. This suggests that the pore structure may influence how coke is accommodated without severely impacting catalyst activity.

4. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between Pt and Sn in the confined spaces of the zeolite is key to suppressing coke formation. Even minimal interaction between the two metals can significantly reduce coke deposition, as long as the active species remain small and subnanometric.

5. Catalyst lifetime: Extended catalyst lifetimes are associated with less coke deposition on PtSn clusters. This implies that the pore structure, in combination with the bimetallic nature of the clusters, helps minimize coke formation and improve catalyst longevity.

These findings suggest that well-defined, uniform pore structures like those in MFI zeolite can help control metal cluster size, distribute active sites, and potentially mitigate the negative impacts of coke formation. However, the study does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different pore structures or explicitly discuss the impact of pore connectivity or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

          虽然文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能，但它提供了几个相关的见解：

1. 孔径和限域效应：沸石结构的限域效应允许在多孔结构内生成和稳定亚纳米级金属物种。这表明孔径大小和均匀性在控制催化剂粒子大小和分布方面起着关键作用。

2. 特定孔结构：该研究关注的是位于MFI沸石正弦10R通道中的亚纳米PtSn簇（0.5-0.6 nm）。这种特定的孔结构似乎有利于丙烷脱氢的催化剂性能。

3. 积碳形成和容纳：虽然积碳发生在金属表面，但在这种催化剂系统中，碳质物种并不直接阻塞活性位点。这表明孔结构可能影响积碳的容纳方式，而不会严重影响催化剂活性。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：沸石限域空间中Pt和Sn之间的相互作用是抑制积碳形成的关键。只要活性物种保持小型和亚纳米级，即使两种金属之间的相互作用最小，也能显著减少积碳沉积。

5. 催化剂寿命：延长的催化剂寿命与PtSn簇上较少的积碳沉积有关。这意味着孔结构结合双金属簇的性质，有助于最小化积碳形成并改善催化剂寿命。

这些发现表明，像MFI沸石这样定义良好、均匀的孔结构可以帮助控制金属簇大小，分布活性位点，并可能减轻积碳形成的负面影响。然而，该研究并没有对不同的孔结构进行全面比较，也没有明确讨论孔连通性或分层排列对PDH反应中催化剂性能的影响。
