[1] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[2] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst."

[3] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates."

The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The study focuses on subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6 nm) located in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure appears to play a crucial role in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

The interaction between Pt and Sn in these confined spaces is key to suppressing coke formation. Even minimal interaction between the two metals can significantly reduce coke deposition, as long as the active species remain small and subnanometric.

Longer reduction times (12-22 hours) led to extended catalyst lifetimes, which was associated with less coke deposition on the PtSn clusters. This suggests that the pore structure, combined with the appropriate preparation method, can influence coke formation and overall catalyst performance.

While the study doesn't explicitly compare different pore structures, it implies that the confined space of the 10R channels in MFI zeolite is beneficial for maintaining small, stable PtSn clusters that resist coking. This suggests that pore size, connectivity, and uniformity can play important roles in catalyst design for PDH reactions.

虽然文献没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成和催化剂性能，但它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

研究重点关注位于MFI沸石的正弦形10R通道中的亚纳米级PtSn簇(0.5-0.6 nm)。这种特定的孔结构似乎在实现最佳催化性能方面起着关键作用。

在这些受限空间中Pt和Sn之间的相互作用对抑制积炭形成至关重要。只要活性物种保持小型和亚纳米级，即使两种金属之间的相互作用最小，也能显著减少积炭沉积。

更长的还原时间(12-22小时)导致催化剂寿命延长，这与PtSn簇上的积炭沉积减少有关。这表明孔结构，结合适当的制备方法，可以影响积炭形成和整体催化剂性能。

虽然研究没有明确比较不同的孔结构，但它暗示MFI沸石中10R通道的受限空间有利于维持小型、稳定的PtSn簇，这些簇能够抵抗积炭。这表明孔径大小、连通性和均匀性在PDH反应的催化剂设计中可以发挥重要作用。
