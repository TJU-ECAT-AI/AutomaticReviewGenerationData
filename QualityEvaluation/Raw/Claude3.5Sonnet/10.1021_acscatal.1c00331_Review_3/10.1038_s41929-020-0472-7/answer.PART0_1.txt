[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts in numerous industrial processes due to their excellent properties for the activation of CH bonds while limiting the extent of CC bond cleavage through hydrogenolysis"

[2] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[3] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High Sn content and high activation temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions"

[4] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst"

The literature does not directly address how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The study focuses on subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6 nm) located in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure and cluster size are key to achieving optimal catalytic performance. 

The formation of bimetallic PtSn clusters within the confined space of the zeolite channels appears to play a crucial role in suppressing coke formation. The interaction between Pt and Sn, even if minimal, is sufficient to reduce coking, as long as the active species remain small (subnanometric) throughout the catalyst's lifetime.

While the study doesn't explicitly compare different pore structures, it suggests that the confinement of small bimetallic clusters within narrow zeolite channels can lead to improved catalyst stability and performance in PDH reactions. This implies that pore size, connectivity, and uniformity are important factors in designing effective PDH catalysts, as they can influence the formation and stability of active metal clusters.

The research indicates that optimizing the interaction between metals (like Pt and Sn) within a confined pore structure is more critical for catalyst performance than focusing solely on pore characteristics. However, the pore structure must be suitable to accommodate and stabilize these small bimetallic clusters.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂支撑孔结构的具体特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能。但是，它提供了一些相关的见解：

研究重点关注位于纯硅MFI沸石正弦10R通道中的亚纳米级PtSn簇(0.5-0.6 nm)。这种特定的孔结构和簇大小是实现最佳催化性能的关键。

在沸石通道的受限空间内形成双金属PtSn簇似乎在抑制积碳形成方面起着关键作用。只要活性物种在催化剂的整个使用寿命中保持较小(亚纳米级)，即使是最小的Pt和Sn之间的相互作用也足以减少积碳。

虽然该研究没有明确比较不同的孔结构，但它表明，将小型双金属簇限制在窄小的沸石通道内可以提高PDH反应中催化剂的稳定性和性能。这意味着孔径、连通性和均匀性是设计有效PDH催化剂的重要因素，因为它们可以影响活性金属簇的形成和稳定性。

研究表明，优化受限孔结构内金属(如Pt和Sn)之间的相互作用对催化剂性能的影响比单纯关注孔特征更为关键。然而，孔结构必须适合容纳和稳定这些小型双金属簇。
