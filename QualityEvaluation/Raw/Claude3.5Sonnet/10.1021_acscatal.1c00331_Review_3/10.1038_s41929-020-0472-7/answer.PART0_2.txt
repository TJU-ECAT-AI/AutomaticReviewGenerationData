The literature does not directly address how different aspects of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

1. The confinement effect of zeolite structures allows for the generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species within the porous structures. This suggests that pore size and uniformity play a role in controlling catalyst particle size and distribution.

2. The study focuses on subnanometric Pt clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure seems to be beneficial for catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation.

3. While coke formation occurs on the metal surface, the carbonaceous species do not directly block the active sites in this catalyst system. This suggests that the pore structure may influence how coke is accommodated without severely impacting catalyst activity.

4. Extended catalyst lifetimes are associated with less coke deposition on PtSn clusters. This implies that the pore structure, in combination with the bimetallic nature of the clusters, helps minimize coke formation and improve catalyst longevity.

These findings suggest that well-defined, uniform pore structures like those in MFI zeolite can help control metal cluster size, distribute active sites, and potentially mitigate the negative impacts of coke formation. However, the study does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different pore structures or explicitly discuss the impact of pore connectivity or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

该文献并没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同方面如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能。但是，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

1. 沸石结构的限域效应允许在多孔结构内生成和稳定亚纳米级金属物种。这表明孔径大小和均匀性在控制催化剂粒子大小和分布方面起着作用。

2. 该研究关注的是限制在MFI沸石正弦10R通道中的亚纳米Pt簇。这种特定的孔结构似乎有利于丙烷脱氢的催化剂性能。

3. 虽然积碳发生在金属表面，但在这种催化剂系统中，碳质物种并不直接阻塞活性位点。这表明孔结构可能影响积碳的容纳方式，而不会严重影响催化剂活性。

4. 延长的催化剂寿命与PtSn簇上较少的积碳沉积有关。这意味着孔结构结合双金属簇的性质，有助于最小化积碳形成并改善催化剂寿命。

这些发现表明，像MFI沸石这样定义良好、均匀的孔结构可以帮助控制金属簇大小，分布活性位点，并可能减轻积碳形成的负面影响。然而，该研究并没有对不同的孔结构进行全面比较，也没有明确讨论孔连通性或分层排列对PDH反应中催化剂性能的影响。
