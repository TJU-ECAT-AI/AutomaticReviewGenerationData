[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts in numerous industrial processes due to their excellent properties for the activation of CH bonds while limiting the extent of CC bond cleavage through hydrogenolysis"

[2] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[3] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High Sn content and high activation temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions"

The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The study focuses on subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6 nm) located in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure and cluster size are key to achieving optimal catalytic performance. 

The formation of alloyed structures, promoted by high Sn content and high activation temperature, enhances catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions. This suggests that the pore structure of the MFI zeolite allows for the formation of these beneficial alloyed structures.

While coke formation occurs on the metal surface, the carbonaceous species do not seem to directly block the active sites. This implies that the pore structure of the MFI zeolite may play a role in accommodating coke without significantly impacting catalyst performance.

These findings suggest that the unique pore structure of the MFI zeolite, particularly its 10R sinusoidal channels, contributes to the catalyst's performance by:
1. Allowing the formation of optimally-sized PtSn clusters
2. Enabling the formation of beneficial alloyed structures
3. Potentially accommodating coke formation without severely impacting active sites

However, the study does not provide direct comparisons with other pore structures or explicitly discuss the influence of pore characteristics on coke formation and accommodation. Further research would be needed to fully understand these relationships and their implications for designing optimal PDH catalysts.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

研究聚焦于位于纯硅MFI沸石的正弦形10元环通道中的亚纳米级PtSn簇（0.5-0.6 nm）。这种特定的孔结构和簇大小是实现最佳催化性能的关键。

高Sn含量和高活化温度促进合金结构的形成，这种结构能提高催化剂在脱氢反应中的选择性和稳定性。这表明MFI沸石的孔结构允许形成这些有益的合金结构。

虽然积碳发生在金属表面，但碳质物似乎并不直接阻塞活性位点。这意味着MFI沸石的孔结构可能在容纳积碳的同时不会显著影响催化剂性能。

这些发现表明，MFI沸石的独特孔结构，特别是其10元环正弦形通道，通过以下方式contributes到催化剂的性能：
1. 允许形成最佳大小的PtSn簇
2. 使有益的合金结构能够形成
3. 潜在地容纳积碳形成而不严重影响活性位点

然而，该研究并未直接比较其他孔结构，也没有明确讨论孔特征对积碳形成和容纳的影响。需要进行进一步的研究以充分理解这些关系及其对设计最佳PDH催化剂的影响。

The study focuses on subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.5-0.6 nm) located in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure and cluster size are key to achieving optimal catalytic performance. 

The formation of bimetallic PtSn clusters within the confined space of the zeolite channels appears to play a crucial role in suppressing coke formation. The interaction between Pt and Sn, even if minimal, is sufficient to reduce coking, as long as the active species remain small (subnanometric) throughout the catalyst's lifetime.

While the study doesn't explicitly compare different pore structures, it suggests that the confinement of small bimetallic clusters within narrow zeolite channels can lead to improved catalyst stability and performance in PDH reactions. This implies that pore size, connectivity, and uniformity are important factors in designing effective PDH catalysts, as they can influence the formation and stability of active metal clusters.

The research indicates that optimizing the interaction between metals (like Pt and Sn) within a confined pore structure is more critical for catalyst performance than focusing solely on pore characteristics. However, the pore structure must be suitable to accommodate and stabilize these small bimetallic clusters.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂支撑孔结构的具体特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能。但是，它提供了一些相关的见解：

研究重点关注位于纯硅MFI沸石正弦10R通道中的亚纳米级PtSn簇(0.5-0.6 nm)。这种特定的孔结构和簇大小是实现最佳催化性能的关键。

在沸石通道的受限空间内形成双金属PtSn簇似乎在抑制积碳形成方面起着关键作用。只要活性物种在催化剂的整个使用寿命中保持较小(亚纳米级)，即使是最小的Pt和Sn之间的相互作用也足以减少积碳。

虽然该研究没有明确比较不同的孔结构，但它表明，将小型双金属簇限制在窄小的沸石通道内可以提高PDH反应中催化剂的稳定性和性能。这意味着孔径、连通性和均匀性是设计有效PDH催化剂的重要因素，因为它们可以影响活性金属簇的形成和稳定性。

研究表明，优化受限孔结构内金属(如Pt和Sn)之间的相互作用对催化剂性能的影响比单纯关注孔特征更为关键。然而，孔结构必须适合容纳和稳定这些小型双金属簇。

The literature does not directly address how different aspects of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

1. The confinement effect of zeolite structures allows for the generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species within the porous structures. This suggests that pore size and uniformity play a role in controlling catalyst particle size and distribution.

2. The study focuses on subnanometric Pt clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite. This specific pore structure seems to be beneficial for catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation.

3. While coke formation occurs on the metal surface, the carbonaceous species do not directly block the active sites in this catalyst system. This suggests that the pore structure may influence how coke is accommodated without severely impacting catalyst activity.

4. Extended catalyst lifetimes are associated with less coke deposition on PtSn clusters. This implies that the pore structure, in combination with the bimetallic nature of the clusters, helps minimize coke formation and improve catalyst longevity.

These findings suggest that well-defined, uniform pore structures like those in MFI zeolite can help control metal cluster size, distribute active sites, and potentially mitigate the negative impacts of coke formation. However, the study does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different pore structures or explicitly discuss the impact of pore connectivity or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

该文献并没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同方面如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能。但是，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

1. 沸石结构的限域效应允许在多孔结构内生成和稳定亚纳米级金属物种。这表明孔径大小和均匀性在控制催化剂粒子大小和分布方面起着作用。

2. 该研究关注的是限制在MFI沸石正弦10R通道中的亚纳米Pt簇。这种特定的孔结构似乎有利于丙烷脱氢的催化剂性能。

3. 虽然积碳发生在金属表面，但在这种催化剂系统中，碳质物种并不直接阻塞活性位点。这表明孔结构可能影响积碳的容纳方式，而不会严重影响催化剂活性。

4. 延长的催化剂寿命与PtSn簇上较少的积碳沉积有关。这意味着孔结构结合双金属簇的性质，有助于最小化积碳形成并改善催化剂寿命。

这些发现表明，像MFI沸石这样定义良好、均匀的孔结构可以帮助控制金属簇大小，分布活性位点，并可能减轻积碳形成的负面影响。然而，该研究并没有对不同的孔结构进行全面比较，也没有明确讨论孔连通性或分层排列对PDH反应中催化剂性能的影响。

The interaction between Pt and Sn in these confined spaces is key to suppressing coke formation. Even minimal interaction between the two metals can significantly reduce coke deposition, as long as the active species remain small and subnanometric.

Longer reduction times (12-22 hours) led to extended catalyst lifetimes, which was associated with less coke deposition on the PtSn clusters. This suggests that the pore structure, combined with the appropriate preparation method, can influence coke formation and overall catalyst performance.

While the study doesn't explicitly compare different pore structures, it implies that the confined space of the 10R channels in MFI zeolite is beneficial for maintaining small, stable PtSn clusters that resist coking. This suggests that pore size, connectivity, and uniformity can play important roles in catalyst design for PDH reactions.

在这些受限空间中Pt和Sn之间的相互作用对抑制积炭形成至关重要。只要活性物种保持小型和亚纳米级，即使两种金属之间的相互作用最小，也能显著减少积炭沉积。

更长的还原时间(12-22小时)导致催化剂寿命延长，这与PtSn簇上的积炭沉积减少有关。这表明孔结构，结合适当的制备方法，可以影响积炭形成和整体催化剂性能。

虽然研究没有明确比较不同的孔结构，但它暗示MFI沸石中10R通道的受限空间有利于维持小型、稳定的PtSn簇，这些簇能够抵抗积炭。这表明孔径大小、连通性和均匀性在PDH反应的催化剂设计中可以发挥重要作用。

The literature does not directly address how different characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some insights can be inferred:

1. Confinement effect: The zeolite structure provides a confinement effect that allows generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species (single atoms and small clusters) within the porous structures. This suggests that pore size and uniformity are important factors in controlling catalyst particle size and dispersion.

2. Channel structure: The literature mentions that Pt clusters are located in the 10R sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite. This specific channel structure likely plays a role in controlling catalyst dispersion and accessibility.

3. Coke formation and accommodation: The study notes that while coke formation occurs at the metal surface, the carbonaceous species do not directly block the active sites. This suggests that the pore structure may influence how coke is accommodated without severely impacting catalyst performance.

4. Subtle structural changes: The research emphasizes that subtle changes in the structural features of subnanometric PtSn clusters can drastically affect their performance in propane dehydrogenation. This implies that precise control over pore structure and metal-support interactions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance.

While the literature does not provide comprehensive information on how various pore characteristics influence PDH catalyst performance, it does highlight the importance of controlled nanoconfinement and specific channel structures in designing effective catalysts. Further research focusing on systematic variation of pore characteristics could provide more detailed insights into their impact on coke formation, metal dispersion, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions.
