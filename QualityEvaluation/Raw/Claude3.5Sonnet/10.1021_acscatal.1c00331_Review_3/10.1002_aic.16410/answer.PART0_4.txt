The pore network structure of catalyst supports has a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key characteristics that impact these processes include:

1. Pore size: The model uses a log-normal distribution of pore radii, which affects diffusion rates and coke accumulation. Smaller pores are more likely to become blocked by coke, while larger pores can accommodate more coke before deactivation.

2. Connectivity: The model uses a fixed pore connectivity (Z) for all inner nodes. Higher connectivity can improve diffusion and potentially delay deactivation by providing alternative pathways when some pores become blocked.

3. Uniformity: The random assignment of pore radii introduces non-uniformity, which can lead to localized coke formation and non-uniform deactivation across the catalyst particle.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: While not explicitly mentioned, the combination of different pore sizes and connectivity can create hierarchical structures that influence coke distribution and catalyst performance.

These characteristics affect the capacity to contain coke, the distribution of coke within the catalyst particle, and the relationship between coke content and apparent reaction rate. The pore network structure impacts diffusion limitations, pore blockage, and the accessibility of active sites, all of which contribute to the overall catalyst performance and deactivation process.

For designing optimal and effective catalysts, these relationships imply that:

1. A balanced pore size distribution is crucial, with larger pores to accommodate coke and smaller pores to maintain high surface area.

2. Higher pore connectivity can improve catalyst longevity by providing alternative diffusion pathways.

3. Controlled non-uniformity might be beneficial in creating preferential coke deposition zones away from critical active sites.

4. Hierarchical pore structures could be designed to optimize both coke accommodation and reactant/product diffusion.

5. Tailoring the pore network structure can potentially increase the catalyst's capacity to contain coke without severe performance loss.

By considering these factors in catalyst design, it may be possible to create more coke-resistant and longer-lasting catalysts for PDH reactions, improving overall process efficiency and economics.

催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳能力和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。影响这些过程的关键特征包括：

1. 孔径：模型使用对数正态分布的孔径，这影响扩散速率和积碳累积。较小的孔更容易被积碳堵塞，而较大的孔在失活前可以容纳更多积碳。

2. 连通性：模型对所有内部节点使用固定的孔连通性(Z)。较高的连通性可以改善扩散，并可能通过在某些孔被堵塞时提供替代路径来延迟失活。

3. 均匀性：孔径的随机分配引入了非均匀性，这可能导致局部积碳形成和催化剂颗粒上的非均匀失活。

4. 分级排列：虽然没有明确提及，但不同孔径和连通性的组合可以创建影响积碳分布和催化剂性能的分级结构。

这些特征影响了容纳积碳的能力、催化剂颗粒内的积碳分布以及积碳含量与表观反应速率之间的关系。孔网络结构影响扩散限制、孔堵塞和活性位点的可及性，所有这些都影响着整体催化剂性能和失活过程。

对于设计最佳和有效的催化剂，这些关系意味着：

1. 平衡的孔径分布至关重要，大孔用于容纳积碳，小孔用于保持高比表面积。

2. 较高的孔连通性可以通过提供替代扩散路径来提高催化剂寿命。

3. 受控的非均匀性可能有利于在远离关键活性位点的区域创建优先积碳沉积区。

4. 分级孔结构可以设计成同时优化积碳容纳和反应物/产物扩散。

5. 调整孔网络结构可能增加催化剂在不严重损失性能的情况下容纳积碳的能力。

通过在催化剂设计中考虑这些因素，有可能创造出更耐积碳和更持久的PDH反应催化剂，从而提高整体过程效率和经济性。
