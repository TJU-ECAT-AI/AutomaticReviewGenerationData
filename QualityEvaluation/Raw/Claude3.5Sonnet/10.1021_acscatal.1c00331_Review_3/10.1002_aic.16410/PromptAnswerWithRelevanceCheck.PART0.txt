The pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors include:

1. Pore size: The model uses a log-normal distribution of pore radii, which affects diffusion, reaction rates, and coke deposition. Smaller pores are more prone to blockage, while larger pores can accommodate more coke.

2. Connectivity: The model uses a simplified approach with uniform connectivity for inner nodes. Higher connectivity generally improves mass transfer and coke distribution, potentially enhancing catalyst longevity.

3. Uniformity: The random assignment of pore radii introduces non-uniformity, which can lead to preferential coke deposition and localized deactivation.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: While not explicitly mentioned, the model's ability to represent complex pore networks suggests that hierarchical structures could be studied, potentially revealing benefits of multi-scale porosity.

These relationships imply that optimal catalyst design should focus on:

1. Balancing pore sizes to maximize coke accommodation while maintaining sufficient diffusion rates.
2. Enhancing pore connectivity to improve mass transfer and coke distribution.
3. Controlling pore size uniformity to prevent localized deactivation.
4. Exploring hierarchical pore structures to optimize both reaction and coke accommodation processes.

The pore network model provides a powerful tool for understanding these complex relationships and guiding the design of more effective PDH catalysts with improved coke resistance and longevity.

The literature indicates that various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore network structure: This has a major impact on the catalyst's capacity to contain coke. The arrangement and connectivity of pores affect how coke accumulates and distributes throughout the catalyst particle.

2. Pore size: As coke forms, it narrows pores and eventually plugs them. Larger pores may take longer to become fully blocked, potentially allowing for greater coke accommodation before significant deactivation occurs.

3. Connectivity: The interconnectedness of pores affects how coke formation in one area impacts other regions of the catalyst. Higher connectivity may help maintain access to active sites even as some pores become blocked.

4. Uniformity vs. hierarchical arrangements: Non-uniform pore structures, such as those with a hierarchical arrangement of pore sizes, may be beneficial. Larger pores could serve as "highways" for reactant transport, while smaller pores provide high surface area for reactions.

5. Percolation effects: When the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, a percolation phenomenon occurs, leading to a sudden disconnection of the pore network. This can cause a dramatic change in catalyst performance.

These relationships have several implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts:

1. Tailoring pore size distribution: A carefully designed distribution of pore sizes could balance coke accommodation capacity with maintenance of active site accessibility.

2. Optimizing connectivity: Higher pore connectivity could improve catalyst longevity by maintaining reactant access to active sites even as some pores become blocked.

3. Incorporating hierarchical structures: Catalysts with hierarchical pore structures might better balance reactant transport and surface area requirements.

4. Considering percolation thresholds: Catalyst designs should aim to delay reaching the percolation threshold, perhaps by incorporating more robust transport pathways that are less susceptible to blockage.

5. Balancing competing factors: Optimal catalyst design must balance coke accommodation capacity, maintenance of active site accessibility, and overall reaction performance.

In conclusion, understanding and manipulating these pore structure characteristics can lead to the development of more coke-resistant and longer-lasting catalysts for PDH reactions, potentially improving process efficiency and reducing the frequency of catalyst regeneration or replacement.

1. 孔网络结构：这对催化剂容纳积碳的能力有重大影响。孔的排列和连通性影响积碳在催化剂颗粒中的累积和分布方式。

2. 孔径：随着积碳形成，孔径变窄并最终堵塞。较大的孔可能需要更长时间才能完全堵塞，这可能允许在显著失活之前容纳更多积碳。

3. 连通性：孔的互连性影响一个区域的积碳形成如何影响催化剂的其他区域。更高的连通性可能有助于在某些孔被堵塞的情况下仍然保持对活性位点的访问。

4. 均匀性vs层级排列：非均匀的孔结构，如具有层级孔径排列的结构，可能是有益的。较大的孔可以作为反应物输送的"高速公路"，而较小的孔提供高表面积用于反应。

5. 渗流效应：当开放孔的比例降至临界阈值以下时，会发生渗流现象，导致孔网络突然断开。这可能导致催化剂性能的显著变化。

这些关系对设计最优和有效的催化剂有几个启示：

1. 定制孔径分布：精心设计的孔径分布可以平衡积碳容纳能力和保持活性位点可访问性。

2. 优化连通性：更高的孔连通性可以通过在某些孔被堵塞的情况下仍然保持反应物对活性位点的访问，从而提高催化剂的寿命。

3. 纳入层级结构：具有层级孔结构的催化剂可能更好地平衡反应物传输和表面积要求。

4. 考虑渗流阈值：催化剂设计应该旨在延迟达到渗流阈值，可能通过纳入更具鲁棒性的传输路径，这些路径不太容易被堵塞。

5. 平衡竞争因素：最佳催化剂设计必须平衡积碳容纳能力、保持活性位点可访问性和整体反应性能。

总之，理解和操纵这些孔结构特征可以导致开发出更耐积碳和更长寿命的PDH反应催化剂，可能提高过程效率并减少催化剂再生或更换的频率。

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The pore network structure affects the capacity to contain coke and plays a crucial role in the coking and deactivation processes.

Pore size: Larger pores can accommodate more coke before becoming completely blocked, but they may also allow for faster coke formation due to easier access of reactants. Smaller pores may limit coke formation but are more susceptible to complete blockage.

Connectivity: Higher pore connectivity can potentially maintain catalyst activity for longer periods by providing alternative pathways for reactants and products when some pores become blocked. However, it may also facilitate coke spread throughout the particle.

Uniformity: Non-uniform pore structures can lead to uneven coke distribution, with some areas becoming heavily coked while others remain relatively clean. This can result in inefficient catalyst utilization.

Hierarchical arrangements: A hierarchical pore structure with both macro- and micropores could potentially balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion. Macropores can serve as "highways" for reactant transport, while micropores provide high surface area for the reaction.

As coking progresses, it narrows and eventually plugs pores, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process not only covers active sites but also increases diffusion resistance and can make some active sites inaccessible, particularly when large pores become surrounded by plugged pores.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include:

1. Developing pore structures that balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion.
2. Creating robust pore networks that maintain connectivity even as some pores become blocked.
3. Designing catalyst particles with hierarchical pore structures to optimize both reaction and mass transfer.
4. Considering the distribution of active sites within the pore network to maximize catalyst utilization.
5. Engineering pore structures that promote more uniform coke deposition to extend catalyst lifetime.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for creating catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation and can maintain high performance over longer periods in PDH reactions.

催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。孔网络结构影响了容纳积碳的能力，并在积碳和失活过程中起着关键作用。

孔径：较大的孔可以在完全堵塞之前容纳更多的积碳，但也可能由于反应物更容易进入而导致更快的积碳形成。较小的孔可能限制积碳形成，但更容易完全堵塞。

连通性：更高的孔连通性可能通过在某些孔被堵塞时为反应物和产物提供替代路径，从而使催化剂活性保持更长时间。然而，它也可能促进积碳在整个颗粒中的扩散。

均匀性：不均匀的孔结构可能导致不均匀的积碳分布，某些区域积碳严重，而其他区域则相对干净。这可能导致催化剂利用效率低下。

层次结构：具有大孔和微孔的层次孔结构可能平衡积碳容纳和反应物扩散。大孔可以作为反应物运输的"高速公路"，而微孔则提供高比表面积用于反应。

随着积碳的进行，它会使孔变窄并最终堵塞，导致孔网络结构发生显著变化。这个过程不仅覆盖活性位点，还增加扩散阻力，并可能使某些活性位点无法接触，特别是当大孔被堵塞的孔包围时。

这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的启示包括：

1. 开发平衡积碳容纳和反应物扩散的孔结构。
2. 创建即使某些孔被堵塞也能保持连通性的稳健孔网络。
3. 设计具有层次孔结构的催化剂颗粒，以优化反应和质量传递。
4. 考虑孔网络内活性位点的分布，以最大化催化剂利用率。
5. 设计促进更均匀积碳沉积的孔结构，以延长催化剂寿命。

理解这些关系对于创造在PDH反应中更耐失活和能够长期保持高性能的催化剂至关重要。

The literature suggests that the pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Several key aspects of pore structure impact these processes:

1. Pore size: Larger pores can accommodate more coke before becoming plugged, potentially extending catalyst lifetime. However, they may also become inaccessible if surrounded by smaller, coke-plugged pores.

2. Connectivity: Higher pore connectivity can help maintain diffusion pathways even as some pores become blocked, improving overall catalyst performance and longevity.

3. Uniformity: A more uniform pore size distribution may lead to more predictable coke formation and deactivation patterns, while a heterogeneous structure could result in localized coke accumulation and pore blockage.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: Multi-scale pore structures could potentially balance the benefits of larger pores for coke accommodation with smaller pores for increased surface area and activity.

The literature emphasizes the importance of considering percolation phenomena, where a critical threshold of open pores is required to maintain connectivity throughout the catalyst particle. This suggests that designing pore structures to delay or prevent reaching this threshold could significantly improve catalyst performance.

These relationships have important implications for catalyst design:

1. Optimizing pore size distribution to balance coke accommodation and accessibility.
2. Enhancing pore connectivity to maintain diffusion pathways.
3. Considering hierarchical pore structures to combine the benefits of different pore sizes.
4. Designing pore networks that are resistant to percolation effects, maintaining connectivity even as coke accumulates.

By carefully tailoring these aspects of pore structure, it may be possible to create catalysts with improved resistance to deactivation, longer lifetimes, and better overall performance in PDH reactions.

文献表明，催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、积炭容纳能力和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。孔结构的几个关键方面影响这些过程：

1. 孔径：较大的孔可以在被堵塞之前容纳更多的积炭，可能延长催化剂寿命。但是，如果被较小的、被积炭堵塞的孔包围，它们也可能变得无法接触。

2. 连通性：较高的孔连通性可以帮助维持扩散通道，即使一些孔被堵塞，从而改善整体催化剂性能和寿命。

3. 均匀性：更均匀的孔径分布可能导致更可预测的积炭形成和失活模式，而不均匀的结构可能导致局部积炭积累和孔道堵塞。

4. 分层排列：多尺度孔结构可能平衡大孔用于积炭容纳和小孔用于增加表面积和活性的优势。

文献强调了考虑渗流现象的重要性，其中需要一定比例的开放孔来维持整个催化剂颗粒的连通性。这表明，设计孔结构以延迟或防止达到这个临界值可以显著改善催化剂性能。

这些关系对催化剂设计有重要启示：

1. 优化孔径分布，平衡积炭容纳能力和可接触性。
2. 增强孔连通性以维持扩散通道。
3. 考虑分层孔结构，结合不同孔径的优势。
4. 设计能抵抗渗流效应的孔网络，即使在积炭积累时也能保持连通性。

The pore network structure of catalyst supports has a significant influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key characteristics that impact these processes include:

1. Pore size: The model uses a log-normal distribution of pore radii, which affects diffusion rates and coke accumulation. Smaller pores are more likely to become blocked by coke, while larger pores can accommodate more coke before deactivation.

2. Connectivity: The model uses a fixed pore connectivity (Z) for all inner nodes. Higher connectivity can improve diffusion and potentially delay deactivation by providing alternative pathways when some pores become blocked.

3. Uniformity: The random assignment of pore radii introduces non-uniformity, which can lead to localized coke formation and non-uniform deactivation across the catalyst particle.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: While not explicitly mentioned, the combination of different pore sizes and connectivity can create hierarchical structures that influence coke distribution and catalyst performance.

These characteristics affect the capacity to contain coke, the distribution of coke within the catalyst particle, and the relationship between coke content and apparent reaction rate. The pore network structure impacts diffusion limitations, pore blockage, and the accessibility of active sites, all of which contribute to the overall catalyst performance and deactivation process.

For designing optimal and effective catalysts, these relationships imply that:

1. A balanced pore size distribution is crucial, with larger pores to accommodate coke and smaller pores to maintain high surface area.

2. Higher pore connectivity can improve catalyst longevity by providing alternative diffusion pathways.

3. Controlled non-uniformity might be beneficial in creating preferential coke deposition zones away from critical active sites.

4. Hierarchical pore structures could be designed to optimize both coke accommodation and reactant/product diffusion.

5. Tailoring the pore network structure can potentially increase the catalyst's capacity to contain coke without severe performance loss.

By considering these factors in catalyst design, it may be possible to create more coke-resistant and longer-lasting catalysts for PDH reactions, improving overall process efficiency and economics.
