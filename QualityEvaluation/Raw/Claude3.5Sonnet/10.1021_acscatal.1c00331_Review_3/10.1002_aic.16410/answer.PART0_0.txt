The pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors include:

1. Pore size: The model uses a log-normal distribution of pore radii, which affects diffusion, reaction rates, and coke deposition. Smaller pores are more prone to blockage, while larger pores can accommodate more coke.

2. Connectivity: The model uses a simplified approach with uniform connectivity for inner nodes. Higher connectivity generally improves mass transfer and coke distribution, potentially enhancing catalyst longevity.

3. Uniformity: The random assignment of pore radii introduces non-uniformity, which can lead to preferential coke deposition and localized deactivation.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: While not explicitly mentioned, the model's ability to represent complex pore networks suggests that hierarchical structures could be studied, potentially revealing benefits of multi-scale porosity.

These relationships imply that optimal catalyst design should focus on:

1. Balancing pore sizes to maximize coke accommodation while maintaining sufficient diffusion rates.
2. Enhancing pore connectivity to improve mass transfer and coke distribution.
3. Controlling pore size uniformity to prevent localized deactivation.
4. Exploring hierarchical pore structures to optimize both reaction and coke accommodation processes.

The pore network model provides a powerful tool for understanding these complex relationships and guiding the design of more effective PDH catalysts with improved coke resistance and longevity.

催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。关键因素包括：

1. 孔径：模型使用对数正态分布的孔径，这影响扩散、反应速率和积碳沉积。较小的孔更容易堵塞，而较大的孔可以容纳更多积碳。

2. 连通性：模型对内部节点使用统一的连通性简化方法。较高的连通性通常可以改善物质传递和积碳分布，可能延长催化剂寿命。

3. 均匀性：随机分配的孔径引入了非均匀性，这可能导致优先积碳沉积和局部失活。

4. 分级排列：虽然没有明确提及，但模型能够表示复杂的孔网络，表明可以研究分级结构，potentially揭示多尺度孔隙度的优势。

这些关系意味着最佳催化剂设计应该关注：

1. 平衡孔径大小，以最大化积碳容纳能力，同时保持足够的扩散速率。
2. 增强孔隙连通性，改善物质传递和积碳分布。
3. 控制孔径均匀性，防止局部失活。
4. 探索分级孔结构，以优化反应和积碳容纳过程。

孔网络模型为理解这些复杂关系提供了强大的工具，可以指导设计更有效的PDH催化剂，提高抗积碳能力和延长使用寿命。
