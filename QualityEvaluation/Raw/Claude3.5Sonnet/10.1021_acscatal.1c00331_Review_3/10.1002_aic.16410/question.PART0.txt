A versatile pore network model is used to study deactivation by coking in a single catalyst particle. This approach allows
to gain detailed insights into the progression of deactivation from active site, to pore, and to particleproviding valuable
information for catalyst design. The model is applied to investigate deactivation by coking during propane dehydrogenation
in a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst particle. We find that the deactivation process can be separated into two stages when there exist
severe diffusion limitation and pore blockage, and the toxicity of coke formed in the later stage is much stronger than of
coke formed in the early stage. The reaction temperature and composition change the coking rate and apparent reaction
rate, informed by the kinetics, but, remarkably, they do not change the capacity for a catalyst particle to accommodate
coke. Conversely, the pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke.  2018 The Authors. AIChE

Introduction
Propylene is a key feedstock in the petrochemical industry,
which is widely used in the production of many important che-
micals (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and
cumene).1,2 Propylene is traditionally produced as a byproduct
from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, but these
processes cannot satisfy the ever-growing demand for propyl-
ene in recent years.3 Hence, techniques for the purposeful pro-
duction of propylene (including propane dehydrogenation,
Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins, and methanol-to-olefins) have been
developed and commercialized.4 Among these, propane dehy-
drogenation is currently one of the most economical, due to
the large price gap between propane and propylene.1
A major problem during propane dehydrogenation is the
fast catalyst deactivation by coke formation. This problem per-
sists in industrial processes. For example, the Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O3
catalyst used in the Uhde STAR process is significantly deacti-
vated by coke after 7 h on stream; the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst
used in the Catofin process should be regenerated after only
12 min.1,5,6 Hence, it is of great importance to design robust
catalysts against deactivation by coke formation for propane
dehydrogenation. To achieve such robust catalysts, it is essen-
tial to understand coking and deactivation at different length
scales.
Froment7-9 classified catalyst deactivation phenomena asso-
ciated with coke deposition into three levels: micro-level,
meso-level, and macro-level. At the micro-level or the active
site level, coke covers active sites and isolates these sites from
reactants. At this level, it is essential to understand chemical
pathways leading to coke precursors, as well as the interaction
of these precursors with active sites. At the meso-level or the
particle level, coke narrows and even blocks pores, leading to
reduced active sites and enhanced diffusion resistance. Hence,
at this level, the effect of the pore network structure on coking
and deactivation must be accounted for. Finally, at the macro-
level or the reactor level, flow and heat transfer affect coking
and deactivation of catalysts packed in the reactor, resulting in
transient behavior.
For propane dehydrogenation, coking and deactivation at
the active site level and the reactor level were extensively
investigated. Many density functional theory calculations10-13
were performed to probe pathways and mechanisms of coke
formation over active sites; some kinetic experiments14-18 were
also conducted to correlate deactivation with coking in a quan-
titative way. Such studies can guide the rational design of cat-
alysts at the active site level, to screen promoters and tailor

active sites. Fixed bed, moving bed, and fluidized bed reactors
have been successfully applied in commercial processes for
propane dehydrogenation, and much effort19-23 has been
devoted to exploring coking and deactivation in these reactors.
This work has contributed to novel reactor designs, such as
two-zone fluidized bed reactors.20-22
However, up to now, coking and deactivation at the particle
or meso-level during propane dehydrogenation has not been
reported in the literature, although the knowledge of this is
essential to design the catalyst particle, which includes its pore
network structure and active site distribution.24-26 The process
of coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle is very com-
plex. Coke can be nonuniformly distributed through the cata-
lyst particle, and the distribution of coke is largely affected by
the pore network structure and reaction conditions.27-30 Coke
narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to
significant changes in pore network structure.31-33 Some large
pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become
inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity
of the coking process. In addition, a percolation phenomenon
occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops
below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected,
particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes discon-
nected.24,30,34,35
In
this
case,
macroscopic
properties
(e.g., effective diffusivity and the observed reaction rates)
would experience a sudden change.24,30,34 This critical fraction
of open pores is known as the percolation threshold.35 Finally,
coke deactivates catalyst particles in several ways, not just by
covering active sites; a significant loss in activity can also be
caused by the increased diffusion resistance and inaccessible
active sites when coke narrows and plugs pores.27,28,33 Con-
sidering the above complications, a proper mathematical
model is needed to probe coking and deactivation at the parti-
cle level, which is what this article sets out to do.
Continuum and discrete models34,36 can be used to simulate
coking and deactivation in a catalyst particle. Continuum models
are characterized by a pseudo-homogeneous description of diffu-
sivities, reaction rates, tortuosity factors, and many other macro-
scopic properties at a length scale much larger than the
dimension of individual pores.29,30,34 Due to this characteristic,
continuum models cannot describe percolation phenomena and
their associated impacts on catalyst performance. Zhang and
Seaton37 compared continuum models with discrete models, and
they proved that continuum models break down when the pore
network is close to a percolation threshold. Examples of discrete
models are the Bethe lattice38 and various pore network
models39,40 to describe both morphology and topology of the
pore space in catalyst particles. Moreover, pore network models
have been successfully used to describe percolation phenomena
in some reaction systems, such as hydrodemetallation,24,29,30
hydrodesulphurization,41,42
benzene
hydrogenation,43,44
and
deactivation of immobilized glucose isomerase.40,45,46 Therefore,
a pore network model should be used to probe coking and deac-
tivation during propane dehydrogenation in a catalyst particle.
In this work, a pore network model is first proposed to
describe the coupled diffusion, reaction, coking, and deactiva-
tion processes in a catalyst particle for propane dehydrogena-
tion. With this pore network model, we obtain and analyze
representative distributions of coke in the catalyst particle,
concentration profiles of reactant and products, and the
relation between coke content and apparent reaction rate.
Eventually, we probe the effects of coking kinetics, reaction
conditions, and pore network structure on coking and deacti-
vation processes in the catalyst particle.
Model Formulation
The proposed pore network model can be divided into three
interconnected parts, namely, the pore network, diffusion and
reaction, and coking and deactivation. Before introducing
these parts, the following important assumptions are made. Pt-
Sn/Al2O3 is taken as the model catalyst, as it is a widely used
catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in industry. The gradi-
ents of temperature and total pressure in the catalyst particle
are neglected, which is proven to be reasonable in Supporting
Information Figure S1. Only the main reaction and coke for-
mation reaction are considered, as other side reactions, like
propane cracking, can be neglected under the relevant reaction
conditions for propane dehydrogenation.1 Coke is assumed to
be noncatalytic and its formation is irreversible; the density of
coke is set to 1200 kg/m3, which is within the range reported
in the literature.47,48 Finally, at 1 bar, the gas mixture follows
the ideal gas law.
Pore network
The pore space of a catalyst particle is represented by the
pore network within a two-dimensional disc domain, as
illustrated in Figure 1. Two-dimensional pore networks should
be adequate to describe the primary features of the pore struc-
ture in real catalyst particles and to investigate the effects of
the pore structure on deactivation by coke formation, although
the dimensionality of the pore network would quantitatively,
but not qualitatively, influence the results.29 Using two-
dimensional pore networks reduces the computational time to
within a reasonable limit: it takes several hours to conduct a
simulation when using a two-dimensional pore network in this
work, while the computational time for the same simulation is
about 25 times longer (this is, several days) when using a
three-dimensional pore network.
The method for generating the pore network is adopted
from the work by Ye et al.,40 in which more details of this

method are given. The nodes in the pore network are treated
as zero-volume intersections, while the bonds are assumed to
be cylindrical pores. The pore connectivity (Z) is kept the
same for all inner nodes to simplify the pore network. The
original pore radius (ro) for the fresh catalyst particle is ran-
domly assigned, but follows a log-normal distribution44:

Here, Vt is the total pore volume of the catalyst particle, ra
is the volume-averaged pore radius, and σ is the standard devi-
ation of the natural logarithm of the pore radius. The above
structural parameters can be obtained from nitrogen sorption
and mercury porosimetry measurements.49
Diffusion and reaction
In the pore network, the process of diffusion and main reac-
tion can be mathematically described using different equations
in pore channels and nodes; the solution of these equations
yields concentration profiles of reactant and products. In a
pore channel, the diffusionreaction equation for compo-
nent i is:
Ci
t  Ji
l + 2roRi
r2
2
where Ci is the concentration of component i, l and r are the
length and radius of the pore, Ji is the diffusion flux of compo-
nent i, and Ri is the reaction rate of component i per unit pore
surface area. As, the coking rate is much slower than the rate of
diffusion and reaction in this reaction system,1 the quasi-steady-
state condition is satisfied, and Eq. 2 can be simplified to:
0  dJi
dl + 2roRi
r2

The diffusion flux (Ji) is described by Ficks law with an
effective diffusivity calculated by the WilkeBosanquet equation:

Here, Di,e is the effective diffusivity of component i, Di,K is
the Knudsen diffusivity of component i that can be obtained
from the kinetic theory of gases,50 Di,j is the binary diffusivity
of component i in a mixture of i and j that can be calculated
from the ChapmanEnskog equation,51 and xi is the mole frac-
tion of component i. The WilkeBosanquet model is a very
good approximation of the Dusty Gas model in this case, as
proven in Supporting Information Figure S2. Besides, the
WilkeBosanquet model is computationally less demanding. It
should be noted that coke deposition can narrow pores signifi-
cantly, so that restricted, configurational diffusion becomes
important. To account for this restricted diffusion, the equation
for the effective diffusivity, Eq. 5, is modified24,25,32:

Here, a represents the level of activity of the catalyst for the
main reaction (for a fresh catalyst, a = 1; for a spent catalyst,
a < 1), which is calculated by Eqs. 12 and 13; vi is the stoi-
chiometric number of component i; k1 is the reaction rate con-
stant of the main reaction; Sk = 56.6 m2/g is the specific

equilibrium constant of the main reaction; K2 and K3 are the

the partial pressures of propane, propylene, and hydrogen,
respectively. In Eq. 8, the values of the kinetic and thermody-
namic parameters (k1, K, K2, and K3), which are functions of
temperature, can be found in the work by Li et al.16

and Ji,n is the diffusion flux of component i in pore n. In a
boundary node, a Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed, as
we only concentrate on processes inside the catalyst particle:
Ci  Ci,b
10
where Ci,b is the bulk concentration of component i.
Coking and deactivation
In the pore network, coking and deactivation occur simulta-
neously; they affect each other in three ways, namely, through
site coverage, pore narrowing, and pore blockage,7-9 as shown
in Figure 2. First, coke causes deactivation by covering active
sites, which is reflected by the catalyst activity (a) in Eq. 8.
Then, coke narrows pores and, subsequently, reduces the
effective diffusivity (Di,e) in Eq. 7. Finally, coke plugs pores,
and some open pores become isolated from the bulk phase;
meanwhile, active sites in these pores become inaccessible to
reactant and products. The coke formation reaction also deacti-
vates itself in the same three ways.
The coking rate per unit pore surface area (Rc) is adopted
from the literature16:
Rc  dCc
dt  ac
kcPC3H6
1 + K3PH2
11
where Cc (g/m2) is the loading of coke in a pore channel per
unit surface area; ac is the catalyst activity for coke formation,
which is described by Eqs. 12 and 13; and kc is the reaction
rate constant of the coking reaction. When assuming that the
coke formation reaction and main reaction occur by a single
site mechanism on the same active sites, and coke uniformly
deactivates these active sites, the relation between coke load-
ing and activity can be described by8,32,52:
a  ac  Ccm Cc
Ccm
12
where Ccm is the maximum loading of coke required to
completely deactivate the active sites on the catalyst surface,
which is constant for a specific catalyst. Equation 12 is a good

approximation to describe the relation between coke loading
and activity, as proven by Li et al.16 Combining Eqs. 11 and
12, we can obtain:
da
dt  a kdPC3H6
1 + K3PH2

13
where the deactivation rate constant (kd) is a function of
temperature and its value is adopted from the literature.16
The loading of coke at time t + Δt is calculated by:
Cc t + Δt
  Cc t
  + Rc t
 Δt
14
where Δt is the time step. As coking proceeds, the pore net-
work structure changes accordingly. The coke can accumulate
on both metal sites (Pt-Sn) and support (Al2O3), due to the
shift of the coke from metal sites to support, especially in the
presence of Sn in the catalyst.53 Thus, we assume that coke
uniformly covers the pore surface, and the pore radius can be
determined for a given coke loading32:

where ρc is the density of coke. If r is less than the molecu-
lar radius of propane (0.215 nm),54 the pore is considered
plugged by coke. Some open pores can become inaccessible
to reactant and products when they are surrounded by these
plugged pores (see Figure 2c). In our work, the extended
HoshenKopelman algorithm55 is used to identify these inac-
cessible pores.
Implementation
The algorithm to solve the pore network model consists of
three tightly coupled steps (see Figure 3); the details of these
steps are given in the previous three subsections. In step 1, the
pore network is constructed according to predefined topologi-
cal and morphological parameters, and an initial guess for the
concentrations is assigned to the pore network. In step 2, equa-
tions for diffusion and reaction in the pore network are solved
by iteration to yield concentration profiles of reactant and
products at time t, and the parameters for the pore network
and catalyst activities used in this step are adopted from step
3. In step 3, equations for coking and deactivation are solved
to update the pore network structure and catalyst activities at
time t + Δt, in which the concentration profiles calculated in
step 2 are used. If time t + Δt does not reach the maximum
time for reaction (tm), the process returns to step 2; if time
t + Δt exceeds tm, the results are output and the process is
ended. The above algorithm is implemented in MATLAB
2010b, however, using a newer version of MATLAB can
increase the computational speed. Some data are visualized
using Rhinoceros 4.0.
The solution of the pore network model yields concentration
profiles of reactant, products, and coke in the pore network, as
well as distributions of reaction rates for propane dehydroge-
nation and coke formation. With these results, the dimension-
less coke content in the catalyst particle (Wc) can be
calculated by32:

where N is the total number of pores in the pore network.
As coking proceeds, Wc increases with time and the value of
Wc at the end of reaction (or at the final reaction time) reflects
the capacity for a catalyst particle to accommodate coke. The
apparent reaction rate for propane dehydrogenation (Rapp) can
be calculated using a scaling rule24,36:

where RPN is the overall reaction rate in the pore network,
f is the thus-defined scaling factor, RC3H6,n is the formation rate
of propylene in pore n, and S is the internal surface area of the
catalyst particle. The decrease of Rapp with time directly
reflects the deactivation process. Meanwhile, Rapp can also
correlate with Wc, which gives the relationship between deacti-
vation and coking.
The parameters used in the simulations are presented in
Table 1. The number of nodes, 1393, is adequate and reason-
able, because adding more nodes does not change the simula-
tion results, but increases computational cost significantly (see
