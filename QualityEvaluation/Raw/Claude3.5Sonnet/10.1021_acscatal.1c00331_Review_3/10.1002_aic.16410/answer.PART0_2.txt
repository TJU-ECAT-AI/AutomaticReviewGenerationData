The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The pore network structure affects the capacity to contain coke and plays a crucial role in the coking and deactivation processes.

Pore size: Larger pores can accommodate more coke before becoming completely blocked, but they may also allow for faster coke formation due to easier access of reactants. Smaller pores may limit coke formation but are more susceptible to complete blockage.

Connectivity: Higher pore connectivity can potentially maintain catalyst activity for longer periods by providing alternative pathways for reactants and products when some pores become blocked. However, it may also facilitate coke spread throughout the particle.

Uniformity: Non-uniform pore structures can lead to uneven coke distribution, with some areas becoming heavily coked while others remain relatively clean. This can result in inefficient catalyst utilization.

Hierarchical arrangements: A hierarchical pore structure with both macro- and micropores could potentially balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion. Macropores can serve as "highways" for reactant transport, while micropores provide high surface area for the reaction.

As coking progresses, it narrows and eventually plugs pores, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process not only covers active sites but also increases diffusion resistance and can make some active sites inaccessible, particularly when large pores become surrounded by plugged pores.

The implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include:

1. Developing pore structures that balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion.
2. Creating robust pore networks that maintain connectivity even as some pores become blocked.
3. Designing catalyst particles with hierarchical pore structures to optimize both reaction and mass transfer.
4. Considering the distribution of active sites within the pore network to maximize catalyst utilization.
5. Engineering pore structures that promote more uniform coke deposition to extend catalyst lifetime.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for creating catalysts that are more resistant to deactivation and can maintain high performance over longer periods in PDH reactions.

催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。孔网络结构影响了容纳积碳的能力，并在积碳和失活过程中起着关键作用。

孔径：较大的孔可以在完全堵塞之前容纳更多的积碳，但也可能由于反应物更容易进入而导致更快的积碳形成。较小的孔可能限制积碳形成，但更容易完全堵塞。

连通性：更高的孔连通性可能通过在某些孔被堵塞时为反应物和产物提供替代路径，从而使催化剂活性保持更长时间。然而，它也可能促进积碳在整个颗粒中的扩散。

均匀性：不均匀的孔结构可能导致不均匀的积碳分布，某些区域积碳严重，而其他区域则相对干净。这可能导致催化剂利用效率低下。

层次结构：具有大孔和微孔的层次孔结构可能平衡积碳容纳和反应物扩散。大孔可以作为反应物运输的"高速公路"，而微孔则提供高比表面积用于反应。

随着积碳的进行，它会使孔变窄并最终堵塞，导致孔网络结构发生显著变化。这个过程不仅覆盖活性位点，还增加扩散阻力，并可能使某些活性位点无法接触，特别是当大孔被堵塞的孔包围时。

这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的启示包括：

1. 开发平衡积碳容纳和反应物扩散的孔结构。
2. 创建即使某些孔被堵塞也能保持连通性的稳健孔网络。
3. 设计具有层次孔结构的催化剂颗粒，以优化反应和质量传递。
4. 考虑孔网络内活性位点的分布，以最大化催化剂利用率。
5. 设计促进更均匀积碳沉积的孔结构，以延长催化剂寿命。

理解这些关系对于创造在PDH反应中更耐失活和能够长期保持高性能的催化剂至关重要。
