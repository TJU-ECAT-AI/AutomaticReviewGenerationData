[1] "Conversely, the pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

[2] "Hence, at this level, the effect of the pore network structure on coking and deactivation must be accounted for."

[3] "Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to significant changes in pore network structure."

[4] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."

[5] "In addition, a percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."

The literature indicates that various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore network structure: This has a major impact on the catalyst's capacity to contain coke. The arrangement and connectivity of pores affect how coke accumulates and distributes throughout the catalyst particle.

2. Pore size: As coke forms, it narrows pores and eventually plugs them. Larger pores may take longer to become fully blocked, potentially allowing for greater coke accommodation before significant deactivation occurs.

3. Connectivity: The interconnectedness of pores affects how coke formation in one area impacts other regions of the catalyst. Higher connectivity may help maintain access to active sites even as some pores become blocked.

4. Uniformity vs. hierarchical arrangements: Non-uniform pore structures, such as those with a hierarchical arrangement of pore sizes, may be beneficial. Larger pores could serve as "highways" for reactant transport, while smaller pores provide high surface area for reactions.

5. Percolation effects: When the fraction of open pores drops below a critical threshold, a percolation phenomenon occurs, leading to a sudden disconnection of the pore network. This can cause a dramatic change in catalyst performance.

These relationships have several implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts:

1. Tailoring pore size distribution: A carefully designed distribution of pore sizes could balance coke accommodation capacity with maintenance of active site accessibility.

2. Optimizing connectivity: Higher pore connectivity could improve catalyst longevity by maintaining reactant access to active sites even as some pores become blocked.

3. Incorporating hierarchical structures: Catalysts with hierarchical pore structures might better balance reactant transport and surface area requirements.

4. Considering percolation thresholds: Catalyst designs should aim to delay reaching the percolation threshold, perhaps by incorporating more robust transport pathways that are less susceptible to blockage.

5. Balancing competing factors: Optimal catalyst design must balance coke accommodation capacity, maintenance of active site accessibility, and overall reaction performance.

In conclusion, understanding and manipulating these pore structure characteristics can lead to the development of more coke-resistant and longer-lasting catalysts for PDH reactions, potentially improving process efficiency and reducing the frequency of catalyst regeneration or replacement.

文献表明，催化剂支撑体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：

1. 孔网络结构：这对催化剂容纳积碳的能力有重大影响。孔的排列和连通性影响积碳在催化剂颗粒中的累积和分布方式。

2. 孔径：随着积碳形成，孔径变窄并最终堵塞。较大的孔可能需要更长时间才能完全堵塞，这可能允许在显著失活之前容纳更多积碳。

3. 连通性：孔的互连性影响一个区域的积碳形成如何影响催化剂的其他区域。更高的连通性可能有助于在某些孔被堵塞的情况下仍然保持对活性位点的访问。

4. 均匀性vs层级排列：非均匀的孔结构，如具有层级孔径排列的结构，可能是有益的。较大的孔可以作为反应物输送的"高速公路"，而较小的孔提供高表面积用于反应。

5. 渗流效应：当开放孔的比例降至临界阈值以下时，会发生渗流现象，导致孔网络突然断开。这可能导致催化剂性能的显著变化。

这些关系对设计最优和有效的催化剂有几个启示：

1. 定制孔径分布：精心设计的孔径分布可以平衡积碳容纳能力和保持活性位点可访问性。

2. 优化连通性：更高的孔连通性可以通过在某些孔被堵塞的情况下仍然保持反应物对活性位点的访问，从而提高催化剂的寿命。

3. 纳入层级结构：具有层级孔结构的催化剂可能更好地平衡反应物传输和表面积要求。

4. 考虑渗流阈值：催化剂设计应该旨在延迟达到渗流阈值，可能通过纳入更具鲁棒性的传输路径，这些路径不太容易被堵塞。

5. 平衡竞争因素：最佳催化剂设计必须平衡积碳容纳能力、保持活性位点可访问性和整体反应性能。

总之，理解和操纵这些孔结构特征可以导致开发出更耐积碳和更长寿命的PDH反应催化剂，可能提高过程效率并减少催化剂再生或更换的频率。
