[1] "Conversely, the pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

[2] "Hence, at this level, the effect of the pore network structure on coking and deactivation must be accounted for."

[3] "Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to significant changes in pore network structure."

[4] "Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."

[5] "In addition, a percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."

The literature suggests that the pore network structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Several key aspects of pore structure impact these processes:

1. Pore size: Larger pores can accommodate more coke before becoming plugged, potentially extending catalyst lifetime. However, they may also become inaccessible if surrounded by smaller, coke-plugged pores.

2. Connectivity: Higher pore connectivity can help maintain diffusion pathways even as some pores become blocked, improving overall catalyst performance and longevity.

3. Uniformity: A more uniform pore size distribution may lead to more predictable coke formation and deactivation patterns, while a heterogeneous structure could result in localized coke accumulation and pore blockage.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: Multi-scale pore structures could potentially balance the benefits of larger pores for coke accommodation with smaller pores for increased surface area and activity.

The literature emphasizes the importance of considering percolation phenomena, where a critical threshold of open pores is required to maintain connectivity throughout the catalyst particle. This suggests that designing pore structures to delay or prevent reaching this threshold could significantly improve catalyst performance.

These relationships have important implications for catalyst design:

1. Optimizing pore size distribution to balance coke accommodation and accessibility.
2. Enhancing pore connectivity to maintain diffusion pathways.
3. Considering hierarchical pore structures to combine the benefits of different pore sizes.
4. Designing pore networks that are resistant to percolation effects, maintaining connectivity even as coke accumulates.

By carefully tailoring these aspects of pore structure, it may be possible to create catalysts with improved resistance to deactivation, longer lifetimes, and better overall performance in PDH reactions.

文献表明，催化剂载体的孔网络结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、积炭容纳能力和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。孔结构的几个关键方面影响这些过程：

1. 孔径：较大的孔可以在被堵塞之前容纳更多的积炭，可能延长催化剂寿命。但是，如果被较小的、被积炭堵塞的孔包围，它们也可能变得无法接触。

2. 连通性：较高的孔连通性可以帮助维持扩散通道，即使一些孔被堵塞，从而改善整体催化剂性能和寿命。

3. 均匀性：更均匀的孔径分布可能导致更可预测的积炭形成和失活模式，而不均匀的结构可能导致局部积炭积累和孔道堵塞。

4. 分层排列：多尺度孔结构可能平衡大孔用于积炭容纳和小孔用于增加表面积和活性的优势。

文献强调了考虑渗流现象的重要性，其中需要一定比例的开放孔来维持整个催化剂颗粒的连通性。这表明，设计孔结构以延迟或防止达到这个临界值可以显著改善催化剂性能。

这些关系对催化剂设计有重要启示：

1. 优化孔径分布，平衡积炭容纳能力和可接触性。
2. 增强孔连通性以维持扩散通道。
3. 考虑分层孔结构，结合不同孔径的优势。
4. 设计能抵抗渗流效应的孔网络，即使在积炭积累时也能保持连通性。

通过仔细调整这些孔结构方面，可能创造出在PDH反应中具有更强抗失活能力、更长寿命和更好整体性能的催化剂。
