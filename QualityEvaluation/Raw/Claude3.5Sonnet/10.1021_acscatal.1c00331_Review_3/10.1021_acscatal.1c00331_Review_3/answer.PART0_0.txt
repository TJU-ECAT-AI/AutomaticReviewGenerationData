[1] "The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation."

[2] "The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, (96) which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke."

[3] "The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support."

[4] "A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Pore size plays a crucial role, with microporous supports demonstrating better selectivity, stability, and lower coke formation compared to mesoporous supports. The introduction of hierarchical pores in zeolite supports like ZSM-5 reduces support acidity, inhibiting coke formation on the metal and improving the support's capacity for coke accommodation.

Pore connectivity and uniformity also impact coke formation and catalyst performance. Supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, potentially extending catalyst lifetime. However, this increased coke capacity must be balanced against the need for optimal catalytic activity and selectivity.

These relationships between pore structure characteristics and catalyst performance have important implications for designing optimal PDH catalysts. Developers should focus on creating supports with carefully tailored pore structures that balance coke accommodation capacity with catalytic performance. This may involve using hierarchical pore structures, optimizing pore size distributions, and enhancing pore connectivity while maintaining the benefits of microporous supports for improved selectivity and stability.

催化剂载体孔结构的特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。孔径起着关键作用，微孔载体相比介孔载体表现出更好的选择性、稳定性和更低的焦炭形成。在沸石载体（如ZSM-5）中引入分级孔可降低载体酸度，抑制金属上的焦炭形成，并提高载体对焦炭的容纳能力。

孔隙连通性和均匀性也影响焦炭形成和催化剂性能。具有更均匀、高度连通和较大孔径的载体可以容纳更多焦炭，可能延长催化剂寿命。然而，这种增加的焦炭容量必须与最佳催化活性和选择性的需求保持平衡。

孔结构特征与催化剂性能之间的这些关系对设计最佳PDH催化剂有重要影响。开发人员应专注于创建具有精心设计的孔结构的载体，平衡焦炭容纳能力和催化性能。这可能涉及使用分级孔结构、优化孔径分布，以及增强孔隙连通性，同时保持微孔载体的优势，以提高选择性和稳定性。
