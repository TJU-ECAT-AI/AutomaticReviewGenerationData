The pore structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

Microporous supports generally perform better than mesoporous supports, exhibiting improved selectivity, stability, and lower coke formation. This suggests that smaller pore sizes may be beneficial for PDH reactions.

However, supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger pores can accommodate more coke. This implies that there's a trade-off between coke formation and coke accommodation capacity.

Hierarchical pore structures, such as those introduced in ZSM-5, can decrease the acidity of the support. This modification inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity to accommodate coke.

These relationships highlight the complexity of designing optimal PDH catalysts. The ideal support structure needs to balance various factors:
1. Pore size: smaller pores for better performance, but larger pores for increased coke accommodation
2. Pore connectivity: higher connectivity for improved coke accommodation
3. Pore uniformity: more uniform pores for better coke accommodation
4. Hierarchical arrangements: to reduce acidity and improve coke management

The implications for catalyst design are that a carefully tailored pore structure is crucial. An optimal catalyst might feature a hierarchical pore structure with predominantly microporous characteristics for good performance, combined with some larger, well-connected pores to accommodate coke and extend catalyst life. The exact balance would depend on the specific reaction conditions and desired performance characteristics.

催化剂载体的孔结构对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。

微孔载体通常比介孔载体表现更好，表现出更好的选择性、稳定性和更低的积碳形成。这表明较小的孔径可能有利于PDH反应。

然而，具有更均匀、高度连通和更大孔径的载体可以容纳更多积碳。这意味着积碳形成和积碳容纳能力之间存在权衡。

分级孔结构，如在ZSM-5中引入的，可以降低载体的酸性。这种改性抑制了金属上的积碳形成，并提高了载体容纳积碳的能力。

这些关系突显了设计最佳PDH催化剂的复杂性。理想的载体结构需要平衡各种因素：
1. 孔径：较小的孔径以获得更好的性能，但较大的孔径以增加积碳容纳能力
2. 孔连通性：较高的连通性以改善积碳容纳
3. 孔均匀性：更均匀的孔以更好地容纳积碳
4. 分级排列：降低酸性并改善积碳管理

这对催化剂设计的启示是，精心设计的孔结构至关重要。最佳催化剂可能具有分级孔结构，主要为微孔特征以获得良好性能，同时结合一些较大、连通良好的孔以容纳积碳并延长催化剂寿命。确切的平衡将取决于具体的反应条件和所需的性能特征。
