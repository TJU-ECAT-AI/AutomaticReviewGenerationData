The pore structure of catalyst supports significantly influences coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Microporous supports generally lead to better selectivity, stability, and lower coke formation compared to mesoporous supports. However, supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger pores can accommodate more coke.

Introducing hierarchical pores in zeolites like ZSM-5 can decrease the support's acidity, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity to accommodate coke. This modification helps balance the trade-off between coke formation and accommodation.

These relationships suggest that optimal catalyst design should consider a balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. While microporous supports generally perform better, introducing some larger pores in a hierarchical structure can help manage coke accumulation. The goal is to design a pore structure that minimizes initial coke formation while providing sufficient capacity to accommodate unavoidable coke deposits, thereby extending catalyst lifetime and maintaining performance over time.

催化剂载体的孔结构对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。微孔载体通常比介孔载体具有更好的选择性、稳定性和更低的积碳量。然而，具有更均匀、高度连通和更大孔径的载体可以容纳更多的积碳。

在沸石（如ZSM-5）中引入分级孔可以降低载体的酸度，这抑制了金属上的积碳形成，并提高了载体容纳积碳的能力。这种改性有助于平衡积碳形成和容纳之间的权衡。

这些关系表明，最佳催化剂设计应考虑孔径、连通性和均匀性之间的平衡。虽然微孔载体通常表现更好，但在分级结构中引入一些较大的孔可以帮助管理积碳累积。设计目标是创造一种孔结构，既能最小化初始积碳形成，又能提供足够的容量来容纳不可避免的积碳沉积，从而延长催化剂寿命并长期保持性能。
