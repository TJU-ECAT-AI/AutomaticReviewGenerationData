The pore structure of catalyst supports plays a crucial role in coke formation and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Microporous supports generally lead to better selectivity, stability, and lower coke formation compared to mesoporous supports. However, supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, potentially extending catalyst lifetime.

Hierarchical pore structures, such as those introduced in ZSM-5 zeolites, can decrease support acidity, inhibiting coke formation on the metal and improving the support's capacity to accommodate coke. This suggests that carefully engineered hierarchical pore structures could offer a balance between coke inhibition and accommodation.

These relationships imply that optimal catalyst design should consider a balance between pore size, connectivity, and uniformity. Microporous supports may be preferred for their superior performance, but introducing some larger pores or hierarchical structures could help manage coke accumulation. The goal would be to design a support that inhibits initial coke formation while providing sufficient capacity to accommodate unavoidable coke deposits, thus extending catalyst lifetime and maintaining performance over time.

催化剂载体的孔结构在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和整体催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。微孔载体通常比介孔载体具有更好的选择性、稳定性和更低的积碳形成。然而，具有更均匀、高度连接和更大尺寸孔的载体可以容纳更多的积碳，潜在地延长催化剂寿命。

层次孔结构，如在ZSM-5沸石中引入的，可以降低载体酸度，抑制金属上的积碳形成，并提高载体容纳积碳的能力。这表明精心设计的层次孔结构可能在积碳抑制和容纳之间提供平衡。

这些关系意味着最佳催化剂设计应考虑孔径、连通性和均匀性之间的平衡。微孔载体可能因其优越的性能而受到青睐，但引入一些较大的孔或层次结构可能有助于管理积碳累积。目标是设计一种既能抑制初始积碳形成，又能为不可避免的积碳沉积提供足够容量的载体，从而延长催化剂寿命并保持长期性能。
