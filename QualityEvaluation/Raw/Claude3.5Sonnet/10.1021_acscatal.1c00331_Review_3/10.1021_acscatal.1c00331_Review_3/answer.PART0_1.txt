The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Microporous supports generally lead to better selectivity, stability, and lower coke formation compared to mesoporous supports. However, supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, potentially extending catalyst lifetime.

Pore structure modification, such as introducing hierarchical pores in ZSM-5, can decrease support acidity, inhibiting coke formation on the metal and improving the support's capacity for coke. This suggests that tailoring the pore structure can help balance coke formation and accommodation.

These relationships imply that optimal catalyst design should consider a balance between microporous and hierarchical pore structures. Micropores can enhance selectivity and stability while reducing initial coke formation. Simultaneously, incorporating some larger, uniformly distributed, and well-connected pores can improve coke accommodation, potentially extending catalyst lifetime. The goal is to create a support structure that minimizes coke formation on active metal sites while providing sufficient capacity to accommodate unavoidable coke deposits, thereby maintaining catalyst performance over longer periods.

催化剂载体孔结构的特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。与介孔载体相比，微孔载体通常能带来更好的选择性、稳定性和更少的积碳形成。然而，具有更均匀、高度连通和较大孔径的载体可以容纳更多积碳，可能延长催化剂寿命。

孔结构的改性，如在ZSM-5中引入层级孔，可以降低载体酸度，抑制金属上的积碳形成，并提高载体对积碳的容纳能力。这表明调整孔结构可以帮助平衡积碳形成和容纳。

这些关系意味着最佳催化剂设计应考虑微孔和层级孔结构之间的平衡。微孔可以提高选择性和稳定性，同时减少初始积碳形成。同时，引入一些较大、均匀分布和连通性好的孔可以改善积碳容纳能力，可能延长催化剂寿命。目标是创造一种载体结构，能最大限度地减少活性金属位点上的积碳形成，同时提供足够的容量来容纳不可避免的积碳沉积，从而在更长时间内保持催化剂性能。
