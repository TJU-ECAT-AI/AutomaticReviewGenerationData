The given literature does not contain any specific information about the influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, or overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on the regeneration of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts using oxychlorination treatment, but does not discuss details about pore characteristics or their effects on catalyst performance. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in the given literature.
