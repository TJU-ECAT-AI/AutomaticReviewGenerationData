The given literature does not contain any information specifically addressing how characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on the regeneration of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts using oxychlorination treatment, but does not discuss details about pore structures and their effects on catalyst performance or coke formation. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.
