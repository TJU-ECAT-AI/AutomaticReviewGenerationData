[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16)."

[2] "The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."

[3] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

[5] "Therefore, the weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking behaviors."

The literature does not directly address the specific aspects of catalyst support pore structures mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some insights into how different support materials can influence catalyst performance and coke formation in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

The study compared SiO2 and Al2O3 as support materials for PtZn catalysts. SiO2-supported catalysts showed better propane conversion and propylene selectivity. This was attributed to SiO2's weak interaction with metals, which allows for better alloying between Pt and Zn, promoting the formation of intermetallic alloys (IMAs).

Regarding coke formation, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports was found to lead to more coking and catalyst deactivation compared to SiO2. Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts showed that PtZn/SiO2 had significantly lower coke amounts and graphitization degrees than PtZn/Al2O3.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss pore structures, it highlights the importance of support material properties in influencing catalyst performance and coke formation. The weak acidity of SiO2 was found to be beneficial in suppressing coking behaviors.

These findings suggest that when designing optimal catalysts for PDH reactions, consideration should be given to support materials that promote desired metal interactions and minimize coking. While pore structure characteristics were not directly addressed, they likely play a role in these processes and warrant further investigation for optimizing catalyst design.

文献并未直接讨论问题中提到的催化剂载体孔结构的具体方面。然而，它确实提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的催化剂性能和焦炭形成的见解。

研究比较了SiO2和Al2O3作为PtZn催化剂的载体材料。SiO2载体的催化剂显示出更好的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这被归因于SiO2与金属之间的弱相互作用，允许Pt和Zn之间更好的合金化，促进了金属间化合物(IMAs)的形成。

关于焦炭形成，研究发现Al2O3载体的较强酸性导致比SiO2更多的结焦和催化剂失活。对使用过的催化剂进行的拉曼光谱分析显示，PtZn/SiO2的焦炭量和石墨化程度显著低于PtZn/Al2O3。

虽然研究没有明确讨论孔结构，但它强调了载体材料性质在影响催化剂性能和焦炭形成方面的重要性。SiO2的弱酸性被发现有利于抑制结焦行为。

这些发现表明，在设计PDH反应的最佳催化剂时，应考虑使用能促进所需金属相互作用并最小化结焦的载体材料。虽然没有直接讨论孔结构特征，但它们可能在这些过程中发挥作用，值得进一步研究以优化催化剂设计。
