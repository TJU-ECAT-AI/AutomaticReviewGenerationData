[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."

[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

[3] "Therefore, the weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking behaviors."

The literature does not provide detailed information about how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss some general aspects of support influence on catalyst performance and coking:

1. The choice of support material affects catalyst performance. SiO2 support led to better propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Al2O3, despite similar PtZn particle sizes.

2. The weaker metal-support interaction of SiO2 allows for better alloying between Pt and Zn, which is important for the formation of intermetallic alloys (IMAs).

3. Support acidity influences coking behavior. The stronger acidity of Al2O3 compared to SiO2 leads to more coking and faster catalyst deactivation.

4. Raman spectroscopy showed that PtZn/SiO2 had less coke formation and a lower degree of graphitization compared to PtZn/Al2O3.

5. SiO2 was chosen as the support because its weak acidity promotes the formation of highly alloyed PtZn IMA and suppresses coking.

These findings suggest that support characteristics such as metal-support interaction strength and surface acidity play important roles in catalyst performance and coke formation. However, the document does not specifically address pore structure characteristics like pore size, connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements and their effects on PDH reactions.

文献并未提供关于催化剂载体孔结构特性（如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构）如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的详细信息。然而，它确实讨论了载体对催化剂性能和积炭的一些一般影响：

1. 载体材料的选择影响催化剂性能。SiO2载体与Al2O3相比，能够获得更好的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，尽管PtZn粒子大小相似。

2. SiO2较弱的金属-载体相互作用允许Pt和Zn之间更好的合金化，这对于金属间化合物（IMAs）的形成很重要。

3. 载体的酸性影响积炭行为。与SiO2相比，Al2O3的较强酸性导致更多的积炭和更快的催化剂失活。

4. 拉曼光谱显示，PtZn/SiO2比PtZn/Al2O3具有更少的积炭形成和更低程度的石墨化。

5. 选择SiO2作为载体是因为其弱酸性促进了高度合金化PtZn IMA的形成，并抑制了积炭。

这些发现表明，载体特性如金属-载体相互作用强度和表面酸性在催化剂性能和积炭形成中起重要作用。然而，该文档并未具体讨论孔结构特性（如孔径、连通性、均匀性或层次结构）及其对PDH反应的影响。
