[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."

[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

[3] "Therefore, the weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking behaviors."

The literature does not directly discuss how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some insights into how different support materials affect catalyst performance and coking.

The study found that PtZn supported on SiO2 performed better than PtZn on Al2O3 in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity. This was attributed to the weaker interaction between SiO2 and the metals, which allowed for better alloying between Pt and Zn.

Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 compared to SiO2 was found to lead to more coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts showed that PtZn/SiO2 had significantly less coke formation and a lower degree of graphitization compared to PtZn/Al2O3.

These findings suggest that the choice of support material can significantly influence catalyst performance and coking behavior in PDH reactions. The acidity of the support appears to be a crucial factor, with less acidic supports like SiO2 promoting better metal alloying and reducing coke formation. While the study doesn't explicitly discuss pore structures, it implies that the surface properties of the support material play a critical role in determining catalyst effectiveness and stability.

该文献没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能。但是，它确实提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响催化剂性能和积碳的见解。

研究发现，以SiO2为载体的PtZn在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面表现优于以Al2O3为载体的PtZn。这被归因于SiO2与金属之间的相互作用较弱，从而允许Pt和Zn之间更好地合金化。

此外，与SiO2相比，Al2O3的酸性更强，这导致更多的积碳和催化剂失活。对用过的催化剂进行的拉曼光谱分析表明，PtZn/SiO2的积碳形成量明显较少，石墨化程度也低于PtZn/Al2O3。

这些发现表明，载体材料的选择可以显著影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和积碳行为。载体的酸性似乎是一个关键因素，酸性较弱的载体（如SiO2）可以促进更好的金属合金化并减少积碳形成。虽然该研究没有明确讨论孔结构，但它暗示载体材料的表面性质在决定催化剂的有效性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。
