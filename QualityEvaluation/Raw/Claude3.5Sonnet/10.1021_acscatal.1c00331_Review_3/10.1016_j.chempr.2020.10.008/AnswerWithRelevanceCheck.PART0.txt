          [1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."

          [2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

          [3] "Therefore, the weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking behaviors."

          The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it provides insights into how different support materials affect catalyst performance and coking behavior:

          1. Support material chemistry impacts metal-support interactions and alloy formation. SiO2 allows for better metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn compared to Al2O3, leading to improved propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

          2. Support acidity influences coking behavior. The stronger acidity of Al2O3 leads to more coking and catalyst deactivation compared to SiO2. Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts showed that PtZn/SiO2 had significantly less coke formation and a lower degree of graphitization compared to PtZn/Al2O3.

          3. The weak acidity of SiO2 helps suppress coking and promotes the formation of highly alloyed PtZn intermetallic compounds.

          While pore structure characteristics are not explicitly discussed, these findings suggest that support properties play an important role in catalyst performance and coke formation. Optimal catalyst design should consider support materials that facilitate desired metal interactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions like coking. Further research into how specific pore structure parameters influence these processes could provide valuable insights for designing more effective PDH catalysts.

          文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能。但是，它提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响催化剂性能和积碳行为的见解：

          1. 载体材料的化学性质影响金属-载体相互作用和合金形成。与Al2O3相比，SiO2允许Pt和Zn之间更好的金属相互作用和合金化，从而提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

          2. 载体的酸性影响积碳行为。与SiO2相比，Al2O3的较强酸性导致更多的积碳和催化剂失活。对使用过的催化剂进行的拉曼光谱分析表明，PtZn/SiO2的积碳形成量明显较少，石墨化程度也低于PtZn/Al2O3。

          3. SiO2的弱酸性有助于抑制积碳形成，并促进高度合金化的PtZn金属间化合物的形成。

          虽然没有明确讨论孔结构特征，但这些发现表明载体性质在催化剂性能和积碳形成中起着重要作用。最佳催化剂设计应考虑能够促进所需金属相互作用，同时最大限度地减少不需要的副反应（如积碳形成）的载体材料。进一步研究特定孔结构参数如何影响这些过程，可能为设计更有效的PDH催化剂提供宝贵的见解。
