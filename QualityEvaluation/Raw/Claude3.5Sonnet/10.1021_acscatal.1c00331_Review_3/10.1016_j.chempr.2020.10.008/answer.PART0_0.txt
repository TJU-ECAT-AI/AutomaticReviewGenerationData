[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."

[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

[3] "Therefore, the weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking behaviors."

The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some insights into how different support materials affect catalyst performance and coking behavior.

The study found that PtZn supported on SiO2 performed better than PtZn supported on Al2O3 in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity. This was attributed to the weaker interaction between SiO2 and the metals, which allowed for better alloying between Pt and Zn.

Additionally, the acidity of the support material was found to play a role in coking behavior. The stronger acidity of Al2O3 compared to SiO2 led to increased coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts showed that PtZn/SiO2 had significantly less coke formation and a lower degree of graphitization compared to PtZn/Al2O3.

These findings suggest that the choice of support material can significantly impact catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. While the study does not directly address pore structure characteristics, it implies that factors such as metal-support interactions and support acidity are important considerations in designing effective PDH catalysts. Future research could explore how specific pore structure characteristics might further influence these aspects and overall catalyst performance.

虽然文献没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能，但它确实提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响催化剂性能和积碳行为的见解。

研究发现，在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面，负载在SiO2上的PtZn比负载在Al2O3上的PtZn表现更好。这归因于SiO2与金属之间的相互作用较弱，从而允许Pt和Zn之间有更好的合金化。

此外，载体材料的酸性被发现在积碳行为中起着重要作用。与SiO2相比，Al2O3的较强酸性导致了更多的积碳和催化剂失活。对使用过的催化剂进行拉曼光谱分析表明，PtZn/SiO2的积碳形成量明显较少，石墨化程度也较低，相比于PtZn/Al2O3。

这些发现表明，载体材料的选择可以显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和稳定性。虽然研究没有直接讨论孔结构特性，但它暗示了金属-载体相互作用和载体酸性是设计有效PDH催化剂时需要考虑的重要因素。未来的研究可以探索具体的孔结构特性如何进一步影响这些方面和整体催化剂性能。
