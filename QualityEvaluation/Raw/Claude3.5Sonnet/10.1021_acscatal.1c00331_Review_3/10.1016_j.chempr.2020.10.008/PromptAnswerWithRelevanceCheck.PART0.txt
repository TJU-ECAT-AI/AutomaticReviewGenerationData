[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."

[2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

[3] "Therefore, the weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking behaviors."

The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some insights into how different support materials affect catalyst performance and coking behavior.

The study found that PtZn supported on SiO2 performed better than PtZn supported on Al2O3 in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity. This was attributed to the weaker interaction between SiO2 and the metals, which allowed for better alloying between Pt and Zn.

Additionally, the acidity of the support material was found to play a role in coking behavior. The stronger acidity of Al2O3 compared to SiO2 led to increased coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts showed that PtZn/SiO2 had significantly less coke formation and a lower degree of graphitization compared to PtZn/Al2O3.

These findings suggest that the choice of support material can significantly impact catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions. While the study does not directly address pore structure characteristics, it implies that factors such as metal-support interactions and support acidity are important considerations in designing effective PDH catalysts. Future research could explore how specific pore structure characteristics might further influence these aspects and overall catalyst performance.

虽然文献没有直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能，但它确实提供了一些关于不同载体材料如何影响催化剂性能和积碳行为的见解。

研究发现，在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面，负载在SiO2上的PtZn比负载在Al2O3上的PtZn表现更好。这归因于SiO2与金属之间的相互作用较弱，从而允许Pt和Zn之间有更好的合金化。

此外，载体材料的酸性被发现在积碳行为中起着重要作用。与SiO2相比，Al2O3的较强酸性导致了更多的积碳和催化剂失活。对使用过的催化剂进行拉曼光谱分析表明，PtZn/SiO2的积碳形成量明显较少，石墨化程度也较低，相比于PtZn/Al2O3。

这些发现表明，载体材料的选择可以显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能和稳定性。虽然研究没有直接讨论孔结构特性，但它暗示了金属-载体相互作用和载体酸性是设计有效PDH催化剂时需要考虑的重要因素。未来的研究可以探索具体的孔结构特性如何进一步影响这些方面和整体催化剂性能。

The literature does not directly discuss the influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. However, it does provide some insights into how support properties affect catalyst behavior:

1. Support material chemistry impacts metal-support interactions and alloy formation. SiO2 allows for better metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn compared to Al2O3, leading to improved propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

2. Support acidity influences coking behavior. The stronger acidity of Al2O3 leads to more coking and catalyst deactivation compared to SiO2. 

3. The weak acidity of SiO2 helps suppress coking and promotes the formation of highly alloyed PtZn intermetallic compounds.

While pore structure characteristics are not explicitly discussed, these findings suggest that support properties do play an important role in catalyst performance and coke formation. Optimal catalyst design should consider support materials that facilitate desired metal interactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions like coking. Further research into how specific pore structure parameters influence these processes could provide valuable insights for designing more effective PDH catalysts.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于载体性质如何影响催化剂行为的见解：

1. 载体材料的化学性质影响金属-载体相互作用和合金形成。与Al2O3相比，SiO2允许Pt和Zn之间更好的金属相互作用和合金化，从而提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

2. 载体的酸性影响焦炭行为。与SiO2相比，Al2O3的较强酸性导致更多的焦炭形成和催化剂失活。

3. SiO2的弱酸性有助于抑制焦炭形成，并促进高度合金化的PtZn金属间化合物的形成。

虽然没有明确讨论孔结构特征，但这些发现表明载体性质确实在催化剂性能和焦炭形成中起着重要作用。最佳催化剂设计应考虑能够促进所需金属相互作用，同时最大限度地减少不需要的副反应（如焦炭形成）的载体材料。进一步研究特定孔结构参数如何影响这些过程，可能为设计更有效的PDH催化剂提供宝贵的见解。

The literature does not directly address the specific aspects of catalyst support pore structures mentioned in the question. However, it does provide some insights into how different support materials can influence catalyst performance and coke formation in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

The study compared SiO2 and Al2O3 as support materials for PtZn catalysts. SiO2-supported catalysts showed better propane conversion and propylene selectivity. This was attributed to SiO2's weak interaction with metals, which allows for better alloying between Pt and Zn, promoting the formation of intermetallic alloys (IMAs).

Regarding coke formation, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports was found to lead to more coking and catalyst deactivation compared to SiO2. Raman spectroscopy of spent catalysts showed that PtZn/SiO2 had significantly lower coke amounts and graphitization degrees than PtZn/Al2O3.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss pore structures, it highlights the importance of support material properties in influencing catalyst performance and coke formation. The weak acidity of SiO2 was found to be beneficial in suppressing coking behaviors.

These findings suggest that when designing optimal catalysts for PDH reactions, consideration should be given to support materials that promote desired metal interactions and minimize coking. While pore structure characteristics were not directly addressed, they likely play a role in these processes and warrant further investigation for optimizing catalyst design.

The literature does not provide detailed information about how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss some general aspects of support influence on catalyst performance and coking:

1. The choice of support material affects catalyst performance. SiO2 support led to better propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Al2O3, despite similar PtZn particle sizes.

2. The weaker metal-support interaction of SiO2 allows for better alloying between Pt and Zn, which is important for the formation of intermetallic alloys (IMAs).

3. Support acidity influences coking behavior. The stronger acidity of Al2O3 compared to SiO2 leads to more coking and faster catalyst deactivation.

4. Raman spectroscopy showed that PtZn/SiO2 had less coke formation and a lower degree of graphitization compared to PtZn/Al2O3.

5. SiO2 was chosen as the support because its weak acidity promotes the formation of highly alloyed PtZn IMA and suppresses coking.

These findings suggest that support characteristics such as metal-support interaction strength and surface acidity play important roles in catalyst performance and coke formation. However, the document does not specifically address pore structure characteristics like pore size, connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements and their effects on PDH reactions.

文献并未提供关于催化剂载体孔结构特性（如孔径、连通性、均匀性和层次结构）如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的详细信息。然而，它确实讨论了载体对催化剂性能和积炭的一些一般影响：

1. 载体材料的选择影响催化剂性能。SiO2载体与Al2O3相比，能够获得更好的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，尽管PtZn粒子大小相似。

2. SiO2较弱的金属-载体相互作用允许Pt和Zn之间更好的合金化，这对于金属间化合物（IMAs）的形成很重要。

3. 载体的酸性影响积炭行为。与SiO2相比，Al2O3的较强酸性导致更多的积炭和更快的催化剂失活。

4. 拉曼光谱显示，PtZn/SiO2比PtZn/Al2O3具有更少的积炭形成和更低程度的石墨化。

5. 选择SiO2作为载体是因为其弱酸性促进了高度合金化PtZn IMA的形成，并抑制了积炭。

这些发现表明，载体特性如金属-载体相互作用强度和表面酸性在催化剂性能和积炭形成中起重要作用。然而，该文档并未具体讨论孔结构特性（如孔径、连通性、均匀性或层次结构）及其对PDH反应的影响。
