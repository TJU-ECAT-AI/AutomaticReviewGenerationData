[1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorptiondesorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X 0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The coke weight percentage generated during propane dehydrogenation ranged from 2.3 to 9.7. The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

The literature provides limited information on the specific influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relationships can be inferred:

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion rates compared to catalysts with lower surface areas.

2. Pore size seems to be inversely related to surface area, with catalysts having larger pore sizes also exhibiting lower surface areas.

3. There appears to be a correlation between surface area, initial conversion, and coke formation. Catalysts with lower surface areas and lower initial conversion rates (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO) showed lower coke formation after the reaction.

These observations suggest that while higher surface area catalysts may provide better initial performance, they may also be more susceptible to coke formation and subsequent deactivation. The trade-off between high initial activity and resistance to coking should be considered when designing catalysts for PDH reactions.

The study does not provide specific information on pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements. To design optimal and effective catalysts, further research would be needed to investigate how these characteristics influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

该文献对催化剂载体孔结构特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，我们可以推断出一些关系：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。具有较高表面积的催化剂（Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15）表现出较高的初始丙烷转化率。

2. 孔径大小似乎与表面积成反比，具有较大孔径的催化剂也表现出较低的表面积。

3. 表面积、初始转化率和积碳形成之间似乎存在相关性。具有较低表面积和较低初始转化率的催化剂（Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO）在反应后显示出较低的积碳形成。

这些观察结果表明，虽然高表面积催化剂可能提供更好的初始性能，但它们也可能更容易形成积碳并随后失活。在设计PDH反应的催化剂时，应考虑高初始活性和抗积碳性之间的权衡。

该研究没有提供关于孔连通性、均匀性或分层排列的具体信息。为了设计最优和有效的催化剂，需要进一步研究这些特性如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion (>40%) compared to catalysts with lower surface areas (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO), which had lower initial conversion (<20%).

2. Pore size may influence coke formation. Catalysts with larger pore sizes and lower surface areas (Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2) contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction, suggesting that larger pores might accommodate coke better or inhibit its formation.

3. The relationship between surface area, pore size, and coke formation is not straightforward. While higher surface area catalysts showed better initial performance, they also appeared to accumulate more coke during the reaction.

These observations suggest that optimizing catalyst design for PDH reactions involves balancing surface area, pore size, and potentially other factors to maximize initial activity while minimizing coke formation. However, the literature does not provide specific information on the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance or coke formation in PDH reactions.

该文献对催化剂支持体孔结构的特定特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，可以推断出一些关系：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。表面积较高的催化剂(Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15)显示出较高的初始丙烷转化率(>40%)，而表面积较低的催化剂(Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO)的初始转化率较低(<20%)。

2. 孔径可能影响积碳形成。具有较大孔径和较低表面积的催化剂(Pt/CeO2、Pt/MgO和Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2)在反应后含有相对较少的积碳量，这表明较大的孔可能更好地容纳积碳或抑制其形成。

3. 表面积、孔径和积碳形成之间的关系并不简单。虽然表面积较高的催化剂显示出更好的初始性能，但它们在反应过程中似乎也积累了更多的积碳。

这些观察结果表明，为PDH反应优化催化剂设计涉及平衡表面积、孔径和其他潜在因素，以最大化初始活性，同时最小化积碳形成。然而，该文献并未提供有关孔连通性、均匀性或分层排列对PDH反应中催化剂性能或积碳形成影响的具体信息。

These observations suggest that optimizing surface area and pore size could be crucial for designing effective PDH catalysts. Higher surface areas may improve initial catalyst activity, while larger pore sizes might help reduce coke formation. However, the literature does not provide specific information on pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements, so their effects on catalyst performance cannot be determined from this text alone.

To design optimal and effective catalysts, further research would be needed to explore the precise relationships between these pore structure characteristics and catalyst performance, including coke formation and accommodation. This could involve systematic studies varying these parameters and analyzing their impacts on PDH reaction outcomes.

该文献对催化剂载体孔结构的特定特征如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积炭形成和催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，可以推断出一些关系：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。表面积较高的催化剂（Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15）显示出较高的初始转化率（>40%），而表面积较低的催化剂（Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2，Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO）则显示出较低的初始转化率（<20%）。

2. 孔径可能影响积炭形成。孔径较大的催化剂（Pt/CeO2，Pt/MgO和Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2）在反应后表现出较低的积炭量。

3. 初始转化率和积炭形成之间似乎存在反比关系。初始转化率较低的催化剂在反应后往往有较低的积炭量。

这些观察结果表明，优化表面积和孔径对设计有效的PDH催化剂可能至关重要。较高的表面积可能改善催化剂的初始活性，而较大的孔径可能有助于减少积炭形成。然而，该文献没有提供关于孔连通性、均匀性或分级排列的具体信息，因此无法仅从这篇文章确定它们对催化剂性能的影响。

为了设计最佳和有效的催化剂，需要进行进一步研究，探索这些孔结构特征与催化剂性能之间的精确关系，包括积炭形成和容纳。这可能涉及系统地改变这些参数并分析它们对PDH反应结果的影响的研究。
