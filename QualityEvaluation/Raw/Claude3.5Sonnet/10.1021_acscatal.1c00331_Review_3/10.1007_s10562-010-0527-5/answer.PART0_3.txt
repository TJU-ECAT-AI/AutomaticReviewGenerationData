[1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The coke weight percentage generated during propane dehydrogenation ranged from 2.3 to 9.7. The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

The literature provides limited information on how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relationships can be inferred:

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial conversions (>40%) compared to those with lower surface areas (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO), which had lower initial conversions (<20%).

2. Pore size may influence coke formation. Catalysts with larger pore sizes (Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2) exhibited lower coke amounts after the reaction compared to those with smaller pore sizes.

3. There seems to be an inverse relationship between initial conversion and coke formation. Catalysts with lower initial conversions tended to have lower coke amounts after the reaction.

These observations suggest that optimizing surface area and pore size could be crucial for designing effective PDH catalysts. Higher surface areas may improve initial catalyst activity, while larger pore sizes might help reduce coke formation. However, the literature does not provide specific information on pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements, so their effects on catalyst performance cannot be determined from this text alone.

To design optimal and effective catalysts, further research would be needed to explore the precise relationships between these pore structure characteristics and catalyst performance, including coke formation and accommodation. This could involve systematic studies varying these parameters and analyzing their impacts on PDH reaction outcomes.

该文献对催化剂载体孔结构的特定特征如何影响丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积炭形成和催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，可以推断出一些关系：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。表面积较高的催化剂（Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15）显示出较高的初始转化率（>40%），而表面积较低的催化剂（Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2，Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO）则显示出较低的初始转化率（<20%）。

2. 孔径可能影响积炭形成。孔径较大的催化剂（Pt/CeO2，Pt/MgO和Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2）在反应后表现出较低的积炭量。

3. 初始转化率和积炭形成之间似乎存在反比关系。初始转化率较低的催化剂在反应后往往有较低的积炭量。

这些观察结果表明，优化表面积和孔径对设计有效的PDH催化剂可能至关重要。较高的表面积可能改善催化剂的初始活性，而较大的孔径可能有助于减少积炭形成。然而，该文献没有提供关于孔连通性、均匀性或分级排列的具体信息，因此无法仅从这篇文章确定它们对催化剂性能的影响。

为了设计最佳和有效的催化剂，需要进行进一步研究，探索这些孔结构特征与催化剂性能之间的精确关系，包括积炭形成和容纳。这可能涉及系统地改变这些参数并分析它们对PDH反应结果的影响的研究。
