[1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

The literature provides limited information on how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relationships can be inferred:

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion (>40%) compared to catalysts with lower surface areas (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO), which had lower initial conversion (<20%).

2. Pore size may influence coke formation. Catalysts with larger pore sizes and lower surface areas (Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2) contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction, suggesting that larger pores might accommodate coke better or inhibit its formation.

3. The relationship between surface area, pore size, and coke formation is not straightforward. While higher surface area catalysts showed better initial performance, they also appeared to accumulate more coke during the reaction.

These observations suggest that optimizing catalyst design for PDH reactions involves balancing surface area, pore size, and potentially other factors to maximize initial activity while minimizing coke formation. However, the literature does not provide specific information on the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance or coke formation in PDH reactions.

该文献对催化剂支持体孔结构的特定特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，可以推断出一些关系：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。表面积较高的催化剂(Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15)显示出较高的初始丙烷转化率(>40%)，而表面积较低的催化剂(Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO)的初始转化率较低(<20%)。

2. 孔径可能影响积碳形成。具有较大孔径和较低表面积的催化剂(Pt/CeO2、Pt/MgO和Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2)在反应后含有相对较少的积碳量，这表明较大的孔可能更好地容纳积碳或抑制其形成。

3. 表面积、孔径和积碳形成之间的关系并不简单。虽然表面积较高的催化剂显示出更好的初始性能，但它们在反应过程中似乎也积累了更多的积碳。

这些观察结果表明，为PDH反应优化催化剂设计涉及平衡表面积、孔径和其他潜在因素，以最大化初始活性，同时最小化积碳形成。然而，该文献并未提供有关孔连通性、均匀性或分层排列对PDH反应中催化剂性能或积碳形成影响的具体信息。
