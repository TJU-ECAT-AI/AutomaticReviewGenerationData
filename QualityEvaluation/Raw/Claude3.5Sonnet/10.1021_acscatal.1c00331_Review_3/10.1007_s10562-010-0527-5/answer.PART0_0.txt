[1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorptiondesorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X 0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The coke weight percentage generated during propane dehydrogenation ranged from 2.3 to 9.7. The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

The literature provides limited information on the specific influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relationships can be inferred:

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion rates compared to catalysts with lower surface areas.

2. Pore size seems to be inversely related to surface area, with catalysts having larger pore sizes also exhibiting lower surface areas.

3. There appears to be a correlation between surface area, initial conversion, and coke formation. Catalysts with lower surface areas and lower initial conversion rates (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO) showed lower coke formation after the reaction.

These observations suggest that while higher surface area catalysts may provide better initial performance, they may also be more susceptible to coke formation and subsequent deactivation. The trade-off between high initial activity and resistance to coking should be considered when designing catalysts for PDH reactions.

The study does not provide specific information on pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements. To design optimal and effective catalysts, further research would be needed to investigate how these characteristics influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

该文献对催化剂载体孔结构特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，我们可以推断出一些关系：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。具有较高表面积的催化剂（Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15）表现出较高的初始丙烷转化率。

2. 孔径大小似乎与表面积成反比，具有较大孔径的催化剂也表现出较低的表面积。

3. 表面积、初始转化率和积碳形成之间似乎存在相关性。具有较低表面积和较低初始转化率的催化剂（Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO）在反应后显示出较低的积碳形成。

这些观察结果表明，虽然高表面积催化剂可能提供更好的初始性能，但它们也可能更容易形成积碳并随后失活。在设计PDH反应的催化剂时，应考虑高初始活性和抗积碳性之间的权衡。

该研究没有提供关于孔连通性、均匀性或分层排列的具体信息。为了设计最优和有效的催化剂，需要进一步研究这些特性如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。
