[1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorptiondesorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X 0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

The literature provides limited information on how specific catalyst support characteristics influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some general observations can be made:

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial conversion rates compared to those with lower surface areas (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO).

2. Pore size seems to be inversely related to surface area, with catalysts having lower surface areas exhibiting larger pore sizes.

3. Catalysts with lower initial conversions (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO) tended to accumulate less coke during the reaction.

These observations suggest that there may be a trade-off between initial catalyst activity and coke formation. Higher surface area catalysts may provide more active sites for the reaction, leading to higher initial conversion rates. However, they may also be more susceptible to coke formation and subsequent deactivation.

The study does not provide direct information on pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements. To design optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions, further research would be needed to investigate how these specific pore structure characteristics influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance. Such studies could help in developing catalysts that balance high activity with resistance to coking and improved stability over time.

该文献对催化剂支持体特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，可以得出一些一般性观察：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。具有较高表面积的催化剂（Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15）显示出较高的初始转化率，而较低表面积的催化剂（Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO）则相对较低。

2. 孔径似乎与表面积呈反比关系，表面积较低的催化剂表现出较大的孔径。

3. 初始转化率较低的催化剂（Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO）在反应过程中积碳量较少。

这些观察结果表明，催化剂的初始活性和积碳形成之间可能存在权衡关系。较高表面积的催化剂可能为反应提供更多的活性位点，导致较高的初始转化率。然而，它们可能也更容易形成积碳并随之失活。

该研究并未直接提供关于孔隙连通性、均匀性或分层排列的信息。为了设计最佳和有效的PDH反应催化剂，需要进一步研究这些特定的孔结构特征如何影响积碳形成、容纳能力和整体催化剂性能。这些研究可能有助于开发在高活性、抗积碳性和长期稳定性之间取得平衡的催化剂。
