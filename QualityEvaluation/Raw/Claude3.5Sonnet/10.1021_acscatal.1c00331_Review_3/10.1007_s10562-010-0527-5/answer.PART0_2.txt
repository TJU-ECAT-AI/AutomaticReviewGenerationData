[1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The coke weight percentage generated during propane dehydrogenation ranged from 2.3 to 9.7. The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

The literature provides limited information on how specific pore structure characteristics influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some general observations can be made:

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial conversion rates compared to those with lower surface areas (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO).

2. Pore size seems to be inversely related to surface area, with catalysts having larger pore sizes also exhibiting lower surface areas.

3. There appears to be a correlation between initial conversion rates and coke formation. Catalysts with lower initial conversion rates (which also had lower surface areas and larger pore sizes) tended to accumulate less coke during the reaction.

These observations suggest that catalyst support characteristics do influence both catalyst performance and coke formation in PDH reactions. However, the study does not provide detailed information on the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements. To design optimal catalysts, further research would be needed to explore how these specific pore structure characteristics affect coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

文献对于孔结构特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。但是，可以得出一些一般性观察：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。表面积较高的催化剂(Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15)表现出较高的初始转化率，而表面积较低的催化剂(Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO)则表现出较低的初始转化率。

2. 孔径似乎与表面积呈反比关系，孔径较大的催化剂也表现出较低的表面积。

3. 初始转化率和积碳形成之间似乎存在相关性。初始转化率较低的催化剂(同时具有较低的表面积和较大的孔径)在反应过程中积累的焦炭较少。

这些观察结果表明，催化剂载体特性确实影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和积碳形成。然而，该研究并未提供关于孔连通性、均匀性或分级排列效应的详细信息。为了设计最优催化剂，需要进一步研究这些特定的孔结构特征如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成和催化剂性能。
