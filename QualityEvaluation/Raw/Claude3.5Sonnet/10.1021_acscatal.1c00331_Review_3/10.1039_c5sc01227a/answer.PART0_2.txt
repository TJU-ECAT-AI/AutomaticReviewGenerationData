The given literature does not contain any specific information about the influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses mainly on the dehydrogenation mechanisms on metal surfaces, oxides, zeolites, and single atom catalysts, but does not discuss in detail the effects of support pore characteristics. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately answer this question about the relationships between pore structures and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.
