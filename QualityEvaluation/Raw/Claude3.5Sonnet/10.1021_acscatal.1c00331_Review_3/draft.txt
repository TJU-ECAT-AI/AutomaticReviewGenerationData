1. The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, with implications for optimal catalyst design.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. This comprehensive review analyzes the impact of various pore structure characteristics on PDH catalyst performance and provides insights for optimal catalyst design.

1. Pore Size:
Pore size plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance and coke formation. Smaller pores generally lead to higher propane conversion and catalytic activity, with the order of activity decreasing with increasing pore size: ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15 [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. However, the relationship between pore size and coke formation is complex. While smaller pores can limit coke formation, they are also more susceptible to blockage [10.1002/aic.16410]. Studies have shown that coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size, as demonstrated by varying coke amounts observed on different catalysts [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

2. Pore Connectivity and Uniformity:
Three-dimensional microporous materials (e.g., ZSM-5 and Beta) generally outperform one-dimensional mesoporous materials (e.g., SBA-15) in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. This suggests that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions and provide improved accessibility to active sites. Uniformity in pore structure contributes to shape-selectivity effects, which can influence product distribution and coke formation [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

3. Hierarchical Arrangements:
Hierarchical pore structures, combining micropores and mesopores, have shown great promise in enhancing catalyst performance. For example, the introduction of hierarchical pores in ZSM-5 zeolite (ZQ) significantly improved the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke while maintaining high activity [10.1002/jctb.4686]. These structures typically include smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface, which enhance mass transfer and diffusion kinetics [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286].

4. Surface Area and Pore Volume:
High surface area and pore volume generally contribute to better catalyst performance. Catalysts with higher surface areas (e.g., Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion rates compared to those with lower surface areas [10.1007/s10562-010-0527-5]. However, this must be balanced with other factors, as high surface area catalysts may also be more susceptible to coke formation and subsequent deactivation.

5. Support Composition and Acidity:
The chemical nature of the support material significantly influences catalyst performance and coke formation. For instance, SiO2 supports allowed for better metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn compared to Al2O3, leading to improved propane conversion and propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. The acidity of the support also plays a crucial role, with stronger acidity generally leading to increased coke formation [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

6. Coke Formation and Accommodation:
The pore structure significantly affects the catalyst's ability to form, accommodate, and resist coke. Supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, potentially extending catalyst lifetime [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_3]. However, the relationship is complex, as demonstrated by the observation that Pt-ZSM-5 (smallest pores) showed the highest coke formation, while Pt-Beta had the lowest [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

7. Metal Dispersion and Stability:
The pore structure influences metal dispersion and stability, which in turn affect catalyst performance and coke formation. Hierarchical pore structures can inhibit the agglomeration of metal particles during reactions, contributing to improved catalyst stability [10.1002/jctb.4686]. Additionally, the confinement effect of zeolite structures allows for the generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species, which can enhance catalytic performance [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7].

Implications for Optimal Catalyst Design:
Based on these findings, several strategies can be employed to design optimal PDH catalysts:

1. Develop supports with hierarchical pore structures that combine the benefits of micropores (high surface area, shape selectivity) and mesopores (improved mass transfer, coke accommodation).
2. Optimize pore size distribution to balance metal dispersion, reactant/product diffusion, and coke resistance.
3. Utilize three-dimensional pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact and accessibility to active sites.
4. Consider the interplay between pore structure and surface acidity to achieve desired catalytic performance and coke resistance.
5. Design pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions while facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites.
6. Explore novel support materials and compositions that can further enhance metal-support interactions and coke resistance.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structures in PDH reactions reveals the intricate interplay between various structural characteristics and their impact on catalyst performance. Moving forward, research efforts should focus on developing advanced hierarchical pore structures that can synergistically combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities. This may involve exploring novel synthesis methods, such as templating techniques or post-synthetic modifications, to create tailored pore architectures.

Future research directions could include:

1. Investigation of multi-scale hierarchical structures that incorporate micro-, meso-, and macropores in a controlled manner to optimize mass transfer, active site accessibility, and coke resistance.
2. Development of dynamic pore structures that can adapt to reaction conditions, potentially through the use of responsive materials or in-situ pore modification techniques.
3. Exploration of advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy and tomography, to gain deeper insights into the evolution of pore structures during PDH reactions and coke formation processes.
4. Integration of computational modeling and machine learning approaches to predict optimal pore structures for specific reaction conditions and desired performance characteristics.
5. Investigation of the potential of novel support materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which offer highly tunable pore structures and chemical functionalities.

By addressing these research avenues, the field can move towards the development of next-generation PDH catalysts with enhanced performance, longer lifetimes, and improved sustainability.
