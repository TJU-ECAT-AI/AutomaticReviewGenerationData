[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials"

[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."

[3] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."

[4] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

[5] "The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules."

The study reveals several important relationships between catalyst support pore structures and performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores generally lead to higher activity, with the order of activity being ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15. This suggests that smaller pores provide better contact between reactants and active sites.

2. Connectivity: Three-dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5 and Beta) perform better than one-dimensional mesoporous materials (SBA-15). This indicates that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions.

3. Uniformity: While not explicitly discussed, the uniform microporous structure of zeolites appears to contribute to their superior performance compared to the larger, less uniform pores of SBA-15.

4. Coke formation and accommodation: Interestingly, the catalyst with the smallest pores (Pt-ZSM-5) showed the highest coke formation, while Pt-Beta had the lowest. This suggests that pore size alone does not determine coke formation and that other factors like pore connectivity and shape selectivity play important roles.

5. Overall catalyst performance: Three-dimensional microporous materials (zeolites) outperform mesoporous materials in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. This is attributed to their intrinsic properties such as cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small three-dimensional pores.

These findings imply that optimal PDH catalysts should have well-connected, three-dimensional microporous structures with carefully tuned pore sizes. The pores should be small enough to enhance reactant-catalyst contact but not so small as to promote excessive coking. Additionally, the incorporation of shape-selective properties and cation exchange sites can further enhance catalyst performance. Designers should aim for a balance between activity, selectivity, and coke resistance when optimizing pore structures for PDH catalysts.

该研究揭示了催化剂支撑孔结构与丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应性能之间的几个重要关系：

1. 孔径大小：较小的孔径通常会导致更高的活性，活性顺序为ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15。这表明较小的孔径可以提供反应物与活性位点之间更好的接触。

2. 连通性：三维微孔材料（ZSM-5和Beta）的性能优于一维介孔材料（SBA-15）。这表明互连的孔网络可以促进反应物与催化剂之间更好的相互作用。

3. 均一性：虽然没有明确讨论，但沸石的均匀微孔结构似乎比SBA-15的较大、较不均匀的孔隙结构贡献更多的优异性能。

4. 积碳形成和容纳：有趣的是，具有最小孔径的催化剂（Pt-ZSM-5）显示出最高的积碳形成，而Pt-Beta的积碳形成最低。这表明孔径大小并不是决定积碳形成的唯一因素，其他因素如孔隙连通性和形状选择性也起着重要作用。

5. 整体催化剂性能：三维微孔材料（沸石）在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于介孔材料。这归因于它们的固有特性，如阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小型三维孔。

这些发现意味着最佳PDH催化剂应具有连接良好的三维微孔结构，并具有精心调节的孔径大小。孔径应足够小以增强反应物-催化剂接触，但又不能小到促进过度积碳。此外，形状选择性和阳离子交换位点的引入可以进一步提高催化剂性能。设计者在优化PDH催化剂的孔结构时，应该在活性、选择性和抗积碳性之间寻求平衡。
