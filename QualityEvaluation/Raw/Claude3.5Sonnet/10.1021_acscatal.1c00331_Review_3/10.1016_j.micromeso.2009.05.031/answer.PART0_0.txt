[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials"

[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."

[3] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."

[4] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

[5] "The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules."

The study provides several insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores generally lead to higher propane conversion. Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores showed the highest activity, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 with larger pores.

2. Pore connectivity: Three-dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5 and Beta) performed better than the mesoporous SBA-15, suggesting that interconnected pore networks are beneficial for catalytic activity.

3. Coke formation and accommodation: Pt-ZSM-5 formed the most coke, while Pt-Beta formed the least. However, Pt-Beta showed better catalytic stability, indicating that the pore structure of Beta better accommodates coke without significant loss of activity.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: The study did not directly address hierarchical pore structures, but the comparison between microporous and mesoporous materials suggests that a combination of different pore sizes could potentially optimize catalyst performance.

5. Uniformity: The study did not explicitly discuss pore uniformity, but the superior performance of zeolites (ZSM-5 and Beta) with well-defined, uniform pore structures suggests that uniformity may play a role in catalyst effectiveness.

The implications for designing optimal catalysts include:

1. Utilizing microporous materials with three-dimensional pore networks to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. Balancing pore size to optimize propane conversion while minimizing coke formation.
3. Considering the incorporation of cation exchange sites and shape-selective effects in the catalyst design.
4. Potentially developing hierarchical pore structures that combine the benefits of both microporous and mesoporous materials.

该研究对催化剂支撑孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能提供了几个见解：

1. 孔径：较小的孔径通常导致更高的丙烷转化率。具有最小孔径的Pt-ZSM-5显示出最高的活性，其次是具有较大孔径的Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15。

2. 孔连通性：三维微孔材料（ZSM-5和Beta）的性能优于介孔SBA-15，表明相互连接的孔网络有利于催化活性。

3. 积碳形成和容纳：Pt-ZSM-5形成的积碳最多，而Pt-Beta形成的积碳最少。然而，Pt-Beta显示出更好的催化稳定性，表明Beta的孔结构能更好地容纳积碳而不会显著损失活性。

4. 层级排列：该研究没有直接涉及层级孔结构，但微孔和介孔材料的比较表明，不同孔径的组合可能会优化催化剂性能。

5. 均匀性：该研究没有明确讨论孔均匀性，但具有明确定义的均匀孔结构的沸石（ZSM-5和Beta）性能优越，这表明均匀性可能在催化剂效果中起作用。

对设计最佳催化剂的启示包括：

1. 利用具有三维孔网络的微孔材料来增强催化活性和选择性。
2. 平衡孔径大小，以优化丙烷转化率同时最小化积碳形成。
3. 在催化剂设计中考虑纳入阳离子交换位点和形状选择效应。
4. 可能开发结合微孔和介孔材料优点的层级孔结构。
