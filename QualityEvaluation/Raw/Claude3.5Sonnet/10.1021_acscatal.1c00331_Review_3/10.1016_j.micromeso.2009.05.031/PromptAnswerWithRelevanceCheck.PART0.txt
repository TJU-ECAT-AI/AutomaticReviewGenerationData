[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials"

[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."

[3] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."

[4] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

[5] "The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules."

The study provides several insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores generally lead to higher propane conversion. Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores showed the highest activity, followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 with larger pores.

2. Pore connectivity: Three-dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5 and Beta) performed better than the mesoporous SBA-15, suggesting that interconnected pore networks are beneficial for catalytic activity.

3. Coke formation and accommodation: Pt-ZSM-5 formed the most coke, while Pt-Beta formed the least. However, Pt-Beta showed better catalytic stability, indicating that the pore structure of Beta better accommodates coke without significant loss of activity.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: The study did not directly address hierarchical pore structures, but the comparison between microporous and mesoporous materials suggests that a combination of different pore sizes could potentially optimize catalyst performance.

5. Uniformity: The study did not explicitly discuss pore uniformity, but the superior performance of zeolites (ZSM-5 and Beta) with well-defined, uniform pore structures suggests that uniformity may play a role in catalyst effectiveness.

The implications for designing optimal catalysts include:

1. Utilizing microporous materials with three-dimensional pore networks to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. Balancing pore size to optimize propane conversion while minimizing coke formation.
3. Considering the incorporation of cation exchange sites and shape-selective effects in the catalyst design.
4. Potentially developing hierarchical pore structures that combine the benefits of both microporous and mesoporous materials.

该研究对催化剂支撑孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能提供了几个见解：

1. 孔径：较小的孔径通常导致更高的丙烷转化率。具有最小孔径的Pt-ZSM-5显示出最高的活性，其次是具有较大孔径的Pt-Beta和Pt-SBA-15。

2. 孔连通性：三维微孔材料（ZSM-5和Beta）的性能优于介孔SBA-15，表明相互连接的孔网络有利于催化活性。

3. 积碳形成和容纳：Pt-ZSM-5形成的积碳最多，而Pt-Beta形成的积碳最少。然而，Pt-Beta显示出更好的催化稳定性，表明Beta的孔结构能更好地容纳积碳而不会显著损失活性。

4. 层级排列：该研究没有直接涉及层级孔结构，但微孔和介孔材料的比较表明，不同孔径的组合可能会优化催化剂性能。

5. 均匀性：该研究没有明确讨论孔均匀性，但具有明确定义的均匀孔结构的沸石（ZSM-5和Beta）性能优越，这表明均匀性可能在催化剂效果中起作用。

对设计最佳催化剂的启示包括：

1. 利用具有三维孔网络的微孔材料来增强催化活性和选择性。
2. 平衡孔径大小，以优化丙烷转化率同时最小化积碳形成。
3. 在催化剂设计中考虑纳入阳离子交换位点和形状选择效应。

The study reveals several important relationships between catalyst support pore structures and performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores generally lead to higher activity, with the order of activity being ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15. This suggests that smaller pores provide better contact between reactants and active sites.

2. Connectivity: Three-dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5 and Beta) perform better than one-dimensional mesoporous materials (SBA-15). This indicates that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions.

3. Uniformity: While not explicitly discussed, the uniform microporous structure of zeolites appears to contribute to their superior performance compared to the larger, less uniform pores of SBA-15.

4. Coke formation and accommodation: Interestingly, the catalyst with the smallest pores (Pt-ZSM-5) showed the highest coke formation, while Pt-Beta had the lowest. This suggests that pore size alone does not determine coke formation and that other factors like pore connectivity and shape selectivity play important roles.

5. Overall catalyst performance: Three-dimensional microporous materials (zeolites) outperform mesoporous materials in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. This is attributed to their intrinsic properties such as cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small three-dimensional pores.

These findings imply that optimal PDH catalysts should have well-connected, three-dimensional microporous structures with carefully tuned pore sizes. The pores should be small enough to enhance reactant-catalyst contact but not so small as to promote excessive coking. Additionally, the incorporation of shape-selective properties and cation exchange sites can further enhance catalyst performance. Designers should aim for a balance between activity, selectivity, and coke resistance when optimizing pore structures for PDH catalysts.

该研究揭示了催化剂支撑孔结构与丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应性能之间的几个重要关系：

1. 孔径大小：较小的孔径通常会导致更高的活性，活性顺序为ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15。这表明较小的孔径可以提供反应物与活性位点之间更好的接触。

2. 连通性：三维微孔材料（ZSM-5和Beta）的性能优于一维介孔材料（SBA-15）。这表明互连的孔网络可以促进反应物与催化剂之间更好的相互作用。

3. 均一性：虽然没有明确讨论，但沸石的均匀微孔结构似乎比SBA-15的较大、较不均匀的孔隙结构贡献更多的优异性能。

4. 积碳形成和容纳：有趣的是，具有最小孔径的催化剂（Pt-ZSM-5）显示出最高的积碳形成，而Pt-Beta的积碳形成最低。这表明孔径大小并不是决定积碳形成的唯一因素，其他因素如孔隙连通性和形状选择性也起着重要作用。

5. 整体催化剂性能：三维微孔材料（沸石）在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于介孔材料。这归因于它们的固有特性，如阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小型三维孔。

这些发现意味着最佳PDH催化剂应具有连接良好的三维微孔结构，并具有精心调节的孔径大小。孔径应足够小以增强反应物-催化剂接触，但又不能小到促进过度积碳。此外，形状选择性和阳离子交换位点的引入可以进一步提高催化剂性能。设计者在优化PDH催化剂的孔结构时，应该在活性、选择性和抗积碳性之间寻求平衡。

[1] "Pt-ZSM-5 containing the smallest pores among the catalysts studied in this work shows considerably higher C3H8 conversion during the reaction followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15"

[2] "The amount of coke content after 170 min on-stream was measured to be the highest on Pt-ZSM-5, as expected, followed by, though surprising, on Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Beta"

[3] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc., which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Whilst, these side reactions may not be significant under these experimental conditions on support Beta."

[4] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation exchange sites and might be complemented by their three dimensional pore geometry."

[5] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may have lead to its lower catalytic performance."

The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores (as in ZSM-5) lead to higher propane conversion but also more coke formation. Larger pores (as in SBA-15) result in lower conversion and intermediate coke formation.

2. Connectivity: Three-dimensional pore networks (as in zeolites) provide better catalytic performance compared to one-dimensional cylindrical pores (as in SBA-15).

3. Uniformity: Uniform microporous structures (zeolites) show superior performance compared to mesoporous materials (SBA-15).

4. Hierarchical arrangements: The presence of cation exchange sites in zeolites, combined with their three-dimensional pore geometry, contributes to better catalytic performance.

These relationships imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus on:

1. Balancing pore size to maximize conversion while minimizing coke formation.
2. Utilizing three-dimensional pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact.
3. Incorporating uniform microporous structures with cation exchange sites.
4. Developing hierarchical pore arrangements that combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities.
