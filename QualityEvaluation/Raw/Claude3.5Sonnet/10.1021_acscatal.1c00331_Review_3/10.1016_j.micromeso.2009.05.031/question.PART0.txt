The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activ-
ity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and
Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM)
reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously. The catalysts were prepared
by incipient wetness impregnation and were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and H2-chemisorption. The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the
pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore
geometries (structure and size). This allowed to (i) largely marginalize the effect of the sizes of Pt parti-
cles on DHP and (ii) evaluate exclusively the vital role of pore geometry of the supports, where a fraction
of Pt is located within the pores, on the catalytic performance. Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane
conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore
size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support. TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed dur-
ing DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic
stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15. Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selec-
tivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content. These observations demonstrate that the
three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-
15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites.

1. Introduction
Light alkenes such as propylene are important building blocks
in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications thus, their demand is
high [1,2]. A great deal of attention has been paid to so-called
on-purpose propylene production technologies, such as dehydroge-
nation of propane (DHP) [37], due to their potential to make-up
the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers
where propylene is produced as a by-product [810]. Due to ther-
modynamic constrains of DHP reaction, usually high temperatures
and low pressures are required for reasonable propane conversion
[6,7,11,12]. Under these experimental conditions, dehydrogenation
catalysts suffer severely from coke formation that leads to catalyst
deactivation [6,7]. Therefore, many studies are dedicated to devel-
op dehydrogenation catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reac-
tion while diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking
and coking and thus improving catalyst stability.
Promoted Pt based catalysts reportedly exhibit superior DHP
activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability than their
counter un-promoted catalysts [7,1317]. Consequently, a variety
of catalysts in which Pt was supported on various carriers (e.g.,
Al2O3, SiO2, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, MFI, Beta, MOR, MEL, SBA-15,
MgAl(O), CIT6) and promoted with an electropositive metal such
as Sn, Zn, Na, etc., were studied in an effort to find an optimum cat-
alyst [1323]. In particular, zeolite based Pt catalysts were re-
ported to be much more active, selective and stable for DHP than
the classical Al2O3 or SiO2 based [1621]. For instance, Pt/Na
[Fe]-ZSM-5 showed unprecedented site activity, selectivity and
stability in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation than classical
PtSnAl2O3 and zeolite based catalyst PtSnKL [19,20]. On the
other hand, a very recent study on the catalytic dehydrogenation
of propane over Pt and PtZn containing zeolites concluded that
zeolite Beta followed by zeolite MOR are more active, selective
and stable than the other zeolites (ZSM-5, ZSM-11, Y and L) [21].
The contradictory observations on DHP performance of different
framework zeolites could be ascribed to different catalyst compo-
sitions, Si/Al ratios, feed compositions, etc. [1621]. However, re-
cently we have demonstrated that the size of Pt particle is
crucial in determining the DHP activity, selectivity, the degree of
coke formation and thus the stability of the catalyst [6]. There

are no studies as such on the role of the pore geometry (pore struc-
ture and size) of different framework materials on DHP which take
into account of the Pt particle size. This study aims to comprehend
the intrinsic influence of the pore geometry of micro and mesopor-
ous materials that contain Pt particles, essentially of the same size,
besides isolated species on the catalytic performance.
In this work, ZSM-5 and Beta that have shown better DHP
performance among the other catalysts reported in the literature
[1823] are compared with SBA-15 which posses different pore
geometry than that of the former two. Moreover, Cr-SBA-15 has
got a great deal of attention due to its attractive DHP and ODHP
with CO2 activity [4,10]. Therefore, ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15 which
provide distinct pore geometries were employed for this study. For
example, zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta exhibit multidirectional channel
systems. The former consists of three dimensional/10MR channel
system
with
pore
dimensions
of
0.53  0.56 nm
and
0.51  0.55 nm, while Beta presents three dimensional/12MR
channel system with 0.66  0.67 nm and 0.56  0.57 nm [2426].
Differently, SBA-15 consists of parallel channels with a tunable
pore size distribution in the range, e.g., from 5 to 30 nm [26,27].
Accordingly, the size of pores in the supports increases in the fol-
lowing order: ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15. Moreover, zeolites employed
in the present study contain much lower amounts of alumina
(Si/Al  300) as compared to that in previous studies (e.g., Si/Al
of 55 and 12 in ZSM-5 and Beta, respectively) [1518,21,23], which
greatly reduces the role of acidic sites on the catalytic performance.
This allows us to principally and systematically assess the intrinsic
influence of pore geometry of the support materials on DHP. A ta-
pered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor coupled to
on-line gas chromatography (GC) was used to derive comprehen-
sive data (i.e., activity, selectivity and the degree of coke formation)
from a single catalysis experiment. Probably for the first time by
TEOM reactor, we provide direct evidence on the influence of pore
geometry of the supports ZSM-5, Beta and SBA-15 on DHP activity,
selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
The parent siliceous SBA-15 was prepared according to the pro-
cedure reported in the literature [4,6,26,27]. NH4-ZSM-5 and NH4-
Beta zeolites were kindly provided by PQ corporation, PA, USA. The
zeolites were transformed to H form by calcination at 773 K
for 6 h.
Monometallic Pt catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation. Impregnation solutions were prepared by dissolving
appropriate amounts of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (JohnsonMatthey/Aesar)
in double deionised water. The resulting solution was added drop-
wise to the support material, which had been pretreated in an oven
at 373 K for 16 h. After impregnation with the metal, the samples
were dried at 373 K for 16 h and subsequently calcined in flowing
air at 673 K for 4 h. The composition and textural properties of the
supports and the catalysts are presented in Table 1.
2.2. Characterization techniques
Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K were ob-
tained on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Prior to the
experiments, the samples were evacuated at 473 K for 12 h. The to-
tal surface area of the samples was determined by the Brunauer
EmmettTeller (BET) method. The pore size distributions were
obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the
Broekhoffde Boer (BdB) model [28].
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples
were collected by a Siemens D-5005 instrument using Cu Ka
radiation (k = 1.542 Å). XRD data were collected in the 2h range
of 2090 using a step size of 0.04 and a step time of 21 s. The
average Pt particle size was calculated from the full width at
half-maximum (FWHM) of Pt(1 1 1) reflection using the Scherrer
equation (Table 2).
The Pt dispersion was determined by H2-chemisorption mea-
surements using Micromeritics ASAP2010 Chemi instrument.
Reversible isotherms were measured with an interim 30 min evac-
uation between isotherms. Samples were reduced in a flow of H2 at
673 K for 4 h followed by evacuation at 473 K for 30 min and
cooled to room temperature. At this temperature, samples were
once again evacuated for 15 min and H2-chemisorption experi-
ments were performed. The amount of adsorbed hydrogen was
determined by extrapolating the isotherms to zero pressure. The
dispersion was determined based on the irreversible uptakes and
using an adsorption stoichiometry of unity of hydrogen and plati-
num. Hemispherical particle sizes were determined from d
(nm) = 1.13/D, where D is the metallic dispersion (Table 2).
2.3. Activity studies by tapered element oscillating microbalance
(TEOM)
The activity, selectivity and the degree of coke formation of the
catalysts were simultaneously studied by TEOM which is coupled
with on-line GC. To this end, the TEOM (Series 1500 PMA, Ruppr-
echt and Patashnick Co.) with a high resolution microbalance that
generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gasso-
lid reactions was employed [5,6]. The detailed description of the
equipment is reported elsewhere [29]. Gas flows, temperatures,
TEOM operation and data collection were controlled using Lab-
View software.
The TEOM reactor was loaded with 30 mg of catalyst (sieve frac-
tion 250 lm), firmly packed between two plugs of quartz wool
and retained there by a ventilated metal cap. Prior to the experi-
ments the catalysts were pre-treated in flowing H2 (20 ml min1)
at the reaction temperature (793 K) for 4 h, by when a stable base-
line was reached. H2 was replaced by the DHP reaction mixture of
C3H8
(8 vol.%) and
H2 (13 vol.%) in He
at a total flow of

150 ml min1. The reaction mixture was preheated at 723 K in the
preheating zone, before entering onto the catalyst bed. A purge gas
(He) flow of 200 ml min1 was used. The space velocity (SV) was
calculated as gpropane  gcat
1  h1 and was 47 h1. The coke con-
tent was determined from the mass change measured during reac-
tion. The product gases were analyzed by on-line GC (HP 5890)
equipped with a FID, using GS-Q column (30 m length and
0.543 mm i.d., allowing the separation of hydrocarbons up to C3)
and controlled by HP ChemStation software. The products selectiv-
ity was calculated on the basis of carbon. The reaction rates (r),
mole propane gCat

tial conditions in the catalyst bed. Initial reaction rates (r0) were
determined by plotting the reaction rate (r) against the coke con-
tent on the catalyst and thereby extrapolating to zero coke content
[29] according to the Eq. (1):

where C is the coke content in wt.% and a is a deactivation constant.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The chemical composition and textural properties of the sam-
ples are compared in Table 1. The N2 adsorptiondesorption
isotherms of Pt catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The isotherms of
Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta show high nitrogen uptakes at low relative
pressures and a plateau at high relative pressures, typical for
microporous materials (type I according to IUPAC classification),
as compared to the isotherm of Pt-SBA-15 [24,26,30]. The sub-step
observed at around p/p0 = 0.2 in the isotherm of Pt-ZSM-5 is a typ-
ical feature of MFI type zeolites and is associated with a fluid to so-
lid like phase transition of the adsorbed N2 in the microporous
network [24,26]. Pt-SBA-15 shows the characteristic behaviour of
the ordered mesoporous materials exhibiting an irreversible type
IV isotherm with a well-defined hysteresis loop of type H1 at
p/p0 > 0.66 [4,26,29,31]. This type of hysteresis loop is associated
with capillary condensation and desorption in open ended cylin-
drical mesopores [26,29,31]. The pore size distribution of Pt-SBA-
15 as well as of Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta determined by the BdB
model applied to the desorption branch of the isotherms is typical
for such materials [24,29,32]. As expected, the total BET surface
area of the catalysts decreased after platinum loading onto the
supports as compared to pristine supports indicating that some
of the platinum may have located inside the pores, for example
as isolated sites (Table 1).
The XRD powder diffraction patterns of the catalysts were mea-
sured to analyze the crystal structure of the supports and to assess
the distribution of platinum metal in the catalysts (Fig. 2). It is evi-
dent from diffraction patterns of Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta that the
crystal structure of the zeolites is maintained after platinum load-
ing [2426]. Diffractogram of Pt-SBA-15 shows broad maxima at 2h
of 23.5o which is typical of amorphous silica [4,26,29,33]. Beside
the characteristic XRD patterns of the support materials, the XRD
reflections of large Pt particles for the three catalysts were also ob-
served at around 2h of 39.8o, 46.2o, 67.4o and 81.4o which can be
attributed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) inter planar spac-
ings of the cubic Pt metal structure, respectively [6,29,33]. The
average Pt particle size in the catalysts was determined from the
full width half-maximum (FWHM) of Pt (1 1 1) peak (Table 2)
and it appears that it is larger in Pt-ZSM-5 than that in Pt-Beta
and Pt-SBA-15. However, it is similar in the latter two catalysts.
This is indeed surprising considering the nature and pore size dis-
tribution of the supports. Given the nature of support zeolites,
identical Pt content, method of preparation and pre-treatment pro-
cedures, a similar Pt distribution could be expected in Pt-ZSM-5
and Pt-Beta rather than that in Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15. The dispar-
ity in the average size of Pt particles could be within the limits of
accuracy of the method used for the determination. Based on the
above, a similar Pt distribution could be expected in Pt-ZSM-5
and Pt-Beta without ruling out the possibility of a fraction of large
Pt particles in the range of 24 nm in Pt-ZSM-5. The distribution of

Pt in the catalysts was further investigated by H2-chemisorption
measurements.
The average Pt particle sizes determined by H2-chemisorption
in Pt-ZSM-5, Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 are similar (26 nm) indicat-
ing that the dispersion of Pt in the catalysts is essentially the same
(Table 2). However, the average Pt particle size determined by H2-
chemisorption is larger than that by XRD as shown in Table 2 and
has often been observed by several other researchers [6,7,14,3335].
Despite that, the technique is an important and frequently used
tool to determine Pt dispersion and surface site activity. A plausible
reason for the larger average Pt size determined by H2-chemisorp-
tion could be due to the interactions between particles and the
support [6,7,14,3335].
In summary, N2-physisorption data revealed that even after
platinum loading and subsequent pre-treatments (drying and cal-
cination) the structure of micro (ZSM-5 and Beta) and mesoporous
(SBA-15) materials is essentially the same, which is further con-
firmed by XRD powder patterns of the catalysts. However in the
catalysts, a fraction of Pt is occupied within the pores, perhaps as
isolated sites and small nano particles as reported in [13,19,20],
of the supports as evidenced by their decreased surface area as
compared to that of the corresponding pristine materials (Table 1).
It is also evident from N2-physisorption data (Table 1), and is well
known, that the size of the pores in Pt-ZSM-5 is smaller than those
in Pt-Beta while, Pt-SBA-15 contains larger pores than that of the
two Pt-zeolites. The XRD and H2-chemisorption data suggest that
the average size of Pt particles in the catalysts is comparable.
Therefore the surface site heterogeneity (i.e., the fraction of coord-
inatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms, for example at edges, steps,
terraces, etc.) of Pt nanoparticles in the catalysts is expected to be
essentially the same [6,29,33,36] and thus similar DHP activity of
surface Pt atoms in the particles. Moreover, taking account of the
pore diameter of the supports as evidenced by N2-physisorption
(Table 1) and the size of Pt particles as evidenced by XRD and
H2-chemisorption (Table 2), it can be suggested that the Pt nano-
particles are located outside the pores (Fig. 2). The similar size
and location of Pt particles in the catalysts implies that their effect
on DHP performance may be marginalized [6]. On the other hand,
the presence of Pt species at the cationic exchange sites of the sup-
port zeolites and isolated Pt species within the pores of SBA-15 can
play a vital role in the catalysis as concluded in [13,1921]. This
scenario, indeed, provides a perfect basis to investigate the influ-
ence of pore geometry of support on the DHP performance as dis-
cussed below.
3.2. Dehydrogenation of propane
The catalytic performance of Pt-ZSM-5, Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15
in dehydrogenation of propane was studied to assess exclusively
the influence of pore geometry of the supports (by keeping Pt con-
tent identical and the size of Pt particles essentially the same in the
catalysts as evidenced by the XRD and H2-chemisorption tech-
niques and there by largely eliminating the effect of Pt particle
size) on catalytic activity, selectivity and the degree of coke forma-
tion. Fig. 3 shows C3H8 conversion and coke formation over these
catalysts at 793 K. Initial C3H8 conversion values correspond to
the analysis of reaction products after 5 min on-stream. It can be
readily seen from Fig. 3 that the propane conversion is decreasing
with increasing pore size of the supports during the whole time
on-stream studied here. Pt-ZSM-5 containing the smallest pores
among the catalysts studied in this work shows considerably high-
er C3H8 conversion during the reaction followed by Pt-Beta and
Pt-SBA-15 (Tables 13). It is also evidenced by the specific activity
with respect to the surface Pt sites (turnover frequencies, TOFs) as
shown in Table 2. It is noteworthy that over Pt-ZSM-5 and
Pt-Beta, propane conversion slightly increased initially with time
on-stream and reached a maximum at around 35 min and thereaf-
ter decreased gradually. Such behaviour was not observed on Pt-
SBA-15 rather the propane conversion gradually decreased with
time. The corresponding TOFs at 5 (initial), 35 (at a maximum pro-
pane conversion over Pt-zeolites) and 170 (almost at the end of the
reaction) min on-stream also support the same (Table 2). The
behaviour of the catalysts is also reflected in the products selectiv-
ity (Table 3). In addition to propylene being the main product,
methane, ethane and ethylene are also formed as by-products over
the catalysts. Among these by-products, methane is the most dom-
inating followed by ethane and ethylene. For the sake of clarity,
only selectivity to methane, besides to propylene, is shown for
the catalysts in Fig. 4. Over Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta, selectivity to
propylene is higher (and selectivity to methane is lower) in the ini-
tial period and it decreased with increasing propane conversion
with time on-stream. After 35 min on-stream (i.e., after a maxi-
mum propane conversion followed by its steady decrease), selec-
tivity to propylene steadily increased and that to methane
decreased. Such a decrease in selectivity to propylene was previ-
ously observed over Pt/Sn/Na/ZSM-5 catalysts and was attributed
to the changes in catalyst acidity and/or active sites [32]. Differ-
ently, as expected, over Pt-SBA-15 initial selectivity to propylene
is lower (and methane is higher) and it increased with time on-
stream that was accompanied by decreased propane conversion
(Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 3). The above observations may indicate
that additional Pt sites present in Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta which
may be largely missing in Pt-SBA-15 are involved, besides Pt nano-
particles, in the DHP reaction. The additional sites could be Pt at
the cationic exchange positions and/or acidic sites. Moreover, a
small fraction of coke on the catalysts (i.e., in the initial period)

could favour the adsorption of propane at the vicinity of active
sites that may lead to higher propane conversion. However, a high-
er amount of coke deposits leads to the deactivation of the cata-
lysts as evidenced by the decreased propane conversion in Fig. 3.
It is noteworthy that Pt-SBA-15 (in the present study) with an
average particle size of around 16 nm shows higher propane con-
version and coke formation as compared to Pt-SBA-15-IMP with
a particle size of around 21 nm [6]. The results again confirm our
previous conclusions on the effect of Pt particle size on the cata-
lytic performance during the DHP reaction. Accordingly, smaller
Pt particles are more active but less selective and less stable than
the larger particles [6].
The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports is
significant on the formation of coke during the DHP reaction
(Fig. 3 and Table 3). Despite high conversion of propane over both
Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta, the selectivity to coke is markedly different
on both the catalysts. The initial selectivity to coke on the former is
much higher (0.032%) than that on the latter (0.01%), while it is
0.017% on Pt-SBA-15. After 35 min on-stream, selectivity to prod-
ucts is more or less stabilized (Table 3). The amount of coke con-
tent after 170 min on-stream was measured to be the highest on
Pt-ZSM-5, as expected, followed by, though surprising, on Pt-
SBA-15 and Pt-Beta (Fig. 3 and Table 3). These results indicate that
pore geometry of the supports (together with Pt species within the
pores) determines the products selectivity, especially to coke. Thus
the observed product selectivity could also be attributed to the
shape-selectivity effects of micro and mesoporous materials,
which is a well known phenomenon of such materials in hydrocar-
bon conversions [1921].
Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the
undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc.,
which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydro-
genation reaction. Whilst, these side reactions may not be signifi-
cant under these experimental conditions on support Beta. This
could explain the higher amount of coke content on catalysts Pt-
ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15 as compared on Pt-Beta. Therefore, the latter
exhibits better stability than the former two catalysts as evidenced
by TOFs in Table 2 and conversion profiles in Fig. 3. Significantly,
Pt-ZSM-5 is more stable than Pt-SBA-15 despite containing almost
double the amount of coke content (Fig. 3 and Tables 2 and 3). This
is further supported by deactivation functions (r/r0), derived from
the catalytic data in Fig. 3. The resulting deactivation functions
are plotted against the amount of coke formation during the reac-
tion (Fig. 5) to determine the catalyst stability. It can be readily
seen that despite high amount of coke formation on Pt-ZSM-5,
the relative loss in reaction rate is much lower while it is more sig-
nificant on Pt-SBA-15 even though the amount of coke deposition
is lower. The relative loss in reaction rate is 15% for Pt-ZSM-5
whereas it is almost 25% for Pt-SBA-15. As expected, Pt-Beta con-
taining the lowest amount of coke among these catalysts exhibits
better stability with a loss of 8% in the relative reaction rate. Inter-
estingly, despite four times higher coke content on Pt-ZSM-5 than
that on Pt-Beta, it shows only twice the loss in the relative reaction
rate suggesting that a large amount of active sites are still accessi-
ble by propane molecules in the former.
The above results evidence that despite identical Pt content and
virtually the same particle size in the catalysts, Pt supported on the
zeolites are more active, selective and stable than that on the meso-
porous SBA-15. Among the zeolites, though Pt-Beta shows better
selectivity and stability than Pt-ZSM-5, the latter is still attractive.
The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could
originate from the active sites that are associated with cation ex-
changesites and might be complemented by theirthree dimensional
pore geometry. On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may
not provide the required contact between the reactant and active
sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane
adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may
haveleadtoits lowercatalyticperformance.Previouslyoneofusalso
reached a similar conclusion on the vital role of pore network on
various catalytic conversions of N2O (including oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane with N2O) over Fesilicalite and Fe-SBA-15 with
thesame ironconstitution[26]. This suggests thatthepore geometry
of the support materials plays an important role in deriving the
optimum catalytic properties of a supported active metal.

An attempt to correlate our results with the literature data re-
ported on DHP over a variety of catalysts would be a difficult task
due to different catalyst compositions with respect to the active
metals and promoters, ratios between Si and Al, reaction mixtures
and space velocities. Nonetheless, the most related (to the present
study) literature data on DHP over Pt catalysts with different pore
geometries are considered in Table 4 to derive correlations be-
tween pore geometry of the supports and catalytic performance.
It can be noticed that the compared studies on zeolite based cata-
lysts differ strongly in the metal compositions and Si/Al of zeolites
but are similar in Pt content (wt.%), temperature used for DHP
reaction (823  40 K) and space velocity (2 h1). The marked
differences between the present study and the previous reports
lie in the ratio of Si/Al of the zeolites, Pt content and space velocity
(Tables 1 and 4). Therefore, it should be noted that the correlations
must be treated with caution. Despite differences mentioned
above, Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta used in this study show better activ-
ity (with respect to the conversion and selectivity) than some of
the catalysts, including the promoted ones for example zeolites-Y
and MOR [18,21]. Furthermore, they present better selectivity to
propylene than previously reported on ZSM-5 and Beta (Table 4),
except on Pt/NaFe-ZSM-5 in [19,20]. Interestingly, Pt-SBA-15 that
showed poor catalytic performance than Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta
studied in this work is better than the un-promoted PtH-MOR
and PtH-Y [18]. The mesoporous Pt-SBA-15 exhibits comparable
catalytic activity with the promoted large pore zeolites Zn,Na-
MOR and Zn,Na-Y (except Zn,KL). When Pt containing micropo-
rous zeolites is promoted with an electropositive element, they
emerge as the most active and stable catalysts than the large pore
zeolites (MOR, Y and L), for example Pt/NaFe-ZSM-5 (Table 4) and
as discussed in [1921,23]. The present study is in good agreement
with the previous observations and it provides direct evidence on
the influence of pore geometry of the support on the catalytic per-
formance by TEOM. Accordingly, it can be concluded that zeolites
ZSM-5 and Beta can be attractive support materials than the mes-
oporous SBA-15 to stabilize Pt and to derive its optimum catalytic
activity for DHP.
4. Conclusion
The influence of pore geometry of microporous (ZSM-5 and
Beta) and mesoporous (SBA-15) materials was studied on dehydro-
genation of propane by TEOM. The catalysts were obtained by
incipient wetness impregnation with identical Pt content and with
similar Pt dispersion as evidenced by the characterization results.
This largely, though not completely, eliminates the effect of Pt par-
ticle size on DHP [6]. It allowed us to investigate exclusively the
influence of pore geometry of these three different framework
structures on the catalytic performance. Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta ex-
hibit superior DHP activity, selectivity to propylene and stability
than Pt-SBA-15 as evidenced by TEOM results indicating that three
dimensional microporous geometries are essential to obtain opti-
mum catalytic properties of Pt sites located within the pores. The
superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their
intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange
sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores
which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant
molecules. These properties are largely missing in mesoporous
SBA-15, which could attribute to its lower catalytic performance
in DHP.
