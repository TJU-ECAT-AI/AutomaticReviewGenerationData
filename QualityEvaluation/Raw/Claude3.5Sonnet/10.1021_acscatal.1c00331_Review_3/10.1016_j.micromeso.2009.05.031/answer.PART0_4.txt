[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials"

[2] "The amount of coke content after 170 min on-stream was measured to be the highest on Pt-ZSM-5, as expected, followed by, though surprising, on Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Beta"

[3] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc., which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Whilst, these side reactions may not be significant under these experimental conditions on support Beta."

[4] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation exchange sites and might be complemented by their three dimensional pore geometry."

[5] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may have lead to its lower catalytic performance."

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores in microporous materials like ZSM-5 and Beta tend to promote higher catalytic activity and selectivity compared to larger pores in mesoporous materials like SBA-15. However, smaller pores may also lead to higher coke formation.

2. Connectivity: Three-dimensional pore networks in zeolites (ZSM-5 and Beta) provide better connectivity and accessibility to active sites, enhancing catalytic performance compared to the one-dimensional cylindrical pores of SBA-15.

3. Uniformity: Uniform pore structures in zeolites contribute to shape selectivity effects, which can influence product distribution and coke formation.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: The presence of both micropores and mesopores can potentially balance activity, selectivity, and coke formation. While not explicitly studied in this work, hierarchical structures could combine the benefits of different pore sizes.

5. Cation exchange capacity: Zeolites with cation exchange sites show superior performance, suggesting that the combination of pore structure and active site distribution is crucial for optimal catalysis.

These relationships imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus on:
- Balancing pore size to maximize activity and selectivity while minimizing coke formation
- Utilizing three-dimensional pore networks for improved accessibility to active sites
- Incorporating shape selectivity effects through uniform pore structures
- Exploring hierarchical pore arrangements to combine the advantages of different pore sizes
- Considering the synergy between pore structure and active site distribution, particularly in materials with cation exchange capacity

催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：

1. 孔径：ZSM-5和Beta等微孔材料中的较小孔径往往促进更高的催化活性和选择性，相比于SBA-15等介孔材料中的较大孔径。然而，较小的孔径也可能导致更高的积碳形成。

2. 连通性：沸石（ZSM-5和Beta）中的三维孔网络提供了更好的连通性和活性位点的可及性，与SBA-15的一维圆柱形孔相比，增强了催化性能。

3. 均匀性：沸石中均匀的孔结构有助于形状选择性效应，这可能影响产品分布和积碳形成。

4. 层次结构：微孔和介孔的共存可能平衡活性、选择性和积碳形成。虽然本研究没有明确研究这一点，但分级结构可能结合不同孔径的优点。

5. 阳离子交换能力：具有阳离子交换位点的沸石表现出优越的性能，表明孔结构和活性位点分布的组合对于最佳催化至关重要。

这些关系意味着设计最佳PDH催化剂应关注：
- 平衡孔径以最大化活性和选择性，同时最小化积碳形成
- 利用三维孔网络提高活性位点的可及性
- 通过均匀的孔结构引入形状选择性效应
- 探索分级孔排列，以结合不同孔径的优势
- 考虑孔结构和活性位点分布之间的协同作用，特别是在具有阳离子交换能力的材料中
