[1] "Pt-ZSM-5 containing the smallest pores among the catalysts studied in this work shows considerably higher C3H8 conversion during the reaction followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15"

[2] "The amount of coke content after 170 min on-stream was measured to be the highest on Pt-ZSM-5, as expected, followed by, though surprising, on Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Beta"

[3] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc., which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Whilst, these side reactions may not be significant under these experimental conditions on support Beta."

[4] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation exchange sites and might be complemented by their three dimensional pore geometry."

[5] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may have lead to its lower catalytic performance."

The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores (as in ZSM-5) lead to higher propane conversion but also more coke formation. Larger pores (as in SBA-15) result in lower conversion and intermediate coke formation.

2. Connectivity: Three-dimensional pore networks (as in zeolites) provide better catalytic performance compared to one-dimensional cylindrical pores (as in SBA-15).

3. Uniformity: Uniform microporous structures (zeolites) show superior performance compared to mesoporous materials (SBA-15).

4. Hierarchical arrangements: The presence of cation exchange sites in zeolites, combined with their three-dimensional pore geometry, contributes to better catalytic performance.

These relationships imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus on:

1. Balancing pore size to maximize conversion while minimizing coke formation.
2. Utilizing three-dimensional pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact.
3. Incorporating uniform microporous structures with cation exchange sites.
4. Developing hierarchical pore arrangements that combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities.

催化剂载体的孔结构特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：

1. 孔径：较小的孔（如ZSM-5中）导致更高的丙烷转化率，但也形成更多积炭。较大的孔（如SBA-15中）导致较低的转化率和中等程度的积炭形成。

2. 连通性：三维孔网络（如沸石中）比一维圆柱形孔（如SBA-15中）提供更好的催化性能。

3. 均匀性：均匀的微孔结构（沸石）比介孔材料（SBA-15）表现出更优越的性能。

4. 层级排列：沸石中阳离子交换位点的存在，结合其三维孔几何结构，有助于获得更好的催化性能。

这些关系意味着设计最佳PDH催化剂应该关注：

1. 平衡孔径大小，以最大化转化率同时最小化积炭形成。
2. 利用三维孔网络来增强反应物与催化剂的接触。
3. 结合具有阳离子交换位点的均匀微孔结构。
4. 开发结合不同孔径和连通性优势的层级孔排列。
