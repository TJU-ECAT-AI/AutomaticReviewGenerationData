[1] "The influence of the pore geometry (pore structure and size) of micro and mesoporous materials that contain Pt particles, essentially of the same size, besides isolated species on the catalytic performance."

[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta exhibit superior DHP activity, selectivity to propylene and stability than Pt-SBA-15 as evidenced by TEOM results indicating that three dimensional microporous geometries are essential to obtain optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites located within the pores."

[3] "The amount of coke content after 170 min on-stream was measured to be the highest on Pt-ZSM-5, as expected, followed by, though surprising, on Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Beta"

[4] "Significantly, Pt-ZSM-5 is more stable than Pt-SBA-15 despite containing almost double the amount of coke content"

[5] "The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules."

The pore structures of catalyst supports significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size: Smaller pores in microporous materials like ZSM-5 and Beta lead to higher catalytic activity and selectivity compared to larger pores in mesoporous materials like SBA-15.

2. Connectivity: Three-dimensional pore networks in microporous materials provide better connectivity, facilitating reactions between active sites and reactant molecules.

3. Uniformity: Uniform pore structures in zeolites contribute to shape-selectivity effects, enhancing catalytic performance.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: The combination of micropores and mesopores can influence coke formation and accommodation. For example, Pt-ZSM-5 showed higher coke content but better stability compared to Pt-SBA-15.

These relationships imply that optimal catalysts for PDH reactions should have:

1. Smaller pore sizes to enhance activity and selectivity
2. Three-dimensional pore networks for better connectivity
3. Uniform pore structures to promote shape-selectivity
4. A balance between micropores and mesopores to manage coke formation and accommodation

Designers should focus on developing catalysts with these characteristics to improve overall performance in PDH reactions.

催化剂载体的孔结构特性对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：

1. 孔径：ZSM-5和Beta等微孔材料的小孔径与SBA-15等介孔材料的大孔径相比，能够带来更高的催化活性和选择性。

2. 连通性：微孔材料中的三维孔网络提供了更好的连通性，有利于活性位点和反应物分子之间的反应。

3. 均一性：沸石中均一的孔结构有助于形状选择性效应，提高催化性能。

4. 层次结构：微孔和介孔的组合可以影响积碳形成和容纳。例如，Pt-ZSM-5虽然积碳含量较高，但比Pt-SBA-15表现出更好的稳定性。

这些关系意味着PDH反应的最佳催化剂应具有：

1. 较小的孔径，以提高活性和选择性
2. 三维孔网络，以获得更好的连通性
3. 均一的孔结构，以促进形状选择性
4. 微孔和介孔之间的平衡，以管理积碳形成和容纳

设计者应该专注于开发具有这些特性的催化剂，以提高PDH反应的整体性能。
