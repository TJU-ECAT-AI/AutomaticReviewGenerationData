The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. This comprehensive review analyzes the impact of various pore structure characteristics on PDH catalyst performance and provides insights for optimal catalyst design.

1. Pore Size:
Pore size plays a crucial role in determining catalyst activity, selectivity, and coke formation. Generally, smaller pores lead to higher propane conversion and catalytic activity [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. However, the relationship between pore size and coke formation is complex. While smaller pores tend to limit coke yield [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4], they may also promote more coke formation in some cases [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. Larger pores can accommodate more coke before becoming completely blocked [10.1002/aic.16410], potentially extending catalyst lifetime.

2. Pore Connectivity:
Three-dimensional, interconnected pore networks generally outperform one-dimensional pore structures in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. Higher pore connectivity can maintain catalyst activity for longer periods by providing alternative pathways for reactants and products when some pores become blocked [10.1002/aic.16410].

3. Uniformity:
Uniform pore structures, such as those found in zeolites, contribute to superior catalyst performance compared to less uniform structures [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. Uniformity can lead to shape-selectivity effects, influencing product distribution and coke formation. However, supports with wide pore size distributions may allow coke to cover the external surface rather than the metallic surface, potentially helping maintain catalyst activity [10.1002/jctb.4686].

4. Hierarchical Arrangements:
Hierarchical pore structures, combining different pore sizes and connectivities, have shown promising results in PDH catalysts. These structures can balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion [10.1002/aic.16410], enhance mass transfer, and improve catalyst stability [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286]. For example, the introduction of hierarchical pores in ZSM-5 zeolite improved the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke and enhanced propane conversion and stability [10.1002/jctb.4686].

5. Coke Formation and Accommodation:
The pore structure significantly affects coke formation and accommodation. Zeolite supports with ordered microporous structures have shown lower coke formation compared to traditional alumina supports [10.1002/anie.202003349]. Hierarchical pore structures can enhance the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke while maintaining activity [10.1002/jctb.4686]. The location of coke deposition (e.g., on the external surface vs. within pores) also impacts catalyst performance [10.1002/anie.202003349].

6. Support Composition and Acidity:
While not directly related to pore structure, the chemical composition and acidity of the support interact with pore characteristics to influence catalyst performance. For instance, the acidity of the support can be modified by introducing hierarchical pores, which can inhibit coke formation on the metal and improve the support's capacity for coke accommodation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3].

Implications for Optimal Catalyst Design:
1. Develop supports with carefully tailored hierarchical pore structures that balance coke accommodation capacity with catalytic performance.
2. Optimize pore size distribution to achieve an ideal balance between metal dispersion, reactant/product diffusion, and coke resistance.
3. Utilize three-dimensional, interconnected pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact and accessibility to active sites.
4. Consider the interplay between pore structure and surface acidity to achieve desired catalytic performance and coke resistance.
5. Design pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions while facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites.
6. Focus on creating a balance between micropores, mesopores, and macropores to maximize catalytic performance and longevity.

By carefully engineering catalyst support pore structures with these factors in mind, it is possible to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions with improved resistance to coking and enhanced overall performance.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structures in PDH reactions reveals the complex interplay between various structural characteristics and their impact on catalyst performance. This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization.

Looking forward, several key areas of research and development emerge:

1. Advanced pore engineering: Future studies could focus on developing precise methods to create tailored pore structures with optimal combinations of pore sizes, connectivity, and hierarchical arrangements. This may involve novel synthesis techniques or the use of advanced templating agents.

2. In-situ characterization: Developing methods for real-time observation of coke formation and its interaction with pore structures during PDH reactions could provide invaluable insights for catalyst design.

3. Multiscale modeling: Integrating molecular-level simulations with macroscale reactor models could help predict the long-term performance of catalysts with different pore structures, guiding experimental efforts.

4. Smart materials: Exploring the potential of responsive or adaptable pore structures that can dynamically change during reaction conditions to optimize performance and minimize coking.

5. Synergistic effects: Investigating how pore structure characteristics can be combined with other catalyst design strategies, such as bimetallic active sites or promoters, to achieve superior performance.

6. Sustainable catalyst design: Focusing on developing catalysts with optimized pore structures that not only enhance performance but also improve catalyst longevity and ease of regeneration, contributing to more sustainable industrial processes.

These research directions could lead to the next generation of highly efficient, stable, and coke-resistant PDH catalysts, potentially revolutionizing the production of propylene and other valuable chemicals.

The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. This comprehensive review analyzes the impact of various pore structure characteristics on PDH catalyst performance and provides insights for optimal catalyst design.

1. Pore Size:
Pore size plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance and coke formation. Smaller pores generally lead to higher propane conversion and catalytic activity, with the order of activity decreasing with increasing pore size: ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15 [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. However, the relationship between pore size and coke formation is complex. While smaller pores can limit coke formation, they are also more susceptible to blockage [10.1002/aic.16410]. Studies have shown that coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size, as demonstrated by varying coke amounts observed on different catalysts [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

2. Pore Connectivity and Uniformity:
Three-dimensional microporous materials (e.g., ZSM-5 and Beta) generally outperform one-dimensional mesoporous materials (e.g., SBA-15) in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. This suggests that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions and provide improved accessibility to active sites. Uniformity in pore structure contributes to shape-selectivity effects, which can influence product distribution and coke formation [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

3. Hierarchical Arrangements:
Hierarchical pore structures, combining micropores and mesopores, have shown great promise in enhancing catalyst performance. For example, the introduction of hierarchical pores in ZSM-5 zeolite (ZQ) significantly improved the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke while maintaining high activity [10.1002/jctb.4686]. These structures typically include smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface, which enhance mass transfer and diffusion kinetics [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286].

4. Surface Area and Pore Volume:
High surface area and pore volume generally contribute to better catalyst performance. Catalysts with higher surface areas (e.g., Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion rates compared to those with lower surface areas [10.1007/s10562-010-0527-5]. However, this must be balanced with other factors, as high surface area catalysts may also be more susceptible to coke formation and subsequent deactivation.

5. Support Composition and Acidity:
The chemical nature of the support material significantly influences catalyst performance and coke formation. For instance, SiO2 supports allowed for better metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn compared to Al2O3, leading to improved propane conversion and propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. The acidity of the support also plays a crucial role, with stronger acidity generally leading to increased coke formation [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

6. Coke Formation and Accommodation:
The pore structure significantly affects the catalyst's ability to form, accommodate, and resist coke. Supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, potentially extending catalyst lifetime [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3]. However, the relationship is complex, as demonstrated by the observation that Pt-ZSM-5 (smallest pores) showed the highest coke formation, while Pt-Beta had the lowest [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

7. Metal Dispersion and Stability:
The pore structure influences metal dispersion and stability, which in turn affect catalyst performance and coke formation. Hierarchical pore structures can inhibit the agglomeration of metal particles during reactions, contributing to improved catalyst stability [10.1002/jctb.4686]. Additionally, the confinement effect of zeolite structures allows for the generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species, which can enhance catalytic performance [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7].

Implications for Optimal Catalyst Design:
Based on these findings, several strategies can be employed to design optimal PDH catalysts:

1. Develop supports with hierarchical pore structures that combine the benefits of micropores (high surface area, shape selectivity) and mesopores (improved mass transfer, coke accommodation).
2. Optimize pore size distribution to balance metal dispersion, reactant/product diffusion, and coke resistance.
3. Utilize three-dimensional pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact and accessibility to active sites.
4. Consider the interplay between pore structure and surface acidity to achieve desired catalytic performance and coke resistance.
5. Design pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions while facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites.
6. Explore novel support materials and compositions that can further enhance metal-support interactions and coke resistance.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structures in PDH reactions reveals the intricate interplay between various structural characteristics and their impact on catalyst performance. Moving forward, research efforts should focus on developing advanced hierarchical pore structures that can synergistically combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities. This may involve exploring novel synthesis methods, such as templating techniques or post-synthetic modifications, to create tailored pore architectures.

Future research directions could include:

1. Investigation of multi-scale hierarchical structures that incorporate micro-, meso-, and macropores in a controlled manner to optimize mass transfer, active site accessibility, and coke resistance.
2. Development of dynamic pore structures that can adapt to reaction conditions, potentially through the use of responsive materials or in-situ pore modification techniques.
3. Exploration of advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy and tomography, to gain deeper insights into the evolution of pore structures during PDH reactions and coke formation processes.
4. Integration of computational modeling and machine learning approaches to predict optimal pore structures for specific reaction conditions and desired performance characteristics.
5. Investigation of the potential of novel support materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which offer highly tunable pore structures and chemical functionalities.

By addressing these research avenues, the field can move towards the development of next-generation PDH catalysts with enhanced performance, longer lifetimes, and improved sustainability.
