The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. This comprehensive review analyzes the impact of various pore structure characteristics on PDH catalyst performance and provides insights for optimal catalyst design.

1. Pore Size:
Pore size plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance and coke formation. Smaller pores generally lead to higher propane conversion and catalytic activity, with the order of activity decreasing with increasing pore size: ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15 [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. However, the relationship between pore size and coke formation is complex. While smaller pores can limit coke formation, they are also more susceptible to blockage [10.1002/aic.16410]. Studies have shown that coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size, as demonstrated by varying coke amounts observed on different catalysts [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

2. Pore Connectivity and Uniformity:
Three-dimensional microporous materials (e.g., ZSM-5 and Beta) generally outperform one-dimensional mesoporous materials (e.g., SBA-15) in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. This suggests that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions and provide improved accessibility to active sites. Uniformity in pore structure contributes to shape-selectivity effects, which can influence product distribution and coke formation [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

3. Hierarchical Arrangements:
Hierarchical pore structures, combining micropores and mesopores, have shown great promise in enhancing catalyst performance. For example, the introduction of hierarchical pores in ZSM-5 zeolite (ZQ) significantly improved the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke while maintaining high activity [10.1002/jctb.4686]. These structures typically include smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface, which enhance mass transfer and diffusion kinetics [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286].

4. Surface Area and Pore Volume:
High surface area and pore volume generally contribute to better catalyst performance. Catalysts with higher surface areas (e.g., Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion rates compared to those with lower surface areas [10.1007/s10562-010-0527-5]. However, this must be balanced with other factors, as high surface area catalysts may also be more susceptible to coke formation and subsequent deactivation.

5. Support Composition and Acidity:
The chemical nature of the support material significantly influences catalyst performance and coke formation. For instance, SiO2 supports allowed for better metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn compared to Al2O3, leading to improved propane conversion and propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008]. The acidity of the support also plays a crucial role, with stronger acidity generally leading to increased coke formation [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

6. Coke Formation and Accommodation:
The pore structure significantly affects the catalyst's ability to form, accommodate, and resist coke. Supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, potentially extending catalyst lifetime [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3]. However, the relationship is complex, as demonstrated by the observation that Pt-ZSM-5 (smallest pores) showed the highest coke formation, while Pt-Beta had the lowest [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

7. Metal Dispersion and Stability:
The pore structure influences metal dispersion and stability, which in turn affect catalyst performance and coke formation. Hierarchical pore structures can inhibit the agglomeration of metal particles during reactions, contributing to improved catalyst stability [10.1002/jctb.4686]. Additionally, the confinement effect of zeolite structures allows for the generation and stabilization of subnanometric metal species, which can enhance catalytic performance [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7].

Implications for Optimal Catalyst Design:
Based on these findings, several strategies can be employed to design optimal PDH catalysts:

1. Develop supports with hierarchical pore structures that combine the benefits of micropores (high surface area, shape selectivity) and mesopores (improved mass transfer, coke accommodation).
2. Optimize pore size distribution to balance metal dispersion, reactant/product diffusion, and coke resistance.
3. Utilize three-dimensional pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact and accessibility to active sites.
4. Consider the interplay between pore structure and surface acidity to achieve desired catalytic performance and coke resistance.
5. Design pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions while facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites.
6. Explore novel support materials and compositions that can further enhance metal-support interactions and coke resistance.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structures in PDH reactions reveals the intricate interplay between various structural characteristics and their impact on catalyst performance. Moving forward, research efforts should focus on developing advanced hierarchical pore structures that can synergistically combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities. This may involve exploring novel synthesis methods, such as templating techniques or post-synthetic modifications, to create tailored pore architectures.

Future research directions could include:

1. Investigation of multi-scale hierarchical structures that incorporate micro-, meso-, and macropores in a controlled manner to optimize mass transfer, active site accessibility, and coke resistance.
2. Development of dynamic pore structures that can adapt to reaction conditions, potentially through the use of responsive materials or in-situ pore modification techniques.
3. Exploration of advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy and tomography, to gain deeper insights into the evolution of pore structures during PDH reactions and coke formation processes.
4. Integration of computational modeling and machine learning approaches to predict optimal pore structures for specific reaction conditions and desired performance characteristics.
5. Investigation of the potential of novel support materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which offer highly tunable pore structures and chemical functionalities.

By addressing these research avenues, the field can move towards the development of next-generation PDH catalysts with enhanced performance, longer lifetimes, and improved sustainability.

The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is complex and multifaceted. Various studies have provided insights into how different aspects of pore structure affect catalyst behavior and longevity.

Pore size plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance and coke formation. Smaller pore sizes generally result in higher propane conversion and catalytic activity, with the order of activity decreasing as pore size increases: ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15 [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. However, the relationship between pore size and coke formation is not straightforward. While smaller pores can limit coke formation, they are also more susceptible to blockage [10.1002/aic.16410]. Studies have shown that coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size, with catalysts having larger pore sizes correlating to higher coke yields [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

Pore connectivity and uniformity significantly influence catalyst performance and coke formation. Three-dimensional microporous materials (e.g., ZSM-5 and Beta zeolites) outperform one-dimensional mesoporous materials (e.g., SBA-15) in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. This suggests that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions and provide improved accessibility to active sites. Uniformity in pore structure contributes to shape-selectivity effects, which can influence product distribution and coke formation [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

Hierarchical pore arrangements have shown promise in optimizing catalyst performance. The introduction of hierarchical pores in zeolite supports, such as ZSM-5, greatly improves the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke while maintaining catalytic activity [10.1002/jctb.4686]. These structures typically combine smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) with larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface, enhancing mass transfer and diffusion kinetics [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286].

The interplay between pore structure and surface chemistry is also crucial. Modifying the pore structure of zeolites by introducing hierarchical pores can decrease support acidity, which inhibits coke formation on the metal and improves the support's capacity for coke accommodation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3]. This highlights the importance of considering both physical structure and chemical properties when designing catalysts.

Coke formation and accommodation are significantly influenced by pore structure. While coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species do not necessarily directly block the active sites in well-designed catalyst systems [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7]. Supports with more uniform, highly connected, and larger-sized pores can accommodate more coke, potentially extending catalyst lifetime [10.1002/jctb.4686].

The impact of pore structure on metal particle stabilization is another important consideration. Hierarchical pore structures can inhibit the agglomeration of metal particles during reactions, contributing to improved catalyst stability [10.1002/jctb.4686]. This is particularly important for maintaining the activity of subnanometric metal species, which are crucial for optimal catalytic performance in PDH reactions [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7].

These findings have significant implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Balancing pore size to maximize conversion while minimizing coke formation and maintaining accessibility to active sites.
2. Utilizing three-dimensional, interconnected pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact and improve mass transfer.
3. Incorporating hierarchical pore structures that combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities to optimize both reaction kinetics and coke accommodation.
4. Considering the synergy between pore structure and surface chemistry, particularly in tailoring support acidity and metal-support interactions.
5. Designing pore structures that promote uniform coke deposition and facilitate the migration of coke precursors away from active sites.
6. Optimizing pore connectivity to maintain catalyst activity even as some pores become blocked by coke.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structures in PDH reactions reveals the intricate balance required for optimal performance. Future research directions should focus on developing advanced hierarchical pore structures that can dynamically adapt to changing reaction conditions. This could involve the use of stimuli-responsive materials or self-healing supports that can maintain optimal pore characteristics throughout the catalyst lifecycle.

Additionally, the integration of in-situ characterization techniques with machine learning algorithms could provide real-time insights into coke formation and distribution within the pore network. This would enable the development of predictive models for catalyst deactivation and guide the design of next-generation PDH catalysts with enhanced longevity and performance.

Furthermore, exploring the potential of novel materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as catalyst supports could open up new possibilities for precise control over pore structure and metal-support interactions. These materials offer unprecedented tunability in terms of pore size, connectivity, and chemical functionality, which could lead to breakthroughs in catalyst design for PDH reactions and beyond.
