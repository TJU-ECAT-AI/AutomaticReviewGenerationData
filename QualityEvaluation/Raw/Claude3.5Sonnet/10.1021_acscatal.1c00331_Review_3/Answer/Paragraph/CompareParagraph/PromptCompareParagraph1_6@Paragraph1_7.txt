The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. This comprehensive review analyzes the impact of various pore structure characteristics on PDH catalyst performance and provides insights for optimal catalyst design.

1. Pore Size:
Pore size plays a crucial role in determining catalyst activity, selectivity, and coke formation. Generally, smaller pores lead to higher propane conversion and catalytic activity [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. However, the relationship between pore size and coke formation is complex. While smaller pores tend to limit coke yield [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4], they may also promote more coke formation in some cases [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. Larger pores can accommodate more coke before becoming completely blocked [10.1002/aic.16410], potentially extending catalyst lifetime.

2. Pore Connectivity:
Three-dimensional, interconnected pore networks generally outperform one-dimensional pore structures in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. Higher pore connectivity can maintain catalyst activity for longer periods by providing alternative pathways for reactants and products when some pores become blocked [10.1002/aic.16410].

3. Uniformity:
Uniform pore structures, such as those found in zeolites, contribute to superior catalyst performance compared to less uniform structures [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. Uniformity can lead to shape-selectivity effects, influencing product distribution and coke formation. However, supports with wide pore size distributions may allow coke to cover the external surface rather than the metallic surface, potentially helping maintain catalyst activity [10.1002/jctb.4686].

4. Hierarchical Arrangements:
Hierarchical pore structures, combining different pore sizes and connectivities, have shown promising results in PDH catalysts. These structures can balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion [10.1002/aic.16410], enhance mass transfer, and improve catalyst stability [10.1021/acscatal.0c03286]. For example, the introduction of hierarchical pores in ZSM-5 zeolite improved the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke and enhanced propane conversion and stability [10.1002/jctb.4686].

5. Coke Formation and Accommodation:
The pore structure significantly affects coke formation and accommodation. Zeolite supports with ordered microporous structures have shown lower coke formation compared to traditional alumina supports [10.1002/anie.202003349]. Hierarchical pore structures can enhance the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke while maintaining activity [10.1002/jctb.4686]. The location of coke deposition (e.g., on the external surface vs. within pores) also impacts catalyst performance [10.1002/anie.202003349].

6. Support Composition and Acidity:
While not directly related to pore structure, the chemical composition and acidity of the support interact with pore characteristics to influence catalyst performance. For instance, the acidity of the support can be modified by introducing hierarchical pores, which can inhibit coke formation on the metal and improve the support's capacity for coke accommodation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3].

Implications for Optimal Catalyst Design:
1. Develop supports with carefully tailored hierarchical pore structures that balance coke accommodation capacity with catalytic performance.
2. Optimize pore size distribution to achieve an ideal balance between metal dispersion, reactant/product diffusion, and coke resistance.
3. Utilize three-dimensional, interconnected pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact and accessibility to active sites.
4. Consider the interplay between pore structure and surface acidity to achieve desired catalytic performance and coke resistance.
5. Design pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions while facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites.
6. Focus on creating a balance between micropores, mesopores, and macropores to maximize catalytic performance and longevity.

By carefully engineering catalyst support pore structures with these factors in mind, it is possible to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions with improved resistance to coking and enhanced overall performance.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structures in PDH reactions reveals the complex interplay between various structural characteristics and their impact on catalyst performance. This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization.

Looking forward, several key areas of research and development emerge:

1. Advanced pore engineering: Future studies could focus on developing precise methods to create tailored pore structures with optimal combinations of pore sizes, connectivity, and hierarchical arrangements. This may involve novel synthesis techniques or the use of advanced templating agents.

2. In-situ characterization: Developing methods for real-time observation of coke formation and its interaction with pore structures during PDH reactions could provide invaluable insights for catalyst design.

3. Multiscale modeling: Integrating molecular-level simulations with macroscale reactor models could help predict the long-term performance of catalysts with different pore structures, guiding experimental efforts.

4. Smart materials: Exploring the potential of responsive or adaptable pore structures that can dynamically change during reaction conditions to optimize performance and minimize coking.

5. Synergistic effects: Investigating how pore structure characteristics can be combined with other catalyst design strategies, such as bimetallic active sites or promoters, to achieve superior performance.

6. Sustainable catalyst design: Focusing on developing catalysts with optimized pore structures that not only enhance performance but also improve catalyst longevity and ease of regeneration, contributing to more sustainable industrial processes.

These research directions could lead to the next generation of highly efficient, stable, and coke-resistant PDH catalysts, potentially revolutionizing the production of propylene and other valuable chemicals.

The comprehensive influence of catalyst support pore structure characteristics on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is a complex and multifaceted topic. Based on the literature, several key aspects can be identified:

1. Pore Size: Pore size significantly impacts coke formation and catalyst performance. Smaller pores generally lead to higher propane conversion and catalytic activity, with the order of activity decreasing as pore size increases: ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15 [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. However, the relationship between pore size and coke formation is not straightforward. While smaller pores can limit coke formation, they are also more susceptible to blockage [10.1002/aic.16410]. Studies have shown that coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size, with catalysts like 3% Pt-SiO2 (1.0 nm pores) showing significantly less coke formation compared to 3% Pt-Al2O3 (7.53 nm pores) [10.1007/s10562-009-0196-4].

2. Connectivity and Accessibility: Three-dimensional microporous materials (e.g., ZSM-5 and Beta zeolites) generally outperform one-dimensional mesoporous materials (e.g., SBA-15) in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031]. This suggests that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions and provide improved accessibility to active sites. Hierarchical pore structures, combining micropores and mesopores, have shown enhanced mass transfer properties and improved catalyst stability [10.1002/jctb.4686].

3. Uniformity: Uniform pore size distribution, coupled with a large surface area, favors the dispersion of metallic particles, enhancing catalyst performance [10.1002/jctb.4686]. The uniform microporous structure of zeolites contributes to their superior performance compared to materials with larger, less uniform pores [10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031].

4. Hierarchical Arrangements: The introduction of hierarchical pores in zeolites, such as ZSM-5, has shown significant improvements in catalyst performance. These structures typically include smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface [10.1002/jctb.4686]. This arrangement enhances the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke, improves mass transfer, and increases overall stability [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_3].

5. Coke Formation and Accommodation: The pore structure plays a crucial role in coke formation and accommodation. Zeolite-supported catalysts have shown significantly less coke deposition over longer reaction times compared to Al2O3 supports [10.1002/anie.202003349]. Interestingly, even with substantial coke content (14.4%) after extended reaction time, zeolite catalysts maintained most of their microporous volume, suggesting that the pore structure can accommodate coke while preserving catalyst performance [10.1002/anie.202003349].

6. Support Composition: The chemical nature of the support also influences coke formation and catalyst performance. For instance, SiO2 supports showed better propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Al2O3, attributed to weaker metal-support interactions allowing for better alloying between Pt and Zn [10.1016/j.chempr.2020.10.008].

These findings have important implications for designing optimal and effective PDH catalysts:

1. Balancing pore size to maximize conversion while minimizing coke formation is crucial. A combination of micropores and mesopores in a hierarchical structure could provide an optimal balance.

2. Developing three-dimensional, interconnected pore networks can enhance reactant-catalyst contact and accessibility to active sites.

3. Incorporating uniform microporous structures with shape-selective properties can improve catalyst selectivity and stability.

4. Exploring hierarchical pore arrangements that combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities could optimize mass transfer and coke accommodation.

5. Considering the synergy between pore structure and active site distribution, particularly in materials with cation exchange capacity, can enhance overall catalyst performance.

6. Tailoring the support's chemical composition to minimize undesired metal-support interactions and promote desired alloy formations can further improve catalyst effectiveness and longevity.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive analysis of catalyst support pore structures in PDH reactions reveals the intricate interplay between various structural characteristics and their impact on catalyst performance. Moving forward, research efforts should focus on developing advanced hierarchical pore structures that optimize the balance between reactant diffusion, active site accessibility, and coke accommodation.

Future directions may include:

1. Exploring novel synthesis methods to create precisely controlled hierarchical pore structures with tailored pore size distributions and connectivity.

2. Investigating the potential of hybrid materials that combine the benefits of different support types, such as zeolite-mesoporous silica composites, to harness the advantages of multiple pore regimes.

3. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to study the dynamic changes in pore structures during PDH reactions, providing real-time insights into coke formation and accommodation processes.

4. Utilizing advanced computational modeling to predict optimal pore structures for specific reaction conditions and desired performance characteristics.

5. Exploring the potential of "smart" catalyst supports that can adapt their pore structures in response to reaction conditions, potentially through the use of stimuli-responsive materials.

6. Investigating the synergistic effects of pore structure optimization with other catalyst design strategies, such as bimetallic nanoparticle engineering and promoter addition, to develop next-generation PDH catalysts with superior performance and longevity.

These research avenues could lead to significant advancements in PDH catalyst design, potentially improving process efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing the sustainability of propylene production.
