Supports with wide pore size distribution allow coke to cover the external surface rather than the metallic surface, which can help maintain catalyst activity.\n\n2. Hierarchical pore arrangements: The introduction of hierarchical pores, such as in the ZQ zeolite, greatly improves the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke.

Pore size and distribution: A uniform pore size distribution with relatively large surface area favors the dispersion of metallic particles, enhancing catalyst performance. Supports with wide pore size distribution allow coke to cover the external surface rather than the metallic surface, which can help maintain catalyst activity.\n\n2. Hierarchical pore arrangements: The introduction of hierarchical pores, such as in the ZQ zeolite, greatly improves the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke. This structure typically includes smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface.\n\n3. Connectivity and accessibility: Hierarchical pore structures enhance the transport of reactants and products, improving catalytic activity and stability. They are more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations.\n\n4. Surface properties and acidity: The modified pore structure in ZQ led to changes in surface properties, including decreased acid content. This alteration in surface chemistry plays a role in improving the catalyst's coke accommodation capacity and resistance to coke formation.\n\n5. Metal particle stabilization: Hierarchical pores in catalysts like PtSnNa/ZQ inhibit the further agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, contributing to improved catalyst stability.\n\n6. Coke formation and accommodation: The modified pore structure significantly enhances the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke and resist its formation. This is evidenced by the lower amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially on the external surface of the support.\n\nThese relationships have important implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions:\n\n1.
