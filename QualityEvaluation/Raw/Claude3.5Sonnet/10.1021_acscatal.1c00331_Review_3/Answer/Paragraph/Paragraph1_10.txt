The pore structure characteristics of catalyst supports play a crucial role in determining the overall performance and longevity of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These structural features, including pore size distribution, volume, and connectivity, significantly influence coke formation and accommodation, which are critical factors affecting catalyst efficiency and deactivation. Larger pores can facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, potentially reducing coke accumulation, while smaller pores may provide higher surface area for active sites but risk rapid blockage. The intricate balance between these factors impacts not only the initial catalytic activity but also the catalyst's resistance to deactivation over time. Understanding these relationships is essential for designing optimal catalysts that can maintain high propylene yields while minimizing coking issues. Researchers are increasingly focusing on tailoring support structures to enhance coke tolerance and extend catalyst lifetimes, ultimately aiming to improve the economic viability and sustainability of PDH processes in industrial applications.
