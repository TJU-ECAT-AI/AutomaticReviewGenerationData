[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

[4] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles. But coke deposition still occurs, and currently used PtSn/alumina catalysts still require frequent and cumbersome regeneration steps to restore their catalytic activity."

"Conversely, the pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

"Hence, at this level, the effect of the pore network structure on coking and deactivation must be accounted for."

"Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to significant changes in pore network structure."

"Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."

"In addition, a percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."

"The original pore radius (ro) for the fresh catalyst particle is randomly assigned, but follows a log-normal distribution"

"The pore connectivity (Z) is kept the same for all inner nodes to simplify the pore network."

[1] "Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs."

[2] "N2 adsorption-desorption analyses show a slight decrease in microporous volume (ca. 0.015cm3g1) due to the partially occupied metal species in some void spaces of the zeolites, but sufficient microporous volumes (>0.09cm3g1) and areas (>229m2g1) are observed in metal-containing samples"

[3] "TG-DTA analyses demonstrated that after 400min on stream, the weight losses of coke deposition over spent Pt/Al2O3 and PtZn4/Al2O3 were 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively, which were much higher than those of Pt@S-1-H (2.5%) and PtZn4@S-1-H (1.5%) even after 1200min on stream"

[4] "The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H"

[5] "TEM images showed that most of the cokes were located on the outer surfaces of the zeolites"

"Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

"From the desorption branch, the pore size distribution was calculated by using the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) model."

"Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

"Table 1
Textural properties of the reduced catalysts measured by N2-sorption.
Catalyst Surface area (m2/g) Pore volume (ml/g) Pore size (BJH) (nm)"

"Catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, in general, increase in the following order: 1% Pt < 1% Pt0.29% Sn < 1% Pt0.53% Sn < 1% Pt1.67% Sn. The best coke tolerance is found with the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst which had the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content."

"Mesoporous alumina was synthesized by a solgel method."

[1] "Generally, rate and extent of coke formation increase with increasing acidic strength and concentration; coke yield diminishes with decreasing pore size"

[2] "In our findings, pore size affected mainly on coke yield when the coke amount (%wt/wt at TOS = 160 min) decreases in the following orders: 3% Pt-Al2O3 (19.0) > 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 (9.6) and 3% Pt-SBA-15 (9.7) > 3% Pt-SiO2 (5.5)."

[3] "To investigate the influence of diffusion limitations on the oxidation temperature of coke, 3% Pt-Al2O3-1 and 3% Pt-SiO2 catalysts having different pore sizes were prepared and deactivated under the same reaction conditions."

[4] "This observation implies that the influence of the pore sizes of the spent catalysts on air diffusion during the oxidation process does not shift the oxidation temperature of coke."

[5] "The pore diameters of spent 3% Pt-Al2O3, spent 3% Pt-SBA-15, spent 3% Pt-Al2O3-1, and spent 3% Pt-SiO2 were 7.53, 3.67, 4.59, and 1.0 nm, respectively"

[6] "However, influence of acidity is not easy to verify because the coke amount is limited by pore size."

[1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorptiondesorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X 0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The coke weight percentage generated during propane dehydrogenation ranged from 2.3 to 9.7. The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

[1] "We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation."

          [2] "Additionally, the stronger acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

          [3] "Therefore, the weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking behaviors."

[1] "The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials"

[2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."

[3] "TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15."

[4] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

[5] "The superiority of the microporous materials can be attributed to their intrinsic nature that includes but not limited to cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects and small three dimensional pores which may facilitate the reaction between active sites and reactant molecules."

[6] "The amount of coke content after 170 min on-stream was measured to be the highest on Pt-ZSM-5, as expected, followed by, though surprising, on Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Beta"

[7] "Accordingly, it appears that on support ZSM-5 and SBA-15 the undesired side reactions such as cracking, oligomerization, etc., which could produce coke precursors, compete with the dehydrogenation reaction. Whilst, these side reactions may not be significant under these experimental conditions on support Beta."

[8] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt supported zeolites could originate from the active sites that are associated with cation exchange sites and might be complemented by their three dimensional pore geometry."

[9] "On the other hand, large cylindrical pores which may not provide the required contact between the reactant and active sites located within the pores (that means a low degree of propane adsorption), and a lack of cation exchange sites in Pt-SBA-15 may have lead to its lower catalytic performance."

[1] "The pore structure of the support is another factor which has a significant role in coke formation."
          [2] "The Pt catalysts on the microporous support show better selectivity, stability, and lower coke amount than the counterpart on the mesoporous support."
          [3] "A support with more uniform, higher connected, and larger-sized pores could accommodate more cokes."
          [4] "The acidity of the support was decreased after the modification of the pore structure of ZSM-5 by introducing hierarchical-pores, which inhibits the formation of coke on the metal and improves the capacity of the support for coke."

[1] "With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface."

[2] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as an efficient support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Due to its large surface area coupled with the right channel properties, catalysts supported on ZSM-5 possess an enhanced capacity to accommodate coke."

[3] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."

[4] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."

[5] "Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, owing to the restriction of these hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the further agglomeration of platinum particles is inhibited during the reaction, which is advantage to the stability of the catalyst."

[6] "Zhang et al.21 compared different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for PtSn-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support were favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles."

[7] "As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 2080 nm. There are thus two kinds of hierarchical-pores appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals,28 accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ."

[8] "According to these effects, further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process is inhibited, leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. Moreover, by the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly. Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbonmetal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

[9] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

[10] "According to results found by Gao's group, catalyst supports with large pore size distribution were found to be more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations. Thus ZQ supported catalyst ought to show better resistance to coking during the reaction."

[11] "From Fig. 10, it can easily be seen that the total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support."

[1] "Compared with commercial alumina, the hierarchical nanoalumina benefited from its highly open structure, and the stable surface property showed a remarkable ability to improve the mass-transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalysts structural stability."

          [2] "The surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts with different loadings are 60.368.7 m2/g and 0.310.36 cm3/g, respectively. Following the improvement of Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process."

[1] "Taking advantage of the confinement effect of zeolite structures, subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters with a few atoms) can be generated and stabilized in the porous structures within zeolite crystallites"

[2] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."

[3] "Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites."

[4] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates"

[5] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst"

[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
