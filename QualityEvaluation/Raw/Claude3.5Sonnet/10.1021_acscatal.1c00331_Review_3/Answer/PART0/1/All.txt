Pore size: Smaller pores generally lead to higher propane conversion and catalytic activity. The order of activity decreases with increasing pore size: ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15. However, smaller pores (as in ZSM-5) also tend to promote more coke formation.\n\n2. Connectivity: Three-dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5 and Beta) perform better than one-dimensional mesoporous materials (SBA-15). This indicates that interconnected pore networks facilitate better reactant-catalyst interactions and provide better accessibility to active sites.\n\n3. Uniformity: While not explicitly discussed, the uniform microporous structure of zeolites appears to contribute to their superior performance compared to the larger, less uniform pores of SBA-15. This uniformity contributes to shape-selectivity effects, which can influence product distribution and coke formation.\n\n4. Hierarchical arrangements: The study did not directly address hierarchical pore structures, but the comparison between microporous and mesoporous materials suggests that a combination of different pore sizes could potentially optimize catalyst performance, balancing activity, selectivity, and coke resistance.\n\n5. Coke formation and accommodation: Interestingly, Pt-ZSM-5 (smallest pores) showed the highest coke formation, while Pt-Beta had the lowest. This suggests that pore size alone does not determine coke formation and that other factors like pore connectivity and shape selectivity play important roles. Pt-Beta exhibited better catalytic stability despite lower coke formation.\n\n6. Overall catalyst performance: Three-dimensional microporous materials (zeolites) outperform mesoporous materials in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. This is attributed to their intrinsic properties such as cation exchange sites, shape-selectivity effects, and small three-dimensional pores which facilitate reactions between active sites and reactant molecules.\n\nThese findings imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus on:\n- Balancing pore size to maximize conversion while minimizing coke formation\n- Utilizing three-dimensional pore networks to enhance reactant-catalyst contact and accessibility to active sites\n- Incorporating uniform microporous structures with shape-selective properties\n- Exploring hierarchical pore arrangements that combine the benefits of different pore sizes and connectivities\n- Considering the synergy between pore structure and active site distribution, particularly in materials with cation exchange capacity\n\nThe goal should be to create catalysts with well-connected, three-dimensional microporous structures with carefully tuned pore sizes that enhance reactant-catalyst contact while managing coke formation and providing stability.", "Chinese": "催化剂支撑孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：\n\n1. 孔径大小：较小的孔径通常导致更高的丙烷转化率和催化活性。活性随孔径增大而降低，顺序为：ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15。然而，较小的孔径（如ZSM-5）也倾向于促进更多的积碳形成。\n\n2. 连通性：三维微孔材料（ZSM-5和Beta）的性能优于一维介孔材料（SBA-15）。这表明互连的孔网络可以促进反应物与催化剂之间更好的相互作用，并提供更好的活性位点可及性。\n\n3. 均匀性：虽然没有明确讨论，但沸石的均匀微孔结构似乎比SBA-15的较大、较不均匀的孔隙结构贡献更多的优异性能。这种均匀性有助于形状选择性效应，可以影响产品分布和积碳形成。\n\n4. 层级排列：该研究没有直接涉及层级孔结构，但微孔和介孔材料的比较表明，不同孔径的组合可能会优化催化剂性能，平衡活性、选择性和抗积碳性。\n\n5. 积碳形成和容纳：有趣的是，Pt-ZSM-5（最小孔径）显示出最高的积碳形成，而Pt-Beta的积碳形成最低。这表明孔径大小并不是决定积碳形成的唯一因素，其他因素如孔隙连通性和形状选择性也起着重要作用。尽管积碳形成较低，Pt-Beta表现出更好的催化稳定性。\n\n6. 整体催化剂性能：三维微孔材料（沸石）在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于介孔材料。这归因于它们的固有特性，如阳离子交换位点、形状选择性效应和小型三维孔，这些特性有助于活性位点和反应分子之间的反应。\n\n这些发现意味着设计最佳PDH催化剂应该关注：\n- 平衡孔径大小，以最大化转化率同时最小化积碳形成\n- 利用三维孔网络来增强反应物与催化剂的接触和活性位点的可及性\n- 结合具有形状选择性的均匀微孔结构\n- 探索结合不同孔径和连通性优势的层级孔排列\n- 考虑孔结构和活性位点分布之间的协同作用，特别是在具有阳离子交换能力的材料中\n\n目标应该是创建具有精心调节的孔径大小的良好连接的三维微孔结构催化剂，以增强反应物-催化剂接触，同时管理积碳形成并提供稳定性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.micromeso.2009.05.031"},
