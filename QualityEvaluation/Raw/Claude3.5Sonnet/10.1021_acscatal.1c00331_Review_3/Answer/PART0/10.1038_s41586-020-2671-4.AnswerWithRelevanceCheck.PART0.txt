          [1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support813 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

[4] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles. But coke deposition still occurs, and currently used PtSn/alumina catalysts still require frequent and cumbersome regeneration steps to restore their catalytic activity."

          The literature provides insights into how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size and connectivity: The mesoporous zeolite support with three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores enhances catalytic performance by facilitating reactant and product diffusion. This improved mass transfer likely reduces coke formation and improves overall catalyst effectiveness.

2. Hierarchical arrangements: The zeolite support features a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure, which combines the benefits of both micropores and mesopores. This arrangement likely provides a balance between high surface area for active site dispersion and improved mass transfer properties.

3. Uniformity: While not explicitly discussed, the use of a structure-directing agent in zeolite synthesis suggests a degree of uniformity in the pore structure, which could contribute to consistent catalyst performance.

4. Metal dispersion: The mesoporous structure enables high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the pores, which can lead to improved catalyst utilization and potentially reduced coke formation.

5. Support composition: The shift from alumina to siliceous MFI zeolite as a support material suggests that the chemical nature of the support also plays a role in catalyst performance and durability.

6. Coke formation and accommodation: While the hierarchical pore structure likely helps mitigate coke formation and accumulation by providing more space for coke deposition without blocking active sites, the addition of Sn to Pt nanoparticles demonstrates an approach to reducing coke formation by diluting the Pt surface and breaking up coke-generating Pt ensembles.

These relationships imply that designing optimal PDH catalysts should focus on creating hierarchical pore structures with interconnected mesopores to balance diffusion and active site accessibility. Additionally, tailoring the support's chemical composition and incorporating appropriate metal combinations can further enhance catalyst performance and longevity by mitigating coke formation. Future catalyst design should aim to optimize these structural characteristics to achieve an ideal balance between reactant/product diffusion, metal dispersion, and coke resistance.

          文献为我们提供了催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的见解：

1. 孔径和连通性：具有三维互连介孔的介孔沸石载体通过促进反应物和产物的扩散来提高催化性能。这种改善的传质效果可能减少了积炭形成并提高了整体催化剂效率。

2. 分级排列：沸石载体具有微孔/介孔分级结构，结合了微孔和介孔的优点。这种排列可能在提供高比表面积以分散活性位点和改善传质性能之间取得平衡。

3. 均一性：虽然没有明确讨论，但在沸石合成中使用结构导向剂表明孔结构具有一定程度的均一性，这可能有助于保持一致的催化剂性能。

4. 金属分散：介孔结构使金属纳米粒子能够高度分散在孔内，这可能导致催化剂利用率的提高和潜在的积炭减少。

5. 载体组成：从氧化铝转向硅质MFI沸石作为载体材料表明，载体的化学性质也在催化剂性能和耐久性方面发挥作用。

6. 积炭形成和容纳：虽然分级孔结构可能通过为积炭沉积提供更多空间而不阻塞活性位点来帮助减轻积炭形成和积累，但向Pt纳米粒子中添加Sn展示了通过稀释Pt表面和破坏生成积炭的Pt集合体来减少积炭形成的方法。

这些关系意味着，设计最佳PDH催化剂应该关注创建具有互连介孔的分级孔结构，以平衡扩散和活性位点可及性。此外，调整载体的化学组成和结合适当的金属组合可以通过缓解积炭形成来进一步提高催化剂性能和寿命。未来的催化剂设计应该致力于优化这些结构特征，以在反应物/产物扩散、金属分散和抗积炭性能之间达到理想的平衡。
