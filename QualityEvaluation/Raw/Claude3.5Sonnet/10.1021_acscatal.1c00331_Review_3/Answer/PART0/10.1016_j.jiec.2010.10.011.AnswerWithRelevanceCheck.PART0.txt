          "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

"From the desorption branch, the pore size distribution was calculated by using the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) model."

"Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

"Table 1
Textural properties of the reduced catalysts measured by N2-sorption.
Catalyst Surface area (m2/g) Pore volume (ml/g) Pore size (BJH) (nm)"

"Catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, in general, increase in the following order: 1% Pt < 1% Pt0.29% Sn < 1% Pt0.53% Sn < 1% Pt1.67% Sn. The best coke tolerance is found with the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst which had the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content."

"Mesoporous alumina was synthesized by a solgel method."

          The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does offer some relevant insights:

1. Textural properties: The study measured surface area, pore volume, and pore size using N2-sorption techniques. Pore size distribution was calculated using the BJH model. This suggests these properties are considered important for catalyst performance.

2. Coke formation impact: Coking can decrease catalytic activity through two mechanisms: poisoning active sites and blocking pores, which limits reactant access to active sites.

3. Catalyst composition: Increasing tin content in PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts improved catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and coke tolerance. The 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst showed the best performance with the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content.

4. Support material: Mesoporous alumina was used as the catalyst support, synthesized by a sol-gel method.

While these points suggest that pore structure plays a role in catalyst performance and coke formation, the specific relationships between pore characteristics (size, connectivity, uniformity, hierarchical arrangements) and their impacts on PDH reactions are not detailed. To fully answer the question and provide insights for optimal catalyst design, further research would be needed to investigate these relationships more thoroughly.

          这篇文献并未提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能的全面信息。但是，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

1. 织构特性：研究使用N2吸附技术测量了比表面积、孔体积和孔径。孔径分布是使用BJH模型计算的。这表明这些性质被认为对催化剂性能很重要。

2. 积碳影响：积碳可以通过两种机制降低催化活性：毒化活性位点和阻塞孔道，从而限制反应物接触活性位点。

3. 催化剂组成：增加PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中的锡含量可以提高催化活性、丙烯选择性和抗积碳能力。1% Pt1.67% Sn催化剂表现最佳，具有最慢的失活速率和最低的积碳含量。

4. 载体材料：使用溶胶-凝胶法合成了介孔氧化铝作为催化剂载体。

虽然这些点表明孔结构在催化剂性能和积碳形成中起作用，但孔特征（尺寸、连通性、均匀性、层级结构）与其对PDH反应影响之间的具体关系并未详细说明。要全面回答这个问题并为最佳催化剂设计提供见解，需要进行进一步研究，更深入地调查这些关系。
