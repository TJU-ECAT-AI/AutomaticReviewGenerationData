          [1] "Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and outstanding thermal stability are regarded as ideal supports for anchoring small MNPs."

[2] "N2 adsorption-desorption analyses show a slight decrease in microporous volume (ca. 0.015cm3g1) due to the partially occupied metal species in some void spaces of the zeolites, but sufficient microporous volumes (>0.09cm3g1) and areas (>229m2g1) are observed in metal-containing samples"

[3] "TG-DTA analyses demonstrated that after 400min on stream, the weight losses of coke deposition over spent Pt/Al2O3 and PtZn4/Al2O3 were 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively, which were much higher than those of Pt@S-1-H (2.5%) and PtZn4@S-1-H (1.5%) even after 1200min on stream"

[4] "The coke content of spent PtZn4@S-1-H reached 14.4% after 13000min on stream; however, a microporous volume decrease of less than 10% was observed for spent PtZn4@S-1-H"

[5] "TEM images showed that most of the cokes were located on the outer surfaces of the zeolites"

          The literature provides insights into how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Zeolites with ordered microporous structures are considered ideal supports for anchoring small metal nanoparticles due to their thermal stability and ability to confine particles.

2. The microporous nature of zeolites helps limit coke formation. Compared to Al2O3 supports, zeolite-supported catalysts showed significantly less coke deposition over longer reaction times.

3. Even with substantial coke content (14.4%) after extended reaction time, the zeolite catalyst maintained most of its microporous volume, with less than 10% decrease. This suggests the pore structure can accommodate coke while preserving catalyst performance.

4. Most coke was found on the outer surfaces of zeolites, indicating that the internal pore structure may help prevent extensive internal coking.

5. The ordered microporous structure of zeolites appears to contribute to better catalyst stability and longevity compared to traditional Al2O3 supports.

These findings imply that the uniform microporous structure of zeolites, with their ability to confine metal particles and accommodate coke mainly on external surfaces, leads to improved catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions compared to traditional supports. The pore structure plays a crucial role in limiting internal coke formation and maintaining accessibility to active sites. Designing catalysts with optimized pore structures that balance confinement effects with accessibility could further enhance PDH catalyst performance.

          文献为我们提供了一些关于催化剂载体孔结构如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的见解：

1. 由于沸石具有有序的微孔结构和出色的热稳定性，被认为是固定小型金属纳米粒子的理想载体。

2. 沸石的微孔性质有助于限制焦炭形成。与Al2O3载体相比，沸石负载的催化剂在更长的反应时间内显示出明显更少的焦炭沉积。

3. 即使在长时间反应后焦炭含量高达14.4%，沸石催化剂仍保持了大部分微孔体积，减少不到10%。这表明孔结构可以容纳焦炭，同时保持催化剂性能。

4. 大部分焦炭被发现在沸石的外表面，表明内部孔结构可能有助于防止大量内部结焦。

5. 与传统的Al2O3载体相比，沸石的有序微孔结构似乎有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

这些发现意味着，与传统支撑相比，沸石的均匀微孔结构能够限制金属粒子并主要在外表面容纳积炭，从而在PDH反应中提高催化剂性能和稳定性。孔结构在限制内部积炭形成和保持活性位点可及性方面起着至关重要的作用。设计具有优化孔结构的催化剂，平衡限制效应和可及性，可以进一步增强PDH催化剂的性能。
