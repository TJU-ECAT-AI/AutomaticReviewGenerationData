          [1] "The textural properties of calcined catalysts were determined by N2 adsorptiondesorption technique, and their numerical values of measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared to Pt/SBA-15 and Pt/Al2O3, Pt/CeO2, Pt/MgO, and Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2 catalysts exhibited much lower surface areas and large pore sizes (Table 1)."

[2] "In Table 1, the catalysts with the high surface area, such as Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15, showed a high initial propane conversion (X 0) greater than 40% while the catalysts with low surface area, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO had low initial propane conversion less than 20%."

[3] "The coke weight percentage generated during propane dehydrogenation ranged from 2.3 to 9.7. The catalysts with low initial conversions, such as Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO contained relatively low coke amounts after the reaction."

          The literature provides limited information on how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, some relationships can be inferred:

1. Surface area appears to have a significant impact on initial propane conversion. Catalysts with higher surface areas (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SBA-15) showed higher initial propane conversion rates (>40%) compared to catalysts with lower surface areas (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO), which had lower initial conversion rates (<20%).

2. Pore size seems to be inversely related to surface area, with catalysts having larger pore sizes also exhibiting lower surface areas.

3. There appears to be a correlation between initial conversion rates, surface area, and coke formation. Catalysts with lower surface areas and lower initial conversion rates (Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2, Pt/CeO2, and Pt/MgO) showed lower coke formation after the reaction.

These observations suggest that optimizing catalyst design for PDH reactions involves balancing surface area and pore size to maximize initial activity while minimizing coke formation. Higher surface area catalysts may provide better initial performance but may also be more susceptible to coke formation and subsequent deactivation.

The study does not provide specific information on the effects of pore connectivity, uniformity, or hierarchical arrangements on catalyst performance or coke formation in PDH reactions. To design optimal and effective catalysts, further research would be needed to investigate how these specific pore structure characteristics influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

          该文献对催化剂载体孔结构的特定特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能提供了有限的信息。然而，可以推断出一些关系：

1. 表面积似乎对初始丙烷转化率有显著影响。表面积较高的催化剂(Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SBA-15)显示出较高的初始丙烷转化率(>40%)，而表面积较低的催化剂(Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO)的初始转化率较低(<20%)。

2. 孔径似乎与表面积呈反比关系，具有较大孔径的催化剂也表现出较低的表面积。

3. 初始转化率、表面积和积碳形成之间似乎存在相关性。表面积较低和初始转化率较低的催化剂(Pt/Ce0.63Zr0.37O2、Pt/CeO2和Pt/MgO)在反应后显示出较低的积碳形成。

这些观察结果表明，为PDH反应优化催化剂设计涉及平衡表面积和孔径，以最大化初始活性，同时最小化积碳形成。表面积较高的催化剂可能提供更好的初始性能，但也可能更容易形成积碳并随后失活。

该研究并未提供有关孔连通性、均匀性或分层排列对PDH反应中催化剂性能或积碳形成影响的具体信息。为了设计最优和有效的催化剂，需要进一步研究这些特定的孔结构特征如何影响PDH反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。
