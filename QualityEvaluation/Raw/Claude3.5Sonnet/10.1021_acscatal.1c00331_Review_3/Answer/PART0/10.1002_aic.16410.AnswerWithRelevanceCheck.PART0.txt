          "Conversely, the pore network structure significantly affects the capacity to contain coke."

"Hence, at this level, the effect of the pore network structure on coking and deactivation must be accounted for."

"Coke narrows and eventually plugs pores during reaction, leading to significant changes in pore network structure."

"Some large pores can be surrounded by plugged pores and then become inaccessible to reactants, which further adds to the complexity of the coking process."

"In addition, a percolation phenomenon occurs when the fraction of unplugged or open pores drops below a critical threshold, in which the previously connected, particle-spanning cluster of open pores becomes disconnected."

"The original pore radius (ro) for the fresh catalyst particle is randomly assigned, but follows a log-normal distribution"

"The pore connectivity (Z) is kept the same for all inner nodes to simplify the pore network."

          The characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors include:

1. Pore size: Larger pores can accommodate more coke before becoming completely blocked, while smaller pores may limit coke formation but are more susceptible to blockage. The model uses a log-normal distribution of pore radii, which affects diffusion, reaction rates, and coke deposition.

2. Connectivity: Higher pore connectivity can potentially maintain catalyst activity for longer periods by providing alternative pathways for reactants and products when some pores become blocked. The model uses a simplified approach with uniform connectivity for inner nodes.

3. Uniformity: Non-uniform pore structures can lead to uneven coke distribution. The random assignment of pore radii introduces non-uniformity, which can lead to preferential coke deposition and localized deactivation.

4. Hierarchical arrangements: While not explicitly mentioned in all quotes, the combination of different pore sizes and connectivity can create hierarchical structures that influence coke distribution and catalyst performance. These structures could potentially balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion.

As coking progresses, it narrows and eventually plugs pores, leading to significant changes in the pore network structure. This process not only covers active sites but also increases diffusion resistance and can make some active sites inaccessible, particularly when large pores become surrounded by plugged pores.

A critical phenomenon is the percolation effect, where a sudden disconnection of the pore network occurs when the fraction of open pores drops below a certain threshold. This can cause a dramatic change in catalyst performance.

Implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts include:

1. Developing pore structures that balance coke accommodation and reactant diffusion.
2. Creating robust pore networks that maintain connectivity even as some pores become blocked.
3. Designing catalyst particles with hierarchical pore structures to optimize both reaction and mass transfer.
4. Considering the distribution of active sites within the pore network to maximize catalyst utilization.
5. Engineering pore structures that promote more uniform coke deposition to extend catalyst lifetime.
6. Tailoring pore size distribution to balance coke accommodation capacity with maintenance of active site accessibility.
7. Designing catalysts to delay reaching the percolation threshold, perhaps by incorporating more robust transport pathways.

Understanding and manipulating these pore structure characteristics can lead to the development of more coke-resistant and longer-lasting catalysts for PDH reactions, potentially improving process efficiency and reducing the frequency of catalyst regeneration or replacement.

          催化剂载体孔结构的特征对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响。关键因素包括：

1. 孔径：较大的孔可以在完全堵塞之前容纳更多的积碳，而较小的孔可能限制积碳形成，但更容易堵塞。模型使用对数正态分布的孔径，这影响扩散、反应速率和积碳沉积。

2. 连通性：更高的孔连通性可能通过在某些孔被堵塞时为反应物和产物提供替代路径，从而使催化剂活性保持更长时间。模型对内部节点使用统一的连通性简化方法。

3. 均匀性：不均匀的孔结构可能导致不均匀的积碳分布。随机分配的孔径引入了非均匀性，这可能导致优先积碳沉积和局部失活。

4. 层次结构：虽然并非所有引用都明确提到，但不同孔径和连通性的组合可以创建影响积碳分布和催化剂性能的层次结构。这些结构可能平衡积碳容纳和反应物扩散。

随着积碳的进行，它会使孔变窄并最终堵塞，导致孔网络结构发生显著变化。这个过程不仅覆盖活性位点，还增加扩散阻力，并可能使某些活性位点无法接触，特别是当大孔被堵塞的孔包围时。

一个关键现象是渗流效应，当开放孔的比例降至某个阈值以下时，孔网络会突然断开连接。这可能导致催化剂性能的显著变化。

这些关系对设计最佳和有效催化剂的启示包括：

1. 开发平衡积碳容纳和反应物扩散的孔结构。
2. 创建即使某些孔被堵塞也能保持连通性的稳健孔网络。
3. 设计具有层次孔结构的催化剂颗粒，以优化反应和质量传递。
4. 考虑孔网络内活性位点的分布，以最大化催化剂利用率。
5. 设计促进更均匀积碳沉积的孔结构，以延长催化剂寿命。
6. 定制孔径分布以平衡积碳容纳能力和保持活性位点可访问性。
7. 设计催化剂以延迟达到渗流阈值，可能通过纳入更具鲁棒性的传输路径。

理解和操纵这些孔结构特征可以导致开发出更耐积碳和更长寿命的PDH反应催化剂，可能提高过程效率并减少催化剂再生或更换的频率。
