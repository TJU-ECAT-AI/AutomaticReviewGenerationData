          [1] "With supports having a wide pore size distribution, coke could more easily cover the external surface of the support instead of the metallic surface."

[2] "ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as an efficient support for PtSn-based catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Due to its large surface area coupled with the right channel properties, catalysts supported on ZSM-5 possess an enhanced capacity to accommodate coke."

[3] "By the introduction of hierarchical-pores in ZQ, the pore structure was changed, the acid content was decreased, and the surface properties were promoted. These modifications to zeolite greatly improved the capacity of catalysts to accommodate coke."

[4] "The new hierarchical-porous ZSM-5 support (ZQ) exhibits enhanced capacity to accommodate coke, and PtSnNa/ZQ enabled better propane conversion and improved catalyst stability."

[5] "Compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, owing to the restriction of these hierarchical-pores in PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst, the further agglomeration of platinum particles is inhibited during the reaction, which is advantage to the stability of the catalyst."

[6] "Zhang et al.21 compared different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for PtSn-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. They found that a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the support were favorable for the dispersion of metallic particles."

[7] "As observed in Fig. 3(b), for the pore size distribution in ZQ, there is a main distribution peak centered at 3 nm, and a small shoulder obtained in the region of 2080 nm. There are thus two kinds of hierarchical-pores appearing in the ZQ sample. The smaller ones are intracrystalline mesopores inside the crystals,28 accounting for the main part of the pore distribution in ZQ; while the other large pores are mesopores or even macropores appearing on the surface of ZQ."

[8] "According to these effects, further agglomeration of Pt particles during the reaction process is inhibited, leading to an increase in the stability of the catalyst. Moreover, by the introduction of these hierarchical-pores, the acidity of ZQ material is modified significantly. Therefore, during the reaction, the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbonmetal bonds, the adsorbed species are more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

[9] "Consequently, this implies that PtSnNa/ZQ catalyst exhibits better capacity to accommodate coke and better resistance against the formation of coke."

[10] "According to results found by Gao's group, catalyst supports with large pore size distribution were found to be more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations. Thus ZQ supported catalyst ought to show better resistance to coking during the reaction."

[11] "From Fig. 10, it can easily be seen that the total amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ is much less than that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially for the coke deposits on the external surface of the support."

          The various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures significantly influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Pore size and distribution: A uniform pore size distribution with relatively large surface area favors the dispersion of metallic particles, enhancing catalyst performance. Supports with wide pore size distribution allow coke to cover the external surface rather than the metallic surface, which can help maintain catalyst activity.

2. Hierarchical pore arrangements: The introduction of hierarchical pores, such as in the ZQ zeolite, greatly improves the catalyst's capacity to accommodate coke. This structure typically includes smaller intracrystalline mesopores (around 3 nm) and larger mesopores or macropores (20-80 nm) on the surface.

3. Connectivity and accessibility: Hierarchical pore structures enhance the transport of reactants and products, improving catalytic activity and stability. They are more effective in overcoming diffusion and mass transfer limitations.

4. Surface properties and acidity: The modified pore structure in ZQ led to changes in surface properties, including decreased acid content. This alteration in surface chemistry plays a role in improving the catalyst's coke accommodation capacity and resistance to coke formation.

5. Metal particle stabilization: Hierarchical pores in catalysts like PtSnNa/ZQ inhibit the further agglomeration of platinum particles during the reaction, contributing to improved catalyst stability.

6. Coke formation and accommodation: The modified pore structure significantly enhances the catalyst's ability to accommodate coke and resist its formation. This is evidenced by the lower amount of coke deposits on PtSnNa/ZQ compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5, especially on the external surface of the support.

These relationships have important implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Develop supports with hierarchical pore structures to enhance coke accommodation, improve mass transfer, and increase catalyst stability.
2. Optimize pore size distribution to balance metal dispersion, reactant/product diffusion, and coke resistance.
3. Consider the interplay between pore structure and surface acidity to achieve desired catalytic performance and coke resistance.
4. Design pore structures that restrict metal particle agglomeration during reactions while facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites.
5. Focus on creating a balance between micropores, mesopores, and macropores to maximize catalytic performance and longevity.

By carefully engineering catalyst support pore structures with these factors in mind, it is possible to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions with improved resistance to coking and enhanced overall performance.

          催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能有显著影响：

1. 孔径和分布：均匀的孔径分布和较大的比表面积有利于金属颗粒的分散，提高催化剂性能。具有宽孔径分布的载体允许积碳覆盖外表面而非金属表面，这有助于维持催化剂活性。

2. 分级孔结构：引入分级孔结构（如ZQ沸石）大大提高了催化剂容纳积碳的能力。这种结构通常包括较小的晶内介孔（约3纳米）和表面上较大的介孔或大孔（20-80纳米）。

3. 连通性和可达性：分级孔结构增强了反应物和产物的传输，提高了催化活性和稳定性。它们更有效地克服了扩散和传质限制。

4. 表面性质和酸度：ZQ中改进的孔结构导致表面性质的变化，包括酸含量的降低。这种表面化学性质的改变在提高催化剂积碳容纳能力和抗积碳形成方面起到了作用。

5. 金属颗粒稳定性：PtSnNa/ZQ等催化剂中的分级孔抑制了反应过程中铂颗粒的进一步团聚，有助于提高催化剂稳定性。

6. 积碳形成和容纳：改进的孔结构显著提高了催化剂容纳积碳和抗积碳形成的能力。这从PtSnNa/ZQ比PtSnNa/ZSM-5有更少的积碳沉积量（特别是在载体的外表面）得到证实。

这些关系对设计PDH反应的最佳和有效催化剂有重要启示：

1. 开发具有分级孔结构的载体，以增强积碳容纳能力、改善传质和提高催化剂稳定性。
2. 优化孔径分布，以平衡金属分散、反应物/产物扩散和抗积碳能力。
3. 考虑孔结构与表面酸度之间的相互作用，以实现所需的催化性能和抗积碳能力。
4. 设计能够限制反应过程中金属颗粒团聚的孔结构，同时促进积碳前体物远离活性位点的迁移。
5. 专注于创造微孔、介孔和大孔之间的平衡，以最大化催化性能和寿命。

通过考虑这些因素仔细设计催化剂载体的孔结构，可以开发出更高效、更稳定的PDH反应催化剂，具有更好的抗积碳能力和更高的整体性能。
