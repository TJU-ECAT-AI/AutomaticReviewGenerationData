Single-atom Pt in intermetallics as an ultrastable
and selective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation

Propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) requires high reaction tempera-
tures to obtain sufficient propylene yields, which results to prominent catalyst deactivation
due to coke formation. Developing highly stable catalysts for PDH without deactivation even
at high temperatures is of great interest and benefit for industry. Here, we report that single-
atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective
catalyst for PDH at high temperatures. Intermetallic PtGa displays three-hold-Pt ensembles
and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface, the former of which can
be selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition. The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits
30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 C for 96 h without lowering the
performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while
effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically
improves the selectivity and stability.

P
ropylene is one of the most important building blocks for
the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as
polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals1.
The supply of propylene has been reduced because of the recent
shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to
shale-based ethane. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH)
using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose
technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene
production13. Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction tem-
peratures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient
propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to
coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh
conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be
regenerated continuously or in short cycles. Although a number
of literatures on catalytic PDH have been reported to this day, no
catalyst that exhibits high catalytic activity, selectivity, and day-
long stability at high temperatures (600 C) has been developed
to the best of our knowledge15. Developing a catalyst to meet this
demanding task is of a great challenge in pure and applied
chemistry.
Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by
the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or
undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C)
scissions and the subsequent coke formation610. For Pt-based
catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-
dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis1. The iso-
lation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these unde-
sired side reactions in PDH11. For instance, alloying of active
main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly
typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to
dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and
stability1. However, it is difficult to completely isolate Pt atoms by
the conventional alloying approach. Single-atom1215 and single-
atom alloy11,16 catalysts are also effective tools to use isolated Pt,
where active metals are atomically dispersed on an oxide support
and isolated by excess amount of 11 group metal like Cu,
respectively. However, it is difficult to apply them to high-
temperature reactions such as PDH due to its insufficient thermal
stability: Pt atoms17 or alloy nanoparticles11,16 without spatial
separation13 are easily aggregated to form larger nanoparticles at
very high temperatures.
A possible candidate to solve this challenge is single-atom-like
isolated Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic compounds.
For instance, the 1:1 compound of Pt and Ga with cubic
P213 space group has thermal stability (ΔHf = 55.6 kJ/mol1)
much
greater
than
typical
random
alloys
(10 < ΔHf 
0 kJ mol1) and a unique structure for this purpose as shown in
Fig. 1 (refs. 18,19). The stable (111) surface of PtGa has four
different terminations displaying isolated and threefold Pt and Ga
sites (hereafter signed Pt1, Ga1, Pt3, and Ga3). Here, the Ga3
moiety can be regarded as a matrix to support the isolated Pt1
atom; therefore, it may be possible to describe the Pt1 site as
single-atom Pt. Note that there are two enantiomeric forms of
PtGa unit cell (PtGa:A and PtGa:B, the former is shown in Fig. 1),
because the space group P213 is chiral. In an analogous system of
PdGa (space group P213), such surface termination (Pd3 and Pd1,
which were described as trimer and single atom, respectively) has
actually been observed by surface science techniques20,21. For the
PdGa system, Pd3 is known to catalyze semihydrogenation of
acetylene more selectively than Pd1 (ref. 20). For PtGa in PDH,
however, the Pt3 site is expected to be more active for further
CH(C) scissions. Therefore, some modification that makes only
Pt3 sites disabled while Pt1 sites available for the reaction is
needed for achieving highly selective and stable PDH.
In this study, we design Pb-modified PtGa where the threefold
Pt is selectively blocked by Pb deposition while the single-atom Pt
remains intact (Fig. 1c). As demonstrated later, the convex Pt1 site
is unfavorable geometrically and energetically for Pb deposition.
We prepare SiO2-supported PtGa and PtGaPb (Pt/Pb = 2) cat-
alysts by an impregnation method (reduced by H2 at 700 C) and
test in PDH at high temperatures (600 or 650 C; note that it is
lower than the preparation temperature). Here, we show a dif-
ferent type of single-atom Pt and its outstandingly high catalytic
performance in PDH at high temperature.

electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of PtGaPb/SiO2
with a single nanoparticle. A crystal structure with interplanar
distances of 2.07 and 2.25 Å and dihedral angle of 56 was
observed, which agreed with those of (211) and (20
1) planes of
intermetallic PtGa viewed along with [1
42] direction22 (Fig. 2b).
The particle size distribution was narrow (mostly 1.53 nm,
Supplementary Fig. 1) with an average of 2.8  0.6 nm. The ele-
mental map acquired by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
showed that Pt and Ga were homogeneously distributed in each
nanoparticle with approximately 1:1 ratio (Fig. 2c). Similar
results of the HAADF-STEM-EDX analyses were also obtained
for PtGa/SiO2 (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Note 1). On
the contrary, the Pb distribution in PtGaPb/SiO2 was focused on
the shell part of nanoparticles (areas 1 and 2 in Fig. 2c). Con-
sidering that the Pb content in the whole nanoparticle (area 1) is
lower than those fed in the catalyst (Pt/Pb = 2), a part of Pb may
present on SiO2 support. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis with Ar+ sputtering revealed that the Pt4f7/2-binding
energy of PtGaPb was lower than that of PtGa (due to ligand
effect of Pb)23, but came close immediately after several sput-
tering (Fig. 2d, see Supplementary Fig. 3 for the spectra). This
result strongly supports that Pb is located at the surface region of
PtGa nanoparticles. We also performed X-ray adsorption fine
structure (XAFS) analysis (see Supplementary Notes 2 and 3,
Supplementary Figs. 47, and Supplementary Table 1 for XAFS
analysis: Pt LIII-edge X-ray adsorption near edge spectra, exten-
ded XAFS (EXAFS) raw oscillations, EXAFS curve fits, magnitude
of Fourier transform of EXAFS, and details of the curve fit).
PtGa scattering with 2.50  0.01 Å was observed for PtGaPb,
which is consistent finely with the interatomic distance of the
nearest Pt and Ga in PtGa (2.499 Å)22. This result suggests that
Pb atoms are not substituted into the bulk of PtGa to increase the
lattice constant. PtPb scattering was also observed with a small
coordination number of 1.0, which indicates that the surface Pt
sites are partly blocked by Pb deposition. CO pulse chemisorption
experiment supported the partial coverage of surface Pt, where Pt
dispersion decreased from 9.9% to 5.9% upon the Pb modification
to PtGa/SiO2 (Supplementary Table 2).
To
obtain
further
information
about
the
surface
of
PtGaPb/SiO2, we then performed Fourier-transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy with CO adsorption at 196 C (Fig. 3). For
PtGa/SiO2, two peaks appeared at 2078 and 1885 cm1 at the
initial stage, which are assigned to stretching vibration of CO
adsorbed on Pt with on-top and threefold modes, respectively21.
Upon the increase in CO pressure (PCO), the threefold CO
disappeared and the intensity of the on-top CO increased with an
appearance of a small shoulder feature at around 2050 cm1. This
change could be attributed to the migration of threefold CO to
on-top CO on the Pt3 site due to the increase of CO coverage. The
new shoulder at around 2050 cm1 might be assigned to on-top
CO adsorbed on Pt1 site21. On the contrary, for PtGaPb/SiO2,
only a single symmetric adsorption band appeared at 2040 cm1
with lower intensity even at saturation coverage, which implies
that the Pt3 sites are blocked by Pb while the remaining Pt1 sites
are open for CO adsorption. We then simulated the theoretical
νC=O for the suggested conformations by density functional
theory (DFT) calculations (see Supplementary Fig. 8 for the
detailed structures and νC=O values). The calculated νC=O values
were consistent finely (on-top CO) or roughly (threefold CO)
with the corresponding experimental values (Fig. 3, vertical
lines), which strongly supports the assignment mentioned above.
The observed trend agreed also with a relevant system of
CO adsorption on PdGa:B(111) monitored by surface science
techniques21. Only a slight red-shift in νC=O (2043 to 2037 cm1)
was suggested when Pb was added near the Pt1 site, likely because
of electron-enriched Pt by the ligand effect of Pb as observed in
Fig. 2d. Thus, we successfully prepared an ideal catalyst for PDH
with single-atom-like isolated Pt without any PtPt ensembles.
Catalytic performance in PDH. Next, we tested the catalytic
performances of the prepared catalysts in PDH at 600 C (Fig. 4),
in which the equilibrium propylene yield in this reaction condi-
tion was approximately 60% (Supplementary Fig. 9). Although
PtGa exhibited high conversion and selectivity at the initial stage
(40% conv., 99.1% sel. at 0.5 h), conversion gradually decreased
below half of its initial value within 50 h. Conversely, PtGaPb
retained high conversion and excellent selectivity (>30% conv.,
>99.6% sel.) for 50 h even under the harsh condition. It should be

noted that almost no deactivation was observed even at 96 h
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Thus, the Pb modification to PtGa
significantly improved the stability and selectivity. We achieved
the long-term, continuous, and highly selective propylene pro-
duction in PDH at high temperatures without deactivation (>580
C: see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 and Supplementary Fig. 11
for comparison with literatures; deactivation rate constant was
defined in Supplementary Note 4). We also tested Pt3Sn catalyst,
the well-known catalyst selective for PDH1,7, which gave lower
conversion, selectivity, and stability (higher deactivation rate,
Supplementary Table 5) than PtGa, highlighting the out-
standingly high catalytic performance of PtGaPb. The spent
catalysts were then analyzed by temperature-programed oxida-
tion (TPO) and the HAADF-STEM-EDX analysis. PtGa and
Pt3Sn showed coke combustion peaks in their TPO profiles, while
PtGaPb gave no peak (Supplementary Fig. 12). This is consistent
with the stability trend in Fig. 4 and suggests that the coke for-
mation process is strictly inhibited. The HAADF-STEM-EDX
analysis revealed that, despite the long-term operation (50 h) in
the harsh condition, PtGaPb retained its small particles sizes
(flesh: 2.8  0.6 nm, spent: 3.0  0.6 nm), intermetallic structure,
and elemental distribution (Supplementary Fig. 13, Supplemen-
tary Note 5), demonstrating the high thermal stability and
resistance to sintering. The stability test was also conducted at
650 C, where PtGaPb retained high conversion (3738%) for
several hours and then gradually decreased to approximately 20%
over 50 h (Supplementary Note 6, Supplementary Fig. 14). The
gradual deactivation can be attributed to the contribution of
thermal (noncatalytic) cracking24. This was confirmed by a
control experiment using SiO2, in which small amount of C1 and
C2 were formed at 650 C, while that was negligible at 600 C
(Supplementary Fig. 15). Other bimetallic combinations that have
been reported to be effective for PDH (PtSn (ref. 25) and Pt3In
(ref. 8); see Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 16 for
details and their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, respectively)
were also tested at 600 C. However, they all showed deactivation
trends similar to that of Pt3Sn (Supplementary Fig. 17, Supple-
mentary Table 5). Considering that PtGa (Pt/Ga = 3) gave
higher deactivation rate and lower selectivity than PtGa, using 1:1
PtGa phase is a significant factor to develop a highly efficient
catalytic system for PDH (Supplementary Fig. 17, Supplementary
Table 5). When the modifier for PtGa was changed from Pb to
other metals such as In or Sn, no positive effects on activity and
selectivity were obtained (Supplementary Fig. 14). We also tested
the recyclability of PtGaPb catalyst (Supplementary Note 8,
Supplementary Fig. 18). The spent PtGaPb catalyst could be
regenerated by O2 treatment to recover the original catalytic
performance
after
some
induction
period,
whereas
some
other bimetallic or trimetallic Sn-containing catalysts (Pt3Sn,
PtSn, and PtGaSn) did not (Supplementary Fig. 19). Therefore,
the combination of intermetallic PtGa and the Pb modification is
suitable for stabilizing single-atom-like isolated Pt at high tem-
perature. This is probably because (1) PtGa itself is thermo-
dynamically
stable
(ΔHf = 55.6 kJ mol1)18,19
and
(2)
the
atomic radius26 of Pb (1.80 Å) is much larger than those of Pt
(1.35 Å) and Ga (1.30 Å): the diffusion of Pb into the bulk of PtGa
is likely to be unfavorable even at 600 C. Although several
researchers have pointed that Ga works as a good promotor for
Pt-based PDH as well as other typical element such as Sn or In
(refs. 2733), our results indicate that the geometry and appro-
priate design of an active site is more significant rather than the
individual chemical property of the additive element, that is, Pt
should be strictly isolated. We also surveyed various Pt/Pb ratios
and metal oxides as catalyst supports, which confirmed that
PtGaPb/SiO2 (Pt/Pb = 2) was the best (Supplementary Notes 9
and 10, Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21). Ga itself has also been
known to be active for PDH34. However, a control experiment
using Ga/SiO2 at 650 C (Supplementary Fig. 22) showed very low
conversion (<3%), indicating the negligible contribution of Ga
itself to the catalysis of much more active Pt-based materials.
DFT calculations. Finally, we conducted DFT calculations for the
step-wise CH scissions of propane to clarify the detailed prop-
erty of isolated Pt for selective PDH. Figure 5 summarizes the
reaction scheme of PDH and the calculated energy barrier of each
step (Ex: x = 1, 2, 3, and d; see Supplementary Figs. 2325,
Supplementary Fig. 26, and Supplementary Table 6 for the
detailed structures, energy diagram, and summarized activation
energies, respectively). The adsorbed propylene (C3H6(a)) formed
via the first and second CH scissions undergoes desorption to
gas phase (C3H6(g)) or further (third) CH scission to trigger
undesired side reactions610. Here, propylene selectivity depends
on the difference in the two energy barriers (ΔE = E3 Ed, sha-
ded part in Fig. 5): the larger ΔE is, the higher the selectivity is.
PtGa-Pt3 gave ΔE of 35.9 kJ mol1, which was slightly larger than
that of Pt3Sn(111) (24.1 kJ mol1). Interestingly, PtGa-Pt1 having
the isolated Pt showed much larger ΔE of 64.9 kJ mol1. This is
due to the remarkably high E3 (173.2 kJ mol1) even though E1
(typically the rate-determining step of PDH) and Ed did not differ
significantly from those of PtGa-Pt3 and Pt3Sn-Pt3 sites. The
specifically high E3 could be attributed to the molecular rotation
from lying 1,2-π-C3H6 to vertically standing 2-σ-C3H5 con-
formations occurring at the convex Pt1 site (Supplementary
Fig. 25c). Because of the molecular rotation and long PtPt dis-
tance between the Pt1 site and the nearest neighboring Pt3 site
(3.06 Å), the hydrogen atom involved in the third CH scission
has to migrate a long distance toward the final state. The energy
required for such an unfavorable path becomes significantly high.
We also estimated the theoretical propylene selectivity based on

the Arrhenius equation with ΔE (see Supplementary Note 11 for
details), which are listed in Table 1 with the corresponding
experimental values. The calculated values and their order were
consistent with the experimental results, which demonstrates the
validity of our calculation model. Thus, our calculation success-
fully reproduced the experimental trends in selectivity. The high
propylene selectivity of Pt1 sites minimizes the accumulation of
coke, which leads to the outstandingly high catalyst stability.
Finally, we investigated the affinity of Pb deposition to several Pt
and Ga sites. Pb atoms adsorbed stably on the Pt3, Ga3, and
concave Pt1 (in PtGa-Pt3 termination) sites with large adsorption
energies (462 to 337 kJ mol1, Supplementary Fig. 27), while
could not on the convex Pt1 site: the Pb atom placed on the top of
the Pt1 site migrated downward during structure optimization.
This result indicates that the convex Pt1 site is unfavorable for Pb
deposition geometrically and energetically.
Discussion
In summary, we designed and prepared the PtGaPb/SiO2 cata-
lyst for highly selective PDH, in which threefold hollow Pt3
ensembles were successfully blocked by Pb deposition, while the
single-atom-like isolated Pt1 sites remained. The isolated Pt1 is
highly selective (99.6%) for propylene production and the catalyst
is outstandingly stable for long-term operation at high tempera-
ture (96 h, 600 C). The catalytic performance in PDH is much
superior to those of the reported systems. The combination of (1)
the specific crystal structure of intermetallic PtGa providing iso-
lated Pt, (2) its thermal stability, and (3) the large atomic size of
Pb enables the remarkably high selectivity and stability even in
harsh conditions. The results obtained in this study provide not
only a highly efficient catalytic system for alkane dehydrogenation
but also significant insights for material design to isolate and
stabilize active metals.
Methods
Materials. SiO2 (CARiACT G6, Fuji Silysia, SBET = 673 m2 g1), Al2O3 (prepared
by the calcination of boehmite [γ-AlOOH, supplied by SASOL chemicals] at 900 C
for 3 h, γ-phase), CeO2 (JRC-CEO-2, SBET = 123.1 m2 g1), ZrO2 (JRC-ZRO-6,
SBET = 279.3 m2 g1), and TiO2 (P-25, anatase). MgAl2O4 support was prepared by
a co-precipitation method using urea as a precipitating agent. The precursors and
urea were precisely weighted and dissolved together in deionized water so that
urea/precursors atomic ratio was 20. Mixed aqueous solution of Mg(NO3)3·6H2O,
Al(NO3)3·9H2O and urea was stirred overnight at 90 C. After the precipitation, the
solution was washed with water five times and dried overnight in oven at 90 C,
followed by calcination at 800 C in the dry air for 5 h. CeZrO2 and CaZrO3 were
prepared in a same co-precipitation method used to prepare MgAl2O4. Ce
(NO3)3·6H2O, Zr(NO3)2O·2H2O, and Ca(NO3)2·4H2O were used as precursors.
Catalyst preparation. (1) Pt-based bimetallic catalysts were prepared by the pore-
filling co-impregnation method using SiO2 as the support (Pt3M/SiO2, and PtM/
SiO2, where M = Ga, In, Sn, and Pb; Pt: 3 wt%). Ga(NO3)3·nH2O (n = 79), SnCl2,
Pb(NO3)2 were used as second metal precursors. The ratio of precursors was fixed
at the desired ratio. Mixed aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)2(NO2)2 and second metal
was added dropwise to ground dried SiO2 so that the solutions just filled the pores
of the SiO2. The mixture was kept in a sealed round-bottom flask overnight at
room temperature, followed by quick freezing with liquid nitrogen, freeze-drying in
vacuum at 5 C. The resulting powder was further dried in an oven at 90 C
overnight, calcined in dry air at 400 C for 1 h, and finally reduced by H2 (0.1 MPa,
50 mL min1) at 700 C for 1 h. The catalysts except Pt/SiO2 were further annealed
at 400 C for 2 h under flowing H2 (0.1 MPa, 50 mL min1) to enhance alloying
without further sintering. Ga/SiO2 catalyst with 5wt% loading was prepared using a
similar method (reduction was carried out at 900 C for 1 h). (2) The corre-
sponding silica-supported trimetallic catalysts were also prepared using a similar
method for PtGa/SiO2 [PtGaPb/SiO2, where Pt/Pb = 5, 2.5, 2, and 1.5; PtGa-M/
SiO2, where M = In and Sn, Pt/M = 2; Pt: 3 wt%]. In(NO3)3·8.8H2O (determined
by ICP-AES), SnCl2, and Pb(NO3)2·6H2O were used as third metal precursors. (3)
A series of PtGa bimetallic catalysts supported on various oxides (PtGa/X, where
X = γ-Al2O3, MgAl2O4, CeO2, CeZrO2, ZrO2, CaZrO3, and TiO2; Pt/Ga = 1; Pt:
3 wt%) was prepared by the conventional impregnation method. To prepare the
precursor solution, Pt(NH3)2(NO3)2 and Ga(NO3)3·nH2O (n = 79) were dissolved
in an excess amount of water (ca. 25 mL of ion exchanged water per g of support).
The oxide support was added to a vigorously stirred aqueous solution of the metal
precursors and kept with stirring at 90 C for 3 h. The mixture was dried using a
rotary evaporator at 50 C and further dried overnight in an oven at 90 C. The
resulting powder was treated in a similar manner for the SiO2-supported alloy
catalysts as mentioned above.
Catalytic reaction. PDH was carried out in a vertical, quartz fixed-bed reactor with
6 mm of internal diameter under an atmospheric pressure. Generally, 15 mg of
catalysts diluted with quartz sand (total: 1.5 g) were charged in the reactor. For
the experiments in Fig. 4, the catalyst amount was adjusted so that the number of
exposed Pt was identical (4.5 μmol): PtGa (9.0 mg), PtGaPb (15 mg), Pt3Sn
(3.7 mg). Prior to the catalytic test, the catalyst was prereduced under flowing H2 at
650 C and held at 650 C for 0.5 h. After the pretreatment, the temperature was
kept at 650 C or decreased to 600 C, followed by feeding reactant gas mixture;
C3H8:H2:He = 3.9:5:40, a total of 48.9 mL min1 (WHSV = 30.7 h1). The result-
ing product gas was analyzed by online thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas
chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A with a column of Unipak S, GL Science)
equipped downstream. For all the catalysts, C3H8, C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 were
detected as reaction products. The C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity, C3H8 yield,
and material balance were defined by Eqs. (1)(4), respectively. Material balance
typically ranged between 95% and 105% for all the reactions.

Characterization. XRD patterns of the Pt-based catalysts were obtained using a
MiniFlex 700+D/teX Ultra (X-ray source: Cu Kα radiation). HAADF-STEM
analysis was performed by an FEI Titan G2 or a JEOL JEM-ARM200 M micro-
scope with an EDX detector. The volume averaged particle size in a TEM image
(dTEM) was obtained by the following equation:

where ni and di indicate the number of particles (having the size of di) and the
particle diameter, respectively.
Pt dispersion in the catalysts (percentage of exposed Pt to the total amount of
Pt) was measured by chemisorption of CO at room temperature. Prior to
chemisorption, the catalyst (50 mg) was treated by 5% H2/Ar (40 mL min1) at
300 C for 0.5 h, followed by cooling to room temperature with an He purge
(40 mL min1) to remove chemisorbed hydrogen. We introduced a pulse of 10%
CO/He into the reactor and quantified the CO passed through the catalyst bed
using a TCD detector. This pulse measurement was repeated until no more CO was
adsorbed. We estimated the amount of chemisorbed CO assuming a
1:1 stoichiometry for CO chemisorption on a surface Pt atom.
XPS study was conducted using a JEOL JPS-9010MC spectrometer (X-ray
source: Mg-Kα radiation). The catalysts were treated by flowing H2 at 650 C for
0.5 h in a quartz reactor, followed by transferring into the spectrometer in air. The
surface of the catalyst was sputtered by Ar+ (voltage: 400 V, rate: 20%, time: 1 s, at
each cycle) for the depth analysis. Calibration of the binding energy was performed
with the Si 2p emission of the SiO2 support (103.9 eV).

FT-IR spectra of adsorbed CO were obtained with a JASCO FTIR-4100
spectrometer with a TGS detector in the transmission mode (resolution 4 cm1)
under a dynamic condition. Prior to CO chemisorption, 50 mg of the catalyst was
pressed into a pellet (diameter of 20 mm) and placed in a quartz cell equipped with
CaF2 windows and a Dewar vessel, followed by reduction under a flowing H2 at
550 C for 1 h. The reduced sample was then kept in vacuum at 550 C for 1 h, then
the cell was cooled to ca 196 C by liquid nitrogen. The sample was exposed to a
pulse of low-pressure CO, and then evacuated in vacuum to remove the gaseous
CO and concentrated CO on the catalyst. This CO exposure was repeated several
times until the CO saturation coverage.
TPO experiment was performed to quantify the amount of coke deposited on
the spent catalysts after 20 h of PDH at 600 C (15 mg of the catalyst without quartz
sand). The spent catalyst (10 mg) placed in a quartz tube reactor was treated under
flowing He (40 mL min1) at 150 C for 30 min, followed by cooling to room
temperature. Then, the catalyst bed temperature was increased (25900 C,
ramping rate: 5 C min1) under flowing O2/He (50%, 40 mL min1). The amount
of CO2 in the outlet gas was quantified by an online mass spectrometer.
XAFS spectra of the prepared catalysts were collected at the BL01B1 beamline of
SPring-8, Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI) using an Si(111)
double-crystal as a monochromator. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was
pelletized (ca. 150 mg with a diameter of 10 mm) and pretreated by H2 at 650 C
for 0.5 h in a quartz tube. After the pretreatment, the quartz tube containing the
reduced pellet was sealed and transferred into an Ar grove box (O2: <0.1 ppm)
without exposing to air. The pellet was sealed in a plastic film bag (Barrier Nylon)
together with an oxygen absorber (ISO A500-HS: Fe powder). The Pt LIII- and Ga
K-edges XAFS spectra were recorded in a transmission mode at room temperature.
Athena and Artemis software ver. 0.9.25 implemented in the Demeter package35
was used for the analysis of the obtained XAFS spectra. Fourier-transform of the Pt
LIII-edge EXAFS oscillation was obtained in the k range of 316 Å1. The back
Fourier-transform obtained in the R range of 1.53.5 Å was used for curve-fitting.
FEFF8 was used for the calculation of the back-scattering amplitude and phase shift
functions36. We defined the R-factor (R2) for curve-fitting as follows:

Computational details. DFT calculations were performed by using the CASTEP
code37. We used Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotentials38 and the revised
version of PerdewBurkeErnzerhof exchange-correlation functional39,40 based
on the generalized gradient approximation. A cut-off energy of 370 eV was used for
the plane-wave basis set. A k-point mesh with a spacing of 0.04 Å1 generated by
the MonkhorstPack scheme41 was used to sample the Brillouin zone. In this
study, the PtGa:A(111) and Pt3Sn(111) planes were considered as the standard
active surfaces for PDH. The supercell structure was constructed using a (2 × 2)
unit cell slab with six atomic layers and a vacuum spacing of 15 Å. We performed
geometry optimizations on the supercell structures using a Fermi smearing of
0.1 eV, the OBS method for dispersion correlations, and the following convergence
criteria: (1) self-consistent field tolerance: 1.0 × 106 eV per atom; (2) energy tol-
erance: 1.0 × 105 eV per atom; (3) maximum force tolerance of 0.05 eV Å1, and
(4) maximum displacement tolerance: 1.0 × 103 Å. Transition state search was
carried out based on the complete linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchro-
nous transit method42,43 with the tolerance for all root-mean-square forces on an
atom of 0.10 eV Å1.
