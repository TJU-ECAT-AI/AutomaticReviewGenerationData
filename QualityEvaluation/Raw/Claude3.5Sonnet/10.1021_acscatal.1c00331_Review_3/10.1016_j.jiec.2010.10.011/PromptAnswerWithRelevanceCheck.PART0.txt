<quotes>

[1] "Catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation are based on Pt/g-Al2O3 because of its low activity for hydrogenolysis; however, this catalyst is susceptible to deactivation by coke deposits occurring under high temperature reaction conditions [4,5]."

[2] "Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

[3] "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information on how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that coke deposits can lead to catalyst deactivation by poisoning active sites or blocking pores, which suggests that pore structure plays an important role. The paper reports measuring textural properties like surface area, pore volume and pore size using N2 sorption, indicating these are relevant factors. To fully answer this question, additional research would be needed on how variations in pore characteristics specifically affect coke formation and PDH catalyst performance. Optimizing these pore structure parameters could potentially improve catalyst stability and effectiveness.

这篇文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的具体特征如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的详细信息。然而,它确实提到焦炭沉积可以通过毒化活性位点或阻塞孔道来导致催化剂失活,这表明孔结构起着重要作用。文章报道使用N2吸附测量了表面积、孔体积和孔径等织构性质,表明这些是相关因素。要全面回答这个问题,还需要对孔特征的变化如何具体影响焦炭形成和PDH催化剂性能进行额外研究。优化这些孔结构参数可能有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和有效性。

[1] "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

[2] "Catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, in general, increase in the following order: 1% Pt < 1% Pt0.29% Sn < 1% Pt0.53% Sn < 1% Pt1.67% Sn. The best coke tolerance is found with the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst which had the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The text only mentions that textural properties were measured by N2-sorption, but does not discuss their impact. The study focuses more on the effects of adding tin to platinum catalysts, showing that increased tin content improved catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and coke tolerance. To fully answer this question, additional research specifically examining pore structure effects would be needed.

这篇文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的具体特征如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的详细信息。文中只提到通过N2吸附法测量了织构性质，但没有讨论它们的影响。该研究更多地关注向铂催化剂中添加锡的效果，表明增加锡含量可以提高催化活性、丙烯选择性和抗焦性。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行专门研究孔结构效应的额外研究。

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The study only mentions that mesoporous alumina was used as the catalyst support, and textural properties like surface area, pore volume, and pore size were measured. However, it does not explore in detail how these properties affect coke formation or catalyst performance. The implications for designing optimal catalysts based on pore structure characteristics are not discussed. More research would be needed to establish clear relationships between pore structure features and PDH catalyst effectiveness.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳能力和整体催化剂性能的问题。该研究仅提到使用了介孔氧化铝作为催化剂载体,并测量了比表面积、孔体积和孔径等结构特性。然而,它并没有详细探讨这些特性如何影响积碳形成或催化剂性能。文献也没有讨论基于孔结构特征设计最优催化剂的意义。需要进行更多研究才能建立孔结构特征与PDH催化剂有效性之间的明确关系。

The literature does not provide detailed information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study mainly focuses on the effects of adding tin to platinum catalysts rather than examining different pore structures.

However, the document does mention that textural properties like surface area, pore volume, and pore size were measured using N2-sorption techniques. The pore size distribution was calculated using the BJH model. This suggests that these properties were considered important for catalyst performance, though their specific impacts on coke formation and catalyst effectiveness are not elaborated upon in the given text.

The study found that increasing tin content in PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts improved catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and coke tolerance. The 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst showed the best performance with the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content. This indicates that catalyst composition plays a crucial role in determining coke formation and overall catalyst performance, but the specific relationships to pore structure characteristics are not discussed in detail.

To fully answer this question and provide insights on optimal catalyst design, further research would be needed to specifically investigate the relationships between various pore structure characteristics and their impacts on coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

该文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能的详细信息。该研究主要集中在向铂催化剂中添加锡的效果上，而不是研究不同的孔结构。

然而，文档确实提到了使用N2吸附技术测量了表面积、孔体积和孔径等纹理特性。孔径分布是使用BJH模型计算的。这表明这些特性被认为对催化剂性能很重要，尽管在给定的文本中没有详细说明它们对积碳形成和催化剂有效性的具体影响。

研究发现，增加PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中的锡含量可以提高催化活性、丙烯选择性和抗积碳能力。1% Pt1.67% Sn催化剂表现最佳，具有最慢的失活速率和最低的积碳含量。这表明催化剂组成在决定积碳形成和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用，但没有详细讨论与孔结构特征的具体关系。

要全面回答这个问题并为最佳催化剂设计提供见解，需要进行进一步的研究，专门调查各种孔结构特征与它们对PDH反应中积碳形成和催化剂性能的影响之间的关系。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The text only mentions basic textural properties like surface area, pore volume, and pore size measured by N2-sorption, without discussing their specific effects on coke formation or catalyst performance. 

The document does note that coke can decrease catalytic activity by poisoning active sites or blocking pores, limiting reactant access. However, it does not elaborate on how different pore characteristics affect these processes.

To fully answer this question would require additional information beyond what is provided in this literature. Optimizing catalyst design would likely involve balancing pore characteristics to maximize active site accessibility while minimizing coke formation and accumulation, but the specific relationships are not detailed here.

该文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的详细信息。文本仅提到了通过N2吸附测量的基本结构特性，如比表面积、孔容和孔径，但没有讨论它们对焦炭形成或催化剂性能的具体影响。

文档确实指出，焦炭可以通过毒化活性位点或阻塞孔道来降低催化活性，从而限制反应物的接触。然而，它并没有详细说明不同的孔特征如何影响这些过程。

要全面回答这个问题，需要超出本文献所提供的额外信息。优化催化剂设计可能涉及平衡孔特征，以最大化活性位点的可及性，同时最小化焦炭的形成和积累，但这里没有详细说明具体的关系。
