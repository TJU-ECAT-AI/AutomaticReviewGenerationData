[1] "Mesoporous alumina was synthesized by a solgel method."

[2] "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

[3] "From the desorption branch, the pore size distribution was calculated by using the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) model."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The study only mentions that mesoporous alumina was used as the catalyst support, and textural properties like surface area, pore volume, and pore size were measured. However, it does not explore in detail how these properties affect coke formation or catalyst performance. The implications for designing optimal catalysts based on pore structure characteristics are not discussed. More research would be needed to establish clear relationships between pore structure features and PDH catalyst effectiveness.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳能力和整体催化剂性能的问题。该研究仅提到使用了介孔氧化铝作为催化剂载体,并测量了比表面积、孔体积和孔径等结构特性。然而,它并没有详细探讨这些特性如何影响积碳形成或催化剂性能。文献也没有讨论基于孔结构特征设计最优催化剂的意义。需要进行更多研究才能建立孔结构特征与PDH催化剂有效性之间的明确关系。
