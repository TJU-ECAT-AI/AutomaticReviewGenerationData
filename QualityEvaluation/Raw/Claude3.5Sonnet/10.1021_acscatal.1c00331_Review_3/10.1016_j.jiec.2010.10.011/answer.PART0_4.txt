[1] "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

[2] "Table 1
Textural properties of the reduced catalysts measured by N2-sorption.
Catalyst Surface area (m2/g) Pore volume (ml/g) Pore size (BJH) (nm)"

[3] "Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The text only mentions basic textural properties like surface area, pore volume, and pore size measured by N2-sorption, without discussing their specific effects on coke formation or catalyst performance. 

The document does note that coke can decrease catalytic activity by poisoning active sites or blocking pores, limiting reactant access. However, it does not elaborate on how different pore characteristics affect these processes.

To fully answer this question would require additional information beyond what is provided in this literature. Optimizing catalyst design would likely involve balancing pore characteristics to maximize active site accessibility while minimizing coke formation and accumulation, but the specific relationships are not detailed here.

该文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能的详细信息。文本仅提到了通过N2吸附测量的基本结构特性，如比表面积、孔容和孔径，但没有讨论它们对焦炭形成或催化剂性能的具体影响。

文档确实指出，焦炭可以通过毒化活性位点或阻塞孔道来降低催化活性，从而限制反应物的接触。然而，它并没有详细说明不同的孔特征如何影响这些过程。

要全面回答这个问题，需要超出本文献所提供的额外信息。优化催化剂设计可能涉及平衡孔特征，以最大化活性位点的可及性，同时最小化焦炭的形成和积累，但这里没有详细说明具体的关系。
