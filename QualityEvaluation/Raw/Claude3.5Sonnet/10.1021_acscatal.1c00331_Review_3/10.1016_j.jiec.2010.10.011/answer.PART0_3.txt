[1] "Catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, in general, increase in the following order: 1% Pt < 1% Pt0.29% Sn < 1% Pt0.53% Sn < 1% Pt1.67% Sn. The best coke tolerance is found with the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst which had the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content."

[2] "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

[3] "From the desorption branch, the pore size distribution was calculated by using the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) model."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study mainly focuses on the effects of adding tin to platinum catalysts rather than examining different pore structures.

However, the document does mention that textural properties like surface area, pore volume, and pore size were measured using N2-sorption techniques. The pore size distribution was calculated using the BJH model. This suggests that these properties were considered important for catalyst performance, though their specific impacts on coke formation and catalyst effectiveness are not elaborated upon in the given text.

The study found that increasing tin content in PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts improved catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and coke tolerance. The 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst showed the best performance with the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content. This indicates that catalyst composition plays a crucial role in determining coke formation and overall catalyst performance, but the specific relationships to pore structure characteristics are not discussed in detail.

To fully answer this question and provide insights on optimal catalyst design, further research would be needed to specifically investigate the relationships between various pore structure characteristics and their impacts on coke formation and catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

该文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的各种特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能的详细信息。该研究主要集中在向铂催化剂中添加锡的效果上，而不是研究不同的孔结构。

然而，文档确实提到了使用N2吸附技术测量了表面积、孔体积和孔径等纹理特性。孔径分布是使用BJH模型计算的。这表明这些特性被认为对催化剂性能很重要，尽管在给定的文本中没有详细说明它们对积碳形成和催化剂有效性的具体影响。

研究发现，增加PtSn/Al2O3催化剂中的锡含量可以提高催化活性、丙烯选择性和抗积碳能力。1% Pt1.67% Sn催化剂表现最佳，具有最慢的失活速率和最低的积碳含量。这表明催化剂组成在决定积碳形成和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用，但没有详细讨论与孔结构特征的具体关系。

要全面回答这个问题并为最佳催化剂设计提供见解，需要进行进一步的研究，专门调查各种孔结构特征与它们对PDH反应中积碳形成和催化剂性能的影响之间的关系。
