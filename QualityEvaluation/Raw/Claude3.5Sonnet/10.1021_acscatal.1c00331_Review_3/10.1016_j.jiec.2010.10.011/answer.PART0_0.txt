[1] "Catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation are based on Pt/g-Al2O3 because of its low activity for hydrogenolysis; however, this catalyst is susceptible to deactivation by coke deposits occurring under high temperature reaction conditions [4,5]."

[2] "Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

[3] "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention that coke deposits can lead to catalyst deactivation by poisoning active sites or blocking pores, which suggests that pore structure plays an important role. The paper reports measuring textural properties like surface area, pore volume and pore size using N2 sorption, indicating these are relevant factors. To fully answer this question, additional research would be needed on how variations in pore characteristics specifically affect coke formation and PDH catalyst performance. Optimizing these pore structure parameters could potentially improve catalyst stability and effectiveness.

这篇文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的具体特征如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的详细信息。然而,它确实提到焦炭沉积可以通过毒化活性位点或阻塞孔道来导致催化剂失活,这表明孔结构起着重要作用。文章报道使用N2吸附测量了表面积、孔体积和孔径等织构性质,表明这些是相关因素。要全面回答这个问题,还需要对孔特征的变化如何具体影响焦炭形成和PDH催化剂性能进行额外研究。优化这些孔结构参数可能有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和有效性。
