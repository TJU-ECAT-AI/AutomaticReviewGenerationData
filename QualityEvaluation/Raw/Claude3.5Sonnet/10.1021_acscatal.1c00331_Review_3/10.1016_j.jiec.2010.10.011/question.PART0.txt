1. Introduction
Most of the propylene consumed in the petrochemical industry
is produced with ethylene in a naphtha cracking center. As the
demand for propylene is growing faster than ethylene demand, the
net result is a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking
relative to demand. Hence, a shortfall is made-up by on-purpose
propylene from propane dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogena-
tion is an endothermic reaction and conversion is limited by
thermodynamics. Higher conversion rates will require either
higher temperatures or lower pressures [1]; commercially viable
conversion requires reaction temperatures above 500 8C [2]. At
high temperatures, parasitic reactions such as oligomerization to
heavier compounds, cracking to lighter hydrocarbons, skeletal
isomerization, aromatization, alkylation of the formed aromatic
rings, and formation of carbonaceous deposits lead to rapid loss of
activity and lower yields [3].
Catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation are based on Pt/g-
Al2O3 because of its low activity for hydrogenolysis; however, this
catalyst is susceptible to deactivation by coke deposits occurring
under high temperature reaction conditions [4,5]. To improve the
coke tolerance of the supported platinum catalyst, many reaction
modifications have been explored. Hydrogen was added into the
propane feedstock to suppress the tendency of over-dehydroge-
nation [6]. Supported Pt catalysts were modified by adding a
second metal (Sn, Pb, Zn, Ga) [710] and/or alkali metal (Li, K, Na)
[11]. Some rare earth metals (La, Ce) were also used to promote the
supports (Al2O3, SiO2) by enhancing their thermal stability and
electronic effects [12]. Although Sn is one of the most efficient
promoters, deactivation due to coke formation is not completely
eliminated, and the catalysts still have a short lifetime and require
regeneration to restore activity. Another approach has been the use
of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymeri-
zation reactions compared with acidic supports [1315].
Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased
catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites
or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial
or complete blockage of pores by coke. Both deactivation modes
can occur simultaneously, although one of the two mechanisms is
usually predominant [16]. To regenerate the catalysts, the coke is
removed through oxidation at high temperatures that result in
metal sintering or support degradation. Therefore, understanding
the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in
improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regener-
ation.
As a promoter, Sn has been suggested to modify the electronic
and geometric properties of Pt [17]; however, the role of Sn in Pt
Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, a subject of debate for many years, remains
elusive [18,19]. For example, an increase in coke content is usually
obtained when Sn is added into a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [2022]. In

Pt and PtSn/alumina catalysts were prepared by either an incipient wetness impregnation or co-
impregnation method, and their deactivation behavior, coke structure and coke location in propane
dehydrogenation were investigated by XRD, XPS, TPO and reaction tests. The XRD and XPS
measurements confirmed that coke structure over all spent catalysts was pregraphite-like carbon,
which presents at 2u = 258 in XRD patterns and binding energy = 283.9 eV in XPS spectra. In the TPO
results, along with Sn contents, oxidation peak of coke was shifted to a higher temperature, which can be
interpreted that coke formed during the reaction was mainly located on the support in the case of PtSn/
alumina because coke generated on metal surfaces was readily transferred to the support in the presence
of Sn. This would be responsible for high tolerance of PtSn/Al2O3 to catalyst deactivation.

contrast, a decrease in coke content was reported on bimetallic Pt
Sn/Al2O3 compared to its counterpart Pt/Al2O3 [2325]. In this
work, we tried to investigate the influence of Sn addition on the
structure and location of coke formed in propane dehydrogenation
over PtAl2O3 catalysts. Propane dehydrogenation was performed
in a fixed-bed reactor to monitor the deactivation behavior of the
catalysts. The coke structure was identified using XRD and XPS; the
coke location was revealed by TPO.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Mesoporous alumina was synthesized by a solgel method.
Typically,
6.0 g
of
cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide
(CTAB,
Aldrich) was added to a mixture containing 525 ml of deionized
water and 225 ml of ethanol (Aldrich) under vigorous stirring at
60 8C for 20 min. Then, 10 ml of ammonium hydroxide was added
to the solution, and 30 g of aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (Aldrich)
was added dropwise while stirring. The resulting mixture was held
at 60 8C and continued stirring for 3 h. After filtration, the product
was washed with ethanol and dried in air at 25 8C for 12 h. The
product was calcined in an air flow by heating from room
temperature to 550 8C at a rate of 2 8C/min and holding at 550 8C
for 6.0 h. More information on the procedure for synthesis of
mesoporous alumina can be found in the literature [26].
Pt loadings on alumina were prepared using the incipient
wetness impregnation technique. Bimetallic catalysts (1% Pt0.29%
Sn, 1% Pt0.53% Sn, 1% Pt1.67% Sn) were prepared by a co-
impregnation technique. Metal loading percentage is the weight
percentage of metal loaded to catalysts per total catalyst. Precursor
(H2PtCl66H2O and/or SnCl2) was dissolved in a solution of 1 M HCl.
Then, one aliquot of 200 ml of precursor was evenly dispersed over
calcined alumina, and this procedure was repeated until the ratio
of liquid to support was 1 ml/g. Catalysts were dried at room
temperature for 24 h in a vacuum hood before drying at 100 8C for
12 h in an oven. Calcination was performed at 450 8C for 6 h from
room temperature to 450 8C with a ramp of 1 8C/min.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Coke on spent catalysts was measured by a thermogravimetric
analyzer (TA Instruments Q50). Approximately 10.0 mg of spent
catalyst was charged into the sample pan, and then was heated to
700 8C at a rate of 40 8C/min in a flow of air. The coke content, based
on a dried sample of each catalyst, was calculated after subtracting
the water content.
Isotherm and pore size distribution of the reduced catalysts
were characterized by the nitrogen sorption technique (Micro-
meritics ASAP 2020). The samples were degassed before analyzing
under vacuum at 300 8C for 4 h and measured at 196.15 8C on an
automatic analyzer. From the desorption branch, the pore size
distribution was calculated by using the BarrettJoynerHalenda
(BJH) model. Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-
sorption are listed in Table 1.
Coke structure on spent catalysts was characterized by the XRD
technique. The diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/
MAX-2200 powder X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Ka radiation
source (l = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray tube was operated at 35 kV,
20 mA, and the 2u angle was scanned from 10 to 1008 (step wise
0.028) at a speed of 28/min.
An XPS study of fresh and spent catalysts was carried out on a
Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB-250 instrument with an excitation
source of AlKa radiation. Besides a scan range from 0 to 1200 eV
binding energy for identification of all detectable elements,
detailed scans for chemical state identification and quantification
were also obtained. Because the most intense line, the Pt 4f7/2
doublet, completely overlapped with the Al 2p line from the Al2O3
support, the Pt 4d5/2 line was used for identification of the chemical
state. The binding energy of the Al 2s line from Al2O3 at 119.0 eV
was used as an internal reference for calibration. To determine the
binding energy, the peaks were fitted with Gaussian curves after a
background correction. The assignment of peaks was interpreted
based on the NIST X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Data base,
Version 3.5 [27].
2.3. Catalytic deactivation test
Dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a quartz fixed-bed
reactor flow system at atmospheric pressure. For all experiments,
the catalyst (100 mg) was previously reduced with a flow (50 ml/
min) of pure H2 at 600 8C for 2 h and purged to remove H2 gas
remaining in the reactor for 10 min with a flow (100 ml/min) of N2.
Then the reaction mixture consisting of N2 (100 ml/min) and C3H8
(30 ml/min) was fed into the reactor at 600 8C. The flow rate of each
gas was controlled by a mass-flow-controller that had been
previously calibrated. Beginning 1 min from the start of the
reaction, the product of the reaction was sampled at time intervals
and analyzed by gas chromatography (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC).
A flame ionization detector and a 30 m  0.53 mm HP-PLOT Al2O3
KCl capillary column were used to detect and separate each
component in the product.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Deactivation rate and coke content
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was performed at
600 8C and atmospheric pressure for 160 min on stream. The
influence of platinum loading and a second metal on propane
conversion and propylene selectivity is shown in Fig. 1. The
amount of coke deposited on each catalyst was quantified by TGA
analysis as shown in Table 2.
To compare the deactivation rate among the catalysts, we took
the mathematical model from the previous report that gave the
following equation [28]:
lg xt
x0
 lg A  n lg t
where xt is the conversion of propane in the moment t, x0 is the
initial conversion, and the ratio xt/x0 is the relative activity. The
deactivation rate of the catalyst can be calculated by utilizing the
above equation. A higher absolute value of n is a faster catalyst
deactivation rate. After linear regression, the values for n were
derived from the slopes of fitting curves as summarized in Table 2.

Catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, in general, increase
in the following order: 1% Pt < 1% Pt0.29% Sn < 1% Pt0.53%
Sn < 1% Pt1.67% Sn. The best coke tolerance is found with the 1%
Pt1.67% Sn catalyst which had the slowest deactivation rate and
lowest coke content.
On the 1% Pt catalyst, propane conversion decreases dramati-
cally and propylene selectivity increases sharply after a few
minutes on stream. This observation indicates that coke deposition
leads to deactivation and coke on the surface of the catalyst acts as
a promoter that poisons the sites responsible for side reactions.
When tin was added into platinum supported on alumina catalyst,
propane conversion as well as propylene selectivity increased. This
result is in agreement with numerous previous studies that
suggest tin promotes platinum-supported catalysts by increasing
platinum dispersion that leads to higher conversion [2931]. An
improvement in platinum dispersion is also found when other
second metals, such as cerium or zinc, are added into the platinum-
supported catalyst [8].
In the case of 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst, the valent states of tin and
its influence on the electronic properties of Pt were identified by
XPS and are shown in Fig. 2. Two peaks in Fig. 2a with binding
energies of Sn (3d5/2) at 484.3 and 486.1 eV correspond to Sn(0)
(zero-valent) and Sn(II, IV) (mixture of di-valent and tetra-valent),
respectively. The binding energies of Pt (4d5/2) in Fig. 2b without
and

are
located
at
314.2
and

respectively. Our results agree with previous XPS measurements

that indicate a fraction of tin in the zero-valent state and probable
formation of intermetallic species with Pt in the reduced PtSn/
Al2O3 catalyst [32,33].
High coordination sites on Pt particles (terraces, steps) are
active sites for CH and HH bond breaking while low coordination
sites (kinks, edges) are highly active sites for CC bond scission
[34,35]. It has been suggested that tin is selectively distributed at
the low coordination sites on rhodium [36] and nickel surfaces
[37]. Therefore, we expect the role of tin on the platinum surface to
be similar to that on rhodium or nickel surfaces. In a previous
study, tin was found at the more energetic sites on the surface of
platinum particles supported on hydrotalcite as observed by in situ
CO-FTIR [38]. Because tin inhibits the low coordination sites on
platinum particles which are responsible for side reactions
producing coke precursors, the addition of tin into the platinum
catalyst reduces the coke content and deactivation rate on the
bimetallic PtSn catalyst.
3.2. Coke structure
Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of fresh and spent catalysts of 1%
Pt and 1% Pt1.67% Sn. Four patterns from (a) to (d) display three
distinct peaks at 2u = 38, 46, and 678, which agree with the
standard for g-Al2O3 (JCPDS No. 29-1486). These peaks have
obviously strong intensities indicating that g-Al2O3 has a good
crystallinity. The platinum, tin, and intermetallic phases are not
detected in the fresh and spent catalysts. This indicates either that
Pt, Sn, and intermetallic species are well dispersed on the g-Al2O3
after reduction and are not sintered after reaction or that the small
crystallite size is below the limit of XRD detection. The similarity of
the gamma phase of Al2O3 in the XRD patterns between fresh and
spent catalysts indicates that the structure of the alumina support
did not change after the reaction.
One characteristic peak in the XRD, the so-called peak of coke,
located at 2u = 258 (d = 3.56 A
 ) from 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt1.67%
Sn-spent catalysts, is the main difference between the patterns of
the fresh and spent catalysts. For all spent catalysts, the spacing of
the line at 2u = 258 (d = 3.56 A
 ) is greater than the line correspond-
ing to graphite carbon (d(0 0 2) = 3.35 A
 ). This kind of coke can be
considered to be a carbon type called pregraphite-like carbon.
This characterization shows that the coke on Pt and PtSn/Al2O3
has a certain degree of organization which was also observed in a
previous study of the hydrocarbon reforming process over a Pt-
supported alumina catalyst [39].
More information on the nature of the coke species, the C 1s
spectra from XPS over 1% Pt-fresh and 1% Pt-spent catalysts and 1%
Pt1.67% Sn-fresh and 1% Pt1.67% Sn-spent catalysts are shown in
Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. The binding energy and percent area of
each peak for fresh and spent catalysts are listed in Table 3.
On 1% Pt-fresh and 1% Pt1.67% Sn-fresh catalyst, the C 1s
spectrum is composed of five peaks that correspond to the signals
from dehydrogenated carbon species (DHC) (282.4 eV) [40],

(285.7 eV), oxidized carbon in ketone groups C5
5O (287.2
eV), and oxidized carbon in carboxyl groups OC5
5O (289.2 eV)
[41]. After the reaction, one new peak with a binding energy at
283.9 eV appears in the XPS spectra from 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt
1.67% Sn-spent catalysts. The dominant percent area of this peak in
the XPS spectra indicates that the surfaces of the spent catalysts are
almost completely covered by these species.

The binding energy of some transition metallic carbides such as
Fe3C, Mo2C, WC, and Cr7C3 has a value in the range of 283.1
283.9 eV [27]. Consequently, it can be deduced that the binding
energy at 283.9 eV on 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt1.67% Sn-spent
catalysts may derive from platinum carbide. However, the
solubility of carbon in bulk Pt is very low, and solubility requires
the high temperature (1700 8C) and long contact time (12 h)
[42] that exceed reaction temperature in this study. We suggest
that the C 1s peak at 283.9 eV on 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt1.67% Sn-
spent catalysts does not originate from platinum carbide as a small
amount of carbide compound with Sn (zero-valent) would
probably also be formed. Consequently, the 283.9 eV band is an
unusual binding energy of coke which probably comes from the
carbon structure known as pregraphite-like carbon as was
previously mentioned in the XRD characterization. This lower
grade of graphite order has a certain degree of organization as
shown in the XRD patterns. The pregraphite-like carbon was also
observed in the C 1s XPS spectra with a binding energy at 283.2 eV
during the conversion of methane to benzene over a Mo/H-ZSM-5
catalyst [43]. From the XRD and XPS analyses, we believe that the
coke on the PtSn/Al2O3 has the same structure as on the Pt/Al2O3
catalyst; consequently, the addition of Sn has no influence on coke
structure.
3.3. Coke location
The TGA technique allows a determination of the coke location
on supported metal catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 6.
Two successive peaks are observed in the TGA profile of 1% Pt-
spent catalysts after deactivation for 160 min on stream. The TGA
profile was fitted using Gaussian curves to determine the
temperature of the first and second oxidation peaks (at the
shoulder). At least two peaks are observed in the TPO profile of the
four spent catalysts and the portion of the peaks is dependent on Sn
contents; the oxidation temperatures of the main peaks are shifted
from 465 to 513 8C.
Generally, in paraffin dehydrogenation process at high temper-
ature, the TPO profile of spent Pt/Al2O3 catalyst consists of two
peaks corresponding to two locations of coke. The first (lower
temperature) and second peaks (higher temperature) are assigned
to coke located on the metal and on the support, respectively. The
electronic properties of the Pt surface are changed by the addition

of tin, which decreases the strength of the bond between the
adsorbed hydrocarbon species and the platinum surface. This
electronic effect leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the
support and therefore to differences in the coke locations between
the catalysts [44].
In our study, it is observed that the peak positions of coke
oxidation in TPO profiles are systematically shifted to higher
temperatures along with Sn contents. Accordingly, the presence of
Sn induces the shift of coke oxidation temperature to higher
because Sn addition accelerates the transfer of coke to the support.
Our observation is very similar to the data reported by Liwu et al.
[44] that investigated dynamic process of carbon deposition on Pt
and PtSn supported alumina catalysts used for dehydrogenation
of n-butane with H2 adding in the feedstock. These results indicate
that the fraction of coke on Pt metallic phase is suppressed
significantly after Sn is added to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The spillover
of coke from Pt metallic phase to the support plays an important
role in catalytic stability as the encapsulation of Pt metallic phase
by coke diminishes by Sn addition and the higher portion of active
sites on Pt metallic phase in the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst keep alive
during the reaction [45].
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt
allowing better coke tolerance and a catalytic performance
comparable to monometallic catalysts. XRD and XPS analyses
reveal that coke from all spent catalysts had the same pregraphite-
like carbon structure and was not affected by Sn addition. Tin
addition leads to transfer of coke from the metal to the support,
with the ratio of coke fraction on the metal to support deceasing
significantly. The lowest coke content on the 1% Pt1.67% Sn
catalyst is due to inhibition of Sn on low coordination sites on the
Pt surface.
