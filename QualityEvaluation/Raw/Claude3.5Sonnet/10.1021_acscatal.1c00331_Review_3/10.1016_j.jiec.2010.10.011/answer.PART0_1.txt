[1] "Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1."

[2] "Catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, in general, increase in the following order: 1% Pt < 1% Pt0.29% Sn < 1% Pt0.53% Sn < 1% Pt1.67% Sn. The best coke tolerance is found with the 1% Pt1.67% Sn catalyst which had the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how specific characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The text only mentions that textural properties were measured by N2-sorption, but does not discuss their impact. The study focuses more on the effects of adding tin to platinum catalysts, showing that increased tin content improved catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and coke tolerance. To fully answer this question, additional research specifically examining pore structure effects would be needed.

这篇文献没有提供关于催化剂载体孔结构的具体特征如何影响丙烷脱氢反应中焦炭形成和催化剂性能的详细信息。文中只提到通过N2吸附法测量了织构性质，但没有讨论它们的影响。该研究更多地关注向铂催化剂中添加锡的效果，表明增加锡含量可以提高催化活性、丙烯选择性和抗焦性。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行专门研究孔结构效应的额外研究。
