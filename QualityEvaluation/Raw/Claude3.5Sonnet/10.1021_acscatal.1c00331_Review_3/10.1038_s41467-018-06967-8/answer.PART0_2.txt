The literature provided does not contain any information about how catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on the development and performance of Pt/Cu single atom alloy catalysts for PDH, but does not discuss catalyst support pore structures or their effects on coking and catalyst performance. Without relevant information in the given text, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.
