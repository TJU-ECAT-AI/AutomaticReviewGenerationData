<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide any information about the influence of catalyst support pore structures on coke formation, accommodation, or overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text focuses on the development and performance of Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts for PDH, but does not discuss the role of support pore characteristics. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided information.
