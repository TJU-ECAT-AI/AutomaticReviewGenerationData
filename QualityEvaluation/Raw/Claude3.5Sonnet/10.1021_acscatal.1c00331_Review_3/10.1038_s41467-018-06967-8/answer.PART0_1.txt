The given literature does not contain any information about catalyst support pore structures and their influence on coke formation, accommodation, or overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on single-atom alloy catalysts, particularly Pt/Cu single atom alloys, and their performance in PDH reactions. It does not discuss the effects of support pore characteristics on catalyst behavior or coke formation.
