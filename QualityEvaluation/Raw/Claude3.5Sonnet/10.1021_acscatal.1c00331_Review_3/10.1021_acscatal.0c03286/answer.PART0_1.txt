[1] "Compared with commercial alumina, the hierarchical nanoalumina benefited from its highly open structure, and the stable surface property showed a remarkable ability to improve the mass-transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalysts structural stability."

[2] "The surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts with different loadings are 60.368.7 m2/g and 0.310.36 cm3/g, respectively. Following the improvement of Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process."

The literature does not directly address how different characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that hierarchical nanoalumina with a highly open structure improves mass transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalyst structural stability compared to commercial alumina. This suggests that pore structure characteristics like connectivity and hierarchical arrangements can positively impact catalyst performance by enhancing mass transfer and stability.

The study focuses more on the effects of Pt particle size rather than support pore structure. It notes that increasing Pt loading slightly decreased surface area and pore volume, but did not change the overall structural properties of the alumina support. This implies that the support pore structure remained relatively constant across different catalyst samples, allowing the researchers to isolate the effects of Pt particle size on performance.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to specifically investigate how different pore structure characteristics affect coke formation, accommodation, and overall PDH performance. Such studies could provide valuable insights for designing optimal catalyst supports with pore structures that minimize coking and enhance catalyst effectiveness and longevity.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到了具有高度开放结构的分级纳米氧化铝与商业氧化铝相比，能够改善传质、扩散动力学和催化剂结构稳定性。这表明孔结构特征如连通性和分层排列可以通过增强传质和稳定性来积极影响催化剂性能。

该研究更多地关注Pt粒子尺寸的影响，而不是载体孔结构。研究注意到，随着Pt负载量的增加，比表面积和孔体积略有下降，但并未改变氧化铝载体的整体结构特性。这意味着在不同的催化剂样品中，载体孔结构保持相对恒定，使研究人员能够单独研究Pt粒子尺寸对性能的影响。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究，专门调查不同的孔结构特征如何影响积碳形成、容纳和整体PDH性能。这样的研究可以为设计具有最佳孔结构的催化剂载体提供有价值的见解，从而最大程度地减少积碳并提高催化剂的有效性和寿命。
