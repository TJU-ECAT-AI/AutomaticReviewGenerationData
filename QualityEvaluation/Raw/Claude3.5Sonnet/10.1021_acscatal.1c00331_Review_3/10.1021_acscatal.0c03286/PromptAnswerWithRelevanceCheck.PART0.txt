[1] "Compared with commercial alumina, the hierarchical nanoalumina benefited from its highly open structure, and the stable surface property showed a remarkable ability to improve the mass-transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalysts structural stability."

[2] "The surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts with different loadings are 60.368.7 m2/g and 0.310.36 cm3/g, respectively. Following the improvement of Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process."

The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that hierarchical nanoalumina with a highly open structure improves mass transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalyst structural stability compared to commercial alumina. This suggests that pore structure characteristics like connectivity and hierarchical arrangements can positively impact overall catalyst performance by enhancing mass transfer and stability.

The study does not provide specific information on how pore size, uniformity, or other structural features affect coke formation or accommodation. It only notes that increasing Pt loading slightly decreased the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts, but did not change the overall structural properties of the Al2O3 support.

To fully answer this question, additional research would be needed to investigate the direct relationships between various pore structure characteristics and coke formation, accommodation, and catalyst performance in PDH reactions. This could help inform the design of optimal and effective catalysts by elucidating which pore structure features are most beneficial for minimizing coking and maximizing catalyst stability and activity.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到了具有高度开放结构的分层纳米氧化铝与商业氧化铝相比，能够改善传质、扩散动力学和催化剂结构稳定性。这表明孔结构特性，如连通性和分层排列，可以通过增强传质和稳定性来积极影响整体催化剂性能。

该研究没有提供关于孔径大小、均匀性或其他结构特征如何影响积碳形成或容纳的具体信息。它只注意到增加Pt负载量略微降低了催化剂的比表面积和孔体积，但并未改变Al2O3载体的整体结构特性。

要全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究来调查各种孔结构特性与PDH反应中的积碳形成、容纳以及催化剂性能之间的直接关系。这可以帮助阐明哪些孔结构特征对于最小化积碳和最大化催化剂稳定性和活性最为有利，从而为设计最佳和有效的催化剂提供信息。

The study focuses more on the effects of Pt particle size rather than support pore structure. It notes that increasing Pt loading slightly decreased surface area and pore volume, but did not change the overall structural properties of the alumina support. This implies that the support pore structure remained relatively constant across different catalyst samples, allowing the researchers to isolate the effects of Pt particle size on performance.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to specifically investigate how different pore structure characteristics affect coke formation, accommodation, and overall PDH performance. Such studies could provide valuable insights for designing optimal catalyst supports with pore structures that minimize coking and enhance catalyst effectiveness and longevity.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同特征如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到了具有高度开放结构的分级纳米氧化铝与商业氧化铝相比，能够改善传质、扩散动力学和催化剂结构稳定性。这表明孔结构特征如连通性和分层排列可以通过增强传质和稳定性来积极影响催化剂性能。

该研究更多地关注Pt粒子尺寸的影响，而不是载体孔结构。研究注意到，随着Pt负载量的增加，比表面积和孔体积略有下降，但并未改变氧化铝载体的整体结构特性。这意味着在不同的催化剂样品中，载体孔结构保持相对恒定，使研究人员能够单独研究Pt粒子尺寸对性能的影响。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究，专门调查不同的孔结构特征如何影响积碳形成、容纳和整体PDH性能。这样的研究可以为设计具有最佳孔结构的催化剂载体提供有价值的见解，从而最大程度地减少积碳并提高催化剂的有效性和寿命。

This could provide valuable insights for optimizing support structures to enhance catalyst effectiveness and longevity.

While the literature does not provide specific information on coke formation and accommodation in relation to pore structure, it can be inferred that improved mass transfer and diffusion properties of hierarchical structures may help mitigate coke accumulation and improve catalyst longevity. However, more research would be needed to fully understand these relationships and their implications for designing optimal PDH catalysts.
