[1] "Compared with commercial alumina, the hierarchical nanoalumina benefited from its highly open structure, and the stable surface property showed a remarkable ability to improve the mass-transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalysts structural stability."

[2] "The surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts with different loadings are 60.368.7 m2/g and 0.310.36 cm3/g, respectively. Following the improvement of Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process."

The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that hierarchical nanoalumina with a highly open structure improves mass transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalyst structural stability compared to commercial alumina. This suggests that pore structure characteristics like connectivity and hierarchical arrangements can positively impact overall catalyst performance by enhancing mass transfer and stability.

The text also notes that increasing Pt loading slightly decreased the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts, but did not change the structural properties of the alumina support. This implies that the support's pore structure remains relatively stable even as active metal loading increases, which could help maintain consistent catalyst performance.

While the literature does not provide specific information on coke formation and accommodation in relation to pore structure, it can be inferred that improved mass transfer and diffusion properties of hierarchical structures may help mitigate coke accumulation and improve catalyst longevity. However, more research would be needed to fully understand these relationships and their implications for designing optimal PDH catalysts.

文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、积碳容纳和整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到了具有高度开放结构的分级纳米氧化铝与商业氧化铝相比，能够改善传质、扩散动力学和催化剂结构稳定性。这表明孔结构特性如连通性和分级排列可以通过增强传质和稳定性来积极影响整体催化剂性能。

文中还指出，随着Pt负载量的增加，催化剂的比表面积和孔体积略有下降，但并未改变氧化铝载体的结构特性。这意味着即使活性金属负载量增加，载体的孔结构仍保持相对稳定，这可能有助于保持催化剂性能的一致性。

虽然文献没有提供关于孔结构与积碳形成和容纳之间关系的具体信息，但可以推断分级结构改善的传质和扩散特性可能有助于减少积碳累积并提高催化剂寿命。然而，需要进行更多研究以充分理解这些关系及其对设计最佳PDH催化剂的影响。
