[1] "Compared with commercial alumina, the hierarchical nanoalumina benefited from its highly open structure, and the stable surface property showed a remarkable ability to improve the mass-transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalysts structural stability."

[2] "The surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts with different loadings are 60.368.7 m2/g and 0.310.36 cm3/g, respectively. Following the improvement of Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process."

The literature does not directly address how different aspects of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation and catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does mention that hierarchical nanoalumina with a highly open structure improves mass transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalyst structural stability compared to commercial alumina. This suggests that pore structure characteristics like connectivity and hierarchical arrangements can positively impact overall catalyst performance.

The text also notes that increasing Pt loading slightly decreased the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts, but did not change the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials. This indicates that the support pore structure remains relatively stable even as active metal loading changes.

To fully answer the question, more specific research would be needed on how pore size, connectivity, uniformity and hierarchical arrangements directly affect coke formation and accommodation in PDH reactions. The implications for optimal catalyst design are not explicitly discussed in this literature.

该文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的不同方面如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积炭形成和催化剂性能。然而,它确实提到了具有高度开放结构的分层纳米氧化铝与商业氧化铝相比,可以改善传质、扩散动力学和催化剂结构稳定性。这表明孔结构特征如连通性和分层排列可以对整体催化剂性能产生积极影响。

文中还指出,随着Pt负载量的增加,催化剂的比表面积和孔体积略有下降,但Al2O3载体材料的结构性质并未改变。这表明即使活性金属负载量发生变化,载体孔结构仍保持相对稳定。

要全面回答这个问题,还需要对孔径、连通性、均匀性和分层排列如何直接影响PDH反应中的积炭形成和容纳进行更具体的研究。该文献中并未明确讨论这些对最佳催化剂设计的影响。
