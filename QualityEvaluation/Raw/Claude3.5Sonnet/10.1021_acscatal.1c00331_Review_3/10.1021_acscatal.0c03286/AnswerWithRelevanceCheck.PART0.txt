          [1] "Compared with commercial alumina, the hierarchical nanoalumina benefited from its highly open structure, and the stable surface property showed a remarkable ability to improve the mass-transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalysts structural stability."

          [2] "The surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts with different loadings are 60.368.7 m2/g and 0.310.36 cm3/g, respectively. Following the improvement of Pt loading, it was noticed that there was a slight decrease in the specific surface and pore volume, but the structural properties of the Al2O3 support materials were unchanged during the catalyst preparation process."

          The literature does not directly address how various characteristics of catalyst support pore structures influence coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it mentions that hierarchical nanoalumina with a highly open structure improves mass transfer, diffusion kinetics, and catalyst structural stability compared to commercial alumina. This suggests that pore structure characteristics like connectivity and hierarchical arrangements can positively impact overall catalyst performance by enhancing mass transfer and stability.

          The study focuses more on the effects of Pt particle size rather than support pore structure. It notes that increasing Pt loading slightly decreased the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts, but did not change the structural properties of the Al2O3 support. This indicates that the support pore structure remained relatively constant across the catalysts studied, so its effects on coke formation and performance were not a major variable examined.

          While the literature does not provide specific information on coke formation and accommodation in relation to pore structure, it can be inferred that improved mass transfer and diffusion properties of hierarchical structures may help mitigate coke accumulation and improve catalyst longevity.

          To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to systematically investigate how varying pore sizes, connectivity, uniformity and hierarchical arrangements in catalyst supports impact coke formation, accommodation and PDH performance. This could provide valuable insights for optimizing support structures to enhance catalyst effectiveness and longevity.

          文献并未直接讨论催化剂载体孔结构的各种特性如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的积碳形成、容纳以及整体催化剂性能。然而，它确实提到了具有高度开放结构的分层纳米氧化铝与商业氧化铝相比，能够改善传质、扩散动力学和催化剂结构稳定性。这表明孔结构特性，如连通性和分层排列，可以通过增强传质和稳定性来积极影响整体催化剂性能。

          该研究更多地关注Pt粒子尺寸的影响，而不是载体孔结构。研究注意到，随着Pt负载量的增加，比表面积和孔体积略有下降，但并未改变氧化铝载体的整体结构特性。这意味着在不同的催化剂样品中，载体孔结构保持相对恒定，使研究人员能够单独研究Pt粒子尺寸对性能的影响。

          虽然文献没有提供关于孔结构与积碳形成和容纳之间关系的具体信息，但可以推断分级结构改善的传质和扩散特性可能有助于减少积碳累积并提高催化剂寿命。

          要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行额外的研究，系统地调查催化剂载体中不同的孔径、连通性、均匀性和分层排列如何影响积碳形成、容纳和PDH性能。这可能为优化载体结构以提高催化剂效率和寿命提供宝贵的见解。
