The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about catalyst support pore structures and their influence on coke formation, accommodation, and overall catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document appears to be empty, so there is no content available to address the specific aspects of pore size, connectivity, uniformity, hierarchical arrangements, or their implications for designing optimal and effective catalysts for PDH reactions.
