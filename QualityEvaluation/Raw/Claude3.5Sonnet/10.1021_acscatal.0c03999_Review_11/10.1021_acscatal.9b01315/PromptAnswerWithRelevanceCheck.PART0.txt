The provided literature does not contain information about various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. The document focuses specifically on propane oxychlorination using metal phosphate catalysts, but does not discuss other halogen-assisted dehydrogenation methods or compare propane's reactivity to other alkanes.

To properly answer this question, additional sources would be needed to describe and compare dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches for propane conversion. The literature provided does not contain the necessary information to analyze the reaction conditions or differences in propane reactivity compared to methane and ethane in these processes.

The literature provided does not contain information about various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. The text focuses on propane oxychlorination using metal phosphate catalysts, but does not discuss other halogen-assisted dehydrogenation methods, oxidative dehydrogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. The document also does not provide a comparison of propane's reactivity to that of methane and ethane in these processes. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based solely on the given literature.

However, the document does provide some relevant information about propane oxychlorination:

1. Propane oxychlorination involves the reaction of propane with HCl and O2 to produce propylene.

2. Various metal phosphate catalysts (MPO, where M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were investigated for this reaction.

3. The reaction conditions typically involve temperatures between 673-773 K and feed concentrations of 1.5-6 vol% propane and 1.5-15 vol% HCl.

4. The mechanism is believed to proceed mainly via catalytic generation of C3H7Cl and its subsequent dehydrochlorination into C3H6.

5. The best performing catalyst, CrPO, achieved propylene yields up to 50% at 95% selectivity, which is comparable to or better than other propylene production technologies.

6. The reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts depend on factors such as their ability to evolve chlorine, dehydrochlorination kinetics, and propensity towards cracking and combustion reactions.

While this information provides insights into propane oxychlorination, it does not allow for a comprehensive comparison with other halogen-assisted methods or a discussion of propane's reactivity differences compared to methane and ethane.

所提供的文献中没有关于各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的信息。文本主要集中在使用金属磷酸盐催化剂进行丙烷氧氯化的研究，但没有讨论其他卤素辅助脱氢方法、氧化脱氢或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。文献也没有提供丙烷与甲烷和乙烷在这些过程中反应性的比较。因此，仅基于给定的文献无法全面回答这个问题。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于丙烷氧氯化的相关信息：

1. 丙烷氧氯化涉及丙烷与HCl和O2反应生成丙烯。

2. 研究了各种金属磷酸盐催化剂（MPO，其中M = Ti、V、Cr、Mn、Fe、Co、Ni、Cu）用于这一反应。

3. 反应条件通常涉及673-773 K的温度，以及1.5-6 vol%的丙烷和1.5-15 vol%的HCl进料浓度。

4. 反应机理被认为主要通过催化生成C3H7Cl及其随后的脱氯化氢生成C3H6来进行。

5. 性能最佳的催化剂CrPO在95%的选择性下实现了高达50%的丙烯产率，这与其他丙烯生产技术相当或更优。

6. 催化剂的反应性和选择性取决于诸如其释放氯的能力、脱氯化氢动力学以及对裂解和燃烧反应的倾向等因素。

虽然这些信息提供了对丙烷氧氯化的洞察，但它不足以对其他卤素辅助方法进行全面比较，也不足以讨论丙烷与甲烷和乙烷相比反应性的差异。

The given scientific literature does not contain information about various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. The document focuses specifically on propane oxychlorination using metal phosphate catalysts. It does not discuss other methods like dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. The literature also does not provide a comparison of propane's reactivity to other alkanes like methane and ethane in these processes.

However, based solely on the information provided about propane oxychlorination in the document, we can extend the answer to include some relevant details:

Propane oxychlorination is a method to produce propene using propane, HCl, and O2 as reactants. The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures between 673-773 K over metal phosphate catalysts. The mechanism is believed to proceed mainly through the catalytic generation of propyl chloride (C3H7Cl) followed by its dehydrochlorination to propene (C3H6). 

The reactivity and selectivity in this process depend significantly on the metal in the phosphate catalyst. For example, chromium phosphate (CrPO) showed the highest selectivity to propene (95-98%) at 5-20% propane conversion, while vanadium phosphate (VPO) had much lower selectivity (30-42%).

The document suggests that propane's reactivity in oxychlorination differs from simpler alkanes like ethane. It mentions that propane and/or propane derivatives are much more reactive compared to ethane-derived compounds, making selectivity control more challenging in propane oxychlorination.

提供的科学文献没有包含关于选择性地将丙烷脱氢制丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法的信息。该文件专门讨论了使用金属磷酸盐催化剂进行丙烷氧氯化。它没有讨论其他方法，如卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。文献也没有比较丙烷与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃在这些过程中的反应活性。

然而，仅基于文件中提供的关于丙烷氧氯化的信息，我们可以扩展答案以包括一些相关细节：

丙烷氧氯化是一种使用丙烷、HCl和O2作为反应物来生产丙烯的方法。该反应通常在673-773 K的温度下，通过金属磷酸盐催化剂进行。该机制被认为主要是通过催化生成氯丙烷（C3H7Cl），然后进行脱氢氯化生成丙烯（C3H6）。

这个过程中的反应活性和选择性很大程度上取决于磷酸盐催化剂中的金属。例如，磷酸铬（CrPO）在5-20%的丙烷转化率下显示出最高的丙烯选择性（95-98%），而磷酸钒（VPO）的选择性要低得多（30-42%）。

文件表明，丙烷在氧氯化中的反应性与乙烷等更简单的烷烃不同。它提到丙烷和/或丙烷衍生物比乙烷衍生化合物更具反应性，这使得在丙烷氧氯化中控制选择性更具挑战性。
