The given scientific literature does not contain information about halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. The document appears to focus on a different topic related to catalytic reactions, but does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation or compare various halogenation methods. There is no mention of dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane conversion. The text also does not provide details on reaction conditions for these processes or analyze the reactivity differences between propane and other alkanes like methane and ethane in such reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的科学文献中没有包含关于选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的卤素辅助方法的信息。该文档似乎集中讨论了与催化反应相关的不同主题，但并未具体讨论丙烷脱氢或比较各种卤化方法。文中没有提到用卤素进行脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法来转化丙烷。文本也没有提供这些过程的反应条件细节，或分析丙烷与甲烷和乙烷等其他烷烃在此类反应中的反应性差异。因此，基于给定文献中提供的信息，无法回答这个问题。
