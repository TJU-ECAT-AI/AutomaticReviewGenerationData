          [1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using halogens, especially iodine, has previously been explored by Shell and Petro-Tex"

[2] "If the reactions (1)-(3) are performed in one reactor, the total reaction will be oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction (4)). This reaction is thermodynamically very favourable and 100% conversion is expected."

[3] "Shell [3] has patented two different single-reactor systems, where the reactions (1)-(3) take place in different zones in the reactor, and a solid acceptor capable of binding hydrogen iodide as a halide is circulated in the system."

[4] "The high temperature reaction of propane with iodine to form propene and hydrogen iodide has been investigated earlier. The radical nature of the reactions seems to be well established [4,5]."

[5] "Iodine is produced from a salt melt (lithium iodide) and oxygen. Hydrogen iodide is removed by reaction with lithium hydroxide."

[6] "The reactions are assumed to be:
C3H8 + I2 → C3H6 + 2HI
2HI + 2LiOH → 2LiI + 2H2O
2LiI + 1/2O2 + H2O → 2LiOH + I2
C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O"

[7] "In the present work the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is accomplished in the presence of iodine and air."

[8] "Dehydrogenation of propane is performed in 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600C, with a propane/air mixture of 1:2"

[9] "Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations show that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities. The experimental results confirm this and indicate that the reaction proceeds by a radical mechanism."

[10] "A major factor governing propene reactivity is the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals. At the relatively high radical concentrations encountered in the system, benzene is the ultimate product."

          The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves directly reacting propane with halogens, especially iodine, at high temperatures to form propene and hydrogen halide. The reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method combines the use of halogens (particularly iodine) with oxygen. It is thermodynamically favorable and can achieve 100% conversion when reactions are performed in a single reactor. The overall reaction is C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O.

3. Oxyhalogenation: While not explicitly named, this process integrates halogen-based dehydrogenation with oxygen to regenerate the halogen. Iodine is produced from a lithium iodide salt melt and oxygen, then reacts with propane. Hydrogen iodide is removed by reaction with lithium hydroxide.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt as a reaction medium. Experiments are typically performed with 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600°C, with a propane/air mixture of 1:2.

Reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve:
- High temperatures (around 500-600°C)
- The presence of iodine or iodide salts
- Addition of air or oxygen
- Use of molten salt melts in some approaches
- Specialized reactor designs, such as Shell's patented single-reactor systems with different reaction zones

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure:
1. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon-hydrogen bonds, with the secondary C-H bonds being weaker and more reactive. This allows for easier abstraction of hydrogen atoms.
2. The ability to form both normal and isopropyl radicals leads to different reaction pathways and influences selectivity.
3. The formation of a stable double bond in propene provides a thermodynamic driving force not present in methane dehydrogenation and less favorable for ethane.
4. At high radical concentrations, propane can undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane.

The radical nature of the reaction mechanism and the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals significantly influence the selectivity towards propene. Lower temperatures generally favor higher propene selectivities by suppressing secondary reactions that lead to byproducts like benzene.

          文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及在高温下直接使丙烷与卤素（特别是碘）反应，形成丙烯和卤化氢。该反应通过自由基机制进行。

2. 氧化脱氢：这种方法结合了卤素（特别是碘）和氧气的使用。当反应在单个反应器中进行时，这个过程在热力学上是有利的，可以达到100%的转化率。总体反应为C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O。

3. 氧卤化：虽然没有明确命名，但这个过程将基于卤素的脱氢与氧气结合，以再生卤素。碘从碘化锂盐熔体和氧气中产生，然后与丙烷反应。氢碘通过与氢氧化锂反应被去除。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这种方法使用氢氧化锂/碘化锂盐熔体作为反应介质。实验通常在600°C下使用5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI盐熔体进行，丙烷与空气的混合比为1:2。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及：
- 高温（约500-600°C）
- 碘或碘化物盐的存在
- 添加空气或氧气
- 在某些方法中使用熔融盐熔体
- 专门的反应器设计，如壳牌公司专利的具有不同反应区的单反应器系统

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构：
1. 丙烷既有一级又有二级碳-氢键，其中二级C-H键更弱，更具反应性。这使得氢原子更容易被抽离。
2. 能够形成正丙基和异丙基自由基，导致不同的反应途径并影响选择性。
3. 丙烯中形成稳定双键提供了一个热力学驱动力，这在甲烷脱氢中不存在，对乙烷脱氢来说也不太有利。
4. 在高自由基浓度下，丙烷可以进行偶联反应形成较大分子如苯，这对甲烷来说是不可能的，对乙烷来说也不太可能。

反应机理的自由基性质和正丙基/异丙基自由基的比例显著影响了对丙烯的选择性。较低的温度通常有利于更高的丙烯选择性，因为它抑制了导致副产品（如苯）的二次反应。
