[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using halogens, especially iodine, has previously been explored by Shell and Petro-Tex"

[2] "If the reactions (1)-(3) are performed in one reactor, the total reaction will be oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction (4)). This reaction is thermodynamically very favourable and 100% conversion is expected."

[3] "Shell has patented two different single-reactor systems, where the reactions (1)-(3) take place in different zones in the reactor, and a solid acceptor capable of binding hydrogen iodide as a halide is circulated in the system."

[4] "The experiments are performed in a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt (starting content of LiOH = 2-5%)."

[5] "Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations show that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities. The experimental results confirm this and indicate that the reaction proceeds by a radical mechanism."

[6] "A major factor governing propene reactivity is the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals. At the relatively high radical concentrations encountered in the system, benzene is the ultimate product."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves using halogens, particularly iodine, to dehydrogenate propane. The process has been explored by companies like Shell and Petro-Tex.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method combines the use of halogens with oxygen. It is thermodynamically favorable and can achieve 100% conversion when reactions are performed in a single reactor.

3. Oxyhalogenation: While not explicitly named, this process is similar to oxidative dehydrogenation, involving the use of both halogens and oxygen.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: The experiments described in the literature use a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt, typically with 2-5% LiOH content.

Reaction conditions vary, but generally, lower temperatures are found to give higher propene selectivities. The reactions proceed through a radical mechanism, with the ratio of normal to isopropyl radicals being a key factor in propene reactivity.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, allowing for the formation of both normal and isopropyl radicals. This structural difference leads to more complex reaction pathways and the potential for higher selectivity towards propene. Additionally, the presence of these different radical species can lead to the formation of benzene as an ultimate product at high radical concentrations, which is not typically observed with methane or ethane.

The literature does not provide specific comparisons to methane and ethane reactivity, but the focus on propane suggests that its reactivity and potential for selective dehydrogenation are particularly interesting from an industrial perspective.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及使用卤素，特别是碘，来脱氢丙烷。这一过程已被壳牌和Petro-Tex等公司探索。

2. 氧化脱氢：这种方法结合了卤素和氧气的使用。当反应在单一反应器中进行时，这个过程在热力学上是有利的，可以实现100%的转化率。

3. 氧卤化：虽然没有明确命名，但这个过程类似于氧化脱氢，涉及卤素和氧气的使用。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：文献中描述的实验使用氢氧化锂/碘化锂盐熔体，通常含有2-5%的LiOH。

反应条件各不相同，但一般来说，较低的温度被发现可以获得更高的丙烯选择性。这些反应通过自由基机制进行，正丙基和异丙基自由基的比例是丙烯反应性的关键因素。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷同时具有伯碳和仲碳原子，允许形成正丙基和异丙基自由基。这种结构差异导致了更复杂的反应途径，以及获得更高丙烯选择性的潜力。此外，这些不同自由基物种的存在可以在高自由基浓度下导致苯的形成作为最终产物，这在甲烷或乙烷中通常不会观察到。

文献没有提供与甲烷和乙烷反应性的具体比较，但对丙烷的关注表明，从工业角度来看，其反应性和选择性脱氢的潜力特别有趣。
