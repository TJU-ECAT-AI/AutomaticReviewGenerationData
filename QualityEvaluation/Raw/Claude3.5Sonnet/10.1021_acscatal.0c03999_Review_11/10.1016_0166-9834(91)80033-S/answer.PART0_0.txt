The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves using halogens, especially iodine, to dehydrogenate propane. The process has been explored by companies like Shell and Petro-Tex.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method combines the use of halogens (particularly iodine) with oxygen. It is thermodynamically favorable and can achieve 100% conversion when reactions are performed in a single reactor.

3. Oxyhalogenation: While not explicitly named, this process is implied in the oxidative dehydrogenation method, where both oxygen and halogens (iodine) are used.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: The literature describes experiments using a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt at high temperatures (e.g., 600°C) with a mixture of propane and air.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve high temperatures (500-600°C), the presence of iodine or iodide salts, and often the addition of air or oxygen. The use of molten salt melts and specialized reactor designs are also mentioned.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon-hydrogen bonds, making it more reactive than methane (which has only primary C-H bonds) and ethane. This structural difference allows for easier abstraction of hydrogen atoms, particularly from the secondary carbon, leading to higher reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, the formation of stable allyl radicals from propane contributes to its unique reactivity in these halogen-assisted methods.

文献讨论了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及使用卤素，特别是碘，来脱氢丙烷。壳牌和Petro-Tex等公司已经探索了这一过程。

2. 氧化脱氢：这种方法结合了卤素（特别是碘）和氧气的使用。当反应在单个反应器中进行时，这个过程在热力学上是有利的，可以达到100%的转化率。

3. 氧卤化：虽然没有明确命名，但这个过程在氧化脱氢方法中是隐含的，其中同时使用氧气和卤素（碘）。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：文献描述了使用氢氧化锂/碘化锂盐熔体在高温（如600°C）下与丙烷和空气混合物进行的实验。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及高温（500-600°C），碘或碘化物盐的存在，以及经常添加空气或氧气。还提到了使用熔融盐熔体和专门的反应器设计。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷具有一级和二级碳氢键，使其比仅有一级C-H键的甲烷和乙烷更具反应性。这种结构差异允许更容易地从二级碳上抽取氢原子，导致在脱氢过程中具有更高的反应性和选择性。此外，丙烷形成稳定的烯丙基自由基的能力也contributes to its unique reactivity in these halogen-assisted methods。
