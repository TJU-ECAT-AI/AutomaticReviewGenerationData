[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using halogens, especially iodine, has previously been explored by Shell and Petro-Tex"

[2] "If the reactions (1)-(3) are performed in one reactor, the total reaction will be oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction (4)). This reaction is thermodynamically very favourable and 100% conversion is expected."

[3] "Shell has patented two different single-reactor systems, where the reactions (1)-(3) take place in different zones in the reactor, and a solid acceptor capable of binding hydrogen iodide as a halide is circulated in the system."

[4] "In the present work the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is accomplished in the presence of iodine and air."

[5] "Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations show that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities. The experimental results confirm this and indicate that the reaction proceeds by a radical mechanism."

[6] "A major factor governing propene reactivity is the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals. At the relatively high radical concentrations encountered in the system, benzene is the ultimate product."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves direct reaction of propane with halogens, especially iodine, to form propene and hydrogen halide.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This process uses oxygen along with halogens to dehydrogenate propane. The presence of oxygen makes the reaction thermodynamically favorable, allowing for higher conversions.

3. Oxyhalogenation: While not explicitly named, this is essentially what the oxidative dehydrogenation process describes - using both oxygen and halogens to dehydrogenate propane.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: The study focuses on using lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide melts as a reaction medium for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Reaction conditions vary, but generally involve temperatures around 500-600°C and the presence of air or oxygen along with the halogen (typically iodine). The process can be carried out in a single reactor or in multiple zones within a reactor.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon-hydrogen bonds, leading to the formation of both normal and isopropyl radicals. The ratio between these radicals significantly influences the selectivity towards propene. This complexity is not present in methane or ethane.

Furthermore, the radical nature of the reaction mechanism allows for the possibility of coupling reactions at higher conversions, leading to the formation of benzene as an ultimate product. This behavior is unique to propane and higher alkanes, and would not be observed with methane or ethane.

The study emphasizes that lower temperatures favor higher propene selectivity, likely due to the suppression of secondary reactions that lead to byproducts like benzene. This temperature dependence may differ for other alkanes.

Overall, the complex radical chemistry of propane in these halogen-assisted processes allows for greater control over product distribution, but also presents challenges in maximizing selectivity to the desired propene product.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及丙烷与卤素（特别是碘）的直接反应，形成丙烯和卤化氢。

2. 氧化脱氢：这个过程使用氧气和卤素来脱氢丙烷。氧气的存在使反应在热力学上更有利，允许更高的转化率。

3. 氧卤化：虽然没有明确命名，但这本质上就是氧化脱氢过程所描述的 - 使用氧气和卤素来脱氢丙烷。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：该研究专注于使用氢氧化锂/碘化锂熔体作为丙烷氧化脱氢的反应介质。

反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及500-600°C左右的温度，以及空气或氧气与卤素（通常是碘）的存在。该过程可以在单个反应器中或在反应器内的多个区域中进行。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷具有一级和二级碳-氢键，导致正丙基和异丙基自由基的形成。这些自由基之间的比例显著影响了对丙烯的选择性。这种复杂性在甲烷或乙烷中是不存在的。

此外，反应机理的自由基性质使得在高转化率下可能发生偶联反应，最终生成苯。这种行为对丙烷和更高级的烷烃是独特的，在甲烷或乙烷中不会观察到。

研究强调，较低的温度有利于更高的丙烯选择性，这可能是由于抑制了导致副产品（如苯）的二次反应。这种温度依赖性可能对其他烷烃有所不同。

总的来说，丙烷在这些卤素辅助过程中的复杂自由基化学允许对产物分布进行更大的控制，但也在最大化所需丙烯产物的选择性方面带来了挑战。
