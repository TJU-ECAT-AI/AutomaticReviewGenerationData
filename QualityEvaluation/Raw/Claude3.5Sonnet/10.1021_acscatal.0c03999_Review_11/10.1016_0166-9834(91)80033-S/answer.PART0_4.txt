[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using halogens, especially iodine, has previously been explored by Shell and Petro-Tex [2]. Iodine is produced from a salt melt (lithium iodide) and oxygen. Hydrogen iodide is removed by reaction with lithium hydroxide."

[2] "The reactions are assumed to be:
C3H8 + I2 → C3H6 + 2HI
2HI + 2LiOH → 2LiI + 2H2O
2LiI + 1/2O2 + H2O → 2LiOH + I2
C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O"

[3] "Shell [3] has patented two different single-reactor systems, where the reactions (1)-(3) take place in different zones in the reactor, and a solid acceptor capable of binding hydrogen iodide as a halide is circulated in the system."

[4] "The high temperature reaction of propane with iodine to form propene and hydrogen iodide has been investigated earlier. The radical nature of the reactions seems to be well established [4,5]."

[5] "Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations show that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities. The experimental results confirm this and indicate that the reaction proceeds by a radical mechanism."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves directly reacting propane with iodine at high temperatures to form propene and hydrogen iodide. The reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This process combines the dehydrogenation reaction with oxygen to make it thermodynamically more favorable. The overall reaction is C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O.

3. Oxyhalogenation: This approach integrates the halogen-based dehydrogenation with oxygen to regenerate the halogen. Iodine is produced from lithium iodide and oxygen, then reacts with propane. Hydrogen iodide is removed by reaction with lithium hydroxide.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt as a reaction medium. The reactions take place in the melt, with iodine serving as the dehydrogenating agent and being regenerated in situ.

The reaction conditions generally involve temperatures around 500-600°C, with varying ratios of propane to air/oxygen. Lower temperatures tend to give higher propene selectivities.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon-hydrogen bonds, with the secondary C-H bonds being weaker and more reactive. This allows for easier abstraction of hydrogen atoms to form propyl radicals, which can then eliminate to form propene. Methane and ethane only have primary C-H bonds, making them less reactive in these processes. Additionally, the formation of a stable double bond in propene provides a thermodynamic driving force that is not present for methane dehydrogenation and is less favorable for ethane.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及在高温下直接使丙烷与碘反应，形成丙烯和氢碘。该反应通过自由基机制进行。

2. 氧化脱氢：这个过程将脱氢反应与氧气结合，使其在热力学上更有利。总体反应为C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O。

3. 氧卤化：这种方法将基于卤素的脱氢与氧气结合，以再生卤素。碘从碘化锂和氧气中产生，然后与丙烷反应。氢碘通过与氢氧化锂反应被去除。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这种方法使用氢氧化锂/碘化锂盐熔体作为反应介质。反应在熔体中进行，碘作为脱氢剂并在原位再生。

反应条件通常涉及500-600°C左右的温度，丙烷与空气/氧气的比例各不相同。较低的温度往往会给出更高的丙烯选择性。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷既有伯碳-氢键，也有仲碳-氢键，其中仲C-H键更弱，更具反应性。这使得氢原子更容易被抽离形成丙基自由基，然后可以消除形成丙烯。甲烷和乙烷只有伯C-H键，使它们在这些过程中反应性较低。此外，丙烯中形成稳定双键提供了一个热力学驱动力，这在甲烷脱氢中不存在，对乙烷脱氢来说也不太有利。
