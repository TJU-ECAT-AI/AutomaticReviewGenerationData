[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using halogens, especially iodine, has previously been explored by Shell and Petro-Tex [2]."

[2] "Iodine is produced from a salt melt (lithium iodide) and oxygen. Hydrogen iodide is removed by reaction with lithium hydroxide."

[3] "If the reactions (1)-(3) are performed in one reactor, the total reaction will be oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction (4))."

[4] "Another concept is to separate the reactions into several reactors. Iodine may be produced in one reactor (reaction (3)). In the next reactor propane can be dehydrogenated by iodine and the hydrogen iodide produced can be adsorbed by lithium hydroxide (reaction (1) and (2))."

[5] "The high temperature reaction of propane with iodine to form propene and hydrogen iodide has been investigated earlier. The radical nature of the reactions seems to be well established [4,5]."

[6] "In the present work the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is accomplished in the presence of iodine and air."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves the direct reaction of propane with halogen (particularly iodine) at high temperatures to form propene and hydrogen halide.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses oxygen along with a halogen catalyst. The presence of oxygen makes the reaction more thermodynamically favorable.

3. Oxyhalogenation: While not explicitly mentioned, this can be inferred as a combination of oxidation and halogenation processes.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: The study focuses on using lithium iodide/lithium hydroxide melts as a reaction medium.

Reaction conditions vary for each method:

- High temperatures are generally required for all methods.
- The presence of oxygen differentiates oxidative dehydrogenation from direct halogen dehydrogenation.
- Molten salt methods involve a liquid reaction medium, unlike gas-phase reactions.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to:

1. The presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane, which are more reactive than primary carbons.
2. The ability of propane to form both normal and iso-propyl radicals, leading to different reaction pathways.
3. The lower C-H bond strength in propane compared to methane and ethane, making it more reactive.
4. The potential for propane to undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane.

These factors contribute to propane's unique reactivity profile in halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes, making it a more suitable candidate for selective conversion to propene compared to smaller alkanes.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯的方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及丙烷与卤素（特别是碘）在高温下直接反应，形成丙烯和卤化氢。

2. 氧化脱氢：这种方法使用氧气和卤素催化剂。氧气的存在使反应在热力学上更有利。

3. 氧卤化：虽然没有明确提及，但可以推断为氧化和卤化过程的结合。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：该研究主要关注使用碘化锂/氢氧化锂熔体作为反应介质。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同：

- 所有方法通常都需要高温。
- 氧气的存在区分了氧化脱氢和直接卤素脱氢。
- 熔融盐方法涉及液体反应介质，不同于气相反应。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，原因如下：

1. 丙烷中存在二级碳原子，比一级碳原子更具反应性。
2. 丙烷能够形成正丙基和异丙基自由基，导致不同的反应途径。
3. 与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键强度较低，使其更具反应性。
4. 丙烷有潜力进行偶联反应形成较大分子如苯，这对甲烷来说是不可能的，对乙烷来说也不太可能。

这些因素共同造就了丙烷在卤素辅助脱氢过程中独特的反应性特征，使其相比小分子烷烃更适合选择性转化为丙烯。
