          "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

"Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts."

"Propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate gave prominent C2H5Br instead of C3H7Br in the low-temperature region, and the propylene selectivity increased rapidly at the compensation of C2H5Br with increasing temperature."

"Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators."

"Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

"A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

"For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

"Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

          Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This method, particularly iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes. It involves high-temperature reactions (>673 K) between iodine and propane to produce propene and HI. The reaction follows a radical mechanism and is selective but slow at lower temperatures.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This approach uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts in the presence of oxygen. It allows for lower reaction temperatures (typically 700-900 K) compared to direct iodination and shifts the equilibrium constraint. However, overoxidation to carbon oxides can lower feedstock utilization.

3. Oxyhalogenation: This process uses bromine and oxygen to convert propane. Vanadium phosphate catalysts are used for propane oxybromination. At low temperatures, it produces mainly ethyl bromide, but propylene selectivity increases rapidly with temperature (typically 750-850 K).

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: These use metal iodides (e.g., LiI) as catalysts and hydrogen iodide acceptors. The reaction occurs at 700-900 K, with the molten salts helping to manage heat and shift equilibrium.

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at moderate temperatures below 800 K.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which have only primary carbons. This allows for easier C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Additionally, propane can form more stable intermediate species and undergo dehydrogenation more readily to produce propene. In contrast, methane activation is more challenging due to its strong C-H bonds, while ethane tends to form ethylene or ethyl halides more readily than propene in similar reactions.

          卤素辅助的丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的方法包括：

1. 卤素脱氢：这种方法，特别是碘介导的脱氢，通常比传统路线提供更高的丙烯产率。它涉及高温（>673 K）下碘和丙烷之间的反应，生成丙烯和HI。反应遵循自由基机理，在较低温度下具有选择性但反应较慢。

2. 氧化脱氢：这种方法使用碘化物基熔融盐作为催化剂，在氧气存在下进行。与直接碘化相比，它允许较低的反应温度（通常为700-900 K），并移动平衡约束。然而，过度氧化为碳氧化物可能会降低原料利用率。

3. 氧卤化：这个过程使用溴和氧来转化丙烷。钒磷酸盐催化剂用于丙烷氧溴化。在低温下，主要产生溴乙烷，但随着温度升高（通常为750-850 K），丙烯的选择性迅速增加。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这些方法使用金属碘化物（如LiI）作为催化剂和氢碘酸接受体。反应在700-900 K下进行，熔融盐有助于管理热量并移动平衡。

5. 双卤素介导的脱氢：这种创新方法同时使用Br2和I2作为介质。在碘化反应中添加少量溴能显著促进丙烷转化和产物选择性。在800 K以下的适度温度下可获得高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙基的高收率。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷同时具有伯碳和仲碳原子，使其比只有伯碳的甲烷和乙烷更具反应性。这允许更容易的C-H键活化和脱氢。此外，丙烷可以形成更稳定的中间体物种，更容易进行脱氢生成丙烯。相比之下，由于甲烷具有强C-H键，其活化更具挑战性，而乙烷在类似反应中倾向于更容易形成乙烯或乙基卤化物，而不是丙烯。
