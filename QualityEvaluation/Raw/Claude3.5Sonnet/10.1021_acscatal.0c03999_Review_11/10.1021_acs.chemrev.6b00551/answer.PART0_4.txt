[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane)."

[4] "Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

[5] "Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

[6] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This method uses iodine as a mediator. It reacts slowly but selectively with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane, which then undergoes dehydroiodination to produce propylene. This route generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional dehydrogenation methods.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This approach uses molten iodinated salts and oxygen. It leads to better propylene yields than simple iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, but overoxidation to carbon oxides can lower feedstock utilization.

3. Oxyhalogenation: While not explicitly mentioned for propane, this method combines a halogen (typically HCl or HBr) with oxygen to dehydrogenate the alkane.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: This involves using molten iodinated salts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It provides better propylene yields but faces challenges with overoxidation.

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity. This method achieves high yields (up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X) at moderate temperatures below 800 K.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. With three carbon atoms, propane is more reactive than methane and ethane, making it easier to dehydrogenate. The presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane also contributes to its higher reactivity. Additionally, the C-H bond strength in propane is lower than in methane and ethane, facilitating easier hydrogen abstraction during dehydrogenation reactions.

丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的卤素辅助方法包括：

1. 卤素脱氢：此方法使用碘作为介质。它在低温下与丙烷缓慢但选择性地反应形成碘丙烷，然后通过脱碘化氢生成丙烯。与传统脱氢方法相比，这种路线通常能获得更高的丙烯产率。

2. 氧化脱氢：该方法使用熔融碘化盐和氧气。它比单纯的碘介导脱氢能获得更好的丙烯产率，但过度氧化为碳氧化物可能会降低原料利用率。

3. 氧卤化：虽然没有明确提到用于丙烷，但这种方法结合了卤素（通常是HCl或HBr）和氧气来脱氢烷烃。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这涉及使用熔融碘化盐进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。它提供了更好的丙烯产率，但面临过度氧化的挑战。

5. 双卤素介导脱氢：这种新颖的方法同时使用Br2和I2作为介质。在碘化反应中添加少量溴能显著提高丙烷转化率和产品选择性。该方法在800 K以下的适度温度下实现了高达80%的C3H6+C3H7X产率。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷有三个碳原子，比甲烷和乙烷更具反应性，更容易脱氢。丙烷中存在的仲碳原子也增加了其反应活性。此外，丙烷的C-H键强度低于甲烷和乙烷，这有利于在脱氢反应过程中更容易地进行氢原子的脱除。
