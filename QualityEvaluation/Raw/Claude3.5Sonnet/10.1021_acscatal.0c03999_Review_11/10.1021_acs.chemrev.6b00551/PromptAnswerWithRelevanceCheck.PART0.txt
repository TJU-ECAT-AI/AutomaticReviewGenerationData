[1] "Raley et al. studied the high-temperature (T > 673 K) reactions between iodine and hydrocarbons and demonstrated that a variety of paraffins can be dehydrogenated to corresponding monoolefins with the formation of stoichiometric HI."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The difference between iodide- and chloride-catalyzed dehydrogenation processes can be visualized from the reaction products: while iodine substitution products are commonly observed over iodide-based molten salts, no chlorinated compounds are formed over metal chloride catalysts."

[3] "An integrated process for the functionalization of natural gas with bromine was proposed by McFarland and Stucky et al. in 2003. A multiple-step conversion from methane to oxygenates (methanol and dimethyl ether, DME) was disclosed in the patent, comprising methane bromination and metal oxide-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl bromide in separate reactors."

[4] "Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products (Figure 43c). A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

[5] "Propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate gave prominent C2H5Br instead of C3H7Br in the low-temperature region, and the propylene selectivity increased rapidly at the compensation of C2H5Br with increasing temperature."

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves high-temperature reactions (>673 K) between iodine and propane to produce propene and HI. The process is selective but requires high temperatures.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation with molten metal halide salts: This uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts. It produces iodine substitution products along with propene. The reaction conditions are milder compared to direct halogenation.

3. Oxyhalogenation: This process uses bromine and oxygen to convert propane. At low temperatures, it produces mainly ethyl bromide. As temperature increases, propene selectivity increases.

4. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. It achieves high yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) at moderate temperatures below 800 K. 

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to:

- Easier C-H bond activation in propane compared to methane
- Different thermodynamics favoring dehydrogenation for propane
- Formation of more stable intermediates with propane
- Ability to form multiple products (e.g. propene, propyl halides) from propane

The bihalogen approach seems particularly promising for propane, as it combines the high reactivity of bromine with the selectivity of iodine at relatively low temperatures. This method is less suitable for methane due to its lower reactivity.

卤素辅助的丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的方法包括：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及高温（>673 K）下碘和丙烷之间的反应，生成丙烯和HI。该过程具有选择性，但需要高温。

2. 熔融金属卤化物盐氧化脱氢：使用碘化物基熔融盐作为催化剂。它同时产生碘取代产物和丙烯。与直接卤化相比，反应条件较温和。

3. 氧卤化：这个过程使用溴和氧来转化丙烷。在低温下，主要产生溴乙烷。随着温度升高，丙烯的选择性增加。

4. 双卤素介导的脱氢：这种新方法同时使用Br2和I2作为介质。在800 K以下的适度温度下，可以达到高达80%的丙烯和丙基卤化物的产率。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，原因如下：

- 与甲烷相比，丙烷的C-H键活化更容易
- 有利于丙烷脱氢的不同热力学特性
- 丙烷形成更稳定的中间体
- 能够从丙烷形成多种产物（如丙烯、丙基卤化物）

双卤素方法对丙烷特别有前景，因为它在相对较低的温度下结合了溴的高反应性和碘的选择性。由于甲烷反应性较低，这种方法不太适合甲烷。

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation provides higher propylene yields compared to conventional methods. The reaction typically occurs at temperatures around 700-800 K.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts. The presence of oxygen makes the reaction more exothermic and shifts the equilibrium, allowing for higher conversions at lower temperatures (typically 700-900 K) compared to direct iodination.

3. Oxyhalogenation: Vanadium phosphate catalysts are used for propane oxybromination. At low temperatures, the main product is ethyl bromide, but propylene selectivity increases rapidly with temperature. The reaction is typically carried out at 750-850 K.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: These use metal iodides (e.g., LiI) as catalysts and hydrogen iodide acceptors. The reaction occurs at 700-900 K, with the molten salts helping to manage heat and shift equilibrium.

5. Bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation: This innovative approach uses both bromine and iodine. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity at moderate temperatures (below 800 K).

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which have only primary carbons. This allows for easier C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Additionally, the formation of a stable propene molecule with a double bond is more favorable compared to the highly reactive methylene or unstable ethylene radical formed from methane or ethane, respectively. This difference in reactivity and product stability contributes to the higher yields and selectivities observed in propane dehydrogenation processes compared to those of methane and ethane.

丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的卤素辅助方法包括：

1. 卤素脱氢：碘介导的脱氢反应比传统方法提供更高的丙烯产率。反应通常在700-800 K的温度下进行。

2. 氧化脱氢：这种方法使用碘化物熔盐作为催化剂。氧气的存在使反应更加放热并移动平衡，允许在较低温度（通常为700-900 K）下获得较高的转化率，相比直接碘化反应。

3. 氧卤化：钒磷酸盐催化剂用于丙烷氧溴化。在低温下，主要产物是溴乙烷，但随着温度升高，丙烯选择性迅速增加。反应通常在750-850 K下进行。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这些方法使用金属碘化物（如LiI）作为催化剂和氢碘酸接受体。反应在700-900 K下进行，熔融盐有助于管理热量并移动平衡。

5. 双卤素辅助脱氢：这种创新方法同时使用溴和碘。在碘化反应中添加少量溴能显著促进丙烷转化和产物选择性，在适中温度下（低于800 K）进行。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷同时具有伯碳和仲碳原子，使其比只有伯碳的甲烷和乙烷更具反应性。这允许更容易的C-H键活化和脱氢。此外，形成稳定的丙烯分子（具有双键）比从甲烷或乙烷形成高度活性的亚甲基或不稳定的乙烯基自由基更有利。这种反应性和产物稳定性的差异导致丙烷脱氢过程中观察到的产率和选择性高于甲烷和乙烷。

A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

[5] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. (46, 337) It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures (Figure 43b)."

The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation: This occurs at high temperatures (>673 K) and involves the reaction of iodine with propane to form propene and HI. The reaction is selective but slow at lower temperatures.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation with iodide-based molten salts: This method uses metal iodides as catalysts and typically operates at lower temperatures than direct iodination. Iodine substitution products are observed in this process.

3. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: This low-temperature route uses a combination of Br2 and I2. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly improves propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at temperatures below 800 K.

4. Metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation: While not specifically discussed for propane, the literature mentions that chloride-based catalysts do not form chlorinated compounds, unlike iodide-based catalysts.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. As a C3 molecule, propane is more reactive than methane (C1) and ethane (C2) because:

1. It has weaker C-H bonds, making it easier to dehydrogenate.
2. It can form a more stable intermediate (propyl radical) during the reaction.
3. The resulting propene is thermodynamically more favorable than ethylene or methylene.

These factors allow propane to undergo dehydrogenation more readily and selectively than methane or ethane, especially in the presence of halogens. The bihalogen approach is particularly effective for propane, as it combines the high reactivity of bromine with the selectivity of iodine, enabling high yields at lower temperatures.

2. 碘化物熔盐催化的氧化脱氢：这种方法使用金属碘化物作为催化剂，通常在比直接碘化更低的温度下进行。在这个过程中可以观察到碘取代产物。

3. 双卤素介导的脱氢：这是一种低温路线，使用Br2和I2的组合。在碘化反应中加入少量溴可显著提高丙烷转化率和产品选择性。在800 K以下的温度可获得高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙基的高收率。

4. 金属氯化物催化的氧化脱氢：虽然文献没有具体讨论丙烷的情况，但提到基于氯化物的催化剂不会形成氯化化合物，这与基于碘化物的催化剂不同。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构所致。作为C3分子，丙烷比甲烷（C1）和乙烷（C2）更具反应活性，原因如下：

1. 它具有更弱的C-H键，更容易脱氢。
2. 在反应过程中可以形成更稳定的中间体（丙基自由基）。
3. 生成的丙烯在热力学上比乙烯或亚甲基更有利。

这些因素使得丙烷在卤素存在的情况下比甲烷或乙烷更容易发生脱氢反应，且具有更高的选择性。双卤素方法对丙烷特别有效，因为它结合了溴的高反应性和碘的选择性，能够在较低温度下获得高收率。

Several halogen-assisted methods have been developed for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation is particularly effective, yielding higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes. The reaction follows a radical mechanism and typically occurs at high temperatures (>700 K).

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts in the presence of oxygen. It allows for lower reaction temperatures compared to direct iodination and shifts the equilibrium constraint by continuous oxidation of HI byproduct.

3. Oxyhalogenation: Vanadium phosphate catalysts have been used for propane oxybromination. At low temperatures, C2H5Br is the main product, while propylene selectivity increases rapidly with temperature.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: Alkali metal iodides (e.g., LiI) are used as catalysts, often with the addition of metal oxides as hydrogen iodide acceptors. These reactions typically occur at temperatures between 700-900 K.

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: A novel low-temperature route using both Br2 and I2 as mediators has been developed. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. With three carbon atoms, propane can more easily form stable intermediate species and undergo dehydrogenation to produce propene. In contrast, methane activation is more challenging due to its strong C-H bonds, while ethane tends to form ethylene or ethyl halides more readily than propene in similar reactions.

几种卤素辅助方法已被开发用于选择性地将丙烷脱氢成丙烯：

1. 卤素脱氢：碘介导的脱氢特别有效，与传统路线相比产生更高的丙烯收率。反应遵循自由基机理，通常在高温下进行（>700 K）。

2. 氧化脱氢：该方法使用碘化物基熔盐作为催化剂，在氧气存在下进行。与直接碘化相比，它允许较低的反应温度，并通过连续氧化HI副产物来移动平衡约束。

3. 氧卤化：五氧化二钒磷酸盐催化剂已用于丙烷氧溴化。在低温下，C2H5Br是主要产物，而丙烯选择性随温度快速增加。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：碱金属碘化物（如LiI）被用作催化剂，通常添加金属氧化物作为碘化氢接受剂。这些反应通常在700-900 K的温度下进行。

5. 双卤素介导脱氢：已开发出一种使用Br2和I2作为介质的新型低温路线。在碘化反应中添加少量溴显著促进了丙烷转化和产物选择性。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷有三个碳原子，可以更容易地形成稳定的中间物种并进行脱氢生成丙烯。相比之下，由于甲烷具有强C-H键，其活化更具挑战性，而乙烷在类似反应中倾向于更容易形成乙烯或乙基卤化物，而不是丙烯。

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: This involves using molten iodinated salts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It provides better propylene yields but faces challenges with overoxidation.
