[1] "Raley et al. studied the high-temperature (T > 673 K) reactions between iodine and hydrocarbons and demonstrated that a variety of paraffins can be dehydrogenated to corresponding monoolefins with the formation of stoichiometric HI."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The difference between iodide- and chloride-catalyzed dehydrogenation processes can be visualized from the reaction products: while iodine substitution products are commonly observed over iodide-based molten salts, no chlorinated compounds are formed over metal chloride catalysts."

[3] "Besides, high-temperature reactions of iodine with long-chain hydrocarbons (C6+) can lead to aromatization of higher aliphatic hydrocarbons (339) and the rearrangement of aliphatic free radicals (e.g., CH3C(CH3)R1CH = CR2R3  CH3CHR1CH2CH = CR2R3, R1, R2, R3 = H or CH3)."

[4] "Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. (348) Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products (Figure 43c). A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

[5] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. (46, 337) It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures (Figure 43b)."

The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation: This occurs at high temperatures (>673 K) and involves the reaction of iodine with propane to form propene and HI. The reaction is selective but slow at lower temperatures.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation with iodide-based molten salts: This method uses metal iodides as catalysts and typically operates at lower temperatures than direct iodination. Iodine substitution products are observed in this process.

3. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: This low-temperature route uses a combination of Br2 and I2. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly improves propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at temperatures below 800 K.

4. Metal chloride-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation: While not specifically discussed for propane, the literature mentions that chloride-based catalysts do not form chlorinated compounds, unlike iodide-based catalysts.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. As a C3 molecule, propane is more reactive than methane (C1) and ethane (C2) because:

1. It has weaker C-H bonds, making it easier to dehydrogenate.
2. It can form a more stable intermediate (propyl radical) during the reaction.
3. The resulting propene is thermodynamically more favorable than ethylene or methylene.

These factors allow propane to undergo dehydrogenation more readily and selectively than methane or ethane, especially in the presence of halogens. The bihalogen approach is particularly effective for propane, as it combines the high reactivity of bromine with the selectivity of iodine, enabling high yields at lower temperatures.

文献讨论了几种卤素辅助的丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 碘介导的脱氢：这种反应在高温下进行（>673 K），涉及碘与丙烷反应生成丙烯和HI。在较低温度下，该反应具有选择性但反应较慢。

2. 碘化物熔盐催化的氧化脱氢：这种方法使用金属碘化物作为催化剂，通常在比直接碘化更低的温度下进行。在这个过程中可以观察到碘取代产物。

3. 双卤素介导的脱氢：这是一种低温路线，使用Br2和I2的组合。在碘化反应中加入少量溴可显著提高丙烷转化率和产品选择性。在800 K以下的温度可获得高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙基的高收率。

4. 金属氯化物催化的氧化脱氢：虽然文献没有具体讨论丙烷的情况，但提到基于氯化物的催化剂不会形成氯化化合物，这与基于碘化物的催化剂不同。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构所致。作为C3分子，丙烷比甲烷（C1）和乙烷（C2）更具反应活性，原因如下：

1. 它具有更弱的C-H键，更容易脱氢。
2. 在反应过程中可以形成更稳定的中间体（丙基自由基）。
3. 生成的丙烯在热力学上比乙烯或亚甲基更有利。

这些因素使得丙烷在卤素存在的情况下比甲烷或乙烷更容易发生脱氢反应，且具有更高的选择性。双卤素方法对丙烷特别有效，因为它结合了溴的高反应性和碘的选择性，能够在较低温度下获得高收率。
