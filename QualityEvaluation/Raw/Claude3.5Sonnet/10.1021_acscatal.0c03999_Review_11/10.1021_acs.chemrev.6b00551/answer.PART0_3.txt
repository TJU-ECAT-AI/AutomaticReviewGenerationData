Several halogen-assisted methods have been developed for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation is particularly effective, yielding higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes. The reaction follows a radical mechanism and typically occurs at high temperatures (>700 K).

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts in the presence of oxygen. It allows for lower reaction temperatures compared to direct iodination and shifts the equilibrium constraint by continuous oxidation of HI byproduct.

3. Oxyhalogenation: Vanadium phosphate catalysts have been used for propane oxybromination. At low temperatures, C2H5Br is the main product, while propylene selectivity increases rapidly with temperature.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: Alkali metal iodides (e.g., LiI) are used as catalysts, often with the addition of metal oxides as hydrogen iodide acceptors. These reactions typically occur at temperatures between 700-900 K.

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: A novel low-temperature route using both Br2 and I2 as mediators has been developed. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. With three carbon atoms, propane can more easily form stable intermediate species and undergo dehydrogenation to produce propene. In contrast, methane activation is more challenging due to its strong C-H bonds, while ethane tends to form ethylene or ethyl halides more readily than propene in similar reactions.

几种卤素辅助方法已被开发用于选择性地将丙烷脱氢成丙烯：

1. 卤素脱氢：碘介导的脱氢特别有效，与传统路线相比产生更高的丙烯收率。反应遵循自由基机理，通常在高温下进行（>700 K）。

2. 氧化脱氢：该方法使用碘化物基熔盐作为催化剂，在氧气存在下进行。与直接碘化相比，它允许较低的反应温度，并通过连续氧化HI副产物来移动平衡约束。

3. 氧卤化：五氧化二钒磷酸盐催化剂已用于丙烷氧溴化。在低温下，C2H5Br是主要产物，而丙烯选择性随温度快速增加。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：碱金属碘化物（如LiI）被用作催化剂，通常添加金属氧化物作为碘化氢接受剂。这些反应通常在700-900 K的温度下进行。

5. 双卤素介导脱氢：已开发出一种使用Br2和I2作为介质的新型低温路线。在碘化反应中添加少量溴显著促进了丙烷转化和产物选择性。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷有三个碳原子，可以更容易地形成稳定的中间物种并进行脱氢生成丙烯。相比之下，由于甲烷具有强C-H键，其活化更具挑战性，而乙烷在类似反应中倾向于更容易形成乙烯或乙基卤化物，而不是丙烯。
