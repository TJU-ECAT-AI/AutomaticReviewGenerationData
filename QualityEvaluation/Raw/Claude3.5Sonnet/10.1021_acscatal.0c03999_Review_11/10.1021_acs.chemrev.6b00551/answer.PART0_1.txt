[1] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts."

[3] "Propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate gave prominent C2H5Br instead of C3H7Br in the low-temperature region, and the propylene selectivity increased rapidly at the compensation of C2H5Br with increasing temperature."

[4] "A comparative experiment showed that the direct bromination of C3H8 involved a batch of sequential substitution reactions, leading to inferior selectivity of the desired product. The addition of iodine into the bromination process accelerated the formation of C3H6 by reducing the main side-reaction from 2-C3H7Br to 2,2-C3H6Br2."

[5] "Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation provides higher propylene yields compared to conventional methods. The reaction typically occurs at temperatures around 700-800 K.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts. The presence of oxygen makes the reaction more exothermic and shifts the equilibrium, allowing for higher conversions at lower temperatures (typically 700-900 K) compared to direct iodination.

3. Oxyhalogenation: Vanadium phosphate catalysts are used for propane oxybromination. At low temperatures, the main product is ethyl bromide, but propylene selectivity increases rapidly with temperature. The reaction is typically carried out at 750-850 K.

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: These use metal iodides (e.g., LiI) as catalysts and hydrogen iodide acceptors. The reaction occurs at 700-900 K, with the molten salts helping to manage heat and shift equilibrium.

5. Bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation: This innovative approach uses both bromine and iodine. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity at moderate temperatures (below 800 K).

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which have only primary carbons. This allows for easier C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Additionally, the formation of a stable propene molecule with a double bond is more favorable compared to the highly reactive methylene or unstable ethylene radical formed from methane or ethane, respectively. This difference in reactivity and product stability contributes to the higher yields and selectivities observed in propane dehydrogenation processes compared to those of methane and ethane.

丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的卤素辅助方法包括：

1. 卤素脱氢：碘介导的脱氢反应比传统方法提供更高的丙烯产率。反应通常在700-800 K的温度下进行。

2. 氧化脱氢：这种方法使用碘化物熔盐作为催化剂。氧气的存在使反应更加放热并移动平衡，允许在较低温度（通常为700-900 K）下获得较高的转化率，相比直接碘化反应。

3. 氧卤化：钒磷酸盐催化剂用于丙烷氧溴化。在低温下，主要产物是溴乙烷，但随着温度升高，丙烯选择性迅速增加。反应通常在750-850 K下进行。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这些方法使用金属碘化物（如LiI）作为催化剂和氢碘酸接受体。反应在700-900 K下进行，熔融盐有助于管理热量并移动平衡。

5. 双卤素辅助脱氢：这种创新方法同时使用溴和碘。在碘化反应中添加少量溴能显著促进丙烷转化和产物选择性，在适中温度下（低于800 K）进行。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷同时具有伯碳和仲碳原子，使其比只有伯碳的甲烷和乙烷更具反应性。这允许更容易的C-H键活化和脱氢。此外，形成稳定的丙烯分子（具有双键）比从甲烷或乙烷形成高度活性的亚甲基或不稳定的乙烯基自由基更有利。这种反应性和产物稳定性的差异导致丙烷脱氢过程中观察到的产率和选择性高于甲烷和乙烷。
