[1] "Raley et al. studied the high-temperature (T > 673 K) reactions between iodine and hydrocarbons and demonstrated that a variety of paraffins can be dehydrogenated to corresponding monoolefins with the formation of stoichiometric HI."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The difference between iodide- and chloride-catalyzed dehydrogenation processes can be visualized from the reaction products: while iodine substitution products are commonly observed over iodide-based molten salts, no chlorinated compounds are formed over metal chloride catalysts."

[3] "An integrated process for the functionalization of natural gas with bromine was proposed by McFarland and Stucky et al. in 2003. A multiple-step conversion from methane to oxygenates (methanol and dimethyl ether, DME) was disclosed in the patent, comprising methane bromination and metal oxide-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl bromide in separate reactors."

[4] "Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products (Figure 43c). A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

[5] "Propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate gave prominent C2H5Br instead of C3H7Br in the low-temperature region, and the propylene selectivity increased rapidly at the compensation of C2H5Br with increasing temperature."

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves high-temperature reactions (>673 K) between iodine and propane to produce propene and HI. The process is selective but requires high temperatures.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation with molten metal halide salts: This uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts. It produces iodine substitution products along with propene. The reaction conditions are milder compared to direct halogenation.

3. Oxyhalogenation: This process uses bromine and oxygen to convert propane. At low temperatures, it produces mainly ethyl bromide. As temperature increases, propene selectivity increases.

4. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. It achieves high yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) at moderate temperatures below 800 K. 

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to:

- Easier C-H bond activation in propane compared to methane
- Different thermodynamics favoring dehydrogenation for propane
- Formation of more stable intermediates with propane
- Ability to form multiple products (e.g. propene, propyl halides) from propane

The bihalogen approach seems particularly promising for propane, as it combines the high reactivity of bromine with the selectivity of iodine at relatively low temperatures. This method is less suitable for methane due to its lower reactivity.

卤素辅助的丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的方法包括：

1. 卤素脱氢：这涉及高温（>673 K）下碘和丙烷之间的反应，生成丙烯和HI。该过程具有选择性，但需要高温。

2. 熔融金属卤化物盐氧化脱氢：使用碘化物基熔融盐作为催化剂。它同时产生碘取代产物和丙烯。与直接卤化相比，反应条件较温和。

3. 氧卤化：这个过程使用溴和氧来转化丙烷。在低温下，主要产生溴乙烷。随着温度升高，丙烯的选择性增加。

4. 双卤素介导的脱氢：这种新方法同时使用Br2和I2作为介质。在800 K以下的适度温度下，可以达到高达80%的丙烯和丙基卤化物的产率。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，原因如下：

- 与甲烷相比，丙烷的C-H键活化更容易
- 有利于丙烷脱氢的不同热力学特性
- 丙烷形成更稳定的中间体
- 能够从丙烷形成多种产物（如丙烯、丙基卤化物）

双卤素方法对丙烷特别有前景，因为它在相对较低的温度下结合了溴的高反应性和碘的选择性。由于甲烷反应性较低，这种方法不太适合甲烷。
