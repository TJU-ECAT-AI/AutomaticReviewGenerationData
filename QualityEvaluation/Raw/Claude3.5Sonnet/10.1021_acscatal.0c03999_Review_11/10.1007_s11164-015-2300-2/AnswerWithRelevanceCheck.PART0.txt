          "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can produce propylene. Propane dehydrogenation reaction is shown in (Eq. 1) [1, 2]."

"C3H8 ⇌ C3H6 + H2, ΔH298 = 129 kJ/mol"

"PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."

"PDH at higher temperatures may increase the propylene yield, however, also leads to unfavorable side reactions and accelerates catalyst deactivation as well."

"Since PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."

"While PDH needs high reaction temperatures in the range of 500–700 °C, reaction pressures are not severe, but near atmospheric pressure."

"Oxychlorination was proposed to increase the mobility of Pt on PDH catalyst. Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C."

"Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction"

"Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C. After oxychlorination reaction, hydrogen reduction process was followed."

          The literature provides limited information on halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It primarily focuses on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and briefly mentions oxychlorination as a catalyst regeneration method.

PDH is described as an endothermic reaction (ΔH298 = 129 kJ/mol) that produces propylene and hydrogen. It requires high temperatures (500-700°C) and uses noble metal or heavy metal catalysts to achieve economically viable conversion. The reaction is typically carried out near atmospheric pressure.

Oxychlorination is mentioned as a method to regenerate the catalyst after deactivation, rather than as a primary dehydrogenation method. It involves adding diluted HCl in purified air at 500°C to increase the mobility of Pt on the catalyst surface, followed by a hydrogen reduction process.

The document does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to fully answer the question about various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation or to compare propane's reactivity with other alkanes in these processes.

          文献对选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的卤素辅助方法提供了有限的信息。它主要集中在丙烷脱氢(PDH)，并简要提及了氯氧化作为催化剂再生方法。

PDH被描述为一种吸热反应(ΔH298 = 129 kJ/mol)，产生丙烯和氢气。它需要高温(500-700°C)，并使用贵金属或重金属催化剂来实现经济可行的转化。该反应通常在接近大气压的条件下进行。

氯氧化被提及作为催化剂失活后的再生方法，而不是作为主要的脱氢方法。它涉及在500°C下在纯化空气中添加稀释的HCl，以增加催化剂表面Pt的移动性，然后进行氢气还原过程。

该文档没有提供关于卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法的信息。它也没有比较丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷或乙烷的反应活性。

鉴于所提供的信息有限，无法全面回答关于丙烷脱氢的各种卤素辅助方法的问题，也无法比较丙烷在这些过程中与其他烷烃的反应活性。
