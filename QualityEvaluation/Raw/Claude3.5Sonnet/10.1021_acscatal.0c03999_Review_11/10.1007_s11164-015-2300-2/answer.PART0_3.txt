[1] "Since PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."

[2] "While PDH needs high reaction temperatures in the range of 500–700 °C, reaction pressures are not severe, but near atmospheric pressure."

[3] "Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction"

[4] "Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C. After oxychlorination reaction, hydrogen reduction process was followed."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation. It primarily focuses on the oxychlorination process for catalyst regeneration in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

The document mentions that PDH is typically carried out at high temperatures (500-700°C) and near atmospheric pressure using noble metal or heavy metal catalysts. It describes an oxychlorination process used for catalyst regeneration, which involves HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500°C, followed by hydrogen reduction.

The literature does not discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

Given the limited information provided, a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on this document.

该文献并未提供丙烷脱氢的各种卤素辅助方法的全面比较。它主要集中在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中催化剂再生的氧氯化过程。

文档提到PDH通常在高温(500-700°C)和接近大气压的条件下进行，使用贵金属或重金属催化剂。它描述了一种用于催化剂再生的氧氯化过程，该过程涉及在500°C下在纯化空气中添加稀释的HCl，然后进行氢气还原。

该文献没有讨论卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。它也没有比较丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷或乙烷的不同。

鉴于提供的信息有限，仅根据这份文件无法对丙烷脱氢的各种卤素辅助方法进行全面比较。
