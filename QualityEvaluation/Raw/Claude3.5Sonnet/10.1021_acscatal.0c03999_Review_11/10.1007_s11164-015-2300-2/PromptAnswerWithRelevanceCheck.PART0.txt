Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

<quotes>

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can produce propylene. Propane dehydrogenation reaction is shown in (Eq. 1) [1, 2]."

[2] "C3H8 ⇌ C3H6 + H2, ΔH298 = 129 kJ/mol"

[3] "PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."

[4] "PDH at higher temperatures may increase the propylene yield, however, also leads to unfavorable side reactions and accelerates catalyst deactivation as well."

[5] "Oxychlorination was proposed to increase the mobility of Pt on PDH catalyst. Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It only discusses propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and briefly mentions oxychlorination as a regeneration method for the catalyst.

The document describes propane dehydrogenation as an endothermic reaction that produces propylene and hydrogen. It requires high temperatures (500-700°C) and uses noble metal or heavy metal catalysts to achieve economically viable conversion. The reaction is typically carried out near atmospheric pressure.

The literature mentions oxychlorination as a method to regenerate the catalyst after deactivation, rather than as a primary dehydrogenation method. Oxychlorination involves adding diluted HCl in purified air at 500°C to increase the mobility of Pt on the catalyst surface.

The document does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to fully answer the question about various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation or to compare propane's reactivity with other alkanes in these processes.

文献并未提供关于各种卤素辅助选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的综合信息。它仅讨论了丙烷脱氢(PDH)，并简要提及了氯氧化作为催化剂的再生方法。

文档描述丙烷脱氢是一种吸热反应，产生丙烯和氢气。它需要高温(500-700°C)，并使用贵金属或重金属催化剂来实现经济可行的转化。该反应通常在接近大气压的条件下进行。

文献提到氯氧化作为催化剂失活后的再生方法，而不是作为主要的脱氢方法。氯氧化涉及在500°C下在纯化空气中添加稀释的HCl，以增加催化剂表面Pt的移动性。

该文档没有提供关于卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法的信息。它也没有比较丙烷在这些过程中与甲烷或乙烷的反应活性。

鉴于所提供的信息有限，无法全面回答关于丙烷脱氢的各种卤素辅助方法的问题，也无法比较丙烷在这些过程中与其他烷烃的反应活性。

The given literature does not contain information about various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. The document focuses on the regeneration of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, particularly using oxychlorination treatment. It does not discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. The literature also does not provide comparative information on the reactivity of propane versus other alkanes like methane and ethane in these processes. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.

[1] "Since PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."

[2] "While PDH needs high reaction temperatures in the range of 500–700 °C, reaction pressures are not severe, but near atmospheric pressure."

[3] "Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction"

[4] "Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C. After oxychlorination reaction, hydrogen reduction process was followed."
