[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "The single-pass propylene yields obtained in both types of experiments are 64%, at 500 C and propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm."

[3] "To examine the role of gas-phase iodine we performed two experiments: in one, propane reacted with oxygen in the absence of iodine; and in the other, propane reacted with a mixture of oxygen and iodine."

[4] "When oxygen is present, the reaction 2HI + 1/2O2 → I2 + H2O is very fast [33]. Because of this both HI and O2 are rapidly consumed: HI is prevented from reacting with propylene and oxygen is prevented from reacting with the hydrocarbons."

[5] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[6] "It appears that at 400 C the presence of oxygen in the gas and of LiI/LiOH in the melt and the addition of I2 to the gaseous feed lead to the highest propylene yield."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase iodine-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction is typically carried out at 500°C with a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm, yielding 64% propylene.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation without halogen: Propane reacts with oxygen alone, but yields are lower compared to halogen-mediated processes.

3. Molten metal halide salt approach: Propane and oxygen are flowed over a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH. The molten salt acts as a source of I2, which then catalyzes the reaction in the gas phase.

4. Combined approach: The highest propylene yields are achieved at 400°C when oxygen is present in the gas, LiI/LiOH is used as the molten salt, and I2 is added to the gaseous feed.

The key to the high selectivity in these processes is the rapid reaction between HI (formed during the reaction) and O2. This prevents oxygen from oxidizing the hydrocarbons and stops HI from reacting with propylene or propyl iodide intermediates.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has weaker C-H bonds compared to methane and ethane, making it easier to dehydrogenate. Additionally, the formation of propyl radicals and propyl iodide intermediates in the iodine-mediated process is more favorable for propane than for smaller alkanes. The presence of a secondary carbon in propane also contributes to its higher reactivity in these halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 气相碘介导的氧化脱氢：这种方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应通常在500°C下进行，丙烷分压为0.1 atm，产生64%的丙烯收率。

2. 无卤素氧化脱氢：丙烷仅与氧气反应，但与卤素介导的过程相比，收率较低。

3. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：丙烷和氧气流过熔融LiI和LiOH的混合物。熔融盐作为I2的来源，然后在气相中催化反应。

4. 组合方法：在400°C下，当气体中存在氧气，使用LiI/LiOH作为熔融盐，并在气体进料中添加I2时，可以获得最高的丙烯收率。

这些过程中高选择性的关键在于HI（反应过程中形成）和O2之间的快速反应。这可以防止氧气氧化碳氢化合物，并阻止HI与丙烯或丙基碘中间体反应。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键较弱，更容易脱氢。此外，在碘介导的过程中，丙基自由基和丙基碘中间体的形成对丙烷来说比小分子烷烃更有利。丙烷中存在的仲碳也contributes to its在这些卤素辅助脱氢过程中的更高反应性。
