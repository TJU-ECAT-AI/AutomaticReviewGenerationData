[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[3] "Iodine is an efficient gas-phase catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. High ODH yields to propylene were achieved by using iodine either generated in-situ from LiI or added as a gas to the propane and oxygen feed."

[4] "When molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH is used as a source of I2, the reaction of oxygen with LiI is rapid and produces sufficient I2 so that addition of I2 to the feed does not increase the propylene yield."

[5] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons."

The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction occurs at around 500°C and produces high propylene yields.

2. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH as a source of I2. Propane and oxygen are flowed over the surface of the molten salt, which reacts with oxygen to produce I2 in situ.

3. Halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH): This is a combination of the above two methods, where iodine is either generated in-situ from LiI or added as a gas to the propane and oxygen feed.

The reaction conditions for these methods typically involve temperatures around 500°C, with propane partial pressures of 0.1 atm and oxygen partial pressures of 0.05 atm. The molar ratio of propane to oxygen is usually 1:0.5, corresponding to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O.

The high reactivity of propane in these processes, compared to methane and ethane, can be attributed to several factors:

1. The presence of iodine as a catalyst, which initiates chain reactions leading to the formation of propyl iodide intermediates.

2. The rapid reaction between oxygen and HI, which prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons and the reverse reaction of propyl iodide to propane.

3. The lower C-H bond strength in propane compared to methane and ethane, making it easier to break and form propylene.

4. The formation of more stable secondary radicals in propane compared to primary radicals in methane and ethane.

These factors combined allow for selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with high yields, while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as complete oxidation or cracking.

文献讨论了几种卤素辅助的选择性脱氢方法，将丙烷转化为丙烯：

1. 气相催化氧化脱氢（ODH）：该方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应在约500°C下进行，产生高丙烯收率。

2. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：该方法使用熔融LiI或熔融LiI和LiOH的混合物作为I2的来源。丙烷和氧气流经熔融盐表面，盐与氧气反应原位生成I2。

3. 卤素介导的氧化脱氢（HM-ODH）：这是上述两种方法的结合，其中碘要么从LiI原位生成，要么作为气体添加到丙烷和氧气进料中。

这些方法的反应条件通常涉及约500°C的温度，丙烷分压为0.1 atm，氧气分压为0.05 atm。丙烷与氧气的摩尔比通常为1:0.5，对应于反应C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O的化学计量比。

与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷在这些过程中的高反应活性可归因于几个因素：

1. 碘作为催化剂的存在，它启动链式反应，导致丙基碘中间体的形成。

2. 氧气与HI之间的快速反应，防止了碳氢化合物的氧化和丙基碘向丙烷的逆反应。

3. 与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键强度较低，更容易断裂并形成丙烯。

4. 与甲烷和乙烷中的伯基自由基相比，丙烷中形成的仲基自由基更稳定。

这些因素的结合允许丙烷选择性脱氢生成丙烯，获得高收率，同时最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，如完全氧化或裂解。
