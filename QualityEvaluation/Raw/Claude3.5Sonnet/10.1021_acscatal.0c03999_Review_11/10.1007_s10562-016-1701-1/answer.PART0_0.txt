[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "Halogen-mediated chemistry, in the presence of oxygen, has the potential to improve substantially the conversion of alkanes to alkenes."

[3] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[4] "Oxygen reacts with the molten iodide and produces I2(g)"

[5] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase catalytic dehydrogenation: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction occurs at around 500°C and produces high propylene yields.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This process involves adding oxygen to the feed, which reacts with the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation. This shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic.

3. Halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH): This method uses a halogen (typically iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The halogen reacts with hydrogen to form HX, which is then regenerated by reaction with oxygen.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a mixture of LiI and LiOH. Oxygen reacts with the molten iodide to produce gaseous I2, which then catalyzes the dehydrogenation reaction.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve temperatures around 400-500°C and the presence of oxygen. The high reactivity of propane in these processes compared to methane and ethane is likely due to:

1. The presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane, which are more reactive than primary carbons.
2. The lower C-H bond strength in propane compared to methane and ethane.
3. The ability of propane to form a stable alkene (propene) without breaking C-C bonds.

The key to the high selectivity in these processes is the rapid reaction of oxygen with HI, which prevents direct oxidation of the hydrocarbons and allows for selective dehydrogenation.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯的方法：

1. 气相催化脱氢：该方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应在约500°C下进行，产生高丙烯收率。

2. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：这个过程涉及向进料中添加氧气，氧气与脱氢过程中产生的氢气反应。这使平衡向更高的丙烷转化率方向移动，并使反应变为放热反应。

3. 卤素介导的氧化脱氢（HM-ODH）：这种方法使用卤素（通常是碘）来介导氧化脱氢过程。卤素与氢气反应形成HX，然后通过与氧气的反应再生。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这种方法使用熔融碘化锂（LiI）或LiI和LiOH的混合物。氧气与熔融碘化物反应产生气态I2，然后催化脱氢反应。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及400-500°C左右的温度和氧气的存在。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷在这些过程中的高反应性可能是由于：

1. 丙烷中存在二级碳原子，比一级碳原子更具反应性。
2. 丙烷的C-H键强度比甲烷和乙烷低。
3. 丙烷能够形成稳定的烯烃（丙烯）而不破坏C-C键。

这些过程中高选择性的关键在于氧气与HI的快速反应，这防止了碳氢化合物的直接氧化，并允许选择性脱氢。
