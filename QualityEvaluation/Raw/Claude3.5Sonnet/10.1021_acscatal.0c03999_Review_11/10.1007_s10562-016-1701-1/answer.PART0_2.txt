[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "The single-pass propylene yields obtained in both types of experiments are 64%, at 500 C and propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm."

[3] "To respond to these multiple supply constraints, the industry developed propylene on demand processes whose goal is the production of propylene through the dehydrogenation of propane"

[4] "In principle many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by performing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a process in which oxygen or CO2 are added to the feed, in the hope that with the appropriate catalyst they will react selectively with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction"

[5] "Instead of reacting the hydrogen formed in reaction (1) with oxygen, we react it with a halogen X2"

[6] "This idea was implemented [57] by bringing a mixture of alkane and oxygen in contact with molten LiI. The reaction of LiI with oxygen produced I2, which then reacted, in gas phase, according to the formal scheme (2)(4)."

[7] "By improving our understanding of I2-mediated ODH using molten LiI we have found conditions for which we achieve 80 % propane conversion and 84 % selectivity to propylene, at 500 C."

[8] "Propane is relatively inert towards oxygen at both temperatures, while propylene reacts more rapidly, and iodopropane reacts even more rapidly."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This method involves reacting propane with a halogen (typically iodine) to form propyl halide, which then decomposes to propene and hydrogen halide.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Oxygen or CO2 is added to the feed along with a catalyst to selectively react with the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation, shifting the equilibrium towards propene formation.

3. Oxyhalogenation: This combines elements of halogenation and ODH. Propane reacts with a halogen (usually iodine) in the presence of oxygen. The oxygen regenerates the halogen, making the process catalytic.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: A mixture of propane and oxygen is brought into contact with molten lithium iodide (LiI). The LiI reacts with oxygen to produce I2, which then acts as a gas-phase catalyst for the dehydrogenation reaction.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve temperatures around 500°C and low propane partial pressures (e.g., 0.1 atm). The molten LiI method achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene at 500°C.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive towards dehydrogenation. Additionally, the propyl radical formed during the reaction is more stable than methyl or ethyl radicals, favoring the formation of propene. The presence of halogens, particularly iodine, further enhances this selectivity by forming propyl iodide intermediates that readily decompose to propene.

The literature also notes that propane is relatively inert towards oxygen compared to propene and iodopropane, which contributes to the selectivity of these processes. This difference in reactivity allows for the selective oxidation of hydrogen (or HI) while minimizing direct oxidation of the hydrocarbons.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这种方法涉及丙烷与卤素（通常是碘）反应形成丙基卤化物，然后分解成丙烯和氢卤化物。

2. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：在进料中加入氧气或CO2，并使用催化剂选择性地与脱氢过程中产生的氢气反应，使平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。

3. 氧卤化：这种方法结合了卤化和ODH的元素。丙烷在氧气存在下与卤素（通常是碘）反应。氧气重新生成卤素，使过程成为催化过程。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：将丙烷和氧气的混合物与熔融的碘化锂（LiI）接触。LiI与氧气反应产生I2，然后I2作为气相催化剂参与脱氢反应。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及500°C左右的温度和低丙烷分压（例如0.1 atm）。熔融LiI方法在500°C下实现了80%的丙烷转化率和84%的丙烯选择性。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷在仲碳上的C-H键较弱，使其更容易发生脱氢反应。此外，反应中形成的丙基自由基比甲基或乙基自由基更稳定，有利于丙烯的形成。卤素，特别是碘的存在，通过形成容易分解成丙烯的丙基碘中间体，进一步增强了这种选择性。

文献还指出，与丙烯和碘丙烷相比，丙烷对氧气相对惰性，这有助于这些过程的选择性。这种反应活性的差异允许选择性地氧化氢（或HI），同时最大限度地减少碳氢化合物的直接氧化。
