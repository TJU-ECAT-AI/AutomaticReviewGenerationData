          [1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "The single-pass propylene yields obtained in both types of experiments are 64%, at 500 C and propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm."

[3] "To examine the role of gas-phase iodine we performed two experiments: in one, propane reacted with oxygen in the absence of iodine; and in the other, propane reacted with a mixture of oxygen and iodine."

[4] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[5] "It appears that at 400 C the presence of oxygen in the gas and of LiI/LiOH in the melt and the addition of I2 to the gaseous feed lead to the highest propylene yield."

[6] "Instead of reacting the hydrogen formed in reaction (1) with oxygen, we react it with a halogen X2"

[7] "This idea was implemented [57] by bringing a mixture of alkane and oxygen in contact with molten LiI. The reaction of LiI with oxygen produced I2, which then reacted, in gas phase, according to the formal scheme (2)(4)."

[8] "By improving our understanding of I2-mediated ODH using molten LiI we have found conditions for which we achieve 80 % propane conversion and 84 % selectivity to propylene, at 500 C."

          The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase iodine-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction is typically carried out at 500°C with a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm, yielding 64% propylene.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This process involves adding oxygen to the feed, which reacts with the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation. This shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic.

3. Halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH): This method uses a halogen (typically iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The halogen reacts with hydrogen to form HX, which is then regenerated by reaction with oxygen.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a mixture of LiI and LiOH. Propane and oxygen are flowed over the surface of the molten salt. Oxygen reacts with the molten iodide to produce gaseous I2, which then catalyzes the reaction in the gas phase.

5. Combined approach: The highest propylene yields are achieved at 400°C when oxygen is present in the gas, LiI/LiOH is used as the molten salt, and I2 is added to the gaseous feed.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve temperatures around 400-500°C and the presence of oxygen. The molten LiI method achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene at 500°C.

The key to the high selectivity in these processes is the rapid reaction between HI (formed during the reaction) and O2. This prevents oxygen from oxidizing the hydrocarbons and stops HI from reacting with propylene or propyl iodide intermediates.

          文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 气相碘介导的氧化脱氢：这种方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应通常在500°C下进行，丙烷分压为0.1 atm，产生64%的丙烯收率。

2. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：这个过程涉及向进料中添加氧气，氧气与脱氢过程中产生的氢气反应。这使平衡向更高的丙烷转化率方向移动，并使反应变为放热反应。

3. 卤素介导的氧化脱氢（HM-ODH）：这种方法使用卤素（通常是碘）来介导氧化脱氢过程。卤素与氢气反应形成HX，然后通过与氧气的反应再生。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这种方法使用熔融碘化锂（LiI）或LiI和LiOH的混合物。丙烷和氧气流过熔融盐表面。氧气与熔融碘化物反应产生气态I2，然后在气相中催化反应。

5. 组合方法：在400°C下，当气体中存在氧气，使用LiI/LiOH作为熔融盐，并在气体进料中添加I2时，可以获得最高的丙烯收率。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及400-500°C左右的温度和氧气的存在。熔融LiI方法在500°C下实现了80%的丙烷转化率和84%的丙烯选择性。

这些过程中高选择性的关键在于HI（反应过程中形成）和O2之间的快速反应。这可以防止氧气氧化碳氢化合物，并阻止HI与丙烯或丙基碘中间体反应。

          [1] "Propane is relatively inert towards oxygen at both temperatures, while propylene reacts more rapidly, and iodopropane reacts even more rapidly."

[2] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons."

[3] "When oxygen is present, the reaction 2HI + 1/2O2 → I2 + H2O is very fast [33]. Because of this both HI and O2 are rapidly consumed: HI is prevented from reacting with propylene and oxygen is prevented from reacting with the hydrocarbons."

          Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to several factors:

1. Molecular structure: Propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive towards dehydrogenation compared to methane and ethane.

2. Radical stability: The propyl radical formed during the reaction is more stable than methyl or ethyl radicals, favoring the formation of propene.

3. Halogen interaction: The presence of halogens, particularly iodine, enhances selectivity by forming propyl iodide intermediates that readily decompose to propene. This effect is more pronounced for propane than for smaller alkanes.

4. Oxygen reactivity: Propane is relatively inert towards oxygen compared to propene and iodopropane. This difference in reactivity allows for the selective oxidation of hydrogen (or HI) while minimizing direct oxidation of the hydrocarbons.

5. HI reaction rate: The high rate of reaction between oxygen and HI is a key factor in the high propylene yield. This rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons, which is particularly important for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Equilibrium shift: The presence of oxygen shifts the equilibrium towards propene formation more effectively for propane than for methane or ethane, due to the more favorable thermodynamics of propane dehydrogenation.

These factors combined allow for selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with high yields, while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as complete oxidation or cracking. The differences in reactivity between propane and smaller alkanes (methane and ethane) in these processes are primarily due to the unique molecular structure of propane and its interaction with the halogen-oxygen system.

          丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于几个因素：

1. 分子结构：丙烷在仲碳上的C-H键较弱，使其比甲烷和乙烷更容易发生脱氢反应。

2. 自由基稳定性：反应中形成的丙基自由基比甲基或乙基自由基更稳定，有利于丙烯的形成。

3. 卤素相互作用：卤素，特别是碘的存在，通过形成容易分解成丙烯的丙基碘中间体，增强了选择性。这种效应对丙烷的影响比对小分子烷烃更明显。

4. 氧气反应性：与丙烯和碘丙烷相比，丙烷对氧气相对惰性。这种反应活性的差异允许选择性地氧化氢（或HI），同时最大限度地减少碳氢化合物的直接氧化。

5. HI反应速率：氧气与HI之间的高反应速率是获得高丙烯收率的关键因素。HI对氧气的快速消耗防止了碳氢化合物的氧化，这对丙烷脱氢尤为重要。

6. 平衡移动：氧气的存在使平衡更有效地向丙烯形成方向移动，这种效应对丙烷比对甲烷或乙烷更明显，这是由于丙烷脱氢的热力学更有利。

这些因素的结合允许丙烷选择性脱氢生成丙烯，获得高收率，同时最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，如完全氧化或裂解。丙烷与小分子烷烃（甲烷和乙烷）在这些过程中反应活性的差异主要是由于丙烷独特的分子结构及其与卤素-氧气系统的相互作用。
