[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "Halogen-mediated chemistry, in the presence of oxygen, has the potential to improve substantially the conversion of alkanes to alkenes."

[3] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[4] "Oxygen reacts with the molten iodide and produces I2(g)"

[5] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase catalytic dehydrogenation: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction occurs at around 500°C and produces high propylene yields.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This process involves adding oxygen to the feed, which reacts with the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation. This shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic.

3. Halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH): This method uses a halogen (typically iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The halogen reacts with hydrogen to form HX, which is then regenerated by reaction with oxygen.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a mixture of LiI and LiOH. Oxygen reacts with the molten iodide to produce gaseous I2, which then catalyzes the dehydrogenation reaction.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve temperatures around 400-500°C and the presence of oxygen. The high reactivity of propane in these processes compared to methane and ethane is likely due to:

1. The presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane, which are more reactive than primary carbons.
2. The lower C-H bond strength in propane compared to methane and ethane.
3. The ability of propane to form a stable alkene (propene) without breaking C-C bonds.

The key to the high selectivity in these processes is the rapid reaction of oxygen with HI, which prevents direct oxidation of the hydrocarbons and allows for selective dehydrogenation.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯的方法：

1. 气相催化脱氢：该方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应在约500°C下进行，产生高丙烯收率。

2. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：这个过程涉及向进料中添加氧气，氧气与脱氢过程中产生的氢气反应。这使平衡向更高的丙烷转化率方向移动，并使反应变为放热反应。

3. 卤素介导的氧化脱氢（HM-ODH）：这种方法使用卤素（通常是碘）来介导氧化脱氢过程。卤素与氢气反应形成HX，然后通过与氧气的反应再生。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：这种方法使用熔融碘化锂（LiI）或LiI和LiOH的混合物。氧气与熔融碘化物反应产生气态I2，然后催化脱氢反应。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及400-500°C左右的温度和氧气的存在。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷在这些过程中的高反应性可能是由于：

1. 丙烷中存在二级碳原子，比一级碳原子更具反应性。
2. 丙烷的C-H键强度比甲烷和乙烷低。
3. 丙烷能够形成稳定的烯烃（丙烯）而不破坏C-C键。

这些过程中高选择性的关键在于氧气与HI的快速反应，这防止了碳氢化合物的直接氧化，并允许选择性脱氢。

[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "The single-pass propylene yields obtained in both types of experiments are 64%, at 500 C and propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm."

[3] "To examine the role of gas-phase iodine we performed two experiments: in one, propane reacted with oxygen in the absence of iodine; and in the other, propane reacted with a mixture of oxygen and iodine."

[4] "When oxygen is present, the reaction 2HI + 1/2O2 → I2 + H2O is very fast [33]. Because of this both HI and O2 are rapidly consumed: HI is prevented from reacting with propylene and oxygen is prevented from reacting with the hydrocarbons."

[5] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[6] "It appears that at 400 C the presence of oxygen in the gas and of LiI/LiOH in the melt and the addition of I2 to the gaseous feed lead to the highest propylene yield."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase iodine-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction is typically carried out at 500°C with a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm, yielding 64% propylene.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation without halogen: Propane reacts with oxygen alone, but yields are lower compared to halogen-mediated processes.

3. Molten metal halide salt approach: Propane and oxygen are flowed over a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH. The molten salt acts as a source of I2, which then catalyzes the reaction in the gas phase.

4. Combined approach: The highest propylene yields are achieved at 400°C when oxygen is present in the gas, LiI/LiOH is used as the molten salt, and I2 is added to the gaseous feed.

The key to the high selectivity in these processes is the rapid reaction between HI (formed during the reaction) and O2. This prevents oxygen from oxidizing the hydrocarbons and stops HI from reacting with propylene or propyl iodide intermediates.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has weaker C-H bonds compared to methane and ethane, making it easier to dehydrogenate. Additionally, the formation of propyl radicals and propyl iodide intermediates in the iodine-mediated process is more favorable for propane than for smaller alkanes. The presence of a secondary carbon in propane also contributes to its higher reactivity in these halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 气相碘介导的氧化脱氢：这种方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应通常在500°C下进行，丙烷分压为0.1 atm，产生64%的丙烯收率。

2. 无卤素氧化脱氢：丙烷仅与氧气反应，但与卤素介导的过程相比，收率较低。

3. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：丙烷和氧气流过熔融LiI和LiOH的混合物。熔融盐作为I2的来源，然后在气相中催化反应。

4. 组合方法：在400°C下，当气体中存在氧气，使用LiI/LiOH作为熔融盐，并在气体进料中添加I2时，可以获得最高的丙烯收率。

这些过程中高选择性的关键在于HI（反应过程中形成）和O2之间的快速反应。这可以防止氧气氧化碳氢化合物，并阻止HI与丙烯或丙基碘中间体反应。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键较弱，更容易脱氢。此外，在碘介导的过程中，丙基自由基和丙基碘中间体的形成对丙烷来说比小分子烷烃更有利。丙烷中存在的仲碳也contributes to its在这些卤素辅助脱氢过程中的更高反应性。

[2] "The single-pass propylene yields obtained in both types of experiments are 64%, at 500 C and propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm."

[3] "To respond to these multiple supply constraints, the industry developed propylene on demand processes whose goal is the production of propylene through the dehydrogenation of propane"

[4] "In principle many of these shortcomings can be alleviated by performing oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a process in which oxygen or CO2 are added to the feed, in the hope that with the appropriate catalyst they will react selectively with the hydrogen produced by the dehydrogenation reaction"

[5] "Instead of reacting the hydrogen formed in reaction (1) with oxygen, we react it with a halogen X2"

[6] "This idea was implemented [57] by bringing a mixture of alkane and oxygen in contact with molten LiI. The reaction of LiI with oxygen produced I2, which then reacted, in gas phase, according to the formal scheme (2)(4)."

[7] "By improving our understanding of I2-mediated ODH using molten LiI we have found conditions for which we achieve 80 % propane conversion and 84 % selectivity to propylene, at 500 C."

[8] "Propane is relatively inert towards oxygen at both temperatures, while propylene reacts more rapidly, and iodopropane reacts even more rapidly."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This method involves reacting propane with a halogen (typically iodine) to form propyl halide, which then decomposes to propene and hydrogen halide.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Oxygen or CO2 is added to the feed along with a catalyst to selectively react with the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation, shifting the equilibrium towards propene formation.

3. Oxyhalogenation: This combines elements of halogenation and ODH. Propane reacts with a halogen (usually iodine) in the presence of oxygen. The oxygen regenerates the halogen, making the process catalytic.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: A mixture of propane and oxygen is brought into contact with molten lithium iodide (LiI). The LiI reacts with oxygen to produce I2, which then acts as a gas-phase catalyst for the dehydrogenation reaction.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve temperatures around 500°C and low propane partial pressures (e.g., 0.1 atm). The molten LiI method achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene at 500°C.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive towards dehydrogenation. Additionally, the propyl radical formed during the reaction is more stable than methyl or ethyl radicals, favoring the formation of propene. The presence of halogens, particularly iodine, further enhances this selectivity by forming propyl iodide intermediates that readily decompose to propene.

The literature also notes that propane is relatively inert towards oxygen compared to propene and iodopropane, which contributes to the selectivity of these processes. This difference in reactivity allows for the selective oxidation of hydrogen (or HI) while minimizing direct oxidation of the hydrocarbons.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的方法：

1. 卤素脱氢：这种方法涉及丙烷与卤素（通常是碘）反应形成丙基卤化物，然后分解成丙烯和氢卤化物。

2. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：在进料中加入氧气或CO2，并使用催化剂选择性地与脱氢过程中产生的氢气反应，使平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。

3. 氧卤化：这种方法结合了卤化和ODH的元素。丙烷在氧气存在下与卤素（通常是碘）反应。氧气重新生成卤素，使过程成为催化过程。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：将丙烷和氧气的混合物与熔融的碘化锂（LiI）接触。LiI与氧气反应产生I2，然后I2作为气相催化剂参与脱氢反应。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常涉及500°C左右的温度和低丙烷分压（例如0.1 atm）。熔融LiI方法在500°C下实现了80%的丙烷转化率和84%的丙烯选择性。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其分子结构。丙烷在仲碳上的C-H键较弱，使其更容易发生脱氢反应。此外，反应中形成的丙基自由基比甲基或乙基自由基更稳定，有利于丙烯的形成。卤素，特别是碘的存在，通过形成容易分解成丙烯的丙基碘中间体，进一步增强了这种选择性。

文献还指出，与丙烯和碘丙烷相比，丙烷对氧气相对惰性，这有助于这些过程的选择性。这种反应活性的差异允许选择性地氧化氢（或HI），同时最大限度地减少碳氢化合物的直接氧化。

1. Gas-phase catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction occurs at around 500°C and produces high propylene yields.

2. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses molten LiI or a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH as a source of I2. Propane and oxygen are flowed over the surface of the molten salt, which reacts with oxygen to produce I2 in situ.

3. Halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH): This is a combination of the above two methods, where iodine is either generated in-situ from LiI or added as a gas to the propane and oxygen feed.

The reaction conditions for these methods typically involve temperatures around 500°C, with propane partial pressures of 0.1 atm and oxygen partial pressures of 0.05 atm. The molar ratio of propane to oxygen is usually 1:0.5, corresponding to the stoichiometry of the reaction C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O.

The high reactivity of propane in these processes, compared to methane and ethane, can be attributed to several factors:

1. The presence of iodine as a catalyst, which initiates chain reactions leading to the formation of propyl iodide intermediates.

2. The rapid reaction between oxygen and HI, which prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons and the reverse reaction of propyl iodide to propane.

3. The lower C-H bond strength in propane compared to methane and ethane, making it easier to break and form propylene.

4. The formation of more stable secondary radicals in propane compared to primary radicals in methane and ethane.

These factors combined allow for selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with high yields, while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as complete oxidation or cracking.

1. 气相催化氧化脱氢（ODH）：该方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应在约500°C下进行，产生高丙烯收率。

2. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：该方法使用熔融LiI或熔融LiI和LiOH的混合物作为I2的来源。丙烷和氧气流经熔融盐表面，盐与氧气反应原位生成I2。

3. 卤素介导的氧化脱氢（HM-ODH）：这是上述两种方法的结合，其中碘要么从LiI原位生成，要么作为气体添加到丙烷和氧气进料中。

这些方法的反应条件通常涉及约500°C的温度，丙烷分压为0.1 atm，氧气分压为0.05 atm。丙烷与氧气的摩尔比通常为1:0.5，对应于反应C3H8 + 1/2 O2 → C3H6 + H2O的化学计量比。

与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷在这些过程中的高反应活性可归因于几个因素：

1. 碘作为催化剂的存在，它启动链式反应，导致丙基碘中间体的形成。

2. 氧气与HI之间的快速反应，防止了碳氢化合物的氧化和丙基碘向丙烷的逆反应。

3. 与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键强度较低，更容易断裂并形成丙烯。

4. 与甲烷和乙烷中的伯基自由基相比，丙烷中形成的仲基自由基更稳定。

这些因素的结合允许丙烷选择性脱氢生成丙烯，获得高收率，同时最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，如完全氧化或裂解。

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase catalytic reaction: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction conditions typically involve a temperature of 500°C, a space time of 90 seconds, and a molar ratio of C3H8:O2:I2 = 0.1:0.05:0.05.

2. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method involves flowing propane and oxygen over a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH. The molten salt serves as a source of I2 for the reaction.

3. Combined approach: This method combines the use of molten LiI/LiOH with the addition of I2 to the gaseous feed, along with oxygen and propane. This approach was found to yield the highest propylene production at 400°C.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between propane and other alkanes like methane and ethane in these processes. However, propane's reactivity in these halogen-assisted methods is likely different due to its molecular structure and the ease of breaking C-H bonds compared to smaller alkanes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) approach is mentioned throughout the text, as it is the underlying principle in all these methods. The presence of oxygen shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic.

Oxyhalogenation is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, but it can be considered as part of the overall process where oxygen and halogens (iodine in this case) are used together to facilitate propane dehydrogenation.

These methods differ from traditional dehydrogenation processes by overcoming equilibrium limitations, operating at lower temperatures, and achieving higher single-pass yields. The presence of iodine and oxygen plays a crucial role in improving selectivity and conversion rates compared to other dehydrogenation methods.

1. 气相催化反应：该方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应条件通常包括500°C的温度，90秒的空间时间，以及C3H8:O2:I2 = 0.1:0.05:0.05的摩尔比。

2. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：该方法涉及将丙烷和氧气流过熔融LiI和LiOH的混合物。熔融盐作为反应的I2来源。

3. 组合方法：该方法结合了使用熔融LiI/LiOH和向气相进料中添加I2，同时还有氧气和丙烷。这种方法在400°C时被发现产生最高的丙烯产量。

文献没有直接比较丙烷和其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）在这些过程中的反应性。然而，丙烷在这些卤素辅助方法中的反应性可能不同，这是由于其分子结构和与较小烷烃相比更容易断裂C-H键。

氧化脱氢（ODH）方法在整个文本中都有提到，因为它是所有这些方法的基本原理。氧气的存在使平衡向更高的丙烷转化率移动，并使反应成为放热反应。

文献中没有明确讨论氧卤化，但它可以被视为整个过程的一部分，其中氧气和卤素（在这种情况下是碘）一起用于促进丙烷脱氢。

这些方法与传统的脱氢过程不同，它们克服了平衡限制，在较低的温度下操作，并实现了更高的单程产率。碘和氧气的存在在提高选择性和转化率方面起着至关重要的作用，比其他脱氢方法更有优势。
