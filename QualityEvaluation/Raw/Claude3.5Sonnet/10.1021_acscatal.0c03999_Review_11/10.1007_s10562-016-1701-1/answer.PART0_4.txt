[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "When iodine was present, C3H8:O2:I2 = 0.1:0.05:0.05. In both cases the space time was 90 s, the temperature was 500 C, the total flow was 5 sccm, the total pressure was 1 atm, and the inert gas was Ar"

[3] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[4] "The experiments whose results are presented in Fig. 4 were done in order to determine whether the molten LiI provides a sufficient amount of I2 to the gas."

[5] "It appears that at 400 C the presence of oxygen in the gas and of LiI/LiOH in the melt and the addition of I2 to the gaseous feed lead to the highest propylene yield."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase catalytic reaction: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction conditions typically involve a temperature of 500°C, a space time of 90 seconds, and a molar ratio of C3H8:O2:I2 = 0.1:0.05:0.05.

2. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method involves flowing propane and oxygen over a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH. The molten salt serves as a source of I2 for the reaction.

3. Combined approach: This method combines the use of molten LiI/LiOH with the addition of I2 to the gaseous feed, along with oxygen and propane. This approach was found to yield the highest propylene production at 400°C.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between propane and other alkanes like methane and ethane in these processes. However, propane's reactivity in these halogen-assisted methods is likely different due to its molecular structure and the ease of breaking C-H bonds compared to smaller alkanes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) approach is mentioned throughout the text, as it is the underlying principle in all these methods. The presence of oxygen shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic.

Oxyhalogenation is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, but it can be considered as part of the overall process where oxygen and halogens (iodine in this case) are used together to facilitate propane dehydrogenation.

These methods differ from traditional dehydrogenation processes by overcoming equilibrium limitations, operating at lower temperatures, and achieving higher single-pass yields. The presence of iodine and oxygen plays a crucial role in improving selectivity and conversion rates compared to other dehydrogenation methods.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 气相催化反应：该方法在丙烷和氧气存在的情况下使用气态I2作为催化剂。反应条件通常包括500°C的温度，90秒的空间时间，以及C3H8:O2:I2 = 0.1:0.05:0.05的摩尔比。

2. 熔融金属卤化物盐方法：该方法涉及将丙烷和氧气流过熔融LiI和LiOH的混合物。熔融盐作为反应的I2来源。

3. 组合方法：该方法结合了使用熔融LiI/LiOH和向气相进料中添加I2，同时还有氧气和丙烷。这种方法在400°C时被发现产生最高的丙烯产量。

文献没有直接比较丙烷和其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）在这些过程中的反应性。然而，丙烷在这些卤素辅助方法中的反应性可能不同，这是由于其分子结构和与较小烷烃相比更容易断裂C-H键。

氧化脱氢（ODH）方法在整个文本中都有提到，因为它是所有这些方法的基本原理。氧气的存在使平衡向更高的丙烷转化率移动，并使反应成为放热反应。

文献中没有明确讨论氧卤化，但它可以被视为整个过程的一部分，其中氧气和卤素（在这种情况下是碘）一起用于促进丙烷脱氢。

这些方法与传统的脱氢过程不同，它们克服了平衡限制，在较低的温度下操作，并实现了更高的单程产率。碘和氧气的存在在提高选择性和转化率方面起着至关重要的作用，比其他脱氢方法更有优势。
