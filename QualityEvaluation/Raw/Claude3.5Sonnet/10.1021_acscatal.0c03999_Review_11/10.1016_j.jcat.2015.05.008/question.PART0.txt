A series of pure, nanostructured magnesium oxides prepared by different synthesis techniques that show
different initial, but similar steady-state activity in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) (Schwach
et al., submitted for publication) has been studied by infrared and photoluminescence spectroscopy in
the dehydroxylated state before the reaction and after catalysis. The abundance of structural defects,
in particular mono-atomic steps, on the dehydroxylated MgO surface characterized by a band in the
FTIR spectrum of adsorbed CO at 2146 cm1 and Lewis acid/base pairs probed by co-adsorption of CO
and CH4 correlate with the initial rates of both methane consumption and C2+ hydrocarbon formation.
Infrared spectroscopy evidences strong polarization of CH bonds due to adsorption of methane on dehy-
droxylated MgO surfaces that contain a high number of mono-atomic steps. It is postulated that these
sites effectively promote intermolecular charge transfer between adsorbed methane and weakly
adsorbed oxygen that leads to the dissociation of one CH bond in the methane molecule and simultane-
ous formation of a superoxide species. Heterolytic splitting of CH bonds in the presence of oxygen at the
surface of dehydroxylated MgO already at room temperature has been proven by the appearance of an
EPR signal associated with superoxide species that are located in close vicinity to a proton. With time
on stream, MgO sinters and loses activity. The deactivation process involves the depletion of
mono-atomic steps and the reconstruction of the MgO termination under formation of polar and faceted
surfaces.

1. Introduction
The activation of CH bonds in the chemically rather inert
methane molecule is an academically challenging goal with
prospective industrial significance in view of the demands to make
new resources, such as natural gas, accessible for the manufacture
of base chemicals and intermediates. In a kinetic study [1], we
investigated the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over pure
magnesium oxide involving five differently prepared model cata-
lysts that differ in particular in the nanostructure of the surface.
The performance of dehydroxylated MgO at the beginning of the
reaction (at t = 0) and the kinetics of catalyst deactivation strongly
depend on initial particle morphology and surface texture, whereas
similar catalyst properties are finally approached in the steady
state. The MgO inherent steady-state activity is, however, rather
low [1]. Therefore, it appears desirable to identify the nature of the
highly active surface sites on the surface of freshly dehydroxylated
MgO and to explore options to stabilize this productive state of the
catalyst. Tuning the catalyst performance using rational design
approaches also requires knowledge about the deactivation mech-
anism to decide whether stabilization strategies may have any rea-
sonable prospects.
The kinetic investigation of MgO in OCM (Part I of this work) [1]
implies a dynamic change of the reaction mechanism(s) with time
on stream. Electron microscopy indicates an impact of structural
defects on the surface of MgO on reactivity and evidences signifi-
cant changes in morphology and termination of the primary cata-
lyst particles with time [1]. Hence, the current part of the work
(Part II) is devoted to the characterization of type and relative
abundance of structural defects, that is, coordinatively unsaturated
sites, at the surface of freshly dehydroxylated MgO prepared by
different synthesis techniques. FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed
probe molecules [2,3], photoluminescence, and EPR spectroscopy
[47] have been proven beneficial in the analysis of MgO and have

been applied in the present investigation. The results of the spec-
troscopic analysis will be linked to the kinetic data acquired in
Part I [1].
Based on sound spectroscopic evidence, we postulate that
weakly adsorbed methane and oxygen undergo a concerted reaction
mechanism that involves direct electron transfer from a CH bond of
the methane to the oxygen molecule. The dehydroxylated MgO
surface assists the polarization of the methane molecule by
providing highly specific adsorption sites at mono-atomic steps
and the underlying terrace that facilitates the reaction of methane
with weakly adsorbed oxygen effectively. These sites, however, dis-
appear with time on stream under reaction conditions of oxidative
methanecoupling. Possible mechanisticscenarios in the deactivated
state of MgO under the steady-state conditions will be discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts and chemicals
The present study was performed using the same catalysts that
have been analyzed in the kinetic investigation in Part I [1] includ-
ing commercially available ultra-pure MgO from Alfa Aesar
(C-MgO), hydrothermally treated C-MgO applying ambient pres-
sure (HT-MgO) or elevated pressure using a microwave autoclave
(MW-MgO), MgO prepared by solgel synthesis (SG-MgO), and
MgO prepared by combustion of metallic Mg in air (S-MgO). The
synthesis methods and the microstructural properties of the cata-
lysts determined by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, and
electron microscopy have been described in detail in Part I [1].
The purity of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen (Westfalen AG) used
for the spectroscopic characterization of the catalysts was 99.999%.
Methane and CO used for the FTIR experiments (purity 99.999%)
were delivered by MESSER. Methane-d4 (purity 99.98%) was pur-
chased by Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2. Infrared spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopy was carried out using a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 100 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. The
spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm1 accumulating 64
scans. Self-supported wafers were obtained by pressing the pow-
dered catalysts under a pressure of 123 MPa. The wafers were
transferred into an IR cell that is connected to a vacuum system,
which allows to achieve a residual pressure of ca. 1  105 Pa.
Prior to the adsorption of gases, the catalysts were heated in
2  104 Pa O2 at 1128 K (heating rate 10 K min1) for 3 h. For
low-temperature adsorption experiments, the sample was subse-
quently cooled in vacuum to room temperature. Then, the sample
chamber was charged with 200 Pa partial pressure of He used as a
heat transfer agent and cooled to 77 K with liquid nitrogen. At first,
a background spectrum was recorded in 200 Pa of He by removing
the wafer from the beam. This spectrum serves as a background for
the spectrum of the pure, freshly pretreated catalyst. The adsorp-
tion measurements were performed in the following order: (1)
the addition of CH4 at various pressures up to an equilibrium pres-
sure of 200 Pa CH4 (total pressure 400 Pa CH4 + He); (2) evacuation
at 77 K until the baseline was fully recovered; (3) the addition of
200 Pa He and stepwise adsorption of CO up to partial pressure
of 200 Pa CO (total pressure 400 Pa CO + He); and (4) the subse-
quent adsorption of CH4 up to partial pressure of 200 Pa CH4 (total
pressure 600 Pa CO + CH4 + He). Difference spectra were obtained
through the subtraction of the absorbance spectrum of the catalyst
in 200 Pa He from the absorbance spectrum of the sample in pres-
ence of the gases. All presented spectra have been normalized to
the post-measurement areal density of the sample wafer.
2.3. EPR spectroscopy
Continuous wave (C.W.) X-band EPR spectra were recorded at
liquid nitrogen temperature on a Bruker ESP 300 E spectrometer
equipped with a X-band microwave bridge Bruker ER 042 MRH
E. A Bruker ER 4116 DM resonator operating in the TE 102 mode
(f  9.5 GHz) was used. The spectra were recorded with a modula-
tion frequency of 100 kHz and a microwave power of 2 mW. The
frequency and g values were calibrated using the
52Cr line at
g = 1.9796 of Cr3+-doped MgO as internal standard placed inside
the resonator. The catalyst samples were filled in a quartz cell
equipped with Teflon Duran valves and connected to a vacuum
system that allows the dosing of gases. Before EPR measurements,
the MgO catalysts were activated at 1073 K under dynamic
vacuum (104105 Pa) for 3 h. Methane (p = 1  104 Pa) and oxygen
(p = 1000 Pa) were subsequently dosed at room temperature, and
the system was equilibrated under these conditions for 30 min.
Then, the cell was evacuated, the Teflon Duran
valves were closed,
and the evacuated cell was put into the EPR resonator equipped
with a quartz Dewar vessel containing liquid N2 to cool the sample
to 77 K and to perform the EPR measurement. EPR spectra were
simulated using the Matlab implementation EasySpin [8] in order
to obtain a best fit for g-tensors and hyperfine coupling constants.
2.4. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
The in situ UVVis experiments were performed in the range
between 200 and 800 nm using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 650 spec-
trometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory (Praying
Mantis, Harrick). The catalysts were investigated in powdered form
in an environmental chamber attachment (Harrick HVC-VUV-4)
using Spectralon as white standard. In this chamber, the catalysts
were pretreated in situ at 923 K for 30 min under vacuum (lower
than 1  103 Pa). Subsequently, the chamber was cooled in
dynamic vacuum, and the spectra were recorded at 313 K.
2.5. Electron microscopy
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
images were recorded on a Cs-corrected FEI Titan 80-300 at an
acceleration voltage of 300 kV.
2.6. Photoluminescence
Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer
LS-55 spectrometer at room temperature under dynamic vacuum
at a pressure lower than 5  104 Pa. The spectrometer was
equipped
with
a
red-sensitive
photomultiplier
R928
from
Hamamatsu Photonics that allows the detection of emissions in
the range between 200 and 900 nm. The spectra were recorded with
an emission and excitation slit opening of 2.5 nm, a scanning speed
of 20 nm/min, and an emission filter of 350 nm in order to suppress
direct light scattering from excitation. The catalyst powder was
located in a flat SUPRASIL quartz cell from Hellma-Analytics with
a path length of 2 mm. The cell was connected to a vacuum and
gas dosing line. Before measurement, the catalysts were heated at
1073 K in a dynamic vacuum for 6 h. Before catalytic testing, the
materials were measured as powder, while the used catalysts were
pressed into pellets of the size of the photoluminescence cell.
3. Results
The magnesium oxide catalysts studied in oxidative coupling of
methane in Part I differ in their morphology [1]. The trend in speci-
fic surface area is not directly related to the mean crystallite size

determined by XRD indicating that surface texturing contributes
substantially to the surface area measured by nitrogen adsorption.
However, sintering phenomena are observed for all catalysts after
use in the oxidative coupling of methane at 1073 K for approxi-
mately 300 h time on stream. The domain size determined by
XRD increases substantially except in the case of S-MgO that shows
a slight size reduction in the initially very large particles [1]. In
agreement with a similar size of the coherently scattering domains
in the used catalysts, the specific surface area of all the used cata-
lysts is similar and varies between 7 and 12 m2/g. Sintering is also
visible by TEM and SEM [1]. After catalysis, the morphology of the
primary particles is much more rounded. The characteristic sharp
edges and corners of the cubic structure have disappeared, and
pseudo {110} and {111} faces consisting of stepped edges
between {100} planes and numerous corners have formed. The
sintering is accompanied by catalyst deactivation. With the aim
to learn more about potential active sites on the surface of fresh,
dehydroxylated MgO, and their depletion under reaction condi-
tions, transmission infrared spectroscopy was used. CO adsorption
at 77 K provides information on coordinatively unsaturated Mg2+
adsorption sites (Lewis acid sites), while adsorption of methane
probes
both
acidic
(cationic)
and
basic
(anionic)
sites.
Co-adsorption of methane and carbon monoxide reveals the rela-
tive abundance of acidbase and basic sites.
3.1. IR spectroscopy
3.1.1. Calcined MgO
3.1.1.1. CO adsorption. The adsorption of carbon monoxide at low
temperatures results in the appearance of carbonyl bands that
are shifted to higher energy compared to the CO stretching mode
of the free CO molecule at 2143 cm1 due to the formation of
r-donor bonds via the carbon atom of the CO molecule to coordi-
natively unsaturated surface cations [9]. The shift to higher wave
number is a result of the Stark effect associated with the positive
electric field of the adsorptive cation. When no d-electrons are
involved, the shift is proportional to the strength of the electric
field sensed by CO [10,11]. As a reasonable first approximation,
the effective electric field experienced by CO adsorbed on a catio-
nic site is a result of the contribution of the cation and the anions of
the first coordination sphere. Thus, when the number of anions
surrounding a Mg2+ adsorption site decreases, the negative contri-
bution to the electric field decreases and, hence, the effective
positive field experienced by the adsorbed CO increases.
Bands arising below 2000 cm1 are attributed to carbonite
anions or similar polymeric structures reflecting the strong basic
character of the MgO surface [12,13]. These species are formed
by interaction of the CO molecule with coordinatively unsaturated
oxygen ions [12].
Fig. 1 exemplarily presents infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on
C-MgO at 77 K and shows the development of C@O stretching
bands as a function of increasing CO pressure. At this low adsorp-
tion temperature, only negligible traces of carbonite species were
observed (Fig. 1A). In the following, the spectra are, therefore, pre-
sented and analyzed exclusively in the range between 2100 and
2200 cm1. At low pressures, that is, up to ca. 7 Pa, a broad feature
due to superimposed contributions of bands at 2146, 2157, and
2164 cm1 is discernible (Fig. 1B). With increasing equilibrium
pressure of CO, the bands at 2146 cm1 and 2164 cm1 are more
and more obscured by the most intense band that shifts from
2157 cm1 to 2152 cm1. Spoto et al. [2] discussed two sets of
bands located at 21502145 cm1 and 21802160 cm1, respec-
tively, formed upon the adsorption of CO on the MgO surface at
60 K. The 21502145 cm1 bands exhibit a maximum located at
ca. 2150 cm1 with a shoulder at 2140 cm1, which are similar to
the features observed at 2156 and 2146 cm1 in Fig. 1B. Such
signals are reported to be strongly attenuated as the MgO crystals
become more ordered and are found to be completely absent from
spectra of nearly perfect well-ordered MgO cubelets prepared by
combustion of metallic Mg (smoke synthesis) [2]. The signal
located at 2146 cm1 is assigned to a CO species bonded to
Mg2+
4CMg2+
5C pairs at mono-atomic step edges, either through both
the carbon end coordinated to a Mg2+
4C site at the edge and the oxygen
end coordinated to a Mg2+
5C site located at the subjacent terrace or
through the carbon end only as bridged species [2]. Computational
studies indicate that CO coordination via carbon only in form of a
bridged complex is more likely [14]. Trionfetti et al. observed this
band also after CO adsorption on Li/MgO catalysts, but with increas-
ing Li content, the contribution of the step sites decreases [15],
which is in agreement of the ironing effect of alkali additives [16].
The band located at 21572152 cm1 has been assigned to Mg2+
5C
on (100) terrace sites [2]. Note that the feature observed at ca.
2146 cm1 in Fig. 1B is swallowed up and finally completely
obscured by the band associated with terrace sites located at
2152 cm1 at higher equilibrium pressures. This observation is con-
sistent with the findings of Spoto et al. [2] who argued that CO is
adsorbed to pairs of Mg2+ cations at low pressures in bridged config-
uration, while at higher pressure, this configuration is displaced by a
1:1 ratio between Mg2+ centers and adsorbed CO. Features located in
the range between 2180 and 2160 cm1 are typically assigned to
terminal CO adsorbed on Mg2+
4C centers [2,15], which occur at the

vibrations. (B) Evolution of carbonyl bands as a function of the CO equilibrium

surface as edges of either mono-atomic or multi-atomic steps,
respectively. We therefore assign the band located at 2164 cm1 in
Fig. 1B to CO adsorbed on edge sites. Spoto et al. reported a band
located at 22052200 cm1 at low CO pressure that shows a red shift
toward 2185 cm1 at higher CO pressure [2]. They tentatively
assigned this band to CO adsorbed on Mg2+
3C species (corners). A
shoulder around 2185 cm1 was detected with all MgO catalysts;
however, the band at 2202 cm1 was observed only for C-, SG-,
and MW-MgO (e.g., see inset in Fig. 1B).
In summary, the spectra presented in Fig. 1 are consistent with
the nanostructured MgO that exposes coordinatively unsaturated
Mg2+ sites in fivefold, fourfold, and threefold coordinations at the
surface. The fourfold-coordinated Mg cations comprise edges at
mono-atomic as well as multi-atomic steps.
Fig. 2 presents CO adsorption isotherms determined by plotting
the integrated area of the entire mCO band as a function of the CO
equilibrium pressure at 77 K. The differences in the maximum
integrated area reflect both the surface area and surface nanostruc-
ture of the differently prepared MgO catalysts. Assuming that the
knee in each isotherm (Fig. 2A) corresponds to monolayer cover-
age, that is, h = 1, the y-axis on each isotherm may be replaced by
surface coverage, h (Fig. 2B). In this manner, the equilibrium pres-
sure of CO required to achieve a specific surface coverage was
determined. Since, as established by Fig. 1B, the coordination of
adsorbed CO is dependent on surface coverage, this procedure
allows a more reliable comparison of the differently prepared
MgO catalysts.
In Fig. 3, the spectra of the adsorbed CO at h = 0.15 are com-
pared for all catalysts. At such a low coverage, we expect that
coupling effects between neighboring CO molecules are negligible.
The difference in the total peak area follows the trend of the speci-
fic surface area (for specific surface areas determined by nitrogen
adsorption at 77 K see the numbers in brackets in the legend of
Fig. 3). For example, S-MgO exhibits the lowest total integrated
intensity and has the lowest surface area of only 11 m2/g, whereas
MW-MgO, which exhibits the largest intensity, has the highest sur-
face area of 111 m2/g indicating that the overall intensity is not
strongly affected by the relative abundance of different Mg2+ sites
exposed at the catalyst surface, that is, the extinction coefficients
of CO adsorbed on different Mg2+ sites seem to be similar.
The MgO catalyst prepared by smoke synthesis, S-MgO, exhibits
the simplest spectrum, which is dominated by a signal at
2156 cm1 that is associated with Mg2+
5C terrace sites. A weak shoul-
der located at 2164 cm1 is attributed to Mg2+
4C centers located at
cubelet edges and/or multi-atomic step defects. The spectrum of
CO adsorbed on C-MgO exhibits generally higher intensity and is
dominated by terrace sites (2156 cm1); however, the relative con-
tribution
of
features
associated
with
mono-atomic
steps
(2146 cm1) is enhanced compared to S-MgO. Solgel prepared
MgO, SG-MgO, exhibits more terrace sites and mono-atomic steps,
while
the
contribution
from
edges
at
multi-atomic
steps
(2164 cm1) is similar to that of C-MgO. Hydrothermally treated
MgO, HT-MgO, features a major contribution from terrace sites
(2156 cm1) with a visible shoulder located at 2164 cm1 due to
edge sites at multi-atomic step defects. The contribution from
mono-atomic step defects is reduced relative to both C-MgO and
SG-MgO.
Finally,
MgO
prepared
by
hydrothermal
microwave
post-treatment, MW-MgO, exhibits a rather broad band with a max-
imum located at 2156 cm1 indicating the predominance of terrace
sites. However, due to the width of the band, the presence of signals
associated with edge sites and mono-atomic step defects cannot be
excluded. Indeed, inspection of the associated TEM image of
MW-MgO (Fig. 4) indicates that edge sites and mono-atomic steps
are indeed present.
In summary, the differently prepared and freshly calcined
magnesium oxides differ in the total concentration of coordinatively
unsaturated Mg2+ surface sites at the surface. The total number of
cationic sites probed by CO adsorption at h = 0.15 displays the same
trend as the total surface area determined by nitrogen adsorption.
More importantly, the relative abundance of the different types of
sites differs. S-MgO, for instance, shows no mono-atomic steps,
while the concentration of the latter seems to be the highest on
MW-MgO.

3.1.1.2. Methane adsorption. The IR spectrum of the free CH4 mole-
cule is characterized by the triply degenerate antisymmetric
stretching mode m3 at 3020 cm1 and the twofold degenerate
HCH deformation mode m4 at 1306 cm1 [1719]. The infrared
spectrum of CH4 adsorbed at 77 K on C-MgO (Fig. 5, red line) shows
bands at 3003, 2896, and 2827 cm1 in the region of CH stretch-
ing vibrations and a band at 1304 cm1 in the region of deforma-
tion vibrations. The shift of 17 cm1 compared to the gas phase
m3 mode and the appearance of a band at 2896 cm1 due to the
infrared-forbidden m1 stretching vibration (Raman band of the free
molecule at 2914 cm1) [17] indicate that the methane is consider-
ably polarized upon adsorption, which goes along with a reduction
of the Td symmetry of the molecule. However, the m4 deformation
mode located at 1304 cm1 is practically not shifted with respect
to gas phase CH4. The m2 mode (Raman band of the free molecule
at
1526 cm1)
remains
IR
inactive.
The
band
located
at
2827 cm1 (Fig. 5) may be assigned to a combination mode of m4
and m2. The observed bands are attributed to methane interacting
with coordinatively unsaturated sites at the surface of C-MgO.
Methane adsorption on regular {100} MgO terrace sites has been
excluded based on theoretical and experimental studies [17]. It is
generally assumed that methane adsorbs on MgO in either mon-
odentate
coordination
on
basic
Lewis
sites
(coordinatively
unsaturated O2 at corners only) or polydentate coordination on
Mg2+O2 Lewis acid/base pairs at edges (Scheme 1) [17,18]. DFT
calculations support the hypothesis that methane prefers polyden-
tate coordination at edges [17]. Li et al. observed two m1 CH
stretching modes located at 2900 and 2890 cm1, respectively,
which were attributed to methane strongly adsorbed on two differ-
ent acidbase pairs on the surface of MgO [18]. In their study, they
found only one m3 mode, which shows a considerable redshift to
3000 cm1, that was attributed to the adsorption on acidbase
pairs. Furthermore, methane weakly adsorbed on coordinatively
unsaturated oxygen anions at corners was assumed to result in a
smaller redshift of the m3 mode to about 3008 cm1 without signif-
icant reduction of the symmetry of the molecule and, conse-
quently, the absence of the IR-forbidden m1 mode [18]. We
noticed that for the MgO catalysts considered here, a band at
2890 cm1 was not observed unless a high pressure (ca. >700 Pa)
of CH4 was admitted. At such equilibrium pressures, signals associ-
ated with gas phase CH4 are already significant indicating that the
corresponding
surface
species
is
rather
weakly
adsorbed.
Irrespective of the conflicting assignments in the literature, broad-
ness and shape of the observed m3 and m1 CH stretching bands
indicate that various different coordination complexes of adsorbed
methane are present on the surface of C-MgO. This deduction is
entirely consistent with the different Mg2+ environments revealed
by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO (Figs. 1 and 3).

The spectrum of adsorbed methane shows additional bands in
the region of OH stretching vibrations at 3728, 3680, and
3660 cm1 (Fig. 5, red line). The wave numbers are characteristic
of MgOH species in different coordination [20]. Interestingly,
these bands that have to the best of our knowledge not yet been
reported in the literature for methane adsorption on MgO disap-
pear along with the other methane bands upon evacuation at
77 K (Supporting information, Fig. S1). This indicates that they
are due to a very weakly bound surface species. The mOH signal
could be caused by dissociative adsorption of methane, whereby
new hydroxy and methyl groups are formed on neighboring O2
and Mg2+ sites, respectively. However, the fact that the signals
were completely removed by evacuation at 77 K (Fig. S1) renders
this explanation rather unlikely. Therefore, these features are ten-
tatively assigned to hydrogen-bonded moieties (MgO  HCH3)
present in dihapto methane adsorption complexes. Apparently,
adsorption sites on MgO are capable of polarizing the CH bonds
in such a way that not only the IR inactive vibrations of CH4, but
also discrete mOH signals due to hydrogen atoms of methane, which
interact with O2 sites at the MgO surface, become visible. The
interaction geometry of methane with acidbase pair sites pro-
posed by Li et al. [18] certainly implies an agostic interaction
between CH and the acidbase pair, which could then lead to a
polarization of the adsorbed methane possibly resulting in an
enhanced interaction between the neighboring basic O2 and the
methyl hydrogen. The fact that the MgO  HCH3 features are
not observed in the co-adsorption experiments, where Mg2+ cen-
ters are saturated by CO (Fig. 5, black line), indicates that they must
be associated with acidbase pair sites only, because CO blocks
these sites (Scheme 1 and discussion below).

<questions>


Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
