[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[3] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction"

[4] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using sulfur dioxide (SO2) over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst.

The study describes an oxidative dehydrogenation process using SO2 as an oxidizing agent. The reaction conditions include:
- Catalyst: 0.5% Pd/Al2O3
- Temperature range: 552-618°C
- Atmospheric pressure
- Space velocity: 600 hr-1

The addition of SO2 to the propane feed increased propane conversion but decreased selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed. The proposed mechanism involves SO2 abstracting hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.

The document does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

The study concludes that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in propane dehydrogenation, but further research is needed to improve selectivity to propylene.

文献并未提供各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的全面比较。它主要关注使用二氧化硫（SO2）在Pd/Al2O3催化剂上进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。

研究描述了一种使用SO2作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢过程。反应条件包括：
- 催化剂：0.5% Pd/Al2O3
- 温度范围：552-618°C
- 大气压
- 空速：600 hr-1

向丙烷进料中添加SO2增加了丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，降低了丙烯的选择性。提出的机理涉及SO2从丙烷中提取氢，形成硫化氢和水作为副产品。

该文档未提供有关卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法的信息。它也没有比较丙烷与甲烷或乙烷在这些过程中的反应活性。

研究得出结论，使用SO2进行氧化脱氢提供了一种克服丙烷脱氢平衡限制的替代方法，但需要进一步研究以提高丙烯的选择性。
