[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[3] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."

[4] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It only discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using sulfur dioxide (SO2) over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst.

The document describes an oxidative dehydrogenation process using SO2 as an oxidizing agent. The reaction conditions include:
- Catalyst: 0.5% Pd/Al2O3
- Temperature range: 552-618°C
- Atmospheric pressure
- Space velocity: 600 hr-1

The addition of SO2 to the propane feed increases propane conversion but decreases selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed. The proposed mechanism involves SO2 abstracting hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.

The literature does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

The study concludes that oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 offers an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in propane dehydrogenation, with Pd/Al2O3 showing promise as a catalyst for this process.

该文献并未提供各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的全面比较。它仅讨论了在Pd/Al2O3催化剂上使用二氧化硫(SO2)进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。

文献描述了一个使用SO2作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢过程。反应条件包括：
- 催化剂：0.5% Pd/Al2O3
- 温度范围：552-618°C
- 大气压
- 空速：600 hr-1

向丙烷进料中添加SO2会增加丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，会降低对丙烯的选择性。提出的机理涉及SO2从丙烷中提取氢，形成硫化氢和水作为副产品。

文献没有提供关于卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法的信息。它也没有比较丙烷与甲烷或乙烷在这些过程中的反应活性。

研究得出结论，使用SO2进行氧化脱氢为克服丙烷脱氢的平衡限制提供了一种替代方法，Pd/Al2O3作为这一过程的催化剂显示出了前景。
