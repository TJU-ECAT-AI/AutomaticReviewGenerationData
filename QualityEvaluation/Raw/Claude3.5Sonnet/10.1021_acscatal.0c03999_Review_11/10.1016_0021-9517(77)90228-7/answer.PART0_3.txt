[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."

[3] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

[4] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It only discusses the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidative dehydrogenation agent for propane over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst.

The study shows that adding SO2 to the propane feed increases propane conversion but decreases selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed. The reaction involves SO2 abstracting hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water. However, the low selectivity to propylene is attributed to its further oxidation by SO2 to form water and carbon dioxide.

The document does not discuss dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not provide information on reaction conditions for these methods or compare propane's reactivity to that of methane and ethane in these processes.

Given the limited scope of the study, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question based solely on the information presented in this literature.

该文献并未提供各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的全面比较。它只讨论了在Pd/Al2O3催化剂上使用二氧化硫(SO2)作为氧化脱氢剂处理丙烷的方法。

研究表明,与纯丙烷进料相比,向丙烷进料中添加SO2可以提高丙烷转化率,但会降低对丙烯的选择性。反应涉及SO2从丙烷中抽取氢,形成硫化氢和水。然而,对丙烯的低选择性被归因于丙烯被SO2进一步氧化形成水和二氧化碳。

该文档未讨论卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。它也没有提供这些方法的反应条件信息,或比较丙烷与甲烷和乙烷在这些过程中的反应活性。

鉴于研究范围有限,仅根据本文献中提供的信息无法对该问题给出全面的回答。
