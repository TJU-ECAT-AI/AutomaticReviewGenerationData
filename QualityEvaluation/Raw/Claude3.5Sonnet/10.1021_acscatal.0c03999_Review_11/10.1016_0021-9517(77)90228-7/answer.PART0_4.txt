[1] "The present work is an investigation of the system propane-sulfur dioxide over Id/A1203 catalyst in the reduced and sulfided states."

[2] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[3] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[4] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."

The document does not provide detailed information about various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It only discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using sulfur dioxide over a palladium/alumina catalyst. The study does not mention dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches.

The document describes an oxidative dehydrogenation process using SO2 as the oxidizing agent over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. The reaction conditions include temperatures ranging from 552°C to 618°C, atmospheric pressure, and a space velocity of 600 hr-1. The addition of SO2 to the propane feed increased propane conversion but decreased selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

The study does not provide information on the reactivity differences between propane and other alkanes like methane and ethane in these processes. The focus is solely on propane dehydrogenation.

Given the limited scope of the document, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation or to explain the reactivity differences between propane and other alkanes as requested in the question.

该文档并未提供关于各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的详细信息。它仅讨论了在钯/氧化铝催化剂上使用二氧化硫进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。研究没有提及卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。

文档描述了一个使用SO2作为氧化剂在Pd/Al2O3催化剂上进行的氧化脱氢过程。反应条件包括温度范围从552°C到618°C，大气压力，空速为600 hr-1。向丙烷进料中添加SO2增加了丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，降低了丙烯的选择性。

该研究没有提供关于丙烷与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）在这些过程中反应性差异的信息。研究重点仅在于丙烷脱氢。

鉴于文档的范围有限，无法提供各种卤素辅助丙烷脱氢方法的全面比较，也无法解释问题中要求的丙烷与其他烷烃之间的反应性差异。
