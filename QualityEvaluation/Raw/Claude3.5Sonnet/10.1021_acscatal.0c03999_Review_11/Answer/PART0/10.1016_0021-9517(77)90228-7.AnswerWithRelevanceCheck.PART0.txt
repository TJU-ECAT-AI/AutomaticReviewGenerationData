          "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

"The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

"oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."

"SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

"The present work is an investigation of the system propane-sulfur dioxide over Id/A1203 catalyst in the reduced and sulfided states."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene as requested in the question. Instead, it focuses primarily on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using sulfur dioxide (SO2) over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst.

Key findings from the study include:
1. Reaction conditions: 
   - Catalyst: 0.5% Pd/Al2O3
   - Temperature range: 552-618°C
   - Atmospheric pressure
   - Space velocity: 600 hr-1

2. The addition of SO2 to the propane feed increases propane conversion but decreases selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

3. The proposed mechanism involves SO2 abstracting hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 is suggested as an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in propane dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

Given the limited scope of the study, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question based solely on the information presented in this literature.

          文献并未提供问题中要求的各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的全面比较。相反，它主要关注在Pd/Al2O3催化剂上使用二氧化硫（SO2）进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。

研究的主要发现包括：
1. 反应条件：
   - 催化剂：0.5% Pd/Al2O3
   - 温度范围：552-618°C
   - 大气压
   - 空速：600 hr-1

2. 向丙烷进料中添加SO2增加了丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，降低了丙烯的选择性。

3. 提出的机理涉及SO2从丙烷中提取氢，形成硫化氢和水作为副产品。

4. 使用SO2进行氧化脱氢被提出作为克服丙烷脱氢平衡限制的一种替代方法。

该文档未提供有关卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法的信息。它也没有比较丙烷与甲烷或乙烷在这些过程中的反应活性。

鉴于研究范围有限，仅根据本文献中提供的信息无法对该问题给出全面的回答。
