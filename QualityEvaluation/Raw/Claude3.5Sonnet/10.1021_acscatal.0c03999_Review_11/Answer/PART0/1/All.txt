As a C3 molecule, propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive. This allows for lower reaction temperatures in some cases, particularly with the dual halogen process. However, the increased reactivity also makes propane more susceptible to overoxidation in ODH processes, leading to lower yields compared to less reactive alkanes.\n\nThe dual halogen process appears to be the most promising approach, combining the selectivity of iodine with the reactivity of bromine at moderate temperatures.
