The literature provides limited information on halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. It primarily focuses on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and briefly mentions oxychlorination as a catalyst regeneration method.

PDH is described as an endothermic reaction (ΔH298 = 129 kJ/mol) that produces propylene and hydrogen. It requires high temperatures (500-700°C) and uses noble metal or heavy metal catalysts to achieve economically viable conversion. The reaction is typically carried out near atmospheric pressure.

Oxychlorination is mentioned as a method to regenerate the catalyst after deactivation, rather than as a primary dehydrogenation method. It involves adding diluted HCl in purified air at 500°C to increase the mobility of Pt on the catalyst surface, followed by a hydrogen reduction process.

The document does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to fully answer the question about various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation or to compare propane's reactivity with other alkanes in these processes.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene as requested in the question. Instead, it focuses primarily on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using sulfur dioxide (SO2) over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst.

Key findings from the study include:
1. Reaction conditions: 
   - Catalyst: 0.5% Pd/Al2O3
   - Temperature range: 552-618°C
   - Atmospheric pressure
   - Space velocity: 600 hr-1

2. The addition of SO2 to the propane feed increases propane conversion but decreases selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

3. The proposed mechanism involves SO2 abstracting hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 is suggested as an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in propane dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also does not compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

Given the limited scope of the study, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question based solely on the information presented in this literature.

The literature primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide as a catalyst, with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive. This method shows significant improvements in propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to oxidative dehydrogenation without TCM.

Key findings for TCM-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation include:
1. Adding TCM (0.17 kPa) increased propane conversion and C3H6 selectivity across all O2 partial pressures tested.
2. In the absence of O2, TCM alone caused 0.8% propane conversion with 71% selectivity to C3H6.
3. A partial pressure of 0.085 kPa TCM doubled propane conversion and tripled C2+C3 selectivity compared to no TCM.

The reaction conditions typically involve a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure, operated at 723 K. The feed usually consisted of propane, oxygen, and TCM in varying partial pressures, diluted with helium.

The study also mentions that similar benefits were observed for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) on Pr6O11 and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 and Pr6O11 when small partial pressures of TCM were added to the feedstream.

However, the document does not provide detailed information on other halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation, such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches.

Regarding the difference in reactivity between propane and other alkanes, the literature mentions that for methane oxidation on cerium oxide, the addition of TCM had no positive effect, producing only carbon oxides. In contrast, for propane, TCM addition significantly improved both conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that propane's reactivity in these processes differs from that of methane, possibly due to its longer carbon chain and different C-H bond strengths.

The literature does not provide enough information to make a comprehensive comparison of propane's reactivity to that of ethane in these processes.

The various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses halogens directly to remove hydrogen from propane. For example, using Cl2 with a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 400°C achieves 50% propane conversion with 95% propene selectivity.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene. The reaction proceeds through the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretically, it can achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation.

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2): This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450-600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70%.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally occur at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700°C. Specific temperature ranges and catalysts are used for different methods, such as 400°C for halo-dehydrogenation with Ru/TiO2 catalyst and 450-600°C for molten salt approaches.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to differences in the alkanes' structures and bond strengths. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane or ethane, which only have primary carbons. Additionally, the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propene (the product) can lead to successive oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane. These structural differences affect the ease of C-H bond activation, the stability of intermediates formed during the dehydrogenation process, and the overall reaction pathways, leading to different product distributions compared to shorter chain alkanes.

The provided literature does not contain comprehensive information about various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. The document focuses specifically on propane oxychlorination using metal phosphate catalysts, but does not discuss or compare other halogen-assisted dehydrogenation methods, oxidative dehydrogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. 

          However, based on the information provided about propane oxychlorination:

          1. Propane oxychlorination involves the reaction of propane with HCl and O2 to produce propylene.
          2. The reaction typically occurs at temperatures between 673-773 K using metal phosphate catalysts (MPO, where M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu).
          3. The mechanism is believed to proceed mainly via catalytic generation of C3H7Cl and its subsequent dehydrochlorination into C3H6.
          4. The best performing catalyst, CrPO, achieved propylene yields up to 50% at 95% selectivity.
          5. Reactivity and selectivity depend on factors such as the catalyst's ability to evolve chlorine, dehydrochlorination kinetics, and propensity towards cracking and combustion reactions.

          The document suggests that propane's reactivity in oxychlorination differs from simpler alkanes like ethane. Propane and/or propane derivatives are described as much more reactive compared to ethane-derived compounds, making selectivity control more challenging in propane oxychlorination.

          However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of propane's reactivity to other alkanes like methane and ethane across various halogen-assisted dehydrogenation processes. To fully answer the question, additional sources would be needed.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This method, particularly iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes. It involves high-temperature reactions (>673 K) between iodine and propane to produce propene and HI. The reaction follows a radical mechanism and is selective but slow at lower temperatures.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This approach uses iodide-based molten salts as catalysts in the presence of oxygen. It allows for lower reaction temperatures (typically 700-900 K) compared to direct iodination and shifts the equilibrium constraint. However, overoxidation to carbon oxides can lower feedstock utilization.

3. Oxyhalogenation: This process uses bromine and oxygen to convert propane. Vanadium phosphate catalysts are used for propane oxybromination. At low temperatures, it produces mainly ethyl bromide, but propylene selectivity increases rapidly with temperature (typically 750-850 K).

4. Molten metal halide salt approaches: These use metal iodides (e.g., LiI) as catalysts and hydrogen iodide acceptors. The reaction occurs at 700-900 K, with the molten salts helping to manage heat and shift equilibrium.

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation: This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at moderate temperatures below 800 K.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which have only primary carbons. This allows for easier C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Additionally, propane can form more stable intermediate species and undergo dehydrogenation more readily to produce propene. In contrast, methane activation is more challenging due to its strong C-H bonds, while ethane tends to form ethylene or ethyl halides more readily than propene in similar reactions.

The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: Highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive due to iodine costs.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: More reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): Achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K) using low iodine content (≤20%).

4. Traditional propane dehydrogenation: Requires very high temperatures (1000K) due to thermodynamic limitations.

5. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Introduces an oxidant to improve thermodynamics, but yields are limited to about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propene.

Reaction conditions vary significantly among these methods:
- Iodine process: 900K
- Bromine-iodine mixture: <800K
- Traditional dehydrogenation: 1000K
- ODH: Not specified, but likely lower than traditional dehydrogenation

Propane's reactivity differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. As a C3 molecule, propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive. This allows for lower reaction temperatures in some cases, particularly with the dual halogen process. However, the increased reactivity also makes propane more susceptible to overoxidation in ODH processes, leading to lower yields compared to less reactive alkanes.

The dual halogen process appears to be the most promising approach, combining the selectivity of iodine with the reactivity of bromine at moderate temperatures. This method addresses the limitations of using either halogen alone and achieves significantly higher yields than traditional ODH processes.

The literature does not specifically mention oxyhalogenation or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with halogens: This involves directly reacting propane with halogens, especially iodine, at high temperatures to form propene and hydrogen halide. The reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: This method combines the use of halogens (particularly iodine) with oxygen. It is thermodynamically favorable and can achieve 100% conversion when reactions are performed in a single reactor. The overall reaction is C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O.

3. Oxyhalogenation: While not explicitly named, this process integrates halogen-based dehydrogenation with oxygen to regenerate the halogen. Iodine is produced from a lithium iodide salt melt and oxygen, then reacts with propane. Hydrogen iodide is removed by reaction with lithium hydroxide.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt as a reaction medium. Experiments are typically performed with 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600°C, with a propane/air mixture of 1:2.

Reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve:
- High temperatures (around 500-600°C)
- The presence of iodine or iodide salts
- Addition of air or oxygen
- Use of molten salt melts in some approaches
- Specialized reactor designs, such as Shell's patented single-reactor systems with different reaction zones

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure:
1. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon-hydrogen bonds, with the secondary C-H bonds being weaker and more reactive. This allows for easier abstraction of hydrogen atoms.
2. The ability to form both normal and isopropyl radicals leads to different reaction pathways and influences selectivity.
3. The formation of a stable double bond in propene provides a thermodynamic driving force not present in methane dehydrogenation and less favorable for ethane.
4. At high radical concentrations, propane can undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane.

The radical nature of the reaction mechanism and the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals significantly influence the selectivity towards propene. Lower temperatures generally favor higher propene selectivities by suppressing secondary reactions that lead to byproducts like benzene.

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Gas-phase iodine-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation: This method uses gaseous I2 as a catalyst in the presence of propane and oxygen. The reaction is typically carried out at 500°C with a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm, yielding 64% propylene.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This process involves adding oxygen to the feed, which reacts with the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation. This shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic.

3. Halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (HM-ODH): This method uses a halogen (typically iodine) to mediate the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The halogen reacts with hydrogen to form HX, which is then regenerated by reaction with oxygen.

4. Molten metal halide salt approach: This method uses molten lithium iodide (LiI) or a mixture of LiI and LiOH. Propane and oxygen are flowed over the surface of the molten salt. Oxygen reacts with the molten iodide to produce gaseous I2, which then catalyzes the reaction in the gas phase.

5. Combined approach: The highest propylene yields are achieved at 400°C when oxygen is present in the gas, LiI/LiOH is used as the molten salt, and I2 is added to the gaseous feed.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally involve temperatures around 400-500°C and the presence of oxygen. The molten LiI method achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene at 500°C.

The key to the high selectivity in these processes is the rapid reaction between HI (formed during the reaction) and O2. This prevents oxygen from oxidizing the hydrocarbons and stops HI from reacting with propylene or propyl iodide intermediates.
