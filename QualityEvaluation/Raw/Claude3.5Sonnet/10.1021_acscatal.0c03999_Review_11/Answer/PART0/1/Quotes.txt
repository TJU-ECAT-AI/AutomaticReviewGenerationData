"Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can produce propylene. Propane dehydrogenation reaction is shown in (Eq. 1) [1, 2]."

"C3H8 ⇌ C3H6 + H2, ΔH298 = 129 kJ/mol"

"PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."

"PDH at higher temperatures may increase the propylene yield, however, also leads to unfavorable side reactions and accelerates catalyst deactivation as well."

"Since PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring higher temperature, noble metal or heavy metal catalysts are used to achieve economically attractive conversion."

"While PDH needs high reaction temperatures in the range of 500–700 °C, reaction pressures are not severe, but near atmospheric pressure."

"Oxychlorination was proposed to increase the mobility of Pt on PDH catalyst. Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C."

"Among the various regeneration processes, it is noticeable that attractive restoration of catalytic activity and selectivity was achieved by either coke burning/oxychlorination or chloride addition/metals reduction"

"Proposed oxychlorination was performed by HCl addition diluted in purified air at 500 °C. After oxychlorination reaction, hydrogen reduction process was followed."

"The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

"The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

"oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction; Pd/A1,03 offers some hope in this respect."

"SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

"The present work is an investigation of the system propane-sulfur dioxide over Id/A1203 catalyst in the reduced and sulfided states."

"The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the introduction of TCM to the feedstream."

"On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conversion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2, although more substantially at the lower values of the latter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly increased."

"With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."

"The addition of a partial pressure of TCM equal to 0.085 kPa produces a conversion approximately twice that observed in its absence and an increase in the C2 + C3 selectivity by more than a factor of three with concomitant decreases in the selectivities to carbon oxides"

"More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."

"A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."

"Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C."

"The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX."

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15)."

"It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

"C3H6 selectivity during the C3H8 oxidative dehydrogenation is generally lower than that of C2H4 from C2H6 because of the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in the case of C3H6, which can lead to successive oxidation of C3H6."

"Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

"Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts."

"Propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate gave prominent C2H5Br instead of C3H7Br in the low-temperature region, and the propylene selectivity increased rapidly at the compensation of C2H5Br with increasing temperature."

"Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators."

"Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

"A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

"For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

"Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

"Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."

"Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

"Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

"However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

"Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using halogens, especially iodine, has previously been explored by Shell and Petro-Tex"

[2] "If the reactions (1)-(3) are performed in one reactor, the total reaction will be oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction (4)). This reaction is thermodynamically very favourable and 100% conversion is expected."

[3] "Shell [3] has patented two different single-reactor systems, where the reactions (1)-(3) take place in different zones in the reactor, and a solid acceptor capable of binding hydrogen iodide as a halide is circulated in the system."

[4] "The high temperature reaction of propane with iodine to form propene and hydrogen iodide has been investigated earlier. The radical nature of the reactions seems to be well established [4,5]."

[5] "Iodine is produced from a salt melt (lithium iodide) and oxygen. Hydrogen iodide is removed by reaction with lithium hydroxide."

[6] "The reactions are assumed to be:
C3H8 + I2 → C3H6 + 2HI
2HI + 2LiOH → 2LiI + 2H2O
2LiI + 1/2O2 + H2O → 2LiOH + I2
C3H8 + 1/2O2 → C3H6 + H2O"

[7] "In the present work the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is accomplished in the presence of iodine and air."

[8] "Dehydrogenation of propane is performed in 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600C, with a propane/air mixture of 1:2"

[9] "Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations show that low temperatures give higher propene selectivities. The experimental results confirm this and indicate that the reaction proceeds by a radical mechanism."

[10] "A major factor governing propene reactivity is the ratio of normal/isopropyl radicals. At the relatively high radical concentrations encountered in the system, benzene is the ultimate product."

[1] "We studied propylene production by the reaction of propane with oxygen in the presence of gaseous I2 which works as a gas-phase catalyst."

[2] "The single-pass propylene yields obtained in both types of experiments are 64%, at 500 C and propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm."

[3] "To examine the role of gas-phase iodine we performed two experiments: in one, propane reacted with oxygen in the absence of iodine; and in the other, propane reacted with a mixture of oxygen and iodine."

[4] "We carried out HM-ODH by flowing gaseous propane and oxygen (no I2 was present in the gaseous feed) over the surface of a mixture of molten LiI and LiOH."

[5] "It appears that at 400 C the presence of oxygen in the gas and of LiI/LiOH in the melt and the addition of I2 to the gaseous feed lead to the highest propylene yield."

[6] "Instead of reacting the hydrogen formed in reaction (1) with oxygen, we react it with a halogen X2"

[7] "This idea was implemented [57] by bringing a mixture of alkane and oxygen in contact with molten LiI. The reaction of LiI with oxygen produced I2, which then reacted, in gas phase, according to the formal scheme (2)(4)."

[8] "By improving our understanding of I2-mediated ODH using molten LiI we have found conditions for which we achieve 80 % propane conversion and 84 % selectivity to propylene, at 500 C."
