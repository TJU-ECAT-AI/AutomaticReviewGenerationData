          "Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."

"Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

"Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

"However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

"Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

          The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: Highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive due to iodine costs.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: More reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): Achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K) using low iodine content (≤20%).

4. Traditional propane dehydrogenation: Requires very high temperatures (1000K) due to thermodynamic limitations.

5. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Introduces an oxidant to improve thermodynamics, but yields are limited to about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propene.

Reaction conditions vary significantly among these methods:
- Iodine process: 900K
- Bromine-iodine mixture: <800K
- Traditional dehydrogenation: 1000K
- ODH: Not specified, but likely lower than traditional dehydrogenation

Propane's reactivity differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. As a C3 molecule, propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive. This allows for lower reaction temperatures in some cases, particularly with the dual halogen process. However, the increased reactivity also makes propane more susceptible to overoxidation in ODH processes, leading to lower yields compared to less reactive alkanes.

The dual halogen process appears to be the most promising approach, combining the selectivity of iodine with the reactivity of bromine at moderate temperatures. This method addresses the limitations of using either halogen alone and achieves significantly higher yields than traditional ODH processes.

The literature does not specifically mention oxyhalogenation or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

          文献讨论了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 碘基脱氢：高度选择性，但需要很高的温度（900K），由于碘成本高昂而昂贵。

2. 溴基脱氢：比碘更具反应性，但对丙烯和溴丙烷的选择性较低。

3. 双卤素工艺（溴-碘混合物）：在适中温度（<800K）下，使用低含量的碘（≤20%）可实现高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷单程产率。

4. 传统丙烷脱氢：由于热力学限制，需要很高的温度（1000K）。

5. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：引入氧化剂以改善热力学条件，但由于丙烯的连续氧化，产率限制在约30%。

这些方法的反应条件差异显著：
- 碘工艺：900K
- 溴-碘混合物：<800K
- 传统脱氢：1000K
- ODH：未指明，但可能低于传统脱氢

丙烷的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。作为C3分子，丙烷在次级碳原子上的C-H键较弱，使其更具反应性。这在某些情况下允许使用较低的反应温度，特别是在双卤素工艺中。然而，增加的反应性也使丙烷在ODH过程中更容易过度氧化，导致产率低于less反应性烷烃。

双卤素工艺似乎是最有前景的方法，它在适中的温度下结合了碘的选择性和溴的反应性。这种方法解决了单独使用任一卤素的局限性，并实现了显著高于传统ODH过程的产率。

文献没有具体提到丙烷脱氢的氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。
