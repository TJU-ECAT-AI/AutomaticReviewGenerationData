Molecular structure: Propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive towards dehydrogenation compared to methane and ethane.\n\n2. Radical stability: The propyl radical formed during the reaction is more stable than methyl or ethyl radicals, favoring the formation of propene.\n\n3. Halogen interaction: The presence of halogens, particularly iodine, enhances selectivity by forming propyl iodide intermediates that readily decompose to propene. This effect is more pronounced for propane than for smaller alkanes.\n\n4. Oxygen reactivity: Propane is relatively inert towards oxygen compared to propene and iodopropane.
