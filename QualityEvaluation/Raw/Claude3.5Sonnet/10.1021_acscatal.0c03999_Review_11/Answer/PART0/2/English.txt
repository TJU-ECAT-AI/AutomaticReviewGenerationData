Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to several factors:

1. Molecular structure: Propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive towards dehydrogenation compared to methane and ethane.

2. Radical stability: The propyl radical formed during the reaction is more stable than methyl or ethyl radicals, favoring the formation of propene.

3. Halogen interaction: The presence of halogens, particularly iodine, enhances selectivity by forming propyl iodide intermediates that readily decompose to propene. This effect is more pronounced for propane than for smaller alkanes.

4. Oxygen reactivity: Propane is relatively inert towards oxygen compared to propene and iodopropane. This difference in reactivity allows for the selective oxidation of hydrogen (or HI) while minimizing direct oxidation of the hydrocarbons.

5. HI reaction rate: The high rate of reaction between oxygen and HI is a key factor in the high propylene yield. This rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of hydrocarbons, which is particularly important for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Equilibrium shift: The presence of oxygen shifts the equilibrium towards propene formation more effectively for propane than for methane or ethane, due to the more favorable thermodynamics of propane dehydrogenation.

These factors combined allow for selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with high yields, while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as complete oxidation or cracking. The differences in reactivity between propane and smaller alkanes (methane and ethane) in these processes are primarily due to the unique molecular structure of propane and its interaction with the halogen-oxygen system.
