[1] "Propane is relatively inert towards oxygen at both temperatures, while propylene reacts more rapidly, and iodopropane reacts even more rapidly."

[2] "We propose that the high rate of the reaction of oxygen with HI is the main reason for the high propylene yield. Rapid consumption of oxygen by HI prevents the oxidation of the hydrocarbons."

[3] "When oxygen is present, the reaction 2HI + 1/2O2 → I2 + H2O is very fast [33]. Because of this both HI and O2 are rapidly consumed: HI is prevented from reacting with propylene and oxygen is prevented from reacting with the hydrocarbons."
