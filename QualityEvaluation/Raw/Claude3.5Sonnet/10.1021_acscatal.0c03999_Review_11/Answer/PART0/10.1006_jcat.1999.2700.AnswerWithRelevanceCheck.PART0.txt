          "The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the introduction of TCM to the feedstream."

"On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conversion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2, although more substantially at the lower values of the latter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly increased."

"With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."

"The addition of a partial pressure of TCM equal to 0.085 kPa produces a conversion approximately twice that observed in its absence and an increase in the C2 + C3 selectivity by more than a factor of three with concomitant decreases in the selectivities to carbon oxides"

"More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."

          The literature primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide as a catalyst, with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive. This method shows significant improvements in propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to oxidative dehydrogenation without TCM.

Key findings for TCM-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation include:
1. Adding TCM (0.17 kPa) increased propane conversion and C3H6 selectivity across all O2 partial pressures tested.
2. In the absence of O2, TCM alone caused 0.8% propane conversion with 71% selectivity to C3H6.
3. A partial pressure of 0.085 kPa TCM doubled propane conversion and tripled C2+C3 selectivity compared to no TCM.

The reaction conditions typically involve a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure, operated at 723 K. The feed usually consisted of propane, oxygen, and TCM in varying partial pressures, diluted with helium.

The study also mentions that similar benefits were observed for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) on Pr6O11 and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 and Pr6O11 when small partial pressures of TCM were added to the feedstream.

However, the document does not provide detailed information on other halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation, such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches.

Regarding the difference in reactivity between propane and other alkanes, the literature mentions that for methane oxidation on cerium oxide, the addition of TCM had no positive effect, producing only carbon oxides. In contrast, for propane, TCM addition significantly improved both conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that propane's reactivity in these processes differs from that of methane, possibly due to its longer carbon chain and different C-H bond strengths.

The literature does not provide enough information to make a comprehensive comparison of propane's reactivity to that of ethane in these processes.

          该文献主要关注使用氧化铈作为催化剂，四氯甲烷（TCM）作为气相添加剂的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。与不添加TCM的氧化脱氢相比，这种方法显著提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

TCM辅助氧化脱氢的主要发现包括：
1. 添加TCM（0.17 kPa）在所有测试的O2分压下都增加了丙烷转化率和C3H6选择性。
2. 在没有O2的情况下，单独使用TCM导致0.8%的丙烷转化，其中71%选择性生成C3H6。
3. 0.085 kPa的TCM分压使丙烷转化率翻倍，C2+C3选择性增加三倍（相比于不添加TCM）。

反应条件通常涉及大气压下的固定床连续流石英反应器，在723 K下操作。进料通常由丙烷、氧气和TCM以不同分压组成，用氦气稀释。

研究还提到，当向进料流中添加少量TCM时，在Pr6O11上的甲烷氧化偶联（OCM）以及在CeO2和Pr6O11上的乙烷氧化脱氢也观察到了类似的好处。

然而，文献没有提供其他卤素辅助丙烷脱氢方法的详细信息，如卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐法。

关于丙烷与其他烷烃反应性的差异，文献提到对于氧化铈上的甲烷氧化，添加TCM没有积极效果，只产生碳氧化物。相比之下，对于丙烷，添加TCM显著提高了转化率和丙烯选择性。这表明丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷不同，可能是由于其较长的碳链和不同的C-H键强度。

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较丙烷与乙烷在这些过程中的反应性。
