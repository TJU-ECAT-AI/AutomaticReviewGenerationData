Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have emerged as promising approaches to produce propene with high yields and selectivity. This review analyzes various methods, their reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity in these processes.

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2):
This method directly uses halogens to remove hydrogen from propane. For example, chlorine-mediated dehydrogenation over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 400°C achieves 50% propane conversion with 95% propene selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes, but requires higher temperatures (>673 K) [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens (X2 + O2):
This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process. The addition of oxygen shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic [10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1]. For instance, using gaseous I2 as a catalyst at 500°C with a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm yields 64% propylene [10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1].

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2):
This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene. The reaction proceeds through the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretically, it can achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2):
This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 in a molten salt form. The reaction typically occurs between 450-600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70% [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. In one study, using a 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600°C with a propane/air mixture of 1:2 achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation:
This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at moderate temperatures below 800 K [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which only have primary carbons [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. This allows for easier C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Additionally, propane can form more stable intermediate species and undergo dehydrogenation more readily to produce propene [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

The presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propene (the product) can lead to successive oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. At high radical concentrations, propane can undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation offer promising alternatives to conventional thermal dehydrogenation processes. Each method has its strengths and limitations, with the choice depending on factors such as desired yield, selectivity, and operating conditions.

Future research could focus on:
1. Developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for halogen-mediated reactions, particularly for lower temperature operations.
2. Optimizing reactor designs to better integrate the different reaction zones in processes like oxyhalogenation.
3. Exploring novel halogen combinations or ratios in bihalogen-mediated processes to further enhance selectivity and yield.
4. Investigating the potential of other metal halide salts or mixtures for molten salt-assisted dehydrogenation.
5. Addressing challenges related to corrosion and environmental concerns associated with halogen use in industrial-scale processes.
6. Developing in-situ regeneration methods for halogen species to improve overall process efficiency.

The unique reactivity of propane in these processes opens up possibilities for tailored reaction conditions and catalysts that can exploit its structural features. Future work could aim to better understand and control the formation of radical species and intermediate products to maximize propene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

As the demand for propene continues to grow, these halogen-assisted methods have the potential to play a significant role in meeting production needs more efficiently and sustainably than traditional processes.

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene have gained significant attention due to their potential for higher yields and improved selectivity compared to conventional dehydrogenation processes. This review section analyzes various approaches, reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity in these processes.

This method involves the direct reaction of propane with halogens, particularly chlorine and iodine. For instance, propane halo-dehydrogenation using Cl2 over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400°C [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

Reaction conditions for these methods generally involve temperatures between 300-700°C, with specific ranges depending on the approach. The presence of oxygen, halogen species, and specialized catalysts or molten salts are crucial factors in determining the reaction outcomes.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which only have primary carbons [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The development of halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation represents a significant advancement in the field of alkane activation. These approaches offer promising alternatives to conventional dehydrogenation processes, potentially addressing challenges such as thermodynamic limitations and catalyst deactivation.

Future research in this area could focus on:

1. Catalyst design: Developing more efficient and stable catalysts that can withstand the corrosive nature of halogen species while maintaining high selectivity towards propene.

2. Process optimization: Integrating these halogen-assisted methods into existing industrial processes, focusing on energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

3. Environmental considerations: Investigating ways to minimize halogen emissions and develop closed-loop systems for halogen recycling.

4. Mechanistic studies: Further elucidating the reaction mechanisms, particularly in complex systems like bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation, to guide rational process design.

5. Application to other alkanes: Exploring the potential of these methods for the activation of longer-chain alkanes or more challenging substrates like methane.

6. Novel reactor designs: Developing specialized reactors that can effectively manage the unique challenges of halogen-assisted processes, such as corrosion resistance and heat management in molten salt systems.

By addressing these areas, researchers can potentially unlock new pathways for more efficient and selective alkane activation, contributing to the broader field of sustainable chemical production and energy systems.
