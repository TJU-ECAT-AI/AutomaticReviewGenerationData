Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation: A comparative analysis of various approaches, reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity

The selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene using halogen-assisted methods has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional dehydrogenation processes. This review analyzes various approaches, their reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity in these processes.

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2):
This method directly uses halogens to remove hydrogen from propane. For instance, propane halo-dehydrogenation using Cl2 over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400°C [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally yields higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes, but requires high temperatures (>673 K) [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens (X2 + O2):
This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process. The addition of oxygen shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic [10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1]. For example, gas-phase iodine-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation at 500°C with a propane partial pressure of 0.1 atm yields 64% propylene [10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1].

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2):
This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene. The reaction proceeds through the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretically, it can achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2):
This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450-600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70% [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. A study using 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600°C, with a propane/air mixture of 1:2, achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene at 500°C [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S] [10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1].

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation:
This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at moderate temperatures below 800 K [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551] [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

Reaction conditions vary for each method but generally involve temperatures between 300-700°C, with some methods requiring higher temperatures (up to 900K for iodine-based processes) [10.1002/cctc.201200913]. Most reactions occur at or near atmospheric pressure.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which only have primary carbons [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. This allows for easier C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Additionally, propane can form more stable intermediate species and undergo dehydrogenation more readily to produce propene [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

The presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propene (the product) can lead to successive oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. At high radical concentrations, propane can undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The comparative analysis of halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation reveals promising avenues for future research and development. The bihalogen-mediated approach, combining the selectivity of iodine with the reactivity of bromine, emerges as a particularly interesting direction for further investigation. This method addresses the limitations of using single halogens and achieves higher yields at lower temperatures.

Future research efforts might focus on:
1. Optimizing catalyst designs for bihalogen-mediated processes to further improve selectivity and yield.
2. Exploring novel molten salt compositions to enhance heat management and equilibrium shifts in metal halide salt-assisted approaches.
3. Developing more efficient methods for halogen recycling to improve the economic viability and environmental sustainability of these processes.
4. Investigating the potential of combining halogen-assisted methods with other emerging technologies, such as membrane reactors or plasma-assisted catalysis, to achieve synergistic effects.
5. Conducting more comprehensive studies on the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of propane activation in various halogen-assisted processes to gain deeper insights into the unique reactivity of propane compared to other alkanes.

These advancements could lead to more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes, potentially revolutionizing the petrochemical industry and reducing its environmental impact.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation offer promising alternatives to conventional thermal dehydrogenation processes. Each method has its strengths and limitations, with the choice depending on factors such as desired yield, selectivity, and operating conditions.

Future research could focus on:
1. Developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for halogen-mediated reactions, particularly for lower temperature operations.
2. Optimizing reactor designs to better integrate the different reaction zones in processes like oxyhalogenation.
3. Exploring novel halogen combinations or ratios in bihalogen-mediated processes to further enhance selectivity and yield.
4. Investigating the potential of other metal halide salts or mixtures for molten salt-assisted dehydrogenation.
5. Addressing challenges related to corrosion and environmental concerns associated with halogen use in industrial-scale processes.
6. Developing in-situ regeneration methods for halogen species to improve overall process efficiency.

The unique reactivity of propane in these processes opens up possibilities for tailored reaction conditions and catalysts that can exploit its structural features. Future work could aim to better understand and control the formation of radical species and intermediate products to maximize propene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

As the demand for propene continues to grow, these halogen-assisted methods have the potential to play a significant role in meeting production needs more efficiently and sustainably than traditional processes.
