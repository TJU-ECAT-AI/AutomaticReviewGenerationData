Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation: A comparative analysis of various approaches, reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional dehydrogenation processes. These methods offer improved yields, lower reaction temperatures, and better control over selectivity. The main approaches include:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2):
This method directly uses halogens to remove hydrogen from propane. For example, using Cl2 with a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 400째C achieves 50% propane conversion with 95% propene selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes, but requires high temperatures (>673 K) [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens (X2 + O2):
This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process. The addition of oxygen shifts the equilibrium towards higher propane conversion and makes the reaction exothermic [10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1]. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, due to consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2):
This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene. The reaction proceeds through the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretically, it can achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2):
This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450-600째C and can achieve propene yields up to 70% [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. In one study, using a 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600째C with a propane/air mixture of 1:2 achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation:
This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at moderate temperatures below 800 K [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

Reaction conditions vary for each method but generally involve temperatures between 300-700째C, with some methods requiring higher temperatures (up to 900 K for iodine-based processes). The presence of oxygen, specific catalysts, and the use of molten salt melts are common features in many of these approaches.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure:

1. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane or ethane, which only have primary carbons [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

2. The presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propene (the product) can lead to successive oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

3. Propane can form both normal and isopropyl radicals, leading to different reaction pathways and influencing selectivity [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].

4. The formation of a stable double bond in propene provides a thermodynamic driving force not present in methane dehydrogenation and less favorable for ethane [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].

5. At high radical concentrations, propane can undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].

These structural differences affect the ease of C-H bond activation, the stability of intermediates formed during the dehydrogenation process, and the overall reaction pathways, leading to different product distributions compared to shorter chain alkanes.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation represents a significant advancement in the field of alkane activation. These methods offer promising alternatives to conventional dehydrogenation processes, potentially addressing issues of high energy consumption and catalyst deactivation.

Future research directions may include:

1. Catalyst development: Designing novel catalysts that can further improve selectivity and conversion rates while minimizing side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

2. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs and process configurations to optimize heat management and product separation, potentially leading to more efficient and economical industrial-scale operations.

3. Mechanistic studies: Conducting in-depth investigations into the reaction mechanisms of various halogen-assisted methods to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing selectivity and reactivity.

4. Sustainability considerations: Developing strategies to minimize halogen consumption and improve halogen recycling efficiency, addressing environmental concerns associated with halogen use.

5. Expansion to other alkanes: Applying the insights gained from propane dehydrogenation to develop similar processes for other alkanes, potentially opening new pathways for the valorization of light hydrocarbons.

6. Integration with renewable energy: Exploring the potential of coupling these processes with renewable energy sources to create more sustainable chemical production routes.

By addressing these areas, researchers can further improve the efficiency and selectivity of halogen-assisted propane dehydrogenation methods, potentially revolutionizing the production of propylene and other valuable chemical intermediates.
