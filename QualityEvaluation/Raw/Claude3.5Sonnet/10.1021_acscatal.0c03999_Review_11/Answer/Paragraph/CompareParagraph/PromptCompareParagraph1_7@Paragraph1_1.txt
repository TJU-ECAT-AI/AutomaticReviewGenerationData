Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation: A comparative analysis of various approaches, reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity

Several halogen-assisted methods have been developed for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene, each with distinct advantages and challenges. These methods include dehydrogenation with molecular halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens, propane oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt-assisted approaches.

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2):
This method involves directly reacting propane with halogens, particularly chlorine or iodine. For example, propane halo-dehydrogenation using Cl2 over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400°C [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes, but requires high temperatures (>673 K) to overcome thermodynamic limitations [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens (X2 + O2):
This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process. For instance, the addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) to the feedstream in oxidative dehydrogenation over cerium oxide significantly improves propane conversion and C3H6 selectivity [10.1006/jcat.1999.2700]. Another example is the use of bromine-iodine mixtures with low iodine content (≤20%), which results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K) [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2):
This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene. The reaction proceeds through the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretically, it can achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Propane oxychlorination using metal phosphate catalysts (MPO, where M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) at temperatures between 673-773 K has shown promising results, with the best performing catalyst (CrPO) achieving propylene yields up to 50% at 95% selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.9b01315].

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2):
This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450-600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70% [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. A specific example is the use of a 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600°C, with a propane/air mixture of 1:2 [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S]. By optimizing this method, researchers have achieved 80% propane conversion and 84% selectivity to propylene at 500°C [10.1007/s10562-016-1701-1].

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane or ethane, which only have primary carbons [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. This allows for easier C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. Additionally, propane can form more stable intermediate species and undergo dehydrogenation more readily to produce propene [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

However, the increased reactivity of propane also presents challenges. The presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propene (the product) can lead to successive oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. At high radical concentrations, propane can undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].

In conclusion, each halogen-assisted method for propane dehydrogenation offers unique advantages and faces specific challenges. The choice of method depends on factors such as desired yield, selectivity, reaction conditions, and economic considerations. The distinct reactivity of propane compared to other alkanes necessitates careful optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst selection to maximize propene production while minimizing unwanted side reactions.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comparative analysis of various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation reveals a complex interplay between reaction conditions, catalyst choice, and molecular structure. Future research in this field could focus on several promising directions:

1. Development of novel catalysts: Given the success of metal phosphates and molten metal halides, there is potential for designing new catalysts that combine the benefits of different approaches. For example, exploring bimetallic or multi-component catalysts that can facilitate both halogenation and dehydrogenation steps more efficiently.

2. Process intensification: Investigating ways to combine different methods, such as integrating molten salt approaches with gas-phase halogen catalysis, could lead to more efficient and selective processes. This could potentially address challenges like overoxidation and unwanted side reactions.

3. In-situ regeneration of halogens: Developing systems that can efficiently regenerate and recycle halogens in-situ could significantly improve the economic viability and sustainability of these processes.

4. Mechanistic studies: Further research into the reaction mechanisms, particularly the formation and behavior of radical intermediates, could provide insights for better controlling selectivity and minimizing unwanted products like benzene.

5. Alternative halogen sources: Exploring the use of more environmentally friendly or cost-effective halogen sources could make these processes more attractive for industrial implementation.

6. Reactor design: Innovative reactor designs that can better manage heat distribution and product separation could enhance the overall efficiency of these processes.

7. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced computational methods to predict optimal reaction conditions and catalyst compositions could accelerate the development of more efficient propane dehydrogenation processes.

These research directions could lead to more sustainable and economically viable processes for propene production, potentially revolutionizing the petrochemical industry and reducing reliance on traditional, energy-intensive cracking processes.

Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have emerged as promising approaches to overcome the limitations of conventional dehydrogenation processes. This review analyzes various halogen-assisted methods, their reaction conditions, and propane's unique reactivity compared to other alkanes.

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2):
This method directly uses halogens to remove hydrogen from propane. For example, propane halo-dehydrogenation with Cl2 over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400°C [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes, but requires high temperatures (>673 K) [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens (X2 + O2):
This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process. The addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) to the feedstream in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide significantly increases propane conversion and C3H6 selectivity [10.1006/jcat.1999.2700]. Iodine-based processes are highly selective but require very high temperatures (900K) to give good yields of C3H6+C3H7I [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2):
This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene. Theoretically, it can achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate catalysts produces mainly ethyl bromide at low temperatures, but propylene selectivity increases rapidly with temperature (typically 750-850 K) [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2):
This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450-600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70% [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. Experiments using a 5 wt.-% LiOH*H2O/LiI salt melt at 600°C, with a propane/air mixture of 1:2, have shown promising results [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].

5. Bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation:
This novel approach uses both Br2 and I2 as mediators. Adding a small amount of bromine to the iodination reaction significantly promotes propane conversion and product selectivity. High yields of propene and propyl halides (up to 80%) can be achieved at moderate temperatures below 800 K [10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00551].

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which only have primary carbons [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11]. The presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propene (the product) can lead to successive oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_11].

The ability to form both normal and isopropyl radicals leads to different reaction pathways and influences selectivity [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S]. At high radical concentrations, propane can undergo coupling reactions to form larger molecules like benzene, which is not possible with methane and less likely with ethane [10.1016/0166-9834(91)80033-S].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation has opened up new possibilities for more efficient and selective propylene production. The various approaches discussed offer different advantages and challenges, suggesting that future research could focus on optimizing these processes and potentially combining their best features.

One promising direction is the further development of bihalogen-mediated dehydrogenation, which has shown high yields at moderate temperatures. Research could explore different halogen combinations and ratios to fine-tune reactivity and selectivity. Additionally, the integration of molten salt techniques with bihalogen systems could potentially improve heat management and product separation.

The unique reactivity of propane compared to methane and ethane in these processes suggests that tailored catalyst designs could further enhance selectivity. Future studies might focus on developing catalysts that can selectively activate secondary C-H bonds while minimizing overoxidation of the propene product.

Furthermore, the development of in-situ regeneration methods for halogen species could improve the economic viability and sustainability of these processes. This could involve exploring novel reactor designs that allow for continuous regeneration of halogen species while maintaining high propene selectivity.

Lastly, computational modeling and machine learning techniques could be employed to predict optimal reaction conditions and catalyst compositions for different halogen-assisted methods, potentially leading to more efficient and selective processes for propane dehydrogenation.
