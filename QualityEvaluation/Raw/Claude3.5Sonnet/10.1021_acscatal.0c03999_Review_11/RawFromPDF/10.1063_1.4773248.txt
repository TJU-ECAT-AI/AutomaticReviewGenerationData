Ceria (CeO2) is a promising catalyst for the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to liquid fuels and commodity chemicals, in part because of its high oxygen storage capacity, yet the fundamentals of CO2 adsorption, activation, and reduction on ceria surfaces remain largely unknown. We use density functional theory, corrected for onsite Coulombic interactions (GGA+U), to explore various adsorption sites and configurations for CO2 on stoichiometric and reduced ceria (110), the latter with either an in-plane oxygen vacancy or a split oxygen vacancy. We find that CO2 adsorption on both reduced ceria (110) surfaces is thermodynamically favored over the corresponding adsorption on stoichiometric ceria (110), but the most stable adsorption configuration consists of CO2 adsorbed parallel to the reduced ceria (110) surface at a split oxygen vacancy. Structural changes in the CO2 molecule are also observed upon adsorption. At the split vacancy, the molecule bends out of plane to form a unidentate carbonate with the remaining oxygen anion at the surface; this is in stark contrast to the bridged carbonate observed for CO2 adsorption at the in-plane vacancy. Also, we analyze the pathways for CO2 conversion to CO on reduced ceria (110). The subtle difference in the energies of activation for the elementary steps suggest that CO2 dissociation is favored on the split vacancy, while the reverse process of CO oxidation may favor the formation of the in-plane vacancy. We thus show how the structure and properties of the ceria catalyst govern the mechanism of CO2 activation and reduction.

I. INTRODUCTION
The synthesis of liquid fuels and commodity chemicals from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising approach for clean energy production. For this reason, much academic and industrial effort has been devoted to exploring efficient means of reducing CO2.1 It is widely believed that the first step in CO2 reduction is the activation of the C=O bond and charge transfer for the eventual formation of an anion radical species.2 Since CO2 is thermodynamically stable and the formation of the radical is difficult in the gas phase3 (i.e., −1.90 V vs. NHE4), we seek appropriate catalysts for lowering the activation barrier to (photo)electrochemical CO2 reduction.
There have been several metal oxides proposed for CO2 activation, such as ZrO2,5 TiO2,6–9 MgO,10 and CaO.11 Among these various catalysts for CO2 activation, ceria (CeO2) is attracting increased interest due to its high oxygen storage capacity. Ceria is commonly used for oxidation and reduction reactions, since Ce ably and reversibly converts between Ce4+ and Ce3+ upon release and storage of oxygen.12 
A number of first-principles studies on ceria have confirmed the structure and properties of the stoichiometric bulk and associated surfaces. Reduced ceria surfaces that contain oxygen vacancies have also been studied extensively.13–16 In this work, we focus on the ceria (110) surface, for which the stoichiometric repeating unit consists of two oxygen anions and two cerium cations that are bonded in a diamond configuration and to other repeating units. While the ordering of the thermodynamic stability of ceria surfaces is (111) > (110) > (100),17–19 it is believed that the metastable ceria (110) surface is more catalytically active than either the (111) or the (100) surfaces, since the creation of oxygen vacancies on the ceria (110) surface requires the least amount of energy.20–23 Thus, the ceria (110) surface appears to be the most promising candidate for catalyzing reactions that involve oxygen cycling with the adsorbates, so we focus on this low-index surface for carbon dioxide reduction.
Naturally, the formation of surface oxygen vacancies is key to the success of the proposed catalytic reaction. Two types of vacancies have been reported on the ceria (110) surface: (1) In-plane vacancy structure, and (2) split vacancy structure. From the baseline repeating unit, the in-plane vacancy structure simply has one of the surface oxygen anions removed, and little surface reconstruction is observed; this structure has been confirmed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.23,24 The split vacancy structure, however, exhibits significant in-plane and out-of-plane movement of the remaining surface oxygen anion (Ov), so that it bridges the surface cerium cations and is situated above the topmost atomic layer; this structure has also been confirmed by DFT calculations,20,21,25 embedded cluster calculations with many-body perturbation theory,18 and potential-based molecular dynamics simulations.26 The split vacancy structure has also been observed for metal-doped ceria (110) surfaces.27 Since these two vacancy structures are quite different, CO2 adsorption, and eventually reduction, at these sites may follow different pathways. Thus, carbon dioxide reduction at both types of surface vacancies should be considered to understand the effect of catalyst structure on reactivity.19,28–31
In particular, we are interested in determining whether carbon dioxide necessarily follows the simple dissociation to form carbon monoxide (CO) and “heal” the surface vacancy on the reduced ceria (110) surface, or whether it may follow a different reduction pathway. The “reverse” of this process, namely, CO oxidation on stoichiometric ceria,30,32–35 has been well-studied for a range of applications, including three-way automotive catalysts (TWC),36 the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction,37,38 and syngas production.39,40 However, CO2 reactivity remains ambiguous, since neither theoretical nor experimental studies have clarified the exact mechanism of CO2 activation nor the structure of the adsorbed species on the ceria (110) surface. A recent x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) study supports the hypotheses that CO2 activation may involve formation of surface carboxylates, and the degree of carbonate formation may not be directly related to the surface re-oxidation process.41 Another recent resonant photoemission spectroscopy (RPES) study suggests that partial re-oxidation of reduced ceria occurs with high reaction probability, so that further clarification of CO2 activation and surface re-oxidation is necessary.42 
We now present three sets of theoretical and computational studies that aim to provide a mechanistic understanding of CO2 activation and reduction on ceria (110) surfaces. First, we demonstrate the formation of the in-plane and split vacancies on the ceria (110) surface, and quantify the resulting structures and energetics. Second, we quantify the adsorption and electronic properties, including charge transfer, for CO2 on the stoichiometric ceria (110) surface, reduced (in-plane vacancy) ceria (110) surface, and reduced (split vacancy) ceria (110) surface. Third, we map out reaction pathways for CO2 dissociation to CO, with accompanying energies of activation, at the in-plane and split vacancies. Our results provide detailed theoretical evidence that reduced ceria surfaces induce CO2 activation to form carbonate anions, but the nature of these carbonates depends on the geometry of the vacancy site; thus, the mechanism and energetics of CO2 dissociation depends greatly on the structure and properties of the catalyst surface, so that it cannot be always considered as the reverse of CO oxidation on the stoichiometric ceria catalyst.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
All calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT),43,44 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.2).45–47 The generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof48 was used to represent the exchange-correlation energy. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method,49,50 with a 400 eV energy cutoff, was used to describe the wavefunctions of the atomic cores. The tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections51 was used to set the partial occupancies for the orbitals. While several k-point mesh sizes (e.g., 4 × 4 × 4 up to 11 × 11 × 11) were considered, we ultimately used the 6 × 6 × 6 Γ-centered Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh for bulk ceria to give results that were sufficiently converged within 1 × 10−5 eV, using the conjugate gradient method.
The electronic band structure of bulk ceria contains two energy gaps, as determined by XPS spectra: (1) A 3 eV band gap between the O 2p valence band and the Ce 4f conduction band, and (2) a 6 eV band gap between the valence band and the Ce 5d band.52–54 Since it is difficult to accurately represent the 4f states in ceria using conventional DFT methods,14,55,56 we chose to employ the Hubbard U parameter within the GGA+U approach.57,58 The Hubbard U term acts as an on-site Coulombic interaction to properly localize the electrons in these states, which is especially important for the calculations on reduced ceria, with its partially occupied 4f states. We chose for our ceria system Ueff = 5 eV, which is consistent with recommended values previously published in the literature.59 
The bulk ceria unit cell contains 8 oxygen atoms and 4 cerium atoms in a cubic unit cell with the

symmetry space group; the initial lattice parameter is |a| = 5.411 Å.60 After GGA+U geometry optimization, the bulk lattice parameter increased slightly to |a| = 5.413 Å; this compares favorably to previous studies that also follow the DFT approach61 as well as the bulk lattice parameter of |a| = 5.482 Å obtained using pure GGA. For comparison, we note that the use of Ueff = 3 eV gives |a| = 5.478 Å, and Ueff = 7 eV gives |a| = 5.381 Å. Thus, Ueff = 5 eV is used in all subsequent calculations.
Semi-infinite slab models, consisting of 10 atomic layers and 15 Å of vacuum between periodic images in the z direction, were cleaved along the (110) plane from the optimized bulk ceria unit cell; following optimization, we observed that atomic layer relaxation occurred primarily within the three topmost layers. Thus, we cleaved the slab in half along the xy plane, so that the slab consisting of 5 atomic layers (overall slab thickness is 7.622 Å), with the bottom two layers constrained in space, was used for all subsequent calculations. The other atoms were free to move in all directions within the fixed lattice. A p(2 × 2) supercell, with a corresponding 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh, is used in accordance with the practice adopted by other researchers studying the adsorption of small molecules on the ceria (110) surface.62–64 We believe that the exposed surface area is large enough to accommodate a small gas-phase adsorbate (e.g., CO2) without spurious interactions from neighboring images, as we will show in Sec. III.

is the total energy of the composite system. Since the calculations were performed at 0 K and fixed cell volume, the differences in Gibbs free energy should equal the differences in total energy. By this definition, a negative value of Eads corresponds to an exothermic and spontaneous adsorption process.
Since the clean ceria (110) surface is atomically flat, both parallel and perpendicular/vertical orientations of CO2 were chosen for analysis and comparison, and the energies of adsorption were calculated for each orientation on the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces. The excess spin densities and Bader charges65 were also calculated to lend insight into the role of charge transfer in CO2 adsorption and activation on the ceria (110) surface.
The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method66,67 was used to locate transition states and map out reaction pathways for CO2 dissociation on the reduced ceria surfaces. By including four images between the initial and final states, the CI-NEB method was able to successfully drive the highest energy image up to the exact saddle point and yield accurate minimum energy paths for CO2 dissociation to CO.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The stoichiometric ceria (110) surface contains several distinct sites, including: (1) Threefold coordinated O atoms in the topmost atomic layer (nO), (2) fourfold coordinated O atoms in the subsurface atomic layer (nnO), (3) sixfold coordinated Ce atoms in the topmost atomic layer (nCe), (4) eightfold coordinated Ce atoms in the subsurface atomic layer (nnCe), and (5) hollow. The reduced ceria (110) surface contains similar sites, except that nCe and nnCe denote fivefold coordinated Ce atoms in the topmost atomic layer and sevenfold coordinated Ce atoms in the subsurface atomic layer, respectively (Figure 1). This nomenclature will be used throughout to describe changes in the adsorption con uration and electronic structure at the surface.

A. Oxygen vacancy formation on ceria (110)
As stated in Sec. I, two distinct types of oxygen vacancy sites, in-plane and split, may form on the reduced ceria (110) surface. In this work, only a single oxygen vacancy per p(2 × 2) supercell was considered to isolate its effect on CO2 activation. For the in-plane vacancy structure, the nO anion nearest the vacancy site moves slightly in-plane towards the vacancy. The resulting Ce–O distances are 2.28–2.29 Å, compared to 2.34 Å in the stoichiometric surface. The nnCe cations also relax only slightly away from the vacancy, so that the nnCe-nnO distances are 2.31 Å.
For the split vacancy structure, the nO anion nearest the vacancy site moves to fill the vacancy, so that nO is almost equidistant between two nCe atoms; it also moves out of the surface plane in the perpendicular direction. Furthermore, the other nnO and nnCe atoms near the vacancy move slightly away (0.07–0.09 Å) from the vacancy, so that the vacancy site, although split, is still quite large in area and volume. As a result, the average nnCe-nnO distances near the vacancy site increases to 2.35 Å, compared to 2.27 Å in stoichiometric ceria (110). This surface reconstruction in reduced ceria (110) is in agreement with results previously reported in the literature.68–71 
To compare the stability of these two reduced surfaces, we calculate the vacancy formation energy. We find that the split vacancy structure is slightly more energetically stable, with a vacancy formation energy of +1.651 eV, compared to the in-plane vacancy structure, with a vacancy formation energy of +1.962 eV (Figure 2). Our results are comparable to the previously reported split vacancy formation energy of +1.61 eV (Ref. 25) and in-plane vacancy formation energy of +1.99 eV.24,72 Furthermore, an increase in supercell size from p(2 × 2) to p(3 × 3) does not affect the geometric structure (i.e., Ce–O distances) and only decreases the vacancy formation energy by 2.3%; thus, the p(2 × 2) supercell is sufficient for the ensuing analysis.

B. CO2 adsorption on stoichiometric and reduced ceria (110)
We now present structures and energies of adsorption for CO2 on the stoichiometric and reduced ceria (110) surfaces.
1. CO2 adsorption on stoichiometric ceria (110)
On stoichiometric ceria (110), seven configurations where CO2 is adsorbed parallel to the surface (along either the x or y axis) and four configurations where CO2 is adsorbed perpendicular/vertical to the surface are considered (Figure 3). The energies of adsorption, select geometrical parameters, and variation of the total Bader charge of the adsorbed CO2 molecule, following geometry optimization to local minima, are shown in Table I.

The strongest energy of adsorption (Eads = −0.262 eV) is observed for nnO adsorbing as a “bridge” between two nCe atoms (Sp5). The two C–O bonds in CO2 are slightly elongated to 1.196 Å and 1.207 Å, compared to 1.176 Å in the gas phase. The CO2 molecule are nearly linear, with a O–C–O angle of 178.2°. The two oxygen atoms in CO2 reside at the top of two sixfold coordinated surface nCe atoms, and the Ce–O distances are 2.520 Å and 2.527 Å, respectively. An additional depiction of this adsorption configuration (Sp5) is shown in Figure 4.
FIG. 4.

CO2 adsorption on stoichiometric ceria (110) in selected configurations: Sp5, Sv4, and Sv1. Both structural parameters and energies of adsorption are depicted.
The Sv4 and Sv1 adsorption configurations are in vertical orientation and tilted slightly relative to the surface normal, yet are slightly less energetically favorable than Sp5 (Eads = −0.253 eV and Eads = −0.201 eV, respectively). For Sv4, the CO2 adsorbs at the nnO-nnO hollow site, which is flanked by two subsurface ceria atoms (nnCe) and two subsurface oxygen atoms (nnO). The distance between the ceria surface and the adsorbing oxygen atom in CO2 is 2.631 Å. For Sv1, the CO2 adsorbs at the nO-nO hollow site, which is flanked by two surface ceria atoms (nCe) and two surface oxygen atoms (nO). The distance between the ceria surface and the adsorbing oxygen atom in CO2 is 2.573 Å. The symmetry of these two hollow sites reduces the net intermolecular forces acting on the CO2 molecule, so these adsorption configurations are relatively stable. However, the lengths of the two C–O bonds in CO2 for the Sv4 and Sv1 configurations are similar to those in gas-phase CO2. Additional depictions of these two adsorption configurations are shown in Figure 4.
Several other adsorption configurations merit discussion, in terms of alignment of the adsorbate and consideration of surface/subsurface effects. For Sp1 and Sp4, the C atom of CO2 resides on top of the surface nO atom, but is aligned along different axes (x and y, respectively). Both Sp1 and Sp4 result in very weak physisorption, with Sp4 being slightly favored energetically due to the increased electrostatic repulsion with the neighboring surface nO oxygen in the Sp1 configuration compared to the repulsion with the subsurface nnO oxygens in the Sp4 configuration. For Sp2 and Sv2, where CO2 is adsorbed on top of the surface nCe atom, the energy of adsorption is stronger than that for Sp6 and Sv3, respectively, where CO2 is adsorbed on top of the subsurface nnCe atom. Any differences in electrostatic repulsion with subsurface nnCe or nnO atoms appear to be minimal, as the energies of adsorption for the Sp3 and Sp7 configurations are nearly identical. Thus, we propose that only surface atoms appear to significantly influence the strength of CO2 adsorption to the stoichiometric ceria (110) surface.
In general, all of these adsorption configurations on stoichiometric ceria (110) would be classified as weak physisorption, since the CO2 molecule remains physically unchanged upon adsorption and the distance between CO2 and the surface is more than 2.52 Å, which is too far to form a Ce–O bond. Furthermore, the Bader charge analysis indicates that the variation of the total charge of adsorbed CO2 is less than −0.01|e|, so there is no significant change in the electronic structure. We can conclude that stoichiometric ceria (110) does not activate the CO2 molecule.
2. CO2 adsorption on reduced (in-plane vacancy) ceria (110)
For reduced ceria (110) with an in-plane vacancy, we only considered CO2 adsorption at the vacancy, since the remainder of the surface is structurally identical to stoichiometric ceria (110) due to the lack of surface reconstruction. We found that the most stable configuration is Rv(InP), as shown in Figure 5, with an energy of adsorption of −1.043 eV. For this configuration, one O atom of the CO2 molecule is bound to a surface fivefold coordinated nCe atom that neighbors the vacancy site, and the C atom of the CO2 molecule is bound to the other surface fivefold coordinated nCe atom. This structure, while slightly distorted, would be analogous to the bridged carbonate, formed by CO adsorption to the stoichiometric ceria (110) surface, reported in the literature.30,32,35

The C atom of the CO2 molecule does not bind to the nO surface oxygen atom neighboring the vacancy in this initial adsorption step, since the oxygen atom is already coordinatively saturated. Instead, it appears to associate with the nearby cerium atoms, so that the Ce–C distance of 1.573 Å is much smaller than the Ce–O distance of 2.011 Å between the surface and adsorbate in the Rv(InP) configuration. The adsorbed CO2 molecule exhibits a bent configuration, where the O–C–O angle is 140.1°. The two C–O bonds are, however, asymmetrically elongated compared to their values in the gas phase molecule; the C–O bond near the surface increases in length to 1.302 Å, which is about 0.1 Å longer than the other C–O bond length of 1.214 Å in the adsorbed CO2 molecule. We can denote this adsorption structure as an inorganic carboxylate, which has been reported in experimental studies.28,73 The energy of adsorption for the Rv(InP) configuration is −1.043 eV, so the interaction of CO2 with the in-plane vacancy may be classified as chemisorption.
3. CO2 adsorption on reduced (split vacancy) ceria (110)
The optimized adsorption configurations of CO2 on reduced ceria (110), with a split vacancy, are shown in Figure 6. Seven configurations where CO2 is adsorbed parallel to the surface (along either the x or y axis) and four configurations where CO2 is adsorbed perpendicular/vertical to the surface were considered. The energies of adsorption, select geometrical parameters, and variation of the total Bader charge of the adsorbed CO2 molecule, following geometry optimization to local minima, are shown in Table II.

The strongest energy of adsorption (Eads = −1.233 eV) is observed for CO2 parallel adsorption as a “bridge” between two nCe atoms (Rp5) adjacent to the vacancy site. From Figure 6, we can see the carbon atom of the adsorbate is situated directly above the nO atom that had moved toward the vacancy oxygen atom. Furthermore, the adsorbed CO2 molecule exhibits a bent configuration, where the O–C–O angle is 136.9°. Also, the two C–O bonds in the adsorbed CO2 molecule are elongated (almost) symmetrically to 1.246 Å and 1.256 Å, compared to 1.176 Å in the gas phase. Thus, we would again classify this process as chemisorption. Although there is significant lengthening of the C–O bonds, complete dissociation to form CO+O is not observed due to the symmetric nature of the bond lengthening. Instead, a unidentate carbonate structure is formed upon surface adsorption, where the C–O distance between adsorbed CO2 and the surface nO atom is 1.498 Å. On the catalyst, the Ce–O distances at the vacancy are significantly longer (2.292-2.237 Å) upon adsorption than the corresponding Ce–O distance in the clean reduced surface (2.165 Å). An additional depiction of this adsorption configuration (Rp5) is shown in Figure 5.
The next strongest energy of adsorption (Eads = −1.012 eV) is observed for CO2 parallel adsorption on top of the vacancy (Rp4). The two C–O bonds in the adsorbed CO2 molecule are 1.198 Å and 1.311 Å, respectively. The adsorbed CO2 molecule exhibits a similar binding geometry and bent configuration with Rp5; however, the O–C–O angle is slightly larger (140.4°) than the corresponding O–C–O angle in Rp5 (136.9°). Furthermore, the C–O distance between adsorbed CO2 and the vacancy nO atom in Rp4 is also larger (1.642 Å), than the corresponding C–O distance in Rp5, which suggests that the adsorbed CO2 molecule is not as activated as in the Rp5 configuration. Other parallel adsorption configurations are much less energetically stable, thus, we will not explore these configurations further.
Vertical adsorption atop the vacancy site (Rv1) is slightly less energetically favorable (Eads = −0.815 eV) than for Rp5 or Rp4, and we observe no analogous activation of the CO2 molecule; the resulting O–C–O angle is 177.1° and no significant changes are measured in the C–O bond lengths compared to the gas phase values. Though one oxygen atom of the CO2 molecule is close to the split vacancy, the geometry of this site is just small enough to prevent an oxygen atom of CO2 from inserting into the narrow split vacancy; thus, the CO2 molecule in the Rv1 configuration cannot fully “heal” the vacancy to initiate the regeneration of the stoichiometric surface. Vertical adsorption atop the nCe atom nearest the vacancy site (Rv2), although similar to Rv(InP) for the in-plane vacancy, is less energetically favorable (Eads = −0.265 eV) than adsorption atop the vacancy site (Rv1), even though the adsorbed molecule is bent similarly to Rp5. The other adsorption configurations on reduced ceria (110), where CO2 is adsorbed far from the vacancy site, are even less energetically stable, with energies of adsorption on the same order of magnitude as those on stoichiometric ceria (110); thus, we will not explore these configurations further.
In our comparison of the Rp5, Rv1, and Rv(InP) CO2 adsorption configurations, we note that Rp5 is the most energetically stable of the three. When we compared the energetic stability of the in-plane vs. split vacancy ceria (110) surfaces, we noted that the surface with a split vacancy was more stable, by 0.311 eV, than the surface with an in-plane vacancy. Now, CO2 adsorption on the split vacancy is still more stable, by 0.18 eV, than adsorption on the in-plane vacancy. Rp5 contains symmetrically elongated C–O bonds that favor carbonate formation, while Rv(InP) contains asymmetrically elongated C–O bonds that may promote dissociation to form carbon monoxide. Furthermore, vertical adsorption is favored only at the in-plane vacancy, while parallel adsorption is favored at the split vacancy. These differences in CO2 adsorption configuration as a function of the surface structure may contribute to the differences in the preferred mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction.
C. Electronic analysis of ceria as a catalyst for CO2 activation
We seek to understand the underlying electronic structure effects that are responsible for the strong chemisorption of CO2 to reduced ceria (110) with a split oxygen vacancy. We believe that it is likely that the structural changes in the catalyst surface observed upon CO2 adsorption may be attributable to charge transfer between the surface and adsorbate molecule. We now analyze the electronic structure of the split vacancy system, and compare to the previously published electronic analysis of the in-plane vacancy structure .23,24
The partial electronic density of states (PEDOS) for Ce and O, when we have the clean (i.e., no adsorbate) reduced ceria (110) surface, is shown in Figure 7(a), and it is consistent with those previously published in the literature.20,21,25 We aligned the top of the valence band to 0 eV, and observed a filled gap state in the middle of the band gap; this filled gap corresponds to the unoccupied Ce 4f state. The integration of this peak indicates that there are two electrons per oxygen vacancy. To locate these two electrons, we plotted the excess electron spin density, which is defined as the difference between the up spin density and the down spin density, for clean reduced ceria (110), as shown in Figure 8(a). We see that the spin density on the clean reduced ceria (110) surface is localized on the two nCe atoms on the surface nearest the vacancy. The shapes of the two isosurfaces resemble those of f orbitals, which is consistent with the 4f electronic configuration in Ce3+. Since cerium exists in the Ce4+ state in stoichiometric ceria, the excess electron spin density plot suggests that it adopts the Ce3+ state upon formation of the oxygen vacancy. This result is also in agreement with previous observations on other reduced ceria surfaces.74

The PEDOS for Ce and O in the situation where CO2 is adsorbed to reduced ceria (110) is shown in Figure 7(b). We observe that the gap between the Fermi level (top of the unoccupied Ce 4f peak) and the bottom of the conduction band widens upon CO2 adsorption, and nears the value observed for stoichiometric ceria (110).13 In addition, the filled gap state peak narrows upon CO2 adsorption; the integration of this peak indicates that there is only one electron per oxygen vacancy, compared to two electrons in the clean reduced surface. To locate the remaining electron, we plotted the excess electron spin density for reduced ceria (110) with adsorbed CO2 (Rp5), as shown in Figure 8(b). From Figure 8(b), we observe that the remaining electron is localized on the nCe2 atom; thus one reduced Ce3+ cation (nCe2) remains on the surface, while the other (nCe1) has been re-oxidized back to Ce4+. The asymmetric electric field at the surface vacancy, with one Ce3+ and one Ce4+, explains the asymmetric C–O bond elongation found in the most stable adsorption configuration (Rp5). We also observe that the re-oxidized Ce4+ atom is closer in distance to the nO oxygen atom that moved towards the vacancy site upon surface reduction, while the Ce3+ atom is further from this nO oxygen atom and the adsorbed CO2 molecule due to electrostatic repulsion. These results indicate that the reduced ceria (110) surface has been partially oxidized upon CO2 adsorption at the vacancy site.
Since the CO2 molecule may accept electrons into its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital to form the carbonate anion, we performed a Bader charge analysis on the system, focusing on the interface between CO2 and the reduced ceria (110) surface, and plotted the electron localization function (ELF).75 From the variation of the Bader charges on the CO2 molecule in various adsorption configurations (Tables I and II), we observe definitive charge transfer from the ceria surface to the adsorbed CO2 molecule. This is especially prominent in the case of the Rp5 configuration shown in Figure 8, where a net charge of −0.955|e| is transferred to form an adsorbed unidentate carbonate species that is especially stable (Edes = +3.89 eV). This is confirmed by the ELF plot shown in Figure 8(c), where it can be seen that the adsorbed CO2 is activated, with a net negative charge localized on the oxygen atoms of the molecule. When comparing to the most stable CO2 adsorption at the in-plane vacancy (Rv(InP)), a net charge of −0.923|e| is transferred from the surface to the adsorbate molecule. Thus, ceria (110) containing either an in-plane or split oxygen vacancy may activate CO2 via charge transfer to the molecule.

Upon formation of the oxygen vacancy, adjacent cerium atoms are reduced to Ce3+. Upon CO2 adsorption, one cerium cation is re-oxidized back to Ce4+ and the excess charge of −0.955|e| is transferred to the adsorbate. An adsorbed unidentate carbonate species is formed. The Ce–O bonds at the surface are also lengthened. (a) Excess ESD for reduced ceria (110), (b) excess ESD upon CO2 absorption, and (c) ELF upon CO2 absorption.
In summary, we conclude that the specific structure of the ceria surface has a critical influence on the CO2 activation. CO2 may chemisorb to reduced ceria (110) with an energy of adsorption of −1.223 eV, with charge transfer from the reduced ceria surface to the adsorbate resulting in the formation of an activated unidentate carbonate species. The reduced ceria (110) surface is only partially re-oxidized, which suggests that there is additional capacity for further reaction if the CO2 concentration at the surface is increased. Our present findings, though conducted on the ceria (110) surface, are in agreement with related experimental work on the ceria (111) surface, in which the researchers showed that re-oxidation of the ceria surfaces using CO2 would only be energetically feasible at the adsorption sites that have been sufficiently reduced.42 Furthermore, partial re-oxidation of reduced ceria occurs with high reaction probability even at room temperature,42 so we propose that reduced ceria is a promising catalyst for CO2 activation and further reaction.
D. CO2 dissociation on reduced ceria (110)
The results presented above show that CO2 adsorbs strongly on reduced ceria (110) surfaces, with the split oxygen vacancy being preferred slightly over the in-plane vacancy. We infer that the adsorption process itself results in a significant weakening of the C–O bonds of the carbon dioxide molecule. Thus, we seek to determine how these differences in structure and electronic properties, for both the catalyst and adsorbate, may dictate the reactivity of the system with respect to CO2 dissociation to form CO, which we choose among several possibilities for CO2 for its conceptual similarity to the reverse process of CO oxidation. With the dissociation of a C–O bond, the resulting O atom may “heal” the surface vacancy to regenerate the stoichiometric ceria surface. We now show the proposed reaction pathways, including transition states and intermediates, for this process at the in-plane and split oxygen vacancies.
The proposed carbon cycle is shown in Figure 9, based on the different most stable adsorption configurations for CO2 and its dissociation products on the in-plane and split vacancy structures. The local minima and saddle points on the multi-dimensional potential energy surface were identified and optimized from the NEB method. The computed energies of activation are also shown.

Proposed carbon cycle for interconversion between CO2 and CO, with reduced ceria (110) possessing either an in-plane vacancy or a split vacancy.
On the in-plane vacancy structure, we see that CO2 dissociation proceeds from the Rv(InP) inorganic bidentate carboxylate (pathway a). On the split vacancy structure, we see that the CO2 dissociation proceeds from the Rp5 unidentate carbonate (pathway b). All energies are normalized by setting the total energy of the final state of both pathways, namely the p(2 × 2) supercell of the stoichiometric ceria (110) surface with adsorbed CO, to be 0 eV.
The dissociation process initiated from the Rv(InP) adsorption configuration is depicted in Figure 10(a). The reaction involves an initial interconversion from the inorganic bidentate carboxylate species to an unsymmetric bridged carbonate species (stage 2a), with an activation energy barrier of +1.613 eV. In this step, the C atom moves toward the saturated surface O atom neighboring the in-plane vacancy, and pulls it out the surface to form a new C–nO bond by breaking the O-nnCe bond. In the second step of the pathway, the asymmetric bridged carbonate reconstructs into a symmetric bridged (bidentate) carbonate (stage 3a) to mitigate the steric effect, and must overcome only a small energy barrier of +0.172 eV. For the symmetric bridged carbonate structure, the lengths of the C–Og2 bond and C–Ov bond are 1.362 Å and 1.368 Å, respectively, while the length of the upward C–Og1 bond is 1.244 Å; thus, the system appears to be ripe for CO formation. The calculated energy of desorption is +1.891 eV, which indicates that CO is strongly adsorbed on this surface. In fact, the bridged carbonate configuration (stage 3a) shown in Figure 10(a) has been identified previously by other researchers as the result of CO adsorption to the stoichiometric ceria (110) surface.30,63 The reported energy of adsorption is −1.95 eV,63 which is slightly larger than the value of −1.89 eV determined in this study. The overall energy required for CO2 dissociation at an in-plane vacancy is +1.065 eV, which is quantitatively consistent with the reported results for CO oxidation on stoichiometric ceria (110).72,76–78

CO2 dissociation pathways on reduced ceria (110) with in-plane or split oxygen vacancy. (a) In-plane vacancy and (b) split vacancy.
The dissociation process initiated from the Rp5 adsorption configuration is depicted in Figure 10(b). The first step involves the Og2 atom of the bent CO2 molecule moving toward the surface and binding to the surface Ce site with excess electron spin density (stage 1b); we note that the other surface Ce site has already been re-oxidized during the CO2 adsorption step. For stage 2b, we observe the apparent shortening of the C–Og1 bond and the lengthening of the C–Og2 bond, due to additional charge transfer from the surface; this, we believe, represents a transition state in the formation of carbon monoxide (C=Og1). Also we note that two of the three oxygen atoms in the unidentate carbonate anion now bind to the same Ce atom, so we have formed an asymmetric bidentate carbonate structure. This step overcomes an energy barrier of +1.286 eV. In the second step, the C–Og2 bond is further elongated before finally breaking to form an adsorbed CO molecule, with the remaining Og2 left on the surface to heal the split vacancy. Since the Ce cation is more electrophilic than the saturated O anion, the CO molecule then diffuses from the (former) oxygen vacancy site to the surface Ce site. The calculated energy of desorption is −0.263 eV, which is comparable to the previously reported energy of desorption of −0.2 eV for CO on the stoichiometric ceria (110) surface.30 The overall energy required for CO2 dissociation at a split vacancy is +1.359 eV.
While CO2 dissociation at the split vacancy is less energetically favorable than the equivalent process at the in-plane vacancy, the path-independent overall energy of reaction is preserved when we consider that the formation of the split vacancy is more energetically favorable than the formation of the in-plane vacancy. We also note that the highest energy of activation for CO2 dissociation at the in-plane vacancy is +1.613 eV to form TS1, while the highest energy of activation for CO2 dissociation at the split vacancy is +1.359 eV to form TS2; thus, the rate-limiting steps for the respective dissociation pathways may differ and it appears that CO2 dissociation may be favored kinetically at the split vacancy even though it may be favored thermodynamically at the in-plane vacancy. However, when considering the process in reverse, the bridged carbonate (stage 3a) is very energetically stable, so CO oxidation may follow the in-plane vacancy pathway. Since all of the energies of activation appear to be quite high (i.e., +1.3 eV at a minimum, which is higher than Edes for CO2), it appears that one must add charge carriers, such as additional oxygen vacancies or even protons, to the catalyst surface to lower the energies of activation and achieve more efficient CO2 conversion at favorable operating conditions. This will be the subject of future investigations.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed analyses of structural geometries, electronic properties, and reaction energetics for carbon dioxide activation and dissociation on ceria (110) surfaces, using density functional theory with the Hubbard U correction. We find that the structure of the oxygen vacancy at the reduced surface plays an important role in the activation of CO2 on the ceria surface, and that the formation of the split vacancy is energetically favored over the in-plane vacancy by 0.311 eV. CO2 adsorption to reduced ceria (110) is energetically favored, particularly in the case of parallel CO2 adsorption atop the split oxygen vacancy, which has an energy of adsorption of −1.223 eV. This chemisorption process results in a bent CO2 molecule with an O–C–O angle of 136.9° and elongated C–O bonds compared to the gas-phase molecule. The Bader charge analysis confirms that a net charge of −0.955|e| is transferred from the reduced ceria (110) surface to the adsorbed CO2 molecule at the split vacancy, and a net charge of −0.923|e| is transferred to the adsorbed CO2 molecule at the in-plane vacancy. Thus, the CO2 molecule is activated at oxygen vacancies, following which the reduced ceria (110) surface is partially re-oxidized. When analyzing the elementary steps comprising CO2 dissociation at both types of oxygen vacancies, we find that: (1) On the in-plane vacancy, CO2 proceeds to first form an inorganic bidentate carboxylate, then a symmetric bridged carbonate, and finally CO, and (2) on the split vacancy, CO2 proceeds to first form a unidentate carbonate, then an asymmetric bidentate carbonate, and finally CO. The in-plane pathway has, for its purported rate-limiting step, an energy of activation of +1.613 eV and an overall reaction energy of +1.065 eV, while the split pathway has, for its purported rate-limiting step, an energy of activation of +1.359 eV and an overall reaction energy of +1.375 eV. These subtle differences in the energies of activation for the elementary steps suggest that CO2 dissociation is favored on the split vacancy, while the reverse process of CO oxidation may favor the formation of the in-plane vacancy. Reduced ceria (110) represents a promising catalyst for either thermal or electrochemical reduction of CO2 as the first step in the formation of fuels and chemicals as a means of closing of the carbon cycle.
