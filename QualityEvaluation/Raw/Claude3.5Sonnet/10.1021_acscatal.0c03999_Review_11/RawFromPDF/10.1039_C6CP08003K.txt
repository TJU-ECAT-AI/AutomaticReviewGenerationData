While natural gas is an abundant chemical fuel, its low volumetric energy density has 
prompted a search for catalysts able to transform methane into more useful chemicals. This 
search has often been aided through the use of transition state (TS) scaling relationships, 
which estimate methane activation TS energies as a linear function of a more easily 
calculated descriptor, such as final state energy, thus avoiding tedious transition state energy 
calculations.  It has been shown that methane can be activated via a radical or surface-
stabilized pathway, both of which possess a unique TS scaling relationship. Herein, we 
present a simple model to aid in the prediction of methane activation barriers on 
heterogeneous catalysts. Analogous to the universal radical TS scaling relationship 
introduced in a previous publication, we show that a universal TS scaling relationship that 
transcends catalysts classes also seems to exist for surface-stabilized methane activation if 
the relevant final state energy is used.  We demonstrate that this scaling relationship holds 
for several reducible and irreducible oxides, promoted metals, and sulfides.  By combining 
the universal scaling relationships for both radical and surface-stabilized methane activation 
pathways, we show that catalyst reactivity must be considered in addition to catalyst 
geometry to obtain an accurate estimation for the TS energy.  This model can yield fast and 
accurate predictions of methane activation barriers on a wide range of catalysts, thus 
accelerating the discovery of more active catalysts for methane conversion. 
It is estimated that approximately 200×10%& cubic meters of methane remain uncaptured 
in the earth’s crust1. If methane hydrates are included, the number could be as high as 15×10%( 
cubic meters1. Unfortunately, while abundant, methane is not an ideal source of chemical energy. 
Its low volumetric energy density often renders transportation from remote locations uneconomical 
and prevents it from being used widely as a transportation fuel2.  For these reasons, a vast body of 
research has focused on transforming methane into more energy dense fuels or higher value 
commodity chemicals3–8.  Irrespective of final product, these transformations all begin with 
methane activation—namely, the scission of one of the four carbon-hydrogen bonds.  Therefore, 
a thorough understanding of this initial step has the ability to inform research across the diverse 
field of methane oxidation.   
It has been shown previously that methane activation occurs via one of two possible 
pathways9: in the first, the methyl group is stabilized by the catalyst, while, in the second, a radical-
like intermediate is formed in which the methyl group is stabilized by the OH bond rather than the

surface10.  These two pathways lead to distinctly different transition state (TS) energy scaling 
behavior. TS scaling relationships generally describe the linear dependence of TS energies on more 
easily calculated descriptors, such as the energy of the final state or that of a key adsorbate.  These 
relationships facilitate first-pass catalyst screening by allowing a TS energy to be estimated before 
performing a resource-intensive barrier calculation. 
The methane activation TS energies of systems that proceed through a radical-like pathway 
scale with the hydrogen abstraction energy of the active site, EH
11,12, while the TS energies of 
metals and transition metal compounds that proceed through the surface-stabilized pathway scale 
with the final state energy, EFS
13,14. Therefore, it is important to understand which catalyst 
properties favor one pathway over the other so that the proper scaling relation may be used to 
estimate the TS energy.  Clearly, in catalysts with isolated active sites such as zeolites and other 
porous materials, the radical pathway will be favored due to the large distance between active sites.  
Similarly, as a surface-stabilized pathway intuitively seems more energetically favorable than the 
formation of a methyl radical, it has previously been assumed that catalysts with a high density of 
active sites, such as metals, will activate methane via methyl-surface stabilization15,16.  
Surprisingly, however, our findings suggest that this is not necessarily the case.  Herein, we 
demonstrate that reactivity must be considered in addition to catalyst structure to determine the 
lowest energy methane activation pathway. We show that catalysts that possess the appropriate 
geometry to activate methane via surface stabilization will prefer the radical pathway if the methyl 
binding energy is sufficiently low.  To address this, we find that both the universal radical12 and a 
surface-stabilized TS scaling relationship can be used to estimate two TS energies. The scaling 
relationship that gives the lower TS energy will correspond to the favored pathway, facilitating the 
prediction of methane activation barriers on a wide range of catalysts. 
To explore how the methane activation pathway depends on catalyst reactivity, we choose 
FCC (111) metals as a model system due to their prevalence in catalysis and their established 
ability to activate methane via the surface-stabilized pathway13,15. We examined oxygen promoted 
and clean surfaces, as each is relevant to methane activation under different conditions and on 
different metals15. To determine what catalyst electronic properties favor one pathway over the 
other, we calculated both the surface-stabilized and radical pathways on all surfaces. By setting 
the final state of the system to be either (O)H*+CH3(g) or (O)H*+CH3* (where there is an oxygen 
in the case of oxygen-promoted metals), we were able to isolate radical TSs even when the surface-

stabilized pathway was preferred. Initial, transition and final state example geometries are shown 
in Fig. 1. On non-promoted (clean) metal surfaces, no saddle point was found between the initial 
state, CH4(g), and the radical final state, CH3(g)+H*. Therefore, for these cases, we assume the 
radical TS is very final-state-like and approximate its energy to be that of the methyl radical, 
CH3(g)+H*.  A comprehensive list of all radical and surface-stabilized TS energies considered in 
this work are listed in Table S1.

and (b) surface-stabilized pathways 
 
Surprisingly, we find that the oxygen-promoted noble metals, Au and Ag, proceed through 
the radical-like TS regardless of the starting geometry for the calculation. Because a surface-
stabilized TS could not be isolated for these materials, it can be assumed that their preferred TS is 
radical-like.  This finding is significant because both Au and Ag have the appropriate geometry to 
proceed through the surface-stabilized pathway, implying that the preference of these noble metals

to proceed through a radical-like pathway must be due to their electronic structures.  While there 
is likely also a structural dependence if active centers for H stabilization and CH3 stabilization are 
far apart, this effect does not seem to be dominant on metal surfaces. Therefore, the preference of 
a catalyst to proceed through one pathway or the other will be governed by the relative energies of 
the corresponding TSs.  This conclusion can be visualized by plotting TS energies from both 
pathways as a function of EH. EH is defined analogously to a previous publication12 as:  
 
𝐸* = 𝐸(𝑀.𝑂0𝐻23%) −𝐸(𝑀.𝑂0𝐻2) 
 
 
(1) 
 
Where 𝐸(𝑀.𝑂0𝐻23%) and 𝐸(𝑀.𝑂0𝐻2) are the formation energies of the hydrogenated and 
dehydrogenated active sites, respectively, referenced to gas-phase H2O and O2.  As previously 
discussed, radical-like methane activation TS energies can be completely described by EH 
according to the linear scaling relationship in Eq. 2.  Alternatively, surface-stabilized TS energies 
are a linear function of EFS, which can be written as 𝐸6*7 + 𝐸*  in systems without strong 
adsorbate-adsorbate interactions (Eq. 3)13. If only metals are considered, surface-stabilized TS 
energies can also be projected directly onto EH due to the linear scaling that exists between ECH3 
and EH on metals (Fig. 2, Eq. 4-6)14
, where 𝛾 and 𝛿 will be different for O-promoted or clean 
surfaces.

Figure 2. Scaling of ECH3 and EH as a function of EC on O-Promoted FCC (111) metals 
 
 
Fig. 3 shows the TS energies calculated for both radical and surface-stabilized pathways 
on FCC (111) metals as a function of EH. As expected, all radical TSs (triangles) follow the 
universal radical TS scaling line (black).  Where the universal radical TS scaling line intersects the 
surface-stabilized TS scaling lines for oxygen-promoted (red) or clean (blue) metals, catalysts less 
reactive than the intersection point begin to favor the radical pathway as it now has the lower of 
the two TS energies.  The change in TS geometry for oxygen-promoted Au and Ag can therefore 
be fully attributed to the radical pathway having a lower TS energy than the surface-stabilized 
pathway on these surfaces.  The intersection of the radical and surface-stabilized scaling lines for 
a given class of materials determines where a “mechanistic switch” will occur.

filled shapes correspond to stable TS geometries.  
 
 
A noteworthy feature of Fig. 3 is the mirroring effect that arises when comparing oxygen-
promoted to clean metals. Namely, the oxygen-promoted noble catalysts have the most favorable 
EH, while the opposite is true for clean noble metals. This observation can be explained by 
considering the effect of a promoting species on a catalyst. A promoter on a reactive catalyst will 
be bound strongly and be relatively unreactive, while a promoter on a noble catalyst will be bound 
very weakly to the surface and thus be more reactive14,15. Therefore, the hydrogen abstraction 
energy of a clean gold surface will be unfavorable, whereas that of a weakly-bound, reactive 
oxygen atom adsorbed on gold will be favorable.  This idea points to another aspect of the plot 
that may be surprising to some researchers: the barriers for oxygen-promoted methane activation 
on the noble metals, gold and silver, are quite low, having nearly the same energy as the non-

promoted reactive metals, such as Pt and Pd.  Given the dearth of successful examples in which 
noble metal catalysts convert methane to useful products in the literature, such a finding may seem 
unexpected17.  However, this discrepancy can likely be attributed to the low oxygen coverages that 
exist at most relevant oxygen chemical potentials on noble metals due to their unfavorable 
formation energies18. It should also be noted that a more stable radical TS does not imply the final 
state will include a methyl radical; even on Ag and Au, CH3* is approximately 0.8 eV more stable 
than a gas-phase radical. 
 
The near-zero slope of the surface-stabilized O-promoted metals can be explained by a 
bond-order conservation argument.  As mentioned previously, the TS energy scales with ECH3+EH. 
ECH3 scales has a slope of ¼ when plotted against EC, since three of four possible bonds are already 
saturated (Fig. 2) 19. EH, on the other hand, scales with EC with a slope of -¼, the origins for which 
is discussed in greater detail in the SI (Fig. 2)14. Therefore, ECH3 + EH is effectivity constant for O-
promoted metals, leading to a case where the TS energy varies little as a function of EH. 
While the idea that a methyl radical TS would be more stable than a surface-stabilized TS 
initially seems unintuitive, Fig. 3 remarkably shows a region where the interaction of the methyl 
group with the catalyst surface destabilizes the TS.  In this region, noble metals drop to the 
universal radical scaling line and energetically favor the radical pathway.  It is worth noting that 
the surface-stabilized TS scaling relation estimates the TS to be on the order of 1 eV higher than 
the true, radical-like TS. Therefore, surprisingly, it is not sufficient to assume methane activation 
will occur via the surface-stabilized pathway, even if the catalyst has the appropriate structure to 
do so.   
Unfortunately, many other interesting catalyst materials, such as oxides, do not exhibit 
reliable scaling between ECH3 and EH and therefore cannot be visualized in the same way as the 
metals shown in Fig. 3. However, these materials do follow the universal radical scaling12 (Fig. 4a) 
if methane is activated via the radical-like pathway. Additionally, all materials we explored that 
proceed through the surface-stabilized pathway, including promoted metals, sulfides, and oxides, 
seem to follow the previously-established TS scaling relationship for CHx activation on 111 and 
211 metals as shown in Fig. 4b13,14.  The apparent universality of surface-stabilized TS scaling 
implies that these two “universal” scaling relationships can now be used to describe heterogeneous 
methane activation nearly comprehensively.  In other words, for any system with the appropriate

tested using these two scaling relationships. If a TS energy is calculated for both pathways using 
the corresponding scaling relationships, the lower of the two energies will be:

appropriate geometry for surface-stabilized CH4 activation will automatically be described by the 
universal radical scaling line12, this approach facilitates the prediction of methane activation 
barriers on nearly any catalyst.

There are several noteworthy aspects of Fig. 4b. First, it should be clarified that the FS 
energies of insulating systems include adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. In other words, the 
independent variable for these points is EH+CH3 rather than EH+ECH3.  The reason for this distinction 
lies in the localized nature of adsorption on insulators.  In these systems, intermediates’ adsorption 
energies are significantly altered in the presence of other adsorbed species20.  Adsorbate-adsorbate 
interactions will also to a lesser degree affect the scaling of the other catalyst classes in Fig. 4b, 
but these deviations are not regarded as significant for metallic systems.  Fig. 4b also exhibits 
minimal variation in both the domain and range of O-promoted metals.  This observation can be 
rationalized by considering the equal and opposite scaling of EH and ECH3 in O-promoted metals, 
as discussed earlier (Fig. 2). Because ECH3 will exactly compensate any changes in EH and vice 
versa, the independent variable, EFS, is effectively constant for all surfaces.  A final note on Fig. 
4b relates to the catalyst whose TS energy is seemingly less than zero.  This effect can be 
understood by recognizing that several of the oxides studied herein bind methane relatively 
strongly (~0.5 eV), so that if the methane dissociation barrier on these oxides is sufficiently low, 
the TS energy will be negative when referenced to gas-phase methane. If the reference were instead 
CH4*, small but positive TS energies would be observed.  
The model given by Eq. 7 can be visualized in a 2D plot as shown in Fig. 5a, where the 
two independent descriptors, EH and EFS, fully describe the TS energy.  The black line marks EH 
and EF values where the “mechanistic switch” will occur; points to its left will be radically 
activated, and points to its right will be surface-stabilized.  Fig. 5b shows the accuracy of using Eq. 
7 to predict TS energies compared to the corresponding DFT transition state energies. Notably, 
only two energies, EFS and EH, are needed to predict TS energies for many catalysts with an 
MAE=0.24 eV. The success of this model in describing metals, promoted metals, metallic and 
insulating oxides, and sulfides suggests that it can be used with confidence to assess the reactivity 
of many new potential methane activation catalysts. Using this model as a first-pass assessment 
will allow the user to determine the most likely TS geometry and energy for methane activation. 
This knowledge can be used to optimize initial guesses in a full barrier calculation or stand alone 
as an accurate estimation of the TS energy on nearly any catalyst.

Figure 5. Model for predicting methane activation TS energies as given by Eq. 7. (A) ETS as a function of 
two independent descriptors, EFS and EH. The equation of the black line is EFS = 1.12EH + 0.07, which marks 
the points where the two scaling relationships predict equal TS energies. (B) Accuracy of model prediction 
compared to DFT-calculated TSs (MAE=0.24, maximum absolute error: 0.41 eV). Full circles are surface-
stabilized transition states, and half-filled circles are radical transition states. 
 
To determine the applicability of this model to catalysts with less traditional geometries 
than examined thus far, we decided to explore methane activation on the catalyst shown in Fig. 6a, 
which we refer to as O@Ca@O@MoS2. On a MoS2 slab with sulfur vacancies, exposure to oxygen 
would fill these vacancies resulting in O@MoS2. The slight electronegativity difference between 
oxygen and sulfur would lead any calcium ions doped into the system to migrate to oxygen sites 
(Ca@O@MoS2), and further exposure to oxygen would lead to oxygen adsorption on the calcium 
ion resulting in the final active site. A surface-stabilized TS was isolated (Fig. 6b), in which the 
methyl is stabilized on the same calcium to which to H-abstracting oxygen is bound.  This unusual 
TS geometry followed the SS scaling line well, as shown in Fig. 6d.  However, when provided EH 
and EFS for this active site, the model suggested a more energetically favorable radical-like TS 
existed.  Indeed, this radical-like TS was isolated and found to have a lower energy (Fig. 6c). The 
success of the model in describing methane activation on this unusual active site demonstrates its 
potential to accurately describe a wide range of catalyst materials.

Figure 6. The model extended to a less traditional active site geometry, O@Ca@O@MoS2. Here, (a) is the 
active site before methane activation, (b) is the TS for the SS pathway, (c) is the TS for the radical-like 
pathway, and (d) shows the good agreement of the SS TS with its corresponding scaling relationship. In all 
subfigures, atom colors are as follows: S: yellow; Mo: purple; Ca: blue; O: red; C: grey; H: red. 
 
Previously, we noted that the model described herein should only be applied to catalysts in 
which the surface-stabilized pathway is geometrically accessible. This is a logical conclusion when 
considering the extreme example of porous materials, such as zeolites, with distances between 
active sites on the order of tens or hundreds of angstroms. Regardless of how energetically 
favorable the CH3 binding energy might be, sites that are too far apart will not be able to aid in 
stabilization of the TS.  However, this analysis prompts the following question: at what distance 
between active sites does the surface-stabilization become possible? Herein, we have underscored 
previously-established data15 showing that a distance of ~2 Å between H* and CH3* in the final 
state of methane activation on clean FCC (111) metals is small enough for surface stabilization to 
take place. However, we find that stabilization does not occur on oxygen-covered rutile oxides, 
where H* and CH3* in the FS are separated by ~3	  Å, even in cases where CH3 binding is very 
favorable (Fig. S1).  This suggests, as one might expect, that there is a tradeoff between 
stabilization energy gained by the methyl group interacting with the surface and the unfavorable 
energy of stretching the C-H bond too far in the TS. Interestingly, this distance dependence is not 
seen on active sites where an acid-base pair is present.  For example, methane is activated via the

surface-stabilized pathway over an Ob and a Mc on 110 oxide surfaces, even though the distance 
between these active sites is again ~3	  Å (Fig. S2). This may be rationalized by arguing that the 
heterolytic bond cleavage favored by acid-base pairs will be governed by more long-range ionic 
interactions than the homolytic cleavage that occurs when no acid-base pair is present to polarize 
the bond21.  Hence, in order to highlight situations where caution should be taken when predicting 
pathways and barriers for methane activation, we present a simple flowchart (Fig. 7).

While the distance dependence of homolytic C-H bond cleavage has not yet been quantified, 
the model presented herein can nevertheless be applied with confidence to active sites that fall in 
the predictable regions of the flowchart or those with structures that have previously been shown 
to activate methane via the surface-stabilized pathway.   
We have demonstrated the existence of a second universal TS scaling relationship for the 
surface-stabilized methane activation pathway. By combining this with the previously described 
universal radical TS scaling12, we formulated a simple model to predict which pathway will be 
preferred to activate methane on a given catalyst site, facilitating the subsequent use of the correct 
scaling relationship.  This model elucidates the need to consider catalyst electronic structure in

Methods: 
The plane wave QuantumEspresso code and Bayesian Error Estimation Functional with Van der Waals 
corrections (BEEF-vdw) functional was used for the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 
plane-wave cutoff and density cutoff were 500 eV and 5000 eV, respectively. Forces on all atoms were 
minimized to 0.05 eV Å-1.  For rutile (110) oxides, MgO (110), FCC (111) metals, and doped MoS2, a 
(6,6,1), (4,4,1), (4,4,1), or (2,2,1) k-point sampling was employed on a 2x1, 4x2, 3x3, or 3x4 expansion of 
the surface unit cell.  Metal and oxide slabs were composed of four stoichiometric layers separated by 15 
Å vaccum; the lowest 2 layers were kept fixed to simulate the bulk. For doped MoS2 geometries, the sulfur 
atoms in bottom of the 2D network were fixed. For each active site motif and material category, a Climbing-
Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB)22 calculation was performed to determine the location of the 
transition state (TS). Adsorption energies were referenced to gas-phase O2, CH4, and H2O.
