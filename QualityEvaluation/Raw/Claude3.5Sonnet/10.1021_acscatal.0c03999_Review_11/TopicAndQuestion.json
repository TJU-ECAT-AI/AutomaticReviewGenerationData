    "QuestionEnglish": "Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.",
    "QuestionChinese": "描述并比较用于选择性地将丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法，包括卤素脱氢、氧化脱氢、氧卤化和熔融金属卤化物盐方法。解释每种方法的反应条件，并分析为什么丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与其他烷烃（如甲烷和乙烷）有显著差异。"
