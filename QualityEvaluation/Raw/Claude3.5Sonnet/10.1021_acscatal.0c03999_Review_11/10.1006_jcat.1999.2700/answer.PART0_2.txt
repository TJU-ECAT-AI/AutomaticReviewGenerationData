[1] "The introduction of small partial pressures of TCM increases the conversion of propane with selectivities to propene up to 80%."

[2] "With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."

[3] "To provide ancillary information on the role of TCM in the oxidation of propane the catalyst was exposed to a mixture of C3H8, O2 and various partial pressures of TCM diluted with helium at 723 K for 6 h prior to the introduction of the reactant stream not containing TCM"

[4] "In contrast, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with which the earlier results for the oxides of Sm, La, and Pr showed that the introduction of TCM had little or no effect (20), the present work demonstrates that with CeO2 substantial increases of both the conversion of propane and selectivity to C3H6 are observed on addition of TCM to the feedstream."

The literature primarily focuses on tetrachloromethane (TCM)-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over cerium oxide catalysts. It does not provide comprehensive information on various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

1. TCM-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation: This method involves adding small amounts of TCM to the feedstream containing propane and oxygen, with cerium oxide as the catalyst. The reaction is typically carried out at 723 K. This approach significantly increases propane conversion and selectivity to propene, with selectivities up to 80%.

2. TCM-assisted dehydrogenation without oxygen: In the absence of oxygen but with TCM present, some propane conversion (0.8%) was observed, with 71% selectivity to propene. This suggests that TCM can act as an oxidant in the absence of oxygen.

3. Catalyst pretreatment with TCM: Exposing the cerium oxide catalyst to a mixture of propane, oxygen, and TCM prior to the reaction improved propene selectivity and decreased CO2 formation in subsequent reactions without TCM.

The literature does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs from methane and ethane. While TCM addition enhances propane conversion and propene selectivity on cerium oxide, it has little effect on methane conversion to C2+ hydrocarbons on the same catalyst. This difference in reactivity may be due to the varying bond strengths and activation energies required for breaking C-H bonds in different alkanes.

该文献主要关注四氯化碳(TCM)辅助的氧化脱氢反应，以氧化铈为催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯。它没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的各种卤素辅助方法的全面信息。但根据可用信息：

1. TCM辅助氧化脱氢：这种方法涉及向含有丙烷和氧气的进料流中添加少量TCM，以氧化铈为催化剂。反应通常在723 K下进行。这种方法显著提高了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性，丙烯选择性可达80%。

2. 无氧条件下的TCM辅助脱氢：在无氧但有TCM存在的情况下，观察到少量丙烷转化（0.8%），丙烯选择性为71%。这表明在无氧条件下，TCM可以作为氧化剂。

3. TCM预处理催化剂：在反应前将氧化铈催化剂暴露于丙烷、氧气和TCM的混合物中，可以改善后续无TCM反应中的丙烯选择性并降低CO2的生成。

文献没有提供关于卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法用于丙烷脱氢的信息。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同。在氧化铈上，TCM的添加增强了丙烷的转化和丙烯的选择性，但对于同一催化剂上甲烷转化为C2+烃的反应几乎没有影响。这种反应性的差异可能是由于不同烷烃中C-H键断裂所需的键强度和活化能不同。
