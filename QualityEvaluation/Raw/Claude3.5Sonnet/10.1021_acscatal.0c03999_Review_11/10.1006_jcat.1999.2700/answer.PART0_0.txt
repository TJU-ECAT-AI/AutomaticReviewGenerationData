[1] "More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."

[2] "The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the introduction of TCM to the feedstream."

[3] "On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conversion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2, although more substantially at the lower values of the latter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly increased."

[4] "With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."

The literature primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide as a catalyst, with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive. This method falls under the category of halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation.

Reaction conditions: The experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure and 723 K. The feed consisted of propane, oxygen, and varying amounts of TCM diluted with helium.

The addition of TCM significantly improved both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propene. Without TCM, CO2 was the principal product. With TCM, propene selectivity increased up to 80%.

The literature does not provide detailed information on other halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation, such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches.

Regarding the difference in reactivity between propane and other alkanes, the literature mentions that for methane oxidation on cerium oxide, the addition of TCM had no positive effect, producing only carbon oxides. In contrast, for propane, TCM addition significantly improved both conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that propane's reactivity in these processes differs from that of methane, possibly due to its longer carbon chain and different C-H bond strengths.

The literature does not provide enough information to make a comprehensive comparison of propane's reactivity to that of ethane in these processes.

该文献主要关注使用氧化铈作为催化剂，四氯甲烷（TCM）作为气相添加剂的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。这种方法属于卤素辅助氧化脱氢的范畴。

反应条件：实验在固定床连续流动石英反应器中进行，在大气压和723 K的温度下进行。进料由丙烷、氧气和不同量的TCM组成，用氦气稀释。

添加TCM显著提高了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性。没有TCM时，CO2是主要产物。加入TCM后，丙烯选择性提高到80%。

文献没有提供其他卤素辅助丙烷脱氢方法的详细信息，如卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。

关于丙烷与其他烷烃反应性的差异，文献提到对于氧化铈上的甲烷氧化，添加TCM没有积极效果，只产生碳氧化物。相比之下，对于丙烷，添加TCM显著提高了转化率和丙烯选择性。这表明丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷不同，可能是由于其较长的碳链和不同的C-H键强度。

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较丙烷与乙烷在这些过程中的反应性。
