[1] "Relatively little work has been reported on the use of gas-phase additives in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the introduction of TCM to the feedstream."

[3] "On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conversion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2, although more substantially at the lower values of the latter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly increased."

[4] "To provide further information on the catalytic properties of CeO2 experiments in the absence of O2 were performed. With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."

[5] "The addition of a partial pressure of TCM equal to 0.085 kPa produces a conversion approximately twice that observed in its absence and an increase in the C2 + C3 selectivity by more than a factor of three with concomitant decreases in the selectivities to carbon oxides"

The literature primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide as a catalyst, with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive. This method shows significant improvements in propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to oxidative dehydrogenation without TCM.

Key findings include:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation with TCM: Adding TCM (0.17 kPa) increased propane conversion and C3H6 selectivity across all O2 partial pressures tested.

2. Dehydrogenation with TCM only: In the absence of O2, TCM alone caused 0.8% propane conversion with 71% selectivity to C3H6.

3. Optimal TCM concentration: A partial pressure of 0.085 kPa TCM doubled propane conversion and tripled C2+C3 selectivity compared to no TCM.

The document does not provide detailed information on other halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation, such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also doesn't extensively compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

However, the study does note that propane behaves differently from methane in these reactions. While rare earth oxides (including cerium oxide) with TCM improve methane conversion to C2+ hydrocarbons, only cerium oxide shows significant improvement for propane conversion to propene when TCM is added.

The reaction conditions described involve a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure, typically operated at 723 K. The feed usually consisted of propane, oxygen, and TCM in varying partial pressures, diluted with helium.

Overall, the study demonstrates that the addition of TCM significantly enhances the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on cerium oxide catalysts, but does not provide comprehensive comparisons to other halogen-assisted methods or extensive analysis of propane's unique reactivity compared to other alkanes.

这篇文献主要关注使用氧化铈作为催化剂，四氯甲烷（TCM）作为气相添加剂的丙烷氧化脱氢方法。与不添加TCM的氧化脱氢相比，这种方法显著提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

主要发现包括：

1. 含TCM的氧化脱氢：添加TCM（0.17 kPa）在所有测试的O2分压下都增加了丙烷转化率和C3H6选择性。

2. 仅用TCM脱氢：在没有O2的情况下，单独使用TCM导致0.8%的丙烷转化，其中71%选择性生成C3H6。

3. 最佳TCM浓度：0.085 kPa的TCM分压使丙烷转化率翻倍，C2+C3选择性增加三倍（相比于不添加TCM）。

文献没有提供其他卤素辅助丙烷脱氢方法的详细信息，如卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐法。它也没有广泛比较丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷或乙烷的差异。

然而，研究确实指出丙烷在这些反应中的行为与甲烷不同。虽然稀土氧化物（包括氧化铈）与TCM可以改善甲烷转化为C2+烃，但只有氧化铈在添加TCM时显著改善了丙烷转化为丙烯的效果。

所描述的反应条件涉及大气压下的固定床连续流石英反应器，通常在723 K下操作。进料通常由丙烷、氧气和TCM以不同分压组成，用氦气稀释。

总的来说，该研究表明，在氧化铈催化剂上添加TCM显著增强了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢，但没有提供与其他卤素辅助方法的全面比较，也没有广泛分析丙烷与其他烷烃相比的独特反应活性。
