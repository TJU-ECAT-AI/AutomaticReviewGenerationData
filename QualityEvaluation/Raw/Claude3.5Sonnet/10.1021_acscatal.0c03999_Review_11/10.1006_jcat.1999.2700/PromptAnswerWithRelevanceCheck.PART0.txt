[1] "More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."

[2] "The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the introduction of TCM to the feedstream."

[3] "On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conversion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2, although more substantially at the lower values of the latter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly increased."

[4] "With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."

The literature primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide as a catalyst, with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive. This method falls under the category of halogen-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation.

Reaction conditions: The experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure and 723 K. The feed consisted of propane, oxygen, and varying amounts of TCM diluted with helium.

The addition of TCM significantly improved both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propene. Without TCM, CO2 was the principal product. With TCM, propene selectivity increased up to 80%.

The literature does not provide detailed information on other halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation, such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches.

Regarding the difference in reactivity between propane and other alkanes, the literature mentions that for methane oxidation on cerium oxide, the addition of TCM had no positive effect, producing only carbon oxides. In contrast, for propane, TCM addition significantly improved both conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that propane's reactivity in these processes differs from that of methane, possibly due to its longer carbon chain and different C-H bond strengths.

The literature does not provide enough information to make a comprehensive comparison of propane's reactivity to that of ethane in these processes.

该文献主要关注使用氧化铈作为催化剂，四氯甲烷（TCM）作为气相添加剂的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。这种方法属于卤素辅助氧化脱氢的范畴。

反应条件：实验在固定床连续流动石英反应器中进行，在大气压和723 K的温度下进行。进料由丙烷、氧气和不同量的TCM组成，用氦气稀释。

添加TCM显著提高了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性。没有TCM时，CO2是主要产物。加入TCM后，丙烯选择性提高到80%。

文献没有提供其他卤素辅助丙烷脱氢方法的详细信息，如卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。

关于丙烷与其他烷烃反应性的差异，文献提到对于氧化铈上的甲烷氧化，添加TCM没有积极效果，只产生碳氧化物。相比之下，对于丙烷，添加TCM显著提高了转化率和丙烯选择性。这表明丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷不同，可能是由于其较长的碳链和不同的C-H键强度。

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较丙烷与乙烷在这些过程中的反应性。

The literature primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide as a catalyst, with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive. This method shows significant improvements in propane conversion and propene selectivity compared to oxidative dehydrogenation without TCM.

Key findings include:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation with TCM: Adding TCM (0.17 kPa) increased propane conversion and C3H6 selectivity across all O2 partial pressures tested.

2. Dehydrogenation with TCM only: In the absence of O2, TCM alone caused 0.8% propane conversion with 71% selectivity to C3H6.

3. Optimal TCM concentration: A partial pressure of 0.085 kPa TCM doubled propane conversion and tripled C2+C3 selectivity compared to no TCM.

The document does not provide detailed information on other halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation, such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches. It also doesn't extensively compare propane's reactivity to that of methane or ethane in these processes.

However, the study does note that propane behaves differently from methane in these reactions. While rare earth oxides (including cerium oxide) with TCM improve methane conversion to C2+ hydrocarbons, only cerium oxide shows significant improvement for propane conversion to propene when TCM is added.

The reaction conditions described involve a fixed-bed continuous-flow quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure, typically operated at 723 K. The feed usually consisted of propane, oxygen, and TCM in varying partial pressures, diluted with helium.

Overall, the study demonstrates that the addition of TCM significantly enhances the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on cerium oxide catalysts, but does not provide comprehensive comparisons to other halogen-assisted methods or extensive analysis of propane's unique reactivity compared to other alkanes.

这篇文献主要关注使用氧化铈作为催化剂，四氯甲烷（TCM）作为气相添加剂的丙烷氧化脱氢方法。与不添加TCM的氧化脱氢相比，这种方法显著提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

主要发现包括：

1. 含TCM的氧化脱氢：添加TCM（0.17 kPa）在所有测试的O2分压下都增加了丙烷转化率和C3H6选择性。

2. 仅用TCM脱氢：在没有O2的情况下，单独使用TCM导致0.8%的丙烷转化，其中71%选择性生成C3H6。

3. 最佳TCM浓度：0.085 kPa的TCM分压使丙烷转化率翻倍，C2+C3选择性增加三倍（相比于不添加TCM）。

文献没有提供其他卤素辅助丙烷脱氢方法的详细信息，如卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐法。它也没有广泛比较丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷或乙烷的差异。

然而，研究确实指出丙烷在这些反应中的行为与甲烷不同。虽然稀土氧化物（包括氧化铈）与TCM可以改善甲烷转化为C2+烃，但只有氧化铈在添加TCM时显著改善了丙烷转化为丙烯的效果。

所描述的反应条件涉及大气压下的固定床连续流石英反应器，通常在723 K下操作。进料通常由丙烷、氧气和TCM以不同分压组成，用氦气稀释。

总的来说，该研究表明，在氧化铈催化剂上添加TCM显著增强了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢，但没有提供与其他卤素辅助方法的全面比较，也没有广泛分析丙烷与其他烷烃相比的独特反应活性。

The literature primarily focuses on tetrachloromethane (TCM)-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over cerium oxide catalysts. It does not provide comprehensive information on various halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

1. TCM-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation: This method involves adding small amounts of TCM to the feedstream containing propane and oxygen, with cerium oxide as the catalyst. The reaction is typically carried out at 723 K. This approach significantly increases propane conversion and selectivity to propene, with selectivities up to 80%.

2. TCM-assisted dehydrogenation without oxygen: In the absence of oxygen but with TCM present, some propane conversion (0.8%) was observed, with 71% selectivity to propene. This suggests that TCM can act as an oxidant in the absence of oxygen.

3. Catalyst pretreatment with TCM: Exposing the cerium oxide catalyst to a mixture of propane, oxygen, and TCM prior to the reaction improved propene selectivity and decreased CO2 formation in subsequent reactions without TCM.

The literature does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs from methane and ethane. While TCM addition enhances propane conversion and propene selectivity on cerium oxide, it has little effect on methane conversion to C2+ hydrocarbons on the same catalyst. This difference in reactivity may be due to the varying bond strengths and activation energies required for breaking C-H bonds in different alkanes.

该文献主要关注四氯化碳(TCM)辅助的氧化脱氢反应，以氧化铈为催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯。它没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的各种卤素辅助方法的全面信息。但根据可用信息：

1. TCM辅助氧化脱氢：这种方法涉及向含有丙烷和氧气的进料流中添加少量TCM，以氧化铈为催化剂。反应通常在723 K下进行。这种方法显著提高了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性，丙烯选择性可达80%。

2. 无氧条件下的TCM辅助脱氢：在无氧但有TCM存在的情况下，观察到少量丙烷转化（0.8%），丙烯选择性为71%。这表明在无氧条件下，TCM可以作为氧化剂。

3. TCM预处理催化剂：在反应前将氧化铈催化剂暴露于丙烷、氧气和TCM的混合物中，可以改善后续无TCM反应中的丙烯选择性并降低CO2的生成。

文献没有提供关于卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法用于丙烷脱氢的信息。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同。在氧化铈上，TCM的添加增强了丙烷的转化和丙烯的选择性，但对于同一催化剂上甲烷转化为C2+烃的反应几乎没有影响。这种反应性的差异可能是由于不同烷烃中C-H键断裂所需的键强度和活化能不同。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. However, it does discuss the use of tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over cerium oxide.

The study shows that the addition of TCM significantly improves both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propene. Without TCM, no conversion of propane was observed in the absence of oxygen. With TCM, even without oxygen, there was a small conversion of propane (0.8%) with high selectivity to propene (71%).

In oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, the addition of TCM approximately doubled the conversion of propane and tripled the selectivity to C2 and C3 products compared to reactions without TCM.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs from methane and ethane. For methane, rare earth oxides of Sm, La, and Pr were effective in producing C2+ hydrocarbons, while cerium oxide only produced carbon oxides. However, for propane, cerium oxide with TCM showed substantial improvements in conversion and selectivity, while the other rare earth oxides showed little effect with TCM.

The study does not provide information on other halogen-assisted methods such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation. Further research would be needed to comprehensively compare these methods.

该文献并未提供各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的全面比较。然而，它确实讨论了四氯化碳(TCM)作为气相添加剂在氧化脱氢丙烷过程中对氧化铈的影响。

研究表明，添加TCM显著提高了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性。在没有TCM的情况下，无氧条件下没有观察到丙烷转化。而有TCM时，即使在无氧条件下，也有少量丙烷转化(0.8%)，且对丙烯有较高的选择性(71%)。

在氧化脱氢条件下，添加TCM使丙烷的转化率大约翻倍，C2和C3产物的选择性比不添加TCM时增加了三倍。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同。对于甲烷，Sm、La和Pr的稀土氧化物能有效地生成C2+烃，而氧化铈只产生碳氧化物。然而，对于丙烷，添加TCM的氧化铈显示出转化率和选择性的显著改善，而其他稀土氧化物添加TCM后效果不明显。

该研究没有提供其他卤素辅助方法的信息，如卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐法进行丙烷脱氢。需要进一步的研究才能全面比较这些方法。

[1] "Heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane typically contain vanadium and magnesium as the critical elements (1-4)."

[2] "Both gas- and solid-phase additives have been examined for alkane oxidation processes, in particular those involving methane (13-19)."

[3] "Early studies on the oxidation of methane have shown that the introduction of a halomethane improves the selectivity to formaldehyde on supported palladium and platinum catalysts (13, 14) and higher selectivities to C2+ hydrocarbons have been reported on Na/Mn/SiO2 catalysts in the presence of gaseous CH3Cl or HCl (15)."

[4] "Work in one of our laboratories has found that the addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) increases the yield of formaldehyde on heteropolyoxometalates in the partial oxidation of methane (16) and of C2 hydrocarbons in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) on a variety of silica-supported oxides (17)."

[5] "More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."

The literature primarily focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide catalyst with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as an additive. It does not provide comprehensive information on all halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation with halogen additives:
- Cerium oxide is used as a catalyst.
- Small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane (TCM) are added to the feedstream.
- Reaction conditions involve propane, oxygen, and TCM at 723 K.
- This method increases both propane conversion and selectivity to propene.

2. Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM):
- Catalysts like Pr6O11 and silica-supported oxides are used.
- TCM is added to the feedstream.
- This method improves C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane:
- Catalysts such as CeO2 and Pr6O11 are used.
- Small partial pressures of TCM are added to the feedstream.
- This method benefits from TCM addition.

The literature does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane.

Propane's reactivity differs from methane and ethane in these processes. While TCM addition improves C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity in methane oxidation and benefits ethane dehydrogenation, its effect on propane is more pronounced. For propane, TCM addition significantly increases both conversion and propene selectivity on cerium oxide catalyst, which is not observed for methane on the same catalyst.

The differences in reactivity may be due to the molecular structure and bond strengths of propane compared to methane and ethane, as well as the specific interactions between the catalyst, TCM, and the different alkanes. However, the literature does not provide a detailed explanation for these differences.

- 在进料流中添加TCM。
- 这种方法提高了C2+烃类的选择性。

3. 乙烷的氧化脱氢：

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同。虽然TCM的添加改善了甲烷氧化中C2+烃类的选择性，并有利于乙烷脱氢，但它对丙烷的影响更为显著。对于丙烷，TCM的添加在氧化铈催化剂上显著提高了转化率和丙烯选择性，这在同一催化剂上的甲烷反应中并未观察到。

反应性的差异可能是由于丙烷与甲烷和乙烷相比的分子结构和键强度不同，以及催化剂、TCM和不同烷烃之间的特定相互作用。然而，文献并未对这些差异提供详细解释。
