[1] "Heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane typically contain vanadium and magnesium as the critical elements (1-4)."

[2] "Both gas- and solid-phase additives have been examined for alkane oxidation processes, in particular those involving methane (13-19)."

[3] "Early studies on the oxidation of methane have shown that the introduction of a halomethane improves the selectivity to formaldehyde on supported palladium and platinum catalysts (13, 14) and higher selectivities to C2+ hydrocarbons have been reported on Na/Mn/SiO2 catalysts in the presence of gaseous CH3Cl or HCl (15)."

[4] "Work in one of our laboratories has found that the addition of tetrachloromethane (TCM) increases the yield of formaldehyde on heteropolyoxometalates in the partial oxidation of methane (16) and of C2 hydrocarbons in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) on a variety of silica-supported oxides (17)."

[5] "More recently, the OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream."

[6] "The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the introduction of TCM to the feedstream."

[7] "On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conversion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2, although more substantially at the lower values of the latter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly increased."

The literature primarily focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using cerium oxide catalyst with tetrachloromethane (TCM) as an additive. It does not provide comprehensive information on all halogen-assisted methods for propane dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation with halogen additives:
- Cerium oxide is used as a catalyst.
- Small partial pressures of tetrachloromethane (TCM) are added to the feedstream.
- Reaction conditions involve propane, oxygen, and TCM at 723 K.
- This method increases both propane conversion and selectivity to propene.

2. Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM):
- Catalysts like Pr6O11 and silica-supported oxides are used.
- TCM is added to the feedstream.
- This method improves C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane:
- Catalysts such as CeO2 and Pr6O11 are used.
- Small partial pressures of TCM are added to the feedstream.
- This method benefits from TCM addition.

The literature does not provide information on dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane.

Propane's reactivity differs from methane and ethane in these processes. While TCM addition improves C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity in methane oxidation and benefits ethane dehydrogenation, its effect on propane is more pronounced. For propane, TCM addition significantly increases both conversion and propene selectivity on cerium oxide catalyst, which is not observed for methane on the same catalyst.

The differences in reactivity may be due to the molecular structure and bond strengths of propane compared to methane and ethane, as well as the specific interactions between the catalyst, TCM, and the different alkanes. However, the literature does not provide a detailed explanation for these differences.

该文献主要集中于使用氧化铈催化剂和四氯甲烷（TCM）作为添加剂进行丙烷的氧化脱氢。它没有提供所有卤素辅助丙烷脱氢方法的全面信息。但是，根据可用信息：

1. 卤素添加剂辅助的氧化脱氢：
- 使用氧化铈作为催化剂。
- 在进料流中添加少量四氯甲烷（TCM）。
- 反应条件包括丙烷、氧气和TCM，温度为723 K。
- 这种方法同时提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

2. 甲烷氧化偶联（OCM）：
- 使用Pr6O11和硅支撑的氧化物等催化剂。
- 在进料流中添加TCM。
- 这种方法提高了C2+烃类的选择性。

3. 乙烷的氧化脱氢：
- 使用CeO2和Pr6O11等催化剂。
- 在进料流中添加少量TCM。
- 这种方法受益于TCM的添加。

文献没有提供关于卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法用于丙烷的信息。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同。虽然TCM的添加改善了甲烷氧化中C2+烃类的选择性，并有利于乙烷脱氢，但它对丙烷的影响更为显著。对于丙烷，TCM的添加在氧化铈催化剂上显著提高了转化率和丙烯选择性，这在同一催化剂上的甲烷反应中并未观察到。

反应性的差异可能是由于丙烷与甲烷和乙烷相比的分子结构和键强度不同，以及催化剂、TCM和不同烷烃之间的特定相互作用。然而，文献并未对这些差异提供详细解释。
