[1] "With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively, were measured."

[2] "The addition of a partial pressure of TCM equal to 0.085 kPa produces a conversion approximately twice that observed in its absence and an increase in the C2 + C3 selectivity by more than a factor of three with concomitant decreases in the selectivities to carbon oxides"

[3] "In contrast, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with which the earlier results for the oxides of Sm, La, and Pr showed that the introduction of TCM had little or no effect (20), the present work demonstrates that with CeO2 substantial increases of both the conversion of propane and selectivity to C3H6 are observed on addition of TCM to the feedstream."

[4] "The rare earth oxides of Sm, La, and Pr catalyze the conversion of methane to form C2+ hydrocarbons with significant selectivities (9, 10, 21). In contrast only the carbon oxides are produced from methane with cerium oxide."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene. However, it does discuss the use of tetrachloromethane (TCM) as a gas-phase additive in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over cerium oxide.

The study shows that the addition of TCM significantly improves both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propene. Without TCM, no conversion of propane was observed in the absence of oxygen. With TCM, even without oxygen, there was a small conversion of propane (0.8%) with high selectivity to propene (71%).

In oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, the addition of TCM approximately doubled the conversion of propane and tripled the selectivity to C2 and C3 products compared to reactions without TCM.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs from methane and ethane. For methane, rare earth oxides of Sm, La, and Pr were effective in producing C2+ hydrocarbons, while cerium oxide only produced carbon oxides. However, for propane, cerium oxide with TCM showed substantial improvements in conversion and selectivity, while the other rare earth oxides showed little effect with TCM.

The study does not provide information on other halogen-assisted methods such as dehydrogenation with halogens, oxyhalogenation, or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation. Further research would be needed to comprehensively compare these methods.

该文献并未提供各种卤素辅助方法选择性脱氢丙烷制丙烯的全面比较。然而，它确实讨论了四氯化碳(TCM)作为气相添加剂在氧化脱氢丙烷过程中对氧化铈的影响。

研究表明，添加TCM显著提高了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性。在没有TCM的情况下，无氧条件下没有观察到丙烷转化。而有TCM时，即使在无氧条件下，也有少量丙烷转化(0.8%)，且对丙烯有较高的选择性(71%)。

在氧化脱氢条件下，添加TCM使丙烷的转化率大约翻倍，C2和C3产物的选择性比不添加TCM时增加了三倍。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同。对于甲烷，Sm、La和Pr的稀土氧化物能有效地生成C2+烃，而氧化铈只产生碳氧化物。然而，对于丙烷，添加TCM的氧化铈显示出转化率和选择性的显著改善，而其他稀土氧化物添加TCM后效果不明显。

该研究没有提供其他卤素辅助方法的信息，如卤素脱氢、氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐法进行丙烷脱氢。需要进一步的研究才能全面比较这些方法。
