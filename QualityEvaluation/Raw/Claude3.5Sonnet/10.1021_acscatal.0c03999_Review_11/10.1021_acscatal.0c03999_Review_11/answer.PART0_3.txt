[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."

[2] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

[3] "The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX."

[4] "Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15)."

Several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene are described:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses direct halogenation to activate propane. A specific example is propane halo-dehydrogenation using Cl2 over a Ru/TiO2 catalyst, achieving 50% propane conversion and 95% propene selectivity at 400°C.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogenation with oxygen to improve efficiency.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to produce alkyl halides, alkenes, and water. It can theoretically achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2.

4. Molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) (LiX + O2): This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 at temperatures between 450-600°C, achieving propene yields up to 70%.

These methods generally operate under relatively mild temperatures between 300-700°C. The reaction conditions vary for each method, with temperatures ranging from 400°C for halo-dehydrogenation to 600°C for molten salt catalysis.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of methane and ethane due to the differences in the chemical structure and bonding of these alkanes. Propane, being a larger molecule with more carbon-hydrogen bonds, offers more opportunities for selective dehydrogenation. Additionally, the presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane makes it more reactive than methane or ethane, which only have primary carbon atoms. This difference in reactivity allows for more selective activation of propane under milder conditions compared to its smaller counterparts.

几种卤素辅助的丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的方法包括：

1. 分子卤素脱氢（X2）：这种方法使用直接卤化来活化丙烷。一个具体的例子是使用Cl2在Ru/TiO2催化剂上进行丙烷卤代脱氢，在400°C下实现50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择性。

2. 卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法结合卤化和氧气来提高效率。

3. 卤化物介导的丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：这种方法使用卤化氢和氧气来产生烷基卤化物、烯烃和水。理论上，在O2存在的情况下可以达到100%的卤素原子效率。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）（LiX + O2）：这种方法使用金属碘化物如LiI、CdI2、ZnI2和PbI2，在450-600°C的温度下进行，可以达到高达70%的丙烯收率。

这些方法通常在300-700°C的相对温和温度下操作。每种方法的反应条件不同，温度从卤代脱氢的400°C到熔盐催化的600°C不等。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷有显著不同，这是由于这些烷烃的化学结构和键合差异造成的。丙烷作为一个更大的分子，有更多的碳氢键，为选择性脱氢提供了更多机会。此外，丙烷中存在二级碳原子，使其比只有一级碳原子的甲烷或乙烷更具反应性。这种反应性的差异使得丙烷可以在比其较小的同系物更温和的条件下进行选择性活化。
