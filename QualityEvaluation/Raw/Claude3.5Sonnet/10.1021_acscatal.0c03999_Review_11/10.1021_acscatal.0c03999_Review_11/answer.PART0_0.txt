[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."

[2] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

[3] "Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C."

[4] "The oxychlorination reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15)."

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses Cl2 with a Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 400°C, achieving 50% propane conversion and 95% propene selectivity.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation with halogens (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogens with oxygen to improve efficiency.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen, offering potentially 100% halogen atom efficiency compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation.

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation: Developed by Shell, this approach uses metal iodides (LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, PbI2) at 450-600°C, achieving up to 70% propene yield.

Reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally occur between 300-700°C. The molten salt method specifically operates at 450-600°C.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its unique molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which only have primary carbons. This structural difference affects the ease of C-H bond activation and the subsequent reaction pathways, leading to different product distributions and requiring tailored catalytic approaches for each alkane.

选择性地将丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的卤素辅助方法包括：

1. 分子卤素脱氢（X2）：该方法在400°C下使用Cl2和Ru/TiO2催化剂，实现50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择性。

2. 卤素氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法将卤素与氧气结合，以提高效率。

3. 丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：该方法使用卤化氢和氧气，与卤代脱氢相比，可能实现100%的卤素原子效率，而后者仅为50%。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助氧化脱氢：由壳牌公司开发，这种方法在450-600°C下使用金属碘化物（LiI、CdI2、ZnI2、PbI2），可达到70%的丙烯产率。

每种方法的反应条件不同，但通常在300-700°C之间进行。熔融盐方法特别在450-600°C下操作。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其独特的分子结构。丙烷同时具有伯碳和仲碳原子，使其比只有伯碳的甲烷和乙烷更具反应性。这种结构差异影响了C-H键活化的难易程度和随后的反应路径，导致不同的产物分布，并需要为每种烷烃量身定制催化方法。
