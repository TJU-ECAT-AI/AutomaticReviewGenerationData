[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."

[2] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

[3] "Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C."

[4] "The oxychlorination reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15)."

Halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses Cl2 with a Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 400°C, achieving 50% propane conversion and 95% propene selectivity.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation with halogens (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogens with oxygen to improve efficiency.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen, offering potentially 100% halogen atom efficiency compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation.

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation: Developed by Shell, this approach uses metal iodides (LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, PbI2) at 450-600°C, achieving up to 70% propene yield.

Reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally occur between 300-700°C. The molten salt method specifically operates at 450-600°C.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to its unique molecular structure. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane and ethane, which only have primary carbons. This structural difference affects the ease of C-H bond activation and the subsequent reaction pathways, leading to different product distributions and requiring tailored catalytic approaches for each alkane.

选择性地将丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的卤素辅助方法包括：

1. 分子卤素脱氢（X2）：该方法在400°C下使用Cl2和Ru/TiO2催化剂，实现50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择性。

2. 卤素氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法将卤素与氧气结合，以提高效率。

3. 丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：该方法使用卤化氢和氧气，与卤代脱氢相比，可能实现100%的卤素原子效率，而后者仅为50%。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助氧化脱氢：由壳牌公司开发，这种方法在450-600°C下使用金属碘化物（LiI、CdI2、ZnI2、PbI2），可达到70%的丙烯产率。

每种方法的反应条件不同，但通常在300-700°C之间进行。熔融盐方法特别在450-600°C下操作。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于其独特的分子结构。丙烷同时具有伯碳和仲碳原子，使其比只有伯碳的甲烷和乙烷更具反应性。这种结构差异影响了C-H键活化的难易程度和随后的反应路径，导致不同的产物分布，并需要为每种烷烃量身定制催化方法。

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses halogens directly to dehydrogenate propane. For example, propane halo-dehydrogenation using Cl2 over a Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% propane conversion and 95% propene selectivity at 400°C.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene.

4. Molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) (LiX + O2): Developed by Shell, this approach uses metal iodides (e.g., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2) in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450 and 600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70%.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally occur at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700°C. The molten salt method specifically operates between 450 and 600°C.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of methane and ethane due to its different molecular structure. Notably, propene (the product) has reactive allylic hydrogen atoms, which can lead to successive oxidation. This makes it more challenging to achieve high propene selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane. The presence of these reactive hydrogen atoms in propene contributes to lower selectivity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

2. 卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法将卤素与氧气结合，以促进脱氢过程。

3. 通过卤化物进行的丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：这种方法使用卤化氢和氧气将丙烷转化为丙烯。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）（LiX + O2）：由壳牌公司开发，这种方法使用熔融盐形式的金属碘化物（如LiI、CdI2、ZnI2和PbI2）。反应在450至600°C之间进行，丙烯产率可达70%。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常在300至700°C的相对温和温度下进行。熔融盐法特别在450至600°C之间操作。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷有显著不同，这是由于其分子结构不同。值得注意的是，丙烯（产物）具有活性烯丙基氢原子，这可能导致连续氧化。与乙烷制乙烯相比，这使得获得高丙烯选择性更具挑战性。丙烯中这些活性氢原子的存在导致丙烷氧化脱氢的选择性比乙烷脱氢低。

- Reactants differ based on the specific method (e.g., Cl2, HX + O2, or metal iodides + O2)

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to differences in the alkanes' structures and bond strengths. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane or ethane, which only have primary carbons. This structural difference affects the ease of C-H bond activation and the stability of intermediates formed during the dehydrogenation process, leading to different reaction pathways and product distributions compared to shorter chain alkanes.

4. Molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) (LiX + O2): This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 at temperatures between 450-600°C, achieving propene yields up to 70%.

These methods generally operate under relatively mild temperatures between 300-700°C. The reaction conditions vary for each method, with temperatures ranging from 400°C for halo-dehydrogenation to 600°C for molten salt catalysis.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of methane and ethane due to the differences in the chemical structure and bonding of these alkanes. Propane, being a larger molecule with more carbon-hydrogen bonds, offers more opportunities for selective dehydrogenation. Additionally, the presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane makes it more reactive than methane or ethane, which only have primary carbon atoms. This difference in reactivity allows for more selective activation of propane under milder conditions compared to its smaller counterparts.

2. 卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法结合卤化和氧气来提高效率。

3. 卤化物介导的丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：这种方法使用卤化氢和氧气来产生烷基卤化物、烯烃和水。理论上，在O2存在的情况下可以达到100%的卤素原子效率。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）（LiX + O2）：这种方法使用金属碘化物如LiI、CdI2、ZnI2和PbI2，在450-600°C的温度下进行，可以达到高达70%的丙烯收率。

这些方法通常在300-700°C的相对温和温度下操作。每种方法的反应条件不同，温度从卤代脱氢的400°C到熔盐催化的600°C不等。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷有显著不同，这是由于这些烷烃的化学结构和键合差异造成的。丙烷作为一个更大的分子，有更多的碳氢键，为选择性脱氢提供了更多机会。此外，丙烷中存在二级碳原子，使其比只有一级碳原子的甲烷或乙烷更具反应性。这种反应性的差异使得丙烷可以在比其较小的同系物更温和的条件下进行选择性活化。
