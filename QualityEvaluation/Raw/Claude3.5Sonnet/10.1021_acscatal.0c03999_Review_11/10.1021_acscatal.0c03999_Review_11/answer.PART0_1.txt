[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."

[2] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

[3] "Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C."

[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved"

[5] "C3H6 selectivity during the C3H8 oxidative dehydrogenation is generally lower than that of C2H4 from C2H6 because of the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in the case of C3H6, which can lead to successive oxidation of C3H6."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses halogens directly to dehydrogenate propane. For example, propane halo-dehydrogenation using Cl2 over a Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% propane conversion and 95% propene selectivity at 400°C.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene.

4. Molten metal halide salts assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) (LiX + O2): Developed by Shell, this approach uses metal iodides (e.g., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2) in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450 and 600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70%.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally occur at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700°C. The molten salt method specifically operates between 450 and 600°C.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of methane and ethane due to its different molecular structure. Notably, propene (the product) has reactive allylic hydrogen atoms, which can lead to successive oxidation. This makes it more challenging to achieve high propene selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane. The presence of these reactive hydrogen atoms in propene contributes to lower selectivity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 分子卤素脱氢（X2）：这种方法直接使用卤素对丙烷进行脱氢。例如，在Ru/TiO2催化剂上使用Cl2进行丙烷卤素脱氢，在400°C下可达到50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择性。

2. 卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法将卤素与氧气结合，以促进脱氢过程。

3. 通过卤化物进行的丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：这种方法使用卤化氢和氧气将丙烷转化为丙烯。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）（LiX + O2）：由壳牌公司开发，这种方法使用熔融盐形式的金属碘化物（如LiI、CdI2、ZnI2和PbI2）。反应在450至600°C之间进行，丙烯产率可达70%。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常在300至700°C的相对温和温度下进行。熔融盐法特别在450至600°C之间操作。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷有显著不同，这是由于其分子结构不同。值得注意的是，丙烯（产物）具有活性烯丙基氢原子，这可能导致连续氧化。与乙烷制乙烯相比，这使得获得高丙烯选择性更具挑战性。丙烯中这些活性氢原子的存在导致丙烷氧化脱氢的选择性比乙烷脱氢低。
