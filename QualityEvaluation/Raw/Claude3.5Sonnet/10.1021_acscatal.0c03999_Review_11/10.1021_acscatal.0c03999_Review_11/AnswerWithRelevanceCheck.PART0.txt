          "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."

"Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C."

"The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX."

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15)."

"It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

"C3H6 selectivity during the C3H8 oxidative dehydrogenation is generally lower than that of C2H4 from C2H6 because of the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in the case of C3H6, which can lead to successive oxidation of C3H6."

          The various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene include:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses halogens directly to remove hydrogen from propane. For example, using Cl2 with a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst at 400°C achieves 50% propane conversion with 95% propene selectivity.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogens (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogens with oxygen to facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen to convert propane to propene. The reaction proceeds through the oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water. Theoretically, it can achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation.

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2): This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 in a molten salt form. The reaction occurs between 450-600°C and can achieve propene yields up to 70%.

The reaction conditions vary for each method, but generally occur at relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700°C. Specific temperature ranges and catalysts are used for different methods, such as 400°C for halo-dehydrogenation with Ru/TiO2 catalyst and 450-600°C for molten salt approaches.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to differences in the alkanes' structures and bond strengths. Propane has both primary and secondary carbon atoms, making it more reactive than methane or ethane, which only have primary carbons. Additionally, the presence of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms in propene (the product) can lead to successive oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity compared to ethylene production from ethane. These structural differences affect the ease of C-H bond activation, the stability of intermediates formed during the dehydrogenation process, and the overall reaction pathways, leading to different product distributions compared to shorter chain alkanes.

          选择性地将丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的各种卤素辅助方法包括：

1. 分子卤素脱氢（X2）：这种方法直接使用卤素从丙烷中移除氢。例如，在400°C下使用0.28% Ru/TiO2催化剂和Cl2可以实现50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择性。

2. 卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法将卤素与氧气结合，以促进脱氢过程。

3. 通过卤化物的丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：这种方法使用氢卤化物和氧气将丙烷转化为丙烯。反应通过氢卤化物与O2的氧化进行，生成烷基卤化物、烯烃和水。理论上，在O2存在的情况下可以达到100%的卤素原子效率，而卤素脱氢的效率仅为50%。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助氧化脱氢（LiX + O2）：这种方法使用LiI、CdI2、ZnI2和PbI2等金属碘化物的熔融盐形式。反应在450-600°C之间进行，可以达到高达70%的丙烯产率。

每种方法的反应条件各不相同，但通常在300至700°C的相对温和温度下进行。不同方法使用特定的温度范围和催化剂，例如卤素脱氢使用Ru/TiO2催化剂在400°C下进行，而熔融盐方法在450-600°C之间进行。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于烷烃结构和键强度的差异。丙烷同时具有伯碳和仲碳原子，使其比只有伯碳的甲烷或乙烷更具反应性。此外，丙烯（产物）中存在活性烯丙基氢原子，可能导致连续氧化，从而使选择性低于乙烷制乙烯。这些结构差异影响了C-H键活化的难易程度、脱氢过程中形成的中间体的稳定性以及整体反应途径，导致与短链烷烃相比产物分布不同。
