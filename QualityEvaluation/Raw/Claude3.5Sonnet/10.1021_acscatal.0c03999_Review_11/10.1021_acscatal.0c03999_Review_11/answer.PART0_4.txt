[1] "A selective activation of C3H8 can be achieved via halogen-mediated pathways under relatively mild temperatures between 300 and 700 C. To obtain C3H6 from C3H8, different approaches can be used (Figure 22), such as the dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2), oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2), propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2), and molten metal halide salts assisted ODHP (LiX + O2)."

[2] "It is important to note that the catalytic transformation of C3H8 in these routes is quite different from other alkanes such as methane and ethane because of the differences in reactivity of the respective alkanes."

[3] "The propane oxyhalogenation reaction proceeds via oxidation of hydrogen halide with O2, producing alkyl halide, alkene, and water (eqs 2-242-29). Theoretically, 100% halogen atom efficiency can be achieved in the presence of O2, whereas efficiency is limited to 50% for halo-dehydrogenation (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22) due to the formation of HX."

[4] "Propane halo-dehydrogenation by Cl2 has been studied over a 0.28% Ru/TiO2 catalyst that achieves 50% C3H8 conversion and 95% C3H6 selectivity at 400 C."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons on metal iodide-based molten salt was first developed by Shell. In those approaches, the ODHP reaction can occur between 450 and 600 C in the presence of metal iodides (i.e., LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2), and a C3H6 yield up to 70% can be achieved (Table 15)."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Dehydrogenation with molecular halogens (X2): This method uses halogen molecules directly. For example, propane halo-dehydrogenation with Cl2 over a Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieves 50% propane conversion and 95% propene selectivity at 400°C.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of halogen (X2 + O2): This approach combines halogens with oxygen.

3. Propane oxyhalogenation via halides (HX + O2): This method uses hydrogen halides and oxygen. It can theoretically achieve 100% halogen atom efficiency in the presence of O2, compared to 50% efficiency for halo-dehydrogenation due to HX formation.

4. Molten metal halide salt-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (LiX + O2): This approach uses metal iodides like LiI, CdI2, ZnI2, and PbI2 at temperatures between 450-600°C, achieving propene yields up to 70%.

These methods generally operate under relatively mild temperatures between 300-700°C. The reactivity of propane in these processes differs significantly from methane and ethane due to the differences in reactivity of these alkanes. This is likely due to propane's structure allowing for more diverse reaction pathways and intermediate products compared to the simpler methane and ethane molecules.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的方法来选择性地将丙烷脱氢成丙烯：

1. 分子卤素脱氢（X2）：这种方法直接使用卤素分子。例如，在Ru/TiO2催化剂上用Cl2进行丙烷卤素脱氢，在400°C下可以达到50%的丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择性。

2. 卤素存在下的氧化脱氢（X2 + O2）：这种方法将卤素与氧气结合使用。

3. 通过卤化物进行丙烷氧卤化（HX + O2）：这种方法使用氢卤化物和氧气。理论上，在O2存在的情况下可以达到100%的卤素原子效率，相比之下，由于HX的形成，卤素脱氢的效率仅为50%。

4. 熔融金属卤化物盐辅助的氧化脱氢（LiX + O2）：这种方法使用金属碘化物，如LiI、CdI2、ZnI2和PbI2，在450-600°C的温度下进行，可以达到高达70%的丙烯产率。

这些方法通常在300-700°C的相对温和温度下操作。丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷显著不同，这是由于这些烷烃的反应活性差异。这可能是因为丙烷的结构允许更多样化的反应途径和中间产物，而相比之下，甲烷和乙烷分子结构更简单。
