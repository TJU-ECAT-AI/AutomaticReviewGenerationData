Sites for Methane Activation on Lithium-Doped Magnesium Oxide Surfaces
Graphical Abstract
The energy barriers for methane activation by hydrogen abstraction at oxygen radical sites are unrealistically low. CH bonds can also heterolytically add onto a regular MgO ion pair at morphological defects such as steps and corners. Release of methyl radicals into the gas phase will happen only in the presence of O2.
Abstract
Density functional calculations yield energy barriers for H abstraction by oxygen radical sites in Li-doped MgO that are much smaller (126kJmol1) than the barriers inferred from different experimental studies (80160kJmol1). This raises further doubts that the Li+O. site is the active site as postulated by Lunsford. From temperature-programmed oxidative coupling reactions of methane (OCM), we conclude that the same sites are responsible for the activation of CH4 on both Li-doped MgO and pure MgO catalysts. For a MgO catalyst prepared by solgel synthesis, the activity proved to be very different in the initial phase of the OCM reaction and in the steady state. This was accompanied by substantial morphological changes and restructuring of the terminations as transmission electron microscopy revealed. Further calculations on cluster models showed that CH4 binds heterolytically on Mg2+O2 sites at steps and corners, and that the homolytic release of methyl radicals into the gas phase will happen only in the presence of O2.
Taylors active site concept1 has stimulated catalysis research over almost a century, but it took many decades until surface science identified low-coordinated atoms at step edges as active sites of metal catalysts.2 Subsequently, the complex nature of active sites at supported metal3 or metal oxide catalysts4,5 has been revealed by combined experimental and computational studies. With the raw material shift in chemical industry to natural gas, there is renewed interest in the formation of higher hydrocarbons, for example by oxidative coupling of methane (OCM):6

The simplest catalysts for this reaction, among a large number of complex solid oxides, is Li-doped MgO.7 Early, Lunsford proposed that the active sites are O. radicals neighbored to Li+, with Li+O. formally replacing Mg2+O2,8 and that the CH bond is activated by homolytic splitting involving hydrogen atom transfer to the O. sites:9
(2)
However, there is also evidence that the Li+O. site may not be the active site and that the CH bond may be heterolytically split,6 as Lunsford already mentioned in his 1995 review.7 Recently, crucial ENDOR experiments showed that in none of the powder catalysts that were run under an OCM atmosphere Li+O centers could be found,10,11 although they were detectable in Li-doped MgO single crystals prepared by arc fusion of MgO/Li2CO3.10 Instead, by careful multi-method characterization,11,12 Li addition was found to lead to restructuring of the MgO surface exposing steps and corner sites and high-index crystallographic surfaces alien to pristine MgO. Studies of thin MgO films by surface science techniques reached the same conclusion.10
Herein, we provide theoretical and further experimental evidence that the Li+O. site is not the active site and conclude that the activity of OCM catalysts is connected with morphological features of the crystallites that form under reaction conditions and depend on the synthesis process. Lunsford already points to a discrepancy7 between the measured apparent activation energy for the formation of methyl radicals (968kJmol1)13 and quantum chemical calculations. In 2005 Catlow etal. used density functional theory and periodic models to calculate the energy barrier of H abstraction by an O. site at the (001) surface of Li-doped MgO.14 The barrier obtained, 74kJmol1, is more or less in apparent agreement with the above value and reported barriers of 85kJmol1 (CH4/CD4 isotope exchange)15 and 90kJmol1 (C2 hydrocarbon formation).16 Microkinetic simulations yielded significantly higher values, namely 147kJmol1.17 More recently, Li-doped MgO catalysts have been found unstable under reaction conditions, and after 24h time on stream barriers between 89 and 160kJmol1 have been measured, depending on the synthesis method.18
We report quantum chemical calculations that go beyond limitations of previous work as far as models for the active site, localization method of the transition structure and accuracy of the quantum chemical approach are concerned. Our predicted energy barriers, between 76 and 276kJmol1, are surprisingly low compared to the experimental results, which suggests that the Li+O. site is not the active site.
Support for this conclusion comes from temperature programmed reaction experiments, which show that on both Li-doped MgO and pure MgO catalysts conversion of CH4 and O2 starts at about 410C and formation of C2 species at about 540C. The difference is that in this initial phase of the reaction Li-MgO is far more active and selective in forming C2 coupling products than pure MgO. We conclude that the reaction pathways are the same for both materials and that the same active sites are present. The role of Li-doping is increasing the number of active sites, which is most likely due to changes of the morphology connected with the formation of a larger number of low-coordinate O2 ions at edges, corners, and kinks.1012
For further kinetic studies, a pure MgO model catalyst has been synthesized by a solgel process and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The catalyst activity was very different in the initial phase of the OCM reaction and in the steady state, and this was accompanied by substantial morphological changes. In the steady state, the apparent activation barrier for CH4 conversion is 1332kJmol1, within the 80 to 160kJmol1 range inferred before for Li-doped MgO.1518
To further explore possible sites for CH4 activation on Li-free MgO catalysts, we have examined the interaction of CH4 with morphological defects (steps, corners) by DFT. The calculations showed that the CH bond adds heterolytically onto an Mg2+O2 ion pair, but that homolytic release of methyl radicals in the gas phase is only likely in the presence of O2.
Figure1 shows both cluster and periodic models adopted for the Li+O. site at the MgO (001) surface terrace. The LiO(MgO)8 cluster has the topology of a two-layer cut-out from the surface. In the constraint cluster model we limit structure relaxation to the Li+ and O. ions in the center of the cluster, whereas the positions of all other atoms are fixed at the positions they have in the MgO bulk. In our four-layer slab model, all of the ion positions are relaxed except those in the two bottom layers. The B3LYP hybrid density functional19,20 has been used, which reproduces within 6kJmol1 CCSD(T) coupled cluster results of CH bond splitting barriers for CH4 at O. sites of (MgO)n.+ clusters.21,22 CCSD(T) is considered to be chemically accurate. For gas-phase metal oxide clusters featuring radical sites, B3LYP has also been shown to correctly predict for which clusters hydrogen abstraction can be observed by mass spectrometry and for which not.21,23

Figure1 shows the geometric structures of the active site and the transition state (for bond distances, see the Supporting Information) as well as the spin densities. In the transition structure, the spin localizes at the surface oxygen ion above the lithium ion for all models. In the initial state, the unconstrained model shows delocalization over two additional oxygen ions. This is rectified when embedding the cluster in a periodic array of point charges and a finite number of full ion pseudopotentials, which also lowers the apparent barrier by 20kJmol1 (Table1, terrace). The periodic model barrier is only 14kJmol1 lower than the embedded cluster barrier and 12kJmol1 of this difference are due to relaxing a larger number of atoms in the periodic model. This we gather from the single point embedded cluster result at the structure obtained for the periodic model.

We conclude that for Li+O. terrace sites, the activation barrier is as low as 126kJmol1 (Table1). The much higher previous estimates (74kJmol1)14 we ascribe to neglect of dispersion and an incomplete optimization for the transition structure in that study. For different morphological positions, for example, at corners, depending on the model the barriers may be 5kJmol1 lower (corner 1) or 15kJmol1 higher (corner 2) than for terrace sites (Table1, last row, values in brackets).
Temperature-programmed reaction measurements were carried out on 150mg of pure MgO and 5wt% Li-doped MgO, both prepared by gel combustion synthesis as described previously.11 Briefly, glycerol as fuel was mixed with aqueous solutions of LiNO3 and Mg(NO3)2. After water was removed by evaporation, a highly energetic combustible gel was obtained in which Li+ and Mg2+ ions were molecularly dispersed. Upon ignition, the gel combusted vigorously to the oxides followed by rapid thermal quenching. However, despite rapid combustion and rapid thermal quenching, which may lead to structures far from equilibrium, it was not possible to detect Li+O defects in any material obtained this way. As discussed in detail in Ref.11, CW-EPR, ENDOR and DR-UV/Vis, all established diagnostic methods for Li+O defects,10,25 were applied, but no method could detect Li+O defects in any of our materials. Using optical spectroscopy morphological defects, that is, low-coordinate O2 ions at edges, corners, and kinks of the MgO surface have been identified that arise from the volatilization of the Li component being initially present in the MgO sample as solid solution.
The pure MgO and the Li-doped MgO catalysts were subjected to a temperature ramp of 3Kmin1 in a plug flow reactor using an OCM mixture consisting of 10mLmin1 CH4, 1.25mLmin1 O2, and 2mLmin1 Ar as internal standard. Figure2 shows the results for CH4, O2, C2H4, and C2H6; the corresponding data for CO and CO2 formation are given in the Supporting Information. On both catalysts, O2 and CH4 conversion into CO2 commences at about 410C with CO2 as the far dominant oxidation product. Arrhenius plots on O2 consumption (see the Supporting Information) give very similar apparent activation energies of 205 and 184kJmol1 on pure MgO and Li-MgO, respectively, indicating a similar mechanism of initial O2 activation on both materials. CO, C2H6, and C2H4 formation begins on both materials at 540C, but Li-MgO is far more active and selective in forming C2 coupling products than pure MgO.

TEM investigations of MgO particles obtained by a solgel process show substantial morphology changes during time on-stream. Figure3 shows a TEM image of the MgO catalyst used for the data in Table2 after 6h and after 230h time on-stream. Careful transfer into the TEM under exclusion of air reveals the restructuring of the termination, losing the (100) orientation from the fresh MgO for a rough termination structure. In both cases, substantial numbers of non-terrace sites are present that expose Mg sites with lower coordination than fivefold and may serve as active sites. The diffuse termination of the 230h used sample indicates the presence of additional terminating species, such as OH groups that may block many of such sites for methane adsorption.

Concomitantly with the morphological changes, the catalyst activity was very different in the initial phase of the OCM reaction and the steady state (Table2). CH4 conversion and C2 selectivity changed from 26 and 30%, respectively, to 5 and 14%, respectively. This is connected with substantial restructuring as the rate per catalyst weight reduces by factor of 25, whereas the rate per surface area reduces by a factor of 4.4 only.
As a model for morphological defects (steps, corners) on Li-free MgO catalysts we adopt the (MgO)9 cluster. Figure4 shows the energy diagram for the reaction with CH4. Chemisorption occurs by heterolytic addition of the CH bond onto an Mg2+O2 pair:

The surface species formed are an OH group (by protonation of O2) and a Grignard type Mg-methylate (by addition of CH3 to Mg2+). Such reactions have been discussed before,26 for example, for low-coordinate sites on γ-alumina.27 The barrier for this slightly endothermic reaction is at the low side of typical barriers for OCM reactions, but releasing a methyl radical to the gas phase is barrierless but needs as much as 228kJmol1. However, the unpaired electron formed in this reaction facilitates O2 chemisorption as a superoxide species:
(4)
This reaction is very exothermic (191kJmol1,28 so that the overall process:
(5)
becomes almost thermal neutral (ΔE=37kJmol1). There is, of course, an entropy penalty, as two gas-phase species are converted into one, but reaction (5) also yields a superoxo surface species that is more reactive than O2 in the gas phase.
Future studies should also consider possible reactions of dioxygen with the Mg-methylate, which may also lead to methyl radicals and surface peroxo species.29,30 Pros and cons of reaction(5) as a possible source of methyl radicals in the OCM process have already been discussed.7 Our model calculations are indeed strong evidence that heterolytic chemisorption of CH4 on MgO in the presence of O2 becomes energetically feasible on morphological defects such as steps or corners and plays a significant role in the OCM process. Currently, we are further investigating possible mechanisms based on this idea. Whereas quantum chemical calculations on realistic models as presented here can provide reliable information on individual reaction steps, comparison with experimental kinetic data requires micro-kinetic simulations that use these data as input.
Our experiments (see also Ref.31)in combination with theoretical studies suggest a different role of non-reducible oxides as catalysts on methane activation. Their role is not to provide and receive back electrons as with reducible oxide catalysts, but merely to stay inert with its own electronic system and just bring together the reactants allowing exchanging redox equivalents directly between themselves. Such a function is expressed in the designation catalyst meaning the bringing together of reactants.
