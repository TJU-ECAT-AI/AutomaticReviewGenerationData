Halogen-assisted methods for selective propane dehydrogenation have emerged as a promising approach in the field of catalytic conversion of light alkanes. This comparative analysis explores various techniques, including chlorine-mediated, bromine-mediated, and iodine-mediated processes, each offering distinct advantages and challenges. The study examines the influence of reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition on the selectivity and yield of propylene production. Propane's unique reactivity, stemming from its molecular structure and C-H bond strengths, is scrutinized to understand its behavior under different halogen-assisted environments. The analysis also delves into the mechanistic aspects of these reactions, highlighting the role of halogen species in activating C-H bonds and facilitating dehydrogenation. Additionally, the environmental and economic implications of these methods are considered, with a focus on process efficiency, catalyst stability, and potential for industrial scale-up. By comparing these diverse approaches, this investigation aims to identify the most promising pathways for enhancing propane dehydrogenation and contributing to the development of more sustainable petrochemical processes.
