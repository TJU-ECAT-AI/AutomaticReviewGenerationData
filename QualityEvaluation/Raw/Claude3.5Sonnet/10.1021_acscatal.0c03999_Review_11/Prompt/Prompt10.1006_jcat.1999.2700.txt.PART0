In the absence of tetrachloromethane (TCM) carbon dioxide is
the principal product formed in the oxidation of propane on ceria.
The introduction of small partial pressures of TCM increases the
conversion of propane with selectivities to propene up to 80%. Ex-
cept under special circumstances no evidence of chlorinated species
from TCM is found in the bulk structure while the surface region
is shown to contain chlorine, although its form is not known. The
enhancement of conversion and selectivity to propene is shown to
be dependent upon the presence of chlorine, in whatever form, in
the surface region of the catalyst.

INTRODUCTION
Heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of propane typically contain vanadium and magnesium
asthecriticalelements(14).Relativelylittleworkhasbeen
reported in which rare earth oxides are employed as cata-
lysts in this reaction (5, 6) in spite of evidence of their ac-
tivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of methane (710)
and ethane (11, 12). Both gas- and solid-phase additives
have been examined for alkane oxidation processes, in par-
ticular those involving methane (1319). Early studies on
the oxidation of methane have shown that the introduc-
tion of a halomethane improves the selectivity to formalde-
hyde on supported palladium and platinum catalysts
(13, 14) and higher selectivities to C2+ hydrocarbons have
been reported on Na/Mn/SiO2 catalysts in the presence of
gaseous CH3Cl or HCl (15). Work in one of our labora-
tories has found that the addition of tetrachloromethane
(TCM) increases the yield of formaldehyde on heteropoly-

oxometalates in the partial oxidation of methane (16) and
of C2 hydrocarbons in the oxidative coupling of methane
(OCM) on a variety of silica-supported oxides (17). With
alkali metal-doped oxides as catalysts for the OCM pro-
cess the introduction of the alkali metals by employing
the corresponding chlorides led to increases in the selec-
tivities to C2 hydrocarbons (18, 19). Relatively little work
has been reported on the use of gas-phase additives in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. More recently, the
OCM process on Pr6O11 (9, 10) and the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of ethane on CeO2 (11) and Pr6O11 (12) were
shown to benefit from the addition of small partial pres-
sures of tetrachloromethane to the feedstream. A prelimi-
nary study has shown that while the oxides of lanthanum,
cerium, praseodymium, and samarium are active in the ox-
idative dehydrogenation of propane only that of cerium
is substantially activated by the introduction of TCM
(20).
The present work reports on the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of propane on cerium oxide and the effect of the intro-
duction of TCM to the feedstream.
EXPERIMENTAL
The catalytic experiments were performed in a fixed-bed
continuous-flow quartz reactor operated at atmospheric
pressure. Details of the reactor design have been described
elsewhere (20). In all experiments, the catalyst was heated
to the reaction temperature while maintaining a continu-
ous flow of helium and was held at this temperature under
a 25 ml/min flow of oxygen for 1 h. No homogeneous
oxidation of propane was observed at 723 K under the
present conditions (20). Column systems and definitions
of the conversion and selectivity have been reported previ-
ously (20). Blank experiments conducted with propane ab-
sent from the feed (O2 + TCM + He) indicated that TCM is

converted to HCl while producing carbon oxides. Although
the quantities of carbon oxides produced in the latter exper-
iments were small, all of the data reported were corrected
by performing duplicate experiments with propane absent
under otherwise identical values of the process variables.
The carbon mass balances were 100  5%. Powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Rigaku
RINT 2500 X, using monochromatized CuKα radiation.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Shimadzu ESCA-
1000AX) used MgKα radiation. The binding energies were
corrected using 285 eV for C 1s as an internal standard.

Effect of the partial pressure of O2 on propane oxidation in the absence (A) and presence (B) of TCM on CeO2 at 723 K. Reaction
conditions: W = 0.5 g, F = 30 ml/min, P(C3H8) = 14.4 kPa, P(O2) as shown, P(TCM) = 0 or 0.17 kPa diluted with He. Catalysts were pretreated with O2
(25 ml/min) for 1 h at the reaction temperature.
RESULTS
In the absence of TCM, CO2 was the principal product
from the oxidation of propane and the selectivity to this
oxide remained relatively unchanged with increases in the
partial pressure of O2, while the conversion of propane,
as expected, increased (Fig. 1A). Oxygen limiting condi-
tions prevailed for all partial pressures of oxygen emp-
loyed.
On addition of TCM at 0.17 kPa (Fig. 1B) the conver-
sion of propane increased at all partial pressures of O2,

although more substantially at the lower values of the lat-
ter. Concomitantly the selectivity to C3H6 was significantly
increased. It should be noted that the conversion of O2 de-
creased with increasing partial pressures of O2.
To provide further information on the catalytic prop-
erties of CeO2 experiments in the absence of O2 were
performed. With neither oxidant nor TCM present, no
conversion of propane was observed. On introduction of
TCM, 0.8% propane was converted and selectivities to
C3H6, C2H4, and CO2 of 71.0, 10.0, and 19.0%, respectively,
were measured.
XRD patterns of CeO2 after use in the oxidation of
propane without and with TCM were essentially identical
to that for fresh CeO2 (JCPDS 34-0394) regardless of the
partial pressure of O2 employed (not shown).
The XP spectra of CeO2 previously used in the oxida-
tion with TCM contained peaks at 883 eV due to Ce 3d5/2,
at 530 and 532 eV, ascribed to O1s, the former of which
can be related to lattice oxygen (21), and at 199 eV due to
Cl 2p. The values of Cl/Ce on the surface of CeO2 used at
pressures of O2 equal to 0, 2.1, 4.2, 8.4, and 12.6 kPa were
0.23, 0.31, 0.53, 0.31, and 0.25, respectively.
Although changes in the residence time (W/F) have lit-
tle or no effect on the conversion and selectivities in the
absence of TCM, with TCM present in the feedstream the
conversion of C3H8 increases with W/F reaching a plateau
at approximately 17% (not shown). Concomitantly the
propane reaction rate decreased. The selectivity to C3H6
remains at approximately 70% for all W/F and small selec-
tivities to acetic acid and ethylene are observed. Extension
of the time-on-stream from 0.75 to 6 h produced little or
no change in the conversions and selectivities at any resi-
dence time. XRD patterns of the catalysts after use for 6
h were identified as CeO2 and no other species were de-
tected. As before, in spite of the absence of detectable Cl
in the bulk, the surface region indicated its presence in the
aforementioned samples. Although no trend in the Cl/Ce
values from XP spectra was discernable a maximum value
of 1.1 was reached.
The addition of a partial pressure of TCM equal to
0.085 kPa produces a conversion approximately twice that
observed in its absence and an increase in the C2 + C3 se-
lectivity by more than a factor of three with concomitant
decreases in the selectivities to carbon oxides (not shown).
A value for Cl/Ce of nearly 2 was obtained under these con-
ditions. A further increase of P(TCM) by a factor of two
produces only relatively small increases in the conversion
and C2 + C3 selectivities to approximately 17 and 75%, re-
spectively. Additional increases in P(TCM) have little or
no effect on either the conversions or the selectivities. In-
creases in the time-on-stream generally produced negligi-
ble observable changes in the reaction, although values of
Cl/Ce in excess of 1 were measured.
To provide ancillary information on the role of TCM in
the oxidation of propane the catalyst was exposed to a mix-

with a mixture of P(C3H8) = 14.4 kPa, P(O2) = 4.2 kPa, and P(TCM) = 0,
0.17, or 0.51 kPa diluted with He (total flow rate, 30 ml/min), followed

ture of C3H8, O2 and various partial pressures of TCM di-
luted with helium at 723 K for 6 h prior to the introduction
of the reactant stream not containing TCM (Fig. 2). After
pretreatmentofthecatalystatthelowestP(TCM)theselec-
tivities to C3H6 and CO were enhanced, while that to CO2
decreased and the conversion of C3H8 and the selectivity
to C2H4 increased slightly. However, for further increases
in the partial pressure of TCM to which the catalyst was
exposed during the pretreatment the changes in the afore-
mentioned reaction variables were relatively small.
XPS analyses showed that the values of Cl/Ce on the pre-
treated catalysts where P(TCM) was 0.17 and 0.51 kPa were
0.89 and 0.66, respectively, again significantly smaller than
expected for the formation of a stoichiometric chlorinated
analog of CeO2. XRD patterns of the catalyst pretreated at
0.51 kPa of TCM show the presence of a phase additional
to CeO2 at 2θ = 25.4, 34.2, and 30.9. Although the XRD
pattern for CeOCl is not available, these additional lines
appear at 2θ values similar to those in the XRD patterns of
the oxychlorides of various rare earth metals, for example,
Sm, La, and Pr, and consequently may be indicative of the
presence of the oxychloride of cerium.
DISCUSSION
The rare earth oxides of Sm, La, and Pr catalyze the con-
version of methane to form C2+ hydrocarbons with signifi-
cant selectivities (9, 10, 21). In contrast only the carbon ox-
ides are produced from methane with cerium oxide. With
236

the former three oxides, the introduction of TCM into the
feedstream has a positive effect on both the conversions
of methane and the selectivities to C2+ hydrocarbons while
with cerium oxide no increase of conversions is observed
and only carbon oxides are produced.
In contrast, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,
with which the earlier results for the oxides of Sm, La, and
Pr showed that the introduction of TCM had little or no
effect (20), the present work demonstrates that with CeO2
substantial increases of both the conversion of propane and
selectivity to C3H6 are observed on addition of TCM to the
feedstream. While care must be taken in comparing selec-
tivities at different conversions it is clear that both the con-
version of C3H8 and the selectivity to C3H6 are increased
on introduction of TCM. It must therefore be concluded
that the beneficial effect of TCM in this instance is not a
consequence of a reciprocal relationship between conver-
sion and selectivity but results from concomitant increases
in both conversion and selectivity to the desired product.
To be noted is the relatively large depression in the selectiv-
ity to CO2 on addition of TCM, while that to CO increases,
although remaining relatively small. Therefore, contrary to
observations with other catalytic systems with which the
effect of the introduction of TCM was, at least in part, the
suppression of the further oxidation of CO, with the present
catalyst and reaction the further oxidation of propane to
CO2 appears to be suppressed (22, 23).
Other differences between the present and earlier sys-
tems are evident. After either partial oxidation or oxida-
tive coupling of methane in the presence of TCM on a wide
variety of catalysts, almost inevitably XRD showed that a
chlorinated analog of the catalyst had been produced in
the bulk structure, in contrast to the present results under
which such species were not formed (23). However, as with
previous studies chlorine, in whatever form, was found in
the surface region after reaction in the presence of TCM.
The results of the experiments performed with neither O2
nor TCM present suggest that lattice oxygen does not par-
ticipate directly in the oxidation process. However, on in-
troduction of TCM, propane was converted to the expected
products with a relatively high selectivity to propene. Other
workershaveshownthatadsorbedoxygenisresponsiblefor
the activation of propane (6). The observations obtained
from the pretreated catalyst show that the enhancement of
conversion and selectivity result from the modification of
the catalyst by TCM, rather than a gas phase effect and
further, together with the XPS and XRD data, show that a
saturation with TCM is occurring in the surface, apparently
forming the stoichiometric equivalent of CeOCl whose in-
stability may preclude its formation throughout the bulk
of the catalyst. It is important to emphasize, however, that
little or no direct evidence is available for the formation of
CeOCl from CeO2 exposed to TCM. In this context it is
worth noting that the heats of formation of the analogous
oxychlorides from the oxides of La, Pr, Sm, and Ce and,
hence, at least approximately, the free energies of forma-
tion, are negative but that for CeOCl is only 8.0 kcal/mol,
a factor of 45 times smaller in magnitude than those for
the remaining three rare earth oxychlorides. While this data
is strictly applicable to 25C, nevertheless the formation of
the oxychloride of cerium is evidently the least thermody-
namically favored.
The ability of some of the lanthanides to assume a valency
of 4, in addition to their group valency of 3, is well known,
particularly for cerium, which has a higher proclivity for the
latter oxidation state than any of the remaining lanthanides.
It is also well known that this serves as the basis for the
use of ceria as an oxygen-storage compound in automobile
exhaust catalysts:
Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2 
2CeO2.
From the present results it is clear that the introduction of
TCM into the feedstream is chlorinating the surface. While
the values of Cl/Ce of one or less than one can be rational-
ized on the basis of the partial formation of the oxychloride
the stoichiometric equivalent may not, of course, be gener-
ated.
Of some relevance are reports of studies involving the
preparation of Rh/CeO2 catalysts, of importance in three-
way catalysis, by conventional impregnation or by ionic
exchange of metal complexes. A number of workers have
shown that the use of a chlorinated precursor could lead
to the formation of a CeOCl phase after reduction by H2
(2429).
A number of possibilities exist to account for the incor-
poration of TCM as chlorine into cerium oxide. Partial re-
duction of CeO2 during the ODH of propane could pro-
duce anionic (oxygen) vacancies which become occupied
by chlorine (26):
Ce4+O2Ce4+ Ce3+ u Ce3+ Ce3+ClCe3+.
Since the bulk of CeO2 would be unlikely to be reduced
during the ODH process, this may explain the absence of
CeOCl from XRD patterns. On the other hand, the pres-
ence and consumption of gas phase oxygen would suggest
that cerium is more likely to exist in its higher oxidation
state. Alternatively, where cerium is found in the +4 oxida-
tion state, the direct substitution of O2ions by chlorine,
Ce4+O2O2Ce4+O2Clu,
would lead to the formation of anionic vacancies which
could, with gas phase oxygen, form O
2 , a frequently pro-
posedoxidantinhydrocarbonoxidationprocesses(27).The
latter rationalization would be consistent with the obser-
vation that, in the absence of both TCM and oxygen no
conversion of propane occurs, whereas with TCM in the

feedstream but no oxidant the expected ODH products are
observed. In view of the significant partial pressures of oxy-
gen to which the catalyst is exposed during the ODH pro-
cess it would not be surprising to find a significant portion
of cerium in its higher oxidation state.
It is probable that both the aforementioned mechanisms
are operative during the ODH process with propane. This
would provide explanations for most of the observations
from the present work, particularly those related to the ap-
parent irregularity of chlorine concentrations in the surface
region which may result from the presence of both oxida-
tion states of cerium in the surface.
