ABSTRACT
This article investigates phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, 
and Cu) as catalysts for the selective transformation of propane via oxychlorination chemistry to 
propylene, a pivotal chemical commodity. The oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreases 
in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the 
selectivity to propylene ranks as CrPO (95-98%)  FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%)  
NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 
5-20% propane conversion. In-depth characterization using X-ray diffraction, Raman 
spectroscopy, and microscopy enables to assess the structural and morphological stability of the 
phosphate samples. The most selective catalyst, CrPO, whose performance, crystal structure, and 
morphology are demonstrated stable for over 60 h on stream, enables to reach propylene yields 
up to 50%, rivalling the best systems among any existing propane-to-propylene technology. 
Furthermore, the phosphate systems can be classified into four categories, depending on which 
products they favor, as propylene (CrPO, FePO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, 
CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or carbon oxides (VPO). Finally, a kinetic analysis of 
the oxychlorination, chlorination, and oxidation of propane as well as of propyl chloride 
dehydrochlorination and HCl oxidation over representative systems of each category rationalizes 
activity and selectivity patterns. In particular, the former is correlated to the materials ability to 
evolve chlorine, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast 
dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to evolve molecular chlorine 
to the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion.

1. INTRODUCTION
Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock 
to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers, 
chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.1-5 Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and 
fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane.6,7 Nevertheless, these technologies are highly 
energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in 
the chemical industry.8 Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap 
between propylene production and demand.9-13 It was predicted that the replacement of these 
technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result 
in substantial economic benefits.14 Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic 
dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination, 
which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been 
demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene.15,16 
Intensive research efforts led to the discovery of efficient catalysts including iron phosphate 
(FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), reaching 
propylene yields of  15%, 40%, and 55% at high (80-98%) selectivity, respectively.15,16 
In-depth kinetic analyses over these systems, as well as density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations over NiO-CeO2, provided strong insights on the mechanism of this reaction, which 
is believed to proceed via propyl chloride generation, followed by its dehydrochlorination into 
C3H6 over the catalyst surface.15-17 An analogous chlorine-induced surface confined mechanism 
has been recently demonstrated in ethane oxychlorination, EOC, over FePO4, which was shown 
to be pivotal for guaranteeing a high olefin selectivity.18 Despite these promising results, few 
systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, POC, thus

generating great potential for new discoveries. This is most likely to be attributed to the much 
higher reactivity of propane and/or propane derivatives compared to ethane-derived compounds, 
which renders selectivity control a formidable challenge. Accordingly, selective catalysts for 
ethylene production via EOC, including titanium oxide (TiO2) and bulk CeO2, have been shown 
to generate significant amounts of carbon oxides (COx; selectivity 40% and 70%, respectively) 
when assessed in POC.15 A possible strategy to suppress over-oxidation pathways is to apply the 
concept of redox-site isolation in a quasi-inert matrix in order to better control the surface-active 
oxygen species, thus tuning the oxidizing potential of the catalyst. Metal phosphates represent a 
viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a 
phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds 
compared to bulk metal oxides (Figure 1).19,20 In fact, these systems have been demonstrated as 
effective in several direct alkane oxidation routes, including oxidative dehydrogenation of light 
alkanes,10,21 oxidative coupling of methane,22,23 partial alkane oxidation to oxygenates,24,25 and 
methane oxybromination,26 and could thus open new opportunities for the development of 
selective catalysts for propylene production via oxychlorination chemistry.
Herein, the phosphate of transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) are synthesized, 
characterized, and assessed in POC. Four categories are identified depending on the product 
preferentially generated, and a representative of each class is further evaluated in the oxidation of 
propane and of HCl as well as propyl chloride dehydrogenation, enabling to extract kinetic 
parameters that correlate to activity and selectivity patterns in POC. Detailed characterization of 
the samples elucidates on the structural and morphological stability of the catalysts upon 
exposure to the reaction environment. Finally, CrPO is found as the most selective system, 
reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date.

2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Catalyst Preparation. Commercial cobalt phosphate (CoPO) was calcined in static air. 
Vanadium phosphate (VPO) was prepared by (i) refluxing a suspension of V2O5 and H3PO4 with 
a molar P:V ratio of 1.2 in isobutanol and benzyl alcohol, and by (ii) filtering, drying in vacuum, 
and thermally activating in flowing N2 the resulting solid. Copper phosphate (CuPO), manganese 
phosphate (MnPO), and nickel phosphate (NiPO) were synthesized by (i) mixing an aqueous 
solution of CuCl2·2H2O, MnCl2·4H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O with H3PO4 at a molar P:M (M = Cu, 
Mn, Ni) ratio of 2, by (ii) precipitating the solutions via dropwise addition of aqueous NH4OH, 
and (iii) by filtering, washing, drying in vacuum, and calcining in static air the obtained 
precipitate. Titanium phosphate (TiPO) was prepared by (i) reacting TiO2-rutile  with H3PO4 in a 
molar P:Ti ratio of 3, and by (ii) drying and calcining in static air the resulting paste. Chromium 
phosphate (CrPO) was synthesized by (i) mixing stoichiometric amounts of CrCl3·6H2O  and 
KH2PO4 with a solution of NaCH3COO·3H2O at a molar Cr:Na ratio of 0.9, and by (ii) filtering, 
washing, drying, and calcining in flowing air the obtained precipitate. Iron phosphate (FePO) 
was synthesized by (i) mixing an aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and NH4H2PO4  in a molar 
P:Fe ratio of 1, followed by (ii) drying in vacuum and calcination in flowing air. All details 
concerning each step of the synthesis of every material are fully disclosed in the Supporting 
Information. The catalysts are referred to as MPO, where M denotes the specific metal, i.e., Ti, 
V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and PO represents any phosphate structure. It is important to clarify 
that the catalyst nomenclature (MPO) does not imply any phase composition, while it only 
represents the metal present in the material. 
2.2. Catalyst Characterization. N2 sorption at 77 K was performed in order to characterize 
the textural properties of the catalysts, while their crystal phase composition and structural

properties were assessed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy 
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) were conducted to evaluate the morphological and structural stability of the phosphate 
samples upon exposure to the reaction environment Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS) measurements were performed on the CrPO in fresh form and after equilibration in 
propane oxychlorination at different times on stream to determine the stability and composition 
of the catalyst surface upon exposure to the reaction environment. All details concerning each 
technique used to characterize the catalysts are fully disclosed in the Supporting Information.
2.3. Catalyst testing. Propane oxychlorination (C3H8 + HCl + O2), propane oxidation 
(C3H8 + O2), propyl chloride dehydrochlorination (C3H7Cl), and hydrogen chloride oxidation 
(HCl + O2) were performed at ambient pressure in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor setup 
described elsewhere.15 Briefly, the gases: C3H8, HCl, O2, Ar, and He were fed using digital 
mass-flow controllers, and 1-C3H7Cl was dosed using a syringe pump with a water-cooled 
syringe coupled to a vaporizer. A quartz reactor was loaded with the catalyst, and placed in a 
homemade electrical oven. Prior to testing, the bed was heated in a He flow to the desired 
temperature (T = 400-953 K) and allowed to stabilize for at least 30 min before the reaction 
mixture was fed at desired space velocity (FT:Wcat = 6000 cm3 h-1 gcat-1) and feed composition 
(Table 1). All flow units correspond to standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions, i.e., 
273 K and 1 bar. 
All carbon-containing compounds and Ar were quantified on-line via a gas chromatograph 
coupled to a mass spectrometer. Quantification of Cl2 at the reactor outlet was performed by its 
absorption in an impinging bottle filled with 0.1 M KI solution followed by iodometric titration 
of the formed triiodide with 0.01 M sodium thiosulfate solution.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Characterization of the Fresh Catalysts. N2-sorption, X-ray diffraction, and Raman 
spectroscopy were adopted to assess the textural and structural properties of the metal phosphate 
catalysts (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and S1). It is important to clarify that the catalyst nomenclature 
(MPO) does not imply any phase composition, while it only represents the metal present in the 
material. The specific surface areas of the metal phosphate samples were in the range of 3-
16 m2 g-1, with the only exception of VPO that exhibited a higher surface area (30 m2 g-1). 
Excluding MnPO and CuPO, the XRD and Raman spectra of all other phosphate materials 
showed single phases (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and S1). The average crystallite size of the 
identified phases as determined by Scherrer equation were in the range of 31-56 nm (Table 2), 
indicating the high crystallinity of the phosphate samples, with the only exception of NiPO that 
showed crystalline domains within an amorphous matrix (Figure 2a). In particular, VPO, TiPO, 
and NiPO systems displayed the reflections of the corresponding metal pyrophosphates 
(Figure 2a and Table 2). Raman spectroscopy corroborated these observations, as it evidenced 
the characteristic bands of (VO)2P2O7 (925 and 1186 cm-1) and TiP2O7 (252, 1040, 1075, and 
1163 cm-1),29-30 while over NiPO only one band at 480 cm-1 was observed (Figure 2b and 
Table S1), corroborating the lower crystallinity of this sample. The latter is characteristic of 
phosphate structures, since it is generally ascribed to symmetric bending modes ( 2) of OPO

explaining its presence in the Raman spectra of virtually all metal phosphate samples 
investigated in this study (Figure 2b and Table S1). Similarly, the XRD patterns of CrPO, 
FePO, and CoPO displayed only reflections from the corresponding metal orthophosphates, 
which was corroborated by the detection of the typical Raman bands of -CrPO4 (305, 557, 945, 
1082, and 1201 cm-1),32 FePO4 (272, 433, and 1010 cm-1),33 and Co3(PO4)2 (147, 335, 610, 964, 
and 1011 cm-1),34 respectively (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and S1). On the contrary, the XRD pattern 
of CuPO evidenced the reflections of Cu3P and non-stoichiometric Cu16O14.15 as well as those of 
Cu(OH)2 and Cu3(PO4)2, whose characteristic Raman bands at 495 and 958 cm-1 were observed, 
respectively.35-36 In addition, the spectra showed bands at 279 and 650 cm-1 that suggest the 
presence of CuO and Cu2(PO4)(OH), respectively (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and S1).35,36 Similarly, 
several phases were observed in the diffractogram of the MnPO sample, including MnP4, 
non-stoichiometric -Mn0.98O2, MnP4O11, and  '-Mn3(PO4)2. Accordingly, the Raman spectra 
evidenced bands at 932 and 954 cm-1, which are associated to symmetrical stretching ( 1) mode 
of the PO4 group.37 Additionally, Mn2P2O7 phase is likely present as well, as suggested by the 
detection of a band at 964 cm-1, which typically indicates the  1(PO3) mode of manganese 
pyrophosphate (Figure 2b and Table S1).37 
3.2. Evaluation of Catalysts in Propane Oxychlorination. The activity and product 
distribution of the metal phosphate catalysts in propane oxychlorination, POC, was investigated 
in a wide range of temperatures and feed concentrations (Figure S1). The performance were 
evaluated over the materials that were equilibrated for over 5 h under the reaction environment in 
order to avoid any potential influence from catalyst restructuring (vide infra). The reaction rates 
expressed with respect to the mass of the catalyst (eq. 3) and measured at 723 K under

the metal phosphates (Figure 3a). In essence, the activity in POC decreased in the order CuPO 
>> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO > FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, which is comparable to the activity 
rankings observed for phosphate- and/or oxide-based material of these elements in congeneric 
HCl oxidation and/or methane oxyhalogenation.26,38-40 When comparing to the reaction rates 
based on the surface area of the catalyst (eq. 4), the relative order of activity between CoPO, 
CrPO, FePO, MnPO, NiPO, and TiPO was kept, while CuPO and VPO diverged and were 
classified as the second and fifth most active catalysts, respectively (Figure S2). The difference 
in rankings is likely attributed to the possible non-catalytic reaction pathways that can occur with 
in situ generated molecular chlorine, particularly over CuPO and VPO that are active HCl 
oxidation catalysts, which are not taken into account when considering a surface area-based 
reaction rate. Similar differences in rate-based comparisons were observed in methane 
oxyhalogenation, where gas phase pathways are of significant importance.40 
The selectivity patterns obtained over the catalysts were compared at ca. 20% propane 
conversion (Figure 3b), which is representative of all conditions investigates in this study 
(Figure S1). The selectivity to C3H6 decreased in the order FePO (98%)  CrPO (96%) > 
MnPO (67%)  TiPO (66%)  NiPO (65%)  CoPO (62%) > CuPO (45%) > VPO (31%). Based 
on this criterion, the catalytic systems can be classified into four distinct categories. The first one 
is represented by CrPO and benchmark FePO, which led to the highest selectivity to C3H6, while 
MnPO, TiPO, NiPO, and CoPO represent the second one, which generated a significant fraction 
of cracking products, such as C2H5Cl, C2H3Cl, CH3Cl, and particularly C2H4 and CH4. The third 
and fourth categories are embodied by CuPO and VPO, which yielded substantial amounts of 
chloropropanes (C3H7Cl and C3H5Cl) as well as coke and carbon oxides, respectively

(Figures 3b and S1). Further evaluation of the best performing CrPO under variable conditions 
showed that the high C3H6 selectivity (> 90%) can be preserved over a broad range of 
temperatures (673-773 K) and feed concentration of alkane (1.5-6 vol.%) and HCl 
(1.5-15 vol.%) (Figure 4a). In particular, a single-pass yield of C3H6 up to 50% at 95% 
selectivity could be obtained over CrPO, rivaling the best systems reported to date in POC and 
surpassing any other propylene production technology (Figure 4b).3,6,7,10,11,15,16 Furthermore, this 
catalyst was assessed in a long-term test at moderate propane conversion, evidencing its stable 
catalytic behavior for over 60 h in POC (Figure 5).
3.3. Characterization of the Equilibrated Catalysts. The X-ray diffractograms, Raman 
spectra, and N2-sorption analysis of the catalysts after 5 h equilibration in propane 
oxychlorination showed no changes in the crystal structure, average crystallite size, and textural 
properties in all phosphate samples, excluding CuPO and MnPO (Figure 2 and Tables 2 and 
S1), respectively. This indicates that the vast majority of the investigated metal phosphates are 
stable systems in this reaction from a crystal structure point of view, which is a great challenge 
for many catalysts in halogen chemistry.1 Reflections of only -Cu2P2O7 were observed in the 
XRD pattern of CuPO, which was corroborated by the detection of Raman bands at 358, 411 
( (PO3)) and 1050 cm-1 ( 1(PO3)), as well as at 544 cm-1 and at 1078 and 1145 cm-1, 
representing antisymmetrical bending ( 4) and stretching ( 3) modes of PO3 groups, 
respectively.41 On the other hand, the XRD pattern of MnPO after equilibration in POC 
resembled that of the fresh sample, since MnP4, MnP4O11, and  '-Mn3(PO4)2 phases were 
observed. Still, the reflections of -Mn0.98O2 disappeared, while those of Mn2P2O7 could be 
detected. Accordingly, the Raman spectra evidenced a strong increase in the intensity of the band 
at 964 cm-1, indicating the  1(PO3) mode of Mn2P2O7, as well as the appearance of a band at

1028 cm-1, which represents the antisymmetrical stretching of manganese orthophosphate 
( 3(PO4)).37 Despite the structural changes and the loss of surface area, the morphology of 
MnPO and CuPO was not significantly altered after POC, as assessed by scanning electron 
microscopy (Figure S3). Similar results were observed for VPO (Figure S3), which also showed 
a decrease in surface area (Table 2), and it was taken as representative of all other phosphate 
samples that remained structurally unchanged after POC. 
The SEM micrographs as well as the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of CrPO after 5 and 
62 h equilibration in POC were essentially identical to those of the sample in fresh form 
(Figures 2 and 6), demonstrating its morphological and structural stability in this reaction. This 
was corroborated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, evidencing the 
preservation of the interlattice distances of 2.5 and 3.5 Å (Figures 6 and S4), which correspond 
to the main -CrPO4(112) and -CrPO4(111) planes, respectively, as also observed by XRD. 
Furthermore, the inspection of the HRTEM micrographs revealed a slight decrease in the 
irregularity of the CrPO crystals after the reaction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was 
conducted to probe the surface of the CrPO catalyst prior to and after equilibration in POC. The 
analysis of the Cr 2p, P 2p, and O 1s core level XPS spectra showed no significant alternations 
between the CrPO in fresh form or after 5 and 62 h equilibration in POC (Figures 7a and S5), 
indicating the stability of the catalyst surface in the reaction. This was corroborated by surface 
atomic concentrations that revealed constant Cr:P ratios (ca. 0.85 at.%:at.%) in the fresh CrPO 
and after 62 h in POC (Table S2). Additionally, this surface phosphorous enrichment might 
explain the very low Cr6+ content and the absence of any other coordination states of chromium 
observed by XPS, compared to the typical Cr 2p core level XPS spectra of Cr2O3,42 as well as the 
low oxidizing potential of this catalyst. Finally, chlorine was observed over the catalyst surface

only after equilibration in POC (ca. 0.3 at.%), as indicated by the analysis of the Cl 2p core level 
XPS spectra and surface atomic concentrations (Figure 7b and Table S2). Despite being 
relatively low, the detection of chlorine on the CrPO surface could indicate its role in the 
reaction network of POC. Recent mechanistic studies in ethane oxychlorination, EOC, over 
FePO demonstrated the pivotal role of surface chlorine in driving the reaction towards the 
olefin.18 Additionally, ex-situ XPS study after EOC of FePO, which has similar surface area to 
CrPO, showed a chlorine content of ca. 0.3 at.%, which is directly comparable to that observed 
over CrPO after POC.18
3.4. Rationalization of the Catalytic Performance in Propane Oxychlorination. Previous 
kinetic analysis in POC over several catalysts, including FePO as well as cerium oxide- and 
europium-based systems, have provided strong insights on the mechanism of this reaction, which 
is believed to mainly proceed via catalytic generation of C3H7Cl and its subsequent 
dehydrochlorination into C3H6,15-17 as schematized in Figure 8a. Although the direct catalytic 
formation of C3H6 from propane cannot be excluded, this route is generally considered negligible 
in oxyhalogenation chemistry, as corroborated by the tests in the absence of HCl (vide supra 
Figure 4a) and in agreement with previous studies.15-18 Nevertheless, C3H7Cl could also be 
formed by the non-catalytic reaction of propane with Cl2, which can be generated over the 
catalyst surface by the reaction of HCl and O2 (Figure 8a), as observed over several alkane 
oxyhalogenation systems.40,43 If Cl2 is produced during POC, it will react in the gas phase with 
propane, since the onset of this non-catalytic reaction is ca. 100 K lower in temperature than that 
of POC (Figure S6). This route, however, is not desired as it promotes unselective pathways, 
including polyhalogenation and coking as well as cracking and combustion (Figure 8a), as 
demonstrated in ethane oxyhalogenation over FePO,18 and observed in propane oxybromination

over europium oxybromide (EuOBr).17 Still, regardless of the pathway to generate C3H7Cl, the 
catalyst surface needs to evolve chlorine in the form of C3H7Cl and/or Cl2 for the reaction to 
proceed. Consequently, one system representative of each category, i.e., CrPO, MnPO, CuPO, 
VPO, was evaluated in the oxidation of HCl to Cl2 in order to assess the catalyst ability to evolve 
chlorine (Figure 8b). The activity in this reaction was ranked in the order CuPO > VPO > CrPO 
> MnPO. Furthermore, the temperature at which 10% of HCl is converted in HCl oxidation, 
T10(HCl), was taken as a quantitative measure of the propensity of the catalyst to evolve chlorine, 
which is high if the value of this extracted parameter is low. This temperature was found to 
correlate linearly with the rate of propane consumption in POC at 723 K (Figure 9), indicating 
that the evolution of chlorine from the catalyst surface is a pivotal aspect in the mechanism of 
POC. These findings are in agreement with other studies showing that halogen evolution is a 
critical part of the reaction network of alkane oxychlorination reactions.18,40,43 Interestingly, no 
significant correlation was found between the rate of propane consumption in POC at 723 K 
based on the catalyst surface area and the parameter T10(HCl), as shown in Figure S7. This is in 
agreement with the previous observations on the divergence between the weight-based and 
surface area-based reaction rates (Figure 3a), since the latter does not take into account the 
potential gas phase pathways of alkane activation, likely occurring over VPO and particularly 
CuPO, which are common in halogen chemistry.18,40 
To rationalize the selectivity patterns observed in POC, the representative catalysts of each 
category, i.e., CrPO, MnPO, CrPO, VPO, were investigated in the dehydrochlorination of 
C3H7Cl (Figures 8c and S8) as well as in the oxidation of C3H8 (Figures 8d and S9). The 
former reaction shows the ability of the catalytic systems to produce C3H6 as soon as C3H7Cl is 
present in the reaction medium. The reactivity of the systems was ranked in the order CrPO >>

MnPO  VPO > CuPO. Strikingly, this rank is opposite to that observed in HCl oxidation, which 
indicates that the ability to evolve chlorine anti-correlates with a high propyl chloride 
dehydrochlorination kinetics. This is in agreement with previous findings in EOC over 
FePO4(102), which showed that a highly chlorinated surface is beneficial for olefin generation 
via alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination.18 Similarly to HCl oxidation, the temperature at which 
50% C3H7Cl was converted, T50(C3H7Cl), was taken as a quantitative measure of the catalyst 
propensity to generate C3H6 via C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination, which is high if the value of this 
extracted parameter is low (Figure 8c). On the other hand, C3H8 oxidation was used to probe the 
tendency of the phosphate systems towards alkane cracking in an oxidative environment. In 
particular, the product distribution in this reaction was compared at ca. 15% propane conversion 
(Figure 8d), which showed that MnPO was the only catalyst that produced cracking products 
(C2H4 and CH4), while CrPO and particularly VPO and CuPO mainly resulted into carbon oxides 
(COx) formation. Therefore, the selectivity towards the sum of C2H4 and CH4 in propane 
oxidation, Scracking, was taken as a relative measure of the catalyst propensity towards propane 
cracking under oxidative conditions. Interestingly, the activity in propane oxidation over these 
catalysts was found to be up to four times lower than that in POC, particularly over CuPO, 
MnPO, and CrPO (Figures S1 and S9). These differences could be attributed to possible surface 
structural rearrangements of the metal phosphates upon halogen adsorption, which can allow 
easier alkane activation when spectator halogen species are present, as recently demonstrated in 
EOC over FePO4(102).18 Still, despite some similarities between ethane and propane, a detailed 
mechanistic study, comprising advanced operando techniques as well as DFT calculations, is 
necessary to shed light on the reaction network of POC, which has a higher level of complexity 
compared to that of EOC, and it will be the focus of a future study.

Another important factor that can affect the product distribution is the chlorine evolution 
ability of the catalysts, T10(HCl), as previously anticipated. A recent mechanistic study over a 
FePO4(102) surface in EOC has shown that evolution of chlorine in the form of Cl2 requires 
considerably more energy compared to that of alkyl chloride.18 Consequently, since the 
generation of Cl2 favors polyhalogenation and coking, a good catalyst for propylene production 
should inhibit the evolution of Cl2 and only favor that of propyl chloride, thus having a 
comparatively high value for T10(HCl). All these parameters, i.e., T10(HCl), T50(C3H7Cl), Scracking, 
extracted for CrPO, MnPO, CuPO, and VPO were summarized in a radar plot, as shown in 
Figure 10. Additionally, the selectivity towards COx determined during POC at ca. 20% propane 
conversion, SCOx, was used as a measure of the combustion propensity of the catalysts 
investigated. This kinetic parameter was extracted directly from POC in order to take into 
account the oxidizing potential of materials under HCl-containing conditions, which is known to 
vary drastically if halogens are present in the reaction environment.40 Finally, the selectivity to 
C3H6 obtained in POC at ca. 20% propane conversion was also chosen as axis of the radar plot to 
more clearly show the differences between the catalysts, even if it is not an independent variable. 
Therefore, all the extracted kinetic parameters define an area for each phosphate system within 
the radar plot, which is directly proportional to the catalyst ability to selectively generate 
propylene from propane via oxychlorination chemistry (Figure 10). Accordingly, CrPO 
presented the largest area, and its high selectivity towards C3H6 in POC could be rationalized by 
its low propensity towards cracking and combustion, its moderate ability to evolve chlorine, and 
its strong ability to dehydrochlorinate C3H7Cl into C3H6. Despite MnPO showed the lowest 
chlorine evolution performance and a combustion tendency comparable to CrPO, its high 
propensity towards propane cracking and medium C3H7Cl dehydrochlorination properties limited

C3H6 selectivity in POC. Finally, the low C3H6 selectivity attained during POC over CuPO and 
VPO can be rationalized by their similarly hindered dehydrochlorination ability as well as by 
their respective high tendency to generate Cl2, thus explaining the observed coke formation, and 
strong propensity towards combustion.

4. CONCLUSIONS
We performed a comprehensive assessment of phosphates of transition metals (MPO, M = Ti, 
V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, revealing stark differences 
in the reactivity and particularly in the product distribution as a function of the metal. The 
oxychlorination activity of the catalysts decreased in the order: CuPO >> VPO > CoPO >> CrPO 
> FePO > MnPO  NiPO  TiPO, while the selectivity to propylene ranked as CrPO (95-98%)  
FePO (95-98%) > MnPO (67-85%)  NiPO (65-85%)  TiPO (66-75%) > CoPO (62-70%) > 
CuPO (33-45%) > VPO (30-42%) at 5-20% propane conversion. Accordingly, four categories of 
catalysts have been identified based on the preferred generated product, such as propylene 
(CrPO), cracking products (MnPO, NiPO, TiPO, CoPO), chlorinated hydrocarbons (CuPO), or 
carbon oxides (VPO). In particular, CrPO, whose performance was demonstrated stable for over 
60 h on stream, was identified as the most selective system for POC, reaching up to 50% 
propylene yield, thus rivalling the best catalysts reported to date. Its high stability was 
corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron 
microscopies, which showed no alternations in the structure and morphology after the long-term 
run. Finally, selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were 
assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride 
dehydrochlorination. This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the 
materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene 
is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to 
generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and 
combustion.
