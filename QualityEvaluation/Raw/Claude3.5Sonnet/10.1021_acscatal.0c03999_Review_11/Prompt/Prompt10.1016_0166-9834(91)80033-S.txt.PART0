Abstract 
The reactions of propane with iodine have been evaluated theoreticaiiy in the temperature range 700- 
900 
K. These calculations have been compared with test runs with propane/air in lithium hydroxide/ 
lithium iodide melts. Thermodynamic and kinetic conkderations show that low temperaturea give higher 
propene selectivities. The experimental rem&a confirm this and indicate that the lea&ion pm 
by 
a radicai mechanism. A major factor governing propene r&rctivity is the ratio of normal/isopropyl 
radicals. At the relatively high radical concentrationa encountered in the system, benzene ie the ultimate 
product. Optimizing the iodine/hydrogen iodide-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with 
oxygen for propene or benzene production is feasible.

INTRODUCTION 
The objective 
of this work 
has 
been 
the study 
of an alternative 
route 
for the 
dehydrogenation 
of alkanes, 
especially 
propane. 
Direct dehydrogenation 
(i.e. 
the Star 
or the Oleflex 
process) suffers 
from the disadvantages 
of thermody- 
namic 
limitations 
and 
high 
reaction 
temperatures. 
Oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
may give a higher 
yield at lower 
temperatures. 
Typically, solid catalysts 
like 
vanadium/magnesia 
catalysts give ca. 20% conversion with 60% selectivity 
[ 
11. 
However, 
complete 
combustion 
to CO, may 
easily 
occur. 
Oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
of light alkanes using halogens, 
especially 
io- 
dine, has 
previously 
been explored 
by Shell 
and Petro-Tex [ 21. Iodine is pro- 
duced from a salt melt (lithium iodide) and oxygen. Hydrogen 
iodide is re- 
moved 
by reaction 
with 
lithium 
hydroxide. 
The reactions

If the reactions (l)-(3) 
are performed in one reactor, the total reaction will 
be oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (reaction (4) ). This reaction is ther- 
modynamically very favourable and 100% conversion is expected. However, 
the scheme above is an ideal case; i.e. some CO, will be produced since oxygen 
and propane are present at the same time. 
Another concept is to separate the reactions into several reactors. Iodine 
may be produced in one reactor (reaction (3) ). In the next reactor propane 
can be dehydrogenated by iodine and the hydrogen iodide produced can be 
adsorbed by lithium hydroxide (reaction ( 1) and (2 ) ) . Shell [ 3 
] has patented 
two different single-reactor systems, where the reactions (l)-(3) 
take place 
in different zones in the reactor, and a solid acceptor capable of binding hy- 
drogen iodide as a halide is circulated in the system. 
The high temperature reaction of propane with iodine to form propene and 
hydrogen iodide has been investigated earlier. The radical nature of the reac- 
tions seems to be well established [4,5]. In the present work the oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane is accomplished in the presence of iodine and air. 
The mechanism of the reaction and the process as a whole is further elucidated 
on the basis of experiments as well as from thermodynamic and kinetic 
considerations. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is performed in an alumina tube re- 
actor as shown in Fig. 1. The height from the quartz sinter to the top lock is 20 
cm. The inner diameter of the alumina tube is 3.4 cm. The experiments are 
performed in a lithium hydroxide/lithium iodide salt melt (starting content of 
LiOH = 2-5% ) . Propane and air are introduced continuously from the bottom 
of the reactor. The total gas flow at any time was 400 ml/min. A new gas- 
permeable sinter had to be used for each experiment since the salt melt reacted 
with quartz. During the heating period nitrogen is fed through the reactor in 
order to avoid production of iodine from oxygen and lithium iodide in the re- 
actor. Analysis of the product stream is performed after increasing time on 
stream. 
The contact time of the feed with the melt is estimated to be in the range 
0.1-l 8. The gas mixture remains in the gas phase in the reactor for another 
10-20 8. 
The analytical set up is shown in Fig. 2. Analysis of the product stream is

melt at 6OOC, with a propane& 
mixture of 1: 2 (melt height 5.1 cm). The 
results are given in Table 1. Conversion and selectivities are given in C, units.

As can be seen from the table some benzene is produced, but very low amounts 
of iodinated products are detected under these conditions. 
Dehydrogenation was performed in 2.8 wt.-% LiOH.H,O/LiI 
at 666C with 
propane : air mixtures varying from 1: 1 
to 1: 
4. Even though a 
propane : air mix- 
ture of 1: 
3 and 1: 4 corresponds to an excess of oxygen, assuming 100% 
con- 
version of propane and 100% selectivity to propene, all oxygen is consumed 
during the reaction. As the air content is increased, more CO,, benzene and 
iodinated hydrocarbons are produced. 
The residence time was changed by varying the height of the salt melt. It 
was generally observed that less salt melt gave a higher conversion of propene. 
This is due to the construction of the reactor (see Fig. 1) in that a smaller melt 
height gives a shorter contact time with the melt, but a longer time in the gas 
phase above the melt, and a longer total residence time in the reactor. Thus 
pure gas phase reactions play an important role in our experimental setup. 
Dehydrogenation of propane in 5 wt.-% LiOH*H,O/LiI 
melt at 566C with 
a propane : air mixture 
of 1: 
2 to 1: 
2.5 has been performed (melt height 5.1 cm). 
The results are given in Table 2. 
We see that the main effect of increasing the air/propane ratio is to produce 
more CO,. The large amount of iodine-containing products found at 506C 
points to post-reactor reactions, as these iodated compounds are not stable at 
560  C. They are probably mainly produced during cooling down of the reactor 
effluent. Most of these products could probably be taken out as propene by a 
suitable process modification.

Time in the table is the time from which new conditions (temperature, mixing ratio) are estab- 
lished. The same salt melt is used for one series of experiments. 
A variation 
in the conversion 
and selectivities 
is observed 
when 
comparing 
the results 
at 600C in the last series 
of experiments 
with 
those in Table 1. A 
major 
difference 
between 
the 
experiment 
in Table 2 and 
that in 
Table 1 
is that 
the melt 
in the former 
case 
probably 
contains 
much 
less 
iodine. 
A blank experiment in an empty reactor was performed (SOOC, pro- 
pane 
: air 1: 
2). The conversion 
was almost as high as in a salt melt reactor 
(100% 0, conv., 53% C3HB 
conv.). The selectivities, 
however, 
were 
very dif- 
ferent: 
&He: 34.5%, C&He: 
3.9%, (&HI: 
36.0%, 
CH,: 15.8%, 
COz: 
1.7%, 
CO: 
ca. 
8%. The reaction 
in a blank reactor 
gives 
much 
less 
propene 
and more 
ethene 
compared 
to the salt 
melt reactor. 
Surprisingly, 
no benzene 
was 
observed. 
DISCUSSION 
Catalytic 
experiments 
In all experiments 
the conversion 
of propane initially 
increases 
somewhat, 
but levels 
off to a stable 
value 
later 
on. This may 
have 
to do with 
the 
transport 
of iodine from the melt into the post catalytic 
zone (gas phase in the reactor 
168 
above the melt), thereby enhancing the gas phase reactions. It is evident from 
the presence of iodated products that such reactions play an important role in 
our experiments. 
Increasing the temperature increases the oxygen and propane conversions. 
However, the selectivity to propene decreases at the same time. At higher con- 
versions, coupling of C3 
species to benzene becomes and important side reaction. 
Thermodynamics 
The equilibria for thermodynamic dehydrogenation of propane compared to 
dehydrogenation of propane with iodine is shown in Fig. 3. The maximum 
theoretical conversion of propane with 190% selectivity to propene is calcu- 
lated as a function of the temperature. The effect of reducing the pressure is 
also shown for the direct dehydrogenation. Equilibrium pressure is assumed as 
1 bar. At 900 K, 90% conversion of propane is possible by using iodine. 
The reaction 
HI+LiOH-+LiI+H20 
(5) 
has a rather favourable equilibrium constant, AG= - 70 to - 75 kJ/mol over 
the temperature range 700-1900 K. This means that the total reaction of C&H8 
and I2 
in the presence of LiOH gives close to 100% conversion. 
The production of iodine from lithium iodide, reaction (3), may be a limiting 
factor. 
Assuming a ratio of LiI : LiOH of 1: 1, and a mixture containing 1 part CS, 
two parts N2 and one part HzO, the conversion of oxygen is calculated at dif- 
ferent temperatures and different oxygen initial pressures. The results are given 
in Fig. 4. As we see, almost total conversion of oxygen is feasible for p02 = 0.

lower than 900 K. Thermodynamically, 
this re- 
action 
will 
not 
be the limiting 
step. 
However, 
side 
reactions 
must 
be taken 
into 
account. 
One or more 
of the following 
reactions 
may 
occur:

+ HI 
+ CHJ 
(61 
C,H,-C,H,+CH, 
(71 
2C3H6-C6H,+3H2 
(3) 
Thermodynamically, 
all these reactions give more than 95% conversion at 
temperatures 
as low as 700 
K. At equilibrium 
these 
reactions 
will 
be favoured 
over propene formation. 
The kinetics 
of the different 
reactions 
are 
therefore 
of great 
importance 
to the process. 
Kinetics 
The elementary 
reactions 
participating 
are partly known, partly open for 
estimation, 
and 
partly 
unknown. 
The reaction steps and kinetics of the gross reaction (3) have not, to our 
knowledge, 
been investigated It should 
be a fairly 
fast reaction, 
since 
lithium 
iodide is unstable in air even at 2OOC, 
showing 
visible evolution of iodine. 
Aside 
from 
this reaction, 
which 
is responsible 
for iodine 
production, 
one must 
also 
consider 
the gross 
reaction: 
2HI 
+ 0.50,-+ H,O + IS 
(91 
Haley 
et al. [ 41 claim 
that this reaction 
is also 
rather 
selective 
in the presence 
170 
of hydrocarbons, but these authors obtained a somewhat lower propene selec- 
tivity with oxygen/iodine than with pure iodine. 
If oxygen is present in the gas phase as the reaction products from (1) are 
evolved, this rather 
complicated 
reaction 
would contribute, 
releasing 
hydroxyl-, peroxy- and other oxygen-containing 
radicals into the gas phase. 
These radicals would be expected to be much less selective towards propene 
formation. This can be confirmed from the results of the blank experiment, 
where the selectivities to unwanted products are much higher. 
Ignoring these iodine-producing 
reactions, the relevant reaction steps in- 
volved in the dehydrogenation 
proper are:

Calculations 
[ 61 of the rate constants of (16) and (16a) show that reaction 
(16) is about 100 times faster than reaction (16a) at 990 K. This indicates 
that the n-propyl radical will give mainly cracked products by pure thermal 
reaction, and only a little propene. In our case we can assume that the radicals 
produced in (16)-( 17) react rapidly with iodine or with iodine radicals. At 800 
K and 0.5 atm iodine the equilibrium pressure of iodine radical from reaction 
(10) is 3 mm Hg [ 71. This gives 3.5 mm Hg of iodine radical at 823 K. In the 
temperature interval 790-999 K the iodine radical equilibrium pressure is be- 
tween 2 and 5 mm Hg. 
The creation and fate of the n-propyl radicals seems to be a main factor in 
determining the selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation. 
In Fig. 5 we pres- 
ent estimates for the relative rates of n- and i-propyl radical formation (for 
details see the appendix). 
In the temperature interval 700-900 K reaction (16) is the main reaction, 
in preference to (16a). Reaction (13) can therefore save the n-propyl radical 
from cracking, if reaction (15) is not too fast. The following possible reaction 
pattern for the n-propyl radical may be suggested.

From estimates given in the Appendix (see also Fig. 6), the relative rates 
r1, : -002 
:  
are 1: 0.15 : 0.7 at 823 K, so at this temperature approximately 40% 
of the n-propyl radicals can be expected to crack. As reaction (16) has the 
highest activation energy, this fraction will be lower at low temperature, and 
higher at high temperatures. All this points to the use of low temperatures to 
obtain high selectivity to propene. Our experimental results reflect these the- 
oretical deductions. 
Aromatization 
The conditions that give high conversion of propane will also usually give 
further reaction of propene to benzene (see Tables 1 
and 2). We can expect 
that propene can easily be transformed to ally1 
radicals, these can combine to 
Ce species that, in the next step, quickly generate benzene. Of course, a bimo- 
lecular coupling of ally1 
radicals is not the only way to generate C6 species. 
A diagram for relative selectivity to benzene as a function of propane con- 
version is shown in Fig. 7. This plot has a greater similarity to what one would 
expect from an aromatization that is first-order in propene concentration than 
one that is second-order in propene concentration. This would also indicate 
that the propyl radicals participate in coupling reactions, in accordance with 
earlier suggestions in the literature [

Several

sible:

production 
of C, (from propyl radicals), from propene or from

and cati-

CONCLUSIONS 
Iodine/hydrogen 
iodide catalyzed 
ozidative dehydrogenation 
of propane in 
the presence of oxygen might give interesting 
conversions and selectivities. 
These reactions 
are assumed 
to proceed 
by radical 
mechanisms 
as suggested 
earlier 
[ 41. 
Thermodynamic 
and kinetic 
considerations 
indicate 
that low temperatures 
give 
higher 
propene 
selectivities. 
The experimental 
results 
confirm 
this. 
A ma- 
jor factor governing 
propene 
selectivity 
is the ratio of normal/isopropyl radi- 
cals. At the relatively 
high radical 
concentrations 
encountered 
in the system 
propane/iodine, coupling reactions 
to benzene are observed as the ultimate 
product. 
Optimizing 
this system 
for 
propene 
or benzene 
production 
is feasible.

gives a somewhat low reaction rate.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Describe and compare the various halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene, including dehydrogenation with halogens, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxyhalogenation, and molten metal halide salt approaches. Explain the reaction conditions for each method and analyze why propane's reactivity in these processes differs significantly from that of other alkanes such as methane and ethane.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
