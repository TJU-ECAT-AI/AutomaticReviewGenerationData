Unfortunately, I cannot answer this question based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about halogen-assisted methods for dehydrogenating propane to propene. The literature appears to be about hydraulic fracturing additives and hydrogen sulfide in shale gas, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Without relevant information from the source material, I cannot provide an accurate or reliable answer to the question about propane dehydrogenation methods.
