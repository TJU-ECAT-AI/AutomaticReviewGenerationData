[1] "Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."

[2] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[4] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[5] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: This process is highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive due to iodine costs.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: More reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): Achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K) using low iodine content (≤20%).

4. Traditional propane dehydrogenation: Requires very high temperatures (1000K) due to thermodynamic limitations.

5. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Introduces an oxidant to improve thermodynamics, but yields are limited to about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propene.

The reaction conditions vary significantly among these methods. The dual halogen process offers the best balance of yield and moderate temperature conditions.

Propane's reactivity differs from methane and ethane in these processes due to its molecular structure. As a three-carbon molecule, propane is more reactive than methane and ethane, allowing for easier C-H bond activation. This increased reactivity enables lower operating temperatures for propane dehydrogenation compared to methane or ethane conversion processes. Additionally, the presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane provides more favorable sites for dehydrogenation, contributing to its distinct behavior in these halogen-assisted processes.

文献讨论了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 碘基脱氢：这个过程选择性很高，但需要很高的温度（900K），由于碘的成本而昂贵。

2. 溴基脱氢：比碘更具反应性，但对丙烯和溴丙烷的选择性较低。

3. 双卤素过程（溴-碘混合物）：在适中温度（<800K）下，使用低含量的碘（≤20%）可达到80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷单程产率。

4. 传统丙烷脱氢：由于热力学限制，需要很高的温度（1000K）。

5. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：引入氧化剂以改善热力学条件，但由于丙烯的连续氧化，产率限制在约30%。

这些方法的反应条件差异很大。双卤素过程在产率和适中温度条件之间提供了最佳平衡。

在这些过程中，丙烷的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。作为一个三碳分子，丙烷比甲烷和乙烷更具反应性，允许更容易的C-H键活化。这种增加的反应性使得丙烷脱氢的操作温度比甲烷或乙烷转化过程低。此外，丙烷中存在的仲碳原子为脱氢提供了更有利的位点，这促成了它在这些卤素辅助过程中的独特行为。

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: This method is highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive, limiting its industrial viability.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: More reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): Achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K) using low iodine content (≤20%).

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Introduces an oxidant to make the reaction more thermodynamically favorable, but yields are limited to about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propene to oxygenated products.

Traditional propane dehydrogenation, while theoretically ideal, requires very high temperatures (1000K) for high single-pass conversion due to thermodynamic limitations.

The literature does not explicitly discuss oxyhalogenation or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its unique molecular structure and bond energies. Propane has weaker C-H bonds compared to methane and ethane, making it more reactive in dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, propane's structure allows for the formation of a stable secondary radical intermediate, which facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

The dual halogen process leverages the advantages of both bromine (reactivity) and iodine (selectivity) to achieve higher yields at lower temperatures compared to single-halogen methods. This approach addresses the limitations of using either halogen alone and provides a promising route for selective propane dehydrogenation.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 碘基脱氢：这种方法具有高选择性，但需要很高的温度（900K），成本昂贵，限制了其工业可行性。

2. 溴基脱氢：比碘更具反应性，但对丙烯和溴丙烷的选择性较低。

3. 双卤素工艺（溴-碘混合物）：在中等温度（<800K）下，使用低含量的碘（≤20%）可实现高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷单程产率。

4. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：引入氧化剂使反应在热力学上更有利，但由于丙烯连续氧化为含氧产物，产率仅限于约30%。

传统的丙烷脱氢虽然理论上理想，但由于热力学限制，需要很高的温度（1000K）才能实现高单程转化率。

文献没有明确讨论丙烷脱氢的氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其独特的分子结构和键能。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键较弱，使其在脱氢过程中更具反应性。此外，丙烷的结构允许形成稳定的仲自由基中间体，这有助于脱氢过程。

双卤素工艺利用了溴（反应性）和碘（选择性）的优势，与单卤素方法相比，在较低温度下实现了更高的产率。这种方法解决了单独使用任一卤素的局限性，为选择性丙烷脱氢提供了一条有前景的途径。

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This method introduces an oxidant to make the reaction more thermodynamically favorable, but the highest reported propylene yield is only about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.

5. Traditional propane dehydrogenation: This non-halogen method requires very high temperatures (around 1000K) to achieve high single-pass propane conversion due to thermodynamic limitations.

The literature does not specifically mention oxyhalogenation or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure and bond strengths. Propane has weaker C-H bonds compared to methane and ethane, making it more reactive in dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, propane can form both terminal and internal alkenes (propene and cyclopropane), offering more reaction pathways compared to methane and ethane.

The dual halogen process appears to be the most promising approach, as it combines the selectivity of iodine with the reactivity of bromine, achieving high yields at moderate temperatures. This method overcomes the limitations of using single halogens and traditional oxidative dehydrogenation, making it a potential breakthrough for industrial propylene production.

The reaction conditions vary significantly among these methods:
- Iodine process: 900K
- Bromine-iodine mixture: <800K
- Traditional dehydrogenation: 1000K
- ODH: Not specified, but likely lower than traditional dehydrogenation

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure. As a C3 molecule, propane has weaker C-H bonds at the secondary carbon, making it more reactive than methane or ethane. This allows for lower reaction temperatures in some cases, particularly with the dual halogen process. However, the increased reactivity also makes propane more susceptible to overoxidation in ODH processes, leading to lower yields compared to what might be expected for less reactive alkanes.

The dual halogen process appears to be the most promising approach, combining the selectivity of iodine with the reactivity of bromine at moderate temperatures. This method addresses the limitations of using either halogen alone and achieves significantly higher yields than traditional ODH processes.

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。作为C3分子，丙烷在次级碳原子上的C-H键较弱，使其比甲烷或乙烷更具反应性。这在某些情况下允许使用较低的反应温度，特别是在双卤素过程中。然而，增加的反应性也使丙烷在ODH过程中更容易过度氧化，导致产率低于预期的less反应性烷烃。

双卤素过程似乎是最有前景的方法，它在适中的温度下结合了碘的选择性和溴的反应性。这种方法解决了单独使用任一卤素的局限性，并实现了显著高于传统ODH过程的产率。
