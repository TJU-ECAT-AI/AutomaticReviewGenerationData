[1] "Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."

[2] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[4] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[5] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: This process is highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive due to the cost of iodine.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: Bromine is more reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): This novel approach uses a mixture of bromine and iodine (with low iodine content, no greater than 20%) to achieve up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K).

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): This method introduces an oxidant to make the reaction more thermodynamically favorable, but the highest reported propylene yield is only about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.

5. Traditional propane dehydrogenation: This non-halogen method requires very high temperatures (around 1000K) to achieve high single-pass propane conversion due to thermodynamic limitations.

The literature does not specifically mention oxyhalogenation or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its molecular structure and bond strengths. Propane has weaker C-H bonds compared to methane and ethane, making it more reactive in dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, propane can form both terminal and internal alkenes (propene and cyclopropane), offering more reaction pathways compared to methane and ethane.

The dual halogen process appears to be the most promising approach, as it combines the selectivity of iodine with the reactivity of bromine, achieving high yields at moderate temperatures. This method overcomes the limitations of using single halogens and traditional oxidative dehydrogenation, making it a potential breakthrough for industrial propylene production.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯的方法：

1. 碘基脱氢：这个过程具有高选择性，但需要很高的温度（900K），而且由于碘的成本而昂贵。

2. 溴基脱氢：溴比碘更具反应性，但对丙烯和溴丙烷的选择性较低。

3. 双卤素工艺（溴-碘混合物）：这种新方法使用溴和碘的混合物（碘含量低，不超过20%），在适中的温度（<800K）下可实现高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷的单程产率。

4. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：这种方法引入氧化剂使反应在热力学上更有利，但由于丙烯连续氧化成含氧产物，报告的最高丙烯产率仅约30%。

5. 传统丙烷脱氢：这种非卤素方法由于热力学限制，需要很高的温度（约1000K）才能实现高单程丙烷转化率。

文献没有特别提到丙烷脱氢的氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构和键强度的差异。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键较弱，使其在脱氢过程中更具反应性。此外，丙烷可以形成端位和内部烯烃（丙烯和环丙烷），与甲烷和乙烷相比提供了更多的反应途径。

双卤素工艺似乎是最有前途的方法，因为它结合了碘的选择性和溴的反应性，在适中的温度下实现了高产率。这种方法克服了使用单一卤素和传统氧化脱氢的局限性，使其成为工业丙烯生产的潜在突破。
