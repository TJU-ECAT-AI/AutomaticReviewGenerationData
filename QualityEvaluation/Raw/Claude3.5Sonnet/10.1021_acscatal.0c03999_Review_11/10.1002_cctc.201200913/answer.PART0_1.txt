[1] "Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."

[2] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[4] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[5] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

The literature describes several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: This method is highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive, limiting its industrial viability.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: More reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): Achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K) using low iodine content (≤20%).

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Introduces an oxidant to make the reaction more thermodynamically favorable, but yields are limited to about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propene to oxygenated products.

Traditional propane dehydrogenation, while theoretically ideal, requires very high temperatures (1000K) for high single-pass conversion due to thermodynamic limitations.

The literature does not explicitly discuss oxyhalogenation or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

Propane's reactivity in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its unique molecular structure and bond energies. Propane has weaker C-H bonds compared to methane and ethane, making it more reactive in dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, propane's structure allows for the formation of a stable secondary radical intermediate, which facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

The dual halogen process leverages the advantages of both bromine (reactivity) and iodine (selectivity) to achieve higher yields at lower temperatures compared to single-halogen methods. This approach addresses the limitations of using either halogen alone and provides a promising route for selective propane dehydrogenation.

文献描述了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 碘基脱氢：这种方法具有高选择性，但需要很高的温度（900K），成本昂贵，限制了其工业可行性。

2. 溴基脱氢：比碘更具反应性，但对丙烯和溴丙烷的选择性较低。

3. 双卤素工艺（溴-碘混合物）：在中等温度（<800K）下，使用低含量的碘（≤20%）可实现高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷单程产率。

4. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：引入氧化剂使反应在热力学上更有利，但由于丙烯连续氧化为含氧产物，产率仅限于约30%。

传统的丙烷脱氢虽然理论上理想，但由于热力学限制，需要很高的温度（1000K）才能实现高单程转化率。

文献没有明确讨论丙烷脱氢的氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其独特的分子结构和键能。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键较弱，使其在脱氢过程中更具反应性。此外，丙烷的结构允许形成稳定的仲自由基中间体，这有助于脱氢过程。

双卤素工艺利用了溴（反应性）和碘（选择性）的优势，与单卤素方法相比，在较低温度下实现了更高的产率。这种方法解决了单独使用任一卤素的局限性，为选择性丙烷脱氢提供了一条有前景的途径。
