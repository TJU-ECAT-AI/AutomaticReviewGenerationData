[1] "Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."

[2] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[4] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[5] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: This process is highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive due to iodine costs.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: More reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): Achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K) using low iodine content (≤20%).

4. Traditional propane dehydrogenation: Requires very high temperatures (1000K) due to thermodynamic limitations.

5. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Introduces an oxidant to improve thermodynamics, but yields are limited to about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propene.

The reaction conditions vary significantly among these methods. The dual halogen process offers the best balance of yield and moderate temperature conditions.

Propane's reactivity differs from methane and ethane in these processes due to its molecular structure. As a three-carbon molecule, propane is more reactive than methane and ethane, allowing for easier C-H bond activation. This increased reactivity enables lower operating temperatures for propane dehydrogenation compared to methane or ethane conversion processes. Additionally, the presence of secondary carbon atoms in propane provides more favorable sites for dehydrogenation, contributing to its distinct behavior in these halogen-assisted processes.

文献讨论了几种卤素辅助的选择性丙烷脱氢制丙烯方法：

1. 碘基脱氢：这个过程选择性很高，但需要很高的温度（900K），由于碘的成本而昂贵。

2. 溴基脱氢：比碘更具反应性，但对丙烯和溴丙烷的选择性较低。

3. 双卤素过程（溴-碘混合物）：在适中温度（<800K）下，使用低含量的碘（≤20%）可达到80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷单程产率。

4. 传统丙烷脱氢：由于热力学限制，需要很高的温度（1000K）。

5. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：引入氧化剂以改善热力学条件，但由于丙烯的连续氧化，产率限制在约30%。

这些方法的反应条件差异很大。双卤素过程在产率和适中温度条件之间提供了最佳平衡。

在这些过程中，丙烷的反应性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其分子结构。作为一个三碳分子，丙烷比甲烷和乙烷更具反应性，允许更容易的C-H键活化。这种增加的反应性使得丙烷脱氢的操作温度比甲烷或乙烷转化过程低。此外，丙烷中存在的仲碳原子为脱氢提供了更有利的位点，这促成了它在这些卤素辅助过程中的独特行为。
