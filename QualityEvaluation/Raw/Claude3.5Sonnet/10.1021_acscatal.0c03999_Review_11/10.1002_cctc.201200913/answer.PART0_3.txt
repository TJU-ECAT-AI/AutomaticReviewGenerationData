[1] "Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."

[2] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[4] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[5] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

The literature discusses several halogen-assisted methods for selectively dehydrogenating propane to propene:

1. Iodine-based dehydrogenation: This process is highly selective but requires very high temperatures (900K) and is expensive due to the cost of iodine.

2. Bromine-based dehydrogenation: More reactive than iodine but less selective towards propene and propyl bromide.

3. Dual halogen process (bromine-iodine mixture): Achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of propene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures (<800K) using low iodine content (≤20%).

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH): Introduces an oxidant to make the reaction more thermodynamically favorable, but yields are limited to about 30% due to consecutive oxidation of propene to oxygenated products.

Traditional propane dehydrogenation without halogens requires very high temperatures (around 1000K) due to thermodynamic limitations.

The reactivity of propane in these processes differs from methane and ethane due to its unique molecular structure and bond strengths. Propane has weaker C-H bonds compared to methane and ethane, making it more reactive in dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, the presence of both primary and secondary carbon atoms in propane allows for different reaction pathways and product distributions compared to simpler alkanes.

The literature does not specifically mention oxyhalogenation or molten metal halide salt approaches for propane dehydrogenation.

文献讨论了几种卤素辅助的丙烷选择性脱氢制丙烯的方法：

1. 碘基脱氢：这个过程具有高度选择性，但需要很高的温度（900K），且由于碘的成本而昂贵。

2. 溴基脱氢：比碘更具反应性，但对丙烯和溴丙烷的选择性较低。

3. 双卤素工艺（溴-碘混合物）：在中等温度（<800K）下，使用低碘含量（≤20%）可实现高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷单程产率。

4. 氧化脱氢（ODH）：引入氧化剂使反应在热力学上更有利，但由于丙烯连续氧化成含氧产物，产率仅限于约30%。

传统的不使用卤素的丙烷脱氢由于热力学限制需要很高的温度（约1000K）。

丙烷在这些过程中的反应活性与甲烷和乙烷不同，这是由于其独特的分子结构和键强度。与甲烷和乙烷相比，丙烷的C-H键较弱，使其在脱氢过程中更具反应性。此外，丙烷中同时存在伯碳和仲碳原子，这允许与较简单的烷烃相比有不同的反应途径和产物分布。

文献没有具体提到丙烷脱氢的氧卤化或熔融金属卤化物盐方法。
