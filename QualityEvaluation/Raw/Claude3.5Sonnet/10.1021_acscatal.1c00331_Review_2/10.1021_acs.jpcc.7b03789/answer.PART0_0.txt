The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention briefly that hydrogen cofeeding is used experimentally to reduce coke formation during alkane dehydrogenation. The document focuses more on ethane dehydrogenation rather than propane, and does not go into detail about the mechanisms of how hydrogen affects coke formation, catalyst stability, energy barriers, or other aspects asked about in the question. More specific research on propane dehydrogenation and hydrogen cofeeding effects would be needed to properly address all parts of this question.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于在丙烷脱氢过程中添加氢气的问题。然而,它确实简单提到在烷烃脱氢实验中添加氢气被用来减少积炭的形成。该文档更多地关注乙烷脱氢而非丙烷,并没有详细讨论氢气如何影响积炭形成、催化剂稳定性、能量障碍或问题中提到的其他方面的机制。需要对丙烷脱氢和氢气添加效应进行更具体的研究,才能恰当地解答这个问题的所有部分。
