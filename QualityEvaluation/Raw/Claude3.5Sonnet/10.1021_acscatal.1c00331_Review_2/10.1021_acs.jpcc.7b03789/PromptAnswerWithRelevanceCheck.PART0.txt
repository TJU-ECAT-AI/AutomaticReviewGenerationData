[1] "Company X reported revenue of $12 million in 2021."

[2] "Our previous work on Pt and PtSn alloys has shown that ethylidene isomerization is energetically unfavorable."

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention briefly that hydrogen cofeeding is used experimentally to reduce coke formation during alkane dehydrogenation. The document focuses more on ethane dehydrogenation rather than propane, and does not go into detail about the mechanisms of how hydrogen affects coke formation, catalyst stability, energy barriers, or other aspects asked about in the question. More specific research on propane dehydrogenation and hydrogen cofeeding effects would be needed to properly address all parts of this question.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于在丙烷脱氢过程中添加氢气的问题。然而,它确实简单提到在烷烃脱氢实验中添加氢气被用来减少积炭的形成。该文档更多地关注乙烷脱氢而非丙烷,并没有详细讨论氢气如何影响积炭形成、催化剂稳定性、能量障碍或问题中提到的其他方面的机制。需要对丙烷脱氢和氢气添加效应进行更具体的研究,才能恰当地解答这个问题的所有部分。

[2] "We also found that both hydrogen and ethene compete for the same binding site, leading to enhanced ethene desorption, which is in good agreement with the experimental practice of cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation specifically. However, it does mention that hydrogen cofeeding is used during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation. The mechanism for this involves competition between hydrogen and the alkene product (in this case ethene) for the same binding sites on the catalyst surface. This competition leads to enhanced desorption of the alkene product, which helps reduce coke formation. 

The document does not discuss specific effects on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not provide information on the overall process efficiency and performance implications of hydrogen cofeeding. More detailed research would be needed to fully answer the question for propane dehydrogenation specifically.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢中氢气共进料的详细信息。然而,它确实提到在烷烃脱氢实验中使用氢气共进料来减少积碳形成。其机理涉及氢气和烯烃产物(在本例中为乙烯)在催化剂表面相同结合位点上的竞争。这种竞争导致烯烃产物的脱附增强,有助于减少积碳形成。

文献没有讨论对能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体影响。它也没有提供关于氢气共进料对整体工艺效率和性能影响的信息。需要更详细的研究才能完全回答丙烷脱氢的具体问题。

[2] "Our previous work on Pt and PtSn alloys has shown that ethylidene isomerization is energetically unfavorable."

[3] "As described in previous computational and experimental work, the key to improving dehydrogenation selectivity is loosening the interaction of the ethene with the catalyst surface, permitting its desorption prior to undergoing further reaction via dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide detailed information specifically about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is cofed during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation. The document focuses more on ethane dehydrogenation rather than propane, so it does not discuss the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in PDH. The literature emphasizes that improving dehydrogenation selectivity involves weakening the interaction between the alkene product (in this case, ethene) and the catalyst surface, allowing it to desorb before further reactions occur. This principle may apply to propane dehydrogenation as well, but the document does not provide explicit information on PDH process efficiency and performance in relation to hydrogen cofeeding.

该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的详细信息。然而,它确实提到在烷烃脱氢实验中共进料氢气以减少积碳形成。该文档更多地关注乙烷脱氢而不是丙烷,因此没有讨论氢气共进料对PDH中能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体影响。文献强调,提高脱氢选择性涉及减弱烯烃产物(在本例中为乙烯)与催化剂表面之间的相互作用,使其在进一步反应发生之前脱附。这一原理可能也适用于丙烷脱氢,但该文档没有提供关于氢气共进料对PDH工艺效率和性能影响的明确信息。

The literature does not provide detailed information specifically about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that cofeeding hydrogen is an experimental practice used during alkane dehydrogenation to reduce coke formation. The document indicates that hydrogen competes with ethene for the same binding sites on the catalyst surface, which leads to enhanced ethene desorption. This competition for binding sites likely helps prevent ethene from remaining on the surface long enough to undergo further dehydrogenation reactions that could lead to coke formation.

The literature does not discuss specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding impacts overall process efficiency and performance in PDH. To fully answer the question, more detailed studies focusing specifically on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中氢气共进料的详细信息。但是,它确实提到在烷烃脱氢实验中共进料氢气是用来减少积炭形成的一种实验做法。文档指出,氢气与乙烯在催化剂表面上竞争相同的结合位点,这导致乙烯脱附增强。这种对结合位点的竞争可能有助于防止乙烯在表面停留足够长的时间而发生进一步的脱氢反应,从而导致积炭形成。

文献没有讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、积炭累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体影响。它也没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响PDH整体过程效率和性能的信息。要全面回答这个问题,需要更多专门针对PDH中氢气共进料的详细研究。
