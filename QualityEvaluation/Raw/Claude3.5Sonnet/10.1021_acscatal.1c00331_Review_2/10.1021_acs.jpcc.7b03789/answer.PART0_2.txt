[1] "Cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."

[2] "Our previous work on Pt and PtSn alloys has shown that ethylidene isomerization is energetically unfavorable."

[3] "As described in previous computational and experimental work, the key to improving dehydrogenation selectivity is loosening the interaction of the ethene with the catalyst surface, permitting its desorption prior to undergoing further reaction via dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide detailed information specifically about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is cofed during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation. The document focuses more on ethane dehydrogenation rather than propane, so it does not discuss the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in PDH. The literature emphasizes that improving dehydrogenation selectivity involves weakening the interaction between the alkene product (in this case, ethene) and the catalyst surface, allowing it to desorb before further reactions occur. This principle may apply to propane dehydrogenation as well, but the document does not provide explicit information on PDH process efficiency and performance in relation to hydrogen cofeeding.

该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的详细信息。然而,它确实提到在烷烃脱氢实验中共进料氢气以减少积碳形成。该文档更多地关注乙烷脱氢而不是丙烷,因此没有讨论氢气共进料对PDH中能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体影响。文献强调,提高脱氢选择性涉及减弱烯烃产物(在本例中为乙烯)与催化剂表面之间的相互作用,使其在进一步反应发生之前脱附。这一原理可能也适用于丙烷脱氢,但该文档没有提供关于氢气共进料对PDH工艺效率和性能影响的明确信息。
