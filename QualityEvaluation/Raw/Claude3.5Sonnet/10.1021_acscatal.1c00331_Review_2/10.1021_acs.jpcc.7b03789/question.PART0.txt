Abstract 
The effects of alloying platinum with transition and post-transition metals on the kinetics 
and thermodynamics of dehydrogenation and coke formation pathways during light alkane 
dehydrogenation have been studied using density functional theory. Supported Pt catalysts are 
known to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation, but the high temperatures required by these 
endothermic reactions leads to significant coke formation and deactivation. A limited set of Pt 
alloys have been investigated experimentally previously, with decreases coke formation and 
deactivation. Using periodic density functional theory we have investigated a wider range of Pt-
alloy compositions, including metals from Groups 7-15, to better understand the reduction in 
surface carbon formation and enhanced selectivity during ethane dehydrogenation. The post-
transition metal alloys show the greatest ability to decrease the binding energy of carbonaceous 
species. At low alloy coverage ( ML), these elements affect binding energies primarily through 
electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered. A scaling relation was developed 
between simple CHx species and the barriers for ethene reactions to predict selectivity for ethene 
desorption vs. dehydrogenation. At higher alloy coverage ( ML), geometric effects play an 
important role in surface-adsorbate interactions. There is no global optimum alloying element. 
Rather, the best alloy depends on the alloy coverage. PtPb and PtSb show the most promise at 
low and high alloy coverages respectively. However, this work predicts that PtSn is the 
prevailing industrial catalyst because it shows good performance for both alloy coverages, an 
important property when synthetic control over precise alloy ratio in each metal particle is 
difficult or impractical to attain.

1. Introduction 
Ethane is a common product of industrial hydrocarbon processing including petroleum 
cracking, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and ethane hydrocracking. Interest in obtaining ethene from 
ethane dehydrogenation has increased due to the recent development of shale deposits in North 
America, which are wet, i.e. contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids1. In North 
America, this influx of light alkanes has displaced naphtha cracking as the major source of light 
alkenes. 
There are many methods to dehydrogenate light alkanes from steam cracking to 
dehydrogenation to oxidative dehydrogenation.18 High temperature steam cracking generates 
significant amounts of carbonaceous deposits coating the reactor walls, thus requiring periodic 
reactor shutdowns to remove coke. Oxidative dehydrogenation eliminates hydrogen gas as a 
byproduct due to the water formation. It also suffers from a significant selectivity issue due to 
the competition between the oxidative dehydration reaction and the extremely fast combustion of 
the alkene product. Catalytic dehydrogenation requires lower temperatures than steam cracking, 
which lowers the coke formation. Without oxygen, the dehydrogenation process does not 
compete with the combustion reaction and forms the valuable byproduct, hydrogen gas. 
Among pure metal catalysts, Pt exhibits the highest activity, selectivity, and thermal 
stability for light alkane dehydrogenation,789 but still suffers from significant deactivation due 
to coke formation,1012 and exhibits undesired C-C bond cleavage activity leading to methane13 in 
addition to olefin products. Alloying Pt with Sn has been practiced industrially as a means to 
decrease catalyst deactivation by 60% and reduce deactivation by 50%14 as compared to Pt 
alone. Research has also shown that alloying main group elements such as Ga and In8, 1421 show 
even less deactivation than Sn. Transition metal alloys such as Au,22 Cu,23 and Re24  have also

been investigated as potentially useful alloys. The effect of Sn has been explained as a 
weakening of the bonding between the catalyst surface and the product alkene when compared to 
the pure Pt case, facilitating alkene desorption.1017 In addition to weakening the ethene binding 
energy, the rates of dehydrogenation and C-C bond scission were also decreased. The activation 
energy barrier for dehydrogenation (of ethyl radicals derived from ethane) increased, suggesting 
that the alloy catalysts exhibit a reduction in activity along with an increase in selectivity.11 
Computationally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been a useful tool for explaining 
trends in the experimental data in light alkane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations of decreased 
alkene binding energy PtSn alloys as compared to pure Pt2528 are in good agreement with 
experimental measurements.1012,1517 DFT has shown evidence that coke formation precursors 
on Pt(111) are likely formed through the C-C bond cleavage of alkynes,29 which is highly 
unfavored on PtSn alloys.30 In addition, the activation energy barrier for ethene30 and propylene31 
dehydrogenation, are higher on PtSn alloys than the alkene desorption step, which leads to higher 
alkene selectivity and less coke formation due to alkene dehydrogenation. Calculations on PtAu 
alloys have shown that Au functions as an electron donor,32 and enriching Pt with electrons 
decreases its capability to break C-H bonds.33 
Previously, we have investigated the effect of Sn coverage in PtSn alloys on the predicted 
selectivity towards ethene and coke during ethane dehydrogenation using DFT calculations.30 
Our calculations showed that at  ML Sn coverage, the alloy effect was entirely electronic, as 
three-fold hollow sites of Pt atoms were preserved from the pure Pt surface. Nonetheless, the 
barriers for C-H and C-C bond cleavage were significantly increased, and the binding energy of 
ethene was significantly reduced, suggesting an improvement in selectivity. At a higher Sn 
coverage of  ML, the geometric ensembles of Pt atoms were disrupted and three-fold binding

to Pt atoms was no longer possible, leading to both geometric and electronic effects. The higher 
Sn coverage was predicted to have an even greater improvement in selectivity. This predicted 
selectivity difference is in good agreement with experimentally observed trends of lower coke 
formation with increasing Sn content.14,16,19, 20,34 We also found that both hydrogen and ethene 
compete for the same binding site, leading to enhanced ethene desorption, which is in good 
agreement with the experimental practice of cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation 
experiments to reduce coke formation.12,14,20 
In this work, we have expanded the scope of electronic structure calculations in alkane 
dehydrogenation to other Pt-alloy compositions. We have considered twenty-seven Pt-transition 
metal alloys for metals from Groups 7-11, and Pt-post-transition metal alloys for metals from 12-
15. Binding energies of C1 and C2 species derived from methane and ethane were calculated on 
low ( ML) and high ( ML) coverage surfaces of these alloys, and the alloys grouped 
according to their preferred binding modes. The key selectivity descriptor for ethane 
dehydrogenation is the competition of ethene desorption (desired) with ethene dehydrogenation 
(undesired). The activation energy barrier for ethene dehydrogenation was calculated and 
compared to the ethene desorption energy to predict which alloys would potentially show 
enhanced selectivity to ethene at low and high alloy coverages. The optimal alloy composition 
was predicted to be coverage dependent. A general approach to predicting the selectivity 
descriptor  itself an expensive calculation - was developed using a linear scaling relation with 
the computationally inexpensive calculation of the binding energies simple adsorbates.  
2. Methods 
Periodic, self-consistent DFT calculations were performed using the VASP code35,36

(PAW)38,39 potentials. The single-electron wave functions were expanded using plane waves with 
an energy cutoff of 400 eV. All metal slabs were based on the (111) surface of fcc Pt, and 
modeled by a (2 × 2) surface unit cell with four atomic layers for a total of 16 metal atoms (Pt or 
Sn). A larger (3 × 3) until cell was tested for periodic image interaction effects, but these effects 
were small (< 0.05 eV) and were consistent between adsorbates of different sizes (e.g. 0.006 eV 
difference between ethyl and methyl adsorbates). The choice of a smaller unit cell size therefore 
has a small effect on reported binding energies and a negligible effect on reaction energies. 
To generate the surface substitutional alloys, surface Pt atoms were substituted by Sn and 
the surface structure was reoptimized by relaxation. Substituting one Pt atom with the alloying 
element, M, in the surface layer creating a  monolayer (ML) coverage alloy, and substituting 
two Pt atoms gives  ML coverage. The lattice constant of Pt was calculated to be 3.98 Å, in 
good agreement with experimental value of 3.92 Å.40 A vacuum layer of 12 Å was used to 
separate any two successive slabs in the z direction (normal to the surface), and a dipole 
correction was applied and the electrostatic potential was adjusted to ensure that interaction 
between the surface slab and its periodic images was negligible.41 The Brillouin zone was 
sampled using a (6×6×1) Gamma-centered Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh42 following a 
convergence test for adsorbate binding energies with respect to sampling mesh size. The bottom 
two layers of each metal slab were fixed in their bulk positions while the top two layers were 
allowed to relax in all calculations. Binding energy is defined as BE = Eads  Eslab  Egas, where 
Eads, Eslab, Egas are the total energies calculated for the slab with the adsorbate on it, the clean 
slab, and the adsorbate in the gas phase, respectively. The addition of a single adsorbate 
molecule to a metal slab with a (2 × 2) surface until cell corresponds to  ML adsorbate 
coverage. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method43 was used to calculate

single imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate. 
3. Results and Discussion 
In the dehydrogenation pathway from ethane to ethene, the first C-H bond cleavage step 
results in ethyl species. Being an asymmetric species, dehydrogenation of ethyl leads to two 
possible products: ethylidene and ethylene. Our previous work on Pt and PtSn alloys has shown 
that ethylidene isomerization is energetically unfavorable.30 Further, the introduction of Sn 
increased the ethyl dehydrogenation barriers to both ethylidene and ethene by similar amounts 
due to the similarities in the C-H bond cleavage mechanisms. As such, it is unlikely that any 
alloy will alter the selectivity between ethylidene and ethyl in any significant way. Alloying with 
Sn also increased C-C bond cleavage barriers  as C-C cleavage in ethene was uncompetitive 
with respect to other reactions of ethene, it will similarly not be considered further here. The 
remaining reactions of primary interest are the dehydrogenation of ethene to form vinyl, and the 
desorption of ethene. The reactions described above are summarized in Figure 1, with the 
reaction and activation energy barriers on the Pt(111) surface shown.

As described in previous computational and experimental work, the key to improving 
dehydrogenation selectivity is loosening the interaction of the ethene with the catalyst surface, 
permitting its desorption prior to undergoing further reaction via dehydrogenation.44 Therefore 
the difference between the desorption energy of ethene (Edes) and the activation energy for 
ethene dehydrogenation (Ea,ethene) is a key reactivity descriptor that will be useful to capture the 
intrinsic selectivity of a particular alloy, and in particular for comparing the predicted 
selectivities of different alloys. Here we define the selectivity descriptor as this difference (eq 
1). Edes is equal to absolute value of the binding energy of ethene.  
 
Selectivity Descriptor = Ea,ethene  Edes

The selectivity descriptor defined above appears as the exponential argument of the 
instantaneous selectivity ( 
 ) calculated as the rate of desorption divided by the rate of 
dehydrogenation of ethene. ri and Ai are the rate and pre-exponential factors for reaction i, A0 is 
the ratio of pre-exponential factors, θj is the surface coverage of species j, and * is a surface site.

3.1 Model PtxM/Pt(111) Surfaces 
 
The phase diagrams of Pt alloys form numerous different bulk compositions. Following 
our previous work,30 we have modeled various alloys using a surface substitutional alloy model. 
A (2 × 2) unit cell of fcc Pt(111) with four layers was used as basis for the metal surface. The 
alloys were created by substitution of one surface Pt atom with the alloying element M in the 
case of Pt3M/Pt(111), giving a surface with  ML coverage by M, and substitution of two 
surface Pt atoms with the alloying element M in the case of PtM/Pt(111), giving a surface with

ML coverage. The created surfaces are virtually identical in general appearance to the model 
PtSn alloys from earlier work. 30 
On Pt3M/Pt(111) surfaces, the guest M atoms are isolated from each other. This allows 
for two distinct types of three-fold hollow sites. Small clusters of Pt atoms form three-fold 
hollow sites consisting of three Pt atoms. Around the M atom, the three-fold hollow sites consist 
of two Pt atoms and one M atom. At higher alloy coverage, PtM/Pt(111), the three-fold Pt-only 
sites are removed, and all three-fold binding sites consist of one or two M atoms. 
The selection of alloying element M was made to include all experimentally reported 
alloys investigated for selective alkane dehydrogenation, common alloys of Pt used in catalysis, 
and elements from groups adjacent to these. The 27 elements selected for this study comprise the 
transition metals from Groups 7-11 and the post-transition metals and from Groups 12-15. The 
post-transition metals (P-T) metals included Zn, Cd, Hg, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, and Bi. 
The transition metals were further classified according to preferred binding site for a carbon 
atom. Those transition metal alloys where a carbon atom placed on a Pt3M/Pt(111) surface 
preferred to bind (larger absolute binding energy) to a three-fold hollow with 3 Pt atoms were 
labelled non-preferred transition (NT) metals, because carbon preferentially avoids the guest 
metal atom M. Conversely, transition metal alloys where the carbon atom preferred binding to a 
three-fold hollow with two Pt atoms and one guest M atom instead were labelled carbon-
preferred transition (CT) metals. 
The preferred binding mode for carbon atoms on Pt3M/Pt(111) alloy surfaces for all 
alloys investigated in this this study are summarized in Figure 2. All the P-T metal alloys and the 
NT metal alloys showed the same best binding site, where the carbon atom prefers binding to Pt-
only hollow sites. The NT metals included Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, (Pt), Cu, Ag, and Au. The

binding geometry similarity between P-T and NT alloys permitted simple comparison of the 
electronic effect of the metal atoms, as binding geometries were largely unaltered between these 
alloys as compared to pure Pt at  ML coverage. Nearly all the alloys considered at the low 
coverage were also considered at  ML coverage except the three largest atoms, Bi, Tl, and Pb. 
These three tended to rearrange their surfaces at high coverage in some calculations, and so these 
results were not considered further. The CT metals included Tc, Re, Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir. For all 
alloys, the preferred binding geometry for carbon atoms followed roughly the guest metal atoms 
reactivity relative to platinum. Due to the different preferred binding sites for carbon atoms 
relative to pure Pt and the P-T and NT alloys, the results on the C-T alloys comprise both 
geometric and electronic effects at  ML coverage. 
Those transition metals more reactive than platinum (roughly those falling to the right of 
Pt in Groups 7-9) were CT alloys. The noble transition metals in Groups 11 and palladium were 
NT alloys. The first-row transition metals were a major exception to this general rule. Mn, Fe, 
Co, and Ni would be expected to be more reactive than Pt under normal circumstances  yet the 
preferred binding sites for carbon atoms were consistent with NT alloys. On these surfaces, 
carbon atoms prefer to avoid the guest metal atoms due to their high-spin electronic 
configurations (maximized unpaired electrons in the d orbitals of the guest metal atoms). When 
these four alloy surfaces were calculated without spin polarization, the electronic structure of the 
metals converged to low-spin solutions (maximizing paired electrons in the d orbitals), and 
carbon preferred to bind to the guest atom, similar to the CT alloys.

3.2 Binding of CHx & H species 
 
For  ML and  ML coverage alloys, the binding energies and site preferences of CHx 
and H species are listed in Table 1, Table 2 shows the resulting structures. The binding 
geometries of all NT and P-T surfaces were nearly identical to one another, so Table 2 shows the 
Pt3In/Pt(111) surface as a representative example. The binding geometries of all CT surfaces 
were also nearly identical to one another, and so are represented by Pt3Re/Pt(111) in Table 2. 
The binding preferences of CHx and H species followed a similar trend to that of atomic 
carbon. These species bind preferentially to binding that maximize bonding to Pt atoms on the P-
T and NT alloys, and maximize bonding to sites with M atoms on the CT alloys. Additionally, 
the binding site preference for CHx species is to sites that allow sp3 hybridization at the carbon 
atom, and carbon and hydrogen atoms prefer three-fold hollow sites. Following these rules, the 
binding site preferences in Tables 1 and 2 can be summarized rather concisely. On P-T and NT

alloys H, C, and methylidyne (CH) prefer to bind to three-fold Pt hollows (Pt3) at  ML 
coverage, and three-fold Pt2M hollows at  ML coverage. Methyl (CH3) prefers to bind to Pt top 
sites at both coverages. On CT alloys H, C, and CH prefer to bind to three-fold Pt2M at  ML 
coverage, and three-fold PtM2 hollows at  ML coverage. Methyl (CH3) prefers to bind to M top 
sites at both coverages.  
Alloys from the P-T and NT groupings generally weakened binding relative to Pt(111), 
while CT alloys generally strengthened binding. The P-T alloys had a larger effect on the binding 
energies than the NT alloys. These effects were more pronounced at higher alloy coverages than 
at lower coverages  CT alloys bound these species even more strongly and P-T alloys bound 
these species even more weakly. PtMn alloys did not fit neatly in this trend, with much weaker 
binding energies at low coverage and much stronger binding at higher coverage. As stronger 
binding affinity for these species may be expected to correlate with stronger binding of other 
carbonaceous species as established for PtSn,30 this already suggests that P-T alloys will be 
preferable for higher selectivity during ethane dehydrogenation. Alloy compositions for which 
binding energies for CHx species were stronger than on Pt(111) at  ML coverage were not 
calculated at the higher coverage. This eliminated PtZn among the P-T alloys, and all the NT and 
CT alloys except for PtMn. PtRe, PtCu, and PtAu were also calculated at the higher coverage as 
examples of NT and CT alloys for later calculations.

The selectivity descriptor (eq 1)and the reaction pathway to ethene involve three C2Hx 
species, ethyl (C2H5), ethene (C2H4), and vinyl (C2H3), whose binding energies and site 
preferences on select alloy surfaces are given in Table 3. The choice of alloys investigated here 
was partly influenced by the results of the scaling relations in Section 3.6, and so only a subset of 
those alloys in Table 1 appear here. As with CHx species, the C2Hx species were generally more 
stable when their carbon atoms were in sp3 hybridization geometries regardless of alloy and alloy 
coverage. Also, the binding geometries avoided C-M bonds for P-T and NT alloys, and 
maximized C-M bonds in CT alloys regardless of coverage. Ethyl and ethene species showed 
little variability in their binding geometries across all surfaces (Table 4a). Both carbon atoms 
were in sp3 hybridization with a single-bond character to the C-C bond. Ethyl bound to the 
surface via a top site above Pt atoms for P-T and NT alloys, and a top site above the guest metal 
atom for CT alloys regardless of coverage  binding modes consistent with the carbon atom 
binding preferences discussed in Section 3.1 above. Ethene bound to two top sites on Pt atoms on 
P-T and NT alloys regardless of alloying element coverage. On CT alloys, ethene bound to top 
site pairs above Pt and M atoms at low coverage of M, but at higher coverage were able to bind 
to two M atom top sites due to the proximity of M atoms. These binding structures are given in 
Table 4a. 
The vinyl species showed more variability in binding modes than the other species, 
particularly at  ML coverage. On P-T and NT alloys at low coverage, vinyl species bound to 
the surface with sp3 hybridization with the CH2 group on a Pt top site and the CH group in a 
bridging geometry between two Pt atoms. On CT alloys, the binding mode was similar, with the 
CH group bridging between a Pt atom and an M atom, and the CH2 group atop Pt at low 
coverage and atom M at high coverage. On P-T and NT alloys at  ML coverage, the binding

geometries varied significantly, as seen in Table 4b. Several alloys maintained the sp3 
hybridization, and varied the orientation of the molecule. On PtMn, the CH2 group bonded to the 
guest metal atom, while the CH group bridged two Pt atoms. The much stronger binding energy 
on this alloy compared to the other alloys is attributed to the high-spin electronic structure. PtGa 
adopted a similar binding geometry to PtMn, but with a binding energy similar to the other, low-
spin alloys. On PtCu, PtAu, PtCd, PtAl, and PtGe, the CH2 group preferred a Pt atom instead, 
forcing the CH group to bridge a Pt-M atom pair, leading to a distorted geometry and a shortened 
C-C bond, indicating more double-bond character. In contrast to all the preceding examples, 
where vinyl bound in a bidentate η2 mode, on PtHg, PtIn, PtSn, and PtSb, vinyl bound in an η1 
fashion where the carbon atoms retained sp2 hybridization and a Pt atom took the place of the 
missing H atom on the CH group. This binding geometry led to significantly weakened binding 
energy. As the geometric ensembles in the surface layer of the alloy were identical, a significant 
ligand effect of the guest M atoms was responsible for the changes in binding geometries.  
As PtSn alloys are commercially relevant light alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, and 
PtIn has been reported to be of significant interest in experimental studies,20 the binding energy 
and binding geometry of the vinyl species can be expected to have a significant role in 
determining the ultimate selectivity of the catalyst at high alloy coverage. Since dehydrogenation 
is energetically uphill (Table 5), a late transition state  one more resembling the final state than 
the initial state in an elementary reaction  may be expected. For the ethene dehydrogenation 
reaction (Section 3.4), this suggests that the structure of adsorbed vinyl will influence the 
activation energy barrier, Ea,ethene, and therefore the selectivity descriptor (eq 1). It should be 
noted that the binding energy of ethene (BEC2H4) =  Edes.

3.4 Ethene Dehydrogenation Mechanism 
 
The selectivity (and selectivity descriptor) of a particular surface is a strong function of 
how much more difficult it is to remove hydrogen from ethene than it is to remove ethene from 
the surface. The C-H bond cleavage barriers for ethene, Ea,ethene, on select alloys at high and low 
coverage were calculated and are given in Table 5. Due to the higher computational cost of 
nudged elastic band calculations for computing barriers relative to structure optimization 
calculations reported throughout the rest of this work the number of alloy surfaces considered 
here was kept small, and the alloys tested were in part selected from the analysis in Section 3.6. 
Since the high binding energies observed on CT alloys in Sections 3.2-3.3 suggested poor 
selectivity for CT alloys, they were not considered here. 
At  ML alloy coverage, the reaction mechanism on P-T and NT alloys were visually 
similar, and the initial, transition, and final states are represented in Figure 3 by PtIn. The 
similarities in transition states for the different alloys can be seen in Table S1. The differences in 
barriers and reaction energies between the alloys can be attributed to a combination of the 
electronic ligand effects and strain effects (especially for the larger M atoms) of the guest metal 
atoms. Ga and Au lowered the barrier to dehydrogenation, while the remaining alloys increased

the barrier, though the effects were small. The barrier on Pt(111) was 0.90 eV, and the largest 
barrier at  ML alloy coverage was 1.12 eV for Pt3Bi, and most of the alloys were within 0.1 eV 
of the Pt value. As would be expected for a late transition state reaction, the reaction energies 
followed a similar trend to Ea,ethene, in that the range was small, and Pt3Bi had the most 
endothermic reaction at  0.68 eV, compared to 0.32 for Pt.

At higher alloy coverage, the dehydrogenation reaction mechanisms for the different 
alloys no longer coincided, as seen in the variety of transition state structures in Table S1. The 
structure of product state vinyl radical, as noted in Section 3.3, played a determining factor in the 
transition state structure and reaction mechanism for this endothermic late transition state

reaction. The PtHg, PtIn, PtSn, and PtSb alloys were predicted to be promising based on the 
structure of the adsorbed vinyl radical, and all showed significantly larger barriers than Pt(111) 
by 0.51-0.59 eV. The barrier on PtGa was also calculated, and was found to be comparable to the 
P-T alloys mentioned above. While the barriers for these alloys were all within a small 0.08 eV 
range, the reaction energies showed more variation with a range of 0.27 eV. At this higher 
coverage, Au also effectively raised the barrier for ethene dehydrogenation  whereas at low 
coverage it has lowered the barrier  but only by 0.37 eV relative to Pt(111).

3.5 Selectivity 
The binding energies and barriers from Tables 3 and 5 allow the calculation of the 
selectivity descriptors (eq 1) for those alloys were activation barriers were calculated and are 
given in in Table 6. At  ML alloy coverage, PtPb had the highest selectivity descriptor at 0.84 
eV. That is to say that cleaving the C-H bond in ethene was calculated to be 0.84 eV more 
difficult than desorbing the ethene, suggesting that this surface would show a low preference for 
coke formation pathways and a higher selectivity towards gaseous ethene. This compares 
favorably to PtSn, which is used commercially, for which the selectivity descriptor at low 
coverage was 0.37, and very favorably compared to pure Pt(111), for which the selectivity 
descriptor was negative, indicating a preference for coke formation pathways ethene desorption. 
PtAu and PtGa also had negative selectivity descriptors. Of the other alloys calculated, PtBi and

PtTl also showed large values for Ea,ethene  Edes, while the remaining alloys calculated were 
similar to Pt Sn, albeit slightly poorer. 
Increasing the alloy coverage improved the selectivity descriptor for all alloys, and even 
alloys with negative selectivity descriptors at low coverage were more favorable at high 
coverage. The three best low-coverage alloys, Pb, Bi, and Tl could not be evaluated at higher 
coverage with the current alloy model due to their large atomic radii as discussed in Section 3.1. 
The selectivity descriptor of PtSn improved to 1.05 eV at the higher coverage. The selectivities 
for the alloys of Hg, In, and Sb improved by larger amounts, such that all three were slightly 
more selective than PtSn at the higher coverage, with PtSb at 1.18 eV. It should be noted that the 
ordering of the selectivities at low coverage did not match the ordering at high coverage. For 
example, PtSb was the best P-T alloy calculated at high coverage, but the worst (excepting PtGa) 
at lower coverage. 
These results suggest that it is possible to improve upon the intrinsic selectivity of the 
PtSn alloy, but the choice of alloying element depends strongly on the coverage of the alloying 
element in the surface of the synthesized metal alloy nanoparticles. If low coverage prevails, 
PtPb shows promise, as do PtBi and PtTl. At high coverage, PtSb appears the best, followed 
closely by PtIn and PtHg.45 However, PtSn represents the best compromise that may reflect 
conditions in industrial catalyst manufacturing. When tight control over the ratio of elements in 
the catalyst particle surfaces is not achievable or is not sought, the best alloy may be one that 
performs well at any alloy concentration. In fact, many nanoparticle synthesis techniques 
produce a distribution of alloy concentrations across different particles, and so both high and low 
coverages will be present in a real catalyst powder or particle concurrently. In this regard, PtSn is 
a strong choice at both low and high alloy coverages.

3.6 Scaling Relations  
Due to the high computational cost of calculating barriers and sampling many binding 
geometries of C2Hx species, the selectivity descriptor in eq 1 is not easily computed over a large 
range of alloys and concentrations. Even in this study, only a subset of alloys was calculated 
using DFT. As such, scaling relationships were developed to accurately predict both parts of the 
selectivity descriptor: the ethene desorption energy (Edes) and the ethene dehydrogenation 
barrier (Ea,ethene). To minimize the computational cost of the calculations required to accurately 
predict selectivity, correlations were sought with simple data sets computed with DFT for CHx 
species and requiring only structure optimization calculations.  
A separate scaling relation for each term of the selectivity descriptor was sought. For the 
desorption energy (i.e. -binding energy) of ethene, a correlation was with the binding energy of a 
methyl group (BECH3) on the same surface. In both bound ethene and methyl groups, carbon 
atoms are sp3 hybridized, species bind to top sites, and the binding preferences between a Pt 
atom and a guest metal atom are preserved for both species. That is, P-T and NT alloys have both 
ethene and methyl bound to Pt atoms, while CT alloys prefer binding through the guest metal

atom. These factors contribute to a reasonably linear scaling relation between Edes and BECH3, 
as seen in Figure 4 for both high and low coverage of the alloying element. Other species that 
bind to top sites gave similarly good correlations, such as between ethyl and methyl groups. 
Correlation between Edes and other CHx species was also tested, such as carbon, but was poorer 
than with methyl. This indicates that the nature of the binding site (i.e. a top site or a three-fold 
hollow) is important in the predictive power of the calculation. The equation for the line 
correlating Edes and BECH3 for the lower coverage alloys is given below, where α1 and β1 are 
the slope and intercept, with values of -1.64 and -2.40 eV respectively. 
 
Edes = α1BECH3 + β1

Finding a scaling relation for Ea,ethene was less straightforward. The BrnstedEvans
Polanyi relation has been extensively used to relate reaction energies to activation energy 
barriers4648. Typically, one might correlate the barrier for ethene dehydrogenation to the reaction 
energy for dehydrogenation. Instead, a relation that relied only on the binding energy 
calculations of simple CHx species would be much more computationally efficient, and so a

representative C-H bond-cleaving step was desired. Ea,ethene is the difference in energy between 
the transition state and adsorbed ethene. An analysis of the bonding changes between these 
structures suggests a reasonable set of variables to use for the correlations. As seen in Figure 3, 
between the initial and transition states a C-H bond is weakened, and a Pt-H bond is forming, 
and a second new bond will form between carbon and platinum. Among reactions of CHx 
species, methylidyne dehydrogenation is the simplest because the reaction does not involve the 
breaking or formation of any C-M or C-Pt bonds, so that the C-H bond breaking and Pt-H/M-H 
bond formation energies can be isolated, as both the reactant and product involve carbon in a 
three-fold hollow site. 
CH* +* C* + H*    
While reaction energy for methylidyne dehydrogenation, ECH, includes the breaking of 
the C-H bond and the formation of the Pt-H bond, it does not adequately account for the nascent 
interaction between carbon and platinum in the transition state of ethene dehydrogenation. To 
account for this interaction, it was found that adding BECH3 to ECH accounted for the changes 
in bonding encapsulated in Ea,ethene, such that a linear correlation between the sum and the barrier 
was found. The correlation for the lower alloy coverage of  ML, given in Figure 5, was only 
possible because the transition state structures in all these alloys were so similar. CT alloys were 
left out of this correlation, as Ea,ethene values were not calculated for these alloys, and their 
transition state structures would be expected to differ from the P-T and NT alloys due to the 
different initial and final state structures (Table 4a).  
At  ML coverage by the alloying element, the transition state structures varied to such 
an extent (see Table S1) as to make a simple correlation impossible - a separate correlation 
would be needed for each reaction mechanism, and the mechanism followed by a particular alloy

would not be known a priori. The structure of the vinyl adsorbate (obtained from a structure 
minimization calculation) was predictive of the transition state structure (obtained from the more 
expensive transition state searching calculation), but the authors felt that the value of separate 
correlations for much smaller subsets of metal alloy surfaces would be of little value. For this 
reason, no further correlations on the high alloy coverage surfaces were sought. The equation for 
the line correlating Ea,ethene and BECH3 and ECH for the lower coverage alloys is given below, 
where α2 and β2 are the slope and intercept, with values of 0.46 and 1.53 eV respectively. 
 
Ea,ethene = α2(BECH3 + ECH) + β2

As the values for BECH3 and ECH were calculated previously in populating Table 3 
(summarized in Table 7), eq 3 and eq 4 can be used to predict values of Edes and Ea,ethene from a 
scaling relation that were not calculated by DFT, saving significant computational expense. 
These are included in Table S2. Since the selectivity descriptor eq 1 is simply the difference 
between Ea,ethene and Edes, subtracting eq 3 from eq 4 results in a scaling relation between

(5) 
With this scaling relation, the selectivity for each alloy considered at the simplest level of 
DFT calculation (binding of CHx species only) could be predicted, and the alloys ranked from 
most promising to least promising (Table 7). Many alloys were predicted to be more selective 
than pure Pt, and the alloys of Pb, Bi, and Tl were predicted to be more selective than PtSn. With 
the exception of Au, only P-T alloys were predicted to be more selective than Pt, and even then 
Au was only slightly more selective. The remaining NT transition metals were predicted to be 
less selective than pure Pt(111). Some high spin alloys such as Fe and Mn did not fit the trend 
formed by the remaining alloys, and so are not included in Table 7. The CT alloys are omitted as 
the parameters in (eq 5) were developed without CT alloy data.  
Table 7 shows predictive power for selectivity in low coverage alloys, as the DFT values 
(when available) are in good agreement with the scaling relation. Due to the lack of correlation 
for activation energy barriers at the higher coverage alloys, a similar scaling relation could not be 
made. While it is tempting to predict that the relative ordering of the alloys would not change 
between low and high coverage, this was not the case as seen even in the relatively small number 
of DFT-calculated selectivity descriptors in Table 6. This illustrates that scaling relations to 
predict selectivity can be coverage dependent for binary metal alloy surfaces.

a Calculated from the selectivity predictor scaling relation eq 5. 
b Calculated from DFT values obtained from Tables 3 and 5. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Density functional theory was applied to determine the effects of alloying Pt with various 
transition and post-transition metals on the selectivity towards ethene during ethane 
dehydrogenation. The binding energies and geometries of CHX species were calculated on a 
range of Pt3M/Pt(111) and PtM/Pt(111) surface substitutional alloys. A scaling relation was 
found between values obtained from these simpler calculations and the key surface properties 
controlling selectivity towards ethene. These relations permitted the prediction of the ethene 
desorption energy and the ethene dehydrogenation activation energy barrier, both more complex 
and computationally expensive calculations. Together, the scaling relation was used to predict 
the selectivity of the different alloys at low alloying element coverage and rank them from most 
promising to least. All the most promising alloys were post-transition metal alloys, with Pb, Bi, 
and Tl showing a potentially significant improvement in selectivity compared to PtSn, the 
commercial catalyst. A similar approach for higher coverage alloys failed due to the mechanism

of ethene dehydrogenation varying across the different alloys, such that a linear relation could 
not be formed as with the lower coverage alloys, indicating that scaling relations are not 
universal and are coverage dependent. 
The post-transition metal alloys showed the greatest ability to decrease the binding 
energy of carbonaceous species. At low alloy coverage ( ML), these elements affected binding 
energies primarily through electronic effects, leaving binding geometries unaltered. At higher 
alloy coverage ( ML), geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate 
interactions. 
Selectivity was found to be dependent on alloy coverage. When  of surface sites were 
occupied by post-transition metal atoms, Pb, Bi, and Tl were predicted to be more selective than 
Pt or even than PtSn. While alloys with Sb, In, and Hg showed less promise than PtSn at low 
coverage, at  ML coverage they were predicted to have higher selectivity. However, this work 
predicts that PtSn is the prevailing industrial catalyst because it shows good performance for 
both alloy ratios, an important property when synthetic control over precise alloy ratio in each 
metal particle is difficult or impractical to attain.
