          "Cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."
          
          "We also found that both hydrogen and ethene compete for the same binding site, leading to enhanced ethene desorption, which is in good agreement with the experimental practice of cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."
          
          "As described in previous computational and experimental work, the key to improving dehydrogenation selectivity is loosening the interaction of the ethene with the catalyst surface, permitting its desorption prior to undergoing further reaction via dehydrogenation."
          
          "Experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."
          
          "This predicted selectivity difference is in good agreement with experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."

          The literature does not provide detailed information specifically about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it mentions that hydrogen cofeeding is used during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation. The mechanism involves competition between hydrogen and the alkene product (ethene in this case) for the same binding sites on the catalyst surface. This competition leads to enhanced desorption of the alkene product, which helps reduce coke formation.

          The key to improving dehydrogenation selectivity is weakening the interaction between the alkene product and the catalyst surface, allowing it to desorb before further reactions occur. This principle may apply to propane dehydrogenation as well.

          The document does not discuss specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in PDH. It also does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding impacts overall process efficiency and performance in PDH. To fully answer the question, more detailed studies focusing specifically on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

          Additionally, the literature mentions that increasing Sn content in catalysts leads to lower coke formation, which is related to improved selectivity.

          该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中氢气共进料的详细信息。然而,它提到在烷烃脱氢实验中使用氢气共进料来减少积炭形成。其机理涉及氢气和烯烃产物(在本例中为乙烯)在催化剂表面相同结合位点上的竞争。这种竞争导致烯烃产物的脱附增强,有助于减少积炭形成。

          提高脱氢选择性的关键是减弱烯烃产物与催化剂表面之间的相互作用,使其在进一步反应发生之前脱附。这一原理可能也适用于丙烷脱氢。

          文献没有讨论氢气共进料对PDH中能量障碍、积炭累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体影响。它也没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响PDH整体过程效率和性能的信息。要全面回答这个问题,需要更多专门针对PDH中氢气共进料的详细研究。

          此外,文献提到增加催化剂中的Sn含量会导致较低的积炭形成,这与改善选择性有关。
