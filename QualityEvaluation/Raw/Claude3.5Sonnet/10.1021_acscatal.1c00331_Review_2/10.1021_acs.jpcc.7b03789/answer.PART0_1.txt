[1] "Cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."

[2] "We also found that both hydrogen and ethene compete for the same binding site, leading to enhanced ethene desorption, which is in good agreement with the experimental practice of cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."

The literature does not provide detailed information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation specifically. However, it does mention that hydrogen cofeeding is used during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation. The mechanism for this involves competition between hydrogen and the alkene product (in this case ethene) for the same binding sites on the catalyst surface. This competition leads to enhanced desorption of the alkene product, which helps reduce coke formation. 

The document does not discuss specific effects on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not provide information on the overall process efficiency and performance implications of hydrogen cofeeding. More detailed research would be needed to fully answer the question for propane dehydrogenation specifically.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢中氢气共进料的详细信息。然而,它确实提到在烷烃脱氢实验中使用氢气共进料来减少积碳形成。其机理涉及氢气和烯烃产物(在本例中为乙烯)在催化剂表面相同结合位点上的竞争。这种竞争导致烯烃产物的脱附增强,有助于减少积碳形成。

文献没有讨论对能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体影响。它也没有提供关于氢气共进料对整体工艺效率和性能影响的信息。需要更详细的研究才能完全回答丙烷脱氢的具体问题。
