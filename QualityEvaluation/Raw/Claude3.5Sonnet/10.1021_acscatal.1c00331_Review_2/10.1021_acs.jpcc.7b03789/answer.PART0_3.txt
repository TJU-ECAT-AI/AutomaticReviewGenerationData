The literature does not provide detailed information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation specifically. However, it does mention that hydrogen cofeeding is used in alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation. The text indicates that hydrogen and ethene compete for the same binding sites on the catalyst surface, which leads to enhanced ethene desorption. This competition for binding sites helps explain why hydrogen cofeeding reduces coke formation.

The document does not provide specific details on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not discuss the implications for overall process efficiency and performance in propane dehydrogenation. To fully answer the question, more information would be needed on these specific aspects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation.

文献中没有提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢过程中的详细信息。然而,它确实提到在烷烃脱氢实验中使用氢气共进料来减少积碳形成。文本指出,氢气和乙烯在催化剂表面上竞争相同的结合位点,这导致乙烯的脱附增强。这种对结合位点的竞争有助于解释为什么氢气共进料可以减少积碳形成。

文档没有提供氢气共进料如何影响能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体细节。它也没有讨论这对丙烷脱氢过程的整体效率和性能的影响。要全面回答这个问题,还需要更多关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢中这些具体方面的信息。
