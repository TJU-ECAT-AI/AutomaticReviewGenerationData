[1] "Experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."

[2] "This predicted selectivity difference is in good agreement with experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."

[3] "We also found that both hydrogen and ethene compete for the same binding site, leading to enhanced ethene desorption, which is in good agreement with the experimental practice of cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."

The literature does not provide detailed information specifically about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that cofeeding hydrogen is an experimental practice used during alkane dehydrogenation to reduce coke formation. The document indicates that hydrogen competes with ethene for the same binding sites on the catalyst surface, which leads to enhanced ethene desorption. This competition for binding sites likely helps prevent ethene from remaining on the surface long enough to undergo further dehydrogenation reactions that could lead to coke formation.

The literature does not discuss specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding impacts overall process efficiency and performance in PDH. To fully answer the question, more detailed studies focusing specifically on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中氢气共进料的详细信息。但是,它确实提到在烷烃脱氢实验中共进料氢气是用来减少积炭形成的一种实验做法。文档指出,氢气与乙烯在催化剂表面上竞争相同的结合位点,这导致乙烯脱附增强。这种对结合位点的竞争可能有助于防止乙烯在表面停留足够长的时间而发生进一步的脱氢反应,从而导致积炭形成。

文献没有讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、积炭累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体影响。它也没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响PDH整体过程效率和性能的信息。要全面回答这个问题,需要更多专门针对PDH中氢气共进料的详细研究。
