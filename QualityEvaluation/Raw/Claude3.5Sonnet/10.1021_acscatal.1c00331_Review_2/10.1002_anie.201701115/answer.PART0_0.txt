[1] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."

[2] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

[3] "The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

The literature does not specifically discuss hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding water vapor to the feed. 

Water vapor cofeeding is shown to significantly suppress coke formation during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. When water vapor was added, the coke content on the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst remained very low at 0.5 wt% after a 6-hour run at 680°C. In contrast, without water vapor, the coke content increased to 2.8 wt% and catalyst conversion decreased.

The study does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization patterns. It also does not discuss the impact of hydrogen on reaction mechanisms or overall process efficiency. The focus is primarily on the beneficial effects of water vapor in reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst stability.

这篇文献没有具体讨论在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气的影响。相反,它主要关注向进料中添加水蒸气的效果。

研究表明,在高温下进行丙烷脱氢时,添加水蒸气可以显著抑制积碳的形成。当添加水蒸气时,PtSn/CeO2催化剂在680°C下运行6小时后,积碳含量保持在很低的0.5 wt%。相比之下,如果不添加水蒸气,积碳含量会增加到2.8 wt%,并且催化剂的转化率也会下降。

这项研究没有提供关于添加氢气如何具体影响能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化模式的信息。它也没有讨论氢气对反应机理或整体过程效率的影响。研究主要集中在水蒸气在减少积碳形成和维持催化剂稳定性方面的有益效果。
