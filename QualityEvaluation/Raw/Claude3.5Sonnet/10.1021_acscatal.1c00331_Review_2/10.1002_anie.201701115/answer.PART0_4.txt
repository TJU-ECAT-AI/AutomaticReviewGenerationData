[1] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."

[2] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[3] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

[4] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

The literature does not specifically discuss hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Instead, it focuses on the effects of water vapor cofeeding. According to the text, adding water vapor to the feed almost completely suppresses coke formation. The catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after a 6-hour run at 680°C when water vapor is co-fed. Without water vapor, the coke content increased significantly (from 0.5 to 2.8wt%) and conversion dropped.

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not discuss the impact of hydrogen on catalyst stability or reaction mechanisms in the PDH process. Therefore, the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on these aspects cannot be determined from the given information.

该文献并未具体讨论在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气的影响。相反，它主要关注了共进料水蒸气的效果。根据文本，向进料中添加水蒸气几乎完全抑制了焦炭的形成。当共进料水蒸气时，催化剂在680°C下运行6小时后显示出很低的焦炭含量(<1wt%)。没有水蒸气时，焦炭含量显著增加(从0.5增加到2.8wt%)，转化率也下降了。

文档没有提供氢气共进料如何影响能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的信息。它也没有讨论氢气对PDH过程中催化剂稳定性或反应机理的影响。因此，无法从给定信息确定氢气共进料对这些方面的具体影响。
