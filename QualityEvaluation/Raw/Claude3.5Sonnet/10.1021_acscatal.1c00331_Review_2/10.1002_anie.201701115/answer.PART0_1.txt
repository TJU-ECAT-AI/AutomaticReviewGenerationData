[1] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."

[2] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

[3] "The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

The literature does not directly discuss hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Instead, it focuses on the use of water vapor to suppress coke formation. The addition of water vapor to the feed almost completely suppresses coke formation during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. When water vapor was not added to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased significantly from 0.5 to 2.8 wt%, and the conversion of propane decreased. 

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not discuss the impact of hydrogen on catalyst stability or reaction mechanisms. Therefore, the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on these aspects of the PDH process cannot be determined from the given information.

Given the lack of information on hydrogen cofeeding, it is not possible to draw conclusions about its implications for overall process efficiency and performance based on this literature alone. Further research specifically addressing hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be necessary to answer these aspects of the question.

该文献并没有直接讨论氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的作用。相反，它主要关注使用水蒸气来抑制焦炭形成。向进料中添加水蒸气几乎完全抑制了在高温下丙烷脱氢过程中的焦炭形成。当没有向PtSn/CeO2催化剂添加水蒸气时，焦炭含量显著增加，从0.5增加到2.8重量百分比，而且丙烷的转化率下降。

文档没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的信息。它也没有讨论氢气对催化剂稳定性或反应机理的影响。因此，无法从给定信息中确定氢气共进料对PDH过程这些方面的具体影响。

鉴于缺乏有关氢气共进料的信息，仅基于这篇文献无法得出其对整体过程效率和性能影响的结论。要回答这些问题，需要进行专门针对PDH中氢气共进料的进一步研究。
