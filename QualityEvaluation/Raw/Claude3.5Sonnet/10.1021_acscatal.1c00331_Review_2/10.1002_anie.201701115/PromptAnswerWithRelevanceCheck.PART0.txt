[1] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."

[2] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

[3] "The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not specifically discuss hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding water vapor to the feed. 

Water vapor cofeeding is shown to significantly suppress coke formation during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. When water vapor was added, the coke content on the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst remained very low at 0.5 wt% after a 6-hour run at 680°C. In contrast, without water vapor, the coke content increased to 2.8 wt% and catalyst conversion decreased.

The study does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization patterns. It also does not discuss the impact of hydrogen on reaction mechanisms or overall process efficiency. The focus is primarily on the beneficial effects of water vapor in reducing coke formation and maintaining catalyst stability.

这篇文献没有具体讨论在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气的影响。相反,它主要关注向进料中添加水蒸气的效果。

研究表明,在高温下进行丙烷脱氢时,添加水蒸气可以显著抑制积碳的形成。当添加水蒸气时,PtSn/CeO2催化剂在680°C下运行6小时后,积碳含量保持在很低的0.5 wt%。相比之下,如果不添加水蒸气,积碳含量会增加到2.8 wt%,并且催化剂的转化率也会下降。

这项研究没有提供关于添加氢气如何具体影响能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化模式的信息。它也没有讨论氢气对反应机理或整体过程效率的影响。研究主要集中在水蒸气在减少积碳形成和维持催化剂稳定性方面的有益效果。

The literature does not directly discuss hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. Instead, it focuses on the use of water vapor to suppress coke formation. The addition of water vapor to the feed almost completely suppresses coke formation during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. When water vapor was not added to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased significantly from 0.5 to 2.8 wt%, and the conversion of propane decreased. 

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not discuss the impact of hydrogen on catalyst stability or reaction mechanisms. Therefore, the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on these aspects of the PDH process cannot be determined from the given information.

Given the lack of information on hydrogen cofeeding, it is not possible to draw conclusions about its implications for overall process efficiency and performance based on this literature alone. Further research specifically addressing hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be necessary to answer these aspects of the question.

该文献并没有直接讨论氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的作用。相反，它主要关注使用水蒸气来抑制焦炭形成。向进料中添加水蒸气几乎完全抑制了在高温下丙烷脱氢过程中的焦炭形成。当没有向PtSn/CeO2催化剂添加水蒸气时，焦炭含量显著增加，从0.5增加到2.8重量百分比，而且丙烷的转化率下降。

文档没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的信息。它也没有讨论氢气对催化剂稳定性或反应机理的影响。因此，无法从给定信息中确定氢气共进料对PDH过程这些方面的具体影响。

鉴于缺乏有关氢气共进料的信息，仅基于这篇文献无法得出其对整体过程效率和性能影响的结论。要回答这些问题，需要进行专门针对PDH中氢气共进料的进一步研究。

The literature does not specifically discuss hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process. Instead, it focuses on the effects of water vapor addition. Water vapor is shown to significantly suppress coke formation during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. When water vapor was not added to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased substantially from 0.5 to 2.8 wt%, and catalyst conversion decreased. The addition of water vapor helps maintain catalyst stability by minimizing coke accumulation.

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not discuss the implications of hydrogen addition on overall process efficiency and performance. To properly answer these aspects of the question, additional information or studies specifically addressing hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

[1] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."

[2] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents. The coke deposited on the sample is reported in Table1. All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

[3] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."
