[1] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."

[2] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

[3] "The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

The literature does not specifically discuss hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation process. Instead, it focuses on the effects of water vapor addition. Water vapor is shown to significantly suppress coke formation during propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures. When water vapor was not added to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased substantially from 0.5 to 2.8 wt%, and catalyst conversion decreased. The addition of water vapor helps maintain catalyst stability by minimizing coke accumulation.

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also does not discuss the implications of hydrogen addition on overall process efficiency and performance. To properly answer these aspects of the question, additional information or studies specifically addressing hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

该文献并没有具体讨论在丙烷脱氢过程中添加氢气的影响。相反，它主要关注了水蒸气添加的效果。研究表明，在高温下进行丙烷脱氢时，水蒸气的添加能显著抑制积碳的形成。当没有向PtSn/CeO2催化剂中添加水蒸气时，积碳含量大幅增加，从0.5增至2.8重量百分比，同时催化剂的转化率也下降了。添加水蒸气有助于通过最小化积碳累积来维持催化剂的稳定性。

文献中没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的信息。它也没有讨论氢气添加对整体工艺效率和性能的影响。要正确回答这些问题，需要额外的信息或专门研究丙烷脱氢过程中氢气共进料的影响。
