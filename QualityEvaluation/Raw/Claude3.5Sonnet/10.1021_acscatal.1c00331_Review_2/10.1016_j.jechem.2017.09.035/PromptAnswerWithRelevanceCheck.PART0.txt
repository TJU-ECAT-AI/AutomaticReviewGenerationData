<quotes>

[1] "After loading Pt-Sn, the surface area and pore volume of 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-fresh decreased compared with those of Al2O3 support, indicating that metal particles partially blocked the pores derived from Al2O3 support."

[2] "Although light adsorbed species containing more H was also removed by H2 purging, the resulting coke deposition over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2-1 still possessed the lower C/H ratio, showing that hydrogenation of the coke occurred."

[3] "This coke with higher H content presents higher mobility. It is most likely that the stubborn coke on or beside the metal sites, which has great impact on the catalytic performance, would be transformed by hydrogenation to get fluidity, migrating away from the metal sites to the support or becoming a more loose attachment to the metal sites."

[4] "This transformation of the coke could enhance the accessibility of the metal active centers and reduce the restriction of reactant adsorption and product desorption. As a result, the catalyst regenerated by H2 presented more stability."

The literature does not directly address hydrogen cofeeding during the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. However, it does discuss the effects of hydrogen regeneration on coke formation and catalyst stability, which may have some relevance to hydrogen cofeeding.

Hydrogen regeneration was found to have several beneficial effects on the catalyst:

1. It removed light adsorbed species from the catalyst surface.

2. It hydrogenated the remaining coke, resulting in a lower C/H ratio.

3. The hydrogenated coke had higher mobility, allowing it to migrate away from metal active sites or form looser attachments.

4. This transformation of the coke enhanced the accessibility of metal active centers and reduced restrictions on reactant adsorption and product desorption.

5. As a result, catalysts regenerated with hydrogen showed improved stability.

While these findings are specific to hydrogen regeneration, they suggest that hydrogen cofeeding during PDH might have similar beneficial effects on coke formation and catalyst stability. Hydrogen cofeeding could potentially hydrogenate coke as it forms, keeping it mobile and preventing it from blocking active sites. This could lead to improved catalyst stability and longer run times between regenerations.

However, the literature does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding might affect reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, or acid site conversions. Further research would be needed to fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance in PDH.

该文献并未直接讨论在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中共进料氢气的影响。然而，它确实讨论了氢气再生对积碳形成和催化剂稳定性的影响，这可能与氢气共进料有一些相关性。

研究发现氢气再生对催化剂有几个有益的影响：

1. 它去除了催化剂表面的轻质吸附物种。

2. 它使剩余的积碳氢化，导致C/H比降低。

3. 氢化后的积碳具有更高的迁移性，使其能够远离金属活性位或形成更松散的附着。

4. 积碳的这种转变增强了金属活性中心的可及性，并减少了对反应物吸附和产物脱附的限制。

5. 因此，用氢气再生的催化剂表现出更好的稳定性。

虽然这些发现是针对氢气再生的，但它们表明在PDH过程中共进料氢气可能对积碳形成和催化剂稳定性有类似的有益影响。氢气共进料可能会在积碳形成时将其氢化，使其保持移动性并防止其阻塞活性位点。这可能会导致催化剂稳定性提高和再生之间的运行时间延长。

然而，该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料如何影响反应机理、能量障碍或酸性位点转化的信息。需要进一步研究以全面了解氢气共进料对PDH整体过程效率和性能的影响。
