[1] "PDH was carried out at 873 K for 15 h. The initial conversions of 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst were 28.6 and 25.9, respectively, and the final conversions after 15 h were decreased to 22.8 and 20.0 %, respectively."

[2] "PDH was performed at 873 K and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 53,000 mL/gcat h. The temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and CO chemisorption of the KPtSn catalysts with K added revealed the potassium addition blocked the acid sites, promoted the reduction of Sn oxide and decreased the Pt dispersion."

[3] "The coke formation after the reaction was 1.12 wt%, which was the highest among the prepared catalysts. The deactivation parameters are closely related to the coke amount after 5 h of reaction."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study focuses on the effects of potassium addition to PtSn catalysts without mentioning hydrogen cofeeding. The document discusses catalyst deactivation, coke formation, and reaction conditions, but does not explore how hydrogen cofeeding impacts these factors or the overall PDH process efficiency and performance.

To fully answer this question, additional research on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be necessary. The current study provides insights into catalyst composition and performance but does not cover the specific aspects of hydrogen cofeeding mentioned in the question.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的影响。研究主要集中在钾添加对PtSn催化剂的影响,而没有提到氢气共进料。文档讨论了催化剂失活、积碳形成和反应条件,但并未探讨氢气共进料如何影响这些因素或整个PDH过程的效率和性能。

要全面回答这个问题,需要对PDH中的氢气共进料进行额外研究。当前的研究提供了有关催化剂组成和性能的见解,但并未涵盖问题中提到的氢气共进料的具体方面。
