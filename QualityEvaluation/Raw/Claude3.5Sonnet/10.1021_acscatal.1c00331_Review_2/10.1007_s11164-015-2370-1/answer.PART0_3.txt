[1] "PDH was carried out at 873 K for 15 h. The initial conversions of 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst were 28.6 and 25.9, respectively, and the final conversions after 15 h were decreased to 22.8 and 20.0 %, respectively."

[2] "The deactivation parameters were almost similar in both catalysts. The C3= selectivity in 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst was 87.6 and 92.2 % after 15 h of reaction, respectively."

[3] "PDH was performed at 873 K and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 53,000 mL/gcat h."

[4] "The products of C1C2 included methane, ethane and ethylene, which could be produced on the hydrocracking sites on the Pt metal species."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The study focuses on the effects of potassium addition to PtSn catalysts rather than hydrogen cofeeding. The document mentions using a feed composition of 3:2 for C3H8:H2, but does not discuss the specific impacts of hydrogen on coke formation, catalyst stability, or reaction mechanisms. 

To fully answer this question would require information beyond what is provided in the given literature. The study does not explore the impact of hydrogen on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in the PDH process. Therefore, the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance cannot be adequately addressed based solely on the information provided in this document.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的影响。该研究主要关注钾的添加对PtSn催化剂的影响,而不是氢气共进料的影响。文献中提到使用3:2的C3H8:H2进料比例,但没有讨论氢气对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性或反应机理的具体影响。

要全面回答这个问题需要超出本文献所提供的信息。该研究并未探讨氢气对PDH过程中能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响。因此,仅基于本文档中提供的信息,无法充分讨论氢气共进料对整个过程效率和性能的影响。
