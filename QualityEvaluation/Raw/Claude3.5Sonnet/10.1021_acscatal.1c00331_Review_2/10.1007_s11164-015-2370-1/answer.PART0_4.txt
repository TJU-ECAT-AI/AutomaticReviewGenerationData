[1] "PDH was carried out at 873 K for 15 h. The initial conversions of 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst were 28.6 and 25.9, respectively, and the final conversions after 15 h were decreased to 22.8 and 20.0 %, respectively."

[2] "The C3= selectivity in 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst was 87.6 and 92.2 % after 15 h of reaction, respectively."

[3] "PDH was performed at 873 K and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 53,000 mL/gcat h."

[4] "The formations of cracking products and higher hydrocarbons on acid sites were suppressed by the K effect of blocking the acid sites."

The provided literature does not directly discuss the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study focuses on the effects of potassium addition to PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalysts in PDH without mentioning hydrogen cofeeding. The literature describes the reaction conditions, including temperature and gas hourly space velocity, but does not mention hydrogen as part of the feed. It discusses catalyst stability, coke formation, and selectivity in relation to potassium addition rather than hydrogen cofeeding. Therefore, the specific question about hydrogen cofeeding effects cannot be answered based on the information provided in this literature.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的影响。该研究主要关注钾的添加对PtSn/h-Al2O3催化剂在PDH中的影响，而没有提到氢气共进料。文献描述了反应条件，包括温度和气体时空速度，但没有提到氢气作为进料的一部分。它讨论了催化剂稳定性、积碳形成和选择性与钾添加的关系，而不是氢气共进料的影响。因此，基于这篇文献提供的信息，无法回答关于氢气共进料效应的具体问题。
