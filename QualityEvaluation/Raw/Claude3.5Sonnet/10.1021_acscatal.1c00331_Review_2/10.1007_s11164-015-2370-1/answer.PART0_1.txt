[1] "PDH was carried out at 873 K for 15 h. The initial conversions of 00-KPtSn and 14-KPtSn catalyst were 28.6 and 25.9, respectively, and the final conversions after 15 h were decreased to 22.8 and 20.0 %, respectively."

[2] "The C3= selectivity of the 00-KPtSn catalyst was 89.0/89.0 % for Si/Sf, while that of the 14-KPtSn catalyst was 92.9/92.6 %."

[3] "PDH was performed at 873 K and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 53,000 mL/gcat h. The temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and CO chemisorption of the KPtSn catalysts with K added revealed the potassium addition blocked the acid sites, promoted the reduction of Sn oxide and decreased the Pt dispersion."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study focuses on the effects of potassium addition to PtSn/h-Al2O3 catalysts in PDH, without discussing hydrogen cofeeding. 

However, the document provides some insights into catalyst stability and coke formation in PDH without hydrogen cofeeding. It shows that potassium addition to PtSn catalysts can improve catalyst stability and reduce coke formation by blocking acid sites and suppressing the formation of higher hydrocarbons. The study also mentions that potassium addition affects the reduction of Sn oxide and Pt dispersion, which could influence reaction mechanisms.

To fully answer the question about hydrogen cofeeding effects, additional research specifically addressing hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be necessary.

这篇文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响。该研究主要关注钾的添加对PtSn/h-Al2O3催化剂在PDH中的影响，没有讨论氢气共进料。

然而，该文献提供了一些关于PDH过程中催化剂稳定性和积碳形成的见解，但未涉及氢气共进料。研究表明，向PtSn催化剂中添加钾可以通过阻塞酸性位点和抑制高碳氢化合物的形成来提高催化剂稳定性并减少积碳形成。研究还提到，钾的添加会影响氧化锡的还原和铂的分散度，这可能会影响反应机理。

要全面回答关于氢气共进料效果的问题，需要进行专门针对PDH中氢气共进料的额外研究。
