[1] "PDH was carried out at 873 K at atmospheric pressure using 0.080 g of the catalyst after the H2 reduction. The internal diameter (i.d.) of the fixed bed tubular quartz reactor was 10 mm, and the catalyst bed length between the quartz wool layers in the reactor was approximately 34 mm. Before each experiment, the sample was reduced in a pure hydrogen (99.99 %) flow (30 mL min-1)."

[2] "After the reduction, C3H8:H2 feed gases with a molar ratio of 3:2 were introduced into the catalytic reactor for the reaction, and the total gas flow rate was maintained constant at 30 mL min-1."

[3] "The coke formation on the 00-KPtSn) catalyst (the Sn addition to Pt) was much lower than that on the 13-KPt catalyst (the K addition to Pt). The 0.14 wt% K addition to the 00-KPtSn catalyst suppressed the coke formation on the 00-KPtSn significantly, but K addition at more than 0.49 wt% rather increased the coke formation."

The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used in the reaction feed and for catalyst reduction.

The study used a 3:2 molar ratio of C3H8:H2 in the feed gas, indicating hydrogen was cofed during PDH. This suggests hydrogen cofeeding is a standard part of the PDH process, likely to help maintain catalyst activity and stability.

The paper notes that coke formation was lower on the PtSn catalyst compared to the Pt-only catalyst, and that small amounts of potassium addition further suppressed coke formation. This implies that catalyst composition plays an important role in coke suppression, but the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation are not discussed.

The literature does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding impacts energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. Additionally, it does not directly address the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance in PDH.

To fully answer the question, more specific research on the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。但是,它确实提到氢气被用于反应进料和催化剂还原。

研究使用3:2的C3H8:H2摩尔比作为进料气体,表明PDH过程中确实使用了氢气共进料。这表明氢气共进料是PDH过程的标准部分,可能有助于保持催化剂的活性和稳定性。

论文指出,与单纯的Pt催化剂相比,PtSn催化剂上的积碳形成较少,少量钾的添加进一步抑制了积碳形成。这意味着催化剂组成在抑制积碳方面起着重要作用,但未讨论氢气共进料对积碳形成的具体影响。

文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响能量势垒、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的信息。此外,它也没有直接讨论氢气共进料对PDH整体过程效率和性能的影响。

要全面回答这个问题,需要对PDH中氢气共进料的影响进行更具体的研究。
