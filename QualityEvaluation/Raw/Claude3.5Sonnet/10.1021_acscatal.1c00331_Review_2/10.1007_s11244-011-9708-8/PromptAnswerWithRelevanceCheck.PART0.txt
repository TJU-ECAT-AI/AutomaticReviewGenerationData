[1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "It is noted here that although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact. In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

[4] "Hydrogen promotes while hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke. These results are in good agreement with the shift of Peak II in Figs. 1 and 2."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation suppression: Hydrogen addition greatly reduces overall coke formation. Higher hydrogen content in the feed leads to less coke accumulation on the catalyst.

2. Impact on acid sites: Hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, which further reduces coke formation rate.

3. Coke characteristics: While hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it significantly changes the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressures, the coke becomes less dense and compact.

4. Softening effect: Hydrogen can soften the coke formed on the metal through hydrogenation.

5. Inhibition of aromatic coke: Hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke, which is typically harder to remove and more detrimental to catalyst performance.

These effects have several implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation and softening existing coke, hydrogen cofeeding can extend catalyst lifetime and maintain activity for longer periods.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The inhibition of side reactions leading to coke formation may improve selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

3. Reduced regeneration frequency: Less coke accumulation means less frequent need for catalyst regeneration, leading to improved process economics and reduced downtime.

4. Lower energy requirements: Softer, less dense coke may be easier to remove during regeneration, potentially reducing the energy required for this process.

5. Optimized process conditions: Understanding the role of hydrogen allows for better tuning of reaction conditions to balance coke formation with desired product yield.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH processes can significantly enhance catalyst performance and process efficiency by mitigating coke formation and its negative impacts.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation and catalyst stability:

1. Coke suppression: Increasing hydrogen content in the feed greatly reduces overall coke formation. This improves catalyst stability by reducing deactivation due to coking.

2. Acid site conversion: Hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites. This reduces coke formation rate on the support.

3. Coke properties: Higher hydrogen partial pressure results in coke that is less dense and compact, particularly on metal surfaces. The coke formed has a higher hydrogen content and can be further softened through hydrogenation.

4. Metal vs. support effects: Hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal itself, but significantly impacts coke formation on the support.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst lifetime: Reduced coking leads to slower catalyst deactivation, extending the time between regeneration cycles.

2. Enhanced selectivity: Less coke formation may improve selectivity towards desired products.

3. Easier regeneration: Softer, less compact coke is likely easier to remove during catalyst regeneration.

4. Process optimization: The differential effects of hydrogen on metal and support coking allow for potential fine-tuning of reaction conditions to balance desired activity and stability.

5. Energy considerations: While hydrogen addition suppresses coking, it may impact the overall thermodynamics and energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding offers a powerful tool for controlling coke formation and improving catalyst performance in PDH processes, but requires careful optimization to balance its various effects on reaction mechanisms and process efficiency.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation suppression: Increasing hydrogen content in the feed greatly reduces overall coke formation. This effect is more pronounced on the support than on the metal surfaces.

2. Catalyst stability improvement: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst stability, potentially extending the catalyst's lifetime and reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke, particularly on the support. It also weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, further reducing coke formation rates.

4. Coke characteristics: Higher hydrogen partial pressures result in less dense and compact coke. The coke formed on metal surfaces can be softened through hydrogenation, potentially making it easier to remove during regeneration.

5. Energy barriers: While not explicitly mentioned, the inhibition of coke formation and conversion of acid sites suggest that hydrogen cofeeding may lower energy barriers for desired reactions while increasing barriers for coke-forming reactions.

6. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen affects coke formation differently on metal and support surfaces. It has a stronger inhibitory effect on coke formation on the support compared to the metal surfaces.

These effects have several implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity, reducing downtime and regeneration costs.
2. Potential for higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity due to reduced coke-induced deactivation.
3. Possibility of operating at higher temperatures or lower pressures without excessive coking, potentially improving process economics.
4. Need for optimizing hydrogen partial pressure to balance coke suppression with desired PDH reactions.
5. Potential for developing more efficient catalyst designs that leverage the beneficial effects of hydrogen cofeeding.
