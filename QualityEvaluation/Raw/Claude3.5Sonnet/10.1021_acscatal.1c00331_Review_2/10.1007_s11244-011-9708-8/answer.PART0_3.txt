[1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "Although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact. In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

[4] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation suppression: Hydrogen addition greatly reduces overall coke formation. As hydrogen content increases, the total amount of coke decreases substantially.

2. Impact on acid sites: Hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, which further reduces coke formation rate on the support.

3. Coke characteristics: While hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it significantly changes the hydrogen content in the coke. Higher hydrogen partial pressure results in less dense and compact coke. The coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation.

4. Differential effects on metal and support: Hydrogen pressure weakly affects coke formation rate on the metal but decreases the rate of coke formation on the support.

These effects have several implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding can extend catalyst lifetime and maintain activity for longer periods.

2. Enhanced selectivity: Reduced coke formation can lead to improved selectivity towards desired products.

3. Longer run times: Less coke accumulation allows for extended operation times between regeneration cycles.

4. Tunable process: By adjusting hydrogen partial pressure, the process can be optimized for desired coke characteristics and formation rates.

5. Energy considerations: While hydrogen addition suppresses coke formation, it may affect the overall thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction, potentially requiring process adjustments.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding offers a powerful tool for managing coke formation and improving PDH process performance, but requires careful optimization to balance its various effects on the reaction system.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中添加氢气对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有显著影响，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 抑制焦炭形成：添加氢气大大减少了总体焦炭形成。随着氢气含量的增加，焦炭总量显著降低。

2. 对酸性位点的影响：氢气通过将Brønsted酸性位点转化为Lewis酸性位点来减弱载体的酸性，从而进一步降低载体上的焦炭形成速率。

3. 焦炭特性：虽然氢气压力对金属上的结焦速率影响不大，但显著改变了焦炭中的氢含量。较高的氢分压会导致焦炭密度和紧实度降低。金属上形成的焦炭可以通过加氢进一步软化。

4. 对金属和载体的差异影响：氢气压力对金属上的焦炭形成速率影响较弱，但会降低载体上的焦炭形成速率。

这些影响对过程效率和性能有以下几个方面的意义：

1. 提高催化剂稳定性：通过减少焦炭形成，添加氢气可以延长催化剂寿命并维持更长时间的活性。

2. 提高选择性：减少焦炭形成可以提高对目标产物的选择性。

3. 延长运行时间：焦炭积累减少允许在再生周期之间延长操作时间。

4. 可调节过程：通过调整氢分压，可以优化过程以获得所需的焦炭特性和形成速率。

5. 能量考虑：虽然添加氢气抑制了焦炭形成，但可能会影响脱氢反应的整体热力学，可能需要进行过程调整。

总的来说，添加氢气为管理焦炭形成和改善PDH过程性能提供了一个强有力的工具，但需要仔细优化以平衡其对反应系统的各种影响。
