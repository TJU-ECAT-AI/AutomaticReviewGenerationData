[1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "It is noted here that although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact."

[4] "In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation suppression: Adding hydrogen to the feed greatly reduces overall coke formation. Higher hydrogen content leads to less coke accumulation on the catalyst.

2. Catalyst stability improvement: By suppressing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain catalyst activity and stability over time.

3. Acid site conversion: Hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites. This conversion reduces coke formation rates on the support.

4. Coke characteristics: While hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it significantly changes the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressures, the coke becomes less dense and compact.

5. Coke softening: Hydrogen can further soften the coke formed on the metal through hydrogenation.

6. Energy barriers: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, hydrogen cofeeding likely affects energy barriers for various reactions, including coke formation and propane dehydrogenation.

7. Graphitization: The text doesn't directly address graphitization, but the changes in coke characteristics (density, compactness) suggest that hydrogen cofeeding may influence the degree of graphitization.

These effects have important implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity: Reduced coke formation and softer coke characteristics lead to extended catalyst life and fewer regeneration cycles.

2. Enhanced process stability: Less coke accumulation results in more stable operation and consistent product yields.

3. Potential trade-offs: While hydrogen cofeeding suppresses coke formation, it may also affect the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, potentially reducing propylene yield.

4. Optimized process conditions: The balance between hydrogen content, coke formation, and product yield needs to be carefully optimized to maximize overall process efficiency.

5. Energy considerations: The addition of hydrogen may impact the energy balance of the process, potentially requiring adjustments in heat management strategies.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH processes offers significant benefits in terms of coke suppression and catalyst stability, but its implementation requires careful consideration of various process parameters to achieve optimal performance and efficiency.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有显著影响，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 抑制焦炭形成：向进料中添加氢气可大大减少总体焦炭形成。氢气含量越高，催化剂上积累的焦炭越少。

2. 提高催化剂稳定性：通过抑制焦炭形成，氢气共进料有助于保持催化剂活性和长期稳定性。

3. 酸性位点转换：氢气通过将Brønsted酸性位点转换为Lewis酸性位点来减弱载体的酸性。这种转换降低了载体上的焦炭形成速率。

4. 焦炭特性：虽然氢气压力对金属上焦炭形成速率影响不大，但它显著改变了焦炭中的氢含量。在较高的氢分压下，焦炭变得不那么致密和紧实。

5. 焦炭软化：氢气可以通过氢化作用进一步软化金属上形成的焦炭。

6. 能量障碍：尽管在给定的引用中没有明确提到，但氢气共进料可能会影响各种反应的能量障碍，包括焦炭形成和丙烷脱氢。

7. 石墨化：文本没有直接提到石墨化，但焦炭特性的变化（密度、紧实度）表明氢气共进料可能会影响石墨化程度。

这些影响对整体过程效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 提高催化剂寿命：焦炭形成减少和焦炭特性变软导致催化剂寿命延长，再生周期减少。

2. 增强过程稳定性：焦炭积累减少导致操作更稳定，产品收率更一致。

3. 潜在权衡：虽然氢气共进料抑制焦炭形成，但也可能影响脱氢反应的平衡，潜在降低丙烯收率。

4. 优化工艺条件：需要仔细平衡氢含量、焦炭形成和产品收率，以最大化整体过程效率。

5. 能量考虑：添加氢气可能会影响过程的能量平衡，可能需要调整热管理策略。

总之，PDH过程中的氢气共进料在抑制焦炭和催化剂稳定性方面提供了显著优势，但其实施需要仔细考虑各种工艺参数，以实现最佳性能和效率。
