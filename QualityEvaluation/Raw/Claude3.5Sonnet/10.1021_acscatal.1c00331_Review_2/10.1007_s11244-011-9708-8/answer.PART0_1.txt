[1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "It is noted here that although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact."

[4] "In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation and catalyst stability:

1. Coke suppression: Increasing hydrogen content in the feed greatly reduces overall coke formation. This improves catalyst stability by reducing deactivation due to coking.

2. Acid site conversion: Hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites. This reduces coke formation rate on the support.

3. Coke properties: Higher hydrogen partial pressure results in coke that is less dense and compact, particularly on metal surfaces. The coke formed has a higher hydrogen content and can be further softened through hydrogenation.

4. Metal vs. support effects: Hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal itself, but significantly impacts coke formation on the support.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst lifetime: Reduced coking leads to slower catalyst deactivation, extending the time between regeneration cycles.

2. Enhanced selectivity: Less coke formation may improve selectivity towards desired products.

3. Easier regeneration: Softer, less compact coke is likely easier to remove during catalyst regeneration.

4. Process optimization: The differential effects of hydrogen on metal and support coking allow for potential fine-tuning of reaction conditions to balance desired activity and stability.

5. Energy considerations: While hydrogen addition suppresses coking, it may impact the overall thermodynamics and energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding offers a powerful tool for controlling coke formation and improving catalyst performance in PDH processes, but requires careful optimization to balance its various effects on reaction mechanisms and process efficiency.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性有显著影响：

1. 抑制焦炭形成：增加进料中的氢气含量大大减少了总体焦炭形成。这通过减少因结焦造成的失活来提高催化剂稳定性。

2. 酸性位点转化：氢气通过将布朗斯特酸位点转化为路易斯酸位点来削弱载体的�idity。这减少了载体上的焦炭形成速率。

3. 焦炭性质：较高的氢分压会导致焦炭密度较低且不紧实，特别是在金属表面。形成的焦炭具有更高的氢含量，并可通过加氢进一步软化。

4. 金属与载体效应：氢气压力对金属本身的结焦速率影响较小，但对载体上的焦炭形成影响显著。

这些效应对工艺效率和性能有重要影响：

1. 改善催化剂寿命：减少结焦导致催化剂失活速度变慢，延长再生周期之间的时间。

2. 提高选择性：较少的焦炭形成可能会提高对目标产物的选择性。

3. 更易再生：较软、不紧实的焦炭在催化剂再生过程中可能更容易去除。

4. 过程优化：氢气对金属和载体结焦的差异效应允许潜在地微调反应条件，以平衡所需的活性和稳定性。

5. 能量考虑：虽然添加氢气抑制结焦，但可能影响脱氢过程的整体热力学和能量效率。

总的来说，氢气共进料为控制PDH过程中的焦炭形成和改善催化剂性能提供了强有力的工具，但需要仔细优化以平衡其对反应机理和过程效率的各种影响。
