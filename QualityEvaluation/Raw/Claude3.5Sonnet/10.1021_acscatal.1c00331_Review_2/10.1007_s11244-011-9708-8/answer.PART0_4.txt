[1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "Hydrogen promotes while hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke. These results are in good agreement with the shift of Peak II in Figs. 1 and 2."

[4] "At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact. In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

[5] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation suppression: Increasing hydrogen content in the feed greatly reduces overall coke formation. This effect is more pronounced on the support than on the metal surfaces.

2. Catalyst stability improvement: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst stability, potentially extending the catalyst's lifetime and reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke, particularly on the support. It also weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, further reducing coke formation rates.

4. Coke characteristics: Higher hydrogen partial pressures result in less dense and compact coke. The coke formed on metal surfaces can be softened through hydrogenation, potentially making it easier to remove during regeneration.

5. Energy barriers: While not explicitly mentioned, the inhibition of coke formation and conversion of acid sites suggest that hydrogen cofeeding may lower energy barriers for desired reactions while increasing barriers for coke-forming reactions.

6. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen affects coke formation differently on metal and support surfaces. It has a stronger inhibitory effect on coke formation on the support compared to the metal surfaces.

These effects have several implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity, reducing downtime and regeneration costs.
2. Potential for higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity due to reduced coke-induced deactivation.
3. Possibility of operating at higher temperatures or lower pressures without excessive coking, potentially improving process economics.
4. Need for optimizing hydrogen partial pressure to balance coke suppression with desired PDH reactions.
5. Potential for developing more efficient catalyst designs that leverage the beneficial effects of hydrogen cofeeding.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding appears to be a valuable strategy for improving the efficiency and performance of the PDH process by mitigating coke formation and enhancing catalyst stability.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理产生了显著影响，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 抑制积碳形成：增加进料中的氢气含量可大大减少总体积碳形成。这种效果在载体上比在金属表面上更为明显。

2. 提高催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料增强了催化剂的稳定性，可能延长催化剂的使用寿命并减少再生循环的频率。

3. 反应机理：氢气抑制芳香族积碳的形成，特别是在载体上。它还通过将Brønsted酸性位转化为Lewis酸性位来削弱载体的酸性，进一步降低积碳形成速率。

4. 积碳特性：较高的氢气分压会导致积碳密度和紧实度降低。金属表面上形成的积碳可以通过加氢软化，可能使其在再生过程中更容易去除。

5. 能量障碍：虽然没有明确提及，但积碳形成的抑制和酸性位的转化表明，氢气共进料可能降低了所需反应的能量障碍，同时增加了积碳形成反应的障碍。

6. 积碳累积模式：氢气对金属表面和载体表面的积碳形成影响不同。与金属表面相比，它对载体上积碳形成的抑制作用更强。

这些效果对整体过程效率和性能有几个影响：

1. 改善催化剂寿命，减少停机时间和再生成本。
2. 由于减少了积碳导致的失活，可能提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
3. 可能在更高温度或更低压力下操作而不会过度积碳，可能改善过程经济性。
4. 需要优化氢气分压，平衡积碳抑制和所需的PDH反应。
5. 可能开发出更高效的催化剂设计，利用氢气共进料的有益效果。

总的来说，氢气共进料通过减轻积碳形成和增强催化剂稳定性，似乎是提高PDH过程效率和性能的一种有价值的策略。
