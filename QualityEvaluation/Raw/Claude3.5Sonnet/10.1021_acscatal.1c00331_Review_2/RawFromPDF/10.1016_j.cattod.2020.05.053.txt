Abstract  
 
Side reactions competing with propane dehydrogenation were studied on K-PtSn/Al2O3 
and SnOx/SiO2 catalysts. The results showed that hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, deep 
dehydrogenation, and coke formation occurred more pronouncedly on K-PtSn/Al2O3, 
contrasting with the catalytic cracking result. Because of the higher total acidity on SnOx/SiO2, 
measured by NH3-TPD, more catalytic cracking occurred on this catalyst. However, SnOx/SiO2 
showed a lower coke deposition, although the acid site can promote the coke formation. This

contrast was not due to the spillover effect, which can suppress coke formation on the acid site. 
Essentially, the propylene hydrogenation, H2-TPD, and FTIR results demonstrate that 
SnOx/SiO2 had a lower hydrogen spillover than that of K-PtSn/Al2O3. On the other hand, TPO 
results from propylene dehydrogenation and coke formation of propadiene illustrate that the 
key of distinguished SnOx/SiO2 catalyst stability was owing to a low ability of coke precursor 
generation.

1. Introduction 
 
Propane dehydrogenation is a vital reaction to produce valuable olefin products, 
especially propylene, which is an essential intermediate for many chemical industries. For this 
reaction, the catalyst shows an important role to proceed the reaction, hence the catalytic for 
propane dehydrogenation has been extensively studied in a recent decade. Pt and CrOx-based 
catalysts have been well-known as the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, and it regularly 
uses to be a standard catalyst in a propylene production industry[1]. However, due to the 
toxicity of CrOx-based catalyst and the environmental issue, the Pt is quite more favorable in 
the research and development field. To increase the efficiency of Pt in the catalytic reaction, 
introduction of Pt into support is necessary. Due to the availability and low cost, silica and 
alumina are common supports for catalysts production; nevertheless, there is evidence 
informing that ùõæ-Al2O3 is a proper support for PtSn catalyst comparing with SiO2[2]. Therefore, 
ùõæ-Al2O3 is standard support for Pt-based catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation process for 
many decades. However, at present the UOP group choose Œ∏-Al2O3 support for the industrial 
process[3] because it has lower Bronsted acid sites relative to Œ≥- Al2O3 consequence to less of 
side reaction, while it still gives the excellent of Pt dispersion although it tends to have lower 
surface area than ùõæ-Al2O3[1]. Besides, many researchers have attempt to improve the stability 
of the Pt-based catalyst, which is the leading problem caused by coke formation. In a general 
way, the promoters, as alkali metals like Na, Li, and K, were added to the catalyst to suppress 
the acid sites, which was one cause of coke formation[4-7]. While the addition of other 
promoters such as Cu, Sn, Ga, and In can improve the electronic and geometric effect of Pt-
based catalysts, so coke formation was also reduced[8-13]. Furthermore, there was some 
evidence showing that Sn can also promote the migration of coke precursors to the support of 
the catalyst leading to the decreasing amount of deactivated active sites covering by coke[13, 
14]. Due to the unique effect of Sn and the best performance of K modified on PtSn/Al2O3 
catalyst when comparing with other alkaline metals like Na and Li[15, 16], K-PtSn/Al2O3 is 
the conventional catalyst, which is broadly used in propane dehydrogenation industry.  
However, it is recently found that only tin on silica support can also activate propane 
dehydrogenation not only as a promoter, but it shows outstanding stability for 20 hours with a 
considerable constant conversion when compared with two commercial catalysts, K-
PtSn/Al2O3, and K-Cr/Al2O3[17-19]. Hence, It was interesting to know that what the properties 
on SnOx/SiO2 that consequent to outstanding stability are and how differences in the side 
reaction pathways of this catalyst from the conventional catalyst such as K-PtSn/Al2O3 can be 
elucidated . For the investigation, insight of tin oxide on silica support is necessary. The various 
researches studied involving the catalytic properties of tin oxide on silica, and this catalyst was 
Journal Pre-proof
also applied to many reactions such as Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, sugar 
isomerization and epimerization, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, phenol hydroxylation, Aldol 
condensation, and Mukaiyama reaction[20]. In general, mixed tin oxide-silica is the Lewis acid 
catalyst[20, 21], and its acidity may bring to the activation of propane dehydrogenation. 
Nevertheless, the researchers found that the acidity of catalysts can promote coke formation, 
while Lewis acid tends to rise more coke formation comparing with Bronsted acid[22, 23]. 
Therefore, SnOx/SiO2 probably shows the deactivation during the reaction period. However, 
the above evidence showed that SnOx/SiO2 performs promising stability during the propane 
dehydrogenation; hence, the stability of this catalyst is likely be due to some factors that affect 
the reduction of coke formation on the acid site. Based on this hypothesis, the spillover of 
hydrogen should be brought for consideration. 
Hydrogen spillover is the migration of the hydrogen atom, which is adsorbed or formed 
on one surface to another neighborhood surface[24]. This phenomenon was discovered since 
1964 by Khoobiar, who found that the WO3 can be reduced at room temperature after physical 
mixing with Pt/Al2O3, whereas the physical mixing of WO3 with Al2O3 and the pure WO3 can 
not be reduced. This result was attributed to the migration of hydrogen, which dissociated on 
the Pt surface and spilled to the WO3[25]. Spillover of hydrogen is applied to many fields. For 
example, in hydrogen storage, semiconductor, insulator, and including the catalytic field[24, 
26]. In the field of a heterogeneous catalyst, there was evidence showing that spillover of 
hydrogen can reduce coke formation by the change of Lewis acid, which has a stronger 
influence on coke formation into Bronsted acid[27]. This Lewis acid transformation to 
Bronsted acid attributed to the hydrogen spillover effect was also proven by other 
researchers[28, 29] using the FTIR technique. Moreover, some researchers purpose that 
hydrogen spillover can remove coke precursors across to the hydrogenation with spilled 
hydrogen to make the desorption possible for species like methane[30, 31]. Based on this 
evidence, the good stability of SnOx/SiO2 is likely due to the hydrogen spillover effect. 
In the experiment, K-PtSn/Al2O3 was used to compare with SnOx/SiO2. Hydrogenolysis, 
hydrogenation, and catalytic cracking were the side reactions that we needed to concern 
because hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation result in undesired alkane products, while catalytic 
cracking gives undesired methane and ethylene. Additionally, propylene dehydrogenation was 
selected to represent the deep dehydrogenation, which had an association with the generation 
of coke precursor and coke formation while propadiene was used to study the coke formation 
ability of SnOx/SiO2 catalyst. The spent catalyst was characterized by the TPO technique and 
the amount of coke represented by percent of carbon converting from the amount of CO2 per 1 
gram of catalyst. The acidity of the catalysts, which affected catalytic cracking and coke 
formation was determined by NH3-TPD, while H2-TPD, FTIR, and propylene hydrogenation 
were used to study the hydrogen spillover ability.

2. Experimental 
2.1 Catalysts preparation 
K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by the sequential incipient wetness impregnation 
method. First, ùõæ‚àíalumina oxide support, obtained from calcinated boehmite (Sasol) at 550 oC 
with a heating rate of 3 oC/min for 4 h in box furnace, was impregned with a mixed aqueous 
solution of chloroplatinic acid hydrate and tin (II) chloride dihydrate in ethanol with 0.3 percent 
loading for both Pt and Sn. After dried in room temperature for 2 h, the sample was put into 
the oven with the fixed temperature at 110 ¬∞C overnight. The dried sample was calcined at 
550 ¬∞C with a heating rate of 10 ¬∞C /min for 3 h in the air. Potassium nitrate in deionization 
water solution was secondly impregned into the catalyst with 0.6 percent loading. Finally, the 
wet sample was dried and calcined with the same procedure as the previous steps. 
 
SnOx/SiO2 catalyst with 4 percent loading was prepared by the sol-gel method. Cetyl 
trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and 30% ammonia solution were added into ethanol 
and deionized water mixture. The mixture was stirred for 15 min, then the homogeneous mixed 
solution of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and tin (II) chloride dihydrate in ethanol was added 
dropwise to the former solution while continuous stirring. After mixing for 2 h, the sample was 
filtered and washed with deionized water until the pH of washing water become the same as 
deionized water. The wet catalyst was dried at 110 ¬∞C overnight and then calcined in air at 
550 ¬∞C with a heating rate of 2 ¬∞C /min for 6 h. The physicochemical properties of these two 
catalysts are shown in Table 1.  
2.2 Catalytic reaction 
 
The reaction was tested by using a fixed-bed reactor connected with GC-FID. All of 
the reactions were carried out under atmospheric pressure with 1 g of the catalyst. Before any 
reaction testing, the catalyst was pretreated under the same condition. Firstly, the temperature 
was ramped to 500 ¬∞C in N2 feed with a heating rate of 10 ¬∞C /min, and then the catalyst was 
reduced at 500 ¬∞C  for 55 min using H2 and N2 co-feed with a flow rate of 50:50 ml/min after 
that purged the sample using N2 for 5 min subsequently raised the temperature to 600 and held 
for 30 min prior to starting the reaction.  
For the reaction testing, 99.99% propane and 99.99% propylene with a weight hourly 
space velocity (WSHV) of 0.37 and 0.35 h-1 were respectively used as a feedstock for propane 
and propylene dehydrogenation, while 5% propylene in N2 co-feed with H2 and N2  in a ratio 
of 1:1:2 was used as a feed for propylene hydrogenation. The WSHV for this reaction was 2.39 
h-1. For the reaction temperature, propane and propylene dehydrogenation were conducted at 
600 ¬∞C, while propylene hydrogenation was conducted at 40 ¬∞C. To study the coke formation 
ability, 5% propadiene in nitrogen was used as a feedstock, and the reaction was conducted 
under the same condition with propylene dehydrogenation. 
2.3 Catalyst characterization 
2.3.1 The hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD)  
There were two procedures for H2-TPD. The first procedure was to compare K-
PtSn/Al2O3 and Sn/SiO2. The second one was to find the reversible and non-reversible peak, 
which was related to hydrogen desorption on metal and support, respectively. 
For the first procedure, 0.1 g of catalyst was pretreated with the same procedure as 
reaction testing. After finished the pre-treatment, the sample was cooled down to 40 ¬∞C,  then 
Journal Pre-proof
adsorbed the hydrogen for 30 min subsequent to de-physisorption by nitrogen gas for 1 h after 
that temperature-programmed desorption was started from 40-900 ¬∞C  with a heating rate of 
10 ¬∞C /min and held for 1 h. For the second procedure of H2-TPD, it used the same procedure 
as the reference testing on the Pt [32], in which 0.1 g of a catalyst was reduced at 300 ¬∞C, 
cooled in H2 and condected the temperature program desorption from 40-700 ¬∞C. After that, 
the catalyst was reduced at 700 ¬∞C, cooled down in H2 and subsequently desorbed the second 
temperature program from 40 to 700 ¬∞C. 
 
2.3.2 In situ IR spectroscopy 
The catalyst was pretreated, adsorbed, and de-physisorbed with the same procedure as 
the first procedure of H2-TPD. The data were corrected after finished the pre-treatment process 
at 40 ¬∞C and after finished the de-physisorption at 40 ¬∞C. For the hydrogen desorption process, 
the temperature was raised to 125 ¬∞C, and held around 5 min and subsequently cooled down to 
40 ¬∞C.  At this temperature, the IR result was collected. Finally, the temperature was raised to 
250 ¬∞C, and then it was held and cooled down to 40 ¬∞C and the data was corrected. 
 
2.3.2 The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) 
 
The spent catalyst was packed in a quartz column with 0.1 g catalyst. Then, the sample 
was exposed to 1% oxygen in helium gas using Ô¨Çow rate of 25 ml/min. Finally, the temperature 
program was increased from room temperature up to 800 ¬∞C with a heating rate of 5 ¬∞C /min. 
The CO2 signal was collected using TCD and GC column. 
 
2.3.4 The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) 
 
For this testing, 0.1 g of catalyst was pretreated and cooled down to 40 ¬∞C, and then the 
sample was exposed to 15% NH3 in He gas for 30 min. After that the sample was de-
physisorbed for 1 h. The temperature-programmed desorption was started at 40-800 ¬∞C at a 
ramp rate of 10 ¬∞C/min and held for 1 h. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 
Propane dehydrogenation on K-PtSn/Al2O3 and SnOx/SiO2 catalysts was conducted at 
600 ¬∞C with a weight hourly space velocity (WSHV) of 0.37 h-1 for 5 h using 99.99% propane 
as a feedstock. The result in Figure 1 shows the higher initial conversion at 42.3% for K-
PtSn/Al2O3 compared with SnOx/SiO2 catalysts at 29.9%. However, K-PtSn/Al2O3 shows fast 
deactivation when compared with SnOx/SiO2 catalysts because of coke formation. The 
selectivity comparison showing in Figure 2 illustrates that SnOx/SiO2 has higher propylene 
selectivity than K-PtSn/Al2O3 with the values of 84 and 78% at initial, respectively. Moreover, 
K-PtSn/Al2O3 shows higher undesired alkane selectivity. These alkane products, like methane 
and ethane, can roughly refer to hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation side reactions while 
methane and ethylene can refer to catalytic cracking, which SnOx/SiO2 shows more selective 
on this side reaction than K-PtSn/Al2O3. However, the comparison of our K-PtSn/Al2O3 
catalyst with other researches showing in Table 2 informs that most of the other researches 
show better catalytic testing results than ours, especially the deactivation rate and selectivity. 
This result may be due to the difference in the feed mixture, type of alumina support, and % 
loading of each elemental (Pt, Sn, and K). First, other researchers used co-feed propylene and 
hydrogen, while ours used pure propylene feed. There was evident showing that using co-
feeding hydrogen can reduce coke precursors coverage on the catalyst surface. It also decreases 
Journal Pre-proof
the adsorption strength of the propylene product; hence propylene products can desorb easily. 
Moreover, it can increase energy barriers for the further dehydrogenation of propylene, 
resulting in a decrease of deep dehydrogenation[33]. Therefore, using co-feed hydrogen ought 
to show better activity and stability than using pure feed propane. Secondly, the different types 
of alumina support directly affect to selectivity and coke formation because Œ∏-Al2O3 has less 
Bronsted acid than ùõæ-Al2O3[1]; howbeit, due to the temperature limit of our equipment, we 
were unable to synthesize Œ∏-Al2O3 support because it was necessary to calcinate at a very high 
temperature ( >900 oC)[3, 4]. Hence, ùõæ-Al2O3 was chosen to be a support for our K-PtSn/Al2O3 
catalyst instead of Œ∏-Al2O3. Finally, the percent of metals loading on our catalyst measured by 
the XRF technique was 0.9, 0.4, and 0.2% for K, Pt, and Sn, respectively. This percent loading 
might not be suitable. However, the catalytic testing result of our K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst could 
be comparable with the result of Li et al., in which they used the same support ( ùõæ-Al2O3) with 
this work[5]. For our research, we emphasize the key of stability in SnOx/SiO2 catalyst 
corresponding to the results reported by Wang et al.  They found that this catalyst has more 
stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3[17].  This result was consistent with our experiment although our 
K-PtSn/Al2O3 showed much faster deactivation. The comparison trend between K-PtSn/Al2O3 
and SnOx/SiO2 can be comparable. 
According to the selectivity result of SnOx/SiO2, this catalyst tended to undergo the 
catalytic cracking side reaction when compared with K-PtSn/Al2O3. The active site for catalytic 
cracking was reported to be an acid site [1, 34]. Although silica has a lower acidity than alumina 
support [35, 36], the addition of Sn into silica can increase the surface hydroxyl and silanol 
groups [37], indicating an increase in the acid site. Figure 3 shows the comparison of the 
ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) results between K-PtSn/Al2O3 and 
SnOx/SiO2. The total acidity of SnOx/SiO2 is higher than the K-PtSn/Al2O3 corresponding to 
higher activity in catalytic cracking. As known, many researches showed that the acidity could 
promote coke formation [4, 22, 23] resulting in the deactivation. However, SnOx/SiO2 still had 
better stability when compared with K-PtSn/Al2O3 due to lower coke deposition. This result 
may involve the strength of acidity. Some researches indicated that the preferable coke 
formation was increased with the acid strength [22], and the hydrogen spillover effect can 
reduce coke formation on the acid site [27]. The NH3-TPD result also indicated the strength of 
acidity on the catalyst surface. The peak position at 100, 250, and 400 ¬∞C  can refer to the weak, 
medium, and strong acid sites, respectively [38, 39]. SnOx/SiO2 shows a large amount of 
medium acid site, while K-PtSn/Al2O3 shows much of the weak and strong acid. The higher 
amount of strong acid on the K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst maybe one reason that convinces the faster 
deactivation on K-PtSn/Al2O3 comparing with SnOx/SiO2. However, the amount of total acid 
on SnOx/SiO2 is still higher than K-PtSn/Al2O3, so the hydrogen spillover effect was brought 
to consider. 
The hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) results compared 
between SnOx/SiO2 and K-PtSn/Al2O3 are displayed in Figure 4. There are two peaks around 
350 and 750 oC for K-PtSn/Al2O3, while it has four peaks occurred at 125, 200, 500, and 800 
oC for Sn/SiO2. From the reference [32], peak at 350 oC of K-PtSn/Al2O3 was referred to the 
hydrogen spillover on support, while the peak at 750 ¬∞C occurred from the decomposition of a 
catalyst. The low-temperature peak of hydrogen desorption on a metal site at 175 ¬∞C did not 
appear owing to a small amount of Pt loading. However, the peak criterion may differ for the 
non-Pt-base catalyst. For example, Ru-based catalysts had a peak of hydrogen adsorbed on a 
metal site at around 30-500 ¬∞C [40], while the temperature around 120-140 ¬∞C  was 
corresponding to the desorption of hydrogen bonding to the metal site on TiO2 [41]. For SnO2, 
there were some studies about hydrogen desorption by Raman spectroscopy. They proposed 
Journal Pre-proof
that the peak on the temperature range of 180 to 550 ¬∞C  exhibited the desorption of hydrogen-
bonded on the active sites provided by SnO2 nanoparticles and multi-wall carbon nanotube, 
while the temperature range of 170‚àí210 ¬∞C corresponded to the desorption of hydrogen from 
the hydrogenated single-wall carbon nanotube‚àíSnO2 composite sample [42, 43]. Unfortunately, 
there was no study about H2-TPD in SnOx/SiO2 catalyst; hence it is necessary to specify any 
peaks of Sn/SiO2, which appear on H2-TPD result in Figure 4. For the specification process, 
the sample was tested using H2-TPD with the same procedure, which was tested on the Pt in 
the reference [32]. In addition, the in-situ IR spectroscopy was also used to confirm the testing 
result.  
Figure 5 shows H2-TPD results. The black line(A) is a reduction of SnOx/SiO2 at 
300 ¬∞C, while red line(B) refers to the re-reduction of SnOx/SiO2 at 700 ¬∞C. The first TPD (red 
line) shows two peaks at 125 and 250 ¬∞C. In a term of secondary TPD, the first peak disappears, 
while the later peaks around 200-500 ¬∞C still occur. This result indicates that the peak around 
200 to 500 ¬∞C   may occur from the desorption of hydrogen on tin oxide active sites, while an 
irreversible peak at 125 oC is likely due to the desorption of water. The broaderness of a later 
peak may be due to the slower desorption of hydrogen when compared to the first TPD. This 
suggests that the increase of hydrogen adsorption amount on a catalyst surface is due to the 
raising of the unsaturated tin oxide active sites amount from secondary reduction. 
In situ IR spectroscopy was used to support the H2-TPD result. Figure 6 demonstrates 
the IR results at the temperature of 40 ¬∞C obtained after the pre-treatment process (line A), 
hydrogen adsorption, and physisorption at 40 ¬∞C (line B) and hydrogen desorption at 125 and 
250 ¬∞C (line C and D), respectively. The peak at 3740 cm-1 refers to the isolated silanol group 
[44], while the changing in the intensity of the shoulder peak around 3600 cm-1 and two peaks 
around 3200 and 3060 cm-1 can be attributed to the changing in the total of a surface hydroxyl 
group [37, 45, 46] which was due to the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen from any 
surface of the catalyst consisting of metal and the support surface. However, because we are 
interested in hydrogen spillover on a silica support, the only peak at 3740 cm-1 was considered. 
The barely changing from A to D steps of that peak can indicate that only a few hydrogens can 
spill to a silica surface; therefore, it is possible that hydrogen spillover was hardly occurred on 
SnOx/SiO2. Moreover, the peak at 1610 cm-1, which represents the adsorbed water [37, 47] 
shows the decreasing of intensity at line C when compared to line B. This result indicates that 
there was the desorption of water during hydrogen desorption at 125 ¬∞C. 
From both of H2-TPD result in Figure 5, and the FTIR results in Figure 6, we can 
explain the result of SnOx/SiO2 in Figure 4 that the first peak of H2-TPD at 125 ¬∞C was the 
desorption of water. The second peak around 200 to 500 ¬∞C represents the hydrogen desorption 
from tin oxide, while the peak of hydrogen spillover does not appear due to there was a slight 
amount of hydrogen spillover occurring on the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst. Therefore, it is clear that 
K-PtSn/Al2O3 had more hydrogen spillover than SnOx/SiO2.  This conclusion corresponding to 
the catalytic hydrogenation testing result showing in Figure 7. Because this reaction can be 
promoted by hydrogen spillover [48], it is reasonable that K-PtSn/Al2O3 exbibits a better 
hydrogenation activity than SnOx/SiO2, which does not activate this reaction at the same 
conditions. Additionally, the reason that leads to the lack of hydrogen spillover in the 
SnOx/SiO2 catalyst, although tin oxide can dissolve the hydrogen molecule [43, 49], was a poor 
hydrogen receptivity of silica support[50]. However, due to the lack of hydrogen spillover, the 
cause of outstanding stability in the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst should not involve the effect of 
hydrogen spillover. Hence, the ability of coke precursor generation and the ability of coke 
formation on the catalysts were taken to consider.  
Journal Pre-proof
Figure 8 demonstrates the comparative result of propylene conversion in propylene 
dehydrogenation. The result shows that K-PtSn/Al2O3 has a higher propylene conversion than 
SnOx/SiO2, hence it can approximate that there was a higher degree of deep dehydrogenation 
occurring on K-PtSn/Al2O3. The TPO results of the spent catalyst from this reaction were 
shown as a solid line in Figure 9. K-PtSn/Al2O3 has two peaks around 450 and 525 ¬∞C, while 
SnOx/SiO2 has only one peak around 550 ¬∞C. The TPO low-temperature peak around 400 to 
450 ¬∞C in K-PtSn/Al2O3 result indicated the coke occurring on a metal site. This result was the 
major cause of the deactivation in the K-PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, while high-temperature peak 
around 550 to 600 ¬∞C, which appears on both K-PtSn/Al2O3 and SnOx/SiO2‚Äôs TPO results, 
indicates the coke occurring on support [51, 52]. This result informs that the coke on the 
SnOx/SiO2 catalyst prefers to deposit on support contrasting with K-PtSn/Al2O3; therefore, this 
catalyst could express better stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3. In addition, the TPO result of 
SnOx/SiO2 shows obvious lower coke content than K-PtSn/Al2O3, for its reason. It was possible 
to explain in two points. First, the coke precursor generation on SnOx/SiO2 was less than that 
on K-PtSn/Al2O3 or second, SnOx/SiO2 has poor ability to adsorb coke precursor; hence the 
coke formation was limited. The actual reason was investigated by the testing of propadiene‚Äôs 
coke formation using SnOx/SiO2 as a catalyst. Then, the spent catalyst from this testing was 
brought to characterize using the TPO technique. This TPO result shows as a dashed line in 
Figure 9, indicating the higher intensity of this sample compared with SnOx/SiO2 spent catalyst 
obtained from propylene dehydrogenation. This informs that the cause of low coke deposit on 
SnOx/SiO2 was not affected by the difficult of coke precursor adsorption on SnOx/SiO2. Hence, 
the excellent stability of SnOx/SiO2 was due to its poor ability in coke precursor generation.  
The consideration of the atomic radius between Pt, Sn, and O showed that the radius 
distance order was O < Pt < Sn [53]. If each atom is bonded with C atom from the hydrocarbon 
molecule, the bonding of O-C will be the strongest. The Pt-C should have a stronger bond than 
Sn-C. The strength of bonding directly influences the desorption of the hydrocarbon molecule, 
so the desorption of the hydrocarbon molecule from O atom in the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst must be 
the hardest. However, it contrasts with the experimental result, which showed that K-
PtSn/Al2O3 had higher deep dehydrogenation than SnOx/SiO2. The electronegativity 
comparison showed that O atom in SnOx/SiO2 catalyst had more probability to bond with H 
atom, which was dissociated from hydrocarbon molecule, than C atom because the difference 
of electronegativity of O atom compared with H atom that had more than O atom compared 
with C atom [53]. Similarly to Sn, it had more differences in electronegativity between Sn and 
C atom than Sn and O atom [53], so Sn perhaps prefer to bond with C atom than H atom. This 
result was similar to the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation that occurred on Sn-
containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), which was proposed by Wang et al. [18]. This 
mechanism was consistent with our experimental result due to Sn had a higher atomic radius 
than Pt. Hence, SnOx/SiO2 had a weaker bonding with hydrocarbon molecule when compared 
with K-PtSn/Al2O3.  This results in the easier desorption of hydrocarbon and the less probability 
to undergo further dehydrogenation on SnOx/SiO2 catalyst when compared with K-PtSn/Al2O3. 
Besides, the lower coke precursor generation on SnOx/SiO2 can be explained by its structure 
since the active species on SnOx/SiO2 catalyst is metal oxide, while K-PtSn/Al2O3 is a metal. 
There was a research explaining that the active species of metal coordinately unsaturated in a 
metal oxide was separated and spread homogeneously over catalyst surface. Thus, oxygen 
atoms partitioned each active species of a metal oxide catalyst. This partition causes the 
problem on the migration of the adsorbed hydrocarbons over catalyst surface, while the metal 
did not have this problem due to the closing of its active sites[1]. Moreover, the coke formation 
on Pt metal which occurred through a deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway was 
also proposed in the literature[1]. From the consideration of this coke formation mechanism,

we found that the large distance between each of Sn active species and the smaller size of C 
atom when compared with Sn[53] may be the cause of difficulties in coke precursor generation. 
For a more clear view, Scheme 1A (upper) is constructed to illustrate the coke intermediate 
of deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway. This picture reveals that it is necessary to 
adsorb the secondary and tertiary carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon molecule on the nearby Pt 
active center. For, SnOx/SiO2 in Scheme 1A (lower), it shows the challenging for the bonding 
of secondary and tertiary carbon atoms because there was a long-distance between each of 
active sites. Therefore, the coke precursor of deep dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway 
was more difficult to be generated on SnOx/SiO2 than K-PtSn/Al2O3. These explanations can 
support our experimental results, which express that the SnOx/SiO2 catalyst had a lack of coke 
precursor generation. However, Scheme 1B illustrates that the coke formation on SnOx/SiO2 
was possible to occur through the catalytic cracking pathway. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The comparative study of SnOx/SiO2 and K-PtSn/Al2O3 in propane dehydrogenation 
shows that K-PtSn/Al2O3 had higher catalytic activity than SnOx/SiO2. At the same time, the 
side reaction comparison of each catalyst informed that K-PtSn/Al2O3 preferred to selective 
hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, while SnOx/SiO2 preferred to selective catalytic cracking 
because SnOx/SiO2 had higher total acidity than K-PtSn/Al2O3. Although the acidity directly 
influenced to coke formation, SnOx/SiO2 still had a lower coke formation than K-PtSn/Al2O3. 
Moreover, most of the coke occurring on SnOx/SiO2 deposited at the support, whereas the coke 
occurring on K-PtSn/Al2O3 could deposit at both metal and support. Therefore, SnOx/SiO2 had 
much better stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3. The H2-TPD and FTIR results show that the lower 
coke formation on SnOx/SiO2 was not a result of hydrogen spillover effect [27, 30, 31] due to 
the poor ability to receive hydrogen of its silica support. However, the additional experiments 
indicated the actual reason for SnOx/SiO2  to exhibit better stability than K-PtSn/Al2O3 
according to the less of coke precursor generation on this catalyst. This result can be  explained 
using the atomic radius and electronegativity. The electronegativity comparison informs that C 
atom perhaps prefer to bond with Sn atom than O atom. Because Sn has a larger atomic radius 
than Pt, the bonding of hydrocarbon molecule with Sn active sites was weaker than Pt active 
sites. It leads to a lower ability on deep dehydrogenation. Additionally, the wide distance of Sn 
active species due to the partition of a neighboring oxygen atom and the smaller of carbon 
atomic size compared with Sn atom causes to the difficulty in the secondary and tertiary carbon 
atom adsorption on the next Sn2+ active site. This was an important step in deep 
dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway. Hence, the coke formation from deep 
dehydrogenation and dimerization pathway had low probability, while the coke formation from 
the catalytic cracking pathway had a higher possibility. However, these were roughly 
explanations because there were many factors that influence the strength of bonding, which 
was not considered, such as the effect of positive charge in Sn2+ or Sn4+.  This could affect the 
decrease of its atomic radius, the hybrid orbitals, and the lone pairs of electrons. To find the 
exact possible mechanism of coke formation, advanced computational techniques such as DFT 
will be necessary to apply.
