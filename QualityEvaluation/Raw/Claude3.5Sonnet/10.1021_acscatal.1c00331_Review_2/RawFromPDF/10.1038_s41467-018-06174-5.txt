Due to the complexity of heterogeneous catalysts, identiﬁcation of active sites and the ways
for their experimental design are not inherently straightforward but important for tailored
catalyst preparation. The present study reveals the active sites for efﬁcient C–H bond acti-
vation in C1–C4 alkanes over ZrO2 free of any metals or metal oxides usually catalysing this
reaction. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that two Zr cations located at an oxygen
vacancy are responsible for the homolytic C–H bond dissociation. This pathway differs from
that reported for other metal oxides used for alkane activation, where metal cation and
neighbouring lattice oxygen form the active site. The concentration of anion vacancies in
ZrO2 can be controlled through adjusting the crystallite size. Accordingly designed ZrO2
shows industrially relevant activity and durability in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation
and performs superior to state-of-the-art catalysts possessing Pt, CrOx, GaOx or VOx species.

T
he ability of scientists to elaborate and apply fundamental
principles for rational design of heterogeneous catalysts is
decisive for the global sustainable development and the
environment protection applications. One possible way in this
direction is to identify the active sites or key atomic structures1,2
and, for the most part, to use this knowledge for catalyst design
and preparation. For example, owing to the well-deﬁned structure
(size and/or shape) and composition of nanoparticles of metals or
metal oxides, they are successfully used for the development of
supported catalysts with controlled properties3–8. Modifying
structure of bulk metal oxides at a nanoscale level also has
striking effects on their physico-chemical and catalytic proper-
ties9–13. The present study elucidates at molecular level the effects
of nanostructure of bare ZrO2 on the activity and selectivity in the
non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane or iso-butane
to the corresponding oleﬁns.
In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which
provide a major part of C2–C4 oleﬁns for the chemical industry,
ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-
butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they
are based on natural/shale gas containing signiﬁcantly less
impurities than the oil-based feedstock. In addition, the dehy-
drogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the
gap between the demand and supply of propene14,15. This oleﬁn is
second to ethene as an important building block of the chemical
industry with an annual production of about 80 million metric
tons15. Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene
production will grow because new plants are under construction16.
There are, however, ﬂaws related to the commercial catalysts with
supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occu-
pational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure
to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-
based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering
of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by
ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15. Recently,
we developed eco-friendly and cost-efﬁcient catalysts on the basis
of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides
and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in
the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or
iso-butane18–20.
Coordinatively
unsaturated
Zr
(Zrcus)
and
neighbouring lattice oxygen were suggested to participate in the
dehydrogenation reaction. Yet, the promoter used to purposefully
create Zrcus sites either increased or decreased the activity hence
proving the limitations of this classical approach for tailored
catalyst design.
Here, we describe how nanostructuring of ZrO2 crystallites
enables the identiﬁcation of the nature of active sites for efﬁ-
cient C–H bond activation and the control of their concentra-
tion without the usage of any dopant or supported species.
Acid–base, redox and electrical conductivity properties of ZrO2
can also be controlled through crystallite size. A structural
model of the active site is established owing to our multi-
disciplinary approach combining density functional theory
(DFT) calculations with a number of complementary experi-
mental methods including catalytic tests. The active site con-
sists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which
homolytically break the C–H bond in alkanes. The kind of this
site differs from that previously suggested by some of us for
doped ZrO2-based catalysts18,19 and by other researchers for
different metal oxides used for PDH21–23, where metal cation
and neighbouring lattice oxygen were assumed to form the
active site. Bare ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the
concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant
performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts
containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of-
the-art catalysts.
Results
Controlling activity and selectivity of ZrO2. The scientiﬁc
background for our study was the fact that the relative ratio of
coordinatively unsaturated sites on the surface of metal oxides to
their regular counterparts depends on the size of crystallites24. To
check the inﬂuence of the nanostructure of bare ZrO2 for C–H
bond activation in lower alkanes, we synthesized about 40 ZrO2
samples (Supplementary Table 1). Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis proved that they are mainly composed of the
monoclinic phase (Supplementary Fig. 1) but differed in the
average size of crystallites determined from the (
111) and (111)
XRD reﬂexes. As seen in Fig. 1a, the rate of propene formation in
PDH decreased by a factor of up to 70 with an increase in the size
from 7 to 45 nm. There were no such strong differences between
the catalysts in terms of the rate of propene formation if non-
catalytic propane dehydrogenation played a signiﬁcant role. The
latter process is actually not relevant under the reaction condi-
tions applied as proven by separate tests19 without catalysts.
It is also worth mentioning that for ZrO2 samples calcined at
temperatures below 550 °C, the size of crystallites was determined
after performing the PDH reaction (Supplementary Table 2). In
addition to the crystallite size, long-range order of lattice oxygen
and zirconium cations within at least a few nanometres in the
crystal lattice of ZrO2 should be relevant for achieving high PDH
activity. This conclusion is based on the fact that XRD-
amorphous ZrO2 showed very low activity (Fig. 1a). The obtained
relationship between the rate of propene formation and the size of
crystallites is also valid when the rate is calculated with respect to
catalyst surface area (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Thus, a simple
effect of the crystallite size on the surface area and accordingly on
the activity can be excluded, as the rate related to catalyst surface
area increases with the area (Supplementary Fig. 2b-c).
No effect of the area would be visible if this catalyst property
determined the activity exclusively. Moreover, although amor-
phous ZrO2 samples (ZrO2_24 and ZrO2_26 in Supplementary
Table 1) possess the highest surface area, they showed the lowest
activity. The PDH activity of ZrO2 is governed by the number of
the active sites, which depends on the size of crystallites. A further
experimental support for the importance of the latter catalyst
property for PDH is the fact that apparent activation energy of
propene formation depends on the size. The energy increases
from about 140 to 300 kJ mol−1 with an increase in the size from
9 to 43 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3). This effect is related to the
kind of catalytically active sites as will be demonstrated below
when taking further catalytic and characterization studies as well
as DFT calculations into account.
The activity-size relationship in Fig. 1a can be explained by an
increase in the concentration of the catalytically active Zrcus sites
with a decrease in crystallite size. To validate the importance of
such sites for propene formation, catalytic tests were performed
with ZrO2 treated with either H2 or CO at 550 °C before testing in
PDH at the same temperature. The idea was to create additional
Zrcus sites through removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 in form
of H2O or CO2. The rate of propene formation increased by a
factor of 2 after 6 h on H2 stream in comparison with the non-
treated sample (Fig. 1c).
When CO was used as a reducing agent, a seven-time increase
in the rate of propene formation was achieved after only 30 min
treatment. Such distinctive effects of the reducing agents on the
increase in the rate are related to their ability to remove lattice
oxygen from ZrO2 as proven by temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) tests with H2 or CO (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Our DFT calculations also predict that oxygen vacancies are
easier formed through removal of lattice oxygen by CO than by
H2 (Supplementary Table 3). The relevance of the so-generated
surface defects for propene formation is further supported by the

higher ratio of the yield of propene (Y(C3H6)) to that of cracking
products (Y(C1–C2)) in a broad range of propane conversion
obtained over the CO-treated catalyst in comparison to its H2-
treated counterpart (Fig. 1d). This result suggests that propene
and cracking products are formed on different sites.
The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneﬁcial
for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the
crystallite size (Fig. 1b). Such positive effect holds over a broad
range of propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 6). An insight
into the formation and the kind of carbon deposits, which are the
main undesired reaction product, was derived from the operando
UV-vis analysis upon PDH over three ZrO2 samples with 9.1,
13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites. The obtained UV-vis spectra
expressed as the relative Kubelka–Munk function (F(Rrel) in Eq.
(2)) after different times on propane stream are shown in
Fig. 2a–c. F(Rrel) increased across the entire range of the UV-vis
spectrum with rising time on propane stream. This increase must
have occurred due to the deposition of coke species because the
UV-vis spectra of H2-treated catalysts differ strongly (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). Absorption bands with the maxima at about 300,
420, 600 and 750 nm can be tentatively identiﬁed in the spectra of
ZrO2 under PDH conditions. The latter two signals can be
ascribed to polyaromatic graphitic species as previously suggested
for PDH over a Cr-containing catalyst25. Temporal changes of the
intensity of these bands under PDH conditions follow the same
trend thus suggesting that they belong to the same carbon-
containing species (Fig. 2d–f). The bands with the maxima in UV
range (at 300 and 420 nm) should originate from low-condensed
aromatic species, which differ from polyaromatic graphitic
species also absorbing light above 500 nm. Different carbon-
containing species are formed with different rates as seen in
Fig. 2d–f showing temporal changes in the intensity of the
corresponding bands with rising time of propane stream. When
analysing the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 2a–c, it becomes obvious that
the relative ratio of the intensity of absorption bands at 300 and
420 nm to that of the bands at higher wavelengths depends on the
size of ZrO2 crystallites. The larger the size, the higher the
fraction of polyaromatic graphitic species (absorption bands
above 500 nm) is expected. In addition, there is an induction
period before the UV-vis spectra start to change under the PDH
conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8). Such delay may indicate that
some coke precursors (seeds) must be initially formed before coke
formation can proceed. Importantly, the duration of this
induction period increased with a decrease in the size of ZrO2
crystallites (Supplementary Fig. 8).
On the basis of the above discussion, the effect of the size of
ZrO2 crystallites on coke formation can be explained as follows.

interact with each other to initially form small aromatic structures
followed by further oligomerization and condensation to large
graphitic structures15. It is reasonable to suggest that propene
molecules adsorbed horizontally to catalyst surface can recom-
bine owing to their spatial location. Such adsorption should be
more favourable for Zr sites located on ﬂat ZrO2 surfaces in
comparison to those located on corners or edges. Upon increasing
the size of crystallites, the fraction of the former species will
decrease and thus will result in a higher rate of carbon deposition.
Exactly this trend was observed experimentally. Further experi-
mental and theoretical studies are, however, required to clarify
the size effect on coke formation.
We turn our discussion back to catalyst activity to answer two
important questions. Can ZrO2 activate C–H bond in other
alkanes? Is the size–activity relationship valid for PDH only? To
this end, we performed catalytic tests with iso-butane, ethane and
methane with the latter possessing the highest C–H bond strength
among alkanes. Due to the thermodynamic constrains, methane
activation was investigated at 800 °C, while the tests with other
alkanes were carried out at 550 °C, where PDH was also
performed. Ethylene was the only product observed in the tests
with methane. It is, however, worth mentioning that due to the
low CH4 conversion of only 0.015%, it was difﬁcult to precisely
conclude if other products were also formed. Therefore, we do
not discuss product selectivity in CH4 conversion tests. On the
basis of previous studies on the oxidative coupling of methane26
and non-oxidative methane conversion to ethylene27, CH3 radical
is suggested to be formed through breaking the C–H bond in
CH4. Two such radicals recombine to C2H6 followed by its
dehydrogenation to C2H4. ZrO2 is actually able to catalyse the
latter reaction (Fig. 3a).
As seen in Fig. 3a, the feed alkanes can be ordered in terms of
the rate of oleﬁn formation as follows CH4 < C2H6 < C3H8 < iso-
C4H10. This activity order actually correlates with the strength of
the C–H bond in these alkanes. The corresponding values of the
weakest C–H bond in these alkanes are 439.3, 420.5, 410.5 and
400.4 kJ mol−1. Regardless of the size of ZrO2 crystallites, the
activity order did not change, while the dehydrogenation rate of
C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 increased with a decrease in the size
(Fig. 3b). CH4 conversion tests with ZrO2 materials differing in
the size of their crystallites were not performed because this
alkane requires too high temperature, where different structural
changes in ZrO2 will occur.
Benchmarking and demonstrating catalyst durability. To
demonstrate the potential of ZrO2 for PDH from an applied
viewpoint, we determined the space time yield of propene (STY
(C3H6)) over the best performing catalyst from Fig. 1b at different
temperatures and propane conversion above 25%. The selectivity
to propene was above 85%. Carbon deposits were the main side
product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not
desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall
costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat
released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration
phase for the endothermic PDH reaction14. Figure 4a shows a

comparison of the present STY(C3H6) values with those obtained
over state-of-the-art catalysts28-42 (Supplementary Table 4). All
traditional catalysts with supported species of different metal
oxides including chromium are less active than ZrO2. The latter
also showed higher activity in comparison with doped ZrO2-
based catalysts possessing supported Ru. Even in comparison
with highly active but expensive Pt-based catalysts, ZrO2 proved
its outstanding PDH activity.
Further practical relevance of ZrO2 was demonstrated over
about 13 days on stream in a series of 70 PDH/regeneration cycles
at 550, 600 and 625 °C. No reductive treatment was performed
before PDH cycles because the catalyst can generate Zrcus sites
in situ through removal of lattice oxygen by propane/propene.
The yield of propene within one PDH cycle initially increased and
then decreased with rising time on stream at 550 °C but
continuously decreased at higher temperatures (Supplementary
Fig. 9). The increase is related to the formation of Zrcus sites,
while the decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by
formation of carbon deposits, which could be removed upon
oxidative catalyst regeneration as proven by stable catalyst
performance within ﬁrst 20 cycles at 550 °C (Fig. 4b).
When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst
was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of
catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites
caused by temperature-induced sintering process (Supplementary
Fig. 10). Owing to small changes in the size, the catalyst was still
active and durable at 550 °C (last 10 cycles in Fig. 4b) after the
preceding PDH tests at 600 and 625 °C. Propene selectivity was
about 90% (Supplementary Fig. 11).

samples with crystallites of 9.1 or 43.4 nm and one amorphous
sample. Further representative images are given in Supplementary
Fig. 12. There are signiﬁcant differences between the samples in
the structure of the surface depending on the crystallite size.
Zigzag edges were seen in some images of the sample with 9.1 nm
crystallites (Fig. 5a) and indicate the presence of a large number
of corner atoms. Such surface defects should be coordinatively
unsaturated zirconium and/or oxygen ions. They were not
observed in the sample with 43.4 nm crystallites. Nearly perfect
lattice planes with no corner atoms are typical for this sample
(Fig. 5b), while no lattice planes are visible for the XRD-
amorphous sample (Fig. 5c).
The HAADF-STEM technique can provide only limited
quantitative information about the concentration and distribution
of defect sites. In this regard, we applied surface-sensitive
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of probe molecules
differing in their Lewis basicity strength. For minimizing the
effect of Brønsted sites on adsorption/desorption properties of
ZrO220, all TPD tests were carried out with the samples treated at
550 °C to remove acidic OH groups before adsorbing probe
molecules.
CO naturally adsorbing on the Zrcus sites (Lewis acidic sites)
desorbed between 250 and 450 °C (Supplementary Fig. 13). The
surface-normalized concentration of sites for CO adsorption was
established to increase with a decrease in the size of crystallites
(Fig. 5d), while the temperature of maximal rate of CO
desorption was not affected (Supplementary Fig. 13). The lowest
amount was detected for amorphous ZrO2. A similar effect of the
crystallite size on the concentration of adsorption sites for NH3
and C3H6 was also obtained when these compounds were used as
probe molecules for titrating Lewis acidic sites (Supplementary
Fig. 14). Regardless of the probe molecule the rate of alkene
formation from C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 rose with an increase
in the concentration of the accordingly determined Lewis acidic
sites (Supplementary Fig. 15). Thus, the TPD results suggest that
nanostructure is vital for the stabilization/formation of surface
Lewis acidic defects.
We also applied electrical conductivity tests at 550 °C for semi-
quantitative analysis of the number of bulk anion vacancies,
which are responsible for oxygen-ionic conductivity in ZrO2-
based materials43 and direct indicators for the presence of Zrcus
sites. To check the contribution of electronic conduction, we
analysed the effect of oxygen partial pressure on overall
conductivity. Regardless of the size of crystallites, the conductivity
decreased by only a factor of less than 2, which is lower than 21 as
expected for a pure p-conductor upon reducing the pressure from
20 kPa to about 10−4 kPa (Supplementary Table 5). This result
proves that all tested ZrO2 samples mainly possess ionic
conductivity. As seen in Fig. 5e the conductivity increased with
a decrease in the size of crystallites. Such relationship is due to the
higher concentration of anion vacancies or/and higher diffusivity
of O2−in the samples with smaller crystallite size. It is worth
mentioning that the conductivity of amorphous ZrO2 was very
low (Fig. 5e). Thus, an optimal size of ZrO2 crystallites is required
to achieve the highest conductivity.
The crystallite size is also decisive for the formation of anion
vacancies as proven by TPR tests with CO (Fig. 5f). The smaller
the size, the higher the amount of lattice oxygen was removed in

form of CO2. This result is in agreement with previous DFT
calculations predicting that the energy for the formation of an
oxygen vacancy in ZrO2 lowers for nanoscale particles44.
However, amorphous ZrO2 produced very low amount of CO2
from CO (Fig. 5f). Thus, there should be a minimal size of
crystallites, below which the removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2
will be hindered.
Molecular level details on C3H8 dehydrogenation over ZrO2.
With the purpose to derive molecular insights into the kind of the
catalytically active sites for propane dehydrogenation to propene
over monoclinic ZrO2, we performed DFT calculations. The focus
was put on the role of Zrcus sites. As the (
111) facet represents the
most stable surface plane of monoclinic ZrO245–47, it was used as
the basis for computing stoichiometric (s-ZrO2(
111)) and
oxygen-defective (d-ZrO2(
111)) surfaces. Computational details
are given in Supplementary Fig. 16, Supplementary Table 3 and
Supplementary Table 6. Although the energies for activating
C3H8 at the methylene or methyl C–H bond to yield iso-C3H7 or
n-C3H7 are close (Supplementary Table 7), subtraction of a sec-
ond hydrogen to yield propene is kinetically more favourable for
the iso-C3H7 fragment. This result is in agreement with previous
DFT calculations of PDH over other metal oxides21–23. Therefore,
the ﬁrst step of propane activation in our calculations was clea-
vage of the methylene C–H bond. The full potential energy sur-
faces of the most preferred routes on both surfaces are shown in
Fig. 6, while the Gibbs free energy proﬁles are given in
Supplementary Fig. 17. This ﬁgure shows that the apparent free
energy barrier for propane dehydrogenation over the d- ZrO2
(
111) facet is 1.66 eV lower than that over the s-ZrO2(
111) facet
(2.52 vs. 4.18 eV) thus indicating that the dehydrogenation
reaction is kinetically more favoured over the d-ZrO2(
111) facet
than over the s-ZrO2(
111) facet.
Methylene C–H bond activation in propane: To identify the
active sites and the modes of methylene C–H bond dissociation
on the s-ZrO2(
111) surface, we computed this route on a centre
consisting either of one Zr site and one O site or two O sites. For
the sake of completeness, six- and seven-fold coordinated Zr
cations (Zr6cI, Zr7cII, Zr6cIII and Zr6cIV) as well as twofold and
threefold coordinated oxygen anions (O2c, O3cI, O3cII, O3cIII and
O3cIV) were considered (Supplementary Fig. 16). A Zr–O pair was
found to be the most favourable centre to break the methylene
C–H bond through a heterolytic route (Supplementary Fig. 18
and Supplementary Table 7). The Zr6cI–O2c site should possess
the highest reactivity because of the formation of the most stable
Zr6cI–iso-C3H7 and O2c–H intermediates owing to the stronger
basicity of O2c in comparison with O3c. This step is endothermic
by 0.94 eV and has an activation barrier of 1.25 eV (Fig. 6).
In contrast to s-ZrO2(
111), methylene C–H bond cleavage over
d-ZrO2(
111) is a homolytic process without involving lattice
oxygen. This reaction should occur on two adjacent Zr cations, i.
e. Zr5cI and Zr6cII ([Zr5cI, Zr6cII]–Ov) or Zr5cI and Zr6cIII ([Zr5cI,
Zr6cIII]–Ov), and is exothermic by 1.04 or 0.55 eV (Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Table 8). The Zr5cI and Zr6cII cations are located
at an anion vacancy (Ov), while Zr6cIII is a regular surface site.

The formed iso-C3H7 fragment is bound to the Zr5cI site, while
the H atom is located in a bridged position between Zr5cI and
Zr6cII or between Zr5cI and Zr6cIII. On the basis of the activation
barrier (0.16 vs. 0.73 eV) for breaking the methylene C–H bond
(Supplementary Fig. 19), the [Zr5cI, Zr6cII]–Ov site should be
more reactive than the [Zr5cI, Zr6cIII]–Ov site. With respect to the
Zr6cI–O2c site on the s-ZrO2(
111) surface, the activation barrier
for this reaction pathway decreases by 1.09 eV in the presence of
oxygen vacancy (Fig. 6) thus strongly facilitating propane
activation.
To check the importance of oxygen defects for activation of
methane, which is the most inert alkane, we computed breaking
C–H bond over the s-ZrO2(
111) and d-ZrO2(
111) surfaces.
Similarly to propane activation, Zr6cI–O2c and [Zr5cI, Zr6cII]-Ov
should be the corresponding active sites. The presence of oxygen
defect was established to be essential for breaking the C–H bond
in CH4, too. The activation barrier on the Zr6cI–O2c site is 1.14 eV
but is only 0.10 eV on the [Zr5cI, Zr6cII]-Ov site. Moreover, CH4
activation on the latter centre is exothermic by 1.06 eV.
C3H6 and H2 formation: After having identiﬁed the ﬁrst step of
propane activation over s-ZrO2(
111), we examined transforma-
tion routes of the Zr6cI–iso-C3H7 and H–O2c intermediates. The
most thermodynamically and kinetically preferred way for Zr6cI–
iso-C3H7 conversion is the cleavage of the methyl C–H bond at
the Zr6cIII site (Supplementary Fig. 20). It is an endothermic
process (0.46 eV) and has an activation barrier of 0.74 eV (C2 to
D2 in Fig. 6), which is 0.51 eV lower than that for the activation
of the ﬁrst methylene C–H bond in propane. The so-formed
propene adsorbs weakly (0.13 eV) at the Zr6cI site, while the co-
generated H fragment is bound to the neighbouring Zr6cIII site
(Fig. 6).
When one H atom is subtracted from the methyl group of
Zr5cI–iso-C3H7 stabilized on the d-ZrO2(
111) surface (Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Fig. 21), weakly adsorbed propene (0.46 eV) is
formed (TS2, Fig. 6). The remaining H atom is bound to the Zr5cI
and Zr6cIII cations. This process is endothermic by 0.42 eV and
has an activation barrier of 0.67 eV, which is slightly lower than
that (0.74 eV) required for the activation of Zr6cI–iso-C3H7 over
the stoichiometric surface. In addition to the mechanism and the
kinetics of propene formation, the presence of anion vacancies
also affects H2 formation (Fig. 6). This process on the s-ZrO2
(
111) surface has an effective activation barrier of 0.47 eV and is
exothermic by 0.28 eV, while the formation of H2 on the d-ZrO2
(
111) surface is endothermic by 1.40 eV (H2 dissociation is
barrierless).
Discussion
The work presented here explains at molecular level the impor-
tance of oxygen defects on the surface of ZrO2 for efﬁcient C–H
bond activation in C1–C4 alkanes. Owing to the presence of such
defects, this typically non-reducible metal oxide showed unex-
pectedly high activity in the non-oxidative propane dehy-
drogenation to propene and outperformed the state-of-the-art
catalysts possessing supported metal oxides or platinum. Its
unique performance is related to the presence of surface coordi-
natively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located at anion vacancies
in the lattice of ZrO2. Our DFT calculations predict that Zrcus
sites open an alternative pathway of propene and hydrogen for-
mation with a lower activation barrier in comparison with non-
defect ZrO2. Two Zrcus sites directly participate in homolitic C–H
bond activation, while lattice oxygen and zirconium cation are
required for this process on the stoichiometric surface of ZrO2.
Although the concentration of Zrcus can be adjusted in a con-
trolled manner through the size of ZrO2 crystallites, further
improvements are expected when the coordination number of
zirconium cations, their location on certain facets and/or the
shape of crystallites can also be tuned. Our approach presented
herein can be extended to other bulk oxides of non-reducible
metals and offers the opportunity for tailoring their acid–base
and redox properties as well as electrical conductivity for speciﬁc
applications.
Methods
Catalyst preparation. ZrO2 samples were prepared by hydrothermal, precipita-
tion, sol-gel, hard-template methods or simple decomposition of different zirco-
nium salts. The used chemicals and selected physico-chemical properties of the
synthesized materials are given in Supplementary Table 1. Further preparation
details are provided in Supplementary Note 1.
Catalyst characterization. XRD powder patterns were recorded on a Panalytical
X’Pert diffractometer equipped with a Xcelerator detector, automatic divergence slits
and Cu tube (kα1/α2 radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 0.015406 nm, 0.0154443 nm). Cu
beta-radiation was excluded by using nickel ﬁlter foil. The measurements were
performed in 0.0167° steps and 25 s of data collecting time per step. Peak positions
and proﬁle were ﬁtted with Pseudo-Voigt function using the HighScore Plus soft-
ware package (Panalytical). The PDF-2 database of the International Centre of
Diffraction Data (ICDD) was used for phase identiﬁcation. The integral breadth
method using the Scherrer equation under the assumption of spherically shaped
crystallites was applied for calculating crystallite size from the (
111) and (111)
reﬂection peak and the average values are reported. The K parameter was set to
1.0747. The adjustment of the used diffractometer is weekly checked according to the
Si (111) reﬂection peak at 28.433°. The deviation of the peak position is within the
standard deviation (0.004°). We have also measured XRD of ﬁve randomly taken
probes of ZrO2 with an estimated crystallite size of 9.1 nm, which is one of the lowest
values. The size of crystallites was determined with an error of 0.02 nm. Thus, the
error in determining the size of crystallites is below 1%.
Transmission electron microscopy measurements were carried out at 200 kV
with an aberration-corrected JEM-ARM200F (JEOL, Corrector: CEOS). The
aberration-corrected STEM imaging (High-Angle Annular Dark Field) was
performed with a spot size of approximately 0.1 nm, a convergence angle of 30–36o
and collection semi-angle of 90–170 mrad.
Acid–base, redox and electrical properties of selected samples were determined
from temperature-programmed desorption tests using CO, NH3 or C3H6 as probe
molecules, temperature-programmed reduction tests with H2 or CO and electrical
conductivity measurements respectively. Technical details of these tests are given in
Supplementary Note 2.
In situ UV-vis tests were performed at 550 °C in an in-house developed set-up
equipped with an AVASPEC ﬁbre optical spectrometer (Avantes), a DH-2000
deuterium-halogen light source and a CCD array detector. A high-temperature
reﬂection UV-vis probe consisting of six radiating optical ﬁbres and one reading
ﬁbre was threaded through the furnace to face quartz reactor walls at the position
where catalysts were held48. A feed containing 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 was used in
these tests. Initial propane conversion was about 10%.
For analysing carbon deposition during PDH, we deﬁned relative reﬂectance
(Rrel) as given in Eq. (1) as the ratio of the reﬂectance of the catalysts with coke
deposits (RDH) to the fully oxidized ones (RO2). From this reﬂectance, we calculated
the relative Kubelka–Munk function F(Rrel) according to Eq. (2).

Catalytic tests. Catalytic tests with C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 were performed at
1 bar between 550 and 625 °C using an in-house developed set-up consisting of 15
continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed quartz tubular (length and inner diameter are 465 and
4 mm, respectively) reactors operating in parallel. Tests with CH4 were carried out
at 800 °C in an in-house developed set-up consisting of six continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-
bed quartz tubular (length and inner diameter are 330 and 4 mm respectively)
reactors operating in parallel. Depending on speciﬁc purposes, catalytic tests were
performed with oxidized (treated in air at the reaction temperature) or reduced
(treated in either CO/N2 = 57/43 or H2/N2 = 57/43 at the reaction temperature)
catalysts. Feeds containing 40 vol% C2H6, 40 vol% C3H8, 40 vol% iso-C4H10 or
40 vol% CH4 in N2 were used. The feed components and the reaction products
were analysed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with
PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons) and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2 and
CO) columns as well as ﬂame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.

catalyst characteristics are provided in Supplementary Note 3.
DFT calculations. Spin-polarized and periodic density functional theory (DFT)
calculations were carried out by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP)49,50. Exchange and correlation were treated within the
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE)51.
To obtain accurate energies with errors of less than 1 meV per atom, a cut-off
energy of 400 eV was used. Geometry optimization was converged until forces
acting on atoms were lower than 0.02 eV/Å, whereas the energy threshold
deﬁning self-consistency of the electron density was set to 10−4 eV. The
climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method with eight images was
applied for ﬁnding transition states and minimum energy paths of all reac-
tions52. The ﬁnal transition state structures were reﬁned by using the quasi-
Newton algorithm until the Hellman–Feynman forces on each ion were lower
than 0.02 eV/Å. The normal mode frequency analysis was performed to validate
the optimized transition states and each authentic transition state has only one
imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinates. The resulted zero-point
vibrational energies (ZPE) from the frequency analysis are included in our
energetic comparison and discussion. For the optimization of the bulk structure,
the lattice parameters of the monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) phase were determined
by minimizing the total energy of the unit cell by using a conjugated gradient
algorithm to relax the ions. A 7×7×7 Monkhorst−Pack k point grid was used for
sampling the Brillouin zone53. Additional details are provided in Supplementary
Methods. In addition, we also tested the corrections of Hubbard term (PBE + U)
and dispersion (DFT + D3). These new data are now presented in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Fig. 23.
