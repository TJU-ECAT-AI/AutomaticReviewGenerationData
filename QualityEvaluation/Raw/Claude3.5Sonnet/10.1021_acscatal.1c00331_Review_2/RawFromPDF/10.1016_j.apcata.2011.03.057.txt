Propane dehydrogenation on Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4 was performed, and the Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4
catalyst showed a stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation than the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. In this
study, we propose that the high catalytic stability of Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster
coke mobility from the metal surface to the support, which was proven by XPS measurement. XRD and
HRTEM associated with EDX demonstrated that Pt–Sn alloy phases over the catalysts were transformed
during the reaction and that the bimetallic phase transition was different according to the supports. Both
PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys were formed on the reduced Pt–Sn/Al2O3, while only the PtSn alloy was observed
on the reduced Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4. The Pt3Sn phase was dominant over the spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3, whereas the
PtSn phase remained unchanged over the spent Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4 after reactions for 160 and 240 min. The
different bimetallic alloy formations and phase transitions in the Pt–Sn catalysts cause different coke
mobilities.

1. Introduction
The primary production method of propylene in the petrochem-
ical industry is naphtha cracking, wherein ethylene is co-produced.
The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethy-
lene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam
cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been consid-
ered to address the propylene shortfall.
The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been
widely studied in the dehydrogenation of parafﬁns and has a pos-
itive effect on the stability and selectivity to oleﬁns. The role of
tin is proposed to modify the electronic and geometric properties
of Pt by forming Pt–Sn alloys and dilution Pt sites, respectively
[1,2]. However, the stability of Pt–Sn supported catalysts is still
unsatisfactory. To improve the catalytic stability, several promot-
ers, including alkali metals (Li, K, Na) and rare earth metals (La, Ce),
have been added to Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts [3–7].
Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neu-
tral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical
strength [8–10]. Wang et al. [11] reported that ZnO modiﬁed Pt
dispersion and the interaction between the metal and support in

the Pt–Sn catalyst, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms
of the stability and selectivity. In Zn-doped PtSn catalysts, the high
selectivity and low activity loss were obtained in propane dehydro-
genation, due to the interaction between Pt and Zn [6]. The route
for synthesizing the supports also has a strong inﬂuence on the
activity and coke tolerance in parafﬁn dehydrogenation [12]. A zinc
aluminate support showed high catalytic performance with a Pt–Sn
bimetallic system in parafﬁn dehydrogenation [13,14].
Various characterization techniques have been applied to
understand the active phases in Pt–Sn catalysts, since the catalytic
performance strongly depends on the Pt–Sn bimetallic phases.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is an indirect method
to produce results on the Pt–Sn alloy system. According to TPR
data, a low quantity of Sn is reduced to Sn (0), and a Pt–Sn alloy
is formed by the interaction between Sn (0) and Pt; however, a
major portion of Sn (IV) is reduced to Sn (II) [15]. Another report
on TPR data proposed that proper Pt–Sn alloys were not formed,
and Sn is stabilized in the Sn (II) state [16]. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) indicated whether Pt–Sn alloy was formed. Pre-
vious literature revealed that tin is present only in an oxidized state
[17,18]. By contrast, Li et al. [19,20] reported that a portion of the
tin in Pt–Sn/Al2O3 is Sn (0); additionally, the composition of the
Pt–Sn alloy increases with increasing Sn/Pt atomic ratios. Direct
evidence for PtSn alloy formation was achieved from Mössbauer
data [21–23]; nevertheless, a complex spectrum was acquired,

resulting in some uncertainty in distinguishing Sn (0) from the
tin oxide phases. XRD has been used to directly conﬁrm the pres-
ence of different Pt–Sn alloys; however, this technique requires a
large amount of the formed Pt–Sn alloy to overcome the detection
limit [24–27]. XANES and EXAFS were applied to Pt–Sn/Al2O3 sam-
ples; however the data only presented the possibility of Pt–Sn alloy
formation [28]. Finally, HRTEM with a connected EDX and microd-
iffraction technique have also been used to identify Pt–Sn alloys
[29–31].
Although many characterization techniques have been used
for insight into the microstructure of Pt–Sn bimetallic catalyst
systems, the accurate nature of the Pt–Sn systems is compli-
cated and still a matter of debate, due to the dependence on
several factors, such as the support [32,33], method of catalyst
preparation [31,34,35], metallic precursor [26,36], sequence of
preparation [31,37], metal loading [31], and pretreatment condi-
tions [38].
In this study, we prepared Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4
catalysts and compared their catalytic performance in propane
dehydrogenation. To better understand the relationship between
the catalytic stability and the Pt–Sn bimetallic alloy system, the
Pt–Sn bimetallic phases were investigated through CO chemisorp-
tion, XRD, XPS, TPR, and HRTEM with fresh and spent catalysts.
The formation and transition of Pt–Sn alloy phases were directly
observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the dif-
ferent inﬂuences of the Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports on the
behavior of Pt–Sn alloy phases. Moreover, the different Pt–Sn
alloy phases led to differences in the coke mobility over the
catalysts and eventually had a strong effect on the catalyst
stability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Mesoporous aluminum and zinc aluminum oxide supports were
synthesized using previously described methods [39,40]. A pre-
determined amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥37.5% Pt
basis) and SnCl2·2H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥98%) were dissolved in
0.5 ml de-ionized water. Then, one aliquot containing 20 l of
precursor solution was evenly dispersed over Al2O3 or ZnAl2O4
support placed in a mortar. Then, the mixture was ground by a
pestle to make it homogeneous for ca. 5 min. This procedure was
repeated until the precursor solution completely ﬁlled the pore
volume of the supports. For Al2O3 support, all precursor solution
was consumed without intermediate drying stages; however, for
ZnAl2O4 support four intermediate drying stages were conducted
to consume all precursor solution because its pore volume is four
times lower than that of Al2O3 support. Catalysts were dried at
room temperature in a vacuum hood for 24 h before drying at 100 ◦C
for 12 h in an oven. The catalysts were calcined by heating from
room temperature to 550 ◦C (1 ◦C/min) and maintained at 550 ◦C
for 6 h. The Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst is denoted as
Pt–Sn/Al and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO, respectively. The loading amounts of
the Pt and Sn were 3.0 wt% on each catalyst.

2.2. Characterization
The surface areas and pore size distributions of the catalysts
were characterized by a nitrogen sorption technique (Micromerit-
ics ASAP 2020, USA). The samples were degassed under a vacuum
at 300 ◦C for 4 h prior to automatic analyzer analysis at −196.15 ◦C.
A BELCAT-B Catalyst analyzer (BEL Japan, Inc., Japan) with 10 vol.%
CO/He was used to determine metal dispersions. The coke content
was determined by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments
Q50, USA). Approximately 10 mg spent catalyst was charged into
the sample pan and heated to 800 ◦C at a rate of 20 ◦C/min in ﬂowing
air.
The XRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2200 pow-
der X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) using a Cu K
radiation source ( = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray tube was operated at
35 kV, 20 mA; the two theta angle was scanned from 10◦to 100◦
(step wise 0.02◦) at a speed of 2◦/min. The crystalline size of alloy
phases was calculated by Xpowder Pro ver. 2004.04.36. The high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) bright-ﬁeld
images and EDX spectra were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100F
(JEOL Ltd., Japan), and the particle size distribution histogram was
computed using ImageJ ver. 1.44c program (NIH, Bethesda, Mary-
land). Specimens were prepared by suspending and grinding in an
ethanol solution, and two drops of ethanol solution containing the
ground catalyst powder were placed onto a carbon ﬁlm-coated cop-
per grid. An XPS study of fresh and spent catalysts was conducted
via a Thermo VG Scientiﬁc ESCALAB-250 instrument (USA) with an
excitation source of AlK radiation. In addition to a binding energy
scan range from 0 to 1200 eV for the identiﬁcation of all detectable
elements, detailed scans for the chemical state identiﬁcation and
quantiﬁcation were obtained. Pt 4f and Sn 3d spectra were decon-
voluted using the Peakﬁt ver. 4.12 program (Systat Software, Inc.).
2.3. Reaction test
Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a ﬁxed-bed reactor
at 1 bar and 600 ◦C. The catalyst (100 mg) was reduced in situ in pure
H2 (50 ml/min) at 600 ◦C for 3 h and then purged by N2 (100 ml/min)
for 10 min to remove the remaining H2. Then, the reaction mixture
consisting of N2 (100 ml/min) and C3H8 (30 ml/min) was fed into
the reactor. The product was sampled at different intervals and ana-
lyzed by gas chromatography (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC, South
Korea). A ﬂame ionization detector and a 30 m × 0.53 mm HP-PLOT
Al2O3 “KCl” capillary column were used. The catalysts were regen-
erated by ﬂowing a mixture of N2 (40 ml/min) and air (20 ml/min)
at 600 ◦C for 1 h, and then, re-reduced in pure H2 (50 ml/min) at
600 ◦C for 3 h. Reactants in all the recycling tests were a mixture of
N2 (50 ml/min) and C3H8 (15 ml/min). This lower ﬂow rate for the
recycling tests was used to easily discriminate decrease in catalyst
activity along with ﬁve recycles.
Propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated
by the following formulae:
Propane conversion (%) = n(C3H8)in −n(C3H8)out
n(C3H8)in
× 100
Propylene selectivity (%)
=
n(C3H6)out
n(C3H6)out + n(C2H6)out + n(C2H4)out + n(CH4)out
× 100
where n(C3H8)in and n(CxHy)out are the moles of propane from the
inlet and numbers of moles of products from the outlet, respec-
tively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reaction tests
A blank reaction test was performed in an empty reactor at
600 ◦C and the propane conversion by pyrolysis was negligible
in this study. The reaction test was performed on each catalyst
with two different time-on-streams (TOS = 160 and 240 min). The
propane conversion vs. TOS and propylene selectivity vs. propane
conversion are illustrated in Fig. 1. For all of the catalysts, the
selectivity decreased gradually with decreasing propane conver-
sion. Under a longer TOS, the propane conversion decreased while
the coke deposits on the catalysts were generated through crack-
28

ing, hydrogenolysis, and pyrolysis, resulting in a small decrease
in propylene selectivity. To relatively compare the catalytic sta-
bility between Pt–Sn/Al and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts, a deactivation
parameter was deﬁned as De = Xf/X0, where Xf and X0 is the ﬁnal
and initial propane conversion. Based on the calculation (Table 1),
the De of Pt–Sn/Al (0.19 or 0.16) was remarkably less than the De
of Pt–Sn/ZnAlO (0.46). This indicates that the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO cata-
lyst had a much stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation, as
compared to the Pt–Sn/Al catalyst.
The amount of coke generated in the reaction was measured
by TGA. With increasing TOS, the coke content naturally increased
on both catalysts (Table 1). The coke content of all the catalysts
appeared less than those of monometallic catalysts [39]. Under
similar reaction conditions, a monometallic Pt/alumina catalyst
produced 19 wt% coke during the reaction, while coke contents of
the bimetallic catalytic system (Pt–Sn catalysts) ranged from 2.5 to
6.1 wt%. The addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessened the
coke generation. In addition, the use of ZnAl2O4 led to a decrease in
coke content. With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1
and 6.1 wt% whereas the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5
and 4.9 wt% coke. Therefore, the ZnAl2O4 support plays an impor-
tant role in the suppression of the generation of coke during the
reaction.
To further validate the stability of each catalyst, we performed
the recycling tests for each catalyst, and the results are shown in
Fig. 2. Both the Pt–Sn/Al and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts were deacti-
vated along with the recycling; however, the deactivation rate of
the Pt–Sn/Al was much faster than that of Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst
as the numbers of cycles increased. For quantitative comparison,
the initial and ﬁnal conversions over Pt–Sn/Al, in the ﬁrst cycle,
were 54.9 and 34.6%, respectively while those over Pt–Sn/ZnAlO
were 59.1 and 48.1%, respectively. In the ﬁfth cycle, the initial
and ﬁnal conversions over Pt–Sn/Al were 52.5 and 15.2%, respec-
tively while over Pt–Sn/ZnAl2O4, the initial and ﬁnal conversions
were 56.5 and 30.4%, respectively. This observation indicates that a
remarkable improvement of catalytic stability was obtained over
Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst. However, the standard deviations of ini-
tial conversions (5 cycles) were 2.2 and 1.4% over Pt–Sn/Al and
Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts, respectively. This implies that the con-
tribution of sintering process to catalytic deactivation was not
signiﬁcant.
3.2. Adsorption measurements
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Al2O3, Pt–Sn/Al,
ZnAl2O4, and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO were irreversible type IV isotherms of
mesoporous materials with a well-deﬁned hysteresis loop of type
H2 (not shown). This observation indicates that their pore structure
has pores with interconnecting channels or wormholes or sponge-
like in appearance [41]. Even though the surface area of the Al2O3
support is twice as much as that of ZnAl2O4 support, the Pt disper-
sions measured by CO chemisorption in Table 1 shows the lower
Pt dispersion of Pt–Sn/Al catalysts than that of the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO
catalyst.
3.3. XRD measurement
Figs. 3a and 4a show the XRD patterns of calcined Pt–Sn/Al
and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts, respectively. The Pt metal phase (PDF
No.: 00-004-0802) can be identiﬁed by the characteristic peak at
2 = 39.8◦on both calcined catalysts. This observation is consistent
with a previous report wherein at temperatures greater than 510 ◦C
(in He or air ﬂow) the Pt precursor (H2PtCl6·6H2O) decomposed
into Pt metal and other products [42]. The calcination temperature
(550 ◦C) in our experiment was sufﬁciently high to form the metal-
lic Pt phase. In addition to the metallic Pt phase, the gamma phase of

Al2O3 (PDF No.: 00-029-0063) and ZnAl2O4 (PDF No.: 00-005-0669)
were also detected in the calcined catalysts.
Upon reducing, the metallic Pt nearly combined with metal-
lic Sn to form Pt–Sn alloys, as shown in Figs. 3b and 4b. The
insets of Figs. 3 and 4 show the most intense peaks of the
Pt and bimetallic phase. In the XRD patterns of the reduced
catalysts, PtSn (AMCSD No.: 99-101-0506) and Pt3Sn (PDF No.:
00-035-1360) phases formed on the Pt–Sn/Al catalyst while PtSn
and PtZn phases formed on the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst. The d-
spacing values (at d = 2.210, 1.750, 1.321, 1.197 and 1.077 ˚
A) of
the PtZn alloy observed on Pt–Sn/ZnAlO corroborate literature
values reported for the -PtZn alloy (d = 3.511, 2.214, 1.748 and
1.198 ˚
A), which was thought to be an inactive phase for hydrogen
chemisorption and dehydrogenation of parafﬁns [9,43]. However,
the existence of the PtZn alloy phase on the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst
indicates a strong interaction between Pt particles and the ZnAl2O4
support.
It has been identiﬁed that the bulk Pt–Sn system forms the
following alloys: Pt3Sn, PtSn, Pt2Sn3, PtSn2, and PtSn4 [44]. The one-
to-one atomic composition (PtSn) is most frequently detected on
Pt–Sn/supports catalysts by several techniques, although all types
of Pt–Sn alloys are possible [22,24–27]. In addition, two Pt–Zn alloys
(PtZn, Pt3Zn) were detected by XRD when zinc aluminate was used
as a support [43,45]. The inﬂuence of the Al2O3 surface area and

Pt/Sn atomic ratio (1–8) on the formation of the Pt–Sn alloy has
been previously studied [24], and the study shows that only one
Pt–Sn alloy (Pt:Sn = 1:1) was observed with varying surface area
and Pt/Sn atomic ratio. However, on the Al2O3 support, the var-
ious Pt–Sn alloys, such as Pt3Sn, PtSn and PtSn2 were detected
by XRD in other reports [25,35]. The formation of the Pt–Sn alloy
with various Pt/Sn atomic ratios (0.2–1.78) on the ZnAl2O4 sup-
port was also examined in a previous report, and it is noted that
the most stable alloy was PtSn, in addition to a trace amount of
Pt2Sn3 [45]. As a result, the possible formation of Pt–Sn alloys
on the supported catalysts should be different from that on the
unsupported Pt–Sn catalysts as the same Pt/Sn atomic ratios were
compared. Although, in our samples, the Pt/Sn (1/1.77) atomic
ratios were greater than that for the formation of the Pt2Sn3 alloy
in the bulk Pt–Sn phase diagram, two alloys (PtSn and Pt3Sn) were
observed on the Pt–Sn/Al catalyst and only one alloy (PtSn) was
observed on the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst, as shown in the XRD patterns
of Figs. 3 and 4.
Figs. 3c, d and 4c, d show the XRD patterns of the spent cat-
alysts. In addition to the reaction time, there was a change in
the peak intensities. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the charac-
teristic peak for Pt3Sn increased remarkably with reaction time,
while PtSn nearly disappeared, indicating that the phase tran-
sition of the Pt–Sn alloy occurred during the reaction. On the
contrary, over the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst, the PtSn alloy was not
transformed to the Pt3Sn alloy. The characteristic peak of PtSn in
the inset of Fig. 4 remained nearly unchanged during the reaction.
We believe that the strong interaction between the Pt particles and
ZnAl2O4 support suppresses the migration of Pt particles over the
support.
The active motion of the metal particles over supports at a high
temperature produced the phase transition of the Pt–Sn alloy. In

literature, it was reported that Sn segregation from Pt–Sn alloy
during coke burning was observed by the intensity contour map
of the HERFD XANES spectra [46]. Another study suggested that Sn
spreads onto the support during reduction, which was conﬁrmed
by EDX analysis. It was observed a decrease in Sn-rich particle size
and a shift toward high Pt weight percent in all metal particles [30].
From those ﬁndings and our evidence, Sn can be segregated from
Pt–Sn alloy and mobile onto the support during reduction, reac-
tion, and coke burning at high reaction temperatures in propane
dehydrogenation.

to the (2 0 0) and (1 1 1) reﬂection planes of the Pt3Sn alloy, respec-

that corroborate the (1 0 1) and (1 0 0) reﬂection planes of the PtSn

respectively. The FFT of zones (II) and (III) show three reﬂection
planes with spacings of 0.2, 0.30, and 0.35 nm−1 that correspond to
(1 1 0), (1 0 1), and (1 0 0) reﬂection planes of the PtSn alloy, respec-
tively; the lattice spacing of 0.22 nm−1 was likely to indicate the
(1 0 2) reﬂection plane of the PtSn alloy. Fig. 5C and D shows HRTEM
images of the spent Pt–Sn/Al catalyst. When FFT was employed on
the particles, the (1 1 1) reﬂection plane of the Pt3Sn alloy with a lat-
tice spacing of 0.23 nm−1 was observed. In contrast, in the HRTEM
images of the spent Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst (Fig. 6B and C), a lattice
spacing of ca. 0.3 and 0.36 nm−1 was obtained, which provided evi-
dence for the formation of the PtSn alloy and strongly corroborates
the XRD data in this study.
The elemental compositions of the particles were analyzed by
EDX in the “spot mode”, and an example of the collected EDX spec-
trum from a single particle on reduced Pt–Sn/Al and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO
catalysts are shown in Fig. 7A and B, respectively. The elemen-
tal composition of the particles indicates the presence of Pt and
Sn on Pt–Sn/Al while Pt, Sn, and Zn were observed in particles on
Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst. Alternatively, Fig. 7C illustrates the box chart
(25 particles/each sample) of the Pt/Sn atomic ratio vs. the reac-
tion time from the reduced and spent Pt–Sn/Al catalysts, indicating
a change in composition of the metallic particles during the reac-
tion. The Pt/Sn atomic ratio increased as the reaction time increased
from 0 to 240 min, which is consistent with XRD analysis mentioned
before. Alternatively, the Pt/Sn ratio was too complicated to achieve
for the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts, because of the difﬁcult exclusion of
Zn from the ZnAl2O4 support. Notably, the EDX spectra from the
support zones of the Pt–Sn/Al catalysts showed the existence of a
Sn element, whereas both Pt and Sn were present on the support
zones of the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts.
3.5. XPS measurement
XPS spectra of Pt 4f and Sn 3d levels for the Pt–Sn/Al and
Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. XPS of Pt 4f
(Fig. 8) show the doublets corresponding to zero-valence Pt; Pt
4f7/2 (ca. 71.3 eV) and Pt 4f5/2 (ca. 74.6 eV) with a peak separa-
tion of 3.3 eV and an area ratio of 1.33 were applied for the ﬁtting
procedures. As shown in Fig. 8A, with increasing reaction time,
the peak intensity of Pt 4f decreased compared to the peak inten-
sity of Al 2p (dashed line). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 8B, the
peak intensity of Pt 4f increased rapidly with the reaction time,
while that of Al 2p decreased. The Sn 3d5/2 peaks can be decom-
posed into four components (Fig. 9): ca. 483.0 eV attributed to Sn
(0), ca. 485.5 eV was assigned to Sn in the Pt–Sn alloy (Snal(0))
[38,47], ca. 486.5 eV was attributed to oxidized Sn (II, IV), and ca.
488.6 eV was known as SnClx species bound to the support [9,19].
On Pt–Sn/Al, the relative intensity of Snal(0) decreases with reac-
tion time (Fig. 9A), whereas it increases on the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst
(Fig. 9B).
The quantitative results for XPS are shown in Table 2. On the
Pt–Sn/Al catalysts, the Pt/Al and Snal(0)/Al ratio declined, while
the SnS/Al ratio increased as the reaction time increased from 0
to 240 min. This observation contradicted the data on Pt–Sn/ZnAlO
catalysts, for which the Pt/Al and Snal(0)/Al ratio increased, while
the SnS/Al ratio decreased remarkably during the same reaction
time. These observations suggested that the mobility of the coke
formed on the Pt–Sn/Al catalyst was different from that formed on
the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst. Coke located on the supports resulted
in the attenuation of Al and SnS signals; however, coke located on
metallic sites led to the attenuation of the Pt and Snal(0) signal.
The data indicated that, in the case of the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst,
coke formed on the Pt–Sn alloys had a high mobility and trans-
port to the ZnAlO support. Alternatively, for the Pt–Sn/Al catalyst,
coke formed on the Pt–Sn alloys had low mobility and adsorbed
strongly to surfaces of the Pt–Sn alloys. Moreover, the fraction of
the oxidized Sn species increased relative to the total Sn species on
Pt–Sn/Al and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalysts, indicating that these oxidized
Sn species exist as an isolated phase on both supports and were not
covered by coke.

The coke generated in propane dehydrogenation consists of
polyaromatic rings containing sp2 hybridization carbon [48]. The
mobility of coke is related to interactions between the metallic
sites and coke formed; strong interactions lead to weak mobility,
and vice versa. Speciﬁcally, a high electron density of Pt particles
plays an important role in weakening Pt-(C C) bonds and, there-
fore, repulsing the coke precursors. The temperature-programmed
desorption experiments revealed that desorption of the pi-bond
molecules on the unsupported PtSn alloy became progressively eas-
ier than those on the unsupported Pt3Sn alloy [2]. Therefore, the
transport of coke was probably related to the interaction between
metallic sites and pi-bond molecules, as previously mentioned.
Pt3Sn, PtSn, Pt2Sn3, PtSn2, and PtSn4 had similar bonding natures
between Pt and Sn: hybridization between Pt-d and Sn-p states.
However, the lowest enthalpy formation was observed on the PtSn
alloy, as experimentally measured and calculated by density func-
tional theory [49]. A highly negative value of enthalpy formation
of the PtSn alloy indicates a strong electron transfer from Sn to the
d-orbital of Pt [46]. Consequently, the bond strength between Pt
and coke precursors in the PtSn alloy weakens and results in the
high mobility of coke.
4. Conclusions
As characterized by XRD and HRTEM, both PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys
were formed on the reduced Pt–Sn/Al catalyst, and the Pt3Sn alloy
became a dominant phase after reaction for 240 min. On the other
hand, only the PtSn alloy was formed on the reduced Pt–Sn/ZnAlO
catalyst and remained stable after 240 min of reaction. The PtSn and
Pt3Sn alloy in the reduced and spent catalysts exhibited homogene-
ity without core–shell structures. Both Pt–Sn/Al and Pt–Sn/ZnAlO
catalysts exhibited deactivation with time on the stream; however,
the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst showed a higher tolerance for deactiva-
tion than the Pt–Sn/Al catalyst. Therefore, the dominant Pt3Sn alloy
was likely responsible for faster deactivation of the Pt–Sn/Al than
that of the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO catalyst. The amount of coke accumulated
on the Pt–Sn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the Pt–Sn/Al cata-
lyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support
on Pt–Sn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the Pt–Sn/Al catalyst.
This study reveals that the stability of a Pt–Sn/support catalyst
depends on the type of Pt–Sn alloy, relating to the coke transport
phenomena, as evidenced by XPS.
