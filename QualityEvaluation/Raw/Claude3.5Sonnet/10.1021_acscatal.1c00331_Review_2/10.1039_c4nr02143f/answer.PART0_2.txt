[1] "The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min1 by nitrogen."

[2] "The premixed reactant mixture with fixed compositions of propane, hydrogen, and nitrogen was introduced into the reactor using mass flow controllers"

The literature does not provide detailed information about how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The text only mentions that hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio, but does not discuss its effects. Without more information, the implications for process efficiency and performance cannot be determined based solely on this document.

该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何具体影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积炭形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机理、能量障碍、积炭累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的详细信息。文本仅提到氢气与丙烷以1:1的比例共同进料,但没有讨论其影响。没有更多信息的情况下,仅凭这份文件无法确定对工艺效率和性能的影响。
