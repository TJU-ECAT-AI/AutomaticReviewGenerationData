[1] "The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min1 by nitrogen."

[2] "The premixed reactant mixture with fixed compositions of propane, hydrogen, and nitrogen was introduced into the reactor using mass flow controllers"

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document only mentions that hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio, but does not discuss its impacts on the aspects mentioned in the question. To properly address this question, more specific research on the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。文档仅提到氢气与丙烷以1:1的比例共进料,但没有讨论它对问题中提到的各个方面的影响。要正确回答这个问题,需要对PDH中氢气共进料的影响进行更具体的研究。
