[1] "The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min1 by nitrogen."

[2] "The hydrogen uptake as well as the metal dispersion."

[3] "The weight loss at 150 C can be attributed to the combustion of the adsorbed H atoms on catalysts."

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer this question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The text only mentions that hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio, and that some hydrogen adsorbs on the catalyst surface. It does not discuss how hydrogen cofeeding impacts energy barriers, coke accumulation, acid sites, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More research would be needed to comprehensively address the question's specific points about hydrogen's role in PDH.

这篇文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答这个关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的问题。文本仅提到氢气与丙烷以1:1的比例共进料,以及一些氢气吸附在催化剂表面。它没有讨论氢气共进料如何影响能量障碍、焦炭累积、酸性位点、石墨化或整体过程效率。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答该问题中关于氢气在PDH中作用的具体方面。
