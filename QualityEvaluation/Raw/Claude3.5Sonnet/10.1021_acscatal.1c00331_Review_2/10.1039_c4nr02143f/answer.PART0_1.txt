[1] "The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min1 by nitrogen."

[2] "The premixed reactant mixture with fixed compositions of propane, hydrogen, and nitrogen was introduced into the reactor using mass flow controllers (D07-19B, Sevenstar)."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The document only mentions that hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio, but does not discuss its specific impacts. Without more information, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance for PDH.

该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机理、能垒、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的详细信息。文献仅提到氢气与丙烷以1:1的比例共进料,但没有讨论其具体影响。由于缺乏更多信息,无法就氢气共进料对PDH整体过程效率和性能的影响得出结论。
