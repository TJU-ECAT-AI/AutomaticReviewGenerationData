[1] "The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min1 by nitrogen."

[2] "The premixed reactant mixture with fixed compositions of propane, hydrogen, and nitrogen was introduced into the reactor using mass flow controllers"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document only mentions that hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio, but does not discuss its impacts on the aspects mentioned in the question. To properly address this question, more specific research on the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed.

The literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The document only mentions that hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio, but does not discuss its specific impacts. Without more information, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance for PDH.

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer this question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The text only mentions that hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio, and that some hydrogen adsorbs on the catalyst surface. It does not discuss how hydrogen cofeeding impacts energy barriers, coke accumulation, acid sites, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More research would be needed to comprehensively address the question's specific points about hydrogen's role in PDH.

[1] "The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min1 by nitrogen."

[2] "The addition of promoters such as Sn,2,7,12,14 La,11,15 Ga16 and Zn17 species has been reported to be effective."

[3] "The PtCu interaction inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture."

[4] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt-Cu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, based on the limited information provided:

1. Hydrogen was cofed with propane in a 1:1 ratio during the PDH reaction.

2. The addition of promoters like Cu to Pt catalysts inhibits propylene adsorption and increases the energy barrier for C-C bond rupture.

3. These effects from promoters (which may be similar to hydrogen cofeeding) reduce coke formation by diminishing propylene adsorption and subsequent polymerization reactions.

4. The higher energy barrier for C-C bond cleavage suppresses methane formation and cracking reactions.

5. While not directly stated for hydrogen, these mechanisms likely improve catalyst stability by reducing coke accumulation.

The overall impact on process efficiency and performance is not explicitly discussed for hydrogen cofeeding. More specific research on hydrogen's effects in PDH would be needed to fully answer the question.

文献中并没有提供关于氢气共进料如何特别影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的全面信息。但是，根据所提供的有限信息：

1. 在PDH反应中，氢气与丙烷以1:1的比例共同进料。

2. 向Pt催化剂中添加Cu等助剂可抑制丙烯吸附，并提高C-C键断裂的能量障碍。

3. 这些来自助剂的影响（可能与氢气共进料类似）通过减少丙烯吸附和随后的聚合反应来减少积碳形成。

4. 更高的C-C键断裂能量障碍抑制了甲烷的形成和裂解反应。

5. 虽然没有直接针对氢气说明，但这些机制可能通过减少积碳积累来提高催化剂的稳定性。

文献中没有明确讨论氢气共进料对工艺效率和性能的整体影响。需要对氢气在PDH中的影响进行更具体的研究才能全面回答这个问题。
