[1] "It was found that the addition of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane. Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles."

[2] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."

[3] "When examining the effect of increasing H2 content in the feed several trends are observed. First of all, the D band becomes more prominent with respect to the G band. Furthermore, the Raman bands become narrower and the positions appear to shift to lower wavenumbers."

[4] "Summarizing, three trends can be observed in the operando Raman spectra, as the H2 concentration in the feed is increased. First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects. Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased. Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."

[5] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Catalyst stability: The addition of hydrogen increases catalyst stability by decreasing the drop in conversion between cycles. This leads to a more stable catalyst performance over time.

2. Coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding results in the formation of less coke overall. The coke that does form is more graphitic in nature and tends to cover mainly the catalyst support rather than the active Pt sites.

3. Coke structure: As hydrogen concentration increases, the coke deposits become more ordered with fewer defects. The graphitic crystallites become smaller in size.

4. Active site protection: Hydrogen assists in keeping the surface of the Pt nanoparticles free of disordered coke species, which helps maintain catalyst activity.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The addition of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane, suggesting it positively influences the dehydrogenation reaction pathway.

6. Coke accumulation patterns: In the presence of hydrogen, coke tends to form more on the catalyst support rather than on the active Pt sites, which helps maintain catalyst activity.

These effects have important implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to increased stability and reduced deactivation.
2. Higher propane conversion rates, potentially leading to improved product yields.
3. Reduced need for frequent catalyst regeneration, as the more graphitic coke formed is less detrimental to catalyst performance.
4. Potential for optimizing hydrogen concentration in the feed to balance between coke suppression and maintaining desirable reaction conditions.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding appears to be a promising strategy for improving the efficiency and performance of the PDH process by mitigating catalyst deactivation and maintaining higher activity levels over extended periods.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中添加氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著的影响：

1. 催化剂稳定性：添加氢气可以提高催化剂的稳定性，减少循环之间转化率的下降。这导致催化剂性能随时间推移更加稳定。

2. 焦炭形成：氢气共进料导致总体形成的焦炭更少。形成的焦炭性质更趋向于石墨化，且主要覆盖在催化剂载体上，而不是活性Pt位点上。

3. 焦炭结构：随着氢气浓度的增加，焦炭沉积物变得更有序，缺陷更少。石墨晶体的尺寸变小。

4. 活性位点保护：氢气有助于保持Pt纳米粒子表面不被无序焦炭物种覆盖，这有助于维持催化剂活性。

5. 反应机理：添加氢气增加了丙烷的转化率，表明它对脱氢反应路径有积极影响。

6. 焦炭积累模式：在氢气存在的情况下，焦炭倾向于更多地形成在催化剂载体上，而不是活性Pt位点上，这有助于维持催化剂活性。

这些影响对整体过程效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 由于稳定性增加和失活减少，催化剂寿命得到改善。
2. 更高的丙烷转化率，可能导致产品产量提高。
3. 减少频繁催化剂再生的需求，因为形成的更加石墨化的焦炭对催化剂性能的影响较小。
4. 有潜力优化进料中的氢气浓度，以平衡焦炭抑制和维持理想反应条件之间的关系。

总的来说，氢气共进料似乎是一种有前景的策略，可以通过减轻催化剂失活和长期维持更高活性水平来提高PDH过程的效率和性能。
