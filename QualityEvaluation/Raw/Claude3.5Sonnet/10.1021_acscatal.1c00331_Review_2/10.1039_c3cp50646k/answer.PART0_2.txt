[1] "The presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane. Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles."

[2] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles. At the start of the first cycle only cracking products are detected, but over the course of this cycle the selectivity towards propene increases. After a few cycles the addition of hydrogen in fact increases the selectivity towards propene."

[3] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."

[4] "When examining the effect of increasing H2 content in the feed several trends are observed. First of all, the D band becomes more prominent with respect to the G band. Furthermore, the Raman bands become narrower and the positions appear to shift to lower wavenumbers."

[5] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition leads to the formation of less coke overall, but the coke that does form is more graphitic in nature. This graphitic coke tends to deposit mainly on the catalyst support rather than on the active Pt sites.

2. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen improves catalyst stability by decreasing the drop in conversion between dehydrogenation cycles. It helps keep the Pt surface free of disordered coke species, which would otherwise deactivate the catalyst more rapidly.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Initially, hydrogen addition lowers propene selectivity and promotes cracking reactions. However, after a few cycles, it increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen alters the reaction pathways, possibly by modifying the nature of active sites on the catalyst surface.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly mentioned, the changes in selectivity and conversion imply that hydrogen affects the energy barriers of different reaction pathways, favoring dehydrogenation over cracking reactions after initial cycles.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen changes the pattern of coke accumulation, promoting the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites on the catalyst support rather than disordered coke on active Pt sites.

6. Acid site conversions: The document does not directly address acid site conversions, but the changes in selectivity suggest that hydrogen may affect the nature or availability of acidic sites on the catalyst.

7. Graphitization: Hydrogen promotes the formation of more graphitic coke, as evidenced by changes in the Raman spectra of the coke deposits.

These effects have significant implications for overall process efficiency and performance. The improved catalyst stability and increased selectivity towards propene after initial cycles suggest that hydrogen cofeeding can enhance the longevity and productivity of PDH catalysts. However, the initial decrease in selectivity indicates that careful optimization of hydrogen concentration and process conditions is necessary to maximize the benefits of hydrogen addition.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响有以下几个方面：

1. 焦炭形成：添加氢气导致总体上形成的焦炭较少，但形成的焦炭性质更加石墨化。这种石墨化焦炭倾向于主要沉积在催化剂载体上，而不是活性Pt位点上。

2. 催化剂稳定性：氢气通过减少脱氢循环之间的转化率下降来提高催化剂稳定性。它有助于保持Pt表面不被无序焦炭物种覆盖，否则这些物种会更快地使催化剂失活。

3. 反应机理：最初，添加氢气会降低丙烯选择性并促进裂解反应。然而，经过几个循环后，它会增加丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这表明氢气改变了反应途径，可能是通过修改催化剂表面活性位点的性质。

4. 能量壁垒：虽然没有明确提及，但选择性和转化率的变化暗示氢气影响了不同反应途径的能量壁垒，在初始循环后有利于脱氢反应而不是裂解反应。

5. 焦炭积累模式：氢气改变了焦炭积累的模式，促进在催化剂载体上形成较小、更有序的石墨晶体，而不是在活性Pt位点上形成无序焦炭。

6. 酸性位点转化：文档没有直接提到酸性位点转化，但选择性的变化表明氢气可能影响催化剂上酸性位点的性质或可用性。

7. 石墨化：氢气促进了更多石墨化焦炭的形成，这从焦炭沉积物的拉曼光谱变化中可以看出。

这些效应对整体过程效率和性能有重要影响。改善的催化剂稳定性和初始循环后增加的丙烯选择性表明，氢气共进料可以提高PDH催化剂的寿命和生产力。然而，初始选择性的降低表明，需要仔细优化氢气浓度和工艺条件，以最大化氢气添加的益处。
