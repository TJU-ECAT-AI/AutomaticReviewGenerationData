[1] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles. At the start of the first cycle only cracking products are detected, but over the course of this cycle the selectivity towards propene increases. After a few cycles the addition of hydrogen in fact increases the selectivity towards propene."

[2] "From the 4th cycle onward, the yield increases as more H2 is added. This effect of H2 on the performance of the catalyst is in fact quite similar to the addition of Sn, as it increases both the propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane. Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles. This drop in conversion is unrelated to the H2 content of the feed."

[4] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."

[5] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition leads to the formation of less coke overall, with the coke that does form being more graphitic in nature. This graphitic coke tends to deposit mainly on the catalyst support rather than on the active Pt sites.

2. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen cofeeding increases catalyst stability by decreasing the drop in conversion between cycles. This effect is particularly pronounced for the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Initially, hydrogen addition lowers propene selectivity, but after a few cycles, it increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen affects the reaction pathway, possibly by altering the surface coverage of different species on the catalyst.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly stated, the increased conversion with hydrogen addition implies that hydrogen may lower the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen changes the nature of coke deposits, favoring the formation of smaller, more ordered graphitic crystallites. This change in coke structure likely contributes to improved catalyst performance.

6. Acid site conversions: The literature does not directly address the effect of hydrogen on acid site conversions.

7. Graphitization: Hydrogen promotes the formation of more graphitic coke, which is less detrimental to catalyst performance compared to disordered coke.

These effects have several implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to increased stability and reduced deactivation.
2. Higher propene yields, especially after the initial few cycles.
3. Potential for longer operation times between regeneration cycles.
4. More efficient use of the catalyst surface, as hydrogen helps keep active Pt sites free from coke.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding appears to be a promising strategy for improving the efficiency and performance of the PDH process, particularly over extended periods of operation.

氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气的添加导致总体焦炭形成量减少，形成的焦炭性质更趋向于石墨化。这种石墨化焦炭主要沉积在催化剂载体上，而不是活性Pt位点上。

2. 催化剂稳定性：氢气共进料通过减少循环间转化率的下降来提高催化剂稳定性。这种效果在Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上尤为明显。

3. 反应机理：最初，氢气的添加会降低丙烯选择性，但经过几个循环后，它会同时提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这表明氢气影响了反应途径，可能是通过改变催化剂表面不同物种的覆盖度。

4. 能量障碍：虽然没有明确说明，但氢气添加后转化率的提高暗示氢气可能降低了脱氢反应的能量障碍。

5. 焦炭积累模式：氢气改变了焦炭沉积物的性质，有利于形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体。焦炭结构的这种变化可能有助于提高催化剂性能。

6. 酸性位点转化：文献没有直接提到氢气对酸性位点转化的影响。

7. 石墨化：氢气促进了更多石墨化焦炭的形成，这种焦炭相比无序焦炭对催化剂性能的影响较小。

这些效应对整体过程效率和性能有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 由于稳定性提高和失活减少，催化剂寿命延长。
2. 特别是在最初几个循环后，丙烯产率更高。
3. 再生循环之间可能有更长的操作时间。
4. 催化剂表面利用更高效，因为氢气有助于保持活性Pt位点不被焦炭覆盖。

总的来说，氢气共进料似乎是一种有前景的策略，可以提高PDH过程的效率和性能，特别是在长期操作中。
