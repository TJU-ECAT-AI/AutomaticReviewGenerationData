[1] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles. At the start of the first cycle only cracking products are detected, but over the course of this cycle the selectivity towards propene increases. After a few cycles the addition of hydrogen in fact increases the selectivity towards propene."

[2] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance."

[3] "First of all, the increase in H2 partial pressure will result in more H2 adsorbing on the active sites of the catalyst, effectively reducing the concentration of coke precursors on the catalyst material. This results in less coke being deposited, as the coke formed from these precursors makes active sites permanently unavailable for the dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "When examining the effect of increasing H2 content in the feed several trends are observed. First of all, the D band becomes more prominent with respect to the G band. Furthermore, the Raman bands become narrower and the positions appear to shift to lower wavenumbers."

[5] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen reduces the formation of coke deposits on the catalyst. It does this by adsorbing onto active sites, reducing the concentration of coke precursors. The coke that does form tends to be more graphitic and mainly covers the catalyst support rather than the active Pt sites.

2. Catalyst stability: The addition of hydrogen increases catalyst stability, particularly for the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is likely due to the reduced coke formation on active sites, allowing the catalyst to maintain its activity over more cycles.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Initially, hydrogen addition lowers propene selectivity and increases cracking products. However, after a few cycles, it increases both conversion and selectivity towards propene. This suggests that hydrogen alters the reaction pathways, possibly by changing the nature of active sites or the way reactants interact with the catalyst surface.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly discussed, the changes in selectivity and conversion imply that hydrogen affects the energy barriers of different reaction pathways. It may lower the barrier for propane dehydrogenation while increasing barriers for side reactions like cracking.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen changes how coke accumulates on the catalyst. With hydrogen, coke tends to form more ordered, graphitic structures primarily on the support. Without hydrogen, more disordered coke forms on both the support and Pt nanoparticles.

6. Acid site conversions: The literature doesn't directly address this, but the changes in selectivity and coke formation patterns suggest that hydrogen may affect how acid sites on the catalyst behave or are converted during the reaction.

7. Graphitization: Hydrogen promotes the formation of more graphitic coke structures, as evidenced by changes in the Raman spectra of the coked catalysts.

These effects have significant implications for process efficiency and performance. By increasing catalyst stability, conversion, and selectivity while reducing harmful coke deposition on active sites, hydrogen cofeeding can potentially improve the overall efficiency and longevity of the PDH process. However, the optimal hydrogen concentration (around 25% for Pt-Sn/Al2O3) needs to be determined for each catalyst system to maximize these benefits.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气减少了催化剂上焦炭沉积的形成。它通过吸附在活性位点上，降低了焦炭前体的浓度。形成的焦炭倾向于更加石墨化，主要覆盖在催化剂载体上，而不是活性Pt位点。

2. 催化剂稳定性：添加氢气增加了催化剂的稳定性，特别是对于Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂。这可能是由于活性位点上焦炭形成的减少，使催化剂能够在更多循环中保持其活性。

3. 反应机理：最初，添加氢气降低了丙烯选择性并增加了裂解产物。然而，经过几个循环后，它增加了丙烯的转化率和选择性。这表明氢气改变了反应途径，可能是通过改变活性位点的性质或反应物与催化剂表面的相互作用方式。

4. 能量障碍：虽然没有明确讨论，但选择性和转化率的变化暗示氢气影响了不同反应途径的能量障碍。它可能降低了丙烷脱氢的障碍，同时增加了裂解等副反应的障碍。

5. 焦炭积累模式：氢气改变了焦炭在催化剂上的积累方式。有氢气时，焦炭倾向于在载体上形成更有序的石墨结构。没有氢气时，更无序的焦炭在载体和Pt纳米粒子上都形成。

6. 酸性位点转化：文献并未直接提及这一点，但选择性和焦炭形成模式的变化表明，氢气可能影响催化剂上酸性位点在反应过程中的行为或转化方式。

7. 石墨化：氢气促进了更石墨化的焦炭结构的形成，这从焦炭催化剂的拉曼光谱变化中可以看出。

这些影响对过程效率和性能有重要影响。通过增加催化剂稳定性、转化率和选择性，同时减少有害焦炭在活性位点上的沉积，氢气共进料可能提高PDH过程的整体效率和寿命。然而，需要为每个催化剂系统确定最佳氢气浓度（Pt-Sn/Al2O3约为25%），以最大化这些益处。
