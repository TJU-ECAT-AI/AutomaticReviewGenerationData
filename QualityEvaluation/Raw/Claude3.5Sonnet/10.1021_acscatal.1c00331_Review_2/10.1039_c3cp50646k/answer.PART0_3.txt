[1] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles. At the start of the first cycle only cracking products are detected, but over the course of this cycle the selectivity towards propene increases. After a few cycles the addition of hydrogen in fact increases the selectivity towards propene."

[2] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, meaning it decreases the drop in conversion between cycles."

[3] "First of all, hydrogen increases the conversion of propane. Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles. This drop in conversion is unrelated to the H2 content of the feed."

[4] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

[5] "TGA, operando Raman spectroscopy and on-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements all show that H2 addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material. From the operando Raman spectra we conclude, that the addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while TGA confirms that less coke is formed in the presence of H2."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition leads to the formation of less coke overall. The coke that does form is more graphitic in nature, consisting of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites. This graphitic coke tends to cover the catalyst support rather than the active Pt sites.

2. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen improves catalyst stability by decreasing the drop in conversion between cycles. It helps keep the surface of Pt nanoparticles free of disordered coke species, which are more detrimental to catalyst performance.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Initially, hydrogen addition lowers propene selectivity and promotes cracking reactions. However, after a few cycles, it increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen alters the reaction pathways, possibly by affecting the nature of active sites or by influencing the adsorption/desorption of reactants and products.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly mentioned, the change in coke structure and reaction selectivity implies that hydrogen likely affects energy barriers for different reaction pathways.

5. Acid site conversions: The document doesn't directly address this, but the changes in coke formation patterns could potentially affect acid site accessibility and activity.

6. Graphitization: Hydrogen promotes the formation of more graphitic coke structures, which are less detrimental to catalyst performance compared to disordered coke.

These effects have significant implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to reduced coking and better stability.
2. Enhanced propene yield over multiple cycles.
3. Potential for longer operation times between regeneration cycles.
4. More efficient use of catalyst surface area, as coke preferentially forms on the support rather than active sites.

However, the optimal hydrogen concentration needs to be determined, as excessive hydrogen can negatively impact the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有显著影响，主要表现在以下几个方面：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气的添加导致总体焦炭形成量减少。形成的焦炭性质更接近石墨，由更小、更有序的石墨晶体组成。这种石墨化焦炭倾向于覆盖催化剂载体而非活性Pt位点。

2. 催化剂稳定性：氢气通过减少循环间转化率的下降来提高催化剂稳定性。它有助于保持Pt纳米颗粒表面不被无序焦炭物种覆盖，这些无序焦炭对催化剂性能更为不利。

3. 反应机理：最初，氢气的添加降低了丙烯选择性并促进了裂解反应。然而，经过几个循环后，它增加了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这表明氢气改变了反应途径，可能是通过影响活性位点的性质或影响反应物和产物的吸附/脱附。

4. 能量障碍：虽然没有明确提及，但焦炭结构和反应选择性的变化暗示氢气可能影响不同反应途径的能量障碍。

5. 酸性位点转化：文献并未直接提及这一点，但焦炭形成模式的变化可能会影响酸性位点的可及性和活性。

6. 石墨化：氢气促进了更多石墨化焦炭结构的形成，这些结构比无序焦炭对催化剂性能的影响较小。

这些效应对整体过程效率和性能有重要影响：

1. 由于焦炭减少和稳定性提高，催化剂寿命得到改善。
2. 多个循环中丙烯产率提高。
3. 再生循环之间可能有更长的操作时间。
4. 催化剂表面积利用更高效，因为焦炭优先在载体而非活性位点上形成。

然而，需要确定最佳氢气浓度，因为过量的氢气可能会对脱氢反应的平衡产生负面影响。
