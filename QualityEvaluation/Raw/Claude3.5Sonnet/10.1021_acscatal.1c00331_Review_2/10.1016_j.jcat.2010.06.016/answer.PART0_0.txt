[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25."

[2] "At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogenation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant, leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate of alkene formation."

[3] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."

[4] "The adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

Hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has several effects on the process:

1. Reaction rate: Adding hydrogen initially increases the rate of propene formation up to an optimal H2/C3H8 ratio, beyond which the rate decreases.

2. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species on the catalyst surface.

3. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding likely improves catalyst stability and lifetime.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen assists in the dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species, enhancing the overall reaction rate. However, at high concentrations, it can lead to the reformation of propane, reducing propene yield.

5. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen likely lowers the energy barrier for propene formation from surface alkyl species.

6. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen cofeeding results in less coke accumulation overall, particularly on the active metal sites of the catalyst.

7. Acid site conversions: The literature does not directly address this aspect, but hydrogen may help preserve acid sites by reducing coke formation.

8. Graphitization: While not explicitly mentioned, reduced coke formation likely results in less graphitization of deposited carbon.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

- Improved catalyst lifetime and reduced need for regeneration
- Potential for higher propene yields at optimal hydrogen concentrations
- More stable operation due to reduced coking
- Possible energy savings from lower reaction temperatures or pressures

However, careful control of the H2/C3H8 ratio is crucial to maximize benefits while avoiding excessive hydrogenation of the desired propene product.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中有以下几个影响：

1. 反应速率：添加氢气最初会增加丙烯生成速率，直到达到最佳H2/C3H8比例，超过此比例后速率会下降。

2. 积碳形成：氢气的添加通过氢化催化剂表面的积碳前体物种来减少积碳形成。

3. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

4. 反应机理：氢气协助表面烷基物种的脱氢，提高整体反应速率。但是，在高浓度下，它可能导致丙烷重新形成，从而降低丙烯产率。

5. 能量障碍：氢气的存在可能会降低表面烷基物种形成丙烯的能量障碍。

6. 积碳积累模式：氢气共进料导致整体积碳积累减少，特别是在催化剂的活性金属位点上。

7. 酸性位点转化：文献没有直接提到这一方面，但氢气可能通过减少积碳形成来帮助保护酸性位点。

8. 石墨化：虽然没有明确提及，但减少积碳形成可能会导致沉积碳的石墨化程度降低。

这些影响对过程效率和性能有重要意义：

- 改善催化剂寿命并减少再生需求
- 在最佳氢气浓度下可能获得更高的丙烯产率
- 由于积碳减少，操作更加稳定
- 可能通过降低反应温度或压力来节省能源

然而，仔细控制H2/C3H8比例至关重要，以最大化优势，同时避免过度氢化所需的丙烯产品。
