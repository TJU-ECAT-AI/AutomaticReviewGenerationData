[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25."

[2] "At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogenation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant, leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate of alkene formation."

[3] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."

[4] "The adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has several effects on the process:

1. Reaction rate: Adding hydrogen initially increases the rate of propene formation up to an optimal H2/C3H8 ratio, beyond which the rate decreases.

2. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species on the catalyst surface.

3. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding likely improves catalyst stability and lifetime.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen assists in the dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species, enhancing the overall reaction rate. However, at high concentrations, it can lead to the reformation of propane, reducing propene yield.

5. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen likely lowers the energy barrier for propene formation from surface alkyl species.

6. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen cofeeding results in less coke accumulation overall, particularly on the active metal sites of the catalyst.

7. Acid site conversions: The literature does not directly address this aspect, but hydrogen may help preserve acid sites by reducing coke formation.

8. Graphitization: While not explicitly mentioned, reduced coke formation likely results in less graphitization of deposited carbon.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

- Improved catalyst lifetime and reduced need for regeneration
- Potential for higher propene yields at optimal hydrogen concentrations
- More stable operation due to reduced coking
- Possible energy savings from lower reaction temperatures or pressures

However, careful control of the H2/C3H8 ratio is crucial to maximize benefits while avoiding excessive hydrogenation of the desired propene product.

4. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen likely lowers the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction, as evidenced by the increased rate of propene formation at moderate H2/C3H8 ratios.

5. Acid site conversions: The literature does not specifically address the effect of hydrogen on acid site conversions.

6. Graphitization: While not explicitly mentioned, the reduction in coke formation suggests that hydrogen cofeeding may also inhibit graphitization of carbon deposits.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to reduced coking.
2. Enhanced propene yield at optimal H2/C3H8 ratios.
3. Better control over the reaction by adjusting hydrogen partial pressure.
4. Potential for extended operation times between catalyst regenerations.
5. Improved overall process economics due to higher yields and longer catalyst life.

However, careful optimization of the H2/C3H8 ratio is crucial to maximize these benefits while avoiding excessive hydrogenation of the desired propene product.

[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."

[2] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation."

[3] "Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."

[4] "In all cases, the rate of alkene formation increases with increasing H2/alkane ratio and then passes through a maximum. In our studies of ethane dehydrogenation on Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O, we proposed that at low hydrogen partial pressures the increase in adsorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface contributes to the removal of the second hydrogen atom from adsorbed alkyl species, thereby accelerating the rate of alkene formation"

[5] "At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogenation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant, leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate of alkene formation."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects:

1. Catalyst activity: Initially, adding H2 increases the dehydrogenation rate by assisting in the removal of hydrogen from adsorbed alkyl species. This leads to a peak in activity at a certain H2/alkane ratio.

2. Reaction mechanisms: At low H2 partial pressures, adsorbed H atoms help remove the second hydrogen from alkyl species, accelerating alkene formation. At higher H2 pressures, hydrogenation of alkyl species becomes dominant, reforming the alkane and decreasing alkene formation.

3. Coke formation: The presence of hydrogen helps suppress coke formation on the catalyst surface.

4. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding likely improves catalyst stability over time.

5. Selectivity: Hydrogen addition has little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%.

6. Process efficiency: There is an optimal H2/alkane ratio that maximizes alkene formation. Beyond this point, excessive H2 reduces the net dehydrogenation rate, potentially decreasing overall process efficiency.

These effects suggest that careful control of hydrogen cofeeding can optimize PDH performance by balancing increased activity and reduced coking against the potential for alkene hydrogenation at higher H2 concentrations.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中有几个显著的影响：

1. 催化剂活性：最初，添加H2通过协助去除吸附烷基物种上的氢来增加脱氢速率。这导致在某个H2/烷烃比率下活性达到峰值。

2. 反应机理：在低H2分压下，吸附的H原子有助于从烷基物种中去除第二个氢，加速烯烃的形成。在较高的H2压力下，烷基物种的氢化变得占主导地位，重新形成烷烃并降低烯烃的形成。

3. 积碳形成：氢的存在有助于抑制催化剂表面的积碳形成。

4. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料可能会随时间推移提高催化剂的稳定性。

5. 选择性：氢气的添加对烯烃选择性影响很小，选择性保持在接近100%。

6. 过程效率：存在一个最佳的H2/烷烃比率，可以最大化烯烃的形成。超过这个点，过量的H2会降低净脱氢速率，可能会降低整体过程效率。

这些影响表明，仔细控制氢气共进料可以通过平衡增加的活性和减少积碳与在较高H2浓度下可能发生的烯烃氢化来优化PDH性能。

Hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has several effects:

1. It increases the rate of propene formation up to an optimal H2/C3H8 ratio.

2. It enhances the dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species, improving reaction rates.

3. It reduces coke formation by facilitating the hydrogenation of propylidyne species.

4. It improves catalyst stability by lowering deactivation rates.

These effects are due to hydrogen's ability to lower energy barriers for dehydrogenation and hydrogenate coke precursors. The presence of hydrogen alters coke accumulation patterns, likely reducing graphitization and conversion of acid sites. 

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding improves process efficiency and performance by increasing propene yield, extending catalyst lifetime, and reducing coking issues. However, there is an optimal hydrogen concentration beyond which excessive hydrogenation can reduce propene yield. Balancing these factors is crucial for optimizing the PDH process.

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition suppresses coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species. This leads to lower coke accumulation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain catalyst stability over time. However, the exact impact on long-term stability is not explicitly stated in the given text.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen addition enhances the dehydrogenation rate through H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. This mechanism involves the dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane, followed by hydrogen-assisted removal of hydrogen atoms from the adsorbed alkyl species.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly mentioned, the enhanced dehydrogenation rate with hydrogen addition suggests a lowering of energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: The text indicates that hydrogen addition reduces overall coke accumulation, but does not provide specific details on accumulation patterns.

6. Acid site conversions: The literature does not mention the effect of hydrogen cofeeding on acid site conversions.

7. Graphitization: The text does not discuss the impact of hydrogen addition on graphitization of coke deposits.

8. Process efficiency and performance: Hydrogen cofeeding improves process efficiency by increasing the dehydrogenation rate up to a certain point. However, excessive hydrogen can lead to alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net dehydrogenation rate. The selectivity towards alkenes remains high (near 100%) regardless of hydrogen addition.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH appears to enhance process performance by suppressing coke formation and increasing reaction rates, but its effects must be carefully balanced to avoid unwanted hydrogenation reactions.
