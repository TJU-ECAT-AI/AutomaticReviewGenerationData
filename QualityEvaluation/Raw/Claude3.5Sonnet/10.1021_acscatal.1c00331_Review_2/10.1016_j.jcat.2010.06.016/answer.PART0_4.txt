[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."

[2] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation."

[3] "Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."

[4] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."

[5] "Thus, the adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects several aspects:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition suppresses coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species. This leads to lower coke accumulation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain catalyst stability over time. However, the exact impact on long-term stability is not explicitly stated in the given text.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen addition enhances the dehydrogenation rate through H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. This mechanism involves the dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane, followed by hydrogen-assisted removal of hydrogen atoms from the adsorbed alkyl species.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly mentioned, the enhanced dehydrogenation rate with hydrogen addition suggests a lowering of energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: The text indicates that hydrogen addition reduces overall coke accumulation, but does not provide specific details on accumulation patterns.

6. Acid site conversions: The literature does not mention the effect of hydrogen cofeeding on acid site conversions.

7. Graphitization: The text does not discuss the impact of hydrogen addition on graphitization of coke deposits.

8. Process efficiency and performance: Hydrogen cofeeding improves process efficiency by increasing the dehydrogenation rate up to a certain point. However, excessive hydrogen can lead to alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net dehydrogenation rate. The selectivity towards alkenes remains high (near 100%) regardless of hydrogen addition.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH appears to enhance process performance by suppressing coke formation and increasing reaction rates, but its effects must be carefully balanced to avoid unwanted hydrogenation reactions.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中影响了几个方面：

1. 积碳形成：氢气的添加通过氢化积碳前体物抑制了积碳的形成。这导致丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成比乙烷脱氢更少。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料有助于维持催化剂的长期稳定性。然而，文中并未明确说明对长期稳定性的确切影响。

3. 反应机理：氢气的添加通过氢原子辅助表面烷基物种脱氢来增强脱氢速率。这种机理涉及反应物烷烃的解离吸附，随后是吸附烷基物种的氢辅助脱氢。

4. 能量障碍：虽然没有明确提及，但氢气添加后脱氢速率的提高暗示了脱氢反应能量障碍的降低。

5. 积碳累积模式：文中指出氢气添加减少了整体积碳累积，但没有提供具体的累积模式细节。

6. 酸性位点转化：文献中没有提到氢气共进料对酸性位点转化的影响。

7. 石墨化：文中没有讨论氢气添加对积碳沉积物石墨化的影响。

8. 过程效率和性能：氢气共进料通过增加脱氢速率来提高过程效率，但仅限于一定程度。然而，过量的氢气可能导致烯烃氢化，降低净脱氢速率。无论是否添加氢气，烯烃的选择性都保持很高（接近100%）。

总的来说，PDH过程中的氢气共进料似乎通过抑制积碳形成和增加反应速率来提高过程性能，但其效果必须仔细平衡以避免不必要的氢化反应。
