[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25."

[2] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."

[3] "At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogenation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant, leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate of alkene formation."

[4] "The adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species. This leads to lower coke accumulation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain catalyst stability over time.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen enhances the rate of propene formation up to a certain H2/C3H8 ratio (1.25) by facilitating hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. However, at higher hydrogen partial pressures, it can lead to the reformation of propane, decreasing the overall rate of propene formation.

4. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen likely lowers the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction, as evidenced by the increased rate of propene formation at moderate H2/C3H8 ratios.

5. Acid site conversions: The literature does not specifically address the effect of hydrogen on acid site conversions.

6. Graphitization: While not explicitly mentioned, the reduction in coke formation suggests that hydrogen cofeeding may also inhibit graphitization of carbon deposits.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to reduced coking.
2. Enhanced propene yield at optimal H2/C3H8 ratios.
3. Better control over the reaction by adjusting hydrogen partial pressure.
4. Potential for extended operation times between catalyst regenerations.
5. Improved overall process economics due to higher yields and longer catalyst life.

However, careful optimization of the H2/C3H8 ratio is crucial to maximize these benefits while avoiding excessive hydrogenation of the desired propene product.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中共进料氢气对积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个影响：

1. 积碳形成：氢气的添加通过氢化积碳前体物质来减少积碳形成。这导致丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成比乙烷脱氢少。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料有助于长期维持催化剂的稳定性。

3. 反应机理：氢气增强了丙烯的生成速率，直到特定的H2/C3H8比例(1.25)，这是通过促进表面烷基物种的氢辅助脱氢实现的。然而，在更高的氢分压下，它可能导致丙烷的重新形成，从而降低丙烯的总体生成速率。

4. 能量障碍：氢气的存在可能降低了脱氢反应的能量障碍，这从中等H2/C3H8比例下丙烯生成速率的增加可以看出。

5. 酸性位转化：文献中并未具体提到氢气对酸性位转化的影响。

6. 石墨化：虽然没有明确提及，但积碳形成的减少表明氢气共进料可能也抑制了碳沉积物的石墨化。

这些影响对工艺效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 由于积碳减少，催化剂寿命得到延长。
2. 在最佳H2/C3H8比例下，丙烯产率提高。
3. 通过调整氢分压，可以更好地控制反应。
4. 催化剂再生之间的操作时间可能延长。
5. 由于产率更高和催化剂寿命更长，整体工艺经济性得到改善。

然而，仔细优化H2/C3H8比例对于最大化这些优势同时避免过度氢化所需丙烯产物至关重要。
