          [1] "The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25."

[2] "At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogenation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant, leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate of alkene formation."

[3] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."

[4] "The adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

[5] "The addition of H2 to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."

[6] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation."

[7] "Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."

[8] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition significantly reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species. This results in lower coke accumulation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability and longevity. Catalysts like Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O exhibit lower deactivation rates compared to conventional bimetallic catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen enhances the rate of propene formation through hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species. This mechanism involves the dissociative adsorption of propane, followed by H-atom-assisted removal of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkyl species.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly stated, the enhanced dehydrogenation rate with hydrogen addition suggests a lowering of energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: The overall coke accumulation is reduced, but specific patterns are not detailed in the provided information.

6. Acid site conversions: The effect on acid site conversions is not mentioned in the given quotes.

7. Graphitization: The impact on graphitization of coke deposits is not discussed in the provided information.

The implications for process efficiency and performance are significant:

1. Increased propene formation rate up to an optimal H2/C3H8 ratio (around 1.25).
2. Improved catalyst longevity due to reduced coking and deactivation.
3. Higher overall process efficiency due to better catalyst performance.
4. Potential for extended operation times between catalyst regenerations.
5. Maintenance of high alkene selectivity (near 100%) regardless of hydrogen addition.

However, careful control of the H2/C3H8 ratio is crucial, as excessive hydrogen can lead to alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net dehydrogenation rate and overall process efficiency.

          氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 积碳形成：氢气的添加通过氢化积碳前体物显著减少了积碳形成。这导致丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳累积比乙烷脱氢少。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料提高了催化剂的稳定性和寿命。像Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O这样的催化剂比传统的双金属催化剂表现出更低的失活率。

3. 反应机理：氢气通过氢辅助表面烷基物种脱氢来增强丙烯的生成速率。这种机制涉及丙烷的解离吸附，随后是吸附烷基物种的氢原子辅助脱氢。

4. 能量障碍：虽然没有明确说明，但氢气添加后脱氢速率的提高暗示了脱氢反应能量障碍的降低。

5. 积碳累积模式：整体积碳累积减少，但在提供的信息中没有详细说明具体模式。

6. 酸性位点转化：给出的引用中没有提到对酸性位点转化的影响。

7. 石墨化：提供的信息中没有讨论对积碳沉积物石墨化的影响。

这些影响对工艺效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 在最佳H2/C3H8比率（约1.25）下，丙烯生成速率增加。
2. 由于积碳和失活减少，催化剂寿命延长。
3. 由于催化剂性能改善，整体工艺效率提高。
4. 催化剂再生之间的操作时间可能延长。
5. 无论是否添加氢气，都能保持高烯烃选择性（接近100%）。

然而，仔细控制H2/C3H8比率至关重要，因为过量的氢气可能导致烯烃氢化，降低净脱氢速率和整体工艺效率。
