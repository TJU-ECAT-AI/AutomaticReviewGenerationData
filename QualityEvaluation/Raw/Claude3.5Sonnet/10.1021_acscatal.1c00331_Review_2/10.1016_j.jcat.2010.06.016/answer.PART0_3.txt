[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25."

[2] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne"

[4] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

Hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has several effects:

1. It increases the rate of propene formation up to an optimal H2/C3H8 ratio.

2. It enhances the dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species, improving reaction rates.

3. It reduces coke formation by facilitating the hydrogenation of propylidyne species.

4. It improves catalyst stability by lowering deactivation rates.

These effects are due to hydrogen's ability to lower energy barriers for dehydrogenation and hydrogenate coke precursors. The presence of hydrogen alters coke accumulation patterns, likely reducing graphitization and conversion of acid sites. 

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding improves process efficiency and performance by increasing propene yield, extending catalyst lifetime, and reducing coking issues. However, there is an optimal hydrogen concentration beyond which excessive hydrogenation can reduce propene yield. Balancing these factors is crucial for optimizing the PDH process.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气有以下几个效果：

1. 它能提高丙烯的生成速率，直到达到最佳的H2/C3H8比例。

2. 它增强了表面烷基物种的脱氢，提高了反应速率。

3. 它通过促进丙烯基物种的氢化来减少积碳形成。

4. 它通过降低失活速率来提高催化剂的稳定性。

这些效果是由于氢气能够降低脱氢的能量障碍并氢化积碳前体物。氢气的存在改变了积碳累积模式，可能减少了石墨化和酸性位点的转化。

总的来说，添加氢气提高了过程效率和性能，增加了丙烯产量，延长了催化剂寿命，并减少了结焦问题。然而，存在一个最佳的氢气浓度，超过这个浓度过度的氢化会降低丙烯产量。平衡这些因素对于优化PDH过程至关重要。
