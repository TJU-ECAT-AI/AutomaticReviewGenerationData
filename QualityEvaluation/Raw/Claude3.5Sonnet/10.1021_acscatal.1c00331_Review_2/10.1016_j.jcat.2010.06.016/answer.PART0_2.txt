[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."

[2] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation."

[3] "Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."

[4] "In all cases, the rate of alkene formation increases with increasing H2/alkane ratio and then passes through a maximum. In our studies of ethane dehydrogenation on Pt/Mg(Al)O and PtSn/Mg(Al)O, we proposed that at low hydrogen partial pressures the increase in adsorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface contributes to the removal of the second hydrogen atom from adsorbed alkyl species, thereby accelerating the rate of alkene formation"

[5] "At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogenation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant, leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate of alkene formation."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects:

1. Catalyst activity: Initially, adding H2 increases the dehydrogenation rate by assisting in the removal of hydrogen from adsorbed alkyl species. This leads to a peak in activity at a certain H2/alkane ratio.

2. Reaction mechanisms: At low H2 partial pressures, adsorbed H atoms help remove the second hydrogen from alkyl species, accelerating alkene formation. At higher H2 pressures, hydrogenation of alkyl species becomes dominant, reforming the alkane and decreasing alkene formation.

3. Coke formation: The presence of hydrogen helps suppress coke formation on the catalyst surface.

4. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding likely improves catalyst stability over time.

5. Selectivity: Hydrogen addition has little effect on alkene selectivity, which remains near 100%.

6. Process efficiency: There is an optimal H2/alkane ratio that maximizes alkene formation. Beyond this point, excessive H2 reduces the net dehydrogenation rate, potentially decreasing overall process efficiency.

These effects suggest that careful control of hydrogen cofeeding can optimize PDH performance by balancing increased activity and reduced coking against the potential for alkene hydrogenation at higher H2 concentrations.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中有几个显著的影响：

1. 催化剂活性：最初，添加H2通过协助去除吸附烷基物种上的氢来增加脱氢速率。这导致在某个H2/烷烃比率下活性达到峰值。

2. 反应机理：在低H2分压下，吸附的H原子有助于从烷基物种中去除第二个氢，加速烯烃的形成。在较高的H2压力下，烷基物种的氢化变得占主导地位，重新形成烷烃并降低烯烃的形成。

3. 积碳形成：氢的存在有助于抑制催化剂表面的积碳形成。

4. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料可能会随时间推移提高催化剂的稳定性。

5. 选择性：氢气的添加对烯烃选择性影响很小，选择性保持在接近100%。

6. 过程效率：存在一个最佳的H2/烷烃比率，可以最大化烯烃的形成。超过这个点，过量的H2会降低净脱氢速率，可能会降低整体过程效率。

这些影响表明，仔细控制氢气共进料可以通过平衡增加的活性和减少积碳与在较高H2浓度下可能发生的烯烃氢化来优化PDH性能。
