The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The document does mention hydrogen being used in the reaction conditions, but it does not discuss its specific effects on coke formation, energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization.

The literature shows that hydrogen was cofed in the PDH process, with different H2/propane ratios being tested (0.4 and 1.0). It also indicates that the reactions were carried out at 600°C and atmospheric pressure with a 1:1 C3H8/H2 ratio in some experiments. However, the specific impacts of hydrogen cofeeding on the mentioned aspects are not discussed in the given text.

The document does provide some information on catalyst stability, as evidenced by the 12-hour test of propane conversion and propylene selectivity for the Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalyst. However, it does not explicitly link this stability to the effects of hydrogen cofeeding.

Without more detailed information from the literature, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, energy barriers, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency and performance in the PDH process.

所提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的问题。文档确实提到了在反应条件下使用氢气，但没有讨论它对积碳形成、能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体影响。

文献显示，在PDH过程中确实使用了氢气共进料，并测试了不同的H2/丙烷比例（0.4和1.0）。它还表明，在一些实验中，反应是在600°C和大气压下进行的，C3H8/H2比例为1:1。然而，给定的文本中没有讨论氢气共进料对所提及方面的具体影响。

文档确实提供了一些关于催化剂稳定性的信息，这从Ru-P/SiO2-50催化剂的12小时丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性测试中可以看出。但是，它并没有明确地将这种稳定性与氢气共进料的效果联系起来。

没有更详细的文献信息，无法就氢气共进料对PDH过程中的积碳形成、能量障碍、酸性位转化、石墨化或整体过程效率和性能的影响得出结论。
