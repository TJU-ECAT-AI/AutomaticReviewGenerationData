[1] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion"

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly affect catalyst stability and coke formation. While the literature does not provide extensive details on the specific mechanisms, it suggests that introducing H2 into the feed gas would lead to slower catalyst deactivation and a longer catalyst lifetime. This improvement in stability is likely due to H2 suppressing coke formation on the catalyst surface.

However, the addition of H2 comes with a trade-off. It would result in a penalty in the equilibrium conversion of propane to propylene. This is because H2 is a product of the dehydrogenation reaction, and its presence in the feed would shift the equilibrium towards the reactants, reducing the overall conversion according to Le Chatelier's principle.

The literature does not provide specific information on how H2 cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, it can be inferred that H2 likely helps maintain the active sites on the catalyst surface by preventing or slowing down carbon deposition, which is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH processes.

In terms of overall process efficiency and performance, the decision to cofeed H2 would depend on the specific process goals. If longer catalyst lifetimes and improved stability are priorities, H2 cofeeding could be beneficial despite the reduction in propane conversion. This could potentially lead to longer operating cycles between catalyst regenerations, reducing downtime and operational costs. However, if maximizing propylene yield is the primary goal, the trade-off with conversion would need to be carefully considered.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中可以显著影响催化剂稳定性和积碳形成。虽然文献没有提供关于具体机理的详细信息，但它表明将H2引入进料气中会导致催化剂失活速度减慢，催化剂寿命延长。这种稳定性的提高可能是由于H2抑制了催化剂表面的积碳形成。

然而，添加H2也有一个权衡。它会导致丙烷转化为丙烯的平衡转化率降低。这是因为H2是脱氢反应的产物，它在进料中的存在会使平衡向反应物方向移动，根据勒夏特列原理，降低总体转化率。

文献没有提供H2共进料如何影响能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体信息。但可以推断，H2可能通过防止或减缓碳沉积来帮助维持催化剂表面的活性位点，而碳沉积是PDH过程中催化剂失活的主要原因。

在整体工艺效率和性能方面，是否选择H2共进料将取决于具体的工艺目标。如果更长的催化剂寿命和改善的稳定性是优先考虑的因素，那么尽管丙烷转化率会降低，H2共进料可能会带来好处。这可能会导致催化剂再生之间的操作周期延长，减少停机时间和运营成本。然而，如果最大化丙烯产率是主要目标，则需要仔细考虑与转化率的权衡。
