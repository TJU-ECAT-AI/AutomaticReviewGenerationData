[1] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion"

[2] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates"

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Catalyst stability: H2 cofeeding is expected to result in slower deactivation and longer catalyst lifetime. This is likely due to the suppression of coke formation on the catalyst surface.

2. Coke formation: The presence of H2 in the feed gas can significantly reduce coke deposition on the catalyst, particularly on PtSn clusters. This reduction in coke formation is a key factor in improving catalyst stability and extending its lifetime.

3. Reaction mechanisms: While the specific reaction mechanisms are not detailed in the given information, it can be inferred that H2 cofeeding affects the balance of reactions occurring on the catalyst surface, favoring the desired dehydrogenation reaction over side reactions that lead to coke formation.

4. Energy barriers: The information provided does not directly address energy barriers, but the reduced coke formation suggests that H2 cofeeding may lower the energy barriers for desired reactions or increase barriers for coke-forming reactions.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: H2 cofeeding appears to modify coke accumulation patterns, with less coke depositing on the PtSn clusters. This suggests a more uniform distribution of coke or overall reduced coke formation across the catalyst surface.

6. Acid site conversions: The given information does not specifically address acid site conversions in relation to H2 cofeeding.

7. Graphitization: There is no direct mention of graphitization effects from H2 cofeeding in the provided quotes.

8. Process efficiency: While H2 cofeeding is expected to improve catalyst stability and lifetime, it comes with a trade-off in terms of equilibrium conversion. This suggests that while the process may become more stable and long-lasting, there might be a slight decrease in the overall yield of the desired product.

9. Overall performance: The improved catalyst stability and reduced coke formation with H2 cofeeding indicate enhanced overall performance of the PDH process, particularly in terms of catalyst longevity and reduced need for regeneration cycles.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process primarily benefits the system by reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability, which leads to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially more efficient operations. However, this comes at the cost of some reduction in equilibrium conversion, suggesting a need to balance these factors for optimal process performance.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个影响：

1. 催化剂稳定性：预计H2共进料会导致催化剂失活速度减慢，使用寿命延长。这可能是由于抑制了催化剂表面的焦炭形成。

2. 焦炭形成：进料气中存在H2可显著减少催化剂上的焦炭沉积，特别是在PtSn簇上。这种焦炭形成的减少是提高催化剂稳定性和延长其使用寿命的关键因素。

3. 反应机理：虽然给定信息中没有详细说明具体的反应机理，但可以推断H2共进料影响了催化剂表面发生的反应平衡，有利于所需的脱氢反应，而不是导致焦炭形成的副反应。

4. 能量障碍：所提供的信息没有直接涉及能量障碍，但焦炭形成减少表明H2共进料可能降低了所需反应的能量障碍或增加了形成焦炭反应的能量障碍。

5. 焦炭积累模式：H2共进料似乎改变了焦炭积累模式，PtSn簇上沉积的焦炭更少。这表明焦炭在催化剂表面分布更均匀或整体焦炭形成减少。

6. 酸性位点转化：给定信息没有具体提到H2共进料与酸性位点转化的关系。

7. 石墨化：在提供的引文中没有直接提到H2共进料对石墨化的影响。

8. 过程效率：虽然预计H2共进料会提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命，但在平衡转化方面存在权衡。这表明虽然过程可能变得更稳定和持久，但所需产品的总产量可能会略有下降。

9. 整体性能：H2共进料改善了催化剂稳定性并减少了焦炭形成，表明PDH过程的整体性能得到了提升，特别是在催化剂寿命和减少再生周期需求方面。

总之，PDH过程中的氢气共进料主要通过减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性来使系统受益，这导致催化剂寿命延长，可能使操作更加高效。然而，这是以一些平衡转化的减少为代价的，这表明需要平衡这些因素以获得最佳的过程性能。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Based on the information provided:

1. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen cofeeding is expected to result in slower deactivation and a longer catalyst lifetime. This is likely due to the suppression of coke formation on the catalyst surface.

2. Coke formation: The presence of hydrogen in the feed gas can reduce coke deposition on the catalyst. This is particularly important for maintaining the activity of small, subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters.

3. Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly stated, the suppression of coke formation suggests that hydrogen may alter the reaction pathways, potentially inhibiting side reactions that lead to coke precursors.

4. Process efficiency: There is a trade-off between improved catalyst stability and process efficiency. While hydrogen cofeeding can extend catalyst lifetime, it also results in a penalty in the equilibrium conversion of propane to propylene.

5. Bimetallic interactions: The composition and structure of bimetallic PtSn particles play a crucial role in coke suppression. Even minimal interactions between Pt and Sn can significantly reduce coke formation, especially when the active species remain in the subnanometric regime.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH can enhance catalyst stability and longevity by suppressing coke formation, but at the cost of reduced equilibrium conversion. The optimal hydrogen concentration would need to be determined based on the balance between these factors and the specific process requirements.

1. 催化剂稳定性：预计氢气共进料会导致催化剂失活速度变慢，使用寿命延长。这可能是由于抑制了催化剂表面的积碳形成。

2. 积碳形成：进料气中存在氢气可以减少催化剂上的积碳沉积。这对于维持小型亚纳米双金属PtSn团簇的活性尤为重要。

3. 反应机理：虽然没有明确说明，但积碳形成的抑制表明氢气可能改变了反应途径，可能抑制了导致积碳前体的副反应。

4. 过程效率：催化剂稳定性的提高和过程效率之间存在权衡。虽然氢气共进料可以延长催化剂寿命，但也会导致丙烷转化为丙烯的平衡转化率降低。

5. 双金属相互作用：双金属PtSn颗粒的组成和结构在抑制积碳中起着关键作用。即使Pt和Sn之间的相互作用很小，也可以显著减少积碳形成，特别是当活性物种保持在亚纳米尺度时。

总的来说，PDH中的氢气共进料可以通过抑制积碳形成来增强催化剂的稳定性和寿命，但代价是降低平衡转化率。最佳的氢气浓度需要根据这些因素之间的平衡和特定的工艺要求来确定。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly affect catalyst stability and reaction performance. While the literature does not provide extensive details on the specific mechanisms, it indicates that introducing H2 would lead to slower catalyst deactivation and extend catalyst lifetime. This suggests that hydrogen helps mitigate coke formation on the catalyst surface.

However, the introduction of H2 also comes with a trade-off. It results in a penalty in the equilibrium conversion of propane to propylene. This is likely due to the reversible nature of the dehydrogenation reaction, where excess hydrogen can promote the reverse reaction, reducing the overall propylene yield.

The literature does not provide specific information on how H2 cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the observed improvement in catalyst stability implies that hydrogen likely plays a role in suppressing coke formation or altering its structure, thereby preserving catalyst activity for longer periods.

In terms of overall process efficiency and performance, the use of hydrogen presents a balance between improved catalyst longevity and reduced conversion. Operators would need to carefully optimize hydrogen levels to maximize catalyst lifetime while maintaining acceptable propylene yields. This balance would be crucial for determining the overall economic viability and efficiency of the PDH process.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气可以显著影响催化剂的稳定性和反应性能。虽然文献没有提供具体机制的详细信息,但它表明引入H2会导致催化剂失活速度变慢,并延长催化剂寿命。这表明氢气有助于减少催化剂表面的积碳形成。

然而,引入H2也有一个权衡。它会导致丙烷转化为丙烯的平衡转化率降低。这可能是由于脱氢反应的可逆性,过量的氢气可以促进逆反应,从而降低总体丙烯产率。

文献没有提供H2共进料如何影响能量障碍、积碳积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体信息。然而,观察到的催化剂稳定性提高意味着氢气可能在抑制积碳形成或改变其结构方面发挥作用,从而使催化剂活性保持更长时间。

在整体工艺效率和性能方面,使用氢气在提高催化剂寿命和降低转化率之间取得平衡。操作人员需要仔细优化氢气水平,以最大限度地延长催化剂寿命,同时保持可接受的丙烯产率。这种平衡对于确定PDH工艺的整体经济可行性和效率至关重要。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is expected to have several effects:

1. Slower catalyst deactivation and longer catalyst lifetime, due to reduced coke formation.

2. Lower equilibrium conversion of propane, which would reduce overall yield.

3. Potential changes in reaction mechanisms and energy barriers, though the specific details are not provided in the given text.

4. Likely reduction in coke accumulation patterns and graphitization, though this is not explicitly stated.

5. Possible impacts on acid site conversions, though this is not directly addressed.

The implications for overall process efficiency and performance would be a trade-off between improved catalyst stability and reduced propane conversion. While the catalyst would last longer, the lower conversion would mean less propylene produced per pass. The optimal hydrogen cofeed amount would need to be determined based on the specific process requirements and economic factors.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly affect catalyst stability and coke formation. While the literature does not provide extensive details on the specific mechanisms, it suggests that introducing H2 into the feed gas would lead to slower catalyst deactivation and a longer catalyst lifetime. This improvement in stability is likely due to H2 suppressing coke formation on the catalyst surface.

However, the addition of H2 comes with a trade-off. It would result in a penalty in the equilibrium conversion of propane to propylene. This is because H2 is a product of the dehydrogenation reaction, and its presence in the feed would shift the equilibrium towards the reactants, reducing the overall conversion according to Le Chatelier's principle.

The literature does not provide specific information on how H2 cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, it can be inferred that H2 likely helps maintain the active sites on the catalyst surface by preventing or slowing down carbon deposition, which is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH processes.

In terms of overall process efficiency and performance, the decision to cofeed H2 would depend on the specific process goals. If longer catalyst lifetimes and improved stability are priorities, H2 cofeeding could be beneficial despite the reduction in propane conversion. This could potentially lead to longer operating cycles between catalyst regenerations, reducing downtime and operational costs. However, if maximizing propylene yield is the primary goal, the trade-off with conversion would need to be carefully considered.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中可以显著影响催化剂稳定性和积碳形成。虽然文献没有提供关于具体机理的详细信息，但它表明将H2引入进料气中会导致催化剂失活速度减慢，催化剂寿命延长。这种稳定性的提高可能是由于H2抑制了催化剂表面的积碳形成。

然而，添加H2也有一个权衡。它会导致丙烷转化为丙烯的平衡转化率降低。这是因为H2是脱氢反应的产物，它在进料中的存在会使平衡向反应物方向移动，根据勒夏特列原理，降低总体转化率。

文献没有提供H2共进料如何影响能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体信息。但可以推断，H2可能通过防止或减缓碳沉积来帮助维持催化剂表面的活性位点，而碳沉积是PDH过程中催化剂失活的主要原因。

在整体工艺效率和性能方面，是否选择H2共进料将取决于具体的工艺目标。如果更长的催化剂寿命和改善的稳定性是优先考虑的因素，那么尽管丙烷转化率会降低，H2共进料可能会带来好处。这可能会导致催化剂再生之间的操作周期延长，减少停机时间和运营成本。然而，如果最大化丙烯产率是主要目标，则需要仔细考虑与转化率的权衡。
