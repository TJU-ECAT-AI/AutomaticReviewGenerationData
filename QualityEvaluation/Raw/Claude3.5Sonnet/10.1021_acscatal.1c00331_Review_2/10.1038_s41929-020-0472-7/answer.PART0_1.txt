[1] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion"

[2] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates"

[3] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst"

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly affect coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. Based on the information provided:

1. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen cofeeding is expected to result in slower deactivation and a longer catalyst lifetime. This is likely due to the suppression of coke formation on the catalyst surface.

2. Coke formation: The presence of hydrogen in the feed gas can reduce coke deposition on the catalyst. This is particularly important for maintaining the activity of small, subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters.

3. Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly stated, the suppression of coke formation suggests that hydrogen may alter the reaction pathways, potentially inhibiting side reactions that lead to coke precursors.

4. Process efficiency: There is a trade-off between improved catalyst stability and process efficiency. While hydrogen cofeeding can extend catalyst lifetime, it also results in a penalty in the equilibrium conversion of propane to propylene.

5. Bimetallic interactions: The composition and structure of bimetallic PtSn particles play a crucial role in coke suppression. Even minimal interactions between Pt and Sn can significantly reduce coke formation, especially when the active species remain in the subnanometric regime.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH can enhance catalyst stability and longevity by suppressing coke formation, but at the cost of reduced equilibrium conversion. The optimal hydrogen concentration would need to be determined based on the balance between these factors and the specific process requirements.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中可以显著影响积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。根据所提供的信息：

1. 催化剂稳定性：预计氢气共进料会导致催化剂失活速度变慢，使用寿命延长。这可能是由于抑制了催化剂表面的积碳形成。

2. 积碳形成：进料气中存在氢气可以减少催化剂上的积碳沉积。这对于维持小型亚纳米双金属PtSn团簇的活性尤为重要。

3. 反应机理：虽然没有明确说明，但积碳形成的抑制表明氢气可能改变了反应途径，可能抑制了导致积碳前体的副反应。

4. 过程效率：催化剂稳定性的提高和过程效率之间存在权衡。虽然氢气共进料可以延长催化剂寿命，但也会导致丙烷转化为丙烯的平衡转化率降低。

5. 双金属相互作用：双金属PtSn颗粒的组成和结构在抑制积碳中起着关键作用。即使Pt和Sn之间的相互作用很小，也可以显著减少积碳形成，特别是当活性物种保持在亚纳米尺度时。

总的来说，PDH中的氢气共进料可以通过抑制积碳形成来增强催化剂的稳定性和寿命，但代价是降低平衡转化率。最佳的氢气浓度需要根据这些因素之间的平衡和特定的工艺要求来确定。
