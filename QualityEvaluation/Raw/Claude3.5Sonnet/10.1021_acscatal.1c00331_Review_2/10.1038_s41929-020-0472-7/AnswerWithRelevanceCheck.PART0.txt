          [1] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion"

[2] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates"

[3] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst"

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Catalyst stability: H2 cofeeding results in slower deactivation and longer catalyst lifetime, primarily due to reduced coke formation on the catalyst surface.

2. Coke formation: The presence of H2 in the feed gas significantly reduces coke deposition, particularly on PtSn clusters. This reduction in coke formation is key to improving catalyst stability and extending its lifetime.

3. Reaction mechanisms: While specific mechanisms are not detailed, H2 cofeeding likely alters the balance of reactions on the catalyst surface, favoring desired dehydrogenation over side reactions that lead to coke formation.

4. Energy barriers: Though not directly addressed, reduced coke formation suggests H2 cofeeding may lower energy barriers for desired reactions or increase barriers for coke-forming reactions.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: H2 cofeeding modifies coke accumulation, with less coke depositing on PtSn clusters, suggesting a more uniform distribution or overall reduced coke formation across the catalyst surface.

6. Bimetallic interactions: The composition and structure of bimetallic PtSn particles play a crucial role in coke suppression. Even minimal interactions between Pt and Sn can significantly reduce coke formation, especially when active species remain in the subnanometric regime.

7. Process efficiency: While H2 cofeeding improves catalyst stability and lifetime, it comes with a trade-off in terms of reduced equilibrium conversion. This suggests a potential decrease in the overall yield of the desired product.

8. Overall performance: The improved catalyst stability and reduced coke formation with H2 cofeeding indicate enhanced overall performance of the PDH process, particularly in terms of catalyst longevity and reduced need for regeneration cycles.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process primarily benefits the system by reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability, leading to longer catalyst lifetimes and potentially more efficient operations. However, this comes at the cost of some reduction in equilibrium conversion, suggesting a need to balance these factors for optimal process performance.

          氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个影响：

1. 催化剂稳定性：H2共进料导致催化剂失活速度减慢，使用寿命延长，主要是由于催化剂表面的焦炭形成减少。

2. 焦炭形成：进料气中存在H2可显著减少催化剂上的焦炭沉积，特别是在PtSn簇上。这种焦炭形成的减少是提高催化剂稳定性和延长其使用寿命的关键因素。

3. 反应机理：虽然没有详细说明具体的反应机理，但H2共进料可能改变了催化剂表面发生的反应平衡，有利于所需的脱氢反应，而不是导致焦炭形成的副反应。

4. 能量障碍：虽然没有直接涉及，但焦炭形成减少表明H2共进料可能降低了所需反应的能量障碍或增加了形成焦炭反应的能量障碍。

5. 焦炭积累模式：H2共进料改变了焦炭积累模式，PtSn簇上沉积的焦炭更少，表明焦炭在催化剂表面分布更均匀或整体焦炭形成减少。

6. 双金属相互作用：双金属PtSn颗粒的组成和结构在抑制焦炭中起着关键作用。即使Pt和Sn之间的相互作用很小，也可以显著减少焦炭形成，特别是当活性物种保持在亚纳米尺度时。

7. 过程效率：虽然H2共进料提高了催化剂的稳定性和寿命，但在平衡转化方面存在权衡。这表明所需产品的总产量可能会略有下降。

8. 整体性能：H2共进料改善了催化剂稳定性并减少了焦炭形成，表明PDH过程的整体性能得到了提升，特别是在催化剂寿命和减少再生周期需求方面。

总之，PDH过程中的氢气共进料主要通过减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性来使系统受益，这导致催化剂寿命延长，可能使操作更加高效。然而，这是以一些平衡转化的减少为代价的，这表明需要平衡这些因素以获得最佳的过程性能。
