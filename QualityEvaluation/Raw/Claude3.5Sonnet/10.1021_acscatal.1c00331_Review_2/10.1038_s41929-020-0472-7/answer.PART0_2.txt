Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process can significantly affect catalyst stability and reaction performance. While the literature does not provide extensive details on the specific mechanisms, it indicates that introducing H2 would lead to slower catalyst deactivation and extend catalyst lifetime. This suggests that hydrogen helps mitigate coke formation on the catalyst surface.

However, the introduction of H2 also comes with a trade-off. It results in a penalty in the equilibrium conversion of propane to propylene. This is likely due to the reversible nature of the dehydrogenation reaction, where excess hydrogen can promote the reverse reaction, reducing the overall propylene yield.

The literature does not provide specific information on how H2 cofeeding affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the observed improvement in catalyst stability implies that hydrogen likely plays a role in suppressing coke formation or altering its structure, thereby preserving catalyst activity for longer periods.

In terms of overall process efficiency and performance, the use of hydrogen presents a balance between improved catalyst longevity and reduced conversion. Operators would need to carefully optimize hydrogen levels to maximize catalyst lifetime while maintaining acceptable propylene yields. This balance would be crucial for determining the overall economic viability and efficiency of the PDH process.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气可以显著影响催化剂的稳定性和反应性能。虽然文献没有提供具体机制的详细信息,但它表明引入H2会导致催化剂失活速度变慢,并延长催化剂寿命。这表明氢气有助于减少催化剂表面的积碳形成。

然而,引入H2也有一个权衡。它会导致丙烷转化为丙烯的平衡转化率降低。这可能是由于脱氢反应的可逆性,过量的氢气可以促进逆反应,从而降低总体丙烯产率。

文献没有提供H2共进料如何影响能量障碍、积碳积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体信息。然而,观察到的催化剂稳定性提高意味着氢气可能在抑制积碳形成或改变其结构方面发挥作用,从而使催化剂活性保持更长时间。

在整体工艺效率和性能方面,使用氢气在提高催化剂寿命和降低转化率之间取得平衡。操作人员需要仔细优化氢气水平,以最大限度地延长催化剂寿命,同时保持可接受的丙烯产率。这种平衡对于确定PDH工艺的整体经济可行性和效率至关重要。
