[1] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion"

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is expected to have several effects:

1. Slower catalyst deactivation and longer catalyst lifetime, due to reduced coke formation.

2. Lower equilibrium conversion of propane, which would reduce overall yield.

3. Potential changes in reaction mechanisms and energy barriers, though the specific details are not provided in the given text.

4. Likely reduction in coke accumulation patterns and graphitization, though this is not explicitly stated.

5. Possible impacts on acid site conversions, though this is not directly addressed.

The implications for overall process efficiency and performance would be a trade-off between improved catalyst stability and reduced propane conversion. While the catalyst would last longer, the lower conversion would mean less propylene produced per pass. The optimal hydrogen cofeed amount would need to be determined based on the specific process requirements and economic factors.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中预计会产生以下几个效果：

1. 由于焦炭形成减少，催化剂失活速度变慢，使用寿命延长。

2. 丙烷的平衡转化率降低，这将减少总体产率。

3. 反应机理和能量障碍可能发生变化，尽管给定文本中没有提供具体细节。

4. 焦炭累积模式和石墨化程度可能会减少，尽管这一点并未明确说明。

5. 可能会影响酸性位点的转化，尽管这一点没有直接提及。

对整体过程效率和性能的影响将是催化剂稳定性提高和丙烷转化率降低之间的权衡。虽然催化剂会持续更长时间，但较低的转化率意味着每次通过产生的丙烯更少。最佳的氢气共进料量需要根据具体的工艺要求和经济因素来确定。
