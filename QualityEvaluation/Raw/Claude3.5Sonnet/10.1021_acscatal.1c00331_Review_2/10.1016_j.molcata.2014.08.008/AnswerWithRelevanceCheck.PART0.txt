          [1] "The feed consisted of 3 kPa C3H8, 3 kPa H2, and balance He."
          [2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

          The literature provides limited information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed gas at 3 kPa, along with 3 kPa propane and balance helium. The document notes that coke formation occurred, causing activity drops of 33% and 22% for cubic and octahedral Pt particles respectively within 3 hours. However, it does not directly relate these effects to hydrogen cofeeding. The text lacks details on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency in PDH. There is insufficient information to draw conclusions about the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, and overall process performance. More specific studies focused on hydrogen's role would be needed to properly address these aspects of the question.

          该文献对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中氢气共进料的信息提供有限。它提到进料气中包含3 kPa的氢气,同时还有3 kPa的丙烷和余量的氦气。文档指出发生了焦炭形成,导致立方体和八面体Pt颗粒的活性在3小时内分别下降了33%和22%。然而,它并未直接将这些效果与氢气共进料联系起来。文本缺乏有关氢气如何影响PDH中的能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化、石墨化或整体过程效率的详细信息。没有足够的信息来得出氢气共进料对催化剂稳定性、反应机理和整体过程性能影响的结论。要正确解决这些问题,需要进行更多专门研究氢气作用的研究。
