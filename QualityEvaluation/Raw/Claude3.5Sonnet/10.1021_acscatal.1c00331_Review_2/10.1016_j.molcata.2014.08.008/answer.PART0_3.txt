The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document only mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed at 3 kPa, along with 3 kPa of propane. It does not discuss the impacts of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More detailed studies specifically examining the role of hydrogen in PDH would be needed to address these aspects of the question.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的问题。文档仅提到在进料中包含3 kPa的氢气,以及3 kPa的丙烷。它没有讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、焦炭积累、酸性位转化、石墨化或整体工艺效率的影响。需要更详细的研究,专门检查氢气在PDH中的作用,才能解答这些问题的各个方面。
