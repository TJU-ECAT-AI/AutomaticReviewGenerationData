<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides limited information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. It only mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed gas at 3 kPa, along with 3 kPa propane and balance helium. The document does not discuss the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. There is insufficient information to draw conclusions about the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance in this propane dehydrogenation system.

文献对丙烷脱氢过程中氢气共进料的信息提供有限。它只提到进料气中包含3 kPa的氢气,同时还有3 kPa的丙烷和余量的氦气。文档没有讨论氢气共进料对积碳形成、催化剂稳定性、反应机理、能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的影响。没有足够的信息来得出氢气共进料对这个丙烷脱氢系统的整体过程效率和性能影响的结论。
