[1] "The feed consisted of 3 kPa C3H8, 3 kPa H2, and balance He."

[2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation. The text only mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed (3 kPa H2) along with propane, but does not discuss its specific impacts. It does note that coke formation occurred and led to activity drops of 33% and 22% for cubic and octahedral Pt particles respectively within 3 hours, but does not relate this directly to the hydrogen cofeeding. The document lacks details on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More information would be needed to comprehensively address the question posed.

该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面回答关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的问题。文本仅提到进料中包含氢气(3 kPa H2)和丙烷,但没有讨论其具体影响。它确实指出发生了积碳,导致立方体和八面体Pt颗粒的活性在3小时内分别下降了33%和22%,但并未直接将此与氢气共进料联系起来。文档缺乏关于氢气如何影响能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化、石墨化或整体过程效率的详细信息。需要更多信息才能全面解答所提出的问题。
