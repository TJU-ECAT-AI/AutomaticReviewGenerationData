[1] "The feed consisted of 3 kPa C3H8, 3 kPa H2, and balance He."

[2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document only mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed gas (3 kPa H2) along with propane, but does not discuss its specific impacts. It does note that coke formation occurred, causing activity drops of 33% and 22% for cubic and octahedral Pt particles respectively within 3 hours. However, the direct relationship between hydrogen cofeeding and these effects is not explained. The document lacks details on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency in PDH. More specific studies focused on hydrogen's role would be needed to properly address these aspects of the question.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的问题。文档只提到进料气中包含氢气(3 kPa H2)和丙烷,但没有讨论其具体影响。它确实指出发生了焦炭形成,导致立方体和八面体Pt颗粒的活性在3小时内分别下降了33%和22%。然而,文献并未解释氢气共进料与这些效果之间的直接关系。文档缺乏有关氢气如何影响PDH中的能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸位转化、石墨化或整体过程效率的详细信息。要正确解决这些问题,需要进行更多专门研究氢气作用的研究。
