The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document only mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed gas, but does not discuss its specific impacts on the process. To properly address this question, more detailed studies focusing on the role of hydrogen in PDH would be needed.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响这一问题。文献只提到进料气中包含了氢气,但没有讨论它对该过程的具体影响。要恰当地回答这个问题,需要更多关注氢气在PDH中作用的详细研究。
