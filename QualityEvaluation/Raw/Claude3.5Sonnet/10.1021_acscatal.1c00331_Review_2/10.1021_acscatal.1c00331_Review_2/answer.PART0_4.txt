[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke Formation: Hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation by removing coke precursors. This effect is particularly noticeable on the catalyst support, where coke accumulation decreases with increasing hydrogen pressure. However, the coke amount on the metal component remains largely unchanged.

2. Catalyst Stability: By decreasing coke formation, hydrogen increases the stability of the catalyst. This is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

3. Reaction Mechanisms: Hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation. This prevents deep reactions, which are often responsible for coke formation and unwanted by-products.

4. Acid Site Conversions: In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by converting Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites. This conversion helps reduce the rate of coking on the support.

5. Graphitization: Hydrogen partial pressure is positively correlated with coke graphitization. While this might seem counterintuitive to the overall reduction in coke formation, it implies that the coke formed under hydrogen feeding conditions is more ordered and therefore harder to remove, as it requires higher combustion temperatures.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved Catalyst Longevity: The reduction in coke formation, especially on the support, leads to extended catalyst life and fewer regeneration cycles.

2. Enhanced Selectivity: By preventing deep reactions, hydrogen cofeeding can improve the selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

3. Process Optimization Challenges: The trade-off between reduced coke formation and increased coke graphitization presents a challenge for process optimization. While less coke is formed, the coke that does form may be more difficult to remove.

4. Energy Considerations: The higher combustion temperature required for graphitic coke removal might impact the energy balance of the process during catalyst regeneration.

5. Support Material Selection: The effect of hydrogen on acid site conversion suggests that careful consideration of support materials is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in hydrogen-rich environments.

In conclusion, while hydrogen cofeeding generally improves PDH process performance by reducing coke formation and enhancing catalyst stability, it also introduces complexities that require careful process design and optimization to fully leverage its benefits.

氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有显著影响，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气通过去除焦炭前体物来减少焦炭形成速率。这种效果在催化剂载体上特别明显，随着氢气压力的增加，载体上的焦炭积累减少。然而，金属组分上的焦炭量基本保持不变。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少焦炭形成，氢气增加了催化剂的稳定性。这对于长期保持催化剂性能至关重要。

3. 反应机理：氢气在Pt表面的吸附增加了丙烯脱氢的能量壁垒。这防止了深度反应，而深度反应通常是导致焦炭形成和不需要的副产品的原因。

4. 酸性位转换：在氢气氛围中，载体的酸性通过将Lewis酸位转换为Brønsted酸位而减弱。这种转换有助于减少载体上的焦炭形成速率。

5. 石墨化：氢分压与焦炭石墨化呈正相关。虽然这似乎与总体焦炭形成减少相矛盾，但它意味着在氢气进料条件下形成的焦炭更有序，因此更难去除，因为它需要更高的燃烧温度。

这些效应对工艺效率和性能有重要影响：

1. 提高催化剂寿命：焦炭形成的减少，特别是在载体上，导致催化剂寿命延长和再生周期减少。

2. 提高选择性：通过防止深度反应，氢气共进料可以提高对目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 工艺优化挑战：焦炭形成减少与焦炭石墨化增加之间的权衡为工艺优化带来了挑战。虽然形成的焦炭较少，但形成的焦炭可能更难去除。

4. 能量考虑：石墨化焦炭去除所需的较高燃烧温度可能会影响催化剂再生过程中的能量平衡。

5. 载体材料选择：氢气对酸性位转换的影响表明，在富氢环境中优化催化剂性能需要仔细考虑载体材料。

总之，虽然氢气共进料通常通过减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性来改善PDH工艺性能，但它也带来了复杂性，需要仔细的工艺设计和优化才能充分利用其益处。
