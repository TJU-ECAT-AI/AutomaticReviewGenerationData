          [1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke Formation: Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation by removing coke precursors. This effect is particularly noticeable on the catalyst support, where coke accumulation is reduced with increasing hydrogen pressure. However, the coke amount on the metal component remains largely unchanged.

2. Catalyst Stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen increases the stability of the catalyst. This is achieved through the removal of coke precursors and the modification of support acidity.

3. Reaction Mechanisms: Hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, which prevents deep reactions that can lead to coke formation.

4. Acid Site Conversions: In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by the conversion of Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites. This conversion helps reduce the rate of coking on the support.

5. Graphitization: The graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This means that while hydrogen reduces overall coke formation, it also makes the formed coke harder to remove due to its more ordered graphitic structure.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved Catalyst Longevity: The reduced coke formation and increased catalyst stability can lead to longer catalyst life and fewer regeneration cycles, improving overall process efficiency.

2. Selectivity Enhancement: By preventing deep reactions, hydrogen cofeeding can improve the selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

3. Process Optimization Challenges: The trade-off between reduced coke formation and increased coke graphitization presents a challenge for optimizing hydrogen partial pressure in the feed.

4. Energy Considerations: While hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability, the increased graphitization of coke may require more energy-intensive regeneration processes when they become necessary.

5. Support Material Selection: The effect of hydrogen on acid site conversion suggests that careful selection of support materials could further enhance the benefits of hydrogen cofeeding.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding offers significant benefits in terms of reduced coke formation and improved catalyst stability, but it also introduces complexities that require careful process design and optimization to maximize efficiency and catalyst longevity in PDH operations.

          氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气通过去除焦炭前体物来降低焦炭形成速率。这种效果在催化剂载体上特别明显，随着氢气压力的增加，载体上的焦炭积累减少。然而，金属组分上的焦炭量基本保持不变。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少焦炭形成，氢气增加了催化剂的稳定性。这是通过去除焦炭前体物和改变载体酸性来实现的。

3. 反应机理：氢气在Pt表面的吸附增加了丙烯脱氢的能量屏障，这防止了可能导致焦炭形成的深度反应。

4. 酸性位转换：在氢气氛围中，载体的酸度通过路易斯酸位向布朗斯特酸位的转换而减弱。这种转换有助于减少载体上的焦炭形成速率。

5. 石墨化：焦炭的石墨化程度与氢气分压呈正相关。这意味着虽然氢气减少了总体焦炭形成，但也使形成的焦炭因其更有序的石墨结构而更难去除。

这些影响对工艺效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 改善催化剂寿命：焦炭形成的减少和催化剂稳定性的提高可以延长催化剂寿命，减少再生周期，从而提高整体工艺效率。

2. 选择性增强：通过防止深度反应，氢气共进料可以提高对目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 工艺优化挑战：焦炭形成减少和焦炭石墨化增加之间的权衡为优化进料中的氢气分压提出了挑战。

4. 能量考虑：虽然氢气共进料提高了催化剂稳定性，但焦炭石墨化的增加可能需要更高能耗的再生过程。

5. 载体材料选择：氢气对酸性位转换的影响表明，仔细选择载体材料可以进一步增强氢气共进料的优势。

总的来说，氢气共进料在减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性方面提供了显著的好处，但它也带来了复杂性，需要仔细的工艺设计和优化，以最大化PDH操作中的效率和催化剂寿命。
