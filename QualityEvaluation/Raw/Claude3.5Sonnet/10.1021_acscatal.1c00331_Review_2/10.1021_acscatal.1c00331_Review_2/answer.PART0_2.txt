[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke Formation: Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation by removing coke precursors. This effect is particularly notable on the catalyst support, where coke accumulation is reduced with increasing hydrogen pressure. However, the coke amount on the metal component remains largely unchanged.

2. Catalyst Stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen increases the stability of the catalyst. This is achieved through the removal of coke precursors and the modification of the support's acidity.

3. Reaction Mechanisms: Hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, which prevents deep reactions that can lead to coke formation.

4. Acid Site Conversions: In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by the conversion of Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites. This conversion helps reduce the rate of coking on the support.

5. Graphitization: The graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This means that while hydrogen reduces coke formation, it also makes the formed coke harder to remove due to its more ordered graphitic structure.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved Catalyst Lifespan: The reduction in coke formation and increased catalyst stability can lead to longer catalyst life and fewer regeneration cycles, improving overall process efficiency.

2. Selectivity vs. Activity Trade-off: While hydrogen helps prevent deep reactions and improves selectivity, it may also slightly reduce catalyst activity due to the increased energy barrier for dehydrogenation.

3. Regeneration Considerations: The increased graphitization of coke under hydrogen feeding may require higher temperatures or more frequent regeneration cycles to remove the more stable coke deposits.

4. Process Optimization: The hydrogen partial pressure needs to be carefully optimized to balance its positive effects on coke reduction and catalyst stability against its impacts on reaction kinetics and coke graphitization.

5. Support Material Selection: The effect of hydrogen on acid site conversion suggests that support material selection and preparation methods may need to be tailored to optimize performance under hydrogen cofeeding conditions.

In summary, while hydrogen cofeeding provides significant benefits in terms of reduced coke formation and improved catalyst stability, it also introduces complexities that require careful process design and optimization to maximize overall PDH process efficiency and performance.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著的影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气通过去除焦炭前体物来降低焦炭形成速率。这种效果在催化剂载体上尤为明显，随着氢气压力的增加，载体上的焦炭积累减少。然而，金属组分上的焦炭量基本保持不变。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少焦炭形成，氢气增加了催化剂的稳定性。这是通过去除焦炭前体物和改变载体酸度来实现的。

3. 反应机理：氢气在Pt表面的吸附增加了丙烯脱氢的能量屏障，这防止了可能导致焦炭形成的深度反应。

4. 酸性位转换：在氢气氛围中，载体的酸度通过路易斯酸位向布朗斯特酸位的转换而减弱。这种转换有助于减少载体上的焦炭形成速率。

5. 石墨化：焦炭的石墨化程度与氢气分压呈正相关。这意味着虽然氢气减少了焦炭形成，但也使形成的焦炭更难去除，因为其更有序的石墨结构。

这些影响对工艺效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 改善催化剂寿命：焦炭形成的减少和催化剂稳定性的提高可以延长催化剂寿命，减少再生周期，从而提高整体工艺效率。

2. 选择性与活性的权衡：虽然氢气有助于防止深度反应并改善选择性，但由于脱氢反应的能量屏障增加，它可能也会略微降低催化剂活性。

3. 再生考虑：在氢气进料条件下，焦炭增加的石墨化可能需要更高的温度或更频繁的再生周期来去除更稳定的焦炭沉积物。

4. 工艺优化：需要仔细优化氢气分压，以平衡其在减少焦炭和提高催化剂稳定性方面的积极效果与其对反应动力学和焦炭石墨化的影响。

5. 载体材料选择：氢气对酸性位转换的影响表明，可能需要根据氢气共进料条件来调整载体材料的选择和制备方法，以优化性能。

总之，虽然氢气共进料在减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性方面提供了显著的好处，但它也带来了复杂性，需要仔细的工艺设计和优化，以最大化整体PDH工艺的效率和性能。
