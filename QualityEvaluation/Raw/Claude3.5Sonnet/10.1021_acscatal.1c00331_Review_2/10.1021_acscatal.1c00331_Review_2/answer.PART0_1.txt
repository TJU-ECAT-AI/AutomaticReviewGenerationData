[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation by removing coke precursors. This effect is particularly noticeable on the catalyst support, where coke accumulation is reduced with increasing hydrogen pressure. However, the coke amount on the metal remains largely unchanged.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen increases the stability of the catalyst. This is achieved through the removal of coke precursors and the modification of support acidity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Computational simulations show that hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation. This prevents deep reactions that could lead to coke formation.

4. Acid site conversions: In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by the conversion of Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites. This conversion helps reduce the rate of coking on the support.

5. Graphitization: The degree of coke graphitization is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This means that while hydrogen reduces coke formation, it also makes the formed coke harder to remove due to its more ordered graphitic structure.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to reduced coking, especially on the support.
2. Potential for extended operation times between regeneration cycles.
3. A trade-off between reduced coke formation and increased difficulty in coke removal due to graphitization.
4. Possible need for higher temperatures during catalyst regeneration to remove the more graphitic coke.
5. Potential for optimizing hydrogen partial pressure to balance coke reduction with ease of coke removal.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding offers significant benefits in terms of reduced coking and improved catalyst stability, but careful consideration must be given to its effects on coke properties and regeneration procedures to maximize process efficiency.

氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料对积炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著的影响：

1. 积炭形成：氢气通过去除积炭前体物来降低积炭形成速率。这种效果在催化剂载体上特别明显，随着氢气压力的增加，载体上的积炭积累减少。然而，金属上的积炭量基本保持不变。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积炭形成，氢气增加了催化剂的稳定性。这是通过去除积炭前体物和改变载体酸性来实现的。

3. 反应机理：计算机模拟显示，氢气在Pt表面的吸附增加了丙烯脱氢的能量障碍。这防止了可能导致积炭形成的深度反应。

4. 酸性位转换：在氢气氛围中，载体的酸性因路易斯酸位转化为布朗斯特酸位而减弱。这种转换有助于降低载体上的积炭速率。

5. 石墨化：积炭的石墨化程度与氢气分压呈正相关。这意味着虽然氢气减少了积炭形成，但也使形成的积炭因其更有序的石墨结构而更难去除。

这些影响对过程效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 由于积炭减少，特别是在载体上，催化剂寿命得到改善。
2. 再生周期之间的操作时间可能延长。
3. 积炭形成减少和积炭去除难度增加之间存在权衡。
4. 在催化剂再生过程中可能需要更高的温度来去除更石墨化的积炭。
5. 可能需要优化氢气分压，以平衡积炭减少和积炭去除的难易程度。

总的来说，氢气共进料在减少积炭和提高催化剂稳定性方面提供了显著的好处，但必须仔细考虑其对积炭性质和再生程序的影响，以最大化过程效率。
