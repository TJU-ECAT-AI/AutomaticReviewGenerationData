[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke Formation: Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation by removing coke precursors. This effect is particularly noticeable on the catalyst support, where coke accumulation is reduced with increasing hydrogen pressure. However, the coke amount on the metal component remains largely unchanged.

2. Catalyst Stability: The reduction in coke formation leads to increased catalyst stability. By removing coke precursors, hydrogen helps maintain the catalyst's active sites and prolongs its operational life.

3. Reaction Mechanisms: Hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation. This prevents deep reactions that could lead to coke formation, effectively altering the reaction pathway.

4. Acid Site Conversions: In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the catalyst support is weakened. This occurs through the conversion of Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites, which helps reduce the rate of coking on the support.

5. Graphitization: The presence of hydrogen promotes the graphitization of coke. While this reduces the overall amount of coke, it makes the remaining coke harder to remove due to its higher combustion temperature.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved Catalyst Longevity: The reduced coke formation and increased stability lead to longer catalyst life, reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles and improving overall process efficiency.

2. Selectivity Enhancement: By preventing deep reactions, hydrogen cofeeding can improve the selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

3. Operational Challenges: While hydrogen cofeeding generally improves performance, the increased graphitization of coke presents a challenge for catalyst regeneration, potentially requiring higher temperatures or more frequent regeneration cycles.

4. Process Optimization: The balance between coke reduction and graphitization suggests an optimal hydrogen partial pressure exists for maximizing process efficiency.

5. Support Material Considerations: The effect of hydrogen on acid site conversions highlights the importance of choosing appropriate support materials that can benefit from this phenomenon.

In conclusion, while hydrogen cofeeding offers significant benefits in terms of reduced coke formation and improved catalyst stability, it also introduces complexities that require careful optimization to maximize overall process efficiency and performance in PDH operations.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气通过去除焦炭前体物来降低焦炭形成速率。这种效果在催化剂载体上尤为明显，随着氢气压力的增加，载体上的焦炭积累减少。然而，金属组分上的焦炭量基本保持不变。

2. 催化剂稳定性：焦炭形成的减少导致催化剂稳定性增加。通过去除焦炭前体物，氢气有助于维持催化剂的活性位点并延长其操作寿命。

3. 反应机理：氢气在Pt表面的吸附增加了丙烯脱氢的能量障碍。这防止了可能导致焦炭形成的深度反应，有效地改变了反应途径。

4. 酸性位转换：在氢气氛围中，催化剂载体的酸性被削弱。这是通过Lewis酸位转换为Brønsted酸位实现的，有助于减少载体上的焦炭形成速率。

5. 石墨化：氢气的存在促进了焦炭的石墨化。虽然这减少了总体焦炭量，但由于其更高的燃烧温度，使剩余焦炭更难去除。

这些效应对过程效率和性能有重要影响：

1. 提高催化剂寿命：焦炭形成减少和稳定性增加导致催化剂寿命延长，减少再生周期频率，提高整体过程效率。

2. 选择性增强：通过防止深度反应，氢气共进料可以提高对目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 操作挑战：虽然氢气共进料总体上改善了性能，但焦炭石墨化的增加给催化剂再生带来了挑战，可能需要更高的温度或更频繁的再生周期。

4. 过程优化：焦炭减少和石墨化之间的平衡表明，存在一个优化的氢气分压，可以最大化过程效率。

5. 载体材料考虑：氢气对酸性位转换的影响突出了选择适当载体材料的重要性，这些材料可以从这种现象中受益。

总之，虽然氢气共进料在减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性方面提供了显著的好处，但它也引入了复杂性，需要仔细优化以最大化PDH操作中的整体过程效率和性能。
