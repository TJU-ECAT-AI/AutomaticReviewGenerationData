[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke Formation: Hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation by removing coke precursors. This effect is particularly noticeable on the catalyst support, where coke accumulation is reduced with increasing hydrogen pressure. However, the coke amount on the metal component remains largely unchanged.

2. Catalyst Stability: The reduced coke formation leads to increased catalyst stability, as less deactivation occurs due to coke deposition.

3. Reaction Mechanisms: Hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation, which prevents deep reactions that can lead to coke formation.

4. Acid Site Conversions: In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by the conversion of Lewis acid sites to Brønsted acid sites. This conversion helps reduce the rate of coking on the support.

5. Graphitization: The graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This means that while hydrogen reduces overall coke formation, the coke that does form becomes more graphitic and harder to remove, as it requires higher temperatures for combustion.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved Catalyst Longevity: The reduced coke formation, especially on the support, leads to extended catalyst life and fewer regeneration cycles.

2. Selectivity Enhancement: By preventing deep reactions, hydrogen cofeeding can improve the selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

3. Process Optimization Challenges: The trade-off between reduced coke formation and increased graphitization of the remaining coke presents a challenge for optimizing hydrogen partial pressure in the feed.

4. Energy Considerations: While hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability, the increased graphitization of coke may require more energy-intensive regeneration processes when they become necessary.

5. Support Material Selection: The effect of hydrogen on acid site conversion suggests that careful selection of support materials could further enhance the benefits of hydrogen cofeeding.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding is a valuable tool for improving PDH process performance, but its implementation requires careful consideration of these various effects to maximize efficiency and catalyst longevity.

氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个重要影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气通过去除焦炭前体物减少焦炭形成速率。这种效果在催化剂载体上特别明显，随着氢气压力的增加，载体上的焦炭积累减少。然而，金属组分上的焦炭量基本保持不变。

2. 催化剂稳定性：焦炭形成的减少导致催化剂稳定性增加，因为由于焦炭沉积导致的失活减少。

3. 反应机理：氢气在Pt表面的吸附增加了丙烯脱氢的能垒，这防止了可能导致焦炭形成的深度反应。

4. 酸性位转换：在氢气氛围中，载体的酸性由于路易斯酸位向布朗斯特酸位的转换而减弱。这种转换有助于减少载体上的焦炭形成速率。

5. 石墨化：焦炭的石墨化与氢气分压呈正相关。这意味着虽然氢气减少了整体焦炭形成，但形成的焦炭变得更加石墨化，更难去除，因为它需要更高的温度才能燃烧。

这些效应对过程效率和性能有重要影响：

1. 提高催化剂寿命：焦炭形成的减少，特别是在载体上，导致催化剂寿命延长，再生周期减少。

2. 选择性提高：通过防止深度反应，氢气共进料可以提高对目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 过程优化挑战：焦炭形成减少和剩余焦炭石墨化增加之间的权衡，为优化进料中的氢气分压提出了挑战。

4. 能量考虑：虽然氢气共进料提高了催化剂稳定性，但焦炭石墨化的增加可能需要更高能耗的再生过程。

5. 载体材料选择：氢气对酸性位转换的影响表明，仔细选择载体材料可以进一步增强氢气共进料的优势。

总的来说，氢气共进料是提高PDH过程性能的有效工具，但其实施需要仔细考虑这些不同的影响，以最大化效率和催化剂寿命。

5. Graphitization: The degree of coke graphitization is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This means that while hydrogen reduces coke formation, it also makes the formed coke harder to remove due to its more ordered graphitic structure.

These effects have important implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to reduced coking, especially on the support.
2. Potential for extended operation times between regeneration cycles.
3. A trade-off between reduced coke formation and increased difficulty in coke removal due to graphitization.
4. Possible need for higher temperatures during catalyst regeneration to remove the more graphitic coke.
5. Potential for optimizing hydrogen partial pressure to balance coke reduction with ease of coke removal.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding offers significant benefits in terms of reduced coking and improved catalyst stability, but careful consideration must be given to its effects on coke properties and regeneration procedures to maximize process efficiency.

1. Coke Formation: Hydrogen reduces the rate of coke formation by removing coke precursors. This effect is particularly noticeable on the catalyst support, where coke accumulation decreases with increasing hydrogen pressure. However, the coke amount on the metal component remains largely unchanged.

2. Catalyst Stability: By decreasing coke formation, hydrogen increases the stability of the catalyst. This is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

3. Reaction Mechanisms: Hydrogen adsorption on the Pt surface increases the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation. This prevents deep reactions, which are often responsible for coke formation and unwanted by-products.
