Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process or its effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. The text appears to be only a title and author list for a research article about propane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported iron/phosphorus catalysts. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to answer the question about hydrogen cofeeding and its impacts on the PDH process.

给定的文献中没有包含关于在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气的信息，也没有提到它对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响。文本似乎只是一篇关于氧化铝负载的铁/磷催化剂上丙烷脱氢的研究文章的标题和作者列表。在没有获得文章全文的情况下，无法回答有关添加氢气及其对PDH过程影响的问题。
