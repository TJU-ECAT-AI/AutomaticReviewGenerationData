          [1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "It is noted here that although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact. In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

[4] "Hydrogen promotes while hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke. These results are in good agreement with the shift of Peak II in Figs. 1 and 2."

[5] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation suppression: Adding hydrogen to the feed greatly reduces overall coke formation. Higher hydrogen content leads to less coke accumulation on the catalyst.

2. Impact on acid sites: Hydrogen weakens the acidity of the support by converting Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites, which further reduces coke formation rate on the support.

3. Coke characteristics: While hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it significantly changes the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressures, the coke becomes less dense and compact. The coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation.

4. Differential effects on metal and support: Hydrogen pressure weakly affects coke formation rate on the metal but decreases the rate of coke formation on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal increases with propane pressure, while on the support, it increases with both propane and propylene pressures but decreases with hydrogen pressure.

5. Aromatic coke inhibition: Hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke, which is typically harder to remove and more detrimental to catalyst performance.

These effects have several implications for overall process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation and softening existing coke, hydrogen cofeeding can extend catalyst lifetime and maintain activity for longer periods.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The inhibition of side reactions leading to coke formation may improve selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

3. Reduced regeneration frequency: Less coke accumulation means less frequent need for catalyst regeneration, leading to improved process economics and reduced downtime.

4. Lower energy requirements: Softer, less dense coke may be easier to remove during regeneration, potentially reducing the energy required for this process.

5. Optimized process conditions: Understanding the role of hydrogen allows for better tuning of reaction conditions to balance coke formation with desired product yield.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH processes can significantly enhance catalyst performance and process efficiency by mitigating coke formation and its negative impacts. However, careful optimization is required to balance its various effects on the reaction system and overall process efficiency.

          氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有显著影响，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 抑制焦炭形成：向进料中添加氢气可大大减少总体焦炭形成。氢气含量越高，催化剂上积累的焦炭越少。

2. 对酸性位点的影响：氢气通过将Brønsted酸性位点转化为Lewis酸性位点来减弱载体的酸性，从而进一步降低载体上的焦炭形成速率。

3. 焦炭特性：虽然氢气压力对金属上的结焦速率影响不大，但显著改变了焦炭中的氢含量。在较高的氢分压下，焦炭变得不那么致密和紧实。金属上形成的焦炭可以通过加氢进一步软化。

4. 对金属和载体的差异影响：氢气压力对金属上的焦炭形成速率影响较弱，但会降低载体上的焦炭形成速率。金属上的焦炭形成速率随丙烷压力增加而增加，而在载体上，焦炭形成速率随丙烷和丙烯压力增加而增加，但随氢气压力增加而减少。

5. 抑制芳香族焦炭：氢气抑制芳香族焦炭的形成，这种焦炭通常更难去除，对催化剂性能的影响更大。

这些效应对整体工艺效率和性能有几个方面的影响：

1. 提高催化剂稳定性：通过减少焦炭形成和软化现有焦炭，氢气共进料可以延长催化剂寿命并保持更长时间的活性。

2. 提高选择性：抑制导致焦炭形成的副反应可能会提高对目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 降低再生频率：焦炭积累减少意味着催化剂再生的需求减少，从而改善工艺经济性并减少停机时间。

4. 降低能量需求：更软、密度更低的焦炭在再生过程中可能更容易去除，可能减少这一过程所需的能量。

5. 优化工艺条件：了解氢气的作用可以更好地调整反应条件，平衡焦炭形成和所需产品产率。

总的来说，在PDH工艺中共进料氢气可以通过缓解焦炭形成及其负面影响，显著提高催化剂性能和工艺效率。然而，需要仔细优化以平衡其对反应系统和整体工艺效率的各种影响。
