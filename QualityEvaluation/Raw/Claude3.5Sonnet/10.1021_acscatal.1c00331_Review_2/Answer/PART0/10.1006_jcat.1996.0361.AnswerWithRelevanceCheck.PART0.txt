          [1] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

[2] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

[3] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[4] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke precursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation"

[5] "Adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[6] "The model showed that hydrogen helps maintain the activity. However, increased propene partial pressure and higher temperature increased the deactivation."

[7] "Figure 6a demonstrates how adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[8] "Next, a model relating the propane conversion integrated over 10 h to the experimental conditions was derived (see Fig. 6c). It showed that even if the addition of hydrogen was expected to decrease the initial conversion, the conversion integrated over the whole time period increased when the high hydrogen level was used. This effect was more pronounced at the high temperature."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen is highly effective in preventing coke formation by suppressing coke precursor formation. It reduces overall coke selectivity and the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst.

2. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen helps maintain catalyst activity and reduces the deactivation rate. It is efficient in preserving catalyst performance over time, leading to improved catalyst stability and longer operational periods before regeneration is required.

3. Reaction mechanisms: While hydrogen inhibits the main dehydrogenation reaction to some extent, its coke prevention effect is more pronounced. It decreases coke selectivity because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate.

4. Energy barriers: The literature does not directly address how hydrogen affects energy barriers, but it likely increases the energy barrier for coke formation reactions, making them less favorable thermodynamically.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen prevents initial coke formation but cannot remove coke that has already formed and deposited on the catalyst. It affects the initial stages of coke formation rather than later stages of coke growth or graphitization.

6. Acid site effects: While not explicitly mentioned, hydrogen may affect acid site conversions by altering the surface chemistry of the catalyst, potentially reducing coke formation on acidic sites.

7. Graphitization: The literature does not directly discuss hydrogen's impact on graphitization. However, by suppressing coke precursor formation, hydrogen may indirectly reduce the extent of graphitization over time.

8. Process efficiency and performance: 
   - By maintaining catalyst activity and reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding improves overall process efficiency and performance of the PDH process.
   - It allows for longer catalyst lifetimes and more stable operation.
   - Despite potentially decreasing the initial conversion rate, hydrogen addition increases the overall propane conversion integrated over time, especially at higher temperatures.
   - This suggests an improvement in long-term process efficiency and performance.

Implications:
- Extended catalyst lifetime and reduced regeneration frequency
- Improved selectivity towards the desired propene product
- More stable operation over time, allowing for longer continuous operation periods
- Economic benefits from reduced downtime and catalyst replacement costs
- Need for optimization to balance coke prevention with reaction rate
- Periodic catalyst regeneration still necessary, albeit potentially less frequently

It's important to note that while hydrogen is effective at preventing coke formation, it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. This suggests that periodic regeneration or other coke removal strategies may still be necessary for long-term catalyst performance.

          氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个重要影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，在防止焦炭形成方面非常有效。它降低了总体焦炭选择性和沉积在催化剂上的焦炭量。

2. 催化剂稳定性：氢气有助于维持催化剂活性并降低失活速率。它能有效地保持催化剂长期性能，提高催化剂稳定性，在需要再生之前可以有更长的操作周期。

3. 反应机理：虽然氢气在一定程度上抑制了主要的脱氢反应，但其防止焦炭的效果更为显著。它降低了焦炭选择性，因为防止焦炭的效果大于对反应速率的抑制。

4. 能量障碍：文献没有直接讨论氢气如何影响能量障碍，但它可能会增加焦炭形成反应的能量障碍，使这些反应在热力学上不太有利。

5. 焦炭积累模式：氢气可以防止初始焦炭形成，但无法去除已经形成并沉积在催化剂上的焦炭。它影响焦炭形成的初始阶段，而不是焦炭生长或石墨化的后期阶段。

6. 酸性位点效应：虽然没有明确提及，但氢气可能通过改变催化剂的表面化学性质影响酸性位点转化，可能减少在酸性位点上的焦炭形成。

7. 石墨化：文献没有直接讨论氢气对石墨化的影响。但是，通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，氢气可能间接减少了随时间推移的石墨化程度。

8. 过程效率和性能：
   - 通过维持催化剂活性和减少焦炭形成，氢气共进料提高了PDH过程的整体效率和性能。
   - 它允许更长的催化剂寿命和更稳定的操作。
   - 尽管可能会降低初始转化率，但氢气的添加会增加长时间内的整体丙烷转化率，尤其是在较高温度下。
   - 这表明长期过程效率和性能得到了改善。

影响：
- 延长催化剂寿命和减少再生频率
- 提高对所需丙烯产品的选择性
- 随时间推移更稳定的操作，允许更长的连续操作期
- 从减少停机时间和催化剂更换成本中获得经济效益
- 需要优化以平衡焦炭防止和反应速率
- 仍然需要定期催化剂再生，尽管可能频率较低

需要注意的是，虽然氢气在防止焦炭形成方面很有效，但它无法去除已经在催化剂上形成的焦炭。这表明，对于长期催化剂性能，可能仍然需要定期再生或其他焦炭去除策略。
