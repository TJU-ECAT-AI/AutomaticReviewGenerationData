          [1] "Increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10)."
          
          [2] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."
          
          [3] "Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-determining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/SiO2, respectively (Figure S7), revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the CH activation temperature."
          
          [4] "The formation of CH4 as a result of cracking and coke side reactions at HT was significantly inhibited with the addition of Zn over PtZn/SiO2, which might signify the higher propylene selectivity and anti-coke resistance."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects several aspects:

          1. Selectivity: Increasing H2 pressures contributes to improved propylene selectivity, likely by suppressing side reactions.

          2. Coke formation and catalyst stability: The addition of H2, along with Zn, significantly inhibits the formation of methane from cracking and coking side reactions at high temperatures. This suggests enhanced resistance to coke formation and improved catalyst stability. The PtZn/SiO2 catalyst showed lower coke amounts and graphitization degrees compared to PtZn/Al2O3, indicating better resistance to coking.

          3. Reaction mechanisms and energy barriers: H2 affects the kinetics of the reaction, slightly increasing the temperature at which C-H bond cleavage begins on the PtZn catalyst compared to Pt alone. This suggests H2 may modify the energy barriers of certain reaction steps.

          4. Process efficiency: The overall implication is that hydrogen cofeeding improves process efficiency and performance by enhancing selectivity and catalyst longevity through coke suppression.

          However, the literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen impacts specific energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully address these aspects and their implications for overall process efficiency and performance.

          氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中影响了几个方面：

          1. 选择性：增加氢气压力有助于提高丙烯选择性，可能是通过抑制副反应。

          2. 焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性：氢气的添加与锌一起，在高温下显著抑制了由裂解和结焦副反应形成的甲烷。这表明对焦炭形成的抗性增强，催化剂稳定性提高。PtZn/SiO2催化剂与PtZn/Al2O3相比，显示出较低的焦炭量和石墨化程度，表明对结焦有更好的抗性。

          3. 反应机理和能量障碍：氢气影响反应动力学，使PtZn催化剂上C-H键断裂开始的温度略高于单独的Pt催化剂。这表明氢气可能修改了某些反应步骤的能量障碍。

          4. 过程效率：总体含义是氢气共进料通过提高选择性和通过抑制焦炭形成来延长催化剂寿命，从而提高了过程效率和性能。

          然而，文献没有提供关于氢气如何影响特定能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的详细信息。需要更全面的研究才能充分解决这些方面及其对整体过程效率和性能的影响。
