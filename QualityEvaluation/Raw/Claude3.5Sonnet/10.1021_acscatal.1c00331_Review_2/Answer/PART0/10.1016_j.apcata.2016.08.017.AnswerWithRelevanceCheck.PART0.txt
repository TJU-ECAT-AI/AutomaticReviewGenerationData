          "H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio)"
          
          "Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular micro-reactor under reaction conditions of 0.1 MPa, 590 C, C3H8/H2 = 1/3 (molar ratio) and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 3.0 h1."
          
          "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. The acidity of the different catalysts was examined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia experiments."
          
          "In dehydrogenation processes, side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization) are mainly catalyzed by strong acid sites. Thus, neutralization of the strong acid sites reduces the undesirable side-reactions and improves propylene selectivity"
          
          "As shown in Fig. 1, PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibited high initial reaction activities but poor propylene selectivity because of side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). It posed very poor stability, which was manifested by the quickly decreased propane conversion caused by the catalyst deactivation."
          
          "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. As shown in Fig. 1B and Table 1, propylene selectivities increased and the coke amount decreased along with the sodium ion content addition, which might be attributed to the reduction of acid sites in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2."
          
          "Thus, sodium ion additives might modify Pt distribution in the catalysts, and thus affected the coke distribution on zeolite and greatly affected the catalyst performances in propane dehydrogenation."
          
          "Generally, the surface area and acid sites of zeolite with regular pore structure are mainly provided by its inner surface. Pt metal particles disperse on both the outside and inner surface of zeolite."
          
          "The phenomena were caused by the neutralization of the stronger acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite, which prevented the Pt acid precursor (H2PtCl6) entering into the SUZ-4 channel."
          
          "Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites on SUZ-4 zeolite and enhanced the catalyst durability and propylene selectivity by suppressing the side reactions in propane dehydrogenation processes."

          The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it provides some relevant information:

          1. Hydrogen is cofed with propane at a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 1/3 in the reaction conditions.
          
          2. The study focuses on the effects of sodium ion additives on PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 zeolite for propane dehydrogenation.
          
          3. Strong acid sites on the catalyst promote undesirable side reactions like cracking, isomerization, and polymerization, which likely contribute to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.
          
          4. Neutralizing strong acid sites with sodium additives reduces side reactions, improves propylene selectivity, decreases coke formation, and enhances catalyst durability.
          
          5. The distribution of Pt particles on both the outer and inner surfaces of the zeolite support could influence catalyst performance and coke distribution.
          
          While the document doesn't explicitly discuss hydrogen's impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, or graphitization, it suggests that modifying catalyst acidity through additives can significantly influence reaction pathways, product selectivity, and catalyst stability. This implies that careful tuning of reaction conditions and catalyst properties is important for optimizing PDH process efficiency and performance. To fully understand the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on these aspects, additional research focused on hydrogen's role would be necessary.

          该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。然而，它提供了一些相关信息：

          1. 在反应条件下，氢气与丙烷以1/3的摩尔比共进料。

          2. 该研究主要关注钠离子添加剂对SUZ-4沸石负载的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的影响。

          3. 催化剂上的强酸位点会促进不良的副反应，如裂解、异构化和聚合，这些可能导致积碳形成和催化剂失活。

          4. 用钠添加剂中和强酸位点可以减少副反应，提高丙烯选择性，减少积碳形成，并提高催化剂耐久性。

          5. Pt粒子在分子筛载体的外表面和内表面的分布可能影响催化剂性能和积碳分布。

          虽然该文档没有明确讨论氢气对能量障碍、积碳累积模式或石墨化的影响，但它表明，通过添加剂调节催化剂酸性可以显著影响反应途径、产品选择性和催化剂稳定性。这意味着仔细调整反应条件和催化剂性质对于优化PDH工艺效率和性能非常重要。要充分理解氢气共进料对这些方面的具体影响，需要进行针对氢气作用的额外研究。
