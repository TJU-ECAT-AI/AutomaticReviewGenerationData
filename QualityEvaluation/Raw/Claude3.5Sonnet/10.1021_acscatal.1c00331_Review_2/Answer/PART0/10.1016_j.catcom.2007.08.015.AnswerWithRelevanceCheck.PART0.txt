          [1] "The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8 and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total flow of 150 ml/min."

          [2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

          [3] "These results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11], namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11], namely dehydrogenation reactions."

          [4] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

          [5] "Prior to the experiments the catalysts were pretreated in flowing H2 (20 ml/min) at 793 K for 4 h."

          [6] "Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles. However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%) (Fig. 2b)."

          [7] "The initial rate of coking is an order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher (0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%)."

          The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made:

          1. Hydrogen cofeeding: The study used a feed containing 13 vol.% H2 along with 8 vol.% C3H8 in helium for the PDH reaction, indicating that hydrogen was cofed during the process. The catalysts were also pretreated in flowing H2 before the experiments.

          2. Catalyst particle size effects: The research focused more on the effects of Pt particle size rather than hydrogen cofeeding. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher activity but lower selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm). The rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the total amount of coke formed were significantly higher on catalysts with smaller particles.

          3. Reaction mechanisms: Smaller Pt particles were found to be more active for C-C bond activation (cracking reactions), while larger Pt particles were more selective for C-H bond activation (dehydrogenation reactions). This suggests that particle size influences the balance between reaction pathways.

          4. Coke formation and selectivity: Coke formation was observed to act as a promoter, improving selectivity by deactivating sites active for C-C bond activation. This implies that the relationship between coke formation and catalyst performance is complex.

          5. Catalyst stability: While not directly addressing hydrogen cofeeding effects, the study showed that catalysts with larger Pt particles (21 nm) were more stable and selective towards propylene production compared to those with smaller particles (3 nm).

          The study does not discuss energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization in relation to hydrogen cofeeding or coke formation. To fully answer the question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on process efficiency and performance in PDH, additional research specifically focused on this aspect would be needed.

          该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理具体影响的全面信息。然而，可以得出一些相关观察：

          1. 氢气共进料：研究使用的进料中含有13体积%的H2和8体积%的C3H8（氦气作为平衡气）用于PDH反应，表明在过程中确实有氢气共进料。实验前，催化剂也在流动的H2中进行了预处理。

          2. 催化剂粒子尺寸影响：研究更多地关注Pt粒子尺寸的影响，而不是氢气共进料的影响。较小的Pt粒子(3 nm)显示出更高的活性但较低的选择性，相比于较大粒子(21 nm)。在小颗粒催化剂上，积碳形成速率、积碳形成选择性和形成的积碳总量都明显更高。

          3. 反应机理：发现较小的Pt粒子对C-C键活化(裂解反应)更活跃，而较大的Pt粒子对C-H键活化(脱氢反应)更具选择性。这表明粒子尺寸影响反应途径之间的平衡。

          4. 积碳形成和选择性：观察到积碳形成起到促进剂的作用，通过使活跃于C-C键活化的位点失活来提高选择性。这意味着积碳形成和催化剂性能之间的关系是复杂的。

          5. 催化剂稳定性：虽然没有直接讨论氢气共进料的影响，但研究表明，具有较大Pt粒子(21 nm)的催化剂比具有较小粒子(3 nm)的催化剂更稳定，对丙烯生产的选择性更高。

          该研究没有讨论与氢气共进料或积碳形成相关的能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化。要全面回答关于氢气共进料对PDH过程效率和性能影响的问题，需要进行专门针对这一方面的额外研究。
