          [1] "Hydrogen is normally used in those systems to prevent extensive coking."
          [2] "The function of Sn was considered to be alteration of hydrogen adsorption [6,912]."
          [3] "Inferior results were measured with hydrogen as diluent."
          [4] "The best performance was measured with catalysts that contained all three components in samples 57. A significantly higher yield of propylene was produced in steam environment."
          [5] "Coke formation is a critical measure of catalyst stability. The low coke concentration on the catalyst at the end of the run, listed in Table 2, did not change catalyst activity."
          [6] "The advantage of steam, illustrated by the values in Table 2, is substantial especially for optimized sample 7."
          [7] "The rates listed in Table 3 indicate a significant effect of Sn, in the case of steam environment. In hydrogen the effect was much smaller."
          [8] "Coke on sample 1 blocked Pt completely providing a measure for the coke tolerance developed previously [4,20]. Regeneration recovered 74% of initial intensity of Pt spectra"
          [9] "Coke blocked only about 8% of the Pt surface, negligible in comparison with sample 1. This indicates an essential coke tolerance effect of tin, observed in steam environment for the first time, whereas previous data [4,5,20] were obtained in hydrogen medium."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

          1. Coke formation: Hydrogen is normally used to prevent extensive coking. However, the study found that steam was more effective at inhibiting coke formation than hydrogen.

          2. Catalyst stability: While hydrogen helps prevent coking, which can improve catalyst stability, the research showed that catalysts performed better in a steam environment than in hydrogen. The presence of tin (Sn) provided coke tolerance in both hydrogen and steam environments, but steam maximized this effect.

          3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of hydrogen appears to reduce the effectiveness of promoters like tin. The study found that tin had a much more significant effect on reaction rates in a steam environment compared to hydrogen.

          4. Overall process efficiency and performance: The study consistently found that steam yielded superior results compared to hydrogen as a diluent. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding may actually reduce overall process efficiency and performance compared to using steam.

          5. Coke accumulation patterns: In the absence of promoters like tin, coke completely blocked platinum surfaces when hydrogen was used. With tin present, coke blockage was significantly reduced, but this effect was more pronounced in steam than in hydrogen.

          The study does not provide specific information on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, the implications of these effects suggest that while hydrogen cofeeding can help prevent coking to some extent, it may not be the optimal choice for PDH processes. Steam environments, especially when combined with optimized catalyst compositions (including promoters like tin and potassium), can provide better overall performance in terms of coke resistance, catalyst stability, and reaction efficiency.

          氢气在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个方面的影响：

          1. 焦炭形成：氢气通常用于防止大量结焦。然而，研究发现蒸汽在抑制焦炭形成方面比氢气更有效。

          2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然氢气有助于防止结焦，从而提高催化剂稳定性，但研究表明催化剂在蒸汽环境中的表现优于氢气环境。锡(Sn)的存在在氢气和蒸汽环境中都提供了抗焦性，但蒸汽最大化了这种效果。

          3. 反应机理：氢气的存在似乎降低了锡等促进剂的有效性。研究发现，在蒸汽环境中，锡对反应速率的影响比在氢气环境中更显著。

          4. 整体过程效率和性能：研究一致发现，与氢气作为稀释剂相比，蒸汽产生了更好的结果。这表明，与使用蒸汽相比，添加氢气可能实际上会降低整体过程效率和性能。

          5. 焦炭积累模式：在没有锡等促进剂的情况下，当使用氢气时，焦炭完全阻塞了铂表面。有锡存在时，焦炭阻塞显著减少，但这种效果在蒸汽中比在氢气中更明显。

          研究没有提供关于能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体信息。然而，这些影响的意义表明，虽然添加氢气在一定程度上可以帮助防止结焦，但它可能不是PDH过程的最佳选择。蒸汽环境，特别是当与优化的催化剂组成（包括锡和钾等促进剂）结合时，可以在抗焦性、催化剂稳定性和反应效率方面提供更好的整体性能。
