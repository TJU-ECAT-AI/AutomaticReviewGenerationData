Coke formation: Hydrogen is highly effective in preventing coke formation by suppressing coke precursor formation. It reduces overall coke selectivity and the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst.\n\n2. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen helps maintain catalyst activity and reduces the deactivation rate. It is efficient in preserving catalyst performance over time, leading to improved catalyst stability and longer operational periods before regeneration is required.\n\n3. Reaction mechanisms: While hydrogen inhibits the main dehydrogenation reaction to some extent, its coke prevention effect is more pronounced. It decreases coke selectivity because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate.\n\n4. Energy barriers: The literature does not directly address how hydrogen affects energy barriers, but it likely increases the energy barrier for coke formation reactions, making them less favorable thermodynamically.\n\n5. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen prevents initial coke formation but cannot remove coke that has already formed and deposited on the catalyst. It affects the initial stages of coke formation rather than later stages of coke growth or graphitization.\n\n6. Acid site effects: While not explicitly mentioned, hydrogen may affect acid site conversions by altering the surface chemistry of the catalyst, potentially reducing coke formation on acidic sites.\n\n7. Graphitization: The literature does not directly discuss hydrogen's impact on graphitization. However, by suppressing coke precursor formation, hydrogen may indirectly reduce the extent of graphitization over time.\n\n8. Process efficiency and performance: \n   - By maintaining catalyst activity and reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding improves overall process efficiency and performance of the PDH process.\n   - It allows for longer catalyst lifetimes and more stable operation.\n   - Despite potentially decreasing the initial conversion rate, hydrogen addition increases the overall propane conversion integrated over time, especially at higher temperatures.\n   - This suggests an improvement in long-term process efficiency and performance.\n\nImplications:\n- Extended catalyst lifetime and reduced regeneration frequency\n- Improved selectivity towards the desired propene product\n- More stable operation over time, allowing for longer continuous operation periods\n- Economic benefits from reduced downtime and catalyst replacement costs\n- Need for optimization to balance coke prevention with reaction rate\n- Periodic catalyst regeneration still necessary, albeit potentially less frequently\n\nIt's important to note that while hydrogen is effective at preventing coke formation, it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst.
