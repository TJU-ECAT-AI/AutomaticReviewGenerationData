[1] "The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8 and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total flow of 150 ml/min."

          [2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

          [3] "These results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11], namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11], namely dehydrogenation reactions."

          [4] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

          [5] "Prior to the experiments the catalysts were pretreated in flowing H2 (20 ml/min) at 793 K for 4 h."

          [6] "Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles. However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%) (Fig. 2b)."

          [7] "The initial rate of coking is an order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher (0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%)."

[1] "The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25."

[2] "At much higher hydrogen partial pressures, hydrogenation of the nascent alkyl species becomes more significant, leading to reformation of the alkane and a decrease in the rate of alkene formation."

[3] "Adding H2 to the feed increases the rate of alkene formation due to enhanced hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species."

[4] "The adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

[5] "The addition of H2 to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."

[6] "Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydrogenation."

[7] "Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."

[8] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

          "The TPO profile of Pt/Cu SAA is very close to that of Cu nanoparticles, verifying its excellent anti-coke capability."

          "In terms of deactivation, a first-order deactivation model is used to estimate the catalyst stability55. The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07 h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Supplementary Table 9)."

          "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke56."

          "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile. We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335 C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 C) > 10Cu (225 C)56,57."

[1] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles. At the start of the first cycle only cracking products are detected, but over the course of this cycle the selectivity towards propene increases. After a few cycles the addition of hydrogen in fact increases the selectivity towards propene."

[2] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance."

[3] "First of all, the increase in H2 partial pressure will result in more H2 adsorbing on the active sites of the catalyst, effectively reducing the concentration of coke precursors on the catalyst material. This results in less coke being deposited, as the coke formed from these precursors makes active sites permanently unavailable for the dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "When examining the effect of increasing H2 content in the feed several trends are observed. First of all, the D band becomes more prominent with respect to the G band. Furthermore, the Raman bands become narrower and the positions appear to shift to lower wavenumbers."

[5] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

[6] "From the 4th cycle onward, the yield increases as more H2 is added. This effect of H2 on the performance of the catalyst is in fact quite similar to the addition of Sn, as it increases both the propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[7] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane. Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles. This drop in conversion is unrelated to the H2 content of the feed."

[8] "TGA, operando Raman spectroscopy and on-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements all show that H2 addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material. From the operando Raman spectra we conclude, that the addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while TGA confirms that less coke is formed in the presence of H2."

[1] "Hydrogen is normally used in those systems to prevent extensive coking."
          [2] "The function of Sn was considered to be alteration of hydrogen adsorption [6,912]."
          [3] "Inferior results were measured with hydrogen as diluent."
          [4] "The best performance was measured with catalysts that contained all three components in samples 57. A significantly higher yield of propylene was produced in steam environment."
          [5] "Coke formation is a critical measure of catalyst stability. The low coke concentration on the catalyst at the end of the run, listed in Table 2, did not change catalyst activity."
          [6] "The advantage of steam, illustrated by the values in Table 2, is substantial especially for optimized sample 7."
          [7] "The rates listed in Table 3 indicate a significant effect of Sn, in the case of steam environment. In hydrogen the effect was much smaller."
          [8] "Coke on sample 1 blocked Pt completely providing a measure for the coke tolerance developed previously [4,20]. Regeneration recovered 74% of initial intensity of Pt spectra"
          [9] "Coke blocked only about 8% of the Pt surface, negligible in comparison with sample 1. This indicates an essential coke tolerance effect of tin, observed in steam environment for the first time, whereas previous data [4,5,20] were obtained in hydrogen medium."

[1] "The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate15-17."

[2] "Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al.20 and Yang et al.21 have proved that the presence of surface hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies."

[3] "However, introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process."

[4] "For PDH over Pt catalyst, Chen et al57. found the reaction order to hydrogen is -0.5, which indicates that lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage will lead to the increase of the reaction rate."

          "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt-Cu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "This effort is motivated by recent experimental work of our group, which show a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3 : 2 in the gas feed."

[4] "At higher temperature the desorption of the alkenes becomes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, which explains the desired and experimentally observed high selectivity towards alkene formation."

[5] "Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps. A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

[6] "Even at very low residence times, where the re-adsorption of alkenes is minimized, co-feeding hydrogen gas promotes the activity of the catalyst."

[7] "The barrier for the rate-determining step A2 is reduced by about 2 kcal mol1 on average, suggesting that Sn addition may enhance the rate of alkane dehydrogenation. This beneficial effect comes at the cost of a reduced selectivity since the introduction of Sn also lowers the barrier for the undesired third CH cleavage."

[8] "The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be simulated with the Pt4 model. The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."

[9] "Surprisingly, only four phases are to be expected in the given range, with a notably sharp transition from a single-atom coverage to an almost complete saturation of the tetrahedral model system."

[1] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

[2] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

[3] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[4] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke precursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation"

[5] "Adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[6] "The model showed that hydrogen helps maintain the activity. However, increased propene partial pressure and higher temperature increased the deactivation."

[7] "Figure 6a demonstrates how adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[8] "Next, a model relating the propane conversion integrated over 10 h to the experimental conditions was derived (see Fig. 6c). It showed that even if the addition of hydrogen was expected to decrease the initial conversion, the conversion integrated over the whole time period increased when the high hydrogen level was used. This effect was more pronounced at the high temperature."

[1] "Increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10)."
          
          [2] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."
          
          [3] "Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-determining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/SiO2, respectively (Figure S7), revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the CH activation temperature."
          
          [4] "The formation of CH4 as a result of cracking and coke side reactions at HT was significantly inhibited with the addition of Zn over PtZn/SiO2, which might signify the higher propylene selectivity and anti-coke resistance."

[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

[1] "Measurements of catalyst activity and selectivity were carried out at 873 K, using 0.025 g of catalyst and a feed consisting of 20% ethane or propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance He flowing at 60 cm3/min"

[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[3] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[4] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

"It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

          "However, under realistic experimental conditions, H atoms are coadsorbed with propylene, which can weaken the chemisorption of propylene and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene."

[1] "The feed consisted of 3 kPa C3H8, 3 kPa H2, and balance He."
          [2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

"Cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."
          
          "We also found that both hydrogen and ethene compete for the same binding site, leading to enhanced ethene desorption, which is in good agreement with the experimental practice of cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."
          
          "As described in previous computational and experimental work, the key to improving dehydrogenation selectivity is loosening the interaction of the ethene with the catalyst surface, permitting its desorption prior to undergoing further reaction via dehydrogenation."
          
          "Experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."
          
          "This predicted selectivity difference is in good agreement with experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."

[1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "It is noted here that although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact. In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

[4] "Hydrogen promotes while hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke. These results are in good agreement with the shift of Peak II in Figs. 1 and 2."

[5] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

[1] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion"

[2] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates"

[3] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst"

"H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio)"
          
          "Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular micro-reactor under reaction conditions of 0.1 MPa, 590 C, C3H8/H2 = 1/3 (molar ratio) and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 3.0 h1."
          
          "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. The acidity of the different catalysts was examined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia experiments."
          
          "In dehydrogenation processes, side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization) are mainly catalyzed by strong acid sites. Thus, neutralization of the strong acid sites reduces the undesirable side-reactions and improves propylene selectivity"
          
          "As shown in Fig. 1, PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibited high initial reaction activities but poor propylene selectivity because of side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). It posed very poor stability, which was manifested by the quickly decreased propane conversion caused by the catalyst deactivation."
          
          "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. As shown in Fig. 1B and Table 1, propylene selectivities increased and the coke amount decreased along with the sodium ion content addition, which might be attributed to the reduction of acid sites in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2."
          
          "Thus, sodium ion additives might modify Pt distribution in the catalysts, and thus affected the coke distribution on zeolite and greatly affected the catalyst performances in propane dehydrogenation."
          
          "Generally, the surface area and acid sites of zeolite with regular pore structure are mainly provided by its inner surface. Pt metal particles disperse on both the outside and inner surface of zeolite."

          "Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites on SUZ-4 zeolite and enhanced the catalyst durability and propylene selectivity by suppressing the side reactions in propane dehydrogenation processes."

In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

[6] "From the 4th cycle onward, the yield increases as more H2 is added. This effect of H2 on the performance of the catalyst is in fact quite similar to the addition of Sn, as it increases both the propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[7] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane. Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles. This drop in conversion is unrelated to the H2 content of the feed."

[8] "TGA, operando Raman spectroscopy and on-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements all show that H2 addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material. From the operando Raman spectra we conclude, that the addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while TGA confirms that less coke is formed in the presence of H2."

[1] "Hydrogen is normally used in those systems to prevent extensive coking."
          [2] "The function of Sn was considered to be alteration of hydrogen adsorption [6,912]."
          [3] "Inferior results were measured with hydrogen as diluent."
          [4] "The best performance was measured with catalysts that contained all three components in samples 57. A significantly higher yield of propylene was produced in steam environment."
          [5] "Coke formation is a critical measure of catalyst stability. The low coke concentration on the catalyst at the end of the run, listed in Table 2, did not change catalyst activity."
          [6] "The advantage of steam, illustrated by the values in Table 2, is substantial especially for optimized sample 7."
          [7] "The rates listed in Table 3 indicate a significant effect of Sn, in the case of steam environment. In hydrogen the effect was much smaller."
          [8] "Coke on sample 1 blocked Pt completely providing a measure for the coke tolerance developed previously [4,20]. Regeneration recovered 74% of initial intensity of Pt spectra"
          [9] "Coke blocked only about 8% of the Pt surface, negligible in comparison with sample 1. This indicates an essential coke tolerance effect of tin, observed in steam environment for the first time, whereas previous data [4,5,20] were obtained in hydrogen medium."

[1] "The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate15-17."

[2] "Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al.20 and Yang et al.21 have proved that the presence of surface hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies."

[3] "However, introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process."

[4] "For PDH over Pt catalyst, Chen et al57. found the reaction order to hydrogen is -0.5, which indicates that lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage will lead to the increase of the reaction rate."

"The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min1 by nitrogen."
          
          "The premixed reactant mixture with fixed compositions of propane, hydrogen, and nitrogen was introduced into the reactor using mass flow controllers"
          
          "The hydrogen uptake as well as the metal dispersion."
          
          "The weight loss at 150 C can be attributed to the combustion of the adsorbed H atoms on catalysts."
          
          "The addition of promoters such as Sn,2,7,12,14 La,11,15 Ga16 and Zn17 species has been reported to be effective."
          
          "The PtCu interaction inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture."
          
          "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt-Cu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "This effort is motivated by recent experimental work of our group, which show a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3 : 2 in the gas feed."

[4] "At higher temperature the desorption of the alkenes becomes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, which explains the desired and experimentally observed high selectivity towards alkene formation."

[5] "Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps. A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

[6] "Even at very low residence times, where the re-adsorption of alkenes is minimized, co-feeding hydrogen gas promotes the activity of the catalyst."

[7] "The barrier for the rate-determining step A2 is reduced by about 2 kcal mol1 on average, suggesting that Sn addition may enhance the rate of alkane dehydrogenation. This beneficial effect comes at the cost of a reduced selectivity since the introduction of Sn also lowers the barrier for the undesired third CH cleavage."

[8] "The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be simulated with the Pt4 model. The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."

[9] "Surprisingly, only four phases are to be expected in the given range, with a notably sharp transition from a single-atom coverage to an almost complete saturation of the tetrahedral model system."

[1] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

[2] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

[3] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[4] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke precursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation"

[5] "Adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[6] "The model showed that hydrogen helps maintain the activity. However, increased propene partial pressure and higher temperature increased the deactivation."

[7] "Figure 6a demonstrates how adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[8] "Next, a model relating the propane conversion integrated over 10 h to the experimental conditions was derived (see Fig. 6c). It showed that even if the addition of hydrogen was expected to decrease the initial conversion, the conversion integrated over the whole time period increased when the high hydrogen level was used. This effect was more pronounced at the high temperature."

[1] "Increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10)."
          
          [2] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."
          
          [3] "Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-determining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/SiO2, respectively (Figure S7), revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the CH activation temperature."
          
          [4] "The formation of CH4 as a result of cracking and coke side reactions at HT was significantly inhibited with the addition of Zn over PtZn/SiO2, which might signify the higher propylene selectivity and anti-coke resistance."

[1] "Propane is usually cofed with hydrogen in the industrial PDH process. It is suggested that hydrogen decreases the rate of coke formation and increases the stability of the catalyst by removing the precursor of coke."

[2] "The computational simulations verified this explanation that the energy barrier of dehydrogenation of propylene is increased when H adsorbs on the Pt surface, which prevents deep reaction."

[3] "For a conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the reduced rate of coke formation is mainly ascribed to less coke accumulation on the support in hydrogen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 4a. The coke amount on metal is almost unchanged, but the coke amount on the support is decreased with increasing pressure of hydrogen."

[4] "In the hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by conversion from Lewis acid site to Brnsted acid sites, which is helpful to reduce the rate of coking on the support."

[5] "Additionally, the graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. This implied that it is harder to remove coke under hydrogen feeding because the highly ordered graphitic coke is combusted at higher temperature."

[1] "Figure S6. Conversion vs selectivity at 600 oC and atmospheric pressure with 0.4 (A) and 1.0 (B) H2/propane ratios."

[2] "Table S1. Catalytic conditions of C3H8 dehydrogenation at  25% propane conversion and corresponding reaction rate.a [...] performing at 600 oC with 2.5% C3H8 and 2.5% H2 at a total flow of 100 mL/min."

[3] "Figure S7.

[4] "Figure S8. Propane conversion and propylene selectivity during 12 h over Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalyst (T = 600 oC, atmospheric pressure, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, with balance N2 for a total flow rate of 100 mL/min)."

[1] "Measurements of catalyst activity and selectivity were carried out at 873 K, using 0.025 g of catalyst and a feed consisting of 20% ethane or propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance He flowing at 60 cm3/min"

[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[3] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[4] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

"It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

          "However, under realistic experimental conditions, H atoms are coadsorbed with propylene, which can weaken the chemisorption of propylene and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene."

[1] "The feed consisted of 3 kPa C3H8, 3 kPa H2, and balance He."
          [2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

"Cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."
          
          "We also found that both hydrogen and ethene compete for the same binding site, leading to enhanced ethene desorption, which is in good agreement with the experimental practice of cofeeding hydrogen during alkane dehydrogenation experiments to reduce coke formation."
          
          "As described in previous computational and experimental work, the key to improving dehydrogenation selectivity is loosening the interaction of the ethene with the catalyst surface, permitting its desorption prior to undergoing further reaction via dehydrogenation."
          
          "Experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."
          
          "This predicted selectivity difference is in good agreement with experimentally observed trends of lower coke formation with increasing Sn content."

[1] "Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate."

[3] "It is noted here that although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact. In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation"

[4] "Hydrogen promotes while hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke. These results are in good agreement with the shift of Peak II in Figs. 1 and 2."

[5] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure."

[1] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests. Slower deactivation and a longer lifetime would be expected if H2 was introduced, although with a penalty in the equilibrium conversion"

[2] "The extended lifetimes of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-12h and K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h samples could be associated with much less deposition of coke on the PtSn clusters, leading to lower deactivation rates"

[3] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst"

"H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio)"
          
          "Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular micro-reactor under reaction conditions of 0.1 MPa, 590 C, C3H8/H2 = 1/3 (molar ratio) and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 3.0 h1."
          
          "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. The acidity of the different catalysts was examined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia experiments."
          
          "In dehydrogenation processes, side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization) are mainly catalyzed by strong acid sites. Thus, neutralization of the strong acid sites reduces the undesirable side-reactions and improves propylene selectivity"
          
          "As shown in Fig. 1, PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibited high initial reaction activities but poor propylene selectivity because of side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). It posed very poor stability, which was manifested by the quickly decreased propane conversion caused by the catalyst deactivation."
          
          "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. As shown in Fig. 1B and Table 1, propylene selectivities increased and the coke amount decreased along with the sodium ion content addition, which might be attributed to the reduction of acid sites in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2."
          
          "Thus, sodium ion additives might modify Pt distribution in the catalysts, and thus affected the coke distribution on zeolite and greatly affected the catalyst performances in propane dehydrogenation."
          
          "Generally, the surface area and acid sites of zeolite with regular pore structure are mainly provided by its inner surface. Pt metal particles disperse on both the outside and inner surface of zeolite."
          
          "The phenomena were caused by the neutralization of the stronger acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite, which prevented the Pt acid precursor (H2PtCl6) entering into the SUZ-4 channel."
          
          "Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites on SUZ-4 zeolite and enhanced the catalyst durability and propylene selectivity by suppressing the side reactions in propane dehydrogenation processes."
