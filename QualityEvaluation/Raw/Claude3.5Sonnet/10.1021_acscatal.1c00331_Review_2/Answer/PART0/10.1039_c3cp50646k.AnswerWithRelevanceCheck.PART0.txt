          [1] "The addition of hydrogen lowers the propene selectivity during the first cycles. At the start of the first cycle only cracking products are detected, but over the course of this cycle the selectivity towards propene increases. After a few cycles the addition of hydrogen in fact increases the selectivity towards propene."

[2] "The addition of H2 increases catalyst stability, conversion and selectivity on the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, with a propane concentration of 75% providing the optimal performance."

[3] "First of all, the increase in H2 partial pressure will result in more H2 adsorbing on the active sites of the catalyst, effectively reducing the concentration of coke precursors on the catalyst material. This results in less coke being deposited, as the coke formed from these precursors makes active sites permanently unavailable for the dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "When examining the effect of increasing H2 content in the feed several trends are observed. First of all, the D band becomes more prominent with respect to the G band. Furthermore, the Raman bands become narrower and the positions appear to shift to lower wavenumbers."

[5] "We propose that in the presence of high concentrations of H2, more graphitic coke is formed that mainly covers the catalyst support. In the absence of H2, more disordered coke is formed, that is also present on the supported Pt nanoparticles. H2 assists in keeping the surface of the Pt free of these disordered coke species."

[6] "From the 4th cycle onward, the yield increases as more H2 is added. This effect of H2 on the performance of the catalyst is in fact quite similar to the addition of Sn, as it increases both the propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[7] "First of all, the presence of hydrogen increases the conversion of propane. Secondly, the catalyst deactivates and conversion drops both within a dehydrogenation cycle and between dehydrogenation cycles. This drop in conversion is unrelated to the H2 content of the feed."

[8] "TGA, operando Raman spectroscopy and on-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements all show that H2 addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material. From the operando Raman spectra we conclude, that the addition of hydrogen leads to smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while TGA confirms that less coke is formed in the presence of H2."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several significant ways:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen addition leads to less overall coke formation. The coke that does form is more graphitic in nature, consisting of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites. This graphitic coke tends to cover mainly the catalyst support rather than the active Pt sites.

2. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen improves catalyst stability by decreasing the drop in conversion between cycles. It helps keep the surface of Pt nanoparticles free of disordered coke species, which are more detrimental to catalyst performance.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Initially, hydrogen addition lowers propene selectivity and promotes cracking reactions. However, after a few cycles, it increases both propane conversion and propene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen alters the reaction pathways, possibly by modifying the nature of active sites or by influencing the adsorption/desorption of reactants and products.

4. Energy barriers: While not explicitly mentioned, the changes in selectivity and conversion imply that hydrogen affects the energy barriers of different reaction pathways, favoring dehydrogenation over cracking reactions after initial cycles.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen changes the pattern of coke accumulation, promoting the formation of graphitic coke on the catalyst support rather than disordered coke on active Pt sites.

6. Acid site conversions: The literature doesn't directly address acid site conversions, but the changes in selectivity and coke formation patterns suggest that hydrogen may affect how acid sites on the catalyst behave or are converted during the reaction.

7. Graphitization: Hydrogen promotes the formation of more graphitic coke structures, as evidenced by changes in the Raman spectra of the coked catalysts.

These effects have significant implications for process efficiency and performance:

1. Improved catalyst longevity due to increased stability and reduced coking on active sites.
2. Higher propene yields, especially after the initial few cycles.
3. Potential for longer operation times between regeneration cycles.
4. More efficient use of the catalyst surface, as hydrogen helps keep active Pt sites free from coke.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding appears to be a promising strategy for improving the efficiency and performance of the PDH process, particularly over extended periods of operation. However, the optimal hydrogen concentration (around 25% for Pt-Sn/Al2O3) needs to be determined for each catalyst system to maximize these benefits.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中添加氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气的添加导致总体焦炭形成量减少。形成的焦炭性质更趋向于石墨化，由更小、更有序的石墨晶体组成。这种石墨化焦炭倾向于主要覆盖在催化剂载体上，而不是活性Pt位点上。

2. 催化剂稳定性：氢气通过减少循环间转化率的下降来提高催化剂稳定性。它有助于保持Pt纳米颗粒表面不被无序焦炭物种覆盖，这些无序焦炭对催化剂性能更为不利。

3. 反应机理：最初，氢气的添加降低了丙烯选择性并促进了裂解反应。然而，经过几个循环后，它增加了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这表明氢气改变了反应途径，可能是通过修改活性位点的性质或影响反应物和产物的吸附/脱附。

4. 能量障碍：虽然没有明确提及，但选择性和转化率的变化暗示氢气影响了不同反应途径的能量障碍，在初始循环后有利于脱氢反应而不是裂解反应。

5. 焦炭积累模式：氢气改变了焦炭积累的模式，促进在催化剂载体上形成石墨化焦炭，而不是在活性Pt位点上形成无序焦炭。

6. 酸性位点转化：文献没有直接提到酸性位点转化，但选择性和焦炭形成模式的变化表明，氢气可能影响催化剂上酸性位点在反应过程中的行为或转化方式。

7. 石墨化：氢气促进了更多石墨化焦炭结构的形成，这从焦炭催化剂的拉曼光谱变化中可以看出。

这些影响对过程效率和性能有重要意义：

1. 由于稳定性提高和活性位点上焦炭减少，催化剂寿命得到改善。
2. 特别是在最初几个循环后，丙烯产率更高。
3. 再生循环之间可能有更长的操作时间。
4. 催化剂表面利用更高效，因为氢气有助于保持活性Pt位点不被焦炭覆盖。

总的来说，氢气共进料似乎是一种有前景的策略，可以提高PDH过程的效率和性能，特别是在长期操作中。然而，需要为每个催化剂系统确定最佳氢气浓度（Pt-Sn/Al2O3约为25%），以最大化这些益处。
