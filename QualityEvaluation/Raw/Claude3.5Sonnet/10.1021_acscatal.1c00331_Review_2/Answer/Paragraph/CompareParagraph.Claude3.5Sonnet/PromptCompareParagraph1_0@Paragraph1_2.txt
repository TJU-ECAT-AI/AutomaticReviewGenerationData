Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. This comprehensive review synthesizes findings from multiple studies to elucidate the complex interplay between hydrogen and the PDH reaction system.

Coke Formation:
Hydrogen cofeeding substantially reduces coke formation on PDH catalysts [10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8]. The extent of coke suppression is directly related to hydrogen partial pressure, with higher hydrogen content leading to less coke accumulation [10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8]. This reduction occurs primarily through the hydrogenation of coke precursor species [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016]. Interestingly, while hydrogen reduces overall coke formation, it also promotes the formation of more ordered, graphitic coke structures [10.1039/c3cp50646k]. This graphitic coke tends to accumulate mainly on the catalyst support rather than on active metal sites [10.1039/c3cp50646k].

Catalyst Stability:
By mitigating coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding significantly enhances catalyst stability and longevity [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016]. Catalysts exposed to hydrogen-rich feeds exhibit slower deactivation rates and extended lifetimes [10.1038/s41929-020-0472-7]. This improved stability is particularly pronounced for certain catalyst formulations, such as Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, which show lower deactivation rates compared to conventional bimetallic catalysts [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016].

Reaction Mechanisms:
Hydrogen cofeeding alters reaction pathways in several ways. It enhances the rate of propene formation through hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016]. This mechanism involves the dissociative adsorption of propane, followed by H-atom-assisted removal of hydrogen from the adsorbed alkyl species. However, excessive hydrogen can lead to the hydrogenation of nascent alkenes, reducing overall yield [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016].

Energy Barriers:
The presence of hydrogen increases the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, which helps prevent over-dehydrogenation and subsequent coke formation [10.1039/c5cy00230c]. This increase in energy barriers is more pronounced for the undesired third C-H cleavage step compared to the initial dehydrogenation steps, thereby improving selectivity towards propene [10.1039/c3cp53796j].

Acid Site Conversions:
Hydrogen cofeeding affects the acidity of catalyst supports by converting Br√∏nsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites [10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8]. This conversion reduces the rate of coking on the support and alters the catalyst's selectivity profile.

Graphitization:
While hydrogen reduces overall coke formation, it promotes the formation of more graphitic coke structures [10.1039/c3cp50646k]. The degree of graphitization increases with hydrogen partial pressure, resulting in coke that is harder to remove during regeneration [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_2].

Process Efficiency and Performance:
The effects of hydrogen cofeeding on PDH process efficiency are multifaceted. While it improves catalyst stability and reduces coking, potentially allowing for longer operation times between regenerations, it also comes with trade-offs. Higher hydrogen partial pressures can decrease equilibrium conversion and increase energy requirements for downstream separation processes [10.1039/c5cy00230c]. However, the overall propane conversion integrated over time can increase with hydrogen cofeeding, especially at higher temperatures [10.1006/jcat.1996.0361].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH process reveal a complex system with numerous interacting factors. While hydrogen generally improves catalyst stability and reduces coking, its impact on reaction kinetics, selectivity, and overall process efficiency depends on careful optimization of operating conditions.

Future research directions could focus on:
1. Developing advanced catalyst formulations that synergize with hydrogen cofeeding to further enhance stability and selectivity.
2. Exploring the use of membrane reactors or other innovative reactor designs that could optimize hydrogen distribution and utilization within the reaction system.
3. Investigating the potential of using renewable hydrogen sources for cofeeding, aligning PDH processes with sustainability goals.
4. Conducting detailed mechanistic studies to better understand the molecular-level interactions between hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and catalyst surfaces under realistic PDH conditions.
5. Developing predictive models that incorporate the multiple effects of hydrogen cofeeding to optimize process conditions and catalyst design simultaneously.

These research avenues could lead to more efficient, stable, and selective PDH processes, potentially revolutionizing propylene production in the petrochemical industry.

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process significantly affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. This review will analyze these effects and their implications for process efficiency and performance.

1. Coke Formation:
Hydrogen cofeeding substantially reduces coke formation on catalysts. The addition of hydrogen to the feed suppresses coke precursor formation and decreases overall coke selectivity [10.1006/jcat.1996.0361]. At higher hydrogen partial pressures, the total amount of coke formed is significantly reduced [10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8]. This effect is particularly noticeable on the catalyst support, while the coke amount on the metal component remains relatively unchanged [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_2].

2. Catalyst Stability:
By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst stability and longevity. Catalysts like Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O exhibit lower deactivation rates compared to conventional bimetallic catalysts when hydrogen is cofed [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016]. The presence of hydrogen helps maintain catalyst activity over time, leading to improved stability and longer operational periods before regeneration is required [10.1006/jcat.1996.0361].

3. Reaction Mechanisms:
Hydrogen affects the reaction mechanisms in several ways:
a) It enhances the rate of propene formation through hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of surface alkyl species [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016].
b) The presence of adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface raises the energy barrier for the third (undesired) C-H cleavage step more significantly than for the first two steps, enhancing selectivity towards alkene formation [10.1039/c3cp53796j].
c) Hydrogen promotes alkene desorption by weakening its chemisorption on the catalyst surface, which helps prevent over-dehydrogenation and coke precursor formation [10.1039/c0cp00341g].

4. Energy Barriers:
While not always explicitly stated, the enhanced dehydrogenation rate with hydrogen addition suggests a lowering of energy barriers for the dehydrogenation reaction [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016]. However, hydrogen cofeeding also increases activation energies for certain steps in the reaction mechanism, which can improve selectivity but slightly reduce overall activity [10.1039/c5cy00230c].

5. Coke Accumulation Patterns:
Hydrogen changes the pattern of coke accumulation, promoting the formation of graphitic coke on the catalyst support rather than disordered coke on active metal sites [10.1039/c3cp50646k]. The coke formed under hydrogen cofeeding conditions is less dense and compact, and can be further softened through hydrogenation [10.1007/s11244-011-9708-8].

6. Acid Site Conversions:
In a hydrogen atmosphere, the acidity of the support is weakened by the conversion of Lewis acid sites to Br√∏nsted acid sites. This conversion helps reduce the rate of coking on the support [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_2].

7. Graphitization:
The graphitization of coke is positively correlated with hydrogen partial pressure. While this reduces overall coke formation, it also makes the formed coke harder to remove due to its more ordered graphitic structure [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_2].

Implications for Process Efficiency and Performance:
1. Improved catalyst longevity due to increased stability and reduced coking on active sites.
2. Higher propene yields, especially after initial cycles.
3. Potential for longer operation times between regeneration cycles.
4. More efficient use of the catalyst surface, as hydrogen helps keep active metal sites free from coke.
5. Enhanced selectivity towards the desired propylene product.
6. Reduced need for frequent catalyst regeneration, leading to improved process economics and reduced downtime.

However, there are some trade-offs to consider:
1. Excessive hydrogen can lead to alkene hydrogenation, reducing the net dehydrogenation rate [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.016].
2. Hydrogen cofeeding may decrease equilibrium conversion of propane and increase compression energy consumption for downstream separation processes [10.1039/c5cy00230c].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the PDH process reveal a complex interplay between coke suppression, catalyst stability, and reaction selectivity. While hydrogen cofeeding offers significant benefits in terms of reduced coke formation and improved catalyst longevity, it also introduces challenges that require careful process optimization.

Future research directions may include:
1. Development of advanced catalyst designs that can maximize the benefits of hydrogen cofeeding while minimizing its drawbacks, such as reduced equilibrium conversion.
2. Investigation of synergistic effects between hydrogen cofeeding and other process modifications, such as the use of membrane reactors or novel catalyst support materials.
3. Exploration of pulsed or cyclic hydrogen feeding strategies to optimize the balance between coke suppression and reaction rate.
4. In-depth studies on the molecular-level interactions between hydrogen, propane, and catalyst surfaces to further elucidate the mechanisms of coke suppression and selectivity enhancement.
5. Development of predictive models that can guide the optimization of hydrogen partial pressures for different catalyst compositions and reaction conditions.
6. Investigation of alternative hydrogen sources or in-situ hydrogen generation methods to improve the overall energy efficiency of the PDH process with hydrogen cofeeding.

These research avenues could lead to more efficient and sustainable PDH processes, potentially expanding the applicability of this important industrial reaction in the production of high-value chemicals.
