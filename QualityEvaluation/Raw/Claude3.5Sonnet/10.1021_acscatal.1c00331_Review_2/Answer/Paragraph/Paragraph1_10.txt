The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process is a crucial industrial method for producing propylene, but it faces challenges related to coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Hydrogen cofeeding has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate these issues and enhance overall process efficiency. The addition of hydrogen during PDH significantly impacts coke formation by suppressing carbon deposition on catalyst surfaces through various mechanisms, including hydrogenation of coke precursors and modification of reaction pathways. This, in turn, leads to improved catalyst stability and longer operational lifetimes. Furthermore, hydrogen cofeeding influences reaction dynamics by altering the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction and affecting the distribution of intermediates and byproducts. The complex interplay between hydrogen and the PDH process also extends to changes in heat transfer, mass transport, and surface chemistry of the catalyst. Understanding these comprehensive effects is crucial for optimizing industrial PDH operations and developing more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for propylene production.
