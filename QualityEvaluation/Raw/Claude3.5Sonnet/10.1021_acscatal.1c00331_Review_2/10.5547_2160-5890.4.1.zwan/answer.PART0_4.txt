The given literature does not contain any information about hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process or its effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. The document appears to be about the International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE) and its publications, particularly focusing on a paper about shale gas development in the United States. It does not address the specific technical details of the PDH process or hydrogen cofeeding as asked in the question.
