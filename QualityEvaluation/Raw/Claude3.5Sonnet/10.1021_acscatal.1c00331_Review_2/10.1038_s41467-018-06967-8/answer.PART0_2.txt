[1] "Herein, we describe an approach to breaking the scaling relationship for propane dehydrogenation, an industrially important reaction, by assembling single atom alloys (SAAs), to achieve simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion."

[2] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[3] "Catalytic conditions: atmospheric pressure, 600 C, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, with balance N2 for total flow rate of 50 mL min1, WHSV of propane = 4 h1 and 250 mg of sample"

[4] "The TPO profile of Pt/Cu SAA is very close to that of Cu nanoparticles, verifying its excellent anti-coke capability."

The literature does not directly address the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used in the reaction conditions, which suggests it plays a role in the process.

The Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst showed excellent stability for over 120 hours at 520°C under atmospheric pressure. This stability was achieved with a 1:1 ratio of propane to hydrogen in the feed gas, indicating that hydrogen cofeeding may contribute to maintaining catalyst stability.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst demonstrated excellent anti-coke capability, comparable to that of Cu nanoparticles. This suggests that the presence of hydrogen in the feed may help reduce coke formation on the catalyst surface.

While the document does not explicitly discuss the impact of hydrogen on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it implies that the combination of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst structure and the reaction conditions (including hydrogen cofeeding) results in improved overall process efficiency and performance, as evidenced by the simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion.

To fully understand the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on these aspects of the PDH process, further research and more detailed studies would be necessary.

文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响。然而，它确实提到在反应条件中使用了氢气，这表明氢气在该过程中发挥了作用。

Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAA)催化剂在520°C、大气压下表现出超过120小时的优异稳定性。这种稳定性是在进料气中丙烷与氢气比例为1:1的条件下实现的，表明氢气共进料可能有助于维持催化剂的稳定性。

Pt/Cu SAA催化剂展示了与Cu纳米粒子相当的优异抗焦性能。这表明进料中氢气的存在可能有助于减少催化剂表面的焦炭形成。

虽然文档没有明确讨论氢气对能量障碍、焦炭累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响，但它暗示Pt/Cu SAA催化剂结构与反应条件（包括氢气共进料）的组合可以提高整体工艺效率和性能，这从丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率的同时提高可以看出。

要充分理解氢气共进料对PDH过程这些方面的具体影响，需要进行进一步的研究和更详细的分析。
