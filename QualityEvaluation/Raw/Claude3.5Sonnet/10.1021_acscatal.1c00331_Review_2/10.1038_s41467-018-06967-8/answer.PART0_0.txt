[1] "Note that our convergence test suggests Pt/Cu (111) surface model can well describe Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles which are larger than 2.1 nm in diameter (Pt/Cu404, Supplementary Figure 2)."

[2] "When treated under H2-rich condition at 600 C for 1 h, the oxide species of Pt and Cu on γ-alumina can be fully reduced since the highest reduction peak temperature for PtCu bimetallic catalysts is below 200 C (Supplementary Figure 6)."

[3] "Catalytic test conditions: atmospheric pressure, WHSV propane = 4 h1, 250 mg of sample, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, with balance N2 for total flow rate of 50 mL min1"

The provided literature does not directly address the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document mentions hydrogen being used in the reduction process of catalysts and as part of the reaction conditions, but it does not discuss its impact on coke formation, energy barriers, or acid site conversions.

The literature focuses more on the development and performance of Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts for PDH, rather than the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding. Without more relevant information, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question about hydrogen's impact on the PDH process efficiency and performance.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响。文献中提到氢气被用于催化剂的还原过程和作为反应条件的一部分，但并未讨论其对积碳形成、能量障碍或酸性位点转化的影响。

这篇文献更多地关注了Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAA)催化剂在PDH中的开发和性能，而非氢气共进料的具体影响。由于缺乏更多相关信息，无法就氢气对PDH过程效率和性能的影响提供全面的答案。
