          "Catalytic test conditions: atmospheric pressure, WHSV propane = 4 h1, 250 mg of sample, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, with balance N2 for total flow rate of 50 mL min1"

          "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

          "The TPO profile of Pt/Cu SAA is very close to that of Cu nanoparticles, verifying its excellent anti-coke capability."

          "In terms of deactivation, a first-order deactivation model is used to estimate the catalyst stability55. The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07 h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Supplementary Table 9)."

          "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke56."

          "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile. We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335 C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 C) > 10Cu (225 C)56,57."

          While the literature does not directly address the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on propane dehydrogenation (PDH), it does provide some insights into catalyst performance and coke formation under conditions that include hydrogen in the feed:

          1. Reaction conditions: The catalytic tests were conducted with a 1:1 ratio of C3H8/H2, indicating that hydrogen was indeed present in the feed.

          2. Catalyst stability: The Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst showed excellent stability for over 120 hours at 520°C under atmospheric pressure. The 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated a significantly lower deactivation rate (0.0005 h-1) compared to the 0.1Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.07 h-1), indicating improved stability.

          3. Coke formation: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst exhibited excellent anti-coke capability, comparable to that of Cu nanoparticles. Two types of coke were identified: hard coke on the support and soft coke on the metal. The dehydrogenation degree of coke increased in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3.

          4. Coke removal: The combustion temperatures for soft coke decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335°C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265°C) > 10Cu (225°C), suggesting that coke formed on the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is easier to remove than that on the Pt-only catalyst.

          While these findings suggest that the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst may have better resistance to coke formation and improved stability compared to traditional Pt catalysts in PDH processes with hydrogen present, the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization are not directly addressed. Further research would be necessary to fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on these aspects and overall process efficiency.

          虽然文献没有直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)的具体影响,但它确实提供了一些关于在含氢进料条件下催化剂性能和积碳形成的见解:

          1. 反应条件:催化测试是在C3H8/H2比例为1:1的条件下进行的,表明进料中确实存在氢气。

          2. 催化剂稳定性:Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAA)催化剂在520°C、大气压下表现出超过120小时的优异稳定性。0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3催化剂的失活速率(0.0005 h-1)显著低于0.1Pt/Al2O3催化剂(0.07 h-1),表明稳定性得到改善。

          3. 积碳形成:Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出优异的抗积碳能力,与Cu纳米颗粒相当。识别出两种类型的积碳:载体上的硬焦和金属上的软焦。积碳的脱氢程度按0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3的顺序增加。

          4. 积碳去除:软焦的燃烧温度按0.1Pt(335°C) > 0.1Pt10Cu(265°C) > 10Cu(225°C)的顺序降低,表明在Pt/Cu SAA催化剂上形成的积碳比单铂催化剂上的更容易去除。

          虽然这些发现表明,在含氢的PDH过程中,Pt/Cu SAA催化剂可能具有更好的抗积碳能力和更高的稳定性,但文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、积碳积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化的具体影响。需要进一步的研究才能充分理解氢气共进料对这些方面和整体过程效率的影响。
