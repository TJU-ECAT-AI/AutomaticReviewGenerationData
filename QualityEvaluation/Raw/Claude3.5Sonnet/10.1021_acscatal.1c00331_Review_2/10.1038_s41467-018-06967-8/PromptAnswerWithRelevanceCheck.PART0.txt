[1] "Note that our convergence test suggests Pt/Cu (111) surface model can well describe Pt/Cu SAA nanoparticles which are larger than 2.1 nm in diameter (Pt/Cu404, Supplementary Figure 2)."

[2] "When treated under H2-rich condition at 600 C for 1 h, the oxide species of Pt and Cu on γ-alumina can be fully reduced since the highest reduction peak temperature for PtCu bimetallic catalysts is below 200 C (Supplementary Figure 6)."

The provided literature does not directly address the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document mentions hydrogen being used in the reduction process of catalysts and as part of the reaction conditions, but it does not discuss its impact on coke formation, energy barriers, or acid site conversions.

The literature focuses more on the development and performance of Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts for PDH, rather than the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding. Without more relevant information, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question about hydrogen's impact on the PDH process efficiency and performance.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响。文献中提到氢气被用于催化剂的还原过程和作为反应条件的一部分，但并未讨论其对积碳形成、能量障碍或酸性位点转化的影响。

这篇文献更多地关注了Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAA)催化剂在PDH中的开发和性能，而非氢气共进料的具体影响。由于缺乏更多相关信息，无法就氢气对PDH过程效率和性能的影响提供全面的答案。

[1] "In terms of deactivation, a first-order deactivation model is used to estimate the catalyst stability55. The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07 h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Supplementary Table 9)."

[2] "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke56."

[3] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile. We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335 C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 C) > 10Cu (225 C)56,57."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. However, it does provide some insights into catalyst stability and coke formation without hydrogen cofeeding:

1. Catalyst stability: The Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst (0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3) shows significantly higher stability compared to the Pt-only catalyst (0.1Pt/Al2O3), with deactivation rates of 0.0005 h-1 and 0.07 h-1, respectively.

2. Coke formation: The literature indicates two types of coke formation - hard coke on the support and soft coke on the metal. The dehydrogenation degree of coke increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3, suggesting that the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst has an intermediate level of coke formation compared to Pt-only and Cu-only catalysts.

3. Coke combustion temperatures: The soft coke combustion temperatures decrease in the order of 0.1Pt (335°C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265°C) > 10Cu (225°C), indicating that the coke formed on the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is easier to remove than that on the Pt-only catalyst.

While the document does not specifically address hydrogen cofeeding, these findings suggest that the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst may have better resistance to coke formation and improved stability compared to traditional Pt catalysts in PDH processes. However, to fully understand the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, additional research would be necessary.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于催化剂稳定性和积碳形成的见解（在没有氢气共进料的情况下）：

1. 催化剂稳定性：铂/铜单原子合金（SAA）催化剂（0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3）比单铂催化剂（0.1Pt/Al2O3）显示出显著更高的稳定性，失活速率分别为0.0005 h-1和0.07 h-1。

2. 积碳形成：文献指出有两种类型的积碳形成 - 载体上的硬焦和金属上的软焦。积碳的脱氢程度按0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3的顺序增加，这表明Pt/Cu SAA催化剂的积碳形成程度介于单铂和单铜催化剂之间。

3. 积碳燃烧温度：软焦的燃烧温度按0.1Pt（335°C）> 0.1Pt10Cu（265°C）> 10Cu（225°C）的顺序降低，表明在Pt/Cu SAA催化剂上形成的积碳比单铂催化剂上的更容易去除。

虽然文档没有特别提到氢气共进料，但这些发现表明，与传统的铂催化剂相比，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在PDH过程中可能具有更好的抗积碳能力和更高的稳定性。然而，要充分理解氢气共进料对能量障碍、积碳积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化的影响，还需要进行额外的研究。

[2] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

The literature does not directly address the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used in the reaction conditions, which suggests it plays a role in the process.

The Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst showed excellent stability for over 120 hours at 520°C under atmospheric pressure. This stability was achieved with a 1:1 ratio of propane to hydrogen in the feed gas, indicating that hydrogen cofeeding may contribute to maintaining catalyst stability.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst demonstrated excellent anti-coke capability, comparable to that of Cu nanoparticles. This suggests that the presence of hydrogen in the feed may help reduce coke formation on the catalyst surface.

While the document does not explicitly discuss the impact of hydrogen on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it implies that the combination of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst structure and the reaction conditions (including hydrogen cofeeding) results in improved overall process efficiency and performance, as evidenced by the simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion.

To fully understand the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on these aspects of the PDH process, further research and more detailed studies would be necessary.

文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响。然而，它确实提到在反应条件中使用了氢气，这表明氢气在该过程中发挥了作用。

Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAA)催化剂在520°C、大气压下表现出超过120小时的优异稳定性。这种稳定性是在进料气中丙烷与氢气比例为1:1的条件下实现的，表明氢气共进料可能有助于维持催化剂的稳定性。

Pt/Cu SAA催化剂展示了与Cu纳米粒子相当的优异抗焦性能。这表明进料中氢气的存在可能有助于减少催化剂表面的焦炭形成。

虽然文档没有明确讨论氢气对能量障碍、焦炭累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响，但它暗示Pt/Cu SAA催化剂结构与反应条件（包括氢气共进料）的组合可以提高整体工艺效率和性能，这从丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率的同时提高可以看出。

要充分理解氢气共进料对PDH过程这些方面的具体影响，需要进行进一步的研究和更详细的分析。

The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used in a 1:1 ratio with propane during catalytic testing. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding is a standard practice in PDH reactions, likely to help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity. Without more specific information, we cannot draw conclusions about its effects on energy barriers, coke accumulation, acid site conversions, or graphitization. Further research would be needed to fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on PDH process efficiency and performance.
