[1] "In terms of deactivation, a first-order deactivation model is used to estimate the catalyst stability55. The low deactivation rate of 0.0005 h1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07 h1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Supplementary Table 9)."

[2] "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke56."

[3] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile. We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335 C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 C) > 10Cu (225 C)56,57."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. However, it does provide some insights into catalyst stability and coke formation without hydrogen cofeeding:

1. Catalyst stability: The Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst (0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3) shows significantly higher stability compared to the Pt-only catalyst (0.1Pt/Al2O3), with deactivation rates of 0.0005 h-1 and 0.07 h-1, respectively.

2. Coke formation: The literature indicates two types of coke formation - hard coke on the support and soft coke on the metal. The dehydrogenation degree of coke increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3, suggesting that the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst has an intermediate level of coke formation compared to Pt-only and Cu-only catalysts.

3. Coke combustion temperatures: The soft coke combustion temperatures decrease in the order of 0.1Pt (335°C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265°C) > 10Cu (225°C), indicating that the coke formed on the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is easier to remove than that on the Pt-only catalyst.

While the document does not specifically address hydrogen cofeeding, these findings suggest that the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst may have better resistance to coke formation and improved stability compared to traditional Pt catalysts in PDH processes. However, to fully understand the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization, additional research would be necessary.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于催化剂稳定性和积碳形成的见解（在没有氢气共进料的情况下）：

1. 催化剂稳定性：铂/铜单原子合金（SAA）催化剂（0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3）比单铂催化剂（0.1Pt/Al2O3）显示出显著更高的稳定性，失活速率分别为0.0005 h-1和0.07 h-1。

2. 积碳形成：文献指出有两种类型的积碳形成 - 载体上的硬焦和金属上的软焦。积碳的脱氢程度按0.1Pt/Al2O3 < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 < 10Cu/Al2O3的顺序增加，这表明Pt/Cu SAA催化剂的积碳形成程度介于单铂和单铜催化剂之间。

3. 积碳燃烧温度：软焦的燃烧温度按0.1Pt（335°C）> 0.1Pt10Cu（265°C）> 10Cu（225°C）的顺序降低，表明在Pt/Cu SAA催化剂上形成的积碳比单铂催化剂上的更容易去除。

虽然文档没有特别提到氢气共进料，但这些发现表明，与传统的铂催化剂相比，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在PDH过程中可能具有更好的抗积碳能力和更高的稳定性。然而，要充分理解氢气共进料对能量障碍、积碳积累模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化的影响，还需要进行额外的研究。
