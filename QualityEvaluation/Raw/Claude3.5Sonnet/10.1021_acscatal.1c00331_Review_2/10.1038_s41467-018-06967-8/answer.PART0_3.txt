[1] "With the addition of a flow of 3 mL min1 of CO, the adsorption of CO molecules on the surface of the catalysts continued for 30 min."

[2] "Catalytic test conditions: atmospheric pressure, WHSV propane = 4 h1, 250 mg of sample, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, with balance N2 for total flow rate of 50 mL min1"

The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used in a 1:1 ratio with propane during catalytic testing. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding is a standard practice in PDH reactions, likely to help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity. Without more specific information, we cannot draw conclusions about its effects on energy barriers, coke accumulation, acid site conversions, or graphitization. Further research would be needed to fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on PDH process efficiency and performance.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。然而,它确实提到在催化测试中使用了1:1的氢气与丙烷比例。这表明氢气共进料是PDH反应中的标准做法,可能有助于维持催化剂的活性和选择性。由于缺乏更具体的信息,我们无法就其对能量障碍、积碳累积、酸性位点转化或石墨化的影响得出结论。需要进一步的研究才能充分理解氢气共进料对PDH过程效率和性能的影响。
