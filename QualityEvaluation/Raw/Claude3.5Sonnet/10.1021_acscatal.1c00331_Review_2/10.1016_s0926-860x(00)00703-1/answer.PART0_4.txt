The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is normally used to prevent extensive coking. Despite this, the study found that using hydrogen as a diluent produced inferior results compared to steam.

The presence of tin (Sn) in the catalyst was thought to alter hydrogen adsorption, which could affect reaction mechanisms. However, the best catalyst performance was observed with steam rather than hydrogen as the diluent. 

The study does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also doesn't discuss the implications for overall process efficiency and performance when using hydrogen.

Instead, the research emphasizes the advantages of using steam as a diluent, which produced significantly higher propylene yields and showed substantial benefits in terms of coke formation and catalyst stability, especially for the optimized catalyst sample.

该文献对氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中的具体影响提供了有限的信息。然而,它确实提到氢气通常用于防止大量结焦。尽管如此,研究发现与蒸汽相比,使用氢气作为稀释剂产生了较差的结果。

催化剂中锡(Sn)的存在被认为会改变氢气的吸附,这可能会影响反应机理。然而,最佳的催化剂性能是在使用蒸汽而非氢气作为稀释剂时观察到的。

该研究没有提供关于氢气如何影响能量障碍、结焦累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的详细信息。它也没有讨论使用氢气时对整体工艺效率和性能的影响。

相反,研究强调了使用蒸汽作为稀释剂的优势,它产生了显著更高的丙烯产率,并在结焦形成和催化剂稳定性方面显示出实质性的益处,特别是对于优化的催化剂样品。
