The literature provides some insights on how hydrogen cofeeding affects the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process:

1. Hydrogen is typically used to prevent extensive coking, suggesting it plays a role in reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability.

2. However, the study found that using hydrogen as a diluent yielded inferior results compared to steam.

3. Catalysts containing platinum, tin, and potassium showed the best performance, with significantly higher propylene yields in a steam environment rather than hydrogen.

4. The amount of coke on feed (a measure of catalyst stability) was similar for optimized catalyst samples in both steam and hydrogen environments. However, other samples showed higher coke levels, particularly in steam experiments.

5. Overall, steam demonstrated a substantial advantage over hydrogen, especially for the optimized catalyst sample.

The literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, specific coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also doesn't directly discuss the implications for overall process efficiency. However, the results suggest that while hydrogen can help prevent coking, it may not be as effective as steam in improving overall catalyst performance and propylene yield in the PDH process.

该文献对氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程提供了一些见解：

1. 氢气通常用于防止大量积碳，表明它在减少积碳形成和提高催化剂稳定性方面发挥作用。

2. 然而，研究发现，与蒸汽相比，使用氢气作为稀释剂的效果较差。

3. 含有铂、锡和钾的催化剂表现最佳，在蒸汽环境中的丙烯产率显著高于氢气环境。

4. 对于优化的催化剂样品，在蒸汽和氢气环境中，进料中的积碳量（催化剂稳定性的衡量标准）相似。但其他样品显示出更高的积碳水平，特别是在蒸汽实验中。

5. 总的来说，蒸汽相比氢气显示出显著优势，尤其是对于优化的催化剂样品。

该文献没有提供关于氢气如何影响能量障碍、具体积碳积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的详细信息。它也没有直接讨论对整体工艺效率的影响。然而，结果表明，虽然氢气可以帮助防止积碳，但在提高PDH过程中的整体催化剂性能和丙烯产率方面，可能不如蒸汽有效。
