[1] "Hydrogen is normally used in those systems to prevent extensive coking."

[2] "The function of Sn was considered to be alteration of hydrogen adsorption [6,912]."

[3] "Inferior results were measured with hydrogen as diluent."

[4] "The best performance was measured with catalysts that contained all three components in samples 57. A significantly higher yield of propylene was produced in steam environment."

[5] "Coke formation is a critical measure of catalyst stability. The low coke concentration on the catalyst at the end of the run, listed in Table 2, did not change catalyst activity."

[6] "The advantage of steam, illustrated by the values in Table 2, is substantial especially for optimized sample 7."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen helps prevent extensive coking, but is less effective than steam. The study found lower coke concentrations with steam compared to hydrogen.

2. Catalyst stability: While hydrogen improves stability by reducing coking, the study found that catalysts performed better in a steam environment, with lower coke formation and higher propylene yields.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of hydrogen alters adsorption properties, particularly in Pt-Sn catalysts. However, the study found that steam was more effective in enhancing the dehydrogenation rate.

4. Energy barriers: The study doesn't directly address energy barriers, but the higher propylene yields in steam suggest lower energy barriers compared to hydrogen.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Specific patterns are not discussed, but overall coke formation was lower with steam than hydrogen.

6. Acid site conversions: The study doesn't explicitly discuss acid site conversions.

7. Graphitization: This aspect is not directly addressed in the given literature.

Overall, while hydrogen does help prevent coking and improve catalyst stability to some extent, the study found that steam was more effective in enhancing process efficiency and performance. Steam led to higher propylene yields, lower coke formation, and better overall catalyst performance compared to hydrogen.

氢气在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的共进料有以下几个影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气有助于防止大量结焦，但效果不如蒸汽。研究发现，与氢气相比，蒸汽环境下的焦炭浓度更低。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然氢气通过减少结焦来提高稳定性，但研究发现催化剂在蒸汽环境中表现更好，焦炭形成更少，丙烯产率更高。

3. 反应机理：氢气的存在改变了吸附特性，特别是在Pt-Sn催化剂中。然而，研究发现蒸汽在提高脱氢速率方面更有效。

4. 能量障碍：研究没有直接讨论能量障碍，但蒸汽环境下更高的丙烯产率表明能量障碍可能低于氢气环境。

5. 焦炭积累模式：虽然没有讨论具体模式，但总体上蒸汽环境下的焦炭形成比氢气环境下少。

6. 酸性位转化：研究没有明确讨论酸性位转化。

7. 石墨化：给定的文献中没有直接讨论这一方面。

总的来说，虽然氢气在一定程度上有助于防止结焦和提高催化剂稳定性，但研究发现蒸汽在提高过程效率和性能方面更有效。与氢气相比，蒸汽导致更高的丙烯产率，更低的焦炭形成，以及更好的整体催化剂性能。
