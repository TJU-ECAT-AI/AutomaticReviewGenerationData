[1] "Hydrogen is normally used in those systems to prevent extensive coking."

[2] "Inferior results were measured with hydrogen as diluent."

[3] "The rates listed in Table 3 indicate a significant effect of Sn, in the case of steam environment. In hydrogen the effect was much smaller."

[4] "The advantage of steam, illustrated by the values in Table 2, is substantial especially for optimized sample 7."

[5] "Coke on sample 1 blocked Pt completely providing a measure for the coke tolerance developed previously [4,20]. Regeneration recovered 74% of initial intensity of Pt spectra"

[6] "Coke blocked only about 8% of the Pt surface, negligible in comparison with sample 1. This indicates an essential coke tolerance effect of tin, observed in steam environment for the first time, whereas previous data [4,5,20] were obtained in hydrogen medium."

The literature suggests that hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has both positive and negative effects on the process:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen is used to prevent extensive coking. However, the study found that steam was more effective at inhibiting coke formation than hydrogen.

2. Catalyst stability: While hydrogen helps prevent coking, which can improve catalyst stability, the study found that catalysts performed better in a steam environment than in hydrogen.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of hydrogen appears to reduce the effectiveness of promoters like tin. The study found that tin had a much more significant effect on reaction rates in a steam environment compared to hydrogen.

4. Overall process efficiency and performance: The study consistently found that steam yielded superior results compared to hydrogen as a diluent. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding may actually reduce overall process efficiency and performance compared to using steam.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: In the absence of promoters like tin, coke completely blocked platinum surfaces when hydrogen was used. With tin present, coke blockage was significantly reduced, but this effect was more pronounced in steam than in hydrogen.

6. Acid site conversions and graphitization: The study does not provide specific information on these aspects.

The implications of these effects suggest that while hydrogen cofeeding can help prevent coking to some extent, it may not be the optimal choice for PDH processes. The study indicates that steam environments, especially when combined with optimized catalyst compositions (including promoters like tin and potassium), can provide better overall performance in terms of coke resistance, catalyst stability, and reaction efficiency.

文献表明，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气具有正面和负面的影响：

1. 积碳形成：氢气用于防止过度积碳。然而，研究发现蒸汽在抑制积碳方面比氢气更有效。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然氢气有助于防止积碳，从而提高催化剂稳定性，但研究发现催化剂在蒸汽环境中的表现优于氢气环境。

3. 反应机理：氢气的存在似乎降低了锡等促进剂的有效性。研究发现，在蒸汽环境中，锡对反应速率的影响比在氢气环境中更显著。

4. 整体过程效率和性能：研究一致发现，与氢气作为稀释剂相比，蒸汽产生了更好的结果。这表明，与使用蒸汽相比，添加氢气可能实际上会降低整体过程效率和性能。

5. 积碳累积模式：在没有锡等促进剂的情况下，当使用氢气时，积碳完全阻塞了铂表面。有锡存在时，积碳阻塞显著减少，但这种效果在蒸汽中比在氢气中更明显。

6. 酸性位点转化和石墨化：研究没有提供这些方面的具体信息。

这些影响的意义表明，虽然添加氢气在一定程度上可以帮助防止积碳，但它可能不是PDH过程的最佳选择。研究表明，蒸汽环境，特别是当与优化的催化剂组成（包括锡和钾等促进剂）结合时，可以在积碳抵抗、催化剂稳定性和反应效率方面提供更好的整体性能。
