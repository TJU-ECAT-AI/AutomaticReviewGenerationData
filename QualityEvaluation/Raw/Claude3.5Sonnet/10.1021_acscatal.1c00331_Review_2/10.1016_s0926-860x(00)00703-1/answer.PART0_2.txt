Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has some effects on coke formation and catalyst stability, but overall appears less effective than steam as a reaction medium. 

Hydrogen is normally used to prevent extensive coking, suggesting it helps reduce coke formation to some degree. However, the study found that steam was more effective at inhibiting coke formation, with substantially lower coke levels observed when using steam compared to hydrogen.

In terms of catalyst stability, the presence of tin was found to provide coke tolerance in both hydrogen and steam environments. However, steam maximized this effect of tin promotion.

Regarding reaction mechanisms, the study suggests hydrogen alters adsorption properties on the catalyst surface, particularly in interaction with tin. However, inferior results were measured using hydrogen as a diluent compared to steam.

The implications are that while hydrogen provides some benefits in reducing coking and improving stability, steam appears to be a superior reaction medium for PDH in terms of overall process efficiency and performance. Steam led to significantly higher propylene yields and better coke tolerance, especially with an optimized catalyst composition.

The study did not provide detailed information on hydrogen's specific impacts on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization patterns. More research would be needed to fully elucidate these mechanistic effects.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气对焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性有一定影响，但总体上似乎不如蒸汽作为反应介质有效。

氢气通常用于防止大量结焦，这表明它在一定程度上有助于减少焦炭形成。然而，研究发现蒸汽在抑制焦炭形成方面更有效，使用蒸汽时观察到的焦炭水平明显低于使用氢气时。

在催化剂稳定性方面，研究发现无论在氢气还是蒸汽环境中，锡的存在都能提供抗焦性。但是，蒸汽最大化了这种锡促进的效果。

关于反应机理，研究表明氢气改变了催化剂表面的吸附性质，特别是在与锡的相互作用方面。然而，与蒸汽相比，使用氢气作为稀释剂的效果较差。

这些发现意味着，虽然氢气在减少结焦和提高稳定性方面提供了一些好处，但就整体工艺效率和性能而言，蒸汽似乎是PDH的更优反应介质。蒸汽导致明显更高的丙烯产率和更好的抗焦性，特别是在优化的催化剂组成下。

该研究没有提供关于氢气对能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化模式的具体影响的详细信息。需要进行更多研究以充分阐明这些机制效应。
