Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen helps prevent extensive coking, but is less effective than steam. The study found lower coke concentrations with steam compared to hydrogen.

2. Catalyst stability: While hydrogen improves stability by reducing coking, the study found that catalysts performed better in a steam environment, with lower coke formation and higher propylene yields.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of hydrogen alters adsorption properties, particularly in Pt-Sn catalysts. However, the study found that steam was more effective in enhancing the dehydrogenation rate.

4. Energy barriers: The study doesn't directly address energy barriers, but the higher propylene yields in steam suggest lower energy barriers compared to hydrogen.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Specific patterns are not discussed, but overall coke formation was lower with steam than hydrogen.

6. Acid site conversions: The study doesn't explicitly discuss acid site conversions.

7. Graphitization: This aspect is not directly addressed in the given literature.

Overall, while hydrogen does help prevent coking and improve catalyst stability to some extent, the study found that steam was more effective in enhancing process efficiency and performance. Steam led to higher propylene yields, lower coke formation, and better overall catalyst performance compared to hydrogen.

氢气在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的共进料有以下几个影响：

1. 焦炭形成：氢气有助于防止大量结焦，但效果不如蒸汽。研究发现，与氢气相比，蒸汽环境下的焦炭浓度更低。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然氢气通过减少结焦来提高稳定性，但研究发现催化剂在蒸汽环境中表现更好，焦炭形成更少，丙烯产率更高。

3. 反应机理：氢气的存在改变了吸附特性，特别是在Pt-Sn催化剂中。然而，研究发现蒸汽在提高脱氢速率方面更有效。

4. 能量障碍：研究没有直接讨论能量障碍，但蒸汽环境下更高的丙烯产率表明能量障碍可能低于氢气环境。

5. 焦炭积累模式：虽然没有讨论具体模式，但总体上蒸汽环境下的焦炭形成比氢气环境下少。

6. 酸性位转化：研究没有明确讨论酸性位转化。

7. 石墨化：给定的文献中没有直接讨论这一方面。

总的来说，虽然氢气在一定程度上有助于防止结焦和提高催化剂稳定性，但研究发现蒸汽在提高过程效率和性能方面更有效。与氢气相比，蒸汽导致更高的丙烯产率，更低的焦炭形成，以及更好的整体催化剂性能。

The literature suggests that hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has both positive and negative effects on the process:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen is used to prevent extensive coking. However, the study found that steam was more effective at inhibiting coke formation than hydrogen.

2. Catalyst stability: While hydrogen helps prevent coking, which can improve catalyst stability, the study found that catalysts performed better in a steam environment than in hydrogen.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of hydrogen appears to reduce the effectiveness of promoters like tin. The study found that tin had a much more significant effect on reaction rates in a steam environment compared to hydrogen.

4. Overall process efficiency and performance: The study consistently found that steam yielded superior results compared to hydrogen as a diluent. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding may actually reduce overall process efficiency and performance compared to using steam.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: In the absence of promoters like tin, coke completely blocked platinum surfaces when hydrogen was used. With tin present, coke blockage was significantly reduced, but this effect was more pronounced in steam than in hydrogen.

6. Acid site conversions and graphitization: The study does not provide specific information on these aspects.

The implications of these effects suggest that while hydrogen cofeeding can help prevent coking to some extent, it may not be the optimal choice for PDH processes. The study indicates that steam environments, especially when combined with optimized catalyst compositions (including promoters like tin and potassium), can provide better overall performance in terms of coke resistance, catalyst stability, and reaction efficiency.

文献表明，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气具有正面和负面的影响：

1. 积碳形成：氢气用于防止过度积碳。然而，研究发现蒸汽在抑制积碳方面比氢气更有效。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然氢气有助于防止积碳，从而提高催化剂稳定性，但研究发现催化剂在蒸汽环境中的表现优于氢气环境。

3. 反应机理：氢气的存在似乎降低了锡等促进剂的有效性。研究发现，在蒸汽环境中，锡对反应速率的影响比在氢气环境中更显著。

4. 整体过程效率和性能：研究一致发现，与氢气作为稀释剂相比，蒸汽产生了更好的结果。这表明，与使用蒸汽相比，添加氢气可能实际上会降低整体过程效率和性能。

5. 积碳累积模式：在没有锡等促进剂的情况下，当使用氢气时，积碳完全阻塞了铂表面。有锡存在时，积碳阻塞显著减少，但这种效果在蒸汽中比在氢气中更明显。

6. 酸性位点转化和石墨化：研究没有提供这些方面的具体信息。

这些影响的意义表明，虽然添加氢气在一定程度上可以帮助防止积碳，但它可能不是PDH过程的最佳选择。研究表明，蒸汽环境，特别是当与优化的催化剂组成（包括锡和钾等促进剂）结合时，可以在积碳抵抗、催化剂稳定性和反应效率方面提供更好的整体性能。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has some effects on coke formation and catalyst stability, but overall appears less effective than steam as a reaction medium. 

Hydrogen is normally used to prevent extensive coking, suggesting it helps reduce coke formation to some degree. However, the study found that steam was more effective at inhibiting coke formation, with substantially lower coke levels observed when using steam compared to hydrogen.

In terms of catalyst stability, the presence of tin was found to provide coke tolerance in both hydrogen and steam environments. However, steam maximized this effect of tin promotion.

Regarding reaction mechanisms, the study suggests hydrogen alters adsorption properties on the catalyst surface, particularly in interaction with tin. However, inferior results were measured using hydrogen as a diluent compared to steam.

The implications are that while hydrogen provides some benefits in reducing coking and improving stability, steam appears to be a superior reaction medium for PDH in terms of overall process efficiency and performance. Steam led to significantly higher propylene yields and better coke tolerance, especially with an optimized catalyst composition.

The study did not provide detailed information on hydrogen's specific impacts on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization patterns. More research would be needed to fully elucidate these mechanistic effects.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气对焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性有一定影响，但总体上似乎不如蒸汽作为反应介质有效。

氢气通常用于防止大量结焦，这表明它在一定程度上有助于减少焦炭形成。然而，研究发现蒸汽在抑制焦炭形成方面更有效，使用蒸汽时观察到的焦炭水平明显低于使用氢气时。

在催化剂稳定性方面，研究发现无论在氢气还是蒸汽环境中，锡的存在都能提供抗焦性。但是，蒸汽最大化了这种锡促进的效果。

关于反应机理，研究表明氢气改变了催化剂表面的吸附性质，特别是在与锡的相互作用方面。然而，与蒸汽相比，使用氢气作为稀释剂的效果较差。

这些发现意味着，虽然氢气在减少结焦和提高稳定性方面提供了一些好处，但就整体工艺效率和性能而言，蒸汽似乎是PDH的更优反应介质。蒸汽导致明显更高的丙烯产率和更好的抗焦性，特别是在优化的催化剂组成下。

该研究没有提供关于氢气对能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化模式的具体影响的详细信息。需要进行更多研究以充分阐明这些机制效应。

The literature provides some insights on how hydrogen cofeeding affects the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process:

1. Hydrogen is typically used to prevent extensive coking, suggesting it plays a role in reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability.

2. However, the study found that using hydrogen as a diluent yielded inferior results compared to steam.

3. Catalysts containing platinum, tin, and potassium showed the best performance, with significantly higher propylene yields in a steam environment rather than hydrogen.

4. The amount of coke on feed (a measure of catalyst stability) was similar for optimized catalyst samples in both steam and hydrogen environments. However, other samples showed higher coke levels, particularly in steam experiments.

5. Overall, steam demonstrated a substantial advantage over hydrogen, especially for the optimized catalyst sample.

The literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, specific coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also doesn't directly discuss the implications for overall process efficiency. However, the results suggest that while hydrogen can help prevent coking, it may not be as effective as steam in improving overall catalyst performance and propylene yield in the PDH process.

The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is normally used to prevent extensive coking. Despite this, the study found that using hydrogen as a diluent produced inferior results compared to steam.

The presence of tin (Sn) in the catalyst was thought to alter hydrogen adsorption, which could affect reaction mechanisms. However, the best catalyst performance was observed with steam rather than hydrogen as the diluent. 

The study does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. It also doesn't discuss the implications for overall process efficiency and performance when using hydrogen.

Instead, the research emphasizes the advantages of using steam as a diluent, which produced significantly higher propylene yields and showed substantial benefits in terms of coke formation and catalyst stability, especially for the optimized catalyst sample.

催化剂中锡(Sn)的存在被认为会改变氢气的吸附,这可能会影响反应机理。然而,最佳的催化剂性能是在使用蒸汽而非氢气作为稀释剂时观察到的。

该研究没有提供关于氢气如何影响能量障碍、结焦累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的详细信息。它也没有讨论使用氢气时对整体工艺效率和性能的影响。

相反,研究强调了使用蒸汽作为稀释剂的优势,它产生了显著更高的丙烯产率,并在结焦形成和催化剂稳定性方面显示出实质性的益处,特别是对于优化的催化剂样品。
