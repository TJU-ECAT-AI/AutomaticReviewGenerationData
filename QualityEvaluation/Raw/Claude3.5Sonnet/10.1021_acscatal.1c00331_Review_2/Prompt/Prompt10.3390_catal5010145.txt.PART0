Abstract: Deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts is a ubiquitous problem that causes loss 
of catalytic rate with time. This review on deactivation and regeneration of heterogeneous 
catalysts classifies deactivation by type (chemical, thermal, and mechanical) and by 
mechanism (poisoning, fouling, thermal degradation, vapor formation, vapor-solid and 
solid-solid reactions, and attrition/crushing). The key features and considerations for each 
of these deactivation types is reviewed in detail with reference to the latest literature 
reports in these areas. Two case studies on the deactivation mechanisms of catalysts used 
for cobalt Fischer-Tropsch and selective catalytic reduction are considered to provide 
additional depth in the topics of sintering, coking, poisoning, and fouling. Regeneration 
considerations and options are also briefly discussed for each deactivation mechanism. 
Keywords: heterogeneous catalysis; deactivation; regeneration 
 
1. Introduction 
Catalyst deactivation, the loss over time of catalytic activity and/or selectivity, is a problem of great 
and continuing concern in the practice of industrial catalytic processes. Costs to industry for catalyst 
replacement and process shutdown total billions of dollars per year. Time scales for catalyst 
deactivation vary considerably; for example, in the case of cracking catalysts, catalyst mortality may 
be on the order of seconds, while in ammonia synthesis the iron catalyst may last for 510 years. 
However, it is inevitable that all catalysts will decay.

Typically, the loss of activity in a well-controlled process occurs slowly. However, process upsets 
or poorly designed hardware can bring about catastrophic failure. For example, in steam reforming of 
methane or naphtha, great care must be taken to avoid reactor operation at excessively high 
temperatures or at steam-to-hydrocarbon ratios below a critical value. Indeed, these conditions can 
cause formation of large quantities of carbon filaments that plug catalyst pores and voids, pulverize 
catalyst pellets, and bring about process shutdown, all within a few hours. 
While catalyst deactivation is inevitable for most processes, some of its immediate, drastic 
consequences may be avoided, postponed, or even reversed. Thus, deactivation issues (i.e., extent, rate, 
and reactivation) greatly impact research, development, design, and operation of commercial 
processes. Accordingly, there is considerable motivation to understand and treat catalyst decay. Over 
the past three decades, the science of catalyst deactivation has been steadily developing, while 
literature addressing this topic has expanded considerably to include books [14], comprehensive 
reviews [58], proceedings of international symposia [914], topical journal issues (e.g., [15]), and 
more than 20,000 U.S. patents for the period of 19762013. (In a U.S. patent search conducted in 
November 2013 for the keywords catalyst and deactivation, catalyst and life, and catalyst and 
regeneration, 14,712, 62,945, and 22,520 patents were found respectively.) This area of research 
provides a critical understanding that is the foundation for modeling deactivation processes, designing 
stable catalysts, and optimizing processes to prevent or slow catalyst deactivation. 
The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the scientific 
and practical aspects of catalyst deactivation with a focus on mechanisms of catalyst decay, prevention 
of deactivation, and regeneration of catalysts. Case studies of deactivation and regeneration of Co 
Fischer-Tropsch catalysts and of commercial catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen 
oxides in stationary sources have been included.  
2. Mechanisms of Deactivation 
There are many paths for heterogeneous catalyst decay. For example, a catalyst solid may be 
poisoned by any one of a dozen contaminants present in the feed. Its surface, pores, and voids may be 
fouled by carbon or coke produced by cracking/condensation reactions of hydrocarbon reactants, 
intermediates, and/or products. In the treatment of a power plant flue gas, the catalyst can be dusted or 
eroded by and/or plugged with fly ash. Catalytic converters used to reduce emissions from gasoline or 
diesel engines may be poisoned or fouled by fuel or lubricant additives and/or engine corrosion 
products. If the catalytic reaction is conducted at high temperatures, thermal degradation may occur in 
the form of active phase crystallite growth, collapse of the carrier (support) pore structure, and/or 
solid-state reactions of the active phase with the carrier or promoters. In addition, the presence of 
oxygen or chlorine in the feed gas can lead to formation of volatile oxides or chlorides of the active 
phase, followed by gas-phase transport from the reactor. Similarly, changes in the oxidation state of 
the active catalytic phase can be induced by the presence of reactive gases in the feed. 
Thus, the mechanisms of solid catalyst deactivation are many; nevertheless, they can be grouped 
into six intrinsic mechanisms of catalyst decay: (1) poisoning, (2) fouling, (3) thermal degradation, (4) 
vapor compound formation and/or leaching accompanied by transport from the catalyst surface or 
particle, (5) vaporsolid and/or solidsolid reactions, and (6) attrition/crushing. As mechanisms 1, 4,

147 
 
and 5 are chemical in nature while 2 and 6 are mechanical, the causes of deactivation are basically 
threefold: chemical, mechanical, and thermal. Each of the six basic mechanisms is defined briefly in 
Table 1 and treated in some detail in the subsections that follow, with an emphasis on the first three. 
Mechanisms 4 and 5 are treated together, since 4 is a subset of 5.

2.1. Poisoning 
Poisoning [3,1622] is the strong chemisorption of reactants, products, or impurities on sites 
otherwise available for catalysis. Thus, poisoning has operational meaning; that is, whether a species 
acts as a poison depends upon its adsorption strength relative to the other species competing for 
catalytic sites. For example, oxygen can be a reactant in partial oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide 
on a silver catalyst and a poison in hydrogenation of ethylene on nickel. In addition to physically 
blocking of adsorption sites, adsorbed poisons may induce changes in the electronic or geometric 
structure of the surface [17,21]. Finally, poisoning may be reversible or irreversible. An example of 
reversible poisoning is the deactivation of acid sites in fluid catalytic cracking catalysts by nitrogen 
compounds in the feed. Although the effects can be severe, they are temporary and are generally 
eliminated within a few hours to days after the nitrogen source is removed from the feed. Similar 
effects have been observed for nitrogen compound (e.g., ammonia and cyanide) addition to the syngas 
of cobalt Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, although these surface species require weeks to months before the 
lost activity is regained [23]. However, most poisons are irreversibly chemisorbed to the catalytic 
surface sites, as is the case for sulfur on most metals, as discussed in detail below. Regardless of 
whether the poisoning is reversible or irreversible, the deactivation effects while the poison is adsorbed 
on the surface are the same. 
Many poisons occur naturally in feed streams that are treated in catalytic processes. For example, 
crude oil contains sulfur and metals, such as vanadium and nickel, that act as catalyst poisons for many 
petroleum refinery processes, especially those that use precious metal catalysts, like catalytic 
reforming, and those that treat heavier hydrocarbon fractions in which the sulfur concentrates and 
metals are almost exclusively found, such as fluid catalytic cracking and residuum hydroprocessing.

Coal contains numerous potential poisons, again including sulfur and others like arsenic, phosphorous, 
and selenium, often concentrated in the ash, that can poison selective catalytic reduction catalysts as 
discussed later in Section 4.3.3.1. As a final example, some poisons may be added purposefully, either 
to moderate the activity and/or to alter the selectivity of fresh catalysts, as discussed as the end of this 
section, or to improve the performance of a product that is later reprocessed catalytically. An example 
of this latter case is lubricating oils that contain additives like zinc and phosphorous to improve their 
lubricating properties and stability, which become poisons when the lubricants are reprocessed in a 
hydrotreater or a fluid catalytic cracking unit. 
Mechanisms by which a poison may affect catalytic activity are multifold, as illustrated by a 
conceptual two-dimensional model of sulfur poisoning of ethylene hydrogenation on a metal surface 
shown in Figure 1. To begin with, a strongly adsorbed atom of sulfur physically blocks at least one 
three- or fourfold adsorption/reaction site (projecting into three dimensions) and three or four topside 
sites on the metal surface. Second, by virtue of its strong chemical bond, it electronically modifies its 
nearest neighbor metal atoms and possibly its next-nearest neighbor atoms, thereby modifying their 
abilities to adsorb and/or dissociate reactant molecules (in this case H2 and ethylene molecules), 
although these effects do not extend beyond about 5 atomic units [21]. A third effect may be the 
restructuring of the surface by the strongly adsorbed poison, possibly causing dramatic changes in 
catalytic properties, especially for reactions sensitive to surface structure. In addition, the adsorbed 
poison blocks access of adsorbed reactants to each other (a fourth effect) and finally prevents or slows 
the surface diffusion of adsorbed reactants (effect number five).

ethylene hydrogenation. Reproduced from [8]. Copyright 2006, Wiley-Interscience. 
Catalyst poisons can be classified according to their chemical makeup, selectivity for active sites, 
and the types of reactions poisoned. Table 2 lists four groups of catalyst poisons classified according to 
chemical origin and their type of interaction with metals. It should be emphasized that interactions of 
Group VAVIIA elements with catalytic metal phases depend on the oxidation state of the former,  
e.g., how many electron pairs are available for bonding and the degree of shielding of the sulfur ion by 
ligands [16]. Thus, the order of decreasing toxicity for poisoning of a given metal by different sulfur 
species is H2S, SO2, SO42, i.e., in the order of increased shielding by oxygen. Toxicity also increases 
with increasing atomic or molecular size and electronegativity, but decreases if the poison can be 
gasified by O2, H2O, or H2 present in the reactant stream [21]; for example, adsorbed carbon can be 
gasified by O2 to CO or CO2 or by H2 to CH4.

Table 3 lists a number of common poisons for selected catalysts in important representative 
reactions. It is apparent that organic bases (e.g., amines) and ammonia are common poisons for acidic 
solids, such as silicaaluminas and zeolites in cracking and hydrocracking reactions, while sulfur- and 
arsenic-containing compounds are typical poisons for metals in hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and 
steam reforming reactions. Metal compounds (e.g., of Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) are poisons in automotive 
emissions control, catalytic cracking, and hydrotreating. Acetylene is a poison for ethylene oxidation, 
while asphaltenes are poisons in hydrotreating of petroleum residuum.

Poisoning selectivity is illustrated in Figure 2, a plot of activity (the reaction rate normalized to 
initial rate) versus normalized poison concentration. Selective poisoning involves preferential 
adsorption of the poison on the most active sites at low concentrations. If sites of lesser activity are 
blocked initially, the poisoning is antiselective. If the activity loss is proportional to the 
Catalysts 2015, 5

concentration of adsorbed poison, the poisoning is nonselective. An example of selective poisoning 
is the deactivation of platinum by CO for the para-H2 conversion (Figure 3a) [24] while Pb poisoning 
of CO oxidation on platinum is apparently antiselective (Figure 3b) [25], and arsenic poisoning of 
cyclopropane hydrogenation on Pt is nonselective (Figure 3c) [26]. For nonselective poisoning, the 
linear decrease in activity with poison concentration or susceptibility (σ) is defined by the slope of the 
activity versus poison concentration curve. Several other important terms associated with poisoning 
are defined in Table 4. Poison tolerance, the activity at saturation coverage of the poison, and 
resistance (the inverse of deactivation rate) are important concepts that are often encountered in 
discussions of poisoning including those below.

The activity versus poison concentration patterns illustrated in Figure 2 are based on the assumption 
of uniform poisoning of the catalyst surface and surface reaction rate controlling, i.e., negligible  
pore-diffusional resistance. These assumptions, however, are rarely met in typical industrial processes 
because the severe reaction conditions of high temperature and high pressure bring about a high  
pore-diffusional resistance for either the main or poisoning reaction or both. In physical terms, this 
means that the reaction may occur preferentially in the outer shell of the catalysts particle, or that 
poison is preferentially adsorbed in the outer shell of the catalyst particle, or both. The nonuniformly 
distributed reaction and/or poison leads to nonlinear activity versus poison concentration curves that 
mimic the patterns in Figure 2 but do not represent truly selective or antiselective poisoning. For 
example, if the main reaction is limited to an outer shell in a pellet where poison is concentrated, the 
drop in activity with concentration will be precipitous. Pore diffusional effects in poisoning 
(nonuniform poison) are treated later in this review.

As sulfur poisoning is a difficult problem in many important catalytic processes (e.g., hydrogenation, 
methanation, FischerTropsch synthesis, steam reforming, and fuel cell power production), it merits 
separate discussion as an example of catalyst poisoning phenomena. Studies of sulfur poisoning in 
hydrogenation and CO hydrogenation reactions have been thoroughly reviewed [8,21,2731]. Much of the 
previous work focused on poisoning of nickel metal catalysts by H2S, the primary sulfur poison in 
many important catalytic processes, and thus provides some useful case studies of poisoning. 
Previous adsorption studies [2830] indicate that H2S adsorbs strongly and dissociatively on nickel 
metal surfaces. The high stability and low reversibility of adsorbed sulfur is illustrated by the data in 
Figure 4 [28], in which most of the previous equilibrium data for nickel are represented on a single 
plot of log (PH2S/PH2) versus reciprocal temperature. The solid line corresponds to the equilibrium data 
for formation of bulk Ni3S2. Based on the equation ΔG = RT ln(PH2S/PH2) = ΔH  TΔS, the slope of 
this line is ΔH/R, where ΔH = 75 kJ/mol and the intercept is ΔS/R. Most of the adsorption data lie 
between the dashed lines corresponding to ΔH = 125 and 165 kJ/mol for coverages ranging from 
0.5 to 0.9, indicating that adsorbed sulfur is more stable than the bulk sulfide. Indeed, extrapolation of 
high temperature data to zero coverage using a Tempkin isotherm [29] yields an enthalpy of adsorption 
of 250 kJ/mol; in other words, at low sulfur coverages, surface nickelsulfur bonds are a factor of 3 
more stable than bulk nickelsulfur bonds. It is apparent from Figure 4 that the absolute heat of 
adsorption increases with decreasing coverage and that the equilibrium partial pressure of H2S 
increases with increasing temperature and increasing coverage. For instance, at 725 K (450 C) and  
θ = 0.5, the values of PH2S/PH2 range from about 108 to 109. In other words, half coverage occurs at 
110 ppb H2S, a concentration range at the lower limit of our present analytical capability. At the same 
temperature (450 C), almost complete coverage (θ > 0.9) occurs at values of PH2S/PH2 of 107106 
(0.11 ppm) or at H2S concentrations encountered in many catalytic processes after the gas has been 
processed to remove sulfur compounds. These data are typical of sulfur adsorption on most catalytic 
metals. Thus, we can expect that H2S (and other sulfur impurities) will adsorb essentially irreversibly 
to high coverage in most catalytic processes involving metal catalysts. 
Two important keys to reaching a deeper understanding of poisoning phenomena include  
(1) determining surface structures of poisons adsorbed on metal surfaces and (2) understanding how 
surface structure and hence adsorption stoichiometry change with increasing coverage of the poison. 
Studies of structures of adsorbed sulfur on single crystal metals (especially Ni) [3,28,3238] provide 
such information. They reveal, for example, that sulfur adsorbs on Ni(100) in an ordered p(2 × 2) 
overlayer, bonded to four Ni atoms at S/Nis < 0.25 and in a c(2 × 2) overlayer to two Ni atoms for 
S/Nis = 0.250.50 (see Figure 5; Nis denotes a surface atom of Ni); saturation coverage of sulfur on 
Ni(100) occurs at S/Nis = 0.5. Adsorption of sulfur on Ni(110), Ni(111), and higher index planes of Ni 
is more complicated; while the same p(2 × 2) structure is observed at low coverage, complex 
overlayers appear at higher coveragesfor example, at S/Nis > 0.3 on Ni(111) a (5 3 2)S
 overlayer 
is formed [3234]. In more open surface structures, such as Ni(110) and Ni(210), saturation coverage 
occurs at S/Nis = 0.74 and 1.09 respectively; indeed, there is a trend of increasing S/Nis with 
decreasing planar density and increasing surface roughness for Ni, while the saturation sulfur 
concentration remains constant at 44 ng/cm2 Ni (see Table 5).

a Data from [35]. 
Reported saturation stoichiometries for sulfur adsorption on polycrystalline and supported Ni 
catalysts (S/Nis) vary from 0.25 to 1.3 [28]. The values of saturation coverage greater than S/Nis = 0.5 
may be explained by (1) a higher fractional coverage of sites of lower coordination number, i.e., atoms 
located on edges or corners of rough, high-index planes (Table 5); (2) enhanced adsorption capacity at 
higher gas phase concentrations of H2S in line with the observed trend of increasing saturation 
coverage with increasing H2S concentration in Figure 4; and/or (3) reconstruction of planar surfaces to 
rougher planes by adsorbed sulfur at moderately high coverages and adsorption temperatures. 
The first effect would be favored, and in fact is observed, for supported metals of higher dispersion [28]. 
The second effect may explain the typically lower observed values of S/Nis for single crystal Ni, which 
are measured at extremely low pressures (high vacuum) relative to the higher values of S/Nis for 
polycrystalline and supported Ni, typically measured at orders of magnitude higher pressure; thus, in 
the case of the single crystal studies, the surface is not in equilibrium with gas phase H2S/H2. 
The third effect, reconstruction of nickel surfaces by adsorbed sulfur, has been reported by a 
number of workers [28,32,33,3638]; for example, McCarroll and co-workers [37,38] found that sulfur 
adsorbed at near saturation coverage on a Ni(111) face was initially in a hexagonal pattern, but upon 
heating above 700 K reoriented to a distorted c(2 × 2) (100) overlayer. Oudar [36] reported that sulfur 
adsorbed on a Ni(810) surface caused decomposition to (100) and (410) facets. During adsorption of 
H2S at RT, Ruan et al. [33] observed surface restructuring of Ni(111) from a p(2 × 2) at low coverage 
to a missing-row (5 3 2)S
terrace structure (0.4 monolayer) sparsely covered with small, irregular 
islands composed of sulfur adsorbed on disordered nickel; upon annealing to 460 K for 5 min, the 
islands ordered to the (5 3 2)S
phase and their size increased, suggesting further diffusion of Ni 
atoms from the terraces. The reconstruction of Ni (111) involving ejection and migration of Ni atoms 
was attributed to compressive surface stresses induced by sulfur adsorption; the role of compressive 
surface stress due to sulfur coverages exceeding 0.3 was confirmed by Grossmann et al. [32]. From 
these and similar studies, it is concluded that at moderately high temperatures (300600 K) and 
coverages greater than 0.3, restructuring by sulfur of different facets of Ni to rougher, more open, 
stable structures is probably a general phenomenon. Thus, reconstruction probably accounts at least in 
part for observed increases in saturation S coverage with decreasing Ni site density. 
The nature of reconstruction of a surface by a poison may depend on its pretreatment. For example, 
in a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of room temperature H2S adsorption on Ni(110), 
Ruan and co-workers [40] found that the S/Ni structure at saturation varied with the initial state of the 
Catalysts 2015, 5

surface, i.e., whether clean or oxygen covered. Beginning with a clean Ni(110) surface, oxygen 
adsorbs dissociatively to form a (2 × 1)O overlayer at 1/2 monolayer coverage (Figure 6a); this is 
accompanied by a homogeneous nucleation of low-coordinated -Ni-O- rows along the [001] direction. 
As the oxygen-covered surface is exposed stepwise to 3 and then 8 Langmuirs (L) of H2S, oxygen 
atoms are removed by reaction with hydrogen to water; the surface is first roughened, after which 
white islands and black troughs having a c(2 × 2) structure are formed as sulfur atoms replace oxygen 
atoms (Figure 6b). Upon exposure to 25 L of H2S, the c(2 × 2) islands dissolve, while low-coordinated 
rows (periodicity of 1) form in the [001] direction, developing into ordered regions with a periodicity 
of 4 in the [1  0] direction (Figure 6c). After exposure to 50 L of H2S (Figure 6d), a stable,  
well-ordered (4 × 1)S structure appears, a surface clearly reconstructed relative to the original Ni(110). 
Moreover, the reconstructed surface in Figure 6d is very different from that observed upon direct 
exposure of the Ni(110) to H2S at room temperature, i.e., a c(2 × 2)S overlying the original Ni(110) 
(similar to Figure 5b); in other words, it appears that no reconstruction occurs by direct exposure to 
H2S at room temperature, rather only in the presence of O2 (or air). This emphasizes the complexities 
inherent in predicting the structure and stability of a given poison adsorbed on a given catalyst during a 
specified reaction as a function of different pretreatments or process disruptions, e.g., exposure to air. 
In the previous discussion of Figure 4, ΔHads was observed to decrease with increasing sulfur 
coverage; data in Figure 7 [41] show that ΔHads decreases with increasing gas-phase H2S 
concentration and coverage. However, in contrast to the data in Figure 4, those in Figure 7 [41] show 
that at very high H2S concentrations and high adsorption temperatures, ΔHads falls well below the  
ΔHformation of bulk Ni3S2; at the same time, the S/Nis ratio approaches that of Ni2S3. This is a unique 
result, since all of the data obtained at lower temperatures and H2S concentrations [28] show ΔHads to 
be greater than ΔHformation of Ni3S2.

From the above discussion, the structure and stoichiometry of sulfur adsorbed on nickel evidently 
are complex functions of temperature, H2S concentration, sulfur coverage, and pretreatment, 
phenomena that account at least in part for the complex nature of nickel poisoning by sulfur. Could 
one expect similar complexities in the poisoning of other metals? Probably, since poisoning of nickel 
is prototypical, i.e., similar principles operate and similar poisoning behaviors are observed in other 
poison/metal systems, although none have been studied to the same depth as sulfur/nickel. 
Since one of the necessary steps in a catalytic reaction is the adsorption of one or more reactants, 
investigation of the effects of adsorbed sulfur on the adsorption of other molecules, can provide useful 
insights into the poisoning process [21,28]. Previous investigations [28,4248] indicate that both H2 
and CO adsorptions on nickel are poisoned by adsorbed sulfur. For example, thermal desorption

studies of CO from presulfided Ni(100) [44] reveal a weakening of the CO adsorption bond and a 
rapid, nonlinear decline in the most strongly bound β2 state (bridged CO) with increasing sulfur 
coverage, corresponding to a poisoning of about 810 Ni atoms for bridged CO adsorption per 
adsorbed sulfur atom at low sulfur coverage (see Figure 8); moreover, the β2 CO species is completely 
poisoned at about 0.20.4 mL of sulfur relative to a saturation coverage of 0.5 mL. Hydrogen 
adsorption is poisoned in a similar nonlinear fashion. On the other hand, the coverage of the β1 state 
(linear CO) is constant with increasing sulfur coverage. The sharp nonlinear drop in CO and hydrogen 
adsorptions at low sulfur coverages has been interpreted in terms of a combination of short-range 
electronic and steric effects operating over a range of less than 5 atomic units [13]. The different 
effects of sulfur on β1 and β2 states of CO have important implications for sulfur poisoning in reactions 
involving CO; that is, sulfur poisoning can affect reaction selectivity as well as activity [28]. 
Because sulfur adsorbs so strongly on metals and prevents or modifies the further adsorption of 
reactant molecules, its presence on a catalyst surface usually effects substantial or complete loss of 
activity in many important reactions. This is illustrated by the data in Figure 9 showing the steady-state 
methanation activities of Ni, Co, Fe, and Ru relative to the fresh, unpoisoned surface activity as a 
function of gas phase H2S concentration. These data indicate that Ni, Co, Fe, and Ru all suffer 34 
orders of magnitude loss in activity at 15100 ppb of H2S, i.e., their sulfur tolerances are extremely 
low. Moreover, the sharp drop in activity with increasing H2S concentration suggests highly selective 
poisoning. Nevertheless, the rate of sulfur poisoning and hence sulfur resistance varies from catalyst to 
catalyst and is apparently a function of catalyst composition [28] and reaction conditions [49]. Indeed, 
it is possible to significantly improve sulfur resistance of Ni, Co, and Fe with catalyst additives such as 
Mo and B that selectively adsorb sulfur. Because the adsorption of sulfur compounds is generally rapid 
and irreversible, surface sulfur concentrations in catalyst particles and beds are nonuniform, e.g., H2S 
adsorbs selectively at the entrance to a packed bed and on the outer surface of catalyst particles, 
making the experimental study and modeling of sulfur poisoning extremely difficult. 
There are other complications in the study of sulfur poisoning. For example, the adsorption 
stoichiometry of sulfur in CO hydrogenation on Ni is apparently a function of the temperature, H2/CO 
ratio, and water partial pressure [49]. Moreover, at high CO partial pressures sulfur may be removed 
from the surface as COS, which is not as strongly adsorbed as H2S. At low temperature conditions, 
e.g., those representative of FischerTropsch synthesis or liquid phase hydrogenations, the gas phase 
concentration of H2S in poisoning studies must be kept very low, i.e., below 0.15 ppm, to avoid 
formation of bulk metal sulfidesa phenomenon that seriously compromises the validity of the 
results. Thus, the importance of studying poisoning phenomena in situ under realistic reaction 
conditions, at low process-relevant poison concentrations, and over a process-representative range of 
temperature and concentration conditions is emphasized. 
As mentioned earlier, there are a number of industrial processes in which one intentionally poisons 
the catalyst in order to improve its selectivity. For example, Pt-containing naphtha reforming catalysts 
are often pre-sulfided to minimize unwanted cracking reactions. On basic Pt/KL zeolite catalysts, these 
short term, low concentration exposures are beneficial to produce Pt ensemble sizes that promote 
aromatization, while longer term or higher concentration exposures poison the catalyst both by forming 
Pt-S bonds and producing large crystallites that block pores, as shown by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), and favor only

dehydrogenation [5053]. Other examples are sulfur added to Fischer-Tropsch catalysts that have been 
reported to have either beneficial or negligibly harmful effects, which are important considerations in 
setting the minimum gas clean-up requirements [27,30,5456]. S and P are added to Ni catalysts to 
improve isomerization selectivity in the fats and oils hydrogenation industry, while S and Cu are added 
to Ni catalysts in steam reforming to minimize coking. In catalytic reforming, sulfided Re or Sn is added 
to Pt to enhance the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins while poisoning hydrogenolysis/coking 
reactions. V2O5 is added to Pt to suppress SO2 oxidation to SO3 in diesel emissions control catalysts.

2.2. Fouling, Coking, and Carbon Deposition 
2.2.1. Fouling  
Fouling is the physical (mechanical) deposition of species from the fluid phase onto the catalyst surface, 
which results in activity loss due to blockage of sites and/or pores. In its advanced stages, it may result in 
disintegration of catalyst particles and plugging of the reactor voids. Important examples include 
mechanical deposits of carbon and coke in porous catalysts, although carbon- and coke-forming processes 
also involve chemisorption of different kinds of carbons or condensed hydrocarbons that may act as 
catalyst poisons. The definitions of carbon and coke are somewhat arbitrary and by convention related 
to their origin. Carbon is typically a product of CO disproportionation while coke is produced by 
decomposition or condensation of hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces and typically consists of 
polymerized heavy hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, coke forms may vary from high molecular weight 
hydrocarbons to primarily carbons such as graphite, depending upon the conditions under which the 
coke was formed and aged. A number of books and reviews treat the formation of carbons and coke on 
catalysts and the attendant deactivation of the catalysts [1,4,5762]. 
The chemical structures of cokes or carbons formed in catalytic processes vary with reaction type, 
catalyst type, and reaction conditions. Menon [62] suggested that catalytic reactions accompanied by 
carbon or coke formation can be broadly classified as either coke-sensitive or coke-insensitive, 
analogous to Boudarts more general classification of structure-sensitive and structure-insensitive 
catalytic reactions. In coke-sensitive reactions, unreactive coke is deposited on active sites, leading to 
activity decline, while in coke-insensitive reactions, relatively reactive coke precursors formed on 
active sites are readily removed by hydrogen (or other gasifying agents). Examples of coke-sensitive 
reactions include catalytic cracking and hydrogenolysis; on the other hand, FischerTropsch synthesis, 
catalytic reforming, and methanol synthesis are examples of coke-insensitive reactions. On the basis of 
this classification, Menon [62] reasoned that the structure and location of a coke are more important 
than its quantity in affecting catalytic activity. 
Consistent with Menons classification, it is also generally observed that not only structure and 
location of coke vary but also its mechanism of formation varies with catalyst type, e.g., whether it is a 
metal or metal oxide (or sulfide, sulfides being similar to oxides). Because of these significant 
differences in mechanism, formation of carbon and coke is discussed below separately for supported 
metals and for metal oxides and sulfides. 
2.2.2. Carbon and Coke Formation on Supported Metal Catalysts  
Possible effects of fouling by carbon (or coke) on the functioning of a supported metal catalyst are 
illustrated in Figure 10. Carbon may (1) chemisorb strongly as a monolayer or physically adsorb in 
multilayers and in either case block access of reactants to metal surface sites, (2) totally encapsulate a 
metal particle and thereby completely deactivate that particle, and (3) plug micro- and mesopores such 
that access of reactants is denied to many crystallites inside these pores. Finally, in extreme cases, 
strong carbon filaments may build up in pores to the extent that they stress and fracture the support 
material, ultimately causing the disintegration of catalyst pellets and plugging of reactor voids. For 
example, in steam methane reforming (SMR) catalysts, which are typically nickel supported on alumina 
Catalysts 2015, 5

with alkaline earth oxides, the carbon can diffuse through and begin to grow filaments from the back side 
of the nickel particles (structural type 3 in Table 6) especially at high reaction temperatures and low 
steam to methane ratios, which push the nickel particles off the support surface. Thermal or mechanical 
shock can then cause the carbon filaments to fall off the support, thus permanently deactivating the 
catalyst [8,60]. However, the behavior is complex because for other reaction conditions and other 
metals, the filaments may grow from the top surface of the metal particles or the carbon may diffuse 
into the metal and form bulk carbides [8]. 
An example of recent interest for biomass reactions that points to the complex interaction between 
the active metal and the support during carbon deposition is the steam reforming of light alcohols and 
other oxygenates, in which deactivation occurs primarily through coking. For traditional SMR 
catalysts (e.g., Ni/MgAl2O4) the coke is believed to originate primarily from alkene formation [63,64]. 
However, for the case of Ni/La2O3 catalysts, carbon appears to form at the interface between the active 
metal and the support to block the active phase [65]. 
Mechanisms of carbon deposition and coke formation on metal catalysts from carbon monoxide and 
hydrocarbons, including methane during SMR for hydrogen production [4,5761], are illustrated in 
Figures 11 and 12. Different kinds of carbon and coke that vary in morphology and reactivity are 
formed in these reactions (see Tables 6 and 7). For example, CO dissociates on metals to form Cα, an 
adsorbed atomic carbon; Cα can react to Cβ, a polymeric carbon film. The more reactive, amorphous 
forms of carbon formed at low temperatures (e.g., Cα and Cβ) are converted at high temperatures over a 
period of time to less reactive, graphitic forms [60]

It should also be emphasized that some forms of carbon result in loss of catalytic activity and some 
do not. For example, at low reaction temperatures (<300375 C) condensed polymer or β-carbon 
films and at high temperatures (>650 C) graphitic carbon films encapsulate the metal surfaces of 
methanation and steam reforming catalysts [60]. Deactivation of steam reforming catalysts at high 
reaction temperatures (500900 C) may be caused by precipitation of atomic (carbidic) carbon 
dissolved in the Ni surface layers to a depth of more than 5070 nm [62,66]. If it accumulates on the 
metal surface (at high or low temperatures), adsorbed atomic carbon can deactivate metal sites for 
adsorption and/or reaction. For example, Durer and co-workers [67] demonstrated that carbon atoms 
residing in the fourfold hollow sites of Rh(100) block the adsorption of hydrogen (and hence could 
block sites for hydrogenation). In the intermediate temperature range of 375650 C, carbon filaments 
(Figure 13) are formed by precipitation of dissolved carbon at the rear side of metal crystallites, 
causing the metal particles to grow away from the support [57]. Filament growth ceases when 
sufficient carbon accumulates on the free surface to cause encapsulation by a carbon layer; however, 
encapsulation of the metal particles does not occur if H2/CO or H2O/hydrocarbon ratios are sufficiently 
high. Thus, carbon filaments sometimes formed in CO hydrogenation or steam reforming of 
hydrocarbons would not necessarily cause a loss of intrinsic catalyst activity unless they are formed in 
sufficient quantities to cause plugging of the pores [60] or loss of metal occurs as the carbon fibers are 
removed during regeneration [68,69]. However, in practice, regions of carbon forming potential in 
steam reforming must be carefully avoided, since once initiated, the rates of filamentous carbon 
formation are sufficiently high to cause catastrophic pore plugging and catalyst failure within a few 
hours to days.

The rate at which deactivation occurs for a given catalyst and reaction depends greatly on reaction 
conditionsespecially temperature and reactant composition. A fundamental principle for coke-insensitive 
reactions on metals (e.g., methanation, FischerTropsch synthesis, steam reforming, catalytic 
reforming, and methanol synthesis) is that deactivation rate depends greatly on the difference in rates 
of formation and gasification of carbon/coke precursors, i.e., rd = rf  rg. If the rate of gasification, rg, is 
equal to or greater than that of formation, rf, carbon/coke is not deposited. Rates of carbon/coke 
precursor formation and gasification both increase exponentially with temperature, although the 
difference between them varies a great deal with temperature because of differences in preexponential 
factors and activation energies. Thus, carbon/coke formation is avoided in regions of temperature in 
which precursor gasification rate exceeds deposition rate. This is illustrated in Figure 14, an Arrhenius 
plot for rates of formation and hydrogenation of alpha and beta carbons on nickel during CO 
methanation. Since at temperatures below 600 K (1/T > 1.66 × 103 K1) the rate of Cα gasification 
exceeds that of Cα formation, no carbon is deposited. However above 600 K, Cα accumulates on the surface 
since the rate of Cα formation exceeds that of Cα gasification. As Cα accumulates (at 600700 K), it is 
converted to a Cβ polymeric chain or film that deactivates the nickel catalyst; however, above 700 K  
(1/T < 1.43 × 103 K1), the rate of Cβ hydrogenation exceeds that of formation and no deactivation 
occurs. Thus, the safe regions of methanation for avoiding deactivation by carbon are below 600 K and 
above 700 K; of course, these regions will vary somewhat with reactant concentrations and catalyst 
activity. A similar principle operates in steam reforming, i.e., at a sufficiently low reaction temperature, 
the rate of hydrocarbon adsorption exceeds the rate of hydrocracking and a deactivating polymer film is 
formed [70]; accordingly, it is necessary to operate above this temperature to avoid deactivation.

In steam reforming, filamentous carbon formation rate is a strong function of reactant hydrocarbon 
structure; for example, it decreases in the order acetylenes, olefins, paraffins, i.e., in order of 
decreasing reactivity, although activation energies for nickel are in the same range (125139 kJ) 
independent of hydrocarbon structure and about the same as those observed for formation of 
filamentous carbon from decomposition of CO [60]. This latter observation suggests that the reactions 
of CO and different hydrocarbons to filamentous carbon proceed by a common mechanism and  
rate-determining stepprobably the diffusion of carbon through the metal crystallites [60]. 
The rate at which a carbon or coke is accumulated in a given reaction under given conditions can vary 
significantly with catalyst structure, including metal type, metal crystallite size, promoter, and catalyst 
support. For example, supported Co, Fe, and Ni are active above 350400 C for filamentous carbon 
formation from CO and hydrocarbons; the order of decreasing activity is reportedly Fe > Co > Ni [60]. Pt, 
Ru, and Rh catalysts, on the other hand, while equally or more active than Ni, Co, or Fe in steam 
reforming, produce little or no coke or carbon. This is attributed to reduced mobility and/or solubility of 
carbon in the noble metals, thus retarding the nucleation process. Thus, it is not surprising that addition of 
noble metals to base metals retards carbon formation; for example, addition of Pt in Ni lowers carbon 
deposition rate during methanation, while addition of Cu or Au to Ni substantially lowers carbon formation 
in steam reforming [60,71]. In contrast to the moderating effects of noble metal additives, addition of 0.5% 
Sn to cobalt substantially increases the rate of carbon filament formation from ethylene [72], an effect 
desirable in the commercial production of carbon filament fibers. 
Since carbon formation and gasification rates are influenced differently by modifications in metal 
crystallite surface chemistry, which are in turn a function of catalyst structure, oxide additives or oxide 
supports may be used to moderate the rate of undesirable carbon or coke accumulation. For example, 
Bartholomew and Strasburg [73] found the specific rate (turnover frequency) of filamentous carbon 
deposition on nickel during methanation at 350 C to decrease in the order Ni/TiO2 > NiAl2O3 > 
Ni/SiO2, while Vance and Bartholomew [74] observed Cα hydrogenation rates at 170 C to decrease in 
this same order (the same as for methanation at 225 C). This behavior was explained in terms of 
promotional or inhibiting effects due to decoration of metal crystallites by the support, for example 
Catalysts 2015, 5 
 
165 
 
silica, inhibiting both CO dissociation and carbon hydrogenation. This hypothesis is consistent with 
observations [75,76] that silica evaporated on metal surfaces and supported metals inhibits formation 
of filamentous carbon. Similarly Bitter and co-workers [77] observed rates of carbon formation in 
CO2/CH4 reforming to decrease in the order Pt/γ-Al2O3Pt/TiO2 > Pt/ZrO2; while 90% of the carbon 
deposited on the support, the authors linked deactivation to carbon accumulated on the metal owing to 
an imbalance between carbon formed by methane dissociation and oxidation by chemisorbed CO2. The 
rate of formation of coke in steam reforming is delayed and occurs at lower rates in nickel catalysts 
promoted with alkali or supported on basic MgO [78]. 
Since formation of coke, graphite, or filamentous carbon involves the formation of C-C bonds on 
multiple atoms sites, one might expect that coke or carbon formation on metals is structure-sensitive, i.e., 
sensitive to surface structure and metal crystallite size. Indeed, Bitter and co-workers [77] found that 
catalysts containing larger Pt crystallites deactivate more rapidly than those containing small crystallites. 
Moreover, a crystallite size effect, observed in steam reforming of methane on nickel [60,78], appears to 
operate in the same direction, i.e., formation of filamentous carbon occurs at lower rates in catalysts 
containing smaller metal crystallites. 
In summary, deactivation of supported metals by carbon or coke may occur chemically, owing to 
chemisorption or carbide formation, or physically and mechanically, owing to blocking of surface 
sites, metal crystallite encapsulation, plugging of pores, and destruction of catalyst pellets by carbon 
filaments. Blocking of catalytic sites by chemisorbed hydrocarbons, surface carbides, or relatively reactive 
films is generally reversible in hydrogen, steam, CO2, or oxygen. Further details of the thermodynamics, 
kinetics, and mechanisms of carbon and coke formation in methanation and steam reforming reactions are 
available in reviews by Bartholomew [60] and Rostrup-Nielsen [70,78]. In recent reviews addressing 
deactivation of Co catalysts by carbon during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [79,80], the same or similar 
carbon species, e.g., α, β, polymeric, and graphitic carbons, are observed on Co surfaces as on Ni; 
moreover, poisoning or fouling of the Co surfaces with β, polymeric, and graphitic carbon layers are 
found to be major causes of deactivation.  
2.2.3. Coke Formation on Metal Oxide and Sulfide Catalysts 
In reactions involving hydrocarbons, coke may be formed in the gas phase and on both noncatalytic and 
catalytic surfaces. Nevertheless, formation of coke on oxides and sulfides is principally a result of cracking 
reactions involving coke precursors (typically olefins or aromatics) catalyzed by acid sites [81,82]. 
Dehydrogenation and cyclization reactions of carbocation intermediates formed on acid sites lead to 
aromatics, which react further to higher molecular weight polynuclear aromatics that condense as coke 
(see Figure 15). Reactions 13 in Figure 15 illustrate the polymerization of olefins, reactions 48 
illustrate cyclization from olefins, and reactions 914 illustrate chain reaction formation of polynuclear 
aromatics that condense as coke on the catalyst surface. Because of the high stability of the 
polynuclear carbocations (formed in reactions 1013), they can continue to grow on the surface for a 
relatively long time before a termination reaction occurs through the back donation of a proton. 
From this mechanistic scheme (Figure 15), it is clear that olefins, benzene and benzene derivatives, 
and polynuclear aromatics are precursors to coke formation. However, the order of reactivity for coke 
formation is clearly structure dependent, i.e., decreases in the order polynuclear aromatics > aromatics 
Catalysts 2015, 5 
 
166 
 
> olefins > branched alkanes > normal alkanes. For example, the weight percent coke formed on  
silicaalumina at 500 C is 0.06, 3.8, 12.5, and 23% for benzene, naphthalene, fluoranthene, and 
anthracene respectively [83]. 
Coking reactions in processes involving heavy hydrocarbons are very complex; different kinds of 
coke may be formed and they may range in composition from CH to C and have a wide range of 
reactivities with oxygen and hydrogen, depending upon the time on stream and temperature to which 
they are exposed. For example, coke deposits occurring in hydrodesulfurization of residuum have been 
classified into three types [84]: 
(1) 
Type I deposits are reversibly adsorbed normal aromatics deposited during the first part of 
the cycle at low temperature. 
(2) 
Type II deposits are reversibly adsorbed asphaltenes deposited early in the coking process. 
(3) 
Type III deposits result from condensation of aromatic concentrates into clusters and then 
crystals that constitute a mesophase. This crystalline phase is formed after long reaction times 
at high temperature. This hardened coke causes severe deactivation of the catalyst [84].

In addition to hydrocarbon structure and reaction conditions, extent and rate of coke formation are 
also a function of the acidity and pore structure of the catalyst. Generally, the rate and extent of coke 
formation increase with increasing acid strength and concentration. Coke yield decreases with 
decreasing pore size (for a fixed acid strength and concentration); this is especially true in zeolites 
where shape selectivity plays an important role in coke formation. For example, coke yield in fluid 
catalytic cracking is only 0.4% for ZSM-5 (pore diameters of 0.54 × 0.56 nm) compared to 2.2% for 
Y-faujasite (aperture diameter of 0.72 nm) [82]. However, in pores of molecular diameter, a relatively 
small quantity of coke can cause substantial loss of activity. It should be emphasized that coke yield 
can vary considerably into the interior pores of a catalyst particle or along a catalyst bed, depending 
upon the extent to which the main and deactivation reactions are affected by film mass transport and 
pore diffusional resistance. 
The mechanisms by which coke deactivates oxide and sulfide catalysts are, as in the case of 
supported metals, both chemical and physical. However, some aspects of the chemistry are quite 
different. The principal chemical loss of activity in oxides and sulfides is due to the strong adsorption 
of coke molecules on acidic sites. However, as discussed earlier, strong acid sites also play an 
important role in the formation of coke precursors, which subsequently undergo condensation 
reactions to produce large polynuclear aromatic molecules that physically coat catalytic surfaces. 
Physical loss of activity also occurs as coke accumulates, ultimately partially or completely blocking 
catalyst pores as in supported metal catalysts. For example, in isomerization of cis-butene on 
SiO2/Al2O3 [85] catalyst deactivation occurs by rapid, selective poisoning of strong acid sites; coke 
evolved early in the reaction is soluble in dichloromethane and pyridine and is slightly aromatic. 
Apparently, the blocking of active sites does not significantly affect porosity or catalyst surface area, 
as SiO2/Al2O3 contains relatively large mesopores. 
In the case of supported bifunctional metal/metal oxide catalysts, different kinds of coke are formed 
on the metal and the acidic oxide support, e.g., soft coke (high H/C ratio) on Pt or PtRe metals and 
hard coke (low H/C ratio) on the alumina support in catalytic reforming [86]. In this case, coke 
precursors may be formed on the metal via hydrogenolysis, following which they migrate to the 
support and undergo polymerization and cyclization reactions, after which the larger molecules are 
dehydrogenated on the metal and finally accumulate on the support, causing loss of isomerization 
activity. Mild sulfiding of these catalysts (especially PtRe/alumina) substantially reduces the rate of 
hydrogenolysis and the overall formation of coke on both metal and support; it especially reduces the 
hard coke, which is mainly responsible for deactivation. 
Several recent studies [82,8797] have focused on coke formation during hydrocarbon reactions in 
zeolites including (1) the detailed chemistry of coke precursors and coke molecules formed in zeolite 
pores and pore intersections (or supercages) and (2) the relative importance of adsorption on acid sites 
versus pore blockage. The principal conclusions from these studies can be summarized as follows:  
(1) the formation of coke and the manner in which it deactivates a zeolite catalyst are shape-selective 
processes, (2) deactivation is mainly due to the formation and retention of heavy aromatic clusters in 
pores and pore intersections, and (3) while both acid-site poisoning and pore blockage participate in 
the deactivation, the former dominates at low coking rates, low coke coverages (e.g., in Y-zeolite 
below 2 wt%), and high temperatures, while the latter process dominates at high reaction rates, high 
Catalysts 2015, 5 
 
169 
 
coke coverages, and low temperatures. Thus, pore size and pore structure are probably more important than 
acid strength and density under typical commercial process conditions. Indeed, deactivation is typically 
more rapid in zeolites having small pores or apertures and/or a monodimensional structure [95]. Figure 16 
illustrates four possible modes of deactivation of HZSM-5 by carbonaceous deposits with increasing 
severity of coking [95]. 
 
Figure 16. Schematic of the four possible modes of deactivation by carbonaceous deposits in 
HZSM-5: (1) reversible adsorption on acid sites, (2) irreversible adsorption on sites with partial 
blocking of pore intersections, (3) partial steric blocking of pores, and (4) extensive steric 
blocking of pores by exterior deposits. Adapted from [95]. 
These conclusions (in the previous paragraph) are borne out, for example, in the study by Cerqueira 
and co-workers [97] of USHY zeolite deactivation during methylcyclohexane transformation at 450 C, 
showing the following: 
(1) 
Coke is probably mainly formed by rapid transformation of toluenic C7 carbenium ions 
with lesser contributions from reactions of cyclopentadiene, C3C6 olefins, and aromatics. 
(2) 
Soluble coke consists of polynuclear aromatic clusters containing three to seven five- and 
six-membered rings having a typical compositions of C30H40 to C40H44 and having 
dimensions of 0.9 × 1.1 nm to 1.1 × 1.5 nm, i.e., sizes that would cause them to be trapped 
in the supercages of Y-zeolite. 
(3) 
At short contact times, coking is relatively slow and deactivation is mainly due to acid-site 
poisoning, while at long contact times, coking is much faster because of the high concentrations 
of coke precursors; under these latter conditions coke is preferentially deposited at the outer 
pore openings of zeolite crystallites and deactivation is dominated by pore-mouth blockage. 
That coke formed at large contact times not only blocks pores and/or pore intersections inside the 
zeolite, but also migrates to the outside of zeolite crystallites, where it blocks pore entrances, has been 
observed in several studies [91,93,94,97]. However, the amount, structure, and location of coke in 
ZSM-5 depends strongly on the coke precursor, e.g., coke formed from mesitylene is deposited on the 
external zeolite surface, whereas coking with isobutene leads to largely paraffinic deposits inside

internal zeolite surfaces [91]. 
2.3. Thermal Degradation and Sintering 
2.3.1. Background 
Thermally induced deactivation of catalysts results from (1) loss of catalytic surface area due to 
crystallite growth of the catalytic phase, (2) loss of support area due to support collapse and of catalytic 
surface area due to pore collapse on crystallites of the active phase, and/or (3) chemical transformations of 
catalytic phases to noncatalytic phases. The first two processes are typically referred to as sintering. The 
third is discussed in the next section under solidsolid reactions. Sintering processes generally take place at 
high reaction temperatures (e.g., > 500 C) and are generally accelerated by the presence of water vapor. 
Most of the previous sintering and redispersion work has focused on supported metals. 
Experimental and theoretical studies of sintering and redispersion of supported metals published before 
1997 have been reviewed fairly extensively [8,98107]. Three principal mechanisms of metal 
crystallite growth have been advanced: (1) crystallite migration, (2) atomic migration, and (3) (at very 
high temperatures) vapor transport. The processes of crystallite and atomic migration are illustrated in 
Figure 17. Crystallite migration involves the migration of entire crystallites over the support surface, 
followed by collision and coalescence. Atomic migration involves detachment of metal atoms or 
molecular metal clusters from crystallites, migration of these atoms over the support surface, and 
ultimately, capture by larger crystallites. Redispersion, the reverse of crystallite growth in the presence 
of O2 and/or Cl2, may involve (1) formation of volatile metal oxide or metal chloride complexes that 
attach to the support and are subsequently decomposed to small crystallites upon reduction and/or  
(2) formation of oxide particles or films that break into small crystallites during subsequent reduction.

migration or (B) crystallite migration. Reproduced from [8], Copyright 2006, Wiley-Interscience. 
There is controversy in the literature regarding which mechanism of sintering (or redispersion) 
operates at a given set of conditions. Logically, atomic migration would be favored at lower 
temperatures than crystallite migration, since the higher diffusivities of atoms or small cluster would 
facilitate their migration, whereas the thermal energy necessary to induce motion of larger crystallites 
would only be available at higher temperatures. Moreover, migration of small crystallites might be 
favorable early in the sintering process but unfavorable as crystallites become larger. However, 
Catalysts 2015, 5 
 
171 
 
focusing on only one of the three sintering mechanisms (and two dispersion mechanisms) is a 
simplification that ignores the possibility that all mechanisms may occur simultaneously and may be 
coupled with each other through complex physicochemical processes, including the following:  
(1) dissociation and emission of metal atoms or metal-containing molecules from metal crystallites,  
(2) adsorption and trapping of metal atoms or metal-containing molecules on the support surface,  
(3) diffusion of metal atoms, metal-containing molecules and/or metal crystallites across support 
surfaces, (4) metal or metal oxide particle spreading, (5) support surface wetting by metal particles,  
(6) metal particle nucleation, (7) coalescence of, or bridging between, two metal particles, (8) capture 
of atoms or molecules by metal particles, (9) liquid formation, (10) metal volatilization through 
volatile compound formation, (11) splitting of crystallites in O2 atmosphere owing to formation of 
oxides of a different specific volume, and (12) metal atom vaporization. Depending upon reaction or 
redispersion conditions, a few or all of these processes may be important; thus, the complexity of 
sintering/redispersion processes is emphasized. 
In general, thermal sintering processes are kinetically slow (at moderate reaction temperatures) and 
irreversible or difficult to reverse. Thus, sintering is more easily prevented than cured. 
2.3.2. Factors Affecting Metal Particle Growth and Redispersion in Supported Metals 
Temperature, atmosphere, metal type, metal dispersion, promoters/impurities, and support surface area, 
texture, and porosity are the principal parameters affecting rates of sintering and redispersion (see Table 8) 
[8,103107]. Sintering rates increase exponentially with temperature. Metals sinter relatively rapidly in 
oxygen and relatively slowly in hydrogen, although depending upon the support, metal redispersion can be 
facilitated by exposure at high temperature (e.g., 500550 C for Pt/Al2O3) to oxygen and chlorine, 
followed by reduction. Water vapor also increases the sintering rate of supported metals, likely through 
chemical-assisted sintering effects similar to those described in Section 2.4.3. 
Table 8. Effects of Important Reaction and Catalyst Variables on Sintering Rates of 
Supported Metals Based on General Power-Law Expression (GPLE) Data a. 
Variable 
Effect 
Temperature 
Sintering rates are exponentially dependent on T; Eact varies from 30 to 150 kJ/mol. Eact 
decreases with increasing metal loading; it increases in the following order with 
atmosphere: NO < O2 < H2 < N2 
Atmosphere 
Sintering rates are much higher for noble metals in O2 than in H2 and higher for noble 
and base metals in H2 relative to N2. Sintering rate decreases for supported Pt in 
atmospheres in the following order: NO > O2 > H2 > N2 
Metal 
Observed order of decreasing thermal stability in H2 is Ru > Ir Rh > Pt; thermal 
stability in O2 is a function of (1) volatility of metal oxide and (2) strength of metal 
oxidesupport interaction 
Support 
Metalsupport interactions are weak (bond strengths of 515 kJ/mol); with a few 
exceptions, thermal stability for a given metal decreases with support in the following 
order: Al2O3 > SiO2 > carbon 
Promoters 
Some additives decrease atom mobility, e.g., C, O, CaO, BaO, CeO2, GeO2; others 
increase atom mobility, e.g., Pb, Bi, Cl, F, or S. Oxides of Ba, Ca, or Sr are trapping 
agents that decrease sintering rate 
Pore size 
Sintering rates are lower for porous versus nonporous supports; they decrease as 
crystallite diameters approach those of the pores 
a Refs. [8,103107]. For the definition of a GPLE, see Equation 2 later in this section. 
Catalysts 2015, 5

Normalized dispersion (percentage of metal exposed at any time divided by the initial percentage 
exposed) versus time data in Figure 18 show that at temperatures of 650 C or higher, rates of metal 
surface area loss (measured by hydrogen chemisorption) due to sintering of Ni/silica in hydrogen 
atmosphere are significant, causing 70% loss of the original metal surface area within 50 h at 750 C. 
In reducing atmosphere, metal crystallite stability generally decreases with decreasing metal melting 
temperature, i.e., in the order Ru > Ir > Rh > Pt > Pd > Ni > Cu > Ag, although this order may be 
affected by relatively stronger metalsupport interactions, e.g., the observed order of decreasing 
stability of supported platinum in vacuum is Pt/Al2O3 > Pt/SiO2 > Pt/C. In oxidizing atmospheres, 
metal crystallite stability depends on the volatility of metal oxides and the strength of the metaloxide
support interaction. For noble metals, metal stability in air decreases in the order Rh > Pt > Ir > Ru; 
formation of volatile RuO4 accounts for the relative instability of ruthenium.

The effect of temperature on sintering of metals and oxides can be understood physically in terms 
of the driving forces for dissociation and diffusion of surface atoms, which are both proportional to the 
fractional approach to the absolute melting point temperature (Tmp). Thus, as temperature increases, the 
mean lattice vibration of surface atoms increases; when the Httig temperature (0.3Tmp) is reached, less 
strongly bound surface atoms at defect sites (e.g., edges and corner sites) dissociate and diffuse readily 
over the surface, while at the Tamman temperature (0.5Tmp), atoms in the bulk become mobile. 
Accordingly, sintering rates of a metal or metal oxide are significant above the Httig temperature and 
very high near the Tamman temperature; thus, the relative thermal stability of metals or metal oxides 
can be correlated in terms of the Httig or Tamman temperatures [109]. This can be illustrated from 
values of the melting and Tamman temperatures for noble and base metals and their compounds listed 
in Table 9. For example, sintering of copper catalysts for methanol synthesis is promoted by traces of 
chlorine in the feed, which react at about 225 C (500 K) with the active metal/metal oxide surface to 
produce a highly mobile copper chloride phase having a Tamman temperature of only 79174 C  
(352447 K) relative to 405527 C (678800 K) for copper metal or metal oxides [110].

Promoters or impurities affect sintering and redispersion by either increasing (e.g., chlorine and 
sulfur) or decreasing (e.g., oxygen, calcium, cesium) metal atom mobility on the support; in the latter 
case, this is due to their high resistance to dissociation and migration due to high melting points, as 
well as their hindering dissociation and surface diffusion of other atoms. Similarly, support surface 
defects or pores impede surface migration of metal particlesespecially micropores and mesopores 
with pore diameters about the same size as the metal crystallites. 
Historically, sintering rate data were fitted to a simple power-law expression (SPLE) of the form

where ks is the sintering rate constant, D0 the initial dispersion, and n is the sintering order, which for 
typical catalyst systems may vary from 3 to 15; unfortunately, the SPLE is, in general, not valid for

sintering processes because it assumes that surface area or dispersion ultimately reaches zero, given 
sufficient time, when in fact, for a given temperature and atmosphere, a nonzero or limiting dispersion 
is observed after long sintering times. Moreover, the use of the SPLE is further questionable because 
variations in sintering order are observed as a function of time and temperature for a given catalyst in a 
fixed atmosphere [105107]; thus, data obtained for different samples and different reaction conditions 
cannot be quantitatively compared. Nevertheless, it has been shown by Fuentes [111,112] and 
Bartholomew [104106] that the effects of temperature, atmosphere, metal, promoter, and support can be 
quantitatively determined by fitting sintering kinetic data to the general power-law expression (GPLE) 
 
(2) 
which adds a term Deq/D0 to account for the observed asymptotic approach of the typical dispersion 
versus time curve to a limiting dispersion Deq at infinite time; m, the order of sintering, is found to be 
either 1 or 2. A recently compiled, comprehensive quantitative treatment of previous sintering rate data 
based on the GPLE with an order m of 2 [104106] quantitatively addresses the effects of catalyst 
properties and reaction conditions on sintering rate. Some of these data are summarized in Table 10 
[108,113115]. These data show, for example, that the rate constant, and hence the rate of sintering, is 
less for Ni/Al2O3 than for Pt/Al2O3, an unexpected result in view of the lower heat of vaporization for 
Ni. This result is possibly explained by a greater metal support interaction for Ni with alumina.

Sintering studies of supported metals are generally of two types: (1) studies of commercially 
relevant supported metal catalysts and (2) studies of model metalsupport systems. The former type 
provides useful rate data that can be used to predict sintering rates, while the latter type provides 
insights into the mechanisms of metal particle migration and sintering, although the results cannot be 
quantitatively extrapolated to predict behavior of commercial catalysts. There is direct evidence from 
the previous studies of model-supported catalysts [104,107] for the occurrence of crystallite migration 
(mainly in well-dispersed systems early in the sintering process), atomic migration (mainly at longer 
Catalysts 2015, 5 
 
175 
 
sintering times), and spreading of metal crystallites (mainly in oxygen atmosphere). There is also 
evidence that under reaction conditions, the surface is dynamic, i.e., adsorbates and other adatoms 
rapidly restructure the surface and slowly bring about faceting; moreover, thermal treatments cause 
gradual changes in the distribution of coordination sites to minimize surface energy. There is a trend in 
increasing sophistication of spectroscopic tools used to study sintering and redispersion. In the next 
decade, we might expect additional insights into atomic and molecular processes during reaction at the 
atomic scale using STM, analytical high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and 
other such powerful surface science tools. 
2.3.3. Sintering of Catalyst Carriers 
Sintering of carriers (supports) has been reviewed by Baker and co-workers [103] and Trimm [116]. 
Single-phase oxide carriers sinter by one or more of the following processes: (1) surface diffusion,  
(2) solid-state diffusion, (3) evaporation/condensation of volatile atoms or molecules, (4) grain 
boundary diffusion, and (5) phase transformations. In oxidizing atmospheres, γ-alumina and silica are 
the most thermally stable carriers; in reducing atmospheres, carbons are the most thermally stable 
carriers. Additives and impurities affect the thermal properties of carriers by occupying defect sites or 
forming new phases. Alkali metals, for example, accelerate sintering; while calcium, barium, nickel, 
and lanthanum oxides form thermally stable spinel phases with alumina. Steam accelerates support 
sintering by forming mobile surface hydroxyl groups that are subsequently volatilized at higher 
temperatures. Chlorine also promotes sintering and grain growth in magnesia and titania during high 
temperature calcination. This is illustrated in Figure 19 [117]. By contrast, sulfuric acid treatment of 
hydrated alumina (gibbsite) followed by two-step calcination, results in a very stable transitional 
alumina with needle-like particle morphology [116]. Dispersed metals in supported metal catalysts can 
also accelerate support sintering; for example, dispersed nickel accelerates the loss of Al2O3 surface 
area in Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. 
As an important example of support sintering through phase transformations, Al2O3 has a rich phase 
behavior as a function of temperature and preparation. A few among the many important phases that 
are stable or metastable, include boehmite, γ-alumina, and α-alumina [8,118,119]. Other phases are 
possible and the temperatures at which the phase transitions occur depend on crystal size and moisture 
content of the starting material, but as an example, as temperature is raised, boehmite, which is a 
hydrated or hydroxyl form of alumina, transforms to γ-alumina between 300 and 450 C, then to  
δ-alumina at 850C, θ-alumina at 1000C, and finally α-alumina at 1125 C. The corresponding 
crystal structures for these five phases are orthorhombic, cubic defective spinel, orthorhombic, 
deformed monoclinic spinel, and hexagonal close pack (hcp with ABAB stacking) [8,118,119]. The 
approximate surface areas of these respective phases, as measured by nitrogen physisorption using 
Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) analysis, are approximately 400, 200, 120, 50, and 1 m2/g [8]. The 
dramatic drop in surface area during the transition from θ to α is associated with collapse of the 
microporous structure and formation of the dense hcp phase.

2.3.4. Effects of Sintering on Catalyst Activity  
Baker and co-workers [103] have reviewed the effects of sintering on catalytic activity. Specific activity 
(based on catalytic surface area) can either increase or decrease with increasing metal crystallite size during 
sintering if the reaction is structure-sensitive, or it can be independent of changes in metal crystallite size if 
the reaction is structure-insensitive. Thus, for a structure-sensitive reaction, the impact of sintering may be 
either magnified or moderated; while for a structure insensitive-reaction, sintering has in principle no 
effect on specific activity (per unit surface area). In the latter case, the decrease in mass-based activity is 
proportional to the decrease in metal surface area. Ethane hydrogenolysis and ethane steam reforming are 
examples of structure-sensitive reactions, while CO hydrogenation on supported cobalt, nickel, iron, and 
ruthenium is largely structure-insensitive in catalysts of moderate loading and dispersion. 
2.4. Gas/VaporSolid and Solid-State Reactions 
In addition to poisoning, there are a number of chemical routes leading to catalyst deactivation:  
(1) reactions of the vapor phase with the catalyst surface to produce (a) inactive bulk and surface 
phases (rather than strongly adsorbed species), (b) volatile compounds that exit the catalyst and reactor 
in the vapor phase, or (c) sintering due to adsorbate interactions, that we call chemical-assisted 
sintering to distinguish it from thermal sintering previously discussed; (2) catalytic solid-support or 
catalytic solid-promoter reactions, and (3) solid-state transformations of the catalytic phases during 
reaction. Each of these routes is discussed in some detail below. 
2.4.1. Gas/VaporSolid Reactions 
2.4.1.1. Reactions of Gas/Vapor with Solid to Produce Inactive Phases 
Dispersed metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal carbides are typical catalytic phases, the 
surfaces of which are similar in composition to the bulk phases. For a given reaction, one of these 
catalyst types is generally substantially more active than the others, e.g., only Fe and Ru metals are 
active for ammonia synthesis, while the oxides, sulfides, and carbides are inactive. If, therefore, one of 
these metal catalysts is oxidized, sulfided, or carbided, it will lose essentially all of its activity. While 
these chemical modifications are closely related to poisoning, the distinction here is that rather than 
losing activity owing to the presence of an adsorbed species, the loss of activity is due to the formation 
of a new phase altogether. 
Examples of vapor-induced chemical transformations of catalysts to inactive phases are listed in 
Table 11 [8,120127]. These include the formation of RhAl2O4 in the three-way PtRh/Al2O3 catalyst 
during high temperature operation in an auto exhaust; oxidation of Fe by low levels of O2 during 
ammonia synthesis or by H2O during regeneration; dealumination (migration of Al from the zeolite 
framework) of Y-zeolite during high temperature catalytic cracking and regeneration in steam; reaction 
of SO3 with the alumina support to form aluminum sulfate leading to support breakdown and catalyst 
pore plugging in several processes, including CO oxidation in a gas turbine exhaust, conversion of CO 
and hydrocarbons in a diesel exhaust converter, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx in utility 
boiler flue gases [8,122124,127]; oxidation of Fe5C2 to Fe3O4 and of Co metal supported on alumina or 
Catalysts 2015, 5

silica to Co surface aluminates or silicates during FischerTropsch synthesis at high conversions and hence 
high PH2O; and formation of NiAl2O4 during reaction and steam regeneration of Ni/Al2O3 in a slightly 
oxidizing atmosphere above about 500 C, especially if more reactive aluminas, e.g., γ, δ, or θ forms, are 
used as supports. Because reaction of SO3 with γ-Al2O3 to produce Al2(SO4)3 is a serious cause of 
deactivation of alumina-supported catalysts in several catalytic processes (e.g., diesel exhaust abatement and 
SCR), TiO2 or SiO2 carriers are used rather than Al2O3 or in the diesel or automotive exhaust the alumina 
catalyst is stabilized by addition of BaO, SrO, or ZrO2 [8,122127].

2.4.1.2. Reactions of Gas/Vapor with Solid to Produce Volatile Compounds 
Metal loss through direct vaporization is generally an insignificant route to catalyst deactivation. By 
contrast, metal loss through formation of volatile compounds, e.g., metal carbonyls, oxides, sulfides, 
and halides in CO, O2, H2S, and halogen-containing environments, can be significant over a wide 
range of conditions, including relatively mild conditions. Classes and examples of volatile compounds 
are listed in Table 12. Carbonyls are formed at relatively low temperatures but high pressures of CO; 
halides can be formed at relatively low temperatures and low concentration of the halogens. However, 
the conditions under which volatile oxides are formed vary considerably with the metal; for example, 
RuO3 can be formed at room temperature, while PtO2 is formed at measurable rates only at 
temperatures exceeding about 500 C.

While the chemical properties of volatile metal carbonyls, oxides, and halides are well known, there 
is surprisingly little information available on their rates of formation during catalytic reactions. There 
have been no reviews on this subject and relatively few reported studies to define the effects of metal 
loss on catalytic activity [28,128141]. Most of the previous work has focused on volatilization of Ru in 
automotive converters [128131]; nickel carbonyl formation in nickel catalysts during methanation of  
CO [133,139] or during CO chemisorption at 25 C [28,135], and formation of Ru carbonyls during 
FischerTropsch synthesis [136,137]; volatilization of Pt during ammonia oxidation on PtRh gauze 
catalysts [140,141]; and volatilization of Cu from methanol synthesis and diesel soot oxidation catalysts, 
leading to sintering in the former and better catalystsoot contact but also metal loss in the latter case [109]. 
Results of selected studies are summarized in Table 13. Bartholomew [131] found evidence of 
significant (50%) Ru loss after testing of a PdRu catalyst in an actual reducing automobile exhaust for 
100 h, which he attributed to formation of a volatile ruthenium oxide and which was considered 
responsible at least in part for a significant loss (20%) of NO reduction activity.

Ni(CO)4 formation, diffusion, and decomposition on the support as large crystallites; under severe 
conditions (very high PCO and relatively low reaction temperatures) loss of nickel metal occurs. Thus, 
loss of nickel and crystallite growth could be serious problems at the entrance to methanation reactors 
where the temperature is low enough and PCO high enough for metal carbonyl formation. Agnelli and 
co-workers [139] investigated kinetics and modeling of sintering due to formation and migration of 
nickel carbonyl species. They found that the initially sharp crystallite size distribution evolved during 
several hours of sintering under low temperature (230 C) reaction conditions to a bimodal system 
consisting of small spherical crystallites and large faceted crystals favoring (111) planes. The sintering 
process was modeled in terms of an Ostwald-ripening mechanism coupled with mass transport of 
mobile subcarbonyl intermediates. Long-term simulations were found to predict reasonably well the 
ultimate state of the catalyst. On the basis of their work, they proposed two solutions for reducing loss 
of nickel: (1) increasing reaction temperature and decreasing CO partial pressure in order to lower the 
rate of carbonyl formation, and (2) changing catalyst composition, e.g., alloying nickel with copper or 
adding alkali to inhibit carbonyl species migration. 
Of note, Kuo and Hwang have shown that the particle morphology itself affects the rate of Ostwald 
ripening due to different relative chemical potential energies of the surfaces [144]. Using silver 
nanoparticles, they found that atoms at sharp edges and corners were removed first, resulting in more 
rounded particles for all starting geometries. Thus, initial particle geometry appears to have an effect in 
addition to the chemical atmosphere experienced by the particles. 
Loss of nickel metal during CO chemisorption on nickel catalysts at temperatures above 0 C is also 
a serious problem; moreover, this loss is catalyzed by sulfur poisoning [28]. In view of the toxicity of 
nickel tetracarbonyl, the rapid loss of nickel metal, and the ill-defined adsorption stoichiometries, 
researchers are advised to avoid using CO chemisorption for measuring nickel surface areas; instead, 
hydrogen chemisorption, an accepted ASTM method with a well-defined adsorption stoichiometry, is 
recommended [145]. Figure 20 illustrates a mechanism for the formation of Ni(CO)4 on a crystallite of 
nickel in CO atmosphere.

Goodwin and co-workers [136,137] studied the influence of reaction atmosphere, support, and 
metal particle size on the loss of Ru due to carbonyl formation. They found that the loss of Ru during 
CO hydrogenation (H2/CO = 1, 200250 C, 1 atm) on Ru/NaY zeolite and Ru/Al2O3 for extended 
periods of time was significant (e.g., up to 40% while flowing CO at 175275 C over Ru/Al2O3 for  
24 h). The loss of Ru was significantly less on titania-supported Ru; moreover, the rate of loss was 
lower for catalysts containing large metal crystallites (3 nm) relative to those containing small metal 
crystallites (1.3 nm). Metal loss was inhibited in part at higher reaction temperatures as a result of 
carbon deposition. Thus, while it is clear that loss of ruthenium could be a serious problem in  
FischerTropsch synthesis, there are measures in terms of catalyst design and choice of reaction 
conditions that can be taken to minimize loss. 
One of the most dramatic examples of vapor phase loss of the catalyst occurs during NH3 oxidation 
on PtRh gauze, an important reaction in the manufacture of nitric acid [8,140,141]. At the high 
reaction temperature (900 C), formation of a volatile platinum oxide (PtO2) occurs at a very 
significant rate; in fact, the rate of loss of 0.050.3 g Pt/ton of HNO3 is high enough to provide a 
substantial economic incentive for Pt recovery [8]. The most effective recovery process involves 
placing a woven Pd-rich alloy gauze immediately below the PtRh gauze to capture the Pt through 
formation of a PdPt alloy. Pt loss is also the most significant cause of catalyst deactivation as the 
gauze surface becomes enriched in nonvolatile but inactive rhodium oxide [142], requiring shutdown 
and catalyst replacement every 312 months [8]. 
Decomposition of volatile platinum oxide species formed during high temperature reaction may 
(similar to the previously discussed formation of large crystallites of Ni from Ni(CO)4) lead to 
formation of large Pt crystallites and/or substantial restructuring of the metal surface. For example, Wu 
and Phillips [146148] observed surface etching, enhanced sintering, and dramatic surface 
restructuring of Pt thin films to faceted particles during ethylene oxidation over a relatively narrow 
temperature range (500700 C). The substantially higher rate of sintering and restructuring in 
O2/C2H4 relative to that in nonreactive atmospheres was attributed to the interaction of free radicals 
such as HO2, formed homogeneously in the gas phase, with the metal surface to form metastable 
mobile intermediates. Etching of PtRh gauze in a H2/O2 mixture under the same conditions as Pt 
surfaces (600 C, N2/O2/H2 = 90/7.5/2.5) has also been reported [143]. A significant weight loss was 
observed in a laminar flow reactor with little change in surface roughness, while in an impinging jet 
reactor, there was little weight loss, but substantial restructuring of the surface to particle-like 
structures, 110 μm in diameter; these particles were found to have the same PtRh composition as the 
original gauze. The nodular structures of about 10-μm diameter formed in these experiments are 
strikingly similar to those observed on PtRh gauze after use in production of HCN at 1100 C in 15% 
NH3, 13% CH4, and 72% air (see Figure 21). Moreover, because of the high space velocities during 
HCN production, turbulent rather than laminar flow would be expected, as in the impinging jet reactor. 
While little Pt is volatilized from the PtRh gauze catalyst during HCN synthesis, the extensive 
restructuring leads to mechanical weakening of the gauze [8].

Other examples of catalyst deactivation due to volatile compound formation include (1) loss of the 
phosphorus promoter from the VPO catalyst used in the fluidized-bed production of maleic anhydride, with 
an attendant loss of catalyst selectivity [8], (2) vapor-phase loss of the potassium promoter from  
steam-reforming catalysts in the high temperature, steam-containing environment [8], and (3) loss of Mo 
from a 12-Mo-V-heteropolyacid due to formation of a volatile Mo species during oxydehydrogenation of 
isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid [138]. 
While relatively few definitive studies of deactivation by volatile compound formation have been 
reported, the previous work does provide the basis for enumerating some general principles. A 
generalized mechanism of deactivation by formation of volatile metal compounds can be postulated 
(see Figure 22). In addition, the roles of kinetics and thermodynamics can be stated in general terms: 
(1) 
At low temperatures and partial pressures of the volatilization agent (VA), the overall rate 
of the process is limited by the rate of volatile compound formation. 
(2) 
At intermediate temperatures and partial pressures of the VA, the rate of formation of the 
volatile compound exceeds the rate of decomposition. Thus, the rate of vaporization is high, 
the vapor is stable, and metal loss is high. 
(3) 
At high temperatures and partial pressures of the VA, the rate of formation equals the rate 
of decomposition, i.e., equilibrium is achieved. However, the volatile compound may be 
too unstable to form or may decompose before there is an opportunity to be transported 
from the system. From the previous work, it is also evident that besides temperature and 
gas phase composition, catalyst properties (crystallite size and support) can play an 
important role in determining the rate of metal loss.

2.4.2. Solid-State Reactions 
Catalyst deactivation by solid-state diffusion and reaction appears to be an important mechanism for 
degradation of complex multicomponent catalysts in dehydrogenation, synthesis, partial oxidation, and 
total oxidation reactions [8,149160]. However, it is difficult in most of these reactions to know the 
extent to which the solid-state processes, such as diffusion and solid-state reaction, are affected by 
surface reactions. For example, the rate of diffusion of Al2O3 to the surface to form an aluminate may 
be enhanced by the presence of gas-phase oxygen or water or the nucleation of a different phase may 
be induced by either reducing or oxidizing conditions. Recognizing this inherent limitation, the focus 
here is nevertheless on processes in which formation of a new bulk phase (and presumably the 
attendant surface phase) leads to substantially lower activity. There is probably some overlap with 
some of the examples given under Gas/VaporSolid Reactions involving reactions of gas/vapor with 
solid to produce inactive phases. 
Examples from the literature of solid-state transformations leading to catalyst deactivation are 
summarized in Table 14. They include (1) the formation of KAlO2 during ammonia synthesis at the 
Fe/K/Al2O3 catalyst surface, (2) decomposition of the active phase PdO to inactive Pd metal during 
catalytic combustion on PdO/Al2O3 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts, (3) transformation of active carbides to 
inactive carbides in FischerTropsch synthesis on Fe/K/Cu catalysts, (4) formation of inactive V(IV) 
compounds in SO2 oxidation, and (5) reductive transformation of iron molybdate catalysts during 
partial oxidation of benzene, methanol, propene, and isobutene.

There are basic principles underlying most solid-state reactions in working catalysts that have been 
enumerated by Delmon [156]: (1) the active catalytic phase is generally a high-surface-area defect 
structure of high surface energy and as such a precursor to more stable, but less active phases and  
(2) the basic reaction processes may itself trigger the solid-state conversion of the active phase to an 
inactive phase; for example, it may involve a redox process, part of which nucleates the inactive phase.

planes in Mo18O52 and Mo4O11 are represented by the oblique arrows (boxes with an X 
represent MoO5 octahedra). Adapted from [156]. 
A well-documented example of these principles occurs in the partial oxidation of propene to 
acrolein on a Fe2(MoO4)3 catalyst [153,156]. This oxidation occurs by the Mars van Krevelen 
mechanism, i.e., a redox mechanism in which lattice oxygen reacts with the adsorbed hydrocarbon to 
produce the partially oxygenated product; the reduced catalyst is restored to its oxidized state through 
reaction with gaseous oxygen. In propene oxidation, two atoms of oxygen from the catalyst are used, 
one for removing two hydrogen atoms from the olefin and the other one in forming the unsaturated 
aldehyde. The fresh, calcined catalyst MoO3 consists of corner-sharing MoO6 octahedra (with Mo at 
the center and six oxygen atoms at the corners); but upon reduction to MoO2, octahedra share edges as 
shown in Figure 23. However, it has been reported [153,156] that only slightly reduced (relative to 
MoO3), open structures such as Mo18O52 and Mo8O23 are the most active, selective phases; more 
complete reduction of either of these structures leads to formation of Mo4O11 (see Figure 24) having 
substantially lower selectivity. Delmon and co-workers [154,156] have shown that addition of an 
oxygen donor such as Sb2O4 facilitates spillover of oxygen and thereby prevents overreduction and 
deactivation of the catalyst.

2.4.3. Reactions of Gas/Vapor with Solid to Restructure the Surface by Chemical Assisted Sintering 
The surfaces of metallic catalysts can be greatly roughened by interactions with the reactants and/or 
products. However, as opposed to forming volatile species that are transported out of the reactor as 
discussed in the previous section, these interactions lead to a restructuring of the surface that is similar to 
that which occurs during thermal sintering, but at temperatures which are below the Tamman or Huttig 
temperatures, respectively defined as 0.5 and 0.3 of the melting point (Tm) of the material, at which thermal 
sintering might be expected. Therefore, this surface restructuring must be attributed to the interaction of the 
gas phase with the solid. The following three examples from the literature highlight the chemical-assisted 
sintering process caused by adsorbate-surface interactions on Ni, Co, and Pd surfaces.  
Chemical sintering of Ni/alumina catalysts in methanation due to formation of volatile Ni(CO)4 
followed by its decomposition downstream to large Ni crystallites has been well documented [8,105]. 
Moreover, deactivation of Ni/alumina by Ni aluminate formation is also observed at the exit of methanators 
where temperature is moderately high (T = 450 C) and steam partial pressure is maximum [105]. 
Wilson and de Groot [161] reported that under high pressure (4 bar, H2/CO = 2) and moderate 
temperature (523 K) conditions, single crystal Co (0001) surfaces restructured significantly due to 
interaction with the CO, which they attributed to an etch-regrowth mechanism. The left hand panel of 
Figure 25a shows the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image of the single crystal surface, while 
Figure 25b shows the same location after exposure to the H2/CO atmosphere for 1 h The surface 
restructuring and roughening is profound, with the peaks approximately four atoms high relative to the 
previously smooth surface that had only well-defined steps interrupting the (0001) planar surface.

More recently, Parkinson et al. [162] have shown that chemical-assisted sintering occurs at room 
temperature for palladium supported on magnetite under ultra high vacuum conditions with CO partial 
pressures of only 5 × 1010 mbar. Figure 26 shows four STM images from a movie that demonstrates 
the surface mobility of the Pd at these low CO partial pressures. Figure 26a is the surface prior to CO 
exposure, while Figures 26bd show the surface as a function of time up to about an hour of exposure. 
The authors note that hydroxyl-Pd groups (OH-Pd), identified by the ×s in the images, serve as 
anchoring points for the coalescence of larger Pd clusters. The full movie, available with the

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
