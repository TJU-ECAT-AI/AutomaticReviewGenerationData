This paper reports the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation of Pt and PtSn 
catalysts on inert supports, studied by means of pulse and flow reaction techniques, in order 
to determine effects of support on catalytic behavior. 
K addition to Pt/A1203 and 
PtSn/A1203 significantly decreases catalyst deactivation, by lowering the amounts of coke 
deposited on the support and metal, while producing a coke with a lower degree of 
polymerization. Sn addition to Pt/A1203 improves the activity and selectivity to propylene 
and decreases deactivation. The addition of Sn to Pt/ZnAI204 not only enhances activity but 
also improves catalyst stability. The existence of strong interactions between Pt and Sn, with 
probable alloy formation, is suggested both on an acidic support like A1203, and on a pH- 
neutral support like ZnA1204. Bimetallic PtSn/ZnA1204 catalysts appear to have the highest 
stability and reversibility after several reaction steps including the corresponding 
regeneration steps between them. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Dehydrogenation of light paraffins is an endothermic reaction that must be carried out at 
high temperatures in order to obtain high yields of olefins, due to thermodynamic barriers. 
The use of metallic supported catalysts for this reaction has increased in recent years. Thus, 
supported Pt catalysts modified by the addition of an inert metal, like Sn, Ge, Pb, In, etc., 
appear to be promising catalytic agents [ 
1,2]. In these catalysts, the nature and behavior of 
the support are important topics to be considered. In fact, considering the high reaction 
temperatures and the highly exothermic reactions which take place during the regeneration 
steps, supports must exhibit both high thermal stability and high capacity to disperse the 
metallic phase. Moreover, the dehydrogenation of light paraffins can be accompanied by 
undesirable reactions such as formation of gases (by cracking and hydrogenolysis) and coke 
deposition. These undesirable reactions can be catalyzed by acidic supports and/or by the 
active metal. The modification of the structure of Pt by the addition of an inactive metal can 
modify the hydrogenolysis activity. Meanwhile, the cracking and polymerization reactions, 
catalyzed by acid sites, can be eliminated using neutral supports like Znml204 
spinels, or low 
acid supports like K-doped alumina. 
The catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction of Pt and PtSn 
catalysts on inert supports (like K-doped alumina and ZnAlaO 
4, and on an acidic AIaO3,) 
under conditions of high severity was studied by means of pulse and flow reaction 
techniques to determine the effect of the nature of the support on the catalytic behavior. The 
192 
stability of the different catalysts was followed by experiments of successive reaction- 
regeneration cycles. Besides, TPR, XRD, H 2 chemisorption and test reaction experiments 
(cyclohexane dehydrogenation and cyclopentane hydrogenolysis) were also carried out. The 
coke deposition was followed by a pulse reaction technique and TPO experiments. 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
Two different supports were used: a commercial (-A1203 (CK-300 from Cyanamid 
Ketjen, SBET-" 180 mEg 
l) and a ZnA1204 (SBET 
= 34 mEg 
l) prepared in the laboratory. The 
ZnAIEO 
4 spinel was obtained by solid phase reaction between (?-AlEO 
3 and pure ZnO at 
1173 K for 72 h. The solid was then cooled to room temperature and submitted for XRD 
analysis, which showed the characteristic lines of ZnA1EO 
4 and weak lines of ZnO. To 
eliminate the unreacted ZnO (which could produce PtZn alloys with a very low 
dehydrogenation capacity), the solid was repeatedly washed with portions of (NH4)ECO 3 
solution (1 M). After washing, the solid was dried and a new XRD analysis showed the 
total absence of the ZnO phase. 
Pt (0.3 wt%) and PtSn (0.3-0.3 wt%) catalysts supported on A1EO 
3 and ZnA1EO 
4 were 
prepared by wet impregnation. Thus, supported Pt catalysts were obtained by impregnation 
of the support with an acetic solution of HEPtC16 (AcH concentration: 0.3 M, HEPtCI 
6 
concentration: 0.011 M). After impregnation, samples were dried overnight at 393 K and 
then calcined in an air stream for 3 h at 773 K. Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on A1EO 
3 
and ZnAI204 were prepared by impregnation of their precursors, Pt/A1203 and Pt/ZnA1EO 
4 
obtained according to the aforementioned procedure, with a hydrochloric solution of SnC12 
(HC1 concentration: 0.4 M, SnC1E concentration: 0.0176 M). After impregnation, the solids 
were dried overnight at 393 K, and finally calcined in an air stream for 3 h at 773 K. 
Pt (0.3 wt%)/A1EOa-K and PtSn (0.3-0.3 wt%)/A1EO3-K were obtained by impregnation 
of the monometallic or bimetallic catalyst with a KOH aqueous solution (0.092 M) to obtain 
a final K concentration in the catalysts of 0.50 wt%. Then, samples were dried overnight at 
393 K, and finally calcined for 3 h at 773 K. 
Monometallic and bimetallic catalysts were activity-tested for propane dehydrogenation in 
a fixed-bed flow reactor. The sample, placed in a quartz reactor, was previously reduced for 
3 h at 853 K under flowing H E. Then the reaction mixture, composed of H E, C3H8, and He 
(HE/Call 
8 
molar ratio = 0.9, He/Call 
8 molar ratio = 8.1), was fed to the reactor. Weight time 
was 4 x 10 
-3 g cat min m1-1. 
Four minutes after the reaction began, the first sample of reactor 
effluent was injected into the chromatographic FID system with a dimethylsulfolane on 
Chromosorb column. The total reaction time was 80 minutes. 
A pulse reaction technique was used to study: (1) the behavior of the catalysts in the first 
step of the reaction, (2) the initial carbon deposition and, (3) the effects of carbon deposition 
on conversion and selectivity. Experiments were carded out at 853 K by injecting pulses of 
pure propane (pulse volume: 0.50 cm 
3 STP) to the catalytic bed, which was maintained 
under flowing He (30 ml min 
1) between two successive pulses. The samples were 
previously reduced for 3h at 853 K under flowing H 2. The reaction products were analyzed 
in a FID chromatographic system with a packed column (Porapack Q). 
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)experiments 
were carried out in a 
conventional TCD system using 10 ml min 
-I of an H 2 (5 wt%)-N 2 gaseous mixture at a 
constant heating rate of 6 K min 
-1 from room temperature up to 1073 K. Temperature- 
programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles were obtained using a mixture of O 
E 
(6 %v/v)-N 
2 and 
193 
a heating rate of 12 K min 
. Fresh samples were evaluated in cyclohexane (CH) 
dehydrogenation and cyclopentane (CP) hydrogenolysis reactions. CH dehydrogenation 
was performed at 573 K using an H2/CH molar ratio of 29. CP hydrogenolysis was carded 
out at 573 K using an H2/CP molar ratio of 25. Before activity testing, samples were 
reduced for 3h at 773 K under flowing H 2. 
To study catalyst stability, catalyst samples were subjected 
to 
five propane 
dehydrogenation reaction steps (6 h at 853K). After each reaction step, samples were 
submitted to a regeneration treatment with an 02 (5%v/v)-N 
2 mixture (6 h at 773 K). 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Table 1 shows both the initial propane conversion (X0) and the selectivity to propylene 
(So), measured 4 min after the reaction started, and the deactivation parameter (X/X 0 
obtained in flow reaction experiments). This parameter is defined as the difference between 
the initial propane conversion (Xo) and the final conversion (Xe) measured at 80 min of the 
reaction time, referred to the initial propane conversion for the different catalysts.

When the Pt/A1203 catalyst is doped with K, slight modifications of both the initial 
conversion and the selectivity to propylene, and a significant decrease of the deactivation 
parameter, are observed (Table 1). Additionally, the amount of coke deposited on Pt/ml203- 
K (1.26 wt%) is lower than that deposited on the undoped monometallic catalyst (1.95 
wt%), as shown by TPO and pulse technique results (Figures 1 and 2a). When K is added 
to alumina, a significant decrease of the strong acid sites of alumina was found [3] due to the 
blocking effect on the tetrahedral A1 
+3 acid sites [4]. However, other important effects must 
be considered. First, a decrease of the Pt dispersion after the alkali metal addition (from 55 
% for Pt/A1203 to 35% for K-doped catalyst) was detected. This increase in the metal particle 
size produces a decrease of the CH dehydrogenation/CP hydrogenolysis ratio, as shown in 
Table 2. Since that CP hydrogenolysis is a structure-sensitive reaction whereas the CH 
dehydrogenation is a structure-insensitive one, the increase of Pt particle size would produce 
a decrease of the dehydrogenation rate and a parallel increase of the amounts of Pt ensembles 
necessary for the hydrogenolysis reaction. Hence, K addition to Pt/A1203 produces two 
opposite effects: on the one hand, a poisoning of the acid sites of the support, and on the 
other, an increase of the Pt particle size. However, these effects would not justify the 
pronounced decrease of the deactivation of Pt/AI203-K. This fact suggests an additional 
effect of the K addition to Pt. Thus the TPR profile of Pt/A1203-K shows very important 
194 
differences with respect to the monometallic catalyst (Figure 3), which can be attributed to a 
modification of the structure of the supported Pt by the alkali metal addition. It has been 
reported in the literature that Pt is electronically modified by K addition [5], which would 
favor the labilization of olefins, decreasing the fouling effect on the metallic function. This 
agrees with the TPO profile of Pt/A1203-K (Figure 1), which shows not only a decrease of 
the carbon deposited on the support (2nd. oxidation peak), but also an important decrease of 
the carbon deposited on the metal (lst. oxidation peak), with respect to the undoped catalyst. 
Moreover, the first peak in the TPO profile is shifted to lower temperature, which can be 
attributed to a lower polymerization degree of coke.

The effect of Sn addition to Pt/ml203 is reflected in the increase of the initial activity and 
selectivity to propylene in flow reaction experiments accompanied by a decrease of the 
deactivation parameter (Table 1). The carbon retention obtained in the pulse experiments 
was also substantially lower for the bimetallic catalyst compared with Pt/A1203 (Figure 2a). 
The apparent increase of the initial activity for PtSn/A1203 observed in the flow experiments 
with respect to that of the monometallic one can be explained by taking into account the 
results obtained in pulse experiments (Figure 2b). In fact, the conversion in the first pulse is 
higher for Pt/A1203 than PtSn/A1203, while for the fifth pulse the slope of activity-pulse 
number curve is higher for the Pt/A1203 
catalyst. This can be attributed to the higher 
deactivation rate for the monometallic catalyst. The higher selectivity to propylene for 
PtSn/A1203 compared to that of Pt]A1203, can be assigned to a modification of the nature of 
the metal function by Sn addition, such as shown by TPR and test reactions. The TPR 
profile of PtSn/A1203 (Figure 3) shows a single reduction peak at 523 K with a very small 
shoulder at 780 K. This profile is very different from the one corresponding to the sum of 
the TPR profiles of the monometallic catalysts. Moreover, the activation energy for CH 
dehydrogenation for the PtSn/A1203 
catalyst (50.8 kcal mo1-1) is much higher than that on the 
Pt/A1203 samples (20.6 kcal mol). These results suggest a strong interaction between both 
metals with probable formation of PtSn alloys in the reduced bimetallic catalyst, which 
agrees with other results reported in the literature [6,7]. 
K addition to bimetallic PtSn catalyst supported on A1203 does not modify the initial 
activity and selectivity during the flow reaction of propane dehydrogenation but produces a 
decrease of the deactivation parameter, as shown in Table 1. This effect is accompanied by 
a lower carbon retention of the PtSn/AIOa-K catalyst with respect to the undoped bimetallic 
sample during the pulse experiments (Figure 2a). Moreover, TPO results on the K-doped 
bimetallic catalyst shows a lower coke deposition on both the metal and the support with 
respect to Pt/A1EOa-K 
(Figure 1). In this catalyst, the poisoning of the acid sites of alumina 
would be due not only to K but also to Sn addition. The TPR profile of the bimetallic 
catalyst doped with K (Figure 3) shows a modifying effect of the alkali metal on the metallic 
phase. Furthermore, considering the results obtained in test reactions, it was found that K 
addition to PtSn/A1203 significantly decreases the activation energy for CH dehydrogenation 
relative to that of the undoped bimetallic catalyst (from 50.8 to 35.3 Kcal mol-1), which 
would suggest that K decreases the interaction between Pt and Sn. This modification in the 
interaction between both metallic components could be due either to a direct action of K on 
the metallic phase or to an indirect effect of the alkali metal addition to the support, which 
could change the metal-support and the metal-metal interactions, such as suggested in the 
literature [5,8]. 
The monometallic Pt/ZnA1204 catalyst shows an initial conversion lower than the 
Pt/A1203, but a much higher selectivity to propylene (95%) and a lower deactivation 
parameter (Table 1). This effect is also reflected in a lower coke deposition (1.95 wt% C 
for Pt]A1203 
and 0.94 wt% for Pt/ZnA1204), as is observed in TPO profiles (Figure 1). The 
different behavior of these two catalysts cannot be related to the metal dispersion, since the 
196 
Pt dispersion for Pt/ZnAl204 (57%) was similar to that of Pt/A1203 
(55%), according to the 
hydrogen chemisorption measurements. Therefore, the different performance of both 
monometallic catalysts can be attributed to a different structure of the metallic phases. Thus, 
Bosch et al [9] observed no systematic relative orientation between crystallographic planes 
of the support and those of the Pt particles supported on ZnA1204. In this sense, the TPR 
profile of Pt/ZnA1204 (Figure 3) is sharp and well defined, which could be due to the 
presence of a narrow population of metallic species. All this evidence could suggest that Pt 
is composed of small, homogeneous particles, with a high concentration of sites for propane 
dehydrogenation and a low concentration of hydrogenolytic sites, consistent with the 
cyclopentane hydrogenolysis results.

Figure 3. TPR profiles of different catalysts. 
The addition of Sn to the PIfZRA1204 
catalyst apparently promotes activity in the propane 
dehydrogenation reaction, while the selectivity to propylene remains practically unchanged, 
and the deactivation rate is markedly decreased (Table 1). However, coke contents were 
similar for both PI/ZnA1204 and PtSn/ZnAI204 
catalysts (0.94 and 0.86 wt%, respectively). 
To explain these results, TPO experiments were performed. The profile of the bimetallic 
sample (Figure 1) displays an oxidation peak at 560 K, and a shoulder at higher 
temperatures, probably due to the carbon deposited on the support. The first peak, 
corresponding to carbonaceous species deposited in the neighborhood of the metal, is 
shifted to higher temperatures with respect to the peak found in the monometallic catalyst, 
probably due to a different carbonaceous structure. Therefore, the lower extent of 
deactivation observed for the bimetallic catalyst could be due to the beneficial effect of Sn 
favoring deposition of the coke at the metal-support interface, without affecting the active 
sites of the metal, thus producing a coke of lower toxicity at a different location. Figure 3 
shows TPR profiles of the PtSn/ZnA1204 catalyst and those corresponding to monometallic 
Pt/ZnA1204 and Sn/ZnA1204 catalysts. The profile of the bimetallic sample displays a sharp 
reduction peak coincident with the Pt reduction, with a small reduction zone at temperatures 
197 
where the Sn reduction in Srl]Znml204 takes place. These results would indicate that the 
metallic phase of this bimetallic catalyst is composed of different species, and that a 
significant fraction would correspond to intermetallic compounds or PtSn alloy particles 
(probably with a well-defined composition). 
Table 3 shows the evolutions of initial activity (X0) and initial selectivity (So) for the 
different propane dehydrogenation reaction steps (obtained from experiments of reaction- 
regeneration cycles). Some differences are evident relative to the trends reported in Table 1. 
These differences can be attributed to a different residence time in both experiments. It can 
be observed in all cases that the initial activity (X0) decreases through the successive steps. 
The percentage decrease of the initial conversion between the first and the fifth step, with 
respect to the initial activity of the first reaction step, follows this sequence: 
Pt/A1203 (76%) > Pt/A12Oa-K 
(47%) > PtSn/A12Oa-K 
(42%) > PtSrotZnA1204 
(15%)

These results show (1) the highest reversibility of the regeneration process for the 
bimetallic catalyst supported on ZnA1204, (2) a higher extent of deactivation for PE]A1203 
relative to Pt/A1EOa-K, 
and (3) improved stability due to Sn addition to Pt especially for the 
catalyst supported on ZnA1204, whose conversion is practically constant through the 
successive reaction steps (Table 3). With respect to the selectivity to propylene, the most 
pronounced changes correspond to Pt/A1203 and Pt/A1EO3-K catalysts. 
Selectivity to 
propylene remains practically constant through five cycles for PtSn/ZnA1204 and 
PtSn/A1EOa-K. However, selectivities to propylene are higher for the PtSn supported on 
ZnA1204 
(96-98%)relative to those for PtSn supported on the K-doped alumina (89-90%). 
These results clearly show the important role of the ZnA1204 spinel support in promoting 
activity, selectivity and stability of the metallic phase. 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
1. K added to Pt/A1203 blocks acidic sites of the support. It also substantially decreases 
the deactivation of the catalyst, diminishing the amounts of carbon deposited not only on the 
support but also on the metal. The coke deposited on Pt displays a lower degree of 
polymerization. These effects are probably caused by an electronic modification of the 
metallic phase due to the K addition. 
2. The significant modification of the metallic phase of Pt due to Sn addition, with 
probable alloy formation, was confirmed by TPR results and by the substantial changes of 
198 
the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation. Sn addition to Pt also enhances the 
selectivity to propene and decreases the catalyst deactivation rate. 
3. The change from an acidic support (like A1203) to another with neutral or nonacidic 
characteristics (like ZnA1204)produces important modifications in the characteristics and 
catalytic performance of the metallic phase. The different behavior of Pt/ZnA1204 and 
Pt/A1203 cannot be attributed to an effect of particle size, but to changes in the structure of 
the metallic particles. In this way, the TPR profile of the Pt]ZnAI204 
catalyst would indicate 
the existence of a narrow population of surface species forming small particles of 
homogeneous 
characteristics, 
with 
a 
high 
concentration 
of 
sites 
for 
propane 
dehydrogenation and a low concentration of sites promoting hydrogenolysis. 
4. Sn addition to Pt/ZnA1204 improves activity and decreases deactivation rate in the 
propane dehydrogenation reaction. This improvement in the stability is related to the lower 
toxicity of the coke deposited on the bimetallic catalyst located at the support-metal interface.
