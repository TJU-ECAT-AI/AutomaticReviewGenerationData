The surface properties of catalyst supports are important in regulating the catalytic properties of heterogeneous
catalysts. Herein, we studied the effect of acid-base properties of alumina on metal-support interaction and coke
deposition, and investigated the stability of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using PtSn/Al2O3. We
prepared γ-Al2O3 (A750) from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH) and compared it with a
commercial sample (Sasol Puralox SBA-200; P200). We loaded 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn on alumina then
conducted propane dehydrogenation at 590 C (WHSV = 5.2 h1). PtSn/A750 and PtSn/P200 showed com-
patible initial activity (conversion = 50%) and selectivity (> 95%). After 20 h of reaction, PtSn/A750 showed a
slight decrease in activity (39.9%) while the activity of PtSn/P200 dropped significantly (28.4%). Spent catalysts
showed different metal sintering behavior and coke deposition which are well known causes for catalyst de-
activation. A high strength of Lewis acid sites in A750 (higher Td in ethanol TPD) prevented the sintering of
metal by strong metal-support interaction. Also, the lower number of Lewis acid sites in A750 than that of P200
reduced deposited coke on the catalysts (PtSn/A750: 1.8 wt% and PtSn/P200: 8.6 wt%). Furthermore, diffuse
reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy after CO adsorption at -150 C clearly demonstrated that
coke deposition was initiated from Lewis acid sites on the alumina surface, but then aromatization occurs at
these sites. These results suggested that strong metal-support interactions to hold metal particles and less re-
sidual Lewis acid sites after metal loading to reduce coke deposition are important factors for designing stable
and coke-resistant PtSn on alumina catalysts. Furthermore, precise characterization and understanding of the
acid-base properties of alumina will contribute in developing catalysts with high stability.
1. Introduction
Recently, the demand for light olefins including propylene has in-
creased because of their applications as raw materials in polypropylene,
propylene oxide, oxo-alcohol, acrylonitrile, and acrylic acid in petro-
chemicals [112]. In general, steam cracking and fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC) of oil supply light olefins. However, these processes are
insufficient for meeting the growing demand for propylene because of
their high energy consumptions and low selectivity. Hence, propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained attention for propylene production
by utilizing propane gas.
Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in the PDH industrial field
due to their excellent activity and thermal stability. However, PDH,
which affords high yields of propylene, is an endothermic reaction. It
requires high reaction temperatures causing severe catalyst deactiva-
tion by metal sintering and coke deposition formed through undesired
side reactions like hydrogenolysis, oligomerization, and aromatization
of light alkanes.
To achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, many studies
attempted to modify Pt-based catalysts with additives like second metal
components (Sn, Ga, Zn) to split the Pt ensemble and change the
electronic properties of Pt particles [1316]. Moreover, alkali (Li, Na,
K), alkali earth (Mg, Ca), and rare earth (La, Ce) metals were employed
to modify the properties of the support [1726]. For instance, Yu et al.
reported that the addition of Ce to PtSn on alumina catalysts improved
its stability by promoting strong metal-support interactions [23].
Especially for PtSn catalysts, it is known that Sn neutralizes the acid
sites on the alumina surface. Sn also helps hydrocarbon desorption from
the metal and facilitates the migration of coke precursor from the metal
surface to support surfaces [1,8,13,14]. However, a fundamental un-
derstanding of the acid-base properties of Al2O3 for improving catalytic
reactivity in alumina-based PDH catalysts has been yet to be developed.

By extension, the role of the support has been considered important
as much as the supported metal, and so, various supports have been
synthesized and used in PDH reaction to obtain high stability
[36,27,28]. Recently, Shi et al. reported a novel nanosheet alumina for
PDH, resulting in a highly stable catalyst. The improved stability of the
catalysts were attributed to large amounts of penta-coordinated Al3+
sites (Alp) observed from 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic
resonance (MAS-NMR) studies which are known for Pt anchoring sites
[6,44]. However, there was a lack of explanation of the location of
abundant Alp sites and acid-base properties of the alumina surface.
Here, to clarify the effect of the acid-base properties of alumina on
catalyst stability, we synthesized high-surface area γ-Al2O3 derived
from ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide (AACH). The synthe-
sized
γ-Al2O3
exhibited
significantly
different
surface
properties
(stronger and less amounts of Lewis acid sites) from commercial γ-
Al2O3, despite both having the same bulk properties. PDH was con-
ducted after loading Pt-Sn on these two different γ-Al2O3. The catalytic
stability of PtSn/Al2O3 derived from AACH was improved by suppres-
sing sintering of the PtSn alloy particles and coke accumulation.
Moreover, we provided the direct evidence of the relation between
Lewis acid sites and coke behavior and investigated the locations of
abundant Alp sites. We intended to contribute to improving the activity,
selectivity, and stability of catalysts by characterizing and controlling
the acid-base properties of alumina surfaces.
2. Experimental section
2.1. AACH synthesis
Fibrous AACH was synthesized following a slightly modified pro-
cedure from the previous study [29]. AACH precursor was first pre-
pared. Al(NO3)3·9H2O and urea ((NH2)2CO3) in 1:9 M ratio were dis-
solved in distilled water (100 mL) with 0.17 M Al3+. The mixture was
transferred to a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and
maintained at 100 C in an oven for 24 h. After cooling to room tem-
perature, the resultant white precipitate was filtered, washed with
distilled water and isopropyl alcohol several times, and then dried at
80 C for 24 h. To obtain γ-Al2O3, the as-prepared AACH powders were
calcined at different temperatures (600 C and 750 C) for 5 h. The final
powder products were labeled A600 and A750, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
PtSn/Al2O3 was synthesized by the incipient wetness co-impregna-
tion method with optimum amounts of 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.9 wt% Sn.
Accordingly, the amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O were dis-
solved in ethanol. The metal precursor was then impregnated in Al2O3
three times to obtain a homogenized metal loading. The catalysts were
dried for 12 h in an electrical oven at 60 C, followed by calcination in
20% O2/He (total 100 sccm) at 500 C for 4 h, and then reduced in 10%
H2/He (total 60 sccm) at 590 C for 2 h. Puralox SBA-200 (Sasol, γ-
Al2O3) was used as reference alumina in this study. The synthesized
catalysts were labeled as PtSn/A600, PtSn/A750, and PtSn/P200, cor-
respondingly.
2.3. Characterization
XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 in-
strument with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) and step size of 0.02/s,
operated at 40 kV and 20 mA. The specific surface area was determined
by measuring the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm at 196 C using
ASAP 2420. Pore size distributions were determined by using the
Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The morphology of the synthe-
sized alumina was examined with an S-4800 field emission scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM; Hitachi, Japan) at 10 kV. Solid-state 27Al
MAS-NMR experiments were performed at room temperature on a
Varian VNMRS 600 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer operating at a magnetic
field
of
14.4 T.
The
corresponding
27Al
Larmor
frequency
was
156.3 MHz. All spectra were acquired using a 1.6-mm pencil-type MAS
probe at spinning rate 25 kHz. Each spectrum was obtained from
512 scans with recycle delay time of 2 s. All spectra were externally
