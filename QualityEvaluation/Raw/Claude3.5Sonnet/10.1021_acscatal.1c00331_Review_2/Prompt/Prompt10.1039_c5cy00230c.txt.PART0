Abstract 
Catalytic propane dehydrogenation over an alumina supported Pt catalyst in the 
presence of steam is carried out and it is found that the catalyst activity is increased 
and the apparent activation energy lowered due to the presence of steam. Three 
possible mechanisms, i.e. co-adsorption, Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal, of 
changes in energetics and pathways for propane dehydrogenation due to the presence 
of steam are explored by DFT calculation. The results show that co-adsorption of C3 
species with the surface oxygenated species would elevate dehydrogenation energy 
barriers due to repulsion interactions between them. Surface OH is more active than 
surface O in activating C-H bond in propane and propyl species through either 
Langmuir-Hinshelwood or Eley-Rideal mechanism and plays an important role in 
propane dehydrogenation with steam. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is 
kinetically favorable, in which the activations of the first H in propane by surface -OH 
are the rate determining steps, but the activation energies are higher than that on clean 
Pt(111) surface. The observed enhanced catalysts activity is ascribed to the lowered 
coking rates as well as the changes in surface coverage due to the co-adsorption of

1 Introduction 
Propene is an important building block for a wide range of commodity and 
specialty chemicals1-4. Now, traditional ways of producing it can no longer meet the 
ever growing need. As the natural gas supplies are increasing due to the rising 
exploration of shale gas5, there has been growing interest in recent years in the 
on-purpose production of propene from propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. 
Tens of PDH factories with total capacity of over 10 million of tons are building all 
over the world6. 
Supported platinum catalyst is used in several commercialized PDH 
technologies7, e.g. Oleflex, STAR, etc. and proved by experimental and theoretical 
studies to be the most active catalyst for PDH due to its high density of electronic 
states close to the Fermi level8, 9,10. Large research efforts have been devoted to trying 
to promote the performances of Pt catalysts by introducing promoters or using 
different kinds of supports11-13. But coking and deactivating of this kind of catalyst are 
still inevitable problems14.  
In industrial practice, co-feed of hydrogen7,15-18 or steam19 with propane is used 
to enhance the performance of platinum-based catalysts. The presence of hydrogen 
can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate15-17. Using DFT

calculation, Hauser et al.20 and Yang et al.21 have proved that the presence of surface 
hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less 
competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the 
dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies. However, 
introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering 
point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the 
compression energy consumption for the following separation process. 
Steam has been widely used as energy carrier, coke remover and diluent in 
dehydrogenation processes19, 22, 23. Introducing steam in the feed can strengthen PDH 
processes by increasing propane equilibrium conversion and lowering the temperature 
drop of the adiabatic dehydrogenation reactors19. Dong et al.24 found that under the 
same propane partial pressure, steam can contribute to higher propene yield compared 
with that in nitrogen atmosphere. However, the results reported by Fattahi et al.25 and 
our group26 have shown that the promoting effect of steam on PDH over alumina 
supported Pt-Sn catalyst is only valid in a certain range of steam amount.  
For the purpose of taking the best advantage of those merits of steam, several 
terms should be addressed. For one thing, platinum-based catalysts used in steam 
atmosphere need to be designed carefully to avoid the sintering of Pt particles27,28.   
Beyond this, the critical role of steam on dehydrogenation kinetics over Pt surfaces 
should be illustrated to help to determine the optimum operating conditions and 
provide some insight into the basic principles for catalysts design. Unfortunately, 
these questions are still poorly understood and consensus has hardly been reached.  In

the kinetic model for PDH in steam atmosphere developed by Luu et al.29 over a tin 
modified Pt/γ -Al2O3, steam was involved in the dominator of their kinetic model 
with a second order. But to interpret similar retarding effects of steam, some other 
authors25,27,28 suggested that sintering of platinum particles was the reason for the 
observed activity decrease. Several authors25, 28, 30 in literature also suggested that 
surface hydroxyl generated from adsorption and dissociation of water may help to 
remove hydrogen in the rate limiting step of propane dehydrogenation and thus 
increase propene formation rate. Unfortunately, this hypothesis has not been verified 
by either experimental or theoretical results. 
In the present study, the effect of steam on PDH has been re-examined over a 
monometallic Pt catalyst with narrow particle size distribution. To obtain additional 
insights into the effect of steam on PDH over Pt nanoparticles, a computational study 
has also been carried out, focusing on the influence of surface adsorbate, like H2O, 
hydroxyl group (OH) and oxygen atom ( O), on the C-H bond activation. 
2 Experimental detail 
Alumina supported platinum catalyst was prepared by the colloid method31. The 
preparation procedures were as follows. Firstly, 5 mL water and 5 mL ethylene glycol 
were mixed in a flask. Then 2.0 g of γ-Al2O3 (Aldrich) and 0.1 g of H2PtCl6•6H2O 
(99.9%, Sinopharm) was added and dispersed with the help of ultra-sonic wave. After 
stirring overnight, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 13.0 by using sodium 
hydroxide in non-aqueous ethylene glycol (2M). After that, the platinum was reduced 
at 130 oC in argon for 4 h, then cooled to room temperature and the pH of the solution

was adjusted to 3.0. After stirring another 2 h, the solids were obtained after 
subsequent repeated centrifugation, washing and drying processes.  
The metal loading of the catalyst was determined by ICP-AES and the metal 
dispersion was characterized by H2-Chem and HRTEM techniques. The PDH reaction 
was carried out in a μBenchCAT reactor (Altamira Instrument, USA) equipped with a 
quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The reactor was placed in an electrical 
furnace and the reaction temperature can be maintained within 0.5 oC of the desired 
set point. The catalyst loading was 0.05g for all catalyst testing experiments. All the 
experiments were conducted at  WHSVpropane = 7.1 h-1 and a hydrogen to propane 
molar ratio of 4. The water was introduced into the reactor system by using a pump and 
vaporized before reaching the reaction zone. Argon was used as balance gas to get a 
total flow of 200 ml/min. The mass transfer limitations were excluded at these 
conditions. The gas composition (C1-C3 hydrocarbons, H2, CO and CO2) were 
analyzed online with a 4-channel Micro-GC( INFICON3000, USA). 
3. Computational details 
Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out 
using the VASP package32-34. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the 
PBE functional was used for all the atoms. The interactions between valence electrons 
and ion cores were represented by Blchls all-electron-like projector augmented 
wave method (PAW)35. A tight convergence of the plane-wave expansion was 
obtained with a cut-off of 400 eV. Brillouin zone sampling was performed by using a 
MonkhorstPack grid with respect to the symmetry of the system and the electronic

occupancies were determined according to a Methfessel-Paxton scheme36 with an 
energy smearing of 0.2 eV. 
The Pt(111) surface was represented by a four-layer slab with a p(3×3) supercell, 
as described previously37. A MonkhorstPack mesh of 7×7×1 k-points was used for 
the 2D Brillouin zone integration. The bottom two layers of the slab were kept fixed 
to their crystal lattice positions (Pt-Pt distance = 2.82 Å). Spin-polarization had been 
considered for radical-containing systems. The ground-state atomic geometries of 
bulk and surfaces were obtained by minimizing the HellmanFeynman forces with the 
conjugate-gradient algorithm until the total force on each ion was below 0.03 eV/Å. 
The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated according to the expression

where EX is the DFT-total energy of the X system. A negative Eads indicates an energy 
gain process. 
Transition states (TS) were searched with the dimer method38-40. The most stable 
configurations of the reactant on the surface were determined by the sta ndard DFT 
minimization. These configurations were used as the initial state, from which the 
dimer method was used to find the lowest curvature mode and to climb up the 
potential energy surface from minima to saddle points. The convergence was regarded 
to be achieved when the force on each atom was less than 0.03 eV/Å.

The physical properties of the prepared Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are as follows. The 
platinum loading of it is 1.5% and the mean particle size is 4.9 nm, based on H2-Chem 
results (metal dispersion of 23.3 %), which is comparable to the statistics result of 5.5 
nm obtained from HTEM images, shown in Fig. S1(Supporting Information).  
 Propane dehydrogenation over this catalyst was performed to investigate the 
effect of steam. During the experiments, the conversion of propane was found to be 
within 7.0%, thus the turnover frequency (TOF(propane, propylene)) to represent the 
catalysts activity can be calculated as following :

As is shown in Fig. 1(a), the catalysts activity (TOFpropane) increases with the 
increase of steam partial pressure and reaches a plateau at higher steam concentrations, 
which may indicate that the reaction is controlled by water adsorption equilibrium 
under these water partial pressures. At the same time, the opposite trend is observed 
for the propene formation rates and the gap between TOFpropane and TOFpropylene

increases with the increase of steam partial pressure and finally reaches a plateau as 
well. When looking into products distribution, it can be seen from Fig. 1(b) that the 
loss of the selectivity to propylene mainly goes to the cracking products, CH4 and 
C2H4, with a selectivity of around 60.0% at steam partial pressure of between 1.92 
and 3.5 kPa. In the same steam partial pressure range, oxidizing products, CO and 
CO2, are also detected with the selectivity to them of around 10.0%, indicating the 
dissociation of water and the involvement of these oxygenated species in propane 
dehydrogenation pathways.

kPa; H2, 6 kPa, steam partial pressure is shown in picture, balance is nitrogen. 
 The apparent activation energies under different conditions were evaluated and 
presented in Fig. 2. It is found that PDH in the presence of steam has lower activation 
energies of 56.0 kJ/mol than that without steam introduction of 75.5 kJ/mol. The 
activation energies obtained here fit in the range of 30-150 kJ/mol for PDH reported 
in Ref41.  
From results stated above, it can be seen that introduction of steam in the feed has 
apparent and complicated influences on PDH over Pt catalyst, which testifies the

essential role of water and surface oxygenated species in the PDH. But whether the 
participation of these surface oxygenated species would alter the reaction route and 
thus decrease the PDH apparent activation energy or not is still under debate. In the 
following parts, DFT investigation of the effect of adsorption of steam and its 
subsequent dissociated species on PDH reaction mechanism is conducted and the 
factors contributing to changes in catalysts performance are discussed.  
4.2 DFT results 
 We started with the co-adsorption of C3 species and water. Then, three possible 
changes in dehydrogenation mechanisms were considered in the following parts: 1) 
Dehydrogenation of C3 species over oxygenated species pre-covered Pt(111) surfaces 
(Co-adsorption effects for short hereafter); 2) Dehydrogenation of C3 species over 
Pt(111) surfaces with the participation of surface oxygenated species in the transition 
states for dehydrogenation and hydrogen removal (Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
mechanism); 3) Dehydrogenation of C3 species over the adsorbed surface oxygenated 
species (Eley-Rideal mechanism).

The adsorptions of water monomer and co-adsorption of water and C3 species 
were studied to explore possible existing interactions between them. The adsorption 
configurations with lowest-energy for water monomer and water-propane complex 
were presented in Fig. 3. A water monomer favorably adsorbs on atop sites of Pt(111) 
surface via an O-Pt bond of 2.40 Å and HO (HOH plane orientation over the surface ) 
of 97.2o, which are in consistent with DFT calculations in literatures42-44 and indicate 
that water is nearly parallel to the surface. For the water-propane complex, the nearest 
H-H bond between them is 1.94 Å. Changes in water structure are observed that the 
O-Pt bond is shortened by 0.02 Å and the angle of HO increases by 3.2o. But no 
noticeable changes in configurations of propane compared with that on clean surface 
could be observed.  
The calculated adsorption energies are listed in table 1. To better understand the 
interaction between the hydrocarbon species and water, the co-adsorption energies are 
decomposed according to the following function: 
            
 
where Eads_A/Eads_B is one-point adsorption energy of A or B by fixing their 
geometries, Eint_AB is the interaction energy between A and B, Ecoads is the overall 
co-adsorption energy of A-B complex, A and B represent hydrocarbon species and 
water, respectively.  
In the case of water-propane complex, no noticeable changes in adsorption 
energy of propane (Eads_A) and water (Eads_B) is observed. The increased Ecoads is 
ascribed to the existing of a weak attractive interaction between propane and water

(0.05 eV in strength). But for n-propyl, i-propyl and propene, co-adsorption with 
water result in a decrease of Ecoads (0.06 and 0.08 eV in strength, respectively) due to 
repulsion interactions between them. It also should be noticed that, in the case of 
propene-water co-adsorption, significant decrease of Eads_B was observed (decreased 
by 0.05 eV), indicating changes of water adsorption configuration in addition to the 
repulsion interaction.

The presence of carbon oxides as by-products indicates the dissociation of water 
molecule on platinum surface. Therefore, surface -OH and -O are also considered in 
the following parts to investigate the possible influences of them on dehydrogenation 
mechanism. In this section, the co-adsorption effects are discussed. 
The most favorable adsorption sites for surface -OH and -O are bridge and 
hollow sites, respectively, as listed in table S1. To search for the transition states for 
dehydrogenating steps, surface -OH or -O was put at different favorable adsorption

As can be seen from Table 2, co-adsorption of water and oxygenated species 
with C3 species could elevate all the activation energies of different elementary steps 
to some extent. For example, with the co-adsorption of water, the activation energies 
of propane dehydrogenation to propene (ES1-ES4 in Table2) are elevated slightly by 
0.010.03 eV; in the cases of co-adsorption with surface -OH and -O, the activation 
energies of ES1-ES4 steps are lifted by 0.050.06 eV. The elevation of the activation 
energies for dehydrogenation steps indicates that the catalyst activity may decrease for 
the co-adsorption mechanism. Among all the three co-adsorption species, 
co-adsorption of water has the least influence on PDH energy barriers, but the 
discrepancies from the effect of the other two species is small. Considering the fact 
that the structures of transition states remain almost unchanged compared with that on 
clean surface (shown in Fig. S2), the repulsion between surface oxygenated species

and C3 species would account for such increase in activation energy.  
The activation energies of propene deep dehydrogenating steps (ES5 and ES6) 
are elevated by 0.03-0.11 eV due to the presence of co-adsorption species indicating 
the co-adsorption mechanism may decrease the catalyst activities. But, it should be 
noticed that this may not mean the selectivity to propene cracking reactions is reduced. 
Actually, for the co-adsorption of surface OH, the difference between the ES5 and 
ES1-ES4 
is 
reduced,

the

dehydrogenation/propane dehydrogenation may increase and the selectivity to

4.2.3 Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism  
The Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is discussed in this section. For the 
convenience of comparison, the related results of propane dehydrogenation on bare 
Pt(111) surfaces37 are recalled.

 The structure configurations for propane dehydrogenation on bare Pt(111) 
surface are presented in Fig. 4(a). For the first C-H bond activation, through primary 
H (TS1) or secondary H atom (TS2), the readily removing H atom is adsorbed on 
bridge sites of Pt surface, with C-H bond length of 1.50 Å and 1.57 Å, respectively. 
When an adsorbed hydroxyl is presented at atop of the adjacent Pt atom, it can be 
involved in the TS (TS5 and TS6 in Fig. 4(b)) by interacting with the readily 
removing H atom. These structures give shorter C-H bond length of 1.34 Å, 
meanwhile, a water molecule is nearly formed with a H-O bond length of 1.50 Å. 
Similar TS structures can be obtained in the case of surface oxygen atom (TS9 and 
TS10 in Fig. 4(c)), in which oxygen atom is adsorbed at bridge site on Pt surface and 
a surface hydroxyl is to be formed.

The activation energies for these dehydrogenation steps are presented in Fig. 5. 
For activation of the first H atom, the results show that the involvements of hydroxyl 
in TS structures shift the energy barriers to higher values of 0.74 eV (TS5) and 0.77 
eV (TS6) to produce n, i-propyl species, respectively, compared with those of 0.69 eV

steps have even higher activation energies of 1.32 eV (TS9) and 1.37 eV (TS10), 
suggesting the inactive nature of these surface oxygen atoms. The distance of H-Pt

bond in these cases are elongated by around 0.3 Å, which indicates the decrease of 
adsorption energy due to the repulsion interaction between the surface oxygenated 
species and adsorbed C3 species and could partly account for the higher activation 
energies of these steps. 
Interesting phenomenon was found in the case of surface -OH assisted β-H 
elimination steps. At the TS8, through which i-propyl dehydrogenates to propene, the 
activated C-H bond length (1.53 Å) is similar to that on bare surface (1.54 Å) and the 
H-O bond (1.86 Å) is longer than that in TS5-TS7 (1.40-1.50 Å). This configuration 
gives an activation energy of 0.63 eV, lower than that on bare surface by a magnitude 
of 0.05 eV. But, for surface -OH assisted n-propyl dehydrogenating to propene, the 
activation energy is elevated to 0.88 eV. Surface -O is also inactive in the β-H 
elimination steps. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the activation energies of these steps 
are elevated to as high as 1.251.37 eV(TS 11 and TS12), which are much higher than 
that of 0.68-0.70 eV(TS3 and TS4) on bare Pt(111) surfaces.

To provide a rational interpretation for the obtained results, the activation 
energies for propene producing steps are decomposed as follows:

where Eads,TS is the adsorption energy of the activated complex with respect to the 
gaseous propene , OH and H species , Ebond(C3H6H) is the CH bond energy at the 
methyl group of gaseous n-propyl or i-propyl and Eads,C3H7 is the adsorption energy of 
propyl species. As the bond energy and propyl adsorption energy keep constant, the 
variation in Eact depends solely on the changes in Eads, TS which can be further 
decomposed into the following five terms:

where Eads,TS(propene), Eads,TS(H), Eads,TS(OH) are the adsorption energies of propene, H and 
OH respectively with their geometries in the activated complex, Eint,lat(H,propene) and 
Eint,lat(H+propene, OH) represents the interaction energy of H-propene and OH-(H+propene) 
in the activated complexes respectively. From Eq 4, one can see that a more negative 
Eads,TS(propene) (Eads,TS(H), Eads,TS(OH)) and a lower Eint,lat(H,propene) (Eint,lat(H+propene, OH)) lead 
to a more negative Eads,TS, which contribute to a lower energy barrier. 
The transition states of TS3 and TS4 on bare Pt(111) surface and their 
counterparts of surface -OH assisted ones TS7 and TS8 are decomposed to analyze 
the factors contributing to the elevated and lowered activation energies. The results 
are shown in Table 3. In TS7, it is found that the adsorptions of propene and hydrogen 
are weakened, hydroxyl can attract hydrogen with an attractive energy of -0.45 eV 
and the interaction between hydrogen and propene is lowered. But the interactions are

insufficient to compensate the weakened adsorption of hydrocarbons and shift the 
activation energy to a higher value. In TS8, the attractive energy from surface -OH is 
lower than that in TS7, but the adsorption energies for propene and hydrogen are 
higher than those on bare Pt(111) surface and lower the activation energy. This means 
that the adsorption energies of propene and hydrogen atom dominates in the activation 
energies. 
When the total energy of the initial propane and -OH (or O) co-adsorption state 
is set to zero, it can be seen that the surface -OH assisted dehydrogenation route is 
thermodynamically favorable with heat releases of 0.59 eV and 0.77 eV for the two 
consecutive C-H bond activation steps. While the situation is different for surface 
oxygen atom involved reactions, in which the first step is a slightly endothermic 
reaction and only the second step is an exothermic step with a releasing heat of 0.16 
eV. Therefore, the surface oxygen atom is both kinetically and thermodynamically 
unfavorable. 
4.2.4 Eley-Rideal mechanism 
Its well known that catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over some 
metal oxide catalysts follows Mars-van Krevelen mechanism45-49 and Eley-Rideal 
mechanism50-53, for the later pathways, the surface oxygen species are involved in 
activating and abstracting H from propane. To gain a better understanding of the effect 
of oxygenated species on Pt(111) surface, this possible reaction pathway is also 
considered here.

species and the corresponding energy profiles are shown in Fig. 7. In the case of 
oxidation of propane by surface hydroxyl through H abstraction, the transition state 
for the activation of the C-H bond in methyl group is successfully located and 
presented in Fig.6 of TS13, in which the C-H bond is elongated from 1.10 Å to 1.54 Å 
and a water molecule is readily formed with a H-O distance of 1.11 Å, which is quite 
close to the H-O bond length of 0.99 Å in a gaseous H2O molecule. The reaction 
barrier is calculated to be 1.08 eV. The activation of propane through the breaking of 
C-H bond in methylene was also calculated and found to be more favorable with an 
energy barrier of 0.88 eV. Shorter C-H bond length of 1.42 Å can be observed in the 
geometry. From thermodynamic points of view, the C-H bond energy in methyl group 
is stronger than that in the methylene group (420 kJ/mol and 401 kJ/mol54). Therefore, 
the production of i-propayl radical is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored, 
which is in consistence with the observations in the literature46, 54, 55.  
  For oxidation of propane by atomic oxygen species, the energy barrier of 
producing i-propyl radical is 0.22 eV lower than that of producing n-propyl radical 
and kinetically favorable. However, compared with dehydrogenation by surface 
hydroxyl, the activation of propane by atomic oxygen species is much harder since 
producing i-propyl radical needs to conquer an energy barrier of as high as 1.64 eV. 
The atop site for oxygen atom adsorption in transition states is one of the reasons 
accounting for such high activation energy. The most favored adsorption 
configuration for oxygen atom is hollow sites with adsorption energy of 4.41 eV and 
adsorption on atop sites has adsorption energy of 3.13 eV. But the transition states

cannot be successfully located when putting oxygen at either hollow or bridge sites.  
After the first H abstraction from propane, propyl radicals are formed in the gas 
phase (as shown in Fig. 8). These radicals are close to the newly formed groups 
(surface H2O or -OH) with bond lengths ranging from 1.99 Å to 2.18 Å. At the next 
step, these radicals will adsorb on Pt(111) surface, and no transition states could be 
located for the adsorption processes. 
The β-hydrogen elimination steps can also proceed by the H abstracting reaction 
in the presence of surface oxygenated species and this step follows surface reaction 
mechanism. The transition states are successfully located and the specific 
configurations are shown in Fig. 6 of TS15, TS16, TS19, and TS20. The activated 
C-H bonds are shorter than these involved in the first hydrogen activation in propane, as 
shown in Fig. 6, and the newly formed H-O bonds are longer accordingly. Its apparent 
that lower energies are needed to activate the second hydrogen, especially in the 
surface hydroxyl involved reactions, and the activation energies are even lower than 
that on clean Pt(111) surface.

Fig. 8 Intermediates formed on hydroxylated and oxygenated platinum surfaces. 
When dehydrogenation of propane by surface hydroxyl and oxygen atom are 
compared, it is found that the first H abstraction reactions are the rate limiting steps in 
both cases, which is in consistence with results obtained by DFT studies for oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
of 
propane 
over 
vanadium 
oxide54-56 
but 
differs 
from 
dehydrogenation of propane over Pt(111) surface37. Surface hydroxyl is more active 
than atomic oxygen species from the kinetic point of view since lower energy barrier 
is needed to break C-H bond. Moreover, the consecutive two H abstracting reactions 
by surface hydroxyl are all exothermic. So it is also thermodynamically more 
favorable than dehydrogenation by surface O. But, among all the three mechanism 
discussed above, the essential role of surface OH is achieved most likely through 
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, since the activation energies for this mechanism 
have the relative low values. 
5. Discussion 
The increase of catalytic activity and decrease of apparent activation energies are

observed in experiments when introducing steam in the PDH reaction. But the DFT 
results stated above shows that co-adsorbing with oxygenated species can shift the 
activation energies to higher values due to the repulsion among the co-adsorption 
species. For the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, the activations of the first C-H 
bonds in propane are not facilitated because of stereospecific blockade. In some 
specific steps, e.g. i-propyl dehydrogenating to propylene, surface OH can help to 
activate C-H bond of methyl group due to the electronic interactions. For Eley-Rideal 
mechanism, although the second step of C-H bond activation by surface OH is 
slightly kinetically favored, the first step of C-H bond abstraction gives high energy 
barriers of 0.88 eV and 1.08 eV for i-propyl and n-propyl radical producing, 
respectively. Therefore, the DFT results do not seem to support the conclusion of 
alternation in reaction pathways for PDH in the presence of steam. 
It should be noticed that adsorption of water on the Pt surface would change the 
surface coverage of different species and therefore affect the reaction rate. For PDH 
over Pt catalyst, Chen et al57. found the reaction order to hydrogen is -0.5, which 
indicates that lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage will lead to the 
increase of the reaction rate. This phenomenon is also supported by the previous DFT 
results21. But, the water adsorption on Pt(111) is weak and may have a low surface 
coverage, which would limit the effect of steam in a certain range. As is shown in 
Fig.9, hydrogen order to PDH reaction remains nearly unchanged in steam 
atmosphere since the hydrogen order to PDH reaction can be expressed as follows31:

Another advantages of steam for PDH is that steam could contribute to lower 
coking rate25,58,59, which is justified by our TG analysis of the spent catalysts, as 
shown in Table 4. The decrease of coking rate in the presence of steam contributes to 
the increase of catalytic activity, since more Pt(111) surface may be free for the 
reaction21. Furthermore, It should be noted that when steam is introduced, the 
selectivity loss of propene mainly goes to cracking products, in accordance with other 
authors28,60. Yang et al37,61 and  y  nen et al62 have shown that lower coordinated Pt 
sites, like step sites, are highly active but are not selective for PDH reaction. On these

sites, cracking products and coking reaction prevail. Therefore, mono-metallic Pt 
catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15, 63-66. When steam is introduced, the removal 
of cokes will help recover and maintain these highly active Pt sites and increase the 
catalysts activity and decrease the selectivity to propene at the same time. Since 
propane dehydrogenation on these sites have lower activation energies37, 62, it can also 
account for the experimentally observed decrease in activation energies67.  
Finally, it should be noted that the change of propane dehydrogenation activities 
is also related to the catalysts structures. It was found by Luu et al29 that steam was 
involved in the dominator of their kinetic model with a second order over tin 
promoted Pt/γ-Al2O3, indicating that H2O was adsorbed on active sites. But for their 
Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst without tin addition, the dehydrogenating rates were hardly 
dependent on the partial pressure of steam, revealing that the effects of steam might 
depend on different support24,67 and catalysts composition24,29,67.  
6. Conclusion 
A combined experimental and theoretical study of the effect of steam on 
propane dehydrogenation was performed. The experimental results show that addition 
of steam in the PDH reaction will increase the catalysts activities, lower 
dehydrogenating activation energies and coking rate. Compared with dehydrogenation 
over clean Pt(111) surface, the DFT results show that the energy barriers of different 
dehydrogenation steps are elevated due to the adsorption of water and its dissociated 
species. The only exception is for i-propyl dehydrogenating to propene step with the 
involvement of surface -OH through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal

mechanism. For PDH under steam atmosphere, the role of surface OH is essential, 
most likely through Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the first C-H bond 
activation is the rate determining step in the overall PDH reaction route. The 
promoting effect of steam can be ascribed to the removal of cokes deposited on active 
Pt surfaces and the changes of adsorption species coverage on Pt surface.
