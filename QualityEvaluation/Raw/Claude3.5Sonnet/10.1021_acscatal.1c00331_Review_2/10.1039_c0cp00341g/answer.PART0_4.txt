[1] "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

[2] "However, under realistic experimental conditions, H atoms are coadsorbed with propylene, which can weaken the chemisorption of propylene and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it suggests that coadsorbed hydrogen atoms can affect the process in two main ways:

1. Increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation
2. Promote the desorption of propylene

These effects could potentially improve selectivity towards propylene by suppressing further dehydrogenation and facilitating propylene release from the catalyst surface. However, the document does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding impacts coke formation, catalyst stability, or other specific reaction mechanisms. The overall implications for process efficiency and performance are not explicitly discussed in the given text.

该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的全面信息。然而，它暗示共吸附的氢原子可能通过两种主要方式影响该过程：

1. 增加丙烯脱氢的活化能
2. 促进丙烯的脱附

这些效应可能通过抑制进一步脱氢和促进丙烯从催化剂表面释放来提高丙烯的选择性。然而，该文档并未直接说明氢气共进料如何影响焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性或其他具体反应机制。文中没有明确讨论对整体工艺效率和性能的影响。
