[1] "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does suggest that coadsorbed hydrogen atoms could have two effects:

1. Increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation
2. Promote propylene desorption

These effects could potentially reduce coke formation by suppressing further dehydrogenation of propylene and promoting its desorption instead. This may improve catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene. However, the literature does not discuss the full implications for overall process efficiency and performance, nor does it address aspects like acid site conversions or graphitization patterns. More research would be needed to fully answer the question.

文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢过程中氢气共进料的全面信息。然而,它确实暗示共吸附的氢原子可能有两个作用:

1. 增加丙烯脱氢的活化能
2. 促进丙烯脱附

这些效应可能通过抑制丙烯的进一步脱氢并促进其脱附来减少焦炭的形成。这可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和对丙烯的选择性。然而,文献并未讨论对整体过程效率和性能的全面影响,也没有涉及酸性位点转化或石墨化模式等方面。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答这个问题。
