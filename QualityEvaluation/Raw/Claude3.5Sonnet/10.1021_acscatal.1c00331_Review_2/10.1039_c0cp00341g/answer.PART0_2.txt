[1] "Under realistic experimental conditions, H atoms are coadsorbed with propylene, which can weaken the chemisorption of propylene and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene."

[2] "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process and its effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. However, based on the limited information provided, we can infer some potential effects:

1. Hydrogen cofeeding may help reduce coke formation by promoting the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface. This could prevent propylene from undergoing further dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coke precursors.

2. The presence of coadsorbed hydrogen atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation. This could slow down the deep dehydrogenation process, potentially improving catalyst stability by reducing coke formation.

3. Hydrogen cofeeding might improve the overall selectivity towards propylene by weakening its chemisorption on the catalyst surface and promoting its desorption. This could lead to higher propylene yields and improved process efficiency.

4. The impact of hydrogen on acid site conversions and graphitization is not directly addressed in the given literature.

5. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the implications for overall process efficiency and performance, the potential reduction in coke formation and improved selectivity towards propylene suggest that hydrogen cofeeding could have positive effects on the PDH process.

It's important to note that these inferences are based on limited information, and further research would be needed to fully understand the comprehensive effects of hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的全面信息。但是，根据所提供的有限信息，我们可以推断出一些潜在的影响：

1. 氢气共进料可能通过促进丙烯从催化剂表面脱附来帮助减少焦炭形成。这可能会防止丙烯进一步发生导致焦炭前体的脱氢反应。

2. 共吸附的氢原子的存在可能会增加丙烯脱氢的活化能。这可能会减缓深度脱氢过程，通过减少焦炭形成来潜在地提高催化剂稳定性。

3. 氢气共进料可能通过减弱丙烯在催化剂表面的化学吸附并促进其脱附来提高丙烯的整体选择性。这可能会导致更高的丙烯产率和改善的过程效率。

4. 给定的文献中没有直接讨论氢气对酸性位转化和石墨化的影响。

5. 虽然文献没有明确讨论对整体过程效率和性能的影响，但焦炭形成的潜在减少和丙烯选择性的改善表明，氢气共进料可能对PDH过程产生积极影响。

需要注意的是，这些推断是基于有限的信息，需要进一步的研究才能全面了解氢气共进料在PDH过程中的综合影响。
