[1] "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it suggests that coadsorbed hydrogen atoms may have two effects:

1. Increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation
2. Promote propylene desorption

These effects could potentially reduce coke formation by inhibiting further dehydrogenation of propylene and encouraging propylene to desorb from the catalyst surface. This may improve catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene. However, the document does not discuss detailed mechanisms, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization related to hydrogen cofeeding. More research would be needed to fully understand the implications for overall process efficiency and performance.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢中的全面信息。然而,它暗示共吸附的氢原子可能有两个作用:

1. 增加丙烯脱氢的活化能
2. 促进丙烯脱附

这些效果可能通过抑制丙烯的进一步脱氢和鼓励丙烯从催化剂表面脱附来减少积炭形成。这可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和对丙烯的选择性。然而,该文档并未讨论与氢气共进料相关的详细机制、积炭积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化。需要进行更多研究以充分了解对整体工艺效率和性能的影响。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it suggests that coadsorbed hydrogen atoms can affect the process in two main ways:

1. Increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, which may help reduce further dehydrogenation and coke formation.

2. Promote propylene desorption by weakening its chemisorption on the catalyst surface.

These effects could potentially improve catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene. However, the document does not discuss specific impacts on coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More research would be needed to fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on PDH performance.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的全面信息。然而，它暗示共吸附的氢原子可以通过两种主要方式影响该过程：

1. 增加丙烯脱氢的活化能，这可能有助于减少进一步的脱氢和积碳形成。

2. 通过削弱丙烯在催化剂表面的化学吸附来促进丙烯的脱附。

这些效果可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和对丙烯的选择性。然而，该文档并未讨论对积碳积累模式、酸性位转化、石墨化或整体工艺效率的具体影响。需要更多的研究才能充分理解氢气共进料对PDH性能的影响。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process and its effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. However, based on the limited information provided, we can infer some potential effects:

1. Hydrogen cofeeding may help reduce coke formation by promoting the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface. This could prevent propylene from undergoing further dehydrogenation reactions that lead to coke precursors.

2. The presence of coadsorbed hydrogen atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation. This could slow down the deep dehydrogenation process, potentially improving catalyst stability by reducing coke formation.

3. Hydrogen cofeeding might improve the overall selectivity towards propylene by weakening its chemisorption on the catalyst surface and promoting its desorption. This could lead to higher propylene yields and improved process efficiency.

4. The impact of hydrogen on acid site conversions and graphitization is not directly addressed in the given literature.

5. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the implications for overall process efficiency and performance, the potential reduction in coke formation and improved selectivity towards propylene suggest that hydrogen cofeeding could have positive effects on the PDH process.

It's important to note that these inferences are based on limited information, and further research would be needed to fully understand the comprehensive effects of hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的全面信息。但是，根据所提供的有限信息，我们可以推断出一些潜在的影响：

1. 氢气共进料可能通过促进丙烯从催化剂表面脱附来帮助减少焦炭形成。这可能会防止丙烯进一步发生导致焦炭前体的脱氢反应。

2. 共吸附的氢原子的存在可能会增加丙烯脱氢的活化能。这可能会减缓深度脱氢过程，通过减少焦炭形成来潜在地提高催化剂稳定性。

3. 氢气共进料可能通过减弱丙烯在催化剂表面的化学吸附并促进其脱附来提高丙烯的整体选择性。这可能会导致更高的丙烯产率和改善的过程效率。

4. 给定的文献中没有直接讨论氢气对酸性位转化和石墨化的影响。

5. 虽然文献没有明确讨论对整体过程效率和性能的影响，但焦炭形成的潜在减少和丙烯选择性的改善表明，氢气共进料可能对PDH过程产生积极影响。

需要注意的是，这些推断是基于有限的信息，需要进一步的研究才能全面了解氢气共进料在PDH过程中的综合影响。

These effects could potentially reduce coke formation by suppressing further dehydrogenation of propylene and promoting its desorption instead. This may improve catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene. However, the literature does not discuss the full implications for overall process efficiency and performance, nor does it address aspects like acid site conversions or graphitization patterns.
