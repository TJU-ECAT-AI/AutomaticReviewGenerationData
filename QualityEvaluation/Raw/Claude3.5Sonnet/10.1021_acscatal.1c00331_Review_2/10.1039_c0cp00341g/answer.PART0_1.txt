[1] "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

[2] "However, under realistic experimental conditions, H atoms are coadsorbed with propylene, which can weaken the chemisorption of propylene and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it suggests that coadsorbed hydrogen atoms can affect the process in two main ways:

1. Increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, which may help reduce further dehydrogenation and coke formation.

2. Promote propylene desorption by weakening its chemisorption on the catalyst surface.

These effects could potentially improve catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene. However, the document does not discuss specific impacts on coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More research would be needed to fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on PDH performance.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的全面信息。然而，它暗示共吸附的氢原子可以通过两种主要方式影响该过程：

1. 增加丙烯脱氢的活化能，这可能有助于减少进一步的脱氢和积碳形成。

2. 通过削弱丙烯在催化剂表面的化学吸附来促进丙烯的脱附。

这些效果可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和对丙烯的选择性。然而，该文档并未讨论对积碳积累模式、酸性位转化、石墨化或整体工艺效率的具体影响。需要更多的研究才能充分理解氢气共进料对PDH性能的影响。
