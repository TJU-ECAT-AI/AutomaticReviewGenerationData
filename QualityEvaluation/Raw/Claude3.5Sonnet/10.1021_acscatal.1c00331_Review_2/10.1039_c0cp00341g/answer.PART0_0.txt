[1] "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption of propylene under realistic experimental conditions."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it suggests that coadsorbed hydrogen atoms may have two effects:

1. Increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation
2. Promote propylene desorption

These effects could potentially reduce coke formation by inhibiting further dehydrogenation of propylene and encouraging propylene to desorb from the catalyst surface. This may improve catalyst stability and selectivity towards propylene. However, the document does not discuss detailed mechanisms, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization related to hydrogen cofeeding. More research would be needed to fully understand the implications for overall process efficiency and performance.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢中的全面信息。然而,它暗示共吸附的氢原子可能有两个作用:

1. 增加丙烯脱氢的活化能
2. 促进丙烯脱附

这些效果可能通过抑制丙烯的进一步脱氢和鼓励丙烯从催化剂表面脱附来减少积炭形成。这可能会提高催化剂的稳定性和对丙烯的选择性。然而,该文档并未讨论与氢气共进料相关的详细机制、积炭积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化。需要进行更多研究以充分了解对整体工艺效率和性能的影响。
