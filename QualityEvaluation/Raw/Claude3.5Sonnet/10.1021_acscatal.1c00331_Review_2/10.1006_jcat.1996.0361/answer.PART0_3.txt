[1] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

[2] "We suggest that the major part of the coke is not responsible for the deactivation. Instead we propose a model where the coke active in deactivating the catalyst is formed in parallel with the main coke formation."

[3] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation. On the other hand, it was not possible to remove any coke after the reaction stopped."

[4] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

[5] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke precursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation"

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke formation prevention: Hydrogen is highly effective in suppressing coke formation during the PDH reaction. It inhibits the formation of coke precursors, thereby reducing the overall coke accumulation on the catalyst.

2. Catalyst stability improvement: By preventing coke formation, hydrogen helps maintain the activity of the catalyst over time. This leads to improved catalyst stability and longer operation times before deactivation occurs.

3. Reaction mechanism impact: Hydrogen likely affects the reaction mechanism by altering the energy barriers for certain steps. It may inhibit side reactions that lead to coke precursor formation, thus favoring the main dehydrogenation pathway.

4. Coke accumulation patterns: The study suggests that there are different types of coke, with some forming on the metal and others on the carrier. Hydrogen appears to suppress the formation of all types of coke during the reaction.

5. Acid site conversions: While not explicitly mentioned, hydrogen may affect acid site conversions by altering the surface chemistry of the catalyst, potentially reducing coke formation on acidic sites.

6. Graphitization: The study identifies a graphitic type of coke forming on the carrier. Hydrogen cofeeding may help reduce the formation of this type of coke by suppressing its precursors.

7. Limitations: Despite its benefits during the reaction, hydrogen cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst after the reaction has stopped. This suggests that regular regeneration of the catalyst may still be necessary.

8. Process efficiency implications: By maintaining catalyst activity and reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding can significantly improve the overall efficiency of the PDH process. It allows for longer operation times between catalyst regenerations and potentially higher propene yields.

9. Performance enhancement: The use of hydrogen in the PDH process enhances the performance by reducing unwanted side reactions and maintaining catalyst activity, which can lead to improved selectivity towards the desired propene product.

In conclusion, hydrogen cofeeding in PDH is a valuable strategy for improving process efficiency and performance by mitigating coke formation and maintaining catalyst activity, although it does not eliminate the need for eventual catalyst regeneration.

氢气在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个显著的影响：

1. 防止焦炭形成：氢气在PDH反应过程中高效抑制焦炭形成。它抑制了焦炭前体的形成，从而减少了催化剂上的整体焦炭积累。

2. 改善催化剂稳定性：通过防止焦炭形成，氢气有助于长期维持催化剂的活性。这导致催化剂稳定性提高，在失活前可以更长时间运行。

3. 反应机理影响：氢气可能通过改变某些步骤的能量障碍来影响反应机理。它可能抑制导致焦炭前体形成的副反应，从而有利于主要的脱氢途径。

4. 焦炭积累模式：研究表明存在不同类型的焦炭，有些形成在金属上，有些形成在载体上。氢气似乎能在反应过程中抑制所有类型焦炭的形成。

5. 酸性位点转化：虽然没有明确提及，但氢气可能通过改变催化剂的表面化学性质影响酸性位点转化，可能减少在酸性位点上的焦炭形成。

6. 石墨化：研究识别出在载体上形成的石墨型焦炭。氢气共进料可能通过抑制其前体来帮助减少这种类型焦炭的形成。

7. 局限性：尽管在反应过程中有益，但氢气无法去除反应停止后已经在催化剂上形成的焦炭。这表明可能仍需要定期再生催化剂。

8. 过程效率影响：通过维持催化剂活性和减少焦炭形成，氢气共进料可以显著提高PDH过程的整体效率。它允许在催化剂再生之间有更长的操作时间，并可能提高丙烯产率。

9. 性能增强：在PDH过程中使用氢气通过减少不需要的副反应和维持催化剂活性来增强性能，这可能导致对所需丙烯产品的选择性提高。

总之，在PDH中共进料氢气是一种通过减缓焦炭形成和维持催化剂活性来提高过程效率和性能的有价值策略，尽管它并不能消除最终需要催化剂再生的需求。
