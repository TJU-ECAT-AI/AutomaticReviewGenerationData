[1] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

[2] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

[3] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[4] "Figure 6a. It is obvious that adding propene increases the coke selectivity by reducing the dehydrogenation rate and increasing the coke formation. Again, it is obvious why adding propane will decrease the coke selectivity. However, it is worth noting that adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[5] "Next, a model relating the propane conversion integrated over 10 h to the experimental conditions was derived (see Fig. 6c). It showed that even if the addition of hydrogen was expected to decrease the initial conversion, the conversion integrated over the whole time period increased when the high hydrogen level was used. This effect was more pronounced at the high temperature."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen is highly effective in preventing coke formation. It suppresses the formation of coke precursors, thereby reducing the overall coke accumulation on the catalyst.

2. Catalyst stability: By preventing coke formation, hydrogen helps maintain catalyst activity over time. This leads to improved catalyst stability and longer operational periods before regeneration is required.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, meaning it reduces the tendency of the reaction to produce coke. This effect is more pronounced than its inhibition of the main dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Energy barriers: The literature does not directly discuss the impact of hydrogen on energy barriers.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: While hydrogen prevents new coke formation, it does not remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst.

6. Acid site conversions: The literature does not specifically mention the effect of hydrogen on acid site conversions.

7. Graphitization: The document does not provide information on how hydrogen affects graphitization of coke.

8. Process efficiency and performance: Despite potentially decreasing the initial conversion rate, hydrogen addition increases the overall propane conversion integrated over time, especially at higher temperatures. This suggests an improvement in long-term process efficiency and performance.

These effects imply that hydrogen cofeeding can significantly enhance the overall efficiency and performance of the PDH process by extending catalyst life, reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles, and maintaining higher conversion rates over longer periods. However, it's important to note that hydrogen cannot reverse existing coke formation, emphasizing the importance of continuous hydrogen presence during the reaction.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中添加氢气会对积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理产生以下几个重要影响：

1. 积碳形成：氢气在防止积碳形成方面非常有效。它抑制了积碳前体的形成，从而减少了催化剂上的整体积碳积累。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过防止积碳形成，氢气有助于长期维持催化剂活性。这导致催化剂稳定性提高，在需要再生之前可以有更长的操作周期。

3. 反应机理：氢气降低了积碳选择性，意味着它减少了反应产生积碳的倾向。这种效果比它对主要脱氢反应的抑制更为显著。

4. 能量障碍：文献没有直接讨论氢气对能量障碍的影响。

5. 积碳积累模式：虽然氢气可以防止新的积碳形成，但它不能去除已经在催化剂上形成的积碳。

6. 酸性位转化：文献没有特别提到氢气对酸性位转化的影响。

7. 石墨化：文档没有提供关于氢气如何影响积碳石墨化的信息。

8. 过程效率和性能：尽管可能会降低初始转化率，但氢气的添加会增加长时间内的整体丙烷转化率，尤其是在较高温度下。这表明长期过程效率和性能得到了改善。

这些影响意味着在PDH过程中添加氢气可以通过延长催化剂寿命、减少再生周期频率和长期维持较高的转化率来显著提高整体效率和性能。然而，需要注意的是，氢气不能逆转已经形成的积碳，这强调了在反应过程中持续存在氢气的重要性。
