Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

<quotes>

[1] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

[2] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

[3] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[4] "During the reaction, on the other hand, the formation of coke precursors is suppressed by hydrogen, and what Biswas et al. called reversible coke, can be removed by hydrogenation"

[5] "Adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several important effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke prevention: Hydrogen is highly effective at preventing coke formation during the PDH reaction. It suppresses the formation of coke precursors, thereby reducing the overall amount of coke deposited on the catalyst.

2. Catalyst stability: By preventing coke formation, hydrogen helps maintain catalyst activity over time. This leads to improved catalyst stability and longer run times before deactivation occurs.

3. Reaction rate: While hydrogen does inhibit the PDH reaction rate to some extent, its coke prevention effect is more significant. This results in an overall decrease in coke selectivity when hydrogen is added.

4. Coke removal limitations: Although hydrogen is effective at preventing coke formation, it cannot remove coke that has already formed and deposited on the catalyst surface during the reaction.

5. Reversible coke: Hydrogen can potentially remove some forms of "reversible coke" during the reaction, but it is not effective at removing more stable, dehydrogenated coke species that form over longer reaction times or at higher temperatures.

6. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen likely increases the energy barrier for coke formation reactions, making them less favorable thermodynamically.

7. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen cofeeding may alter the distribution and nature of coke deposits on the catalyst surface, potentially favoring less detrimental forms of coke.

8. Acid site effects: Hydrogen may interact with acid sites on the catalyst support, potentially reducing their activity in coke-forming side reactions.

9. Graphitization: By suppressing coke precursor formation, hydrogen may reduce the extent of coke graphitization over time, which could otherwise lead to more stable and difficult-to-remove coke deposits.

The implications of these effects on overall process efficiency and performance are significant. Hydrogen cofeeding can lead to improved catalyst longevity, reduced regeneration frequency, and more stable operation. However, it also introduces additional costs and complexity to the process. Optimizing the hydrogen cofeed rate is crucial to balance its positive effects on coke prevention with its negative impact on reaction rates and process economics.

氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个重要影响：

1. 防止焦炭形成：氢气在PDH反应过程中非常有效地防止焦炭形成。它抑制了焦炭前体的形成，从而减少了沉积在催化剂上的总焦炭量。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过防止焦炭形成，氢气有助于长期维持催化剂活性。这导致催化剂稳定性提高，在失活前可以运行更长时间。

3. 反应速率：虽然氢气在一定程度上抑制了PDH反应速率，但其防止焦炭形成的效果更为显著。这导致添加氢气时焦炭选择性整体降低。

4. 焦炭去除限制：尽管氢气能有效防止焦炭形成，但它无法去除反应过程中已经形成并沉积在催化剂表面上的焦炭。

5. 可逆焦炭：氢气可能在反应过程中去除一些形式的"可逆焦炭"，但对于在较长反应时间或较高温度下形成的更稳定、脱氢的焦炭物种，则不太有效。

6. 能量障碍：氢气的存在可能会增加焦炭形成反应的能量障碍，使这些反应在热力学上不太有利。

7. 焦炭积累模式：氢气共进料可能会改变催化剂表面焦炭沉积的分布和性质，可能有利于形成危害较小的焦炭形式。

8. 酸性位点影响：氢气可能与催化剂载体上的酸性位点相互作用，可能降低它们在形成焦炭的副反应中的活性。

9. 石墨化：通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，氢气可能会减少随时间推移焦炭的石墨化程度，否则可能会导致更稳定和难以去除的焦炭沉积。

这些效果对整体过程效率和性能的影响是显著的。氢气共进料可以延长催化剂寿命，减少再生频率，并使操作更稳定。然而，它也给过程带来了额外的成本和复杂性。优化氢气共进料速率对于平衡其在防止焦炭方面的积极效果与其对反应速率和过程经济性的负面影响至关重要。
