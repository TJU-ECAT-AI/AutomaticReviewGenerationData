[1] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

[2] "The conclusion must be that hydrogen is active in preventing coke formation but does not remove any significant amount of coke already formed."

[3] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[4] "Figure 6a demonstrates how adding hydrogen decreases the coke selectivity, because the coke prevention effect is larger than the inhibition of the reaction rate."

[5] "The model showed that hydrogen helps maintain the activity. However, increased propene partial pressure and higher temperature increased the deactivation."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several significant effects:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen is highly effective at preventing coke formation by suppressing coke precursor formation. It reduces the overall coke selectivity and amount of coke deposited on the catalyst.

2. Catalyst stability: Hydrogen helps maintain catalyst activity and reduces the deactivation rate. It is efficient in preserving catalyst performance over time.

3. Reaction mechanisms: While hydrogen inhibits the main dehydrogenation reaction to some extent, its coke prevention effect is more pronounced, resulting in a net positive impact on catalyst stability.

4. Energy barriers: The literature does not directly address how hydrogen affects energy barriers.

5. Coke accumulation patterns: Hydrogen prevents initial coke formation but cannot remove coke that has already formed and deposited on the catalyst.

6. Acid site conversions: The literature does not specifically mention hydrogen's effect on acid site conversions.

7. Graphitization: The literature does not discuss hydrogen's impact on graphitization.

8. Process efficiency and performance: By maintaining catalyst activity and reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding improves overall process efficiency and performance of the PDH process. It allows for longer catalyst lifetimes and more stable operation.

However, it's important to note that while hydrogen is effective at preventing coke formation, it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. This suggests that periodic regeneration or other coke removal strategies may still be necessary for long-term catalyst performance.

氢气在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的共进料有几个显著的影响：

1. 积炭形成：氢气通过抑制积炭前驱体的形成，非常有效地防止了积炭的形成。它降低了总体积炭选择性和沉积在催化剂上的积炭量。

2. 催化剂稳定性：氢气有助于维持催化剂活性并降低失活速率。它能有效地保持催化剂长期性能。

3. 反应机理：虽然氢气在一定程度上抑制了主要的脱氢反应，但其防止积炭的效果更为显著，对催化剂稳定性产生了净正面影响。

4. 能量障碍：文献中没有直接提到氢气如何影响能量障碍。

5. 积炭累积模式：氢气可以防止初始积炭形成，但无法去除已经形成并沉积在催化剂上的积炭。

6. 酸性位点转化：文献没有具体提到氢气对酸性位点转化的影响。

7. 石墨化：文献没有讨论氢气对石墨化的影响。

8. 过程效率和性能：通过维持催化剂活性和减少积炭形成，氢气共进料提高了PDH过程的整体效率和性能。它允许更长的催化剂寿命和更稳定的操作。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然氢气在防止积炭形成方面很有效，但它无法去除已经在催化剂上形成的积炭。这表明，对于长期催化剂性能，可能仍然需要定期再生或其他积炭去除策略。
