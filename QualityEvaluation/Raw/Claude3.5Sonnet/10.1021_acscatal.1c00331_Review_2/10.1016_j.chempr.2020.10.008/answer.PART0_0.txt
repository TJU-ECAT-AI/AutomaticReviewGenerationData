[1] "Increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10)."

[2] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does indicate that increasing H2 pressures contributes to improving propylene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding likely helps suppress side reactions and coke formation, thereby enhancing catalyst stability and process efficiency.

The text also mentions that the PtZn/SiO2 catalyst showed lower coke amounts and graphitization degrees compared to PtZn/Al2O3, implying better resistance to coking. While not directly linked to hydrogen cofeeding, this observation suggests that catalyst composition and support material play important roles in coke formation patterns and overall catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or detailed reaction mechanisms in PDH. To fully answer the question, more targeted studies on the effects of hydrogen partial pressure on these aspects would be needed.

文献对氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中的具体影响提供了有限的信息。但它确实表明，增加氢气压力有助于提高丙烯选择性。这表明氢气共进料可能有助于抑制副反应和焦炭形成，从而提高催化剂稳定性和过程效率。

文本还提到，与PtZn/Al2O3相比，PtZn/SiO2催化剂显示出较低的焦炭量和石墨化程度，这意味着对结焦有更好的抗性。虽然这一观察结果与氢气共进料没有直接关系，但它表明催化剂成分和载体材料在焦炭形成模式和整体催化剂稳定性方面起着重要作用。

文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响PDH中的能量障碍、酸性位转化或详细反应机理的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对氢分压对这些方面的影响进行更有针对性的研究。
