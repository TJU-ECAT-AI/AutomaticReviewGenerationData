[1] "Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-determining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/SiO2, respectively"

[2] "The formation of CH4 as a result of cracking and coke side reactions at HT was significantly inhibited with the addition of Zn over PtZn/SiO2, which might signify the higher propylene selectivity and anti-coke resistance."

[3] "As a result, increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity"

The literature provides some insights into how hydrogen cofeeding affects the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process:

1. Hydrogen cofeeding contributes to improved propylene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen helps suppress undesired side reactions that would otherwise reduce propylene yield.

2. The addition of hydrogen, along with zinc, significantly inhibits the formation of methane from cracking and coking side reactions at high temperatures. This indicates that hydrogen cofeeding enhances the catalyst's resistance to coke formation and improves its stability.

3. Hydrogen affects the kinetics of the reaction, slightly increasing the temperature at which CH bond cleavage begins on the PtZn catalyst compared to Pt alone. This suggests hydrogen may modify the energy barriers of certain reaction steps.

However, the literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen impacts specific energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization. More in-depth studies would be needed to fully understand these aspects and their implications for overall process efficiency and performance. The available information suggests that hydrogen cofeeding generally has a positive impact on catalyst stability and selectivity in the PDH process.

文献对氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程提供了一些见解：

1. 氢气共进料有助于提高丙烯选择性。这表明氢气有助于抑制原本会降低丙烯产率的不良副反应。

2. 在高温下，氢气的添加与锌一起显著抑制了由裂解和结焦副反应形成的甲烷。这表明氢气共进料增强了催化剂抗结焦的能力，提高了其稳定性。

3. 氢气影响反应动力学，使PtZn催化剂上CH键断裂开始的温度略高于单独的Pt催化剂。这表明氢气可能修改了某些反应步骤的能量障碍。

然而，文献并未提供氢气如何影响特定能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的详细信息。需要更深入的研究才能充分理解这些方面及其对整体工艺效率和性能的影响。现有信息表明，氢气共进料总体上对PDH过程中的催化剂稳定性和选择性产生积极影响。
