[1] "Increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10)."

[2] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH. However, it does indicate that increasing H2 pressures contributes to improving propylene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding likely helps suppress side reactions and coke formation.

The text also mentions that the PtZn/SiO2 catalyst showed lower coke amounts and graphitization degree compared to PtZn/Al2O3. While not directly linked to hydrogen cofeeding, this implies that the catalyst formulation and support play important roles in coke resistance.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding appears to have positive effects on catalyst stability and selectivity in PDH, likely by inhibiting coke formation and undesired side reactions. However, the exact mechanisms and impacts on energy barriers are not detailed in the given literature. Further studies would be needed to fully elucidate the effects of hydrogen on reaction pathways, acid site conversions, and overall process efficiency in PDH.

文献对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中氢气共进料的具体影响提供了有限的信息。但是，它确实表明增加氢气压力有助于提高丙烯选择性。这表明氢气共进料可能有助于抑制副反应和焦炭形成。

文本还提到，与PtZn/Al2O3相比，PtZn/SiO2催化剂显示出较低的焦炭量和石墨化程度。虽然这与氢气共进料没有直接联系，但它暗示催化剂配方和载体在抗焦炭方面起着重要作用。

总的来说，氢气共进料似乎对PDH中的催化剂稳定性和选择性有积极影响，可能是通过抑制焦炭形成和不需要的副反应。然而，给定的文献中没有详细说明对能量障碍的确切机制和影响。需要进一步研究才能充分阐明氢气对PDH中反应途径、酸位转化和整体过程效率的影响。
