[1] "Increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10)."

[2] "Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3."

The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that increasing H2 pressures contributes to improving propylene selectivity. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding may help suppress side reactions and improve catalyst selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

The text also notes that the PtZn/SiO2 catalyst showed lower coke formation and graphitization compared to PtZn/Al2O3, though this is attributed to support effects rather than hydrogen cofeeding specifically. 

The document does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen affects energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or specific reaction mechanisms. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully address the question's scope regarding the impacts of hydrogen cofeeding on PDH catalysis and process efficiency.

文献对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中氢气共进料的具体影响提供了有限的信息。然而，它确实提到增加H2压力有助于提高丙烯选择性。这表明氢气共进料可能有助于抑制副反应，提高催化剂对所需丙烯产物的选择性。

文本还指出，PtZn/SiO2催化剂与PtZn/Al2O3相比，显示出较低的积碳形成和石墨化程度，尽管这被归因于载体效应，而不是特别归因于氢气共进料。

该文档没有提供关于氢气如何影响能量障碍、积碳积累模式、酸性位转化或特定反应机理的详细信息。需要更全面的研究才能充分解决该问题涉及的氢气共进料对PDH催化和过程效率影响的范围。
