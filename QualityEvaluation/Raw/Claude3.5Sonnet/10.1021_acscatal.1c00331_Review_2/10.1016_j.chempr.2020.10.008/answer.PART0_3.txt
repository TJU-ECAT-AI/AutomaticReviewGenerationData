[1] "Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-determining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/SiO2, respectively (Figure S7), revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the CH activation temperature."

[2] "The formation of CH4 as a result of cracking and coke side reactions at HT was significantly inhibited with the addition of Zn over PtZn/SiO2, which might signify the higher propylene selectivity and anti-coke resistance."

[3] "As a result, increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10)."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several important effects:

1. It improves propylene selectivity, likely by inhibiting side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. It enhances catalyst stability by reducing coke accumulation. The addition of Zn and H2 significantly inhibits the formation of methane, which is a product of cracking and coking reactions.

3. It affects reaction mechanisms by slightly increasing the C-H activation temperature when Zn is present. This suggests H2 may modify the energetics of the rate-determining step.

4. Higher H2 pressures contribute to improved propylene selectivity, indicating a beneficial impact on reaction pathways.

While the document does not provide specific details on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization patterns, the overall implication is that hydrogen cofeeding improves process efficiency and performance by enhancing selectivity and catalyst longevity through coke suppression.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中有几个重要影响：

1. 它提高了丙烯的选择性，可能是通过抑制导致焦炭形成的副反应。

2. 它通过减少焦炭积累来增强催化剂的稳定性。添加锌和氢气显著抑制了甲烷的形成，而甲烷是裂解和结焦反应的产物。

3. 当存在锌时，它会稍微提高C-H活化温度，从而影响反应机理。这表明氢气可能会改变速率决定步骤的能量学。

4. 较高的氢气压力有助于提高丙烯选择性，表明对反应途径有有益影响。

虽然文献没有提供关于能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化模式的具体细节，但总体含义是氢气共进料通过提高选择性和通过抑制焦炭形成来延长催化剂寿命，从而提高了过程效率和性能。
