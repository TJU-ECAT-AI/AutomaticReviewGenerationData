[1] "Comparison of Figs. 10 and 14 shows that the amount of carbon deposited on Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48 after 2 h of time on stream is roughly the same during ethane and propane deposition, C/Pt  25."

[2] "These observations were attributed to the greater ease with which precursors to the carbonaceous deposit produced from ethane rather than propane could migrate from the metallic particles where they are formed onto the support."

[3] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on propane dehydrogenation. However, we can infer some potential impacts based on the information provided:

1. Hydrogen cofeeding may reduce coke formation by promoting hydrogenation of coke precursors. This could potentially improve catalyst stability by reducing carbon accumulation on both the support and PtIn nanoparticles.

2. The presence of hydrogen could affect reaction mechanisms by altering the energy barriers for dehydrogenation versus hydrogenation reactions. This may impact the overall process efficiency and selectivity.

3. Hydrogen cofeeding might influence the migration of carbon precursors from metal particles to the support. It could potentially make it easier for carbon species to migrate, similar to what was observed for ethane compared to propane.

4. The graphitization process and size of carbon domains formed might be affected by the presence of hydrogen, potentially altering the nature and impact of coke deposits.

5. Hydrogen cofeeding could potentially reduce the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may help maintain catalyst activity over time.

Overall, while the document does not provide direct information on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH, it suggests that factors affecting coke formation, migration, and accumulation can significantly impact catalyst performance and stability. Hydrogen cofeeding would likely influence these processes, potentially leading to improved catalyst longevity and process efficiency.

该文献并未直接提及氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢的影响。但是，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断一些潜在的影响：

1. 氢气共进料可能通过促进焦炭前体物的加氢来减少焦炭形成。这可能会通过减少碳在载体和PtIn纳米颗粒上的积累来提高催化剂的稳定性。

2. 氢气的存在可能会通过改变脱氢反应与加氢反应的能量障碍来影响反应机理。这可能会影响整个过程的效率和选择性。

3. 氢气共进料可能会影响碳前体物从金属颗粒迁移到载体的过程。它可能会使碳物种更容易迁移，类似于观察到的乙烷与丙烷的比较结果。

4. 氢气的存在可能会影响石墨化过程和形成的碳域大小，从而可能改变焦炭沉积的性质和影响。

5. 氢气共进料可能会减少催化剂表面酸性位点的转化，这可能有助于长期维持催化剂活性。

总的来说，虽然文档没有提供关于PDH中氢气共进料的直接信息，但它表明影响焦炭形成、迁移和积累的因素可以显著影响催化剂性能和稳定性。氢气共进料可能会影响这些过程，从而可能提高催化剂寿命和过程效率。
