[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."

[2] "Measurements of catalyst activity and selectivity were carried out at 873 K, using 0.025 g of catalyst and a feed consisting of 20% ethane or propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance He flowing at 60 cm3/min"

[3] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[4] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[5] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide detailed information about how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made based on the available information:

1. The experiments were conducted with 25% hydrogen in the feed, indicating that hydrogen cofeeding was used in the study.

2. Coke deposition was observed for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, but alloying Pt with In significantly reduced the amount of coke deposited.

3. The impact of coke on catalyst activity differed between ethane and propane dehydrogenation. For ethane, coke deposition did not affect activity, while for propane, it caused a loss in activity.

4. The difference in coke impact is attributed to the varying ease with which coke migrates from PtIn nanoparticles to the support, with migration being easier for ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

While the study does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it suggests that the presence of hydrogen in the feed may play a role in coke formation and catalyst stability. The alloying of Pt with In appears to be a more significant factor in reducing coke formation than the presence of hydrogen alone. The study does not provide enough information to draw conclusions about the overall process efficiency and performance implications of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH.

文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何具体影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的详细信息。然而，根据可用信息可以得出一些相关观察：

1. 实验中使用了25%的氢气进料，表明研究中采用了氢气共进料。

2. 在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中都观察到了积碳沉积，但将Pt与In合金化显著减少了积碳的沉积量。

3. 积碳对催化剂活性的影响在乙烷和丙烷脱氢之间存在差异。对于乙烷，积碳沉积不影响活性，而对于丙烷，它导致活性下降。

4. 积碳影响的差异归因于积碳从PtIn纳米粒子迁移到载体的难易程度不同，与丙烷脱氢相比，乙烷脱氢过程中的迁移更容易。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响，但它表明进料中氢气的存在可能在积碳形成和催化剂稳定性方面起作用。Pt与In的合金化似乎是减少积碳形成的更重要因素，比单独存在氢气更为显著。该研究没有提供足够的信息来得出关于氢气共进料在PDH中对整体过程效率和性能影响的结论。
