[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."

[2] "Measurements of catalyst activity and selectivity were carried out at 873 K, using 0.025 g of catalyst and a feed consisting of 20% ethane or propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance He flowing at 60 cm3/min"

[3] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[4] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[5] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide detailed information about how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made based on the available information:

1. The experiments were conducted with 25% hydrogen in the feed, indicating that hydrogen cofeeding was used in the study.

2. Coke deposition was observed for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, but alloying Pt with In significantly reduced the amount of coke deposited.

3. The impact of coke on catalyst activity differed between ethane and propane dehydrogenation. For ethane, coke deposition did not affect activity, while for propane, it caused a loss in activity.

4. The difference in coke impact is attributed to the varying ease with which coke migrates from PtIn nanoparticles to the support, with migration being easier for ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

While the study does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it suggests that the presence of hydrogen in the feed may play a role in coke formation and catalyst stability. The alloying of Pt with In appears to be a more significant factor in reducing coke formation than the presence of hydrogen alone. The study does not provide enough information to draw conclusions about the overall process efficiency and performance implications of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH.

文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何具体影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的详细信息。然而，根据可用信息可以得出一些相关观察：

1. 实验中使用了25%的氢气进料，表明研究中采用了氢气共进料。

2. 在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中都观察到了积碳沉积，但将Pt与In合金化显著减少了积碳的沉积量。

3. 积碳对催化剂活性的影响在乙烷和丙烷脱氢之间存在差异。对于乙烷，积碳沉积不影响活性，而对于丙烷，它导致活性下降。

4. 积碳影响的差异归因于积碳从PtIn纳米粒子迁移到载体的难易程度不同，与丙烷脱氢相比，乙烷脱氢过程中的迁移更容易。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响，但它表明进料中氢气的存在可能在积碳形成和催化剂稳定性方面起作用。Pt与In的合金化似乎是减少积碳形成的更重要因素，比单独存在氢气更为显著。该研究没有提供足够的信息来得出关于氢气共进料在PDH中对整体过程效率和性能影响的结论。

The literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made:

1. Hydrogen was cofed during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation experiments, at 25% of the feed composition.

2. Alloying Pt with In significantly reduced coke deposition for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

3. While comparable amounts of coke were deposited for both reactions, the impact on catalyst activity differed. Coke had little effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity but caused activity loss for propane dehydrogenation.

4. This difference was attributed to coke migration patterns - coke produced during ethane dehydrogenation migrated more easily from PtIn nanoparticles to the support compared to coke from propane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not discuss specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about hydrogen's impacts on these aspects and overall process efficiency in PDH.

[1] "The amount of coke deposited was determined by combustion of the deposited material. Prior to combustion, the catalyst (0.025 g) was purged with flowing He (60 cm3/min) at 873 K for 5 min, and then exposed it to a mixture of 5% O2 in He flowing at 60 cm3/min."

The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant information can be inferred:

1. Hydrogen was cofed during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation experiments, making up 25% of the feed.

2. Coke deposition occurred during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, despite the presence of hydrogen in the feed.

3. Alloying Pt with In significantly reduced coke deposition for both reactions.

4. The amount of coke deposited was similar for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, but the effects on catalyst activity differed. Coke had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity.

5. This difference was attributed to the easier migration of coke from PtIn nanoparticles to the support during ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

While the literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alone may not be sufficient to prevent coke formation entirely. The alloying of Pt with In appears to have a more significant impact on reducing coke deposition. The study does not directly address the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance in PDH.

[1] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[3] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

The literature does not specifically address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does discuss coke formation and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation without hydrogen cofeeding. 

The study shows that alloying Pt with In significantly reduces coke deposition during propane dehydrogenation. The optimal catalyst composition (In/Pt ratio of 0.48) achieves maximum activity and nearly 100% selectivity to propene. 

Coke accumulation affects propane dehydrogenation more severely than ethane dehydrogenation, causing a loss in catalyst activity over time. This difference is attributed to the coke precursors formed during propane dehydrogenation being less mobile and more likely to remain on the PtIn nanoparticles rather than migrating to the support.

While the study does not directly examine hydrogen cofeeding, these findings suggest that strategies to enhance coke mobility or reduce its formation on active sites could improve catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation. Hydrogen cofeeding could potentially play such a role by affecting reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, or coke precursor formation, but further research would be needed to confirm its specific impacts in this catalyst system.

这篇文献没有具体讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢的影响。但是,它确实讨论了没有氢气共进料情况下丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成和催化剂稳定性。

研究表明,将Pt与In合金化显著降低了丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳沉积。最佳催化剂组成(In/Pt比为0.48)达到最大活性,丙烯选择性接近100%。

与乙烷脱氢相比,积碳累积对丙烷脱氢的影响更为严重,导致催化剂活性随时间降低。这种差异归因于丙烷脱氢过程中形成的积碳前体物移动性较差,更可能留在PtIn纳米粒子上,而不是迁移到载体上。

虽然该研究没有直接考察氢气共进料的影响,但这些发现表明,增强积碳移动性或减少其在活性位点上形成的策略可能会提高丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂的稳定性。氢气共进料可能通过影响反应机理、能量障碍或积碳前体物的形成来发挥这样的作用,但需要进一步的研究来确认它在这个催化剂系统中的具体影响。

[1] "Comparison of Figs. 10 and 14 shows that the amount of carbon deposited on Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48 after 2 h of time on stream is roughly the same during ethane and propane deposition, C/Pt  25."

[2] "These observations were attributed to the greater ease with which precursors to the carbonaceous deposit produced from ethane rather than propane could migrate from the metallic particles where they are formed onto the support."

[3] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on propane dehydrogenation. However, we can infer some potential impacts based on the information provided:

1. Hydrogen cofeeding may reduce coke formation by promoting hydrogenation of coke precursors. This could potentially improve catalyst stability by reducing carbon accumulation on both the support and PtIn nanoparticles.

2. The presence of hydrogen could affect reaction mechanisms by altering the energy barriers for dehydrogenation versus hydrogenation reactions. This may impact the overall process efficiency and selectivity.

3. Hydrogen cofeeding might influence the migration of carbon precursors from metal particles to the support. It could potentially make it easier for carbon species to migrate, similar to what was observed for ethane compared to propane.

4. The graphitization process and size of carbon domains formed might be affected by the presence of hydrogen, potentially altering the nature and impact of coke deposits.

5. Hydrogen cofeeding could potentially reduce the conversion of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which may help maintain catalyst activity over time.

Overall, while the document does not provide direct information on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH, it suggests that factors affecting coke formation, migration, and accumulation can significantly impact catalyst performance and stability. Hydrogen cofeeding would likely influence these processes, potentially leading to improved catalyst longevity and process efficiency.

该文献并未直接提及氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢的影响。但是，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断一些潜在的影响：

1. 氢气共进料可能通过促进焦炭前体物的加氢来减少焦炭形成。这可能会通过减少碳在载体和PtIn纳米颗粒上的积累来提高催化剂的稳定性。

2. 氢气的存在可能会通过改变脱氢反应与加氢反应的能量障碍来影响反应机理。这可能会影响整个过程的效率和选择性。

3. 氢气共进料可能会影响碳前体物从金属颗粒迁移到载体的过程。它可能会使碳物种更容易迁移，类似于观察到的乙烷与丙烷的比较结果。

4. 氢气的存在可能会影响石墨化过程和形成的碳域大小，从而可能改变焦炭沉积的性质和影响。

5. 氢气共进料可能会减少催化剂表面酸性位点的转化，这可能有助于长期维持催化剂活性。

总的来说，虽然文档没有提供关于PDH中氢气共进料的直接信息，但它表明影响焦炭形成、迁移和积累的因素可以显著影响催化剂性能和稳定性。氢气共进料可能会影响这些过程，从而可能提高催化剂寿命和过程效率。
