          [1] "Measurements of catalyst activity and selectivity were carried out at 873 K, using 0.025 g of catalyst and a feed consisting of 20% ethane or propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance He flowing at 60 cm3/min"

[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[3] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[4] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

          The literature does not provide direct information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made:

1. Hydrogen was cofed during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation experiments, at 25% of the feed composition.

2. Coke deposition occurred during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, despite the presence of hydrogen in the feed. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alone may not be sufficient to prevent coke formation entirely.

3. Alloying Pt with In significantly reduced coke deposition for both reactions, indicating that catalyst composition plays a crucial role in coke reduction.

4. While comparable amounts of coke were deposited for both reactions, the impact on catalyst activity differed. Coke had little effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity but caused activity loss for propane dehydrogenation.

5. This difference was attributed to coke migration patterns - coke produced during ethane dehydrogenation migrated more easily from PtIn nanoparticles to the support compared to coke from propane dehydrogenation.

6. The location of carbon accumulation depends on the alkane being dehydrogenated. For ethane, carbon accumulates primarily on the support, while for propane, some carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles.

The study does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. However, these observations suggest that hydrogen cofeeding may influence coke formation and migration patterns, which in turn affect catalyst stability and activity. The impact appears to be different for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, indicating that the specific alkane being processed is an important factor to consider.

More research would be needed to fully understand hydrogen's impacts on these aspects and overall process efficiency in PDH, particularly regarding its effects on energy barriers, acid site conversions, and the graphitization process.

          文献没有直接提供关于氢气共进料如何具体影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的信息。然而，可以得出一些相关观察：

1. 在乙烷和丙烷脱氢实验中都使用了氢气共进料，占进料组成的25%。

2. 尽管进料中存在氢气，但在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中仍然发生积碳。这表明仅靠氢气共进料可能不足以完全防止积碳形成。

3. 将Pt与In合金化显著减少了两种反应的积碳沉积，说明催化剂组成在减少积碳方面起着关键作用。

4. 虽然两种反应沉积的积碳量相当，但对催化剂活性的影响不同。积碳对乙烷脱氢活性影响很小，但导致丙烷脱氢活性下降。

5. 这种差异归因于积碳迁移模式的不同 - 乙烷脱氢过程中产生的积碳比丙烷脱氢产生的积碳更容易从PtIn纳米颗粒迁移到载体上。

6. 碳积累的位置取决于被脱氢的烷烃。对于乙烷，碳主要积累在载体上，而对于丙烷，一些碳也积累在PtIn纳米颗粒上。

该研究没有直接讨论氢气共进料对能垒、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响。然而，这些观察结果表明，氢气共进料可能会影响积碳形成和迁移模式，从而影响催化剂的稳定性和活性。对乙烷和丙烷脱氢的影响似乎不同，表明所处理的特定烷烃是需要考虑的重要因素。

需要进行更多研究才能充分理解氢气对PDH这些方面及整体过程效率的影响，特别是关于其对能垒、酸性位转化和石墨化过程的影响。
