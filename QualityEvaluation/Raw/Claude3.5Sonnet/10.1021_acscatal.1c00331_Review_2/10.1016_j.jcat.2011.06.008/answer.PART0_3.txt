[1] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[3] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[4] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not specifically address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does discuss coke formation and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation without hydrogen cofeeding. 

The study shows that alloying Pt with In significantly reduces coke deposition during propane dehydrogenation. The optimal catalyst composition (In/Pt ratio of 0.48) achieves maximum activity and nearly 100% selectivity to propene. 

Coke accumulation affects propane dehydrogenation more severely than ethane dehydrogenation, causing a loss in catalyst activity over time. This difference is attributed to the coke precursors formed during propane dehydrogenation being less mobile and more likely to remain on the PtIn nanoparticles rather than migrating to the support.

While the study does not directly examine hydrogen cofeeding, these findings suggest that strategies to enhance coke mobility or reduce its formation on active sites could improve catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation. Hydrogen cofeeding could potentially play such a role by affecting reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, or coke precursor formation, but further research would be needed to confirm its specific impacts in this catalyst system.

这篇文献没有具体讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢的影响。但是,它确实讨论了没有氢气共进料情况下丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳形成和催化剂稳定性。

研究表明,将Pt与In合金化显著降低了丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳沉积。最佳催化剂组成(In/Pt比为0.48)达到最大活性,丙烯选择性接近100%。

与乙烷脱氢相比,积碳累积对丙烷脱氢的影响更为严重,导致催化剂活性随时间降低。这种差异归因于丙烷脱氢过程中形成的积碳前体物移动性较差,更可能留在PtIn纳米粒子上,而不是迁移到载体上。

虽然该研究没有直接考察氢气共进料的影响,但这些发现表明,增强积碳移动性或减少其在活性位点上形成的策略可能会提高丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂的稳定性。氢气共进料可能通过影响反应机理、能量障碍或积碳前体物的形成来发挥这样的作用,但需要进一步的研究来确认它在这个催化剂系统中的具体影响。
