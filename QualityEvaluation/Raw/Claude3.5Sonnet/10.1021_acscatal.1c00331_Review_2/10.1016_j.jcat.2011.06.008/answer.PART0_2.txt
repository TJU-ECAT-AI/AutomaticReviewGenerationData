[1] "The amount of coke deposited was determined by combustion of the deposited material. Prior to combustion, the catalyst (0.025 g) was purged with flowing He (60 cm3/min) at 873 K for 5 min, and then exposed it to a mixture of 5% O2 in He flowing at 60 cm3/min."

[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[3] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[4] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "Measurements of catalyst activity and selectivity were carried out at 873 K, using 0.025 g of catalyst and a feed consisting of 20% ethane or propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance He flowing at 60 cm3/min"

The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant information can be inferred:

1. Hydrogen was cofed during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation experiments, making up 25% of the feed.

2. Coke deposition occurred during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, despite the presence of hydrogen in the feed.

3. Alloying Pt with In significantly reduced coke deposition for both reactions.

4. The amount of coke deposited was similar for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, but the effects on catalyst activity differed. Coke had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity.

5. This difference was attributed to the easier migration of coke from PtIn nanoparticles to the support during ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

While the literature does not provide specific information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alone may not be sufficient to prevent coke formation entirely. The alloying of Pt with In appears to have a more significant impact on reducing coke deposition. The study does not directly address the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on overall process efficiency and performance in PDH.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。但是可以推断出一些相关信息：

1. 在乙烷和丙烷脱氢实验中都使用了氢气共进料，占进料的25%。

2. 尽管进料中存在氢气，但在乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中仍然发生积碳。

3. 将Pt与In合金化显著减少了两种反应的积碳沉积。

4. 乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中沉积的积碳量相似，但对催化剂活性的影响不同。积碳对乙烷脱氢活性没有影响，但导致丙烷脱氢活性下降。

5. 这种差异被归因于在乙烷脱氢过程中，积碳从PtIn纳米颗粒迁移到载体上比丙烷脱氢过程更容易。

虽然文献没有提供氢气共进料如何影响能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体信息，但它表明仅靠氢气共进料可能不足以完全防止积碳形成。Pt与In的合金化似乎对减少积碳沉积有更显著的影响。该研究没有直接讨论氢气共进料对PDH整体过程效率和性能的影响。
