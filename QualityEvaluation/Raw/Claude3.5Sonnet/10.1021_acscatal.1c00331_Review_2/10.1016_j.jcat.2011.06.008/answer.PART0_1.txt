[1] "20% ethane or propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance He flowing at 60 cm3/min"

[2] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[3] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[4] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made:

1. Hydrogen was cofed during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation experiments, at 25% of the feed composition.

2. Alloying Pt with In significantly reduced coke deposition for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

3. While comparable amounts of coke were deposited for both reactions, the impact on catalyst activity differed. Coke had little effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity but caused activity loss for propane dehydrogenation.

4. This difference was attributed to coke migration patterns - coke produced during ethane dehydrogenation migrated more easily from PtIn nanoparticles to the support compared to coke from propane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not discuss specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about hydrogen's impacts on these aspects and overall process efficiency in PDH.

该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何具体影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的详细信息。但是可以得出一些相关观察:

1. 在乙烷和丙烷脱氢实验中都使用了氢气共进料,占进料组成的25%。

2. 将铂与铟合金化显著减少了乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中的积碳沉积。

3. 虽然两种反应沉积的积碳量相当,但对催化剂活性的影响不同。积碳对乙烷脱氢活性影响很小,但导致丙烷脱氢活性下降。

4. 这种差异归因于积碳迁移模式的不同 - 乙烷脱氢过程中产生的积碳比丙烷脱氢产生的积碳更容易从PtIn纳米颗粒迁移到载体上。

该文献没有讨论氢气共进料对能垒、酸性位转化或石墨化的具体影响。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答有关氢气对PDH这些方面及整体过程效率影响的问题。
