The literature provides limited direct information about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. However, some insights can be inferred from the data presented:

1. Reaction counts: Table S3 and Figure S4 show the count of reactions at different hydrogen pressures (0 and 1 kPa). This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding does influence the reaction mechanisms, as the frequency of various reactions changes with hydrogen pressure.

2. Hydrogen adsorption: The last row of Table S3 shows a dramatic increase in hydrogen dissociative adsorption when hydrogen is cofed (from 5,579 to 67,900,212 counts). This indicates that hydrogen cofeeding significantly increases the surface coverage of hydrogen atoms.

3. Surface coverage: Figure S3 shows the coverage of adsorption species over time, which could potentially include information about coke precursors or intermediates. However, without more detailed information, it's difficult to draw specific conclusions about coke formation.

4. Reaction network: The data suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alters the reaction network, which could potentially affect coke formation pathways and catalyst stability. However, the exact nature of these effects cannot be determined from the given information.

5. Process efficiency: The changes in reaction counts and surface coverage with hydrogen cofeeding imply that it does impact the overall process efficiency and performance. However, without more specific data on selectivity, conversion, and yield, it's not possible to quantify these effects.

In conclusion, while the literature provides evidence that hydrogen cofeeding affects the reaction system in PDH, there is insufficient information to draw detailed conclusions about its impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and overall process efficiency. Further studies focusing specifically on these aspects would be needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH.

文献提供了有关氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的有限直接信息。然而，从所提供的数据中可以推断出一些见解：

1. 反应计数：表S3和图S4显示了在不同氢气压力下（0和1 kPa）的反应计数。这表明氢气共进料确实影响了反应机理，因为各种反应的频率随氢气压力而变化。

2. 氢气吸附：表S3的最后一行显示，当共进料氢气时，氢气解离吸附急剧增加（从5,579增加到67,900,212次）。这表明氢气共进料显著增加了表面氢原子的覆盖率。

3. 表面覆盖率：图S3显示了吸附物种随时间的覆盖率，这可能包含有关焦炭前体或中间体的信息。然而，没有更详细的信息，很难得出关于焦炭形成的具体结论。

4. 反应网络：数据表明，氢气共进料改变了反应网络，这可能影响焦炭形成途径和催化剂稳定性。然而，从给定的信息无法确定这些影响的确切性质。

5. 过程效率：反应计数和表面覆盖率随氢气共进料的变化暗示它确实影响了整体过程效率和性能。然而，没有更具体的选择性、转化率和产率数据，无法量化这些影响。

总之，虽然文献提供了证据表明氢气共进料影响了PDH的反应系统，但没有足够的信息来得出关于其对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和整体过程效率影响的详细结论。需要进一步针对这些方面的研究，以提供对PDH中氢气共进料效应的全面理解。
