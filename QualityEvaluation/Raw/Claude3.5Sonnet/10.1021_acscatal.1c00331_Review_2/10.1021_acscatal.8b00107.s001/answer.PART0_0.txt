The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, based on the available data:

1. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of hydrogen (1 kPa) significantly increases the number of hydrogen dissociative adsorption reactions compared to when no hydrogen is present (0 vs. 67,893,801 forward reactions).

2. Overall process: Hydrogen cofeeding appears to impact reaction rates, as evidenced by the changes in reaction counts between 0 and 1 kPa H2 pressure conditions shown in Table S3 and Figure S4.

3. Catalyst stability and coke formation: The document does not provide direct information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects catalyst stability or coke formation.

4. Energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization: The literature does not contain specific information on these aspects in relation to hydrogen cofeeding.

5. Process efficiency and performance: While the data suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alters reaction dynamics, there is insufficient information to determine its overall impact on process efficiency and performance.

More detailed studies would be needed to fully understand the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and other aspects of the PDH process.

文献对氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中的具体影响提供了有限的信息。但根据可用数据：

1. 反应机理：氢气的存在（1 kPa）显著增加了氢气解离吸附反应的数量，相比于没有氢气时（0对67,893,801个正向反应）。

2. 整体过程：氢气共进料似乎影响了反应速率，这从表S3和图S4中显示的0和1 kPa氢气压力条件下反应计数的变化可以看出。

3. 催化剂稳定性和积碳形成：文献没有直接提供氢气共进料如何影响催化剂稳定性或积碳形成的信息。

4. 能垒、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化和石墨化：文献中没有包含与氢气共进料相关的这些方面的具体信息。

5. 过程效率和性能：虽然数据表明氢气共进料改变了反应动力学，但没有足够的信息来确定其对过程效率和性能的整体影响。

需要进行更详细的研究才能充分理解氢气共进料对积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和PDH过程其他方面的影响。
