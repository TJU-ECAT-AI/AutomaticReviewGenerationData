The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some limited information can be inferred from the data presented:

1. The presence of hydrogen significantly affects the reaction rates and mechanisms. Table S3 and Figure S4 show the count of reactions under different hydrogen pressures (0 and 1 kPa).

2. Hydrogen cofeeding dramatically increases the rate of hydrogen dissociative adsorption. At 0 pressure, there were 5,579 hydrogen dissociative adsorption events, while at 1 kPa pressure, this number increased to 67,893,801.

3. The data suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alters the surface coverage and reaction pathways, which could potentially impact coke formation and catalyst stability. However, the document does not provide direct information on these aspects.

4. The effect on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization is not explicitly discussed in the given literature.

5. The overall process efficiency and performance implications are not directly addressed in the provided information.

To fully answer the question, more specific data on coke formation, catalyst stability, and detailed reaction mechanisms under different hydrogen pressures would be needed.

该文献没有全面回答氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的问题。然而,从所提供的数据中可以推断出一些有限的信息:

1. 氢气的存在显著影响反应速率和机理。表S3和图S4显示了在不同氢气压力(0和1 kPa)下的反应计数。

2. 氢气共进料极大地增加了氢气解离吸附的速率。在0压力下,有5,579次氢气解离吸附事件,而在1 kPa压力下,这个数字增加到了67,893,801。

3. 数据表明,氢气共进料改变了表面覆盖和反应途径,这可能会影响积碳形成和催化剂稳定性。然而,文件并未直接提供这些方面的信息。

4. 文献中没有明确讨论对能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化和石墨化的影响。

5. 所提供的信息中没有直接涉及整体过程效率和性能影响。

要完整回答这个问题,需要更多关于不同氢气压力下积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和详细反应机理的具体数据。
