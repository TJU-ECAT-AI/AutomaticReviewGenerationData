The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, based on the available data:

1. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of hydrogen (1 kPa) significantly increases the number of hydrogen dissociative adsorption reactions compared to when no hydrogen is present (0 vs. 67,893,801 forward reactions).

2. Overall process: Hydrogen cofeeding appears to impact reaction rates, as evidenced by the changes in reaction counts between 0 and 1 kPa H2 pressure conditions shown in Table S3 and Figure S4.

3. Catalyst stability and coke formation: The document does not provide direct information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects catalyst stability or coke formation.

4. Energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization: The literature does not contain specific information on these aspects in relation to hydrogen cofeeding.

5. Process efficiency and performance: While the data suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alters reaction dynamics, there is insufficient information to determine its overall impact on process efficiency and performance.

More detailed studies would be needed to fully understand the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and other aspects of the PDH process.

1. 反应机理：氢气的存在（1 kPa）显著增加了氢气解离吸附反应的数量，相比于没有氢气时（0对67,893,801个正向反应）。

2. 整体过程：氢气共进料似乎影响了反应速率，这从表S3和图S4中显示的0和1 kPa氢气压力条件下反应计数的变化可以看出。

3. 催化剂稳定性和积碳形成：文献没有直接提供氢气共进料如何影响催化剂稳定性或积碳形成的信息。

4. 能垒、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化和石墨化：文献中没有包含与氢气共进料相关的这些方面的具体信息。

5. 过程效率和性能：虽然数据表明氢气共进料改变了反应动力学，但没有足够的信息来确定其对过程效率和性能的整体影响。

需要进行更详细的研究才能充分理解氢气共进料对积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和PDH过程其他方面的影响。

The literature provides limited direct information about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. However, some insights can be inferred from the data presented:

1. Reaction counts: Table S3 and Figure S4 show the count of reactions at different hydrogen pressures (0 and 1 kPa). This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding does influence the reaction mechanisms, as the frequency of various reactions changes with hydrogen pressure.

2. Hydrogen adsorption: The last row of Table S3 shows a dramatic increase in hydrogen dissociative adsorption when hydrogen is cofed (from 5,579 to 67,900,212 counts). This indicates that hydrogen cofeeding significantly increases the surface coverage of hydrogen atoms.

3. Surface coverage: Figure S3 shows the coverage of adsorption species over time, which could potentially include information about coke precursors or intermediates. However, without more detailed information, it's difficult to draw specific conclusions about coke formation.

4. Reaction network: The data suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alters the reaction network, which could potentially affect coke formation pathways and catalyst stability. However, the exact nature of these effects cannot be determined from the given information.

5. Process efficiency: The changes in reaction counts and surface coverage with hydrogen cofeeding imply that it does impact the overall process efficiency and performance. However, without more specific data on selectivity, conversion, and yield, it's not possible to quantify these effects.

In conclusion, while the literature provides evidence that hydrogen cofeeding affects the reaction system in PDH, there is insufficient information to draw detailed conclusions about its impact on coke formation, catalyst stability, and overall process efficiency. Further studies focusing specifically on these aspects would be needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in PDH.

文献提供了有关氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的有限直接信息。然而，从所提供的数据中可以推断出一些见解：

1. 反应计数：表S3和图S4显示了在不同氢气压力下（0和1 kPa）的反应计数。这表明氢气共进料确实影响了反应机理，因为各种反应的频率随氢气压力而变化。

2. 氢气吸附：表S3的最后一行显示，当共进料氢气时，氢气解离吸附急剧增加（从5,579增加到67,900,212次）。这表明氢气共进料显著增加了表面氢原子的覆盖率。

3. 表面覆盖率：图S3显示了吸附物种随时间的覆盖率，这可能包含有关焦炭前体或中间体的信息。然而，没有更详细的信息，很难得出关于焦炭形成的具体结论。

4. 反应网络：数据表明，氢气共进料改变了反应网络，这可能影响焦炭形成途径和催化剂稳定性。然而，从给定的信息无法确定这些影响的确切性质。

5. 过程效率：反应计数和表面覆盖率随氢气共进料的变化暗示它确实影响了整体过程效率和性能。然而，没有更具体的选择性、转化率和产率数据，无法量化这些影响。

总之，虽然文献提供了证据表明氢气共进料影响了PDH的反应系统，但没有足够的信息来得出关于其对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和整体过程效率影响的详细结论。需要进一步针对这些方面的研究，以提供对PDH中氢气共进料效应的全面理解。

The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, based on the available data, we can infer some impacts:

1. Reaction kinetics: The presence of hydrogen (1 kPa) significantly increases the number of hydrogen dissociative adsorption reactions compared to when no hydrogen is present. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alters the surface coverage and reaction pathways.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The addition of hydrogen appears to affect the rates of various reactions in the PDH process, as evidenced by the different reaction counts under 0 and 1 kPa H2 pressures. This implies that hydrogen cofeeding influences the reaction network and potentially the dominant pathways.

3. Coke formation: While not directly addressed, the changes in reaction rates and surface coverage due to hydrogen cofeeding may impact coke formation processes. However, the extent and nature of this impact cannot be determined from the given information.

4. Catalyst stability: The presence of hydrogen likely affects the balance of surface species and reactions, which could influence catalyst stability. However, specific details on this effect are not provided in the literature.

5. Process efficiency: The significant increase in hydrogen dissociative adsorption with hydrogen cofeeding suggests a change in the overall process dynamics, which may impact efficiency. However, without more detailed information on selectivity and conversion, it's difficult to determine the overall effect on process performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in relation to hydrogen cofeeding. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully understand these aspects and their implications for PDH process optimization.

2. 反应机理：氢气的添加似乎影响了PDH过程中各种反应的速率，这从0和1 kPa氢气压力下不同的反应计数可以看出。这意味着氢气共进料影响了反应网络和潜在的主导途径。

3. 积碳形成：虽然没有直接提及，但由于氢气共进料导致的反应速率和表面覆盖率的变化可能会影响积碳形成过程。然而，从给定的信息中无法确定这种影响的程度和性质。

4. 催化剂稳定性：氢气的存在可能会影响表面物种和反应的平衡，这可能会影响催化剂的稳定性。然而，文献中没有提供关于这种影响的具体细节。

5. 过程效率：氢气共进料时氢气解离吸附显著增加，表明整体过程动力学发生了变化，这可能会影响效率。然而，由于缺乏关于选择性和转化率的更详细信息，很难确定对过程性能的整体影响。

文献没有提供关于氢气共进料对能量壁垒、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体信息。需要更全面的研究来充分理解这些方面及其对PDH过程优化的影响。

The literature provides some information on the effects of hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, but it does not directly address all aspects of the question. Based on the available data:

1. Hydrogen cofeeding significantly increases the rate of hydrogen dissociative adsorption. When no hydrogen is present (p(H2)=0), there are 5,579 hydrogen dissociative adsorption events. With hydrogen cofeeding (p(H2)=1kPa), this number increases dramatically to 67,893,801 events.

2. The presence of hydrogen affects the rates of various reactions in the PDH process, as shown in Table S3 and Figure S4. Most reactions show increased rates (both forward and backward) when hydrogen is cofed.

3. The data does not directly address coke formation, catalyst stability, or graphitization. However, the increased hydrogen presence on the catalyst surface (due to higher dissociative adsorption) may influence these factors.

4. The literature does not provide information on energy barriers or acid site conversions in relation to hydrogen cofeeding.

5. The overall process efficiency and performance implications are not explicitly discussed in the given literature.

To fully answer the question, more detailed information would be needed on coke formation patterns, catalyst stability measurements, and specific reaction mechanism changes under different hydrogen pressures.
