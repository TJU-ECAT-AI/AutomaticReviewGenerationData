The literature provides limited information on the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, based on the available data, we can infer some impacts:

1. Reaction kinetics: The presence of hydrogen (1 kPa) significantly increases the number of hydrogen dissociative adsorption reactions compared to when no hydrogen is present. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alters the surface coverage and reaction pathways.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The addition of hydrogen appears to affect the rates of various reactions in the PDH process, as evidenced by the different reaction counts under 0 and 1 kPa H2 pressures. This implies that hydrogen cofeeding influences the reaction network and potentially the dominant pathways.

3. Coke formation: While not directly addressed, the changes in reaction rates and surface coverage due to hydrogen cofeeding may impact coke formation processes. However, the extent and nature of this impact cannot be determined from the given information.

4. Catalyst stability: The presence of hydrogen likely affects the balance of surface species and reactions, which could influence catalyst stability. However, specific details on this effect are not provided in the literature.

5. Process efficiency: The significant increase in hydrogen dissociative adsorption with hydrogen cofeeding suggests a change in the overall process dynamics, which may impact efficiency. However, without more detailed information on selectivity and conversion, it's difficult to determine the overall effect on process performance.

The literature does not provide specific information on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in relation to hydrogen cofeeding. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully understand these aspects and their implications for PDH process optimization.

文献对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中氢气共进料的具体影响提供了有限的信息。但是，根据可用数据，我们可以推断出一些影响：

1. 反应动力学：存在氢气（1 kPa）时，氢气解离吸附反应的数量显著增加，相比于没有氢气存在时。这表明氢气共进料改变了表面覆盖率和反应途径。

2. 反应机理：氢气的添加似乎影响了PDH过程中各种反应的速率，这从0和1 kPa氢气压力下不同的反应计数可以看出。这意味着氢气共进料影响了反应网络和潜在的主导途径。

3. 积碳形成：虽然没有直接提及，但由于氢气共进料导致的反应速率和表面覆盖率的变化可能会影响积碳形成过程。然而，从给定的信息中无法确定这种影响的程度和性质。

4. 催化剂稳定性：氢气的存在可能会影响表面物种和反应的平衡，这可能会影响催化剂的稳定性。然而，文献中没有提供关于这种影响的具体细节。

5. 过程效率：氢气共进料时氢气解离吸附显著增加，表明整体过程动力学发生了变化，这可能会影响效率。然而，由于缺乏关于选择性和转化率的更详细信息，很难确定对过程性能的整体影响。

文献没有提供关于氢气共进料对能量壁垒、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化或石墨化的具体信息。需要更全面的研究来充分理解这些方面及其对PDH过程优化的影响。
