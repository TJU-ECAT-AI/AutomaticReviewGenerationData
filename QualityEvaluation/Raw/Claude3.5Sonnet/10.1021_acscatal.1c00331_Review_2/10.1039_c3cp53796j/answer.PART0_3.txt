[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "This effort is motivated by recent experimental work of our group, which show a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3 : 2 in the gas feed."

[4] "Surprisingly, only four phases are to be expected in the given range, with a notably sharp transition from a single-atom coverage to an almost complete saturation of the tetrahedral model system."

[5] "We find that the presence of one or two hydrogen atoms on the cluster has little effect on the adsorption of alkanes, but raises the Gibbs free energies of the transition states for the three CH cleavages. Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Coke formation reduction: The presence of hydrogen helps reduce the rate of coke formation on the catalyst surface. This is one of the main advantages of hydrogen cofeeding.

2. Alkene desorption: Adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitate alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This effect helps prevent the formation of coke precursors.

3. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster raises the Gibbs free energies of transition states for CH cleavages. Notably, it increases the energy barrier for the third (undesired) cleavage step to a greater extent than for the first two steps. This selective increase in energy barriers helps improve the selectivity towards alkene formation.

4. Catalyst coverage: The study shows a sharp transition from single-atom hydrogen coverage to almost complete saturation of the catalyst model system. This suggests that hydrogen coverage on the catalyst surface is not linear with increasing hydrogen partial pressure.

5. Optimal hydrogen ratio: Experimental work shows a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3:2 in the gas feed. This indicates that there is an optimal amount of hydrogen cofeeding for maximizing process efficiency.

6. Reaction mechanism: The presence of hydrogen has little effect on the adsorption of alkanes but significantly impacts the subsequent dehydrogenation steps. This suggests that hydrogen primarily influences the reaction mechanism after the initial adsorption of the alkane.

These effects collectively contribute to improved process efficiency and performance by enhancing alkene selectivity, reducing coke formation, and maintaining catalyst stability. However, the optimal amount of hydrogen cofeeding needs to be carefully controlled to balance these benefits against potential drawbacks such as increased energy barriers for initial dehydrogenation steps.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个影响：

1. 减少焦炭形成：氢气的存在有助于减少催化剂表面焦炭的形成速率。这是氢气共进料的主要优势之一。

2. 烯烃脱附：催化剂簇上吸附的氢原子促进烯烃脱附，相对于吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢。这种效应有助于防止焦炭前体的形成。

3. 能量障碍：催化剂簇上氢原子的存在提高了CH键断裂过渡态的吉布斯自由能。值得注意的是，它增加了第三步（不期望的）断裂步骤的能量障碍，程度大于前两个步骤。这种选择性的能量障碍增加有助于提高烯烃形成的选择性。

4. 催化剂覆盖：研究显示，从单原子氢覆盖到催化剂模型系统几乎完全饱和有一个急剧的转变。这表明催化剂表面的氢覆盖率与氢分压的增加并非线性关系。

5. 最佳氢气比例：实验工作显示，在气体进料中氢气与乙烷比例为3:2时，乙烯形成速率最大。这表明存在一个最佳的氢气共进料量以最大化过程效率。

6. 反应机理：氢气的存在对烷烃的吸附影响很小，但显著影响随后的脱氢步骤。这表明氢气主要影响烷烃初始吸附后的反应机理。

这些效应共同促进了过程效率和性能的提高，通过增强烯烃选择性、减少焦炭形成和维持催化剂稳定性。然而，需要仔细控制氢气共进料的最佳量，以平衡这些益处和潜在的缺点，如增加初始脱氢步骤的能量障碍。
