[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "This effort is motivated by recent experimental work of our group, which show a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3 : 2 in the gas feed."

[4] "At higher temperature the desorption of the alkenes becomes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, which explains the desired and experimentally observed high selectivity towards alkene formation."

[5] "Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps. A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several beneficial effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Reduced coke formation: The presence of hydrogen helps reduce the rate of coke formation on the catalyst surface. This is one of the main advantages of hydrogen cofeeding.

2. Improved selectivity: Adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitate alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This improves the selectivity towards desired alkene products and reduces the formation of coke precursors.

3. Optimized reaction conditions: Experimental work shows a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3:2 in the gas feed, indicating an optimal balance between hydrogen's beneficial effects and potential inhibition of the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Altered energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding raises the energy barrier for the third (undesired) C-H cleavage step to a greater extent than for the first two steps. This further promotes alkene formation over continued dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.

5. Temperature effects: At higher temperatures, alkene desorption becomes more favorable than the third C-H cleavage step, which enhances selectivity towards alkene formation. Hydrogen cofeeding can work synergistically with temperature effects to improve overall selectivity.

6. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain catalyst stability over longer periods, potentially extending catalyst lifetime and reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles.

These effects contribute to improved overall process efficiency and performance in PDH by enhancing selectivity, reducing unwanted side reactions, and maintaining catalyst activity for longer periods. However, the optimal amount of hydrogen cofeeding needs to be carefully controlled to balance these benefits against potential inhibition of the main dehydrogenation reaction.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个有益影响：

1. 减少焦炭形成：氢气的存在有助于减少催化剂表面焦炭的形成速率。这是氢气共进料的主要优势之一。

2. 提高选择性：吸附在催化剂簇上的氢原子促进烯烃脱附，而不是吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢。这提高了对所需烯烃产物的选择性，减少了焦炭前体的形成。

3. 优化反应条件：实验工作表明，在气体进料中氢气与乙烷比例为3:2时，乙烯形成速率最大，表明在氢气的有益效果和对脱氢反应的潜在抑制之间达到了最佳平衡。

4. 改变能量障碍：氢气共进料提高了第三次（不期望的）C-H键断裂步骤的能量障碍，程度大于前两次步骤。这进一步促进了烯烃的形成，而不是继续脱氢导致焦炭前体的形成。

5. 温度效应：在较高温度下，烯烃脱附比第三次C-H键断裂更有利，这提高了烯烃形成的选择性。氢气共进料可以与温度效应协同作用，提高整体选择性。

6. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少焦炭形成，氢气共进料有助于在更长时间内保持催化剂稳定性，可能延长催化剂寿命并减少再生周期的频率。

这些效果通过提高选择性、减少不希望的副反应以及长期维持催化剂活性，有助于提高PDH过程的整体效率和性能。然而，需要仔细控制氢气共进料的最佳量，以平衡这些优势与对主要脱氢反应的潜在抑制。

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects several aspects of the reaction:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding reduces the rate of coke formation, improving catalyst stability.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface facilitates alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This change in mechanism helps prevent the formation of coke precursors.

3. Energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding raises the Gibbs free energies of transition states for CH cleavages, particularly for the third (undesired) cleavage step. This selective increase in energy barriers improves the selectivity towards alkene formation.

4. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst stability, potentially extending the catalyst's lifetime and reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles.

5. Process efficiency: The addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas can improve the selectivity of the reaction towards alkene formation, potentially increasing the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

6. Performance: While hydrogen cofeeding slightly reduces catalyst activity by raising energy barriers for all CH cleavages, it significantly improves selectivity towards desired products (alkenes) and reduces undesired side reactions leading to coke formation.

These effects collectively suggest that hydrogen cofeeding can enhance the PDH process by improving selectivity, reducing coke formation, and increasing catalyst stability, despite a minor decrease in overall activity. The optimal hydrogen cofeed ratio would need to be determined experimentally to balance these factors for maximum process performance.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中影响反应的几个方面：

1. 积碳形成：氢气共进料减少了积碳形成的速率，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

2. 反应机理：催化剂表面吸附的氢原子促进烯烃脱附，而不是吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢。这种机理的变化有助于防止积碳前体的形成。

3. 能量障碍：氢气共进料提高了CH键断裂的过渡态吉布斯自由能，尤其是第三步（不期望的）断裂步骤。这种能量障碍的选择性增加提高了烯烃形成的选择性。

4. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料增强了催化剂的稳定性，可能延长催化剂的寿命并减少再生周期的频率。

5. 过程效率：添加少量氢气可以提高反应向烯烃形成的选择性，可能会增加PDH过程的整体效率。

6. 性能：虽然氢气共进料略微降低了催化剂活性（通过提高所有CH键断裂的能量障碍），但它显著提高了对目标产物（烯烃）的选择性，并减少了导致积碳形成的不期望副反应。

这些效果共同表明，氢气共进料可以通过提高选择性、减少积碳形成和增加催化剂稳定性来增强PDH过程，尽管整体活性略有下降。需要通过实验确定最佳的氢气共进料比例，以平衡这些因素，实现最佳的过程性能。

[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "Even at very low residence times, where the re-adsorption of alkenes is minimized, co-feeding hydrogen gas promotes the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "The barrier for the rate-determining step A2 is reduced by about 2 kcal mol1 on average, suggesting that Sn addition may enhance the rate of alkane dehydrogenation. This beneficial effect comes at the cost of a reduced selectivity since the introduction of Sn also lowers the barrier for the undesired third CH cleavage."

[5] "The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be simulated with the Pt4 model. The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."

[6] "This phase shows an improved selectivity towards alkene production: the third CH cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, making it even less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption. This comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity as the presence of hydrogen shifts all transition states to some extent, including the rate-determining first CH cleavage step."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Reduced coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding is known to reduce the rate of coke formation, which is a major factor in improving catalyst stability.

2. Improved alkene desorption: The presence of adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface facilitates alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This helps prevent the formation of coke precursors.

3. Enhanced catalyst activity: Even at low residence times, cofeeding hydrogen gas promotes catalyst activity. This suggests a beneficial electronic effect related to partial hydrogen coverage of the catalyst.

4. Altered energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding shifts the energy barriers of the reaction steps. While it slightly increases the barrier for the rate-determining first C-H cleavage step, it significantly increases the barrier for the third C-H cleavage step. This results in improved selectivity towards alkene production.

5. Stable catalyst structure: The Pt4 model used in the study remains stable upon hydrogen adsorption, allowing for the investigation of adsorbed hydrogen's influence on the reaction pathway without geometry-induced effects.

6. Trade-off between selectivity and activity: While hydrogen cofeeding improves selectivity towards alkene production by making the third C-H cleavage less competitive with alkene desorption, it slightly reduces overall activity due to the increased energy barriers for all transition states.

These effects have important implications for the PDH process:

1. Improved catalyst longevity: Reduced coke formation leads to extended catalyst life and fewer regeneration cycles.

2. Enhanced process efficiency: Better selectivity towards desired alkene products improves overall process efficiency.

3. Optimized operating conditions: The trade-off between selectivity and activity suggests the need for careful optimization of hydrogen cofeed rates to balance these factors.

4. Potential for process intensification: The ability to reduce coke formation while maintaining or improving activity may allow for more aggressive operating conditions, potentially increasing overall process throughput.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding appears to be a valuable strategy for improving the PDH process, offering benefits in terms of catalyst stability, selectivity, and potentially overall process performance, despite a slight reduction in catalytic activity.

1. 减少焦炭形成：氢气共进料已知可以降低焦炭形成速率，这是提高催化剂稳定性的一个主要因素。

2. 改善烯烃脱附：催化剂表面吸附的氢原子有助于烯烃脱附，相对于吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢更容易发生。这有助于防止焦炭前体的形成。

3. 提高催化剂活性：即使在低停留时间下，共进料氢气也能促进催化剂活性。这表明催化剂部分氢覆盖有相关的有益电子效应。

4. 改变能量障碍：氢气共进料改变了反应步骤的能量障碍。虽然它略微增加了限速步骤（第一个C-H键断裂）的障碍，但显著增加了第三个C-H键断裂步骤的障碍。这导致了烯烃生产选择性的提高。

5. 稳定的催化剂结构：研究中使用的Pt4模型在氢吸附时保持稳定，允许研究吸附氢对反应途径的影响，而不受几何诱导效应的影响。

6. 选择性和活性的权衡：虽然氢气共进料通过使第三个C-H键断裂与烯烃脱附相比竞争力降低，从而提高了烯烃生产的选择性，但由于所有过渡态的能量障碍增加，略微降低了整体活性。

这些影响对PDH过程有重要意义：

1. 提高催化剂寿命：焦炭形成减少导致催化剂寿命延长，再生周期减少。

2. 提高过程效率：对目标烯烃产品的选择性提高改善了整体过程效率。

3. 优化操作条件：选择性和活性之间的权衡表明需要仔细优化氢气共进料速率以平衡这些因素。

4. 过程强化的潜力：在保持或提高活性的同时减少焦炭形成的能力可能允许更激进的操作条件，潜在地增加整体过程产量。

总的来说，氢气共进料似乎是改善PDH过程的一种有价值的策略，尽管催化活性略有降低，但在催化剂稳定性、选择性和潜在的整体过程性能方面提供了好处。

This selective increase in energy barriers helps improve the selectivity towards alkene formation.

4. Catalyst coverage: The study shows a sharp transition from single-atom hydrogen coverage to almost complete saturation of the catalyst model system. This suggests that hydrogen coverage on the catalyst surface is not linear with increasing hydrogen partial pressure.

5. Optimal hydrogen ratio: Experimental work shows a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3:2 in the gas feed. This indicates that there is an optimal amount of hydrogen cofeeding for maximizing process efficiency.

6. Reaction mechanism: The presence of hydrogen has little effect on the adsorption of alkanes but significantly impacts the subsequent dehydrogenation steps. This suggests that hydrogen primarily influences the reaction mechanism after the initial adsorption of the alkane.

These effects collectively contribute to improved process efficiency and performance by enhancing alkene selectivity, reducing coke formation, and maintaining catalyst stability. However, the optimal amount of hydrogen cofeeding needs to be carefully controlled to balance these benefits against potential drawbacks such as increased energy barriers for initial dehydrogenation steps.

1. Reduced coke formation: The presence of hydrogen helps reduce the rate of coke formation on the catalyst surface. This is one of the main advantages of hydrogen cofeeding.

2. Improved selectivity: Hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst surface raises the energy barrier for the third C-H cleavage step more significantly than for the first two steps. This improves the selectivity towards alkene formation by making further dehydrogenation less favorable.

3. Facilitated alkene desorption: Adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitate alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. This helps prevent over-dehydrogenation and coke formation.

4. Minimal impact on initial reaction steps: The presence of hydrogen has only a marginal effect on the first two C-H cleavage steps, meaning it does not significantly hinder the main dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Catalyst surface coverage: The study found that under typical PDH conditions, only a single hydrogen atom coverage on the catalyst cluster is likely, avoiding complete saturation of active sites.

These effects collectively contribute to improved catalyst stability by reducing coke formation, enhanced selectivity towards the desired alkene products, and maintained catalytic activity. The overall result is improved process efficiency and performance in propane dehydrogenation.
