[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "Our results show that in all cases the rate-determining step is cleavage of a CH bond upon alkane adsorption."

[4] "The presence of one or two hydrogen atoms on the cluster has little effect on the adsorption of alkanes, but raises the Gibbs free energies of the transition states for the three CH cleavages. Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps."

[5] "A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects several aspects of the reaction:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding reduces the rate of coke formation, improving catalyst stability.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface facilitates alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This change in mechanism helps prevent the formation of coke precursors.

3. Energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding raises the Gibbs free energies of transition states for CH cleavages, particularly for the third (undesired) cleavage step. This selective increase in energy barriers improves the selectivity towards alkene formation.

4. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst stability, potentially extending the catalyst's lifetime and reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles.

5. Process efficiency: The addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas can improve the selectivity of the reaction towards alkene formation, potentially increasing the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

6. Performance: While hydrogen cofeeding slightly reduces catalyst activity by raising energy barriers for all CH cleavages, it significantly improves selectivity towards desired products (alkenes) and reduces undesired side reactions leading to coke formation.

These effects collectively suggest that hydrogen cofeeding can enhance the PDH process by improving selectivity, reducing coke formation, and increasing catalyst stability, despite a minor decrease in overall activity. The optimal hydrogen cofeed ratio would need to be determined experimentally to balance these factors for maximum process performance.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中影响反应的几个方面：

1. 积碳形成：氢气共进料减少了积碳形成的速率，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

2. 反应机理：催化剂表面吸附的氢原子促进烯烃脱附，而不是吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢。这种机理的变化有助于防止积碳前体的形成。

3. 能量障碍：氢气共进料提高了CH键断裂的过渡态吉布斯自由能，尤其是第三步（不期望的）断裂步骤。这种能量障碍的选择性增加提高了烯烃形成的选择性。

4. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料增强了催化剂的稳定性，可能延长催化剂的寿命并减少再生周期的频率。

5. 过程效率：添加少量氢气可以提高反应向烯烃形成的选择性，可能会增加PDH过程的整体效率。

6. 性能：虽然氢气共进料略微降低了催化剂活性（通过提高所有CH键断裂的能量障碍），但它显著提高了对目标产物（烯烃）的选择性，并减少了导致积碳形成的不期望副反应。

这些效果共同表明，氢气共进料可以通过提高选择性、减少积碳形成和增加催化剂稳定性来增强PDH过程，尽管整体活性略有下降。需要通过实验确定最佳的氢气共进料比例，以平衡这些因素，实现最佳的过程性能。
