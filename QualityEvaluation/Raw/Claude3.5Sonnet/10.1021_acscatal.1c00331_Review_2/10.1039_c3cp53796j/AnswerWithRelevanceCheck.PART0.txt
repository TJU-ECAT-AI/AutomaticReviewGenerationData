          [1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "This effort is motivated by recent experimental work of our group, which show a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3 : 2 in the gas feed."

[4] "At higher temperature the desorption of the alkenes becomes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, which explains the desired and experimentally observed high selectivity towards alkene formation."

[5] "Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps. A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

[6] "Even at very low residence times, where the re-adsorption of alkenes is minimized, co-feeding hydrogen gas promotes the activity of the catalyst."

[7] "The barrier for the rate-determining step A2 is reduced by about 2 kcal mol1 on average, suggesting that Sn addition may enhance the rate of alkane dehydrogenation. This beneficial effect comes at the cost of a reduced selectivity since the introduction of Sn also lowers the barrier for the undesired third CH cleavage."

[8] "The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be simulated with the Pt4 model. The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."

[9] "Surprisingly, only four phases are to be expected in the given range, with a notably sharp transition from a single-atom coverage to an almost complete saturation of the tetrahedral model system."

          Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in several ways:

1. Coke formation reduction: Hydrogen cofeeding reduces the rate of coke formation on the catalyst surface, which is a major advantage for maintaining catalyst stability and activity.

2. Improved selectivity: The presence of adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface raises the energy barrier for the third (undesired) C-H cleavage step more significantly than for the first two steps. This enhances selectivity towards alkene formation by making further dehydrogenation less favorable.

3. Facilitated alkene desorption: Adsorbed hydrogen atoms promote alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes, helping to prevent over-dehydrogenation and coke precursor formation.

4. Altered energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding raises the Gibbs free energies of transition states for C-H cleavages, with a more pronounced effect on the third cleavage step. This selective increase in energy barriers improves alkene selectivity.

5. Catalyst activity promotion: Even at low residence times, hydrogen cofeeding promotes catalyst activity, suggesting a beneficial electronic effect related to partial hydrogen coverage.

6. Optimal hydrogen ratio: Experimental work shows a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3:2 in the gas feed, indicating an optimal balance between hydrogen's beneficial effects and potential inhibition of the dehydrogenation reaction.

7. Catalyst surface coverage: The study reveals a sharp transition from single-atom hydrogen coverage to almost complete saturation of the catalyst model system, suggesting non-linear hydrogen coverage with increasing partial pressure.

8. Temperature effects: At higher temperatures, alkene desorption becomes more favorable than the third C-H cleavage step, working synergistically with hydrogen cofeeding to enhance selectivity towards alkene formation.

9. Trade-off between selectivity and activity: While hydrogen cofeeding improves selectivity, it may slightly reduce overall activity due to increased energy barriers for all transition states.

These effects collectively contribute to improved process efficiency and performance in PDH by enhancing selectivity, reducing unwanted side reactions, and maintaining catalyst activity for longer periods. However, the optimal amount of hydrogen cofeeding needs to be carefully controlled to balance these benefits against potential inhibition of the main dehydrogenation reaction.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中，氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个方面的影响：

1. 减少焦炭形成：氢气共进料降低了催化剂表面焦炭的形成速率，这是维持催化剂稳定性和活性的一个主要优势。

2. 提高选择性：催化剂表面吸附的氢原子提高了第三次（不期望的）C-H键断裂步骤的能量障碍，程度远大于前两个步骤。这通过使进一步脱氢变得不利来提高烯烃形成的选择性。

3. 促进烯烃脱附：吸附的氢原子促进烯烃脱附，相对于吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢更容易发生，有助于防止过度脱氢和焦炭前体的形成。

4. 改变能量障碍：氢气共进料提高了C-H键断裂过渡态的吉布斯自由能，对第三次断裂步骤的影响更为显著。这种选择性的能量障碍增加提高了烯烃的选择性。

5. 促进催化剂活性：即使在低停留时间下，氢气共进料也能促进催化剂活性，这表明部分氢覆盖有相关的有益电子效应。

6. 最佳氢气比例：实验工作表明，在气体进料中氢气与乙烷比例为3:2时，乙烯形成速率最大，表明在氢气的有益效果和对脱氢反应的潜在抑制之间达到了最佳平衡。

7. 催化剂表面覆盖：研究显示，从单原子氢覆盖到催化剂模型系统几乎完全饱和有一个急剧的转变，这表明氢覆盖率与分压增加并非线性关系。

8. 温度效应：在较高温度下，烯烃脱附比第三次C-H键断裂更有利，这与氢气共进料协同作用，增强了烯烃形成的选择性。

9. 选择性和活性的权衡：虽然氢气共进料提高了选择性，但由于所有过渡态的能量障碍增加，可能略微降低整体活性。

这些效应共同促进了PDH过程效率和性能的提高，通过增强选择性、减少不希望的副反应以及长期维持催化剂活性。然而，需要仔细控制氢气共进料的最佳量，以平衡这些优势与对主要脱氢反应的潜在抑制。
