[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "Even at very low residence times, where the re-adsorption of alkenes is minimized, co-feeding hydrogen gas promotes the activity of the catalyst."

[4] "The barrier for the rate-determining step A2 is reduced by about 2 kcal mol1 on average, suggesting that Sn addition may enhance the rate of alkane dehydrogenation. This beneficial effect comes at the cost of a reduced selectivity since the introduction of Sn also lowers the barrier for the undesired third CH cleavage."

[5] "The co-feeding of hydrogen, to reduce coking, can be simulated with the Pt4 model. The cluster is stable upon hydrogen adsorption, enabling investigation of the influence of adsorbed H atoms on the reaction pathway without effects induced by changes in cluster geometry."

[6] "This phase shows an improved selectivity towards alkene production: the third CH cleavage step is shifted to higher energy, making it even less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption. This comes at the cost of a slightly reduced activity as the presence of hydrogen shifts all transition states to some extent, including the rate-determining first CH cleavage step."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Reduced coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding is known to reduce the rate of coke formation, which is a major factor in improving catalyst stability.

2. Improved alkene desorption: The presence of adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface facilitates alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This helps prevent the formation of coke precursors.

3. Enhanced catalyst activity: Even at low residence times, cofeeding hydrogen gas promotes catalyst activity. This suggests a beneficial electronic effect related to partial hydrogen coverage of the catalyst.

4. Altered energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding shifts the energy barriers of the reaction steps. While it slightly increases the barrier for the rate-determining first C-H cleavage step, it significantly increases the barrier for the third C-H cleavage step. This results in improved selectivity towards alkene production.

5. Stable catalyst structure: The Pt4 model used in the study remains stable upon hydrogen adsorption, allowing for the investigation of adsorbed hydrogen's influence on the reaction pathway without geometry-induced effects.

6. Trade-off between selectivity and activity: While hydrogen cofeeding improves selectivity towards alkene production by making the third C-H cleavage less competitive with alkene desorption, it slightly reduces overall activity due to the increased energy barriers for all transition states.

These effects have important implications for the PDH process:

1. Improved catalyst longevity: Reduced coke formation leads to extended catalyst life and fewer regeneration cycles.

2. Enhanced process efficiency: Better selectivity towards desired alkene products improves overall process efficiency.

3. Optimized operating conditions: The trade-off between selectivity and activity suggests the need for careful optimization of hydrogen cofeed rates to balance these factors.

4. Potential for process intensification: The ability to reduce coke formation while maintaining or improving activity may allow for more aggressive operating conditions, potentially increasing overall process throughput.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding appears to be a valuable strategy for improving the PDH process, offering benefits in terms of catalyst stability, selectivity, and potentially overall process performance, despite a slight reduction in catalytic activity.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个影响：

1. 减少焦炭形成：氢气共进料已知可以降低焦炭形成速率，这是提高催化剂稳定性的一个主要因素。

2. 改善烯烃脱附：催化剂表面吸附的氢原子有助于烯烃脱附，相对于吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢更容易发生。这有助于防止焦炭前体的形成。

3. 提高催化剂活性：即使在低停留时间下，共进料氢气也能促进催化剂活性。这表明催化剂部分氢覆盖有相关的有益电子效应。

4. 改变能量障碍：氢气共进料改变了反应步骤的能量障碍。虽然它略微增加了限速步骤（第一个C-H键断裂）的障碍，但显著增加了第三个C-H键断裂步骤的障碍。这导致了烯烃生产选择性的提高。

5. 稳定的催化剂结构：研究中使用的Pt4模型在氢吸附时保持稳定，允许研究吸附氢对反应途径的影响，而不受几何诱导效应的影响。

6. 选择性和活性的权衡：虽然氢气共进料通过使第三个C-H键断裂与烯烃脱附相比竞争力降低，从而提高了烯烃生产的选择性，但由于所有过渡态的能量障碍增加，略微降低了整体活性。

这些影响对PDH过程有重要意义：

1. 提高催化剂寿命：焦炭形成减少导致催化剂寿命延长，再生周期减少。

2. 提高过程效率：对目标烯烃产品的选择性提高改善了整体过程效率。

3. 优化操作条件：选择性和活性之间的权衡表明需要仔细优化氢气共进料速率以平衡这些因素。

4. 过程强化的潜力：在保持或提高活性的同时减少焦炭形成的能力可能允许更激进的操作条件，潜在地增加整体过程产量。

总的来说，氢气共进料似乎是改善PDH过程的一种有价值的策略，尽管催化活性略有降低，但在催化剂稳定性、选择性和潜在的整体过程性能方面提供了好处。
