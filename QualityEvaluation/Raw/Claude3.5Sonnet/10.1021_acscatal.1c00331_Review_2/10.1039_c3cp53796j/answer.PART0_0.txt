[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "This effort is motivated by recent experimental work of our group, which show a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3 : 2 in the gas feed."

[4] "At higher temperature the desorption of the alkenes becomes more favorable than the third CH cleavage step, which explains the desired and experimentally observed high selectivity towards alkene formation."

[5] "Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps. A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several beneficial effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Reduced coke formation: The presence of hydrogen helps reduce the rate of coke formation on the catalyst surface. This is one of the main advantages of hydrogen cofeeding.

2. Improved selectivity: Adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitate alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkenes. This improves the selectivity towards desired alkene products and reduces the formation of coke precursors.

3. Optimized reaction conditions: Experimental work shows a maximum ethene formation rate at a hydrogen to ethane ratio of 3:2 in the gas feed, indicating an optimal balance between hydrogen's beneficial effects and potential inhibition of the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Altered energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding raises the energy barrier for the third (undesired) C-H cleavage step to a greater extent than for the first two steps. This further promotes alkene formation over continued dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors.

5. Temperature effects: At higher temperatures, alkene desorption becomes more favorable than the third C-H cleavage step, which enhances selectivity towards alkene formation. Hydrogen cofeeding can work synergistically with temperature effects to improve overall selectivity.

6. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding helps maintain catalyst stability over longer periods, potentially extending catalyst lifetime and reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles.

These effects contribute to improved overall process efficiency and performance in PDH by enhancing selectivity, reducing unwanted side reactions, and maintaining catalyst activity for longer periods. However, the optimal amount of hydrogen cofeeding needs to be carefully controlled to balance these benefits against potential inhibition of the main dehydrogenation reaction.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中添加氢气共进料对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有以下几个有益影响：

1. 减少焦炭形成：氢气的存在有助于减少催化剂表面焦炭的形成速率。这是氢气共进料的主要优势之一。

2. 提高选择性：吸附在催化剂簇上的氢原子促进烯烃脱附，而不是吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢。这提高了对所需烯烃产物的选择性，减少了焦炭前体的形成。

3. 优化反应条件：实验工作表明，在气体进料中氢气与乙烷比例为3:2时，乙烯形成速率最大，表明在氢气的有益效果和对脱氢反应的潜在抑制之间达到了最佳平衡。

4. 改变能量障碍：氢气共进料提高了第三次（不期望的）C-H键断裂步骤的能量障碍，程度大于前两次步骤。这进一步促进了烯烃的形成，而不是继续脱氢导致焦炭前体的形成。

5. 温度效应：在较高温度下，烯烃脱附比第三次C-H键断裂更有利，这提高了烯烃形成的选择性。氢气共进料可以与温度效应协同作用，提高整体选择性。

6. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少焦炭形成，氢气共进料有助于在更长时间内保持催化剂稳定性，可能延长催化剂寿命并减少再生周期的频率。

这些效果通过提高选择性、减少不希望的副反应以及长期维持催化剂活性，有助于提高PDH过程的整体效率和性能。然而，需要仔细控制氢气共进料的最佳量，以平衡这些优势与对主要脱氢反应的潜在抑制。
