[1] "The presence of an adsorbed H atom on the cluster facilitates alkene desorption relative to dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene."

[2] "The presence of some hydrogen is known to be advantageous, and has been mainly attributed to a reduction in the rate of coke formation."

[3] "Surprisingly, only four phases are to be expected in the given range, with a notably sharp transition from a single-atom coverage to an almost complete saturation of the tetrahedral model system."

[4] "Interestingly, it raises the energy of the third and undesired cleavage step to far greater extent than it does for the first two steps. A marginal effect on the first two CH cleavages combined with a significant shift of the third suggests that the addition of small amounts of hydrogen gas could improve the selectivity of the reaction towards the formation of alkenes."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several important effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms:

1. Reduced coke formation: The presence of hydrogen helps reduce the rate of coke formation on the catalyst surface. This is one of the main advantages of hydrogen cofeeding.

2. Improved selectivity: Hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst surface raises the energy barrier for the third C-H cleavage step more significantly than for the first two steps. This improves the selectivity towards alkene formation by making further dehydrogenation less favorable.

3. Facilitated alkene desorption: Adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst cluster facilitate alkene desorption relative to further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkene. This helps prevent over-dehydrogenation and coke formation.

4. Minimal impact on initial reaction steps: The presence of hydrogen has only a marginal effect on the first two C-H cleavage steps, meaning it does not significantly hinder the main dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Catalyst surface coverage: The study found that under typical PDH conditions, only a single hydrogen atom coverage on the catalyst cluster is likely, avoiding complete saturation of active sites.

These effects collectively contribute to improved catalyst stability by reducing coke formation, enhanced selectivity towards the desired alkene products, and maintained catalytic activity. The overall result is improved process efficiency and performance in propane dehydrogenation.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中共进料氢气对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理有几个重要影响：

1. 减少焦炭形成：氢气的存在有助于减少催化剂表面焦炭的形成速率。这是氢气共进料的主要优势之一。

2. 提高选择性：氢气在催化剂表面的吸附对第三次C-H断裂步骤的能量障碍提高比前两次更显著。这通过使进一步脱氢变得不利来提高烯烃形成的选择性。

3. 促进烯烃脱附：催化剂簇上吸附的氢原子相对于吸附烯烃的进一步脱氢来说，更容易促进烯烃脱附。这有助于防止过度脱氢和焦炭形成。

4. 对初始反应步骤影响最小：氢气的存在对前两次C-H断裂步骤只有微小影响，这意味着它不会显著阻碍主要的脱氢反应。

5. 催化剂表面覆盖：研究发现，在典型的PDH条件下，催化剂簇上可能只有单个氢原子覆盖，避免了活性位点的完全饱和。

这些效应共同促进了催化剂稳定性的提高（通过减少焦炭形成），增强了对所需烯烃产物的选择性，并保持了催化活性。总体结果是丙烷脱氢过程的效率和性能得到改善。
