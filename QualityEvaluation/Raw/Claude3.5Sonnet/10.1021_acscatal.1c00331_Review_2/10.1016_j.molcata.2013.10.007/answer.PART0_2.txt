The given literature does not contain any specific information about hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or its effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. The document focuses on comparing different supports for Pt-Sn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss hydrogen cofeeding or its impacts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
