[1] "Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."

[2] "Generally speaking, the state of Sn in bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst has obvious influence on the catalytic properties [9,23]. When this promoter exists in a metallic state (Sn0), it may be a poison; while it exists in a non-metallic state (Sn4+ or Sn2+), it acts as a promoter."

[3] "As aforementioned, the dispersion of metallic particles exhibits the different behaviors and the most uniform distribution of metallic particles can be obtained in the PtSn/MA sample."

[4] "As discussed before, this may be due to the stabilized effect to tin species by the presence of the support. In this way, the reduction of tin component becomes more difficult and the more strengthened interactions of Pt with SnOx species exist, which is favorable for the improvement of reaction stability."

</quotes>

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, based on the information provided, we can infer some relevant points:

1. Catalyst stability is influenced by the state of tin (Sn) in the bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst. Non-metallic Sn (Sn4+ or Sn2+) acts as a promoter, while metallic Sn (Sn0) can be a poison.

2. The support material plays a crucial role in stabilizing tin species and strengthening interactions between Pt and SnOx, which improves reaction stability.

3. Uniform distribution of metallic particles, as seen in the PtSn/MA (mesoporous alumina) sample, contributes to better catalyst performance.

4. The literature does not specifically mention the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization in the PDH process.

5. The overall process efficiency and performance seem to be more dependent on catalyst composition, support material, and metal-support interactions rather than hydrogen cofeeding, based on the information provided.

While the document does not directly address hydrogen cofeeding effects, it emphasizes the importance of catalyst design and support selection in improving PDH process performance and stability.

虽然文献没有直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些相关要点：

1. 催化剂的稳定性受双金属Pt-Sn催化剂中锡(Sn)状态的影响。非金属态Sn（Sn4+或Sn2+）起促进作用，而金属态Sn（Sn0）可能是毒物。

2. 载体材料在稳定锡物种和加强Pt与SnOx之间的相互作用方面起着关键作用，这有助于提高反应稳定性。

3. 金属颗粒的均匀分布，如PtSn/MA（介孔氧化铝）样品中所见，有助于提高催化剂性能。

4. 文献没有具体提到氢气共进料对PDH过程中能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响。

5. 根据所提供的信息，整体工艺效率和性能似乎更依赖于催化剂组成、载体材料和金属-载体相互作用，而非氢气共进料。

虽然文档没有直接讨论氢气共进料的影响，但它强调了催化剂设计和载体选择在改善PDH工艺性能和稳定性方面的重要性。
