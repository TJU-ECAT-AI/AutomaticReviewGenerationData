Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process or its effects on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms. The document appears to be about a density functional theory study on propane and propene adsorption on Pt(111) and PtSn alloy surfaces, but does not provide details related to the specific question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献中没有关于氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的影响，也没有涉及其对焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响。该文档似乎是关于丙烷和丙烯在Pt(111)和PtSn合金表面上吸附的密度泛函理论研究，但没有提供与所问具体问题相关的详细信息。因此，无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The document appears to be a title and partial citation for a scientific article about density functional theory studies of propane and propene adsorption on platinum and platinum-tin alloy surfaces. It does not discuss hydrogen cofeeding, coke formation, catalyst stability, or reaction mechanisms in the PDH process. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
