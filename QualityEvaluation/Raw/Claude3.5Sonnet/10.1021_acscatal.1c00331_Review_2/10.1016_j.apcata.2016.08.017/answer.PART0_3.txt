[1] "Reaction conditions: 590 C, H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio), m (cat.) = 0.3 g, WHSV = 3.0 h1."

[2] "In dehydrogenation processes, side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization) are mainly catalyzed by strong acid sites. Thus, neutralization of the strong acid sites reduces the undesirable side-reactions and improves propylene selectivity"

[3] "As shown in Fig. 1B and Table 1, propylene selectivities increased and the coke amount decreased along with the sodium ion content addition, which might be attributed to the reduction of acid sites in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is cofed with propane at a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 1/3 in the reaction conditions. 

The study focuses more on the effects of sodium ion addition to PtSn/SUZ-4 catalysts. It shows that neutralizing strong acid sites reduces side reactions like cracking, isomerization, and polymerization, which improves propylene selectivity. The addition of sodium ions decreased coke formation and increased propylene selectivity, likely due to the reduction of acid sites on the catalyst.

While the paper doesn't directly address the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, or graphitization, it does suggest that modifying the catalyst's acidity plays a crucial role in controlling coke formation and improving catalyst performance. The overall process efficiency and performance appear to be more influenced by catalyst composition and acidity rather than hydrogen cofeeding in this particular study.

这篇文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何具体影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的全面信息。但是，它确实提到在反应条件下，氢气与丙烷以1/3的摩尔比共进料。

这项研究更多地关注了向PtSn/SUZ-4催化剂中添加钠离子的影响。研究表明，中和强酸位点可以减少裂化、异构化和聚合等副反应，从而提高丙烯的选择性。添加钠离子减少了积碳形成并提高了丙烯选择性，这可能是由于催化剂上酸位点的减少。

虽然这篇文章没有直接讨论氢气共进料对能量势垒、积碳累积模式或石墨化的影响，但它确实表明调节催化剂的酸性在控制积碳形成和提高催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。在这项特定研究中，整个过程的效率和性能似乎更多地受到催化剂组成和酸性的影响，而不是氢气共进料的影响。
