[1] "Reaction conditions: 590 C, H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio), m (cat.) = 0.3 g, WHSV = 3.0 h1."

[2] "Generally, the surface area and acid sites of zeolite with regular pore structure are mainly provided by its inner surface. Pt metal particles disperse on both the outside and inner surface of zeolite."

[3] "The phenomena were caused by the neutralization of the stronger acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite, which prevented the Pt acid precursor (H2PtCl6) entering into the SUZ-4 channel."

[4] "Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites on SUZ-4 zeolite and enhanced the catalyst durability and propylene selectivity by suppressing the side reactions in propane dehydrogenation processes."

The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study focuses on the effects of sodium ion addition to PtSn/SUZ-4 catalysts rather than the role of hydrogen.

However, we can infer some general implications based on the information provided:

1. The reaction conditions mentioned include hydrogen cofeeding (H2/C3H8 = 1/3 molar ratio), suggesting it is an important part of the process. 

2. The study emphasizes the importance of acid site neutralization for improving catalyst durability and selectivity. Hydrogen cofeeding may interact with acid sites in ways that affect coke formation and catalyst stability.

3. The distribution of Pt particles on both the outer and inner surfaces of the zeolite support could influence how hydrogen interacts with the catalyst and affects reaction mechanisms.

4. The focus on suppressing side reactions to improve propylene selectivity suggests that hydrogen cofeeding might play a role in this aspect, potentially by altering reaction energetics or competing with coke-forming pathways.

To fully understand the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in PDH, additional research focused on these aspects would be necessary.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。该研究主要关注向PtSn/SUZ-4催化剂中添加钠离子的影响，而非氢气的作用。

然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些一般性影响：

1. 提到的反应条件包括氢气共进料(H2/C3H8 = 1/3摩尔比)，表明这是过程中的重要组成部分。

2. 该研究强调中和酸性位点对提高催化剂耐久性和选择性的重要性。氢气共进料可能以影响积碳形成和催化剂稳定性的方式与酸性位点相互作用。

3. Pt粒子在分子筛载体的外表面和内表面的分布可能影响氢气与催化剂的相互作用方式，从而影响反应机理。

4. 研究关注抑制副反应以提高丙烯选择性，这表明氢气共进料可能在这方面发挥作用，可能是通过改变反应能量学或与形成积碳的途径竞争。

要充分理解氢气共进料对PDH中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响，需要进行针对这些方面的额外研究。
