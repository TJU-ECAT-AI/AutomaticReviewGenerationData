[1] "H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio)"

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular micro-reactor under reaction conditions of 0.1 MPa, 590 C, C3H8/H2 = 1/3 (molar ratio) and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 3.0 h1."

[3] "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. The acidity of the different catalysts was examined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia experiments."

[4] "In dehydrogenation processes, side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization) are mainly catalyzed by strong acid sites. Thus, neutralization of the strong acid sites reduces the undesirable side-reactions and improves propylene selectivity"

The document does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used as a cofeed in a 1:3 molar ratio with propane during the reaction. The paper focuses more on the effects of sodium additives on acid sites and catalyst performance rather than the role of hydrogen.

The document indicates that strong acid sites on the catalyst promote undesirable side reactions like cracking, isomerization and polymerization. These side reactions likely contribute to coke formation. By neutralizing strong acid sites with sodium additives, the catalyst showed improved propylene selectivity and reduced side reactions.

While the paper does not explicitly discuss hydrogen's impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, or graphitization, it does suggest that modifying catalyst acidity through additives can significantly influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. This implies that careful tuning of reaction conditions and catalyst properties is important for optimizing PDH process efficiency and performance.

该文档并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。不过，文中确实提到在反应中使用了1:3的丙烷与氢气摩尔比例作为共进料。该论文更多地关注钠添加剂对酸性位点和催化剂性能的影响，而非氢气的作用。

文档指出，催化剂上的强酸位点会促进不良的副反应，如裂解、异构化和聚合。这些副反应可能会导致积碳的形成。通过用钠添加剂中和强酸位点，催化剂表现出更好的丙烯选择性和减少的副反应。

虽然该论文没有明确讨论氢气对能量障碍、积碳累积模式或石墨化的影响，但它确实表明，通过添加剂调节催化剂酸性可以显著影响反应途径和产品选择性。这意味着仔细调整反应条件和催化剂性质对于优化PDH工艺效率和性能非常重要。
