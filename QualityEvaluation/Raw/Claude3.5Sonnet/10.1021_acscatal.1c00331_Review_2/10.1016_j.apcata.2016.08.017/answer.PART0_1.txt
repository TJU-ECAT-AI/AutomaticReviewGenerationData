[1] "As shown in Fig. 1, PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibited high initial reaction activities but poor propylene selectivity because of side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). It posed very poor stability, which was manifested by the quickly decreased propane conversion caused by the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. As shown in Fig. 1B and Table 1, propylene selectivities increased and the coke amount decreased along with the sodium ion content addition, which might be attributed to the reduction of acid sites in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2."

[3] "Thus, sodium ion additives might modify Pt distribution in the catalysts, and thus affected the coke distribution on zeolite and greatly affected the catalyst performances in propane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The document focuses on the effects of sodium ion additives on PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 zeolite for propane dehydrogenation, rather than discussing hydrogen cofeeding.

However, the literature does provide some relevant information about coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in PDH:

1. The PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst showed poor stability due to rapid deactivation, likely caused by coke formation from side reactions like cracking, isomerization, and polymerization.

2. Adding sodium ions to the catalyst reduced the amount of coke formation and increased propylene selectivity. This was attributed to the neutralization of acid sites on the zeolite support.

3. The distribution of platinum and coke on the catalyst was affected by sodium ion content, which in turn influenced catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation.

While the document does not discuss hydrogen cofeeding, these insights suggest that strategies to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability are important for improving PDH process efficiency and performance.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的影响。文档主要关注钠离子添加剂对SUZ-4沸石负载的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的影响，而不是讨论氢气共进料。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于PDH中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的相关信息：

1. PtSn/SUZ-4催化剂由于快速失活而表现出较差的稳定性，这可能是由裂解、异构化和聚合等副反应导致的积碳形成所致。

2. 向催化剂中添加钠离子可以减少积碳量并提高丙烯选择性。这被归因于沸石载体上酸性位点的中和。

3. 催化剂上铂和积碳的分布受钠离子含量的影响，这反过来又影响了催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能。

虽然文档没有讨论氢气共进料，但这些见解表明，减少积碳形成和提高催化剂稳定性的策略对于提高PDH过程效率和性能很重要。
