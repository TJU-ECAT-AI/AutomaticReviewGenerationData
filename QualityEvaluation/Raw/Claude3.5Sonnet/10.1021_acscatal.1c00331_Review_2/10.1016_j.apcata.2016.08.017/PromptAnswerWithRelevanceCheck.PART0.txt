[1] "H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio)"

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular micro-reactor under reaction conditions of 0.1 MPa, 590 C, C3H8/H2 = 1/3 (molar ratio) and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 3.0 h1."

[3] "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. The acidity of the different catalysts was examined by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia experiments."

[4] "In dehydrogenation processes, side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization) are mainly catalyzed by strong acid sites. Thus, neutralization of the strong acid sites reduces the undesirable side-reactions and improves propylene selectivity"

The document does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used as a cofeed in a 1:3 molar ratio with propane during the reaction. The paper focuses more on the effects of sodium additives on acid sites and catalyst performance rather than the role of hydrogen.

The document indicates that strong acid sites on the catalyst promote undesirable side reactions like cracking, isomerization and polymerization. These side reactions likely contribute to coke formation. By neutralizing strong acid sites with sodium additives, the catalyst showed improved propylene selectivity and reduced side reactions.

While the paper does not explicitly discuss hydrogen's impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, or graphitization, it does suggest that modifying catalyst acidity through additives can significantly influence reaction pathways and product selectivity. This implies that careful tuning of reaction conditions and catalyst properties is important for optimizing PDH process efficiency and performance.

该文档并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。不过，文中确实提到在反应中使用了1:3的丙烷与氢气摩尔比例作为共进料。该论文更多地关注钠添加剂对酸性位点和催化剂性能的影响，而非氢气的作用。

文档指出，催化剂上的强酸位点会促进不良的副反应，如裂解、异构化和聚合。这些副反应可能会导致积碳的形成。通过用钠添加剂中和强酸位点，催化剂表现出更好的丙烯选择性和减少的副反应。

虽然该论文没有明确讨论氢气对能量障碍、积碳累积模式或石墨化的影响，但它确实表明，通过添加剂调节催化剂酸性可以显著影响反应途径和产品选择性。这意味着仔细调整反应条件和催化剂性质对于优化PDH工艺效率和性能非常重要。

[1] "As shown in Fig. 1, PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibited high initial reaction activities but poor propylene selectivity because of side reactions (cracking, isomerization and polymerization). It posed very poor stability, which was manifested by the quickly decreased propane conversion caused by the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances. As shown in Fig. 1B and Table 1, propylene selectivities increased and the coke amount decreased along with the sodium ion content addition, which might be attributed to the reduction of acid sites in the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2."

[3] "Thus, sodium ion additives might modify Pt distribution in the catalysts, and thus affected the coke distribution on zeolite and greatly affected the catalyst performances in propane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The document focuses on the effects of sodium ion additives on PtSn catalysts supported on SUZ-4 zeolite for propane dehydrogenation, rather than discussing hydrogen cofeeding.

However, the literature does provide some relevant information about coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in PDH:

1. The PtSn/SUZ-4 catalyst showed poor stability due to rapid deactivation, likely caused by coke formation from side reactions like cracking, isomerization, and polymerization.

2. Adding sodium ions to the catalyst reduced the amount of coke formation and increased propylene selectivity. This was attributed to the neutralization of acid sites on the zeolite support.

3. The distribution of platinum and coke on the catalyst was affected by sodium ion content, which in turn influenced catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation.

While the document does not discuss hydrogen cofeeding, these insights suggest that strategies to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability are important for improving PDH process efficiency and performance.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程的影响。文档主要关注钠离子添加剂对SUZ-4沸石负载的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的影响，而不是讨论氢气共进料。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于PDH中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的相关信息：

1. PtSn/SUZ-4催化剂由于快速失活而表现出较差的稳定性，这可能是由裂解、异构化和聚合等副反应导致的积碳形成所致。

2. 向催化剂中添加钠离子可以减少积碳量并提高丙烯选择性。这被归因于沸石载体上酸性位点的中和。

3. 催化剂上铂和积碳的分布受钠离子含量的影响，这反过来又影响了催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能。

虽然文档没有讨论氢气共进料，但这些见解表明，减少积碳形成和提高催化剂稳定性的策略对于提高PDH过程效率和性能很重要。

[1] "Reaction conditions: 590 C, H2/C3H8 = 1/3 (molar ratio), m (cat.) = 0.3 g, WHSV = 3.0 h1."

[2] "Generally, the surface area and acid sites of zeolite with regular pore structure are mainly provided by its inner surface. Pt metal particles disperse on both the outside and inner surface of zeolite."

[3] "The phenomena were caused by the neutralization of the stronger acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite, which prevented the Pt acid precursor (H2PtCl6) entering into the SUZ-4 channel."

[4] "Sodium ion additives neutralized the strong acid sites on SUZ-4 zeolite and enhanced the catalyst durability and propylene selectivity by suppressing the side reactions in propane dehydrogenation processes."

The literature does not directly address how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study focuses on the effects of sodium ion addition to PtSn/SUZ-4 catalysts rather than the role of hydrogen.

However, we can infer some general implications based on the information provided:

1. The reaction conditions mentioned include hydrogen cofeeding (H2/C3H8 = 1/3 molar ratio), suggesting it is an important part of the process. 

2. The study emphasizes the importance of acid site neutralization for improving catalyst durability and selectivity. Hydrogen cofeeding may interact with acid sites in ways that affect coke formation and catalyst stability.

3. The distribution of Pt particles on both the outer and inner surfaces of the zeolite support could influence how hydrogen interacts with the catalyst and affects reaction mechanisms.

4. The focus on suppressing side reactions to improve propylene selectivity suggests that hydrogen cofeeding might play a role in this aspect, potentially by altering reaction energetics or competing with coke-forming pathways.

To fully understand the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in PDH, additional research focused on these aspects would be necessary.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理。该研究主要关注向PtSn/SUZ-4催化剂中添加钠离子的影响，而非氢气的作用。

然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些一般性影响：

1. 提到的反应条件包括氢气共进料(H2/C3H8 = 1/3摩尔比)，表明这是过程中的重要组成部分。

2. 该研究强调中和酸性位点对提高催化剂耐久性和选择性的重要性。氢气共进料可能以影响积碳形成和催化剂稳定性的方式与酸性位点相互作用。

3. Pt粒子在分子筛载体的外表面和内表面的分布可能影响氢气与催化剂的相互作用方式，从而影响反应机理。

4. 研究关注抑制副反应以提高丙烯选择性，这表明氢气共进料可能在这方面发挥作用，可能是通过改变反应能量学或与形成积碳的途径竞争。

要充分理解氢气共进料对PDH中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响，需要进行针对这些方面的额外研究。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is cofed with propane at a H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 1/3 in the reaction conditions. 

The study focuses more on the effects of sodium ion addition to PtSn/SUZ-4 catalysts. It shows that neutralizing strong acid sites reduces side reactions like cracking, isomerization, and polymerization, which improves propylene selectivity. The addition of sodium ions decreased coke formation and increased propylene selectivity, likely due to the reduction of acid sites on the catalyst.

While the paper doesn't directly address the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, or graphitization, it does suggest that modifying the catalyst's acidity plays a crucial role in controlling coke formation and improving catalyst performance. The overall process efficiency and performance appear to be more influenced by catalyst composition and acidity rather than hydrogen cofeeding in this particular study.

这篇文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何具体影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的全面信息。但是，它确实提到在反应条件下，氢气与丙烷以1/3的摩尔比共进料。

这项研究更多地关注了向PtSn/SUZ-4催化剂中添加钠离子的影响。研究表明，中和强酸位点可以减少裂化、异构化和聚合等副反应，从而提高丙烯的选择性。添加钠离子减少了积碳形成并提高了丙烯选择性，这可能是由于催化剂上酸位点的减少。

虽然这篇文章没有直接讨论氢气共进料对能量势垒、积碳累积模式或石墨化的影响，但它确实表明调节催化剂的酸性在控制积碳形成和提高催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。在这项特定研究中，整个过程的效率和性能似乎更多地受到催化剂组成和酸性的影响，而不是氢气共进料的影响。

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响。然而，它确实提到在反应条件下使用了1:3的丙烷与氢气摩尔比。这篇论文更多地关注了钠离子添加剂对酸性位点和催化剂性能的影响。文中指出，中和强酸性位点可以减少不良副反应并提高丙烯选择性，这可能间接与焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性有关。由于缺乏关于氢气作用的更具体信息，无法评论其对PDH中能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化、石墨化或整体过程效率和性能的影响。
