[1] "Generally, sodium ion additives largely affected the acid sites of zeolite and the catalyst performances."

[2] "Thus, neutralization of the strong acid sites reduces the undesirable side-reactions and improves propylene selectivity"

[3] "C3H8/H2 = 1/3 (molar ratio)"

The literature does not directly address the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen was used in a 1:3 molar ratio with propane in the reaction conditions. The paper focuses more on the effects of sodium ion additives on acid sites and catalyst performance. It notes that neutralizing strong acid sites reduces undesirable side reactions and improves propylene selectivity, which could indirectly relate to coke formation and catalyst stability. Without more specific information on hydrogen's role, it's not possible to comment on its impact on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency and performance in PDH.

该文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的影响。然而，它确实提到在反应条件下使用了1:3的丙烷与氢气摩尔比。这篇论文更多地关注了钠离子添加剂对酸性位点和催化剂性能的影响。文中指出，中和强酸性位点可以减少不良副反应并提高丙烯选择性，这可能间接与焦炭形成和催化剂稳定性有关。由于缺乏关于氢气作用的更具体信息，无法评论其对PDH中能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位点转化、石墨化或整体过程效率和性能的影响。
