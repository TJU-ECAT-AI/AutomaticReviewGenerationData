 Introduction
Bimetallic
 platinum-tin
 (Pt-Sn)-based
 catalysts
 have
 attracted
much
 attention
 for
 their
 industrial
 application
 potential
 in
 recent
years.
 [13].
 They
 have
 been
 widely
 employed
 in
 many
 reactions,
such
 as
 light
 paraffin
 dehydrogenation
 [1,4,5],
 alcohol
 oxidation
[6,7]
 and
 the
 hydrogenation
 for
 carbonyl
 compounds
 [8,9]
 et
 al.
Among
 these
 applications,
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 to
 produce
propylene
 is
 a
 significant
 petrochemical
 process
 for
 the
 rapidly
increasing
 demand
 of
 propylene
 [10,11].
 However,
 current
 reaction
conditions
 suffer
 high
 temperature
 and
 low
 H2 partial
 pressure,
which
 leads
 to
 undesirable
 thermal
 cracking
 reactions
 to
 coke
and
 light
 alkanes
 and
 results
 in
 low
 product
 yield
 and
 eventu-
ally
 deactivation
 of
 the
 catalyst
 [1113].
 Therefore,
 developing
 an
efficient
 catalyst
 with
 high
 activity,
 high
 stability
 and
 high
 propy-
lene
 selectivity
 is
 urgently
 required.
 The
 conventionally
 employed
PtSn/-Al2O3 is
 considered
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 most
 efficient
 catalysts
for
 propane
 dehydrogenation,
 but
 is
 deficiency
 for
 their
 poor
 sta-
bility
 and
 weak
 durability
 after
 recoveries
 [10,14,15].
 To
 resolve
the
 problem,
 additives,
 including
 alkali
 metals
 (K,
 Na)
 and
 rare
earth
 metals
 (La,
 Ce)
 have
 been
 employed
 to
 improve
 the
 catalysts
[14,1618].

Yet,
 zeolite
 has
 been
 used
 as
 support
 for
 Pt-Sn-based
 catalysts
owing
 to
 its
 high
 surface
 area,
 high
 thermal
 stability
 and
 tunable
Si/Al
 ratio
 [3].
 Among
 these
 materials,
 SUZ-4
 is
 a
 novel
 zeolite
patented
 by
 the
 British
 Petroleum
 Company
 in
 1992.
 The
 three
dimensional
 topological
 structure
 of
 this
 material
 has
 straight
 ten-
membered
 channels
 intersected
 by
 two
 eight-membered
 channels
at
 an
 angle
 of
 about
 74,
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 ZSM-5
 zeolite
 [1921].
 H-
SUZ-4
 zeolite
 possess
 large
 amount
 of
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites
 stronger
than
 those
 on
 H-ZSM-5
 zeolite
 [22].
 Therefore,
 it
 has
 presented
considerably
 high
 catalytic
 activity
 in
 many
 reactions,
 such
 as
 con-
version
 of
 n-hexane
 [20],
 the
 synthesis
 of
 dimethyl
 ether
 from
methanol
 [23],
 and
 the
 elimination
 of
 nitrogen
 oxides
 [22,24].
SUZ-4
 zeolite-supported
 catalysts
 might
 be
 employed
 in
 propane
dehydrogenation.
 But
 up
 to
 present,
 few
 studies
 have
 been
 reported
in
 the
 field
 while
 the
 ZSM-5-supported
 catalysts
 have
 attracted
much
 attention.
 Compared
 with
 -Al2O3,
 ZSM-5
 zeolite
 possesses
a
 special
 three
 dimensional
 topological
 structure,
 which
 can
 inhibit
the
 production
 of
 large
 hydrocarbon
 molecules
 to
 suppress
 the
 coke
deposits
 and
 enhance
 the
 catalyst
 stability
 [25].
 Recently,
 Zhou
et.
 al
 investigated
 the
 effect
 of
 promoters
 of
 PtSn/ZSM-5
 catalyst
for
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 and
 found
 that
 introduction
 of
 the
third
 or
 fourth
 promoter
 (K,
 La)
 could
 improve
 the
 catalyst
 activ-
ity
 by
 decreasing
 the
 acid
 sites
 of
 the
 support
 and
 strengthening
the
 interaction
 between
 Sn
 and
 the
 carrier
 [26,27].
 In
 this
 paper,
we
 employed
 SUZ-4
 zeolite-supported
 PtSn
 catalysts
 in
 propane
dehydrogenation
 with
 sodium
 ion
 as
 the
 additive
 to
 improve
 the
catalyst.
 The
 effects
 of
 sodium
 ion
 addition
 were

tigated
 by
 testing
 a
 series
 of
 catalysts
 with
 different
 sodium
 ion
contents
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation.
 Herein,
 we  wish
 to
 report
our
 findings.
2.
 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
SUZ-4
 zeolite
 was
 prepared
 by
 the
 hydrothermal
 crystallization
method,
 as
 described
 in
 literature
 [28].
 The
 solid
 phase
 obtained
was
 filtered,
 washed
 with
 distilled
 water
 for
 several
 times,
 dried
at
 110 C
 for
 12
 h
 and
 then
 calcined
 at
 550 C
 for
 4
 h,
 followed
 by
NH4+-exchange
 with
 1
 M
 aqueous
 NH4Cl.
 H-SUZ-4
 was
 obtained
by
 calcining
 the
 ammonium
 form
 of
 SUZ-4
 at
 550 C
 for
 4
 h.
The
 PtSnNa
 catalysts
 supported
 on
 SUZ-4
 zeolite
 (Pt
 0.5wt
 %,
 Sn
2.0wt
 %,
 Na
 02.0wt
 %)
 were
 prepared
 by
 impregnating
 H-SUZ-4
into
 (H2PtCl6 +
 SnCl4)
 aqueous
 mixture
 (H2PtCl6 5
 mg/ml,
 SnCl4
5.85
 mg/ml)
 and
 aqueous
 NaCl
 (0.5
 mol/L)
 respectively
 in
 order.
 The
samples
 were
 dried
 at
 110 C
 for
 4
 h,
 calcined
 in
 air
 at
 520 C
 for
4
 h,
 and
 then
 dechlorinated
 in
 air
 containing
 water
 vapor
 at
 530 C
for
 4
 h.
 The
 PtSnNa
 catalyst
 with
 different
 sodium
 ion
 content
 was
described
 as
 PtSnNa(m)/SUZ-4
 (m
 =
 0.5,
 1,
 1.5
 and
 2)
 in
 the
 whole
paper.
2.2.
 Catalyst
 characterization
The
 powder
 X-ray
 diffraction
 (XRD)
 patterns
 of
 all
 samples
 were
obtained
 on
 a
 Philips
 Xpert
 pro
 diffractometer
 using
 Cu
 Ka
 radia-
tion
 at
 40
 kV
 and
 40
 mA,
 from
 5to
 50.
The
 surface
 area
 was
 calculated
 by
 the
 BET
 method
 according
to
 N2 adsorption
 isotherms
 recorded
 at
 the
 temperature
 of
 liquid
nitrogen
 using
 a
 Micromeritics
 ASAP2010
 analyzer.
 The
 samples
were
 degassed
 at
 300 C
 and
 1
 ×
 103 Torr
 before
 analysis,
 then
measured
 at
 196 C.
H2 chemisorption
 on
 supported
 catalysts
 before
 and
 after
propane
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 was
 carried
 out
 according
 to
the
 procedure
 described
 in
 the
 literature
 [29].
 All
 catalyst
 samples
were
 reduced
 in
 H2 flow
 at
 500 C
 for
 2
 h
 and
 then
 out-gassed
 in
 an
Ar
 flow
 at
 540 C
 for
 2
 h
 before
 H2 chemisorption
 measurements.
NH3-TPD
 profiles
 of
 the
 samples
 were
 carried
 out
 in
 a
 flow-
type
 fixed-bed
 reactor
 at
 the
 ambient
 pressure.
 The
 catalysts
 were
pre-treated
 at
 500 C
 for
 2
 h
 in
 argon
 flow.
 The
 NH3 adsorption
 tem-
perature
 was
 100 C,
 and
 the
 temperature
 was
 raised
 at
 a
 rate
 of
10 C/min.
 The
 desorbed
 NH3 was
 detected
 by
 gas
 chromatography
equipped
 with
 TCD.
The
 amount
 of
 carbon
 deposited
 on
 the
 catalysts
 during
propane
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 was
 measured
 by
 using
 thermo-
gravimetric
 (TG)
 analysis
 (STA
 449C-Thermal
 star
 300
 TA-MS
apparatus).
 The
 catalyst
 samples
 (ca.  0.02
 g)
 after
 reaction
 for
 10
 h
were
 heated
 from
 room
 temperature
 to
 900 C
 in
 O2 (25
 ml/min)
with
 heating
 rate
 of
 10 C/min,
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 coke
 was
 calcu-
lated
 from
 TG
 curves.
Temperature-programmed
 oxidation
 (TPO)
 was
 measured
 with
the
 same
 apparatus
 as
 used
 for
 H2 chemisorption
 experiments.
About
 0.1
 g
 of
 sample
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 quartz
 reactor
 and
 then
 heated
up
 to
 800 C
 in
 O2 (3.0
 ml/min)
 and
 Ar
 (30
 ml/min)
 mixture
 with
 a
rate
 of
 10 C/min.
Temperature-programmed
 reduction
 (TPR)
 was
 measured
 with
the
 same
 apparatus
 as
 used
 for
 TPO
 experiments.
 About
 0.1
 g
 of
sample
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 quartz
 reactor
 and
 then
 performed
 in
 a
flow
 of
 5%
 H2/Ar
 (20
 ml/min)
 with
 heating
 rate
 of
 10 C/min.
The
 poisoned
 catalysts
 (S
 0.02wt
 %)
 were
 prepared
 by
 impreg-
nating
 the
 reduced
 PtSnNa/SUZ-4
 catalyst
 into
 the
 ethanol
 solution
of
 dibenzo[b,d]thiophene
 and
 flushed
 with
 nitrogen.
 The
 samples
were
 dried
 at
 110 C
 for
 4
 h.

 Results
 and
 discussion
3.1.
 Propane
 dehydrogenation
A
 series
 of
 catalysts
 with
 different
 sodium
 ion
 contents
 were
employed
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 1,
PtSn/SUZ-4
 catalyst
 exhibited
 high
 initial
 reaction
 activities
 but
poor
 propylene
 selectivity
 because
 of
 side
 reactions
 (cracking,
isomerization
 and
 polymerization).
 It
 posed
 very
 poor
 stability,
which
 was
 manifested
 by
 the
 quickly
 decreased
 propane
 conver-
sion
 caused
 by
 the
 catalyst
 deactivation.
 (Fig.
 1A,
 curve
 a;
 Fig.
 1B,
curve
 a).
 The
 PtSnNa
 catalysts,
 exhibited
 lower
 initial
 propane
 con-
version
 but
 were
 more
 durable.
 Obviously,
 sodium
 ion
 as
 additive
largely
 improved
 the
 catalyst
 durability,
 which
 led
 to
 the
 stable
high
 propane
 conversion
 (Fig.
 1A,
 curves
 b-e
 vs.
 a)
 and
 high
 propy-
lene
 yields
 (Fig.
 1C,
 curves
 b-d
 vs.
 a),
 but
 the
 reactivity
 especially
the
 initial
 reactivity
 of
 the
 catalyst
 was
 lowered.
 Excess
 sodium
 ion
was
 harmful
 on
 the
 contrary
 and
 it
 was
 found
 that
 within
 1.5wt
 %
content
 of
 the
 sodium
 ion
 was
 favorable
 (Fig.
 1C,
 curves
 b-d
 vs.
 e).
3.2.
 Structure
 and
 surface
 properties
 of
 the
 catalysts
X-ray
 diffractions
 (XRD)
 experiments
 of
 the
 materials
 were
 then
performed.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 no
 signals
 of
 Pt,
 Sn
 or
 Na
 were
observed
 after
 the
 impregnation,
 possibly
 due
 to
 their
 low
 concen-
tration
 and/or
 the
 high
 dispersion
 states
 of
 these
 metal
 elements
(Fig.
 2,
 curves
 b1,
 c,
 d1,
 e
 and
 f)
 [25]. Moreover,
 compared
 with
 the
original
 structure
 of
 SUZ-4
 zeolite,
 the
 XRD
 patterns
 of
 the
 sup-
ported
 catalysts
 did
 not
 show
 any
 characteristic
 changes
 (Fig.
 2,
curves
 a
 vs.
 bf).
 After
 the
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 reaction
 for
10
 h,
 the
 signals
 of
 SUZ-4
 zeolite
 were
 also
 observed
 in
 the
 cat-
alysts,
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 curves
 b2 and
 d2,
 which
 indicated
 the
structure
 of
 the
 supports
 was
 not
 destructed
 during
 the
 reaction.
Table
 1
 affords
 the
 characterization
 data
 of
 the
 different
 cat-
alysts.
 It
 was
 shown
 that
 the
 pore
 volume
 (Vp)
 and
 surface
 area
decreased
 in
 supported
 catalysts
 and
 these
 values
 further
 went
down
 after
 the
 reaction
 (Table
 1,
 entries
 26
 vs.
 1).
 The
 phenomena
might
 be
 caused
 by
 the
 occupation
 of
 the
 catalyst
 metal
 Pt
 or
 coke
on
 support
 pores.
 And
 among
 these
 supported
 catalysts,
 the
 surface
area
 of
 PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4
 was
 the
 smallest
 one
 (entry
 6).
 H2 uptake
of
 the
 fresh
 PtSnNa/SUZ-4
 catalyst
 increased
 with
 the
 sodium
 ion
content
 before
 1.0wt
 %.
 It
 is
 shown
 that
 sodium
 ion
 additives
 were

Generally,
 sodium

 additives
 largely
 affected
 the

 and
 the

 performances.
 The

 examined
 by
 temperature-programmed

 of
 ammonia
 experiments.
 The
 NH3-TPD

 were

played
 in

 while
 the

 data
 were

 in

Two

 for

 The

 (curve

 As
 the
 peak
 area
 of
 a
 TPD
 pro-
file
 represented
 the
 amount
 of
 desorbed
 NH3 (calculate
 from
 the
total
 desorption
 peak
 area),
 whereas
 the
 peak
 position
 displayed
the
 strength
 of
 acidity,
 the
 addition
 of
 tin
 and
 sodium
 promoters
could
 neutralize
 the
 strong
 acid
 sites
 of
 zeolites
 preferentially,
 and
led
 to
 the
 reduced
 amount
 and
 intensity
 of
 the
 strong
 acid
 sites.
Generally,
 the
 surface
 area
 and
 acid
 sites
 of
 zeolite
 with
 regular
pore
 structure
 are
 mainly
 provided
 by
 its
 inner
 surface.
 Pt
 metal
particles
 disperse
 on
 both
 the
 outside
 and
 inner
 surface
 of
 zeolite.
Pt
 acid
 precursor
 (H2PtCl6)
 is
 prevented
 to
 enter
 the
 SUZ-4
 channel
because
 of
 stronger
 acid
 strength
 of
 SUZ-4
 zeolite
 [31].
 But
 the
 addi-
tion
 of
 sodium
 ion
 can
 neutralize
 the
 strong
 acid
 sites
 and
 promotes
the
 dispersion
 and
 combination
 of
 the
 catalyst
 precursor
 into
 the
inner
 surface
 of
 SUZ-4,
 leading
 tothe
 decrease
 of
 the
 surface
 area
and
 pore
 volume
 of
 the
 catalyst.
In
 dehydrogenation
 processes,
 side
 reactions
 (cracking,
 isomer-
ization
 and
 polymerization)
 are
 mainly
 catalyzed
 by
 strong
 acid
sites.
 Thus,
 neutralization
 of
 the
 strong
 acid
 sites
 reduces
 the
 unde-
sirable
 side-reactions
 and
 improves
 propylene
 selectivity
 [32]. As
shown
 in
 Fig.
 1B
 and
 Table
 1,
 propylene
 selectivities
 increased
 and
the
 coke
 amount
 decreased
 along
 with
 the
 sodium
 ion
 content
 addi-
tion,
 which
 might
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 reduction
 of
 acid
 sites
 in
the
 PtSnNa/SUZ-4
 catalysts
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3
 and
 Table
 2.
 However,
in
 PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4,
 although
 the
 coke
 amount
 decreased
 to
 6.8
(Table
 1,
 entry
 6),
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane
 declined
 to
 8.7
 mol%
(Fig.
 1A,
 curve
 e).
 Thus,
 it
 was
 suggested
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 coke
deposits
 affected
 by
 the
 sodium
 ion
 addition
 was
 a
 significant
 rea-
son
 but
 not
 the
 only
 one
 for
 the
 variation
 of
 catalyst
 activity.
3.3.
 Pre-treatment
 experiment
 with
 dibenzo[b,d]thiophene
To
 
investigate
 
the
 
detailed
 
structure
 
of
 
the
 
materials,
experiments
 
using
 
dibenzo[b,d]thiophene-poisoned
 
catalysts
were
 tested.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 4,
 for
 all
 of
 the
 PtSn/SUZ-4,
PtSnNa(1.0)/SUZ-4
 and
 PtSnNa(1.5)/SUZ-4
 catalysts,
 their
 activi-
ties
 decreased
 after
 treating
 with
 dibenzo[b,d]thiophene
 (Figs.
 4A,
 B
and
 C),
 but
 the
 activity
 of
 PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4
 was
 nearly
 unchanged
after
 being
 treated
 with
 dibenzo[b,d]thiophene
 (Fig.
 4D).
 Because
dibenzo[b,d]thiophene
 had
 larger
 molecule
 diameter
 (ca.  0.8
 nm)
than
 the
 tunnels
 of
 SUZ-4
 zeolite
 (ca.0.460.52
 nm)[29,33],
 it
could
 only
 contact
 with
 the
 surface
 Pt
 catalyst,
 while
 the
 catalyst
Pt
 particles
 inside
 the
 tunnels
 remained
 untouched.
 Therefore,
the
 proportion
 of
 Pt
 inside
 the
 pores
 of
 zeolite
 can
 be
 analyzed

 the

 of

 between
 the

 with

 and

 (P/F).
As
 shown
 in
 Table
 3,
 the
 ratio
 of
 P/F
 increased
 with
 the
 sodium
ion
 addition,
 indicating
 the
 increased
 Pt
 dispersion
 inside
 the
channels.
 When
 PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4
 was
 employed,
 almost
 all
 of
the
 Pt
 particles
 went
 into
 the
 channel
 of
 zeolite,
 resulting
 in
 a
sharp
 drop
 in
 surface
 area,
 and
 under
 these
 conditions,
 the
 carbon
deposits
 could
 easily
 block
 the
 channels
 of
 SUZ-4
 and
 deactivate
the
 catalysts
 (Table
 1,
 entry
 6).
 The
 phenomena
 were
 caused
 by
the
 neutralization
 of
 the
 stronger
 acid
 sites
 of
 SUZ-4
 zeolite,
 which
prevented
 the
 Pt
 acid
 precursor
 (H2PtCl6)
 entering
 into
 the
 SUZ-4
channel.
The
 differences
 of
 Pt
 distribution
 inside
 and
 outside
 the
 channels
of
 the
 catalysts
 might
 lead
 to
 the
 different
 distribution
 of
 carbon
deposition.
 Temperature-programmed-oxidation
 (TPO)
 profiles
 of
different
 catalysts
 were
 illustrated
 in
 Fig.
 5.
 For
 PtSn/SUZ-4
 cata-
lyst,
 two
 successive
 peaks
 representing
 different
 carbon
 deposits
were
 observed.
 The
 first
 peak
 at
 ca.
 520 C
 should
 be
 attributed
 to
carbon
 deposits
 that
 covered
 the
 catalyst
 metal
 Pt,
 while
 the
 sec-
ond
 peak
 at
 higher
 ca.
 630 C
 was
 for
 the
 carbon
 deposit
 located
 on
zeolite
 surface,
 as
 in
 good
 agreement
 with
 the
 reported
 literature
(curve
 a)
 [2].
 It
 is
 worth
 noting
 that
 the
 high
 temperature
 peaks
split
 with
 the
 addition
 of
 sodium
 ion
 (curves
 bd
 vs.
 a).
 Consid-
ering
 the
 experimental
 results
 of
 pre-treatment
 experiment
 with
dibenzo[b,d]thiophene
 (Fig.
 4),
 the
 peaks
 at
 low
 temperature
 in
the
 PtSnNa(m)/SUZ-4
 catalysts
 were
 probably
 ascribed
 to
 carbon
deposits
 that
 cover
 the
 Pt
 surface
 inside
 the
 zeolite
 pores,
 while
the
 peaks
 at
 high
 temperature
 could
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 carbon
deposit
 in
 zeolite
 channels
 (curves
 b-d).
 Hence,
 sodium
 ion
 addi-
tives
 might
 modify
 Pt
 distribution
 in
 the
 catalysts,
 and
 thus
 affected

 greatly

3.4.
 Interaction
 of
 catalyst
 components
Previous
 studies
 have
 indicated
 that
 the
 interaction
 between
 Pt-
Sn-support
 was
 an
 important
 factor
 that
 affected
 the
 state
 of
 the
 Sn
component,
 the
 state
 of
 the
 Pt
 dispersion
 and
 the
 dehydrogenation
performance
 of
 the
 catalyst
 [34,35].
 For
 catalysts
 with
 high
 con-
tent
 of
 metal
 components
 but
 low
 dispersion,
 it
 is
 difficult
 to
 get
enough
 information
 on
 the
 catalyst
 active
 phase
 structure
 through
XRD
 and
 XPS
 methods.
 In
 order
 to
 further
 disclose
 the
 interaction
 of
each
 component
 in
 the
 PtSnNa
 supported
 catalysts,
 temperature-
programmed-reactions
 (TPR)
 with
 H2 were
 then
 investigated.
 As
shown
 in
 Fig.
 6,
 a
 broad
 but
 weak
 reduction
 peak
 was
 observed
 at
350 C
 for
 Pt/SUZ-4
 sample,
 indicating
 that
 most
 Pt(II)
 decomposed
to
 Pt(0)
 after
 calcination
 (curve
 a)
 [36].
 For
 Sn/SUZ-4,
 two
 TPR
 peaks
were
 observed:
 the
 peak
 at
 300 C
 was
 attributed
 to
 be
 the
 reduc-
tion
 of
 Sn(IV)
 to
 Sn(II),
 while
 the
 peak
 at
 520 C
 clearly
 indicated
 the
reduction
 of
 Sn(IV)
 or
 Sn(II)
 to
 Sn(0)
 (curve
 b)
 [37].
 The
 addition
 of
Pt
 made
 Sn
 was
 easier
 to
 be
 reduced,
 as
 the
 signals
 of
 PtSn/SUZ-
4
 moved
 to
 low
 temperature
 direction
 (curves
 c
 vs.
 b).
 Compared
with
 PtSn/SUZ-4,
 addition
 of
 sodium
 ions
 led
 to
 the
 increase
 of
 TPR
peak
 area.
 Moreover,
 Sn(II)
 to
 Sn(0)
 TPR
 peak
 moved
 to
 lower
 tem-
perature,
 showing
 that
 Sn
 species
 in
 the
 PtSnNa/SUZ-4
 was
 much
easier
 to
 be
 reduced
 to
 metallic
 Sn
 especially
 for
 PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-
4
 (curves
 d-g
 vs.
 c).
 Then
 the
 coverage
 of
 surface
 Pt
 by
 metallic
Sn
 species
 on
 the
 Pt-Sn
 alloys
 may
 lead
 to
 the
 decreases
 of
 H2
uptake
 and
 reduced
 catalyst
 activity
 for
 hydrocarbon
 dehydrogena-
tion
 [38,39].
 Thus,
 excess
 sodium
 ion
 content
 in
 PtSnNa(2.0)/SUZ-4
resulted
 in
 poor
 catalyst
 performances
 on
 the
 contrary.
4.
 Conclusions
In
 conclusion,
 sodium
 ion
 contents
 neutralized
 the
 strong
 acid
sites
 on
 SUZ-4
 zeolite
 and
 enhanced
 the
 catalyst
 durability
 and
propylene
 selectivity
 by
 suppressing
 the
 side
 reactions
 in
 propane
dehydrogenation
 processes.
 Although
 the
 reactivity
 of
 the
 catalyst
might
 be
 lowered
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 reaction,
 the
 propylene
selectivity
 and
 catalytic
 stability
 were
 largely
 improved,
 which

35
was
 even
 more
 important
 factors
 in
 industrial
 production.
 How-
ever,
 over-addition
 of
 sodium
 ion
 largely
 deactivated
 the
 catalyst
because
 of
 the
 decreased
 surface
 area
 and
 the
 reduction
 of
 Sn(II)
to
 Sn(0),
 which
 led
 to
 PtSn
 alloys
 with
 Pt
 and
 reduced
 the
 catalyst
activity.
 Over-addition
 of
 sodium
 ion
 also
 led
 to
 more
 Pt
 clusters
inside
 the
 pores
 because
 of
 the
 neutralization
 of
 strong
 acid
 sites
that
 allowed
 the
 entrance
 of
 Pt
 precursor
 (H2PtCl6)
 into
 zeolite
channels.
 Since
 Pt
 inside
 the
 pores
 could
 be
 easily
 deactivated
 by
coke
 deposition,
 the
 effect
 was
 harmful
 to
 catalyst.
 Therefore,
 an
adequate
 addition
 of
 sodium
 ion
 additives
 is
 a
 key
 factor
 for
 the
catalyst
 designing
 and
 it
 was
 found
 that
 addition
 of
 0.51.5wt
 %
sodium
 ion
 content
 should
 be
 the
 best
 protocol
 in
 PtSnNa/SUZ-4
catalyst
 designing.
