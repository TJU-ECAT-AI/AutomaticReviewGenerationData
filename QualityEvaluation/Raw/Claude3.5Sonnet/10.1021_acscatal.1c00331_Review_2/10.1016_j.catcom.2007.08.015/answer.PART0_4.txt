[1] "The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8 and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total flow of 150 ml/min."

[2] "Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles. However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%) (Fig. 2b)."

[3] "The initial rate of coking is an order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher (0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study only mentions using a feed with 13 vol.% H2, but does not compare this to conditions without hydrogen cofeeding.

However, the study does provide some insights into coke formation and catalyst performance based on Pt particle size. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher initial propane conversion but lower propene selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm). The smaller particles also exhibited much higher rates of coking and selectivity to coke formation.

These findings suggest that Pt particle size significantly influences reaction pathways and coke formation in PDH. While not directly addressing hydrogen cofeeding effects, this information implies that catalyst design and operating conditions play crucial roles in balancing activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH processes.

The study does not discuss energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization in relation to hydrogen cofeeding or coke formation. To fully answer the question, additional research specifically focused on hydrogen cofeeding effects in PDH would be needed.

该文献没有提供关于氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的全面信息。研究仅提到使用含13体积%氢气的进料，但没有与不含氢气共进料的条件进行比较。

然而，该研究确实基于Pt粒子尺寸提供了一些关于积碳形成和催化剂性能的见解。较小的Pt粒子(3 nm)表现出更高的初始丙烷转化率，但与较大粒子(21 nm)相比，丙烯选择性较低。较小的粒子还表现出更高的积碳速率和积碳形成选择性。

这些发现表明，Pt粒子尺寸显著影响PDH中的反应途径和积碳形成。虽然没有直接讨论氢气共进料的影响，但这些信息暗示催化剂设计和操作条件在平衡PDH过程中的活性、选择性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。

该研究没有讨论与氢气共进料或积碳形成相关的能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行专门针对PDH中氢气共进料影响的额外研究。
