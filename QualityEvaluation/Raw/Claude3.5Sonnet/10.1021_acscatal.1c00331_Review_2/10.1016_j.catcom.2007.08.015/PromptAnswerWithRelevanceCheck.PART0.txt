The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study only mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed gas, but does not compare this to runs without hydrogen or discuss its specific effects. 

Based on the limited information provided, we can infer that hydrogen cofeeding was used in this PDH process, likely to help suppress coke formation. However, the study focuses more on the effects of platinum particle size rather than the role of hydrogen. It shows that smaller Pt particles (3 nm) led to higher rates of coking and more coke formation compared to larger particles (21 nm), despite the presence of hydrogen in the feed. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alone may not be sufficient to prevent coking, especially with very small catalyst particles that are highly active but less selective.

The study does not discuss energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency in relation to hydrogen cofeeding. To fully answer the question, additional research specifically focused on the effects of hydrogen in PDH would be needed.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的问题。该研究仅提到进料气中包含氢气,但没有与不含氢气的运行进行比较或讨论其具体影响。

根据所提供的有限信息,我们可以推断该PDH过程使用了氢气共进料,可能是为了帮助抑制积碳形成。然而,该研究更多地关注铂粒子尺寸的影响,而不是氢气的作用。研究表明,尽管进料中存在氢气,较小的Pt粒子(3 nm)与较大的粒子(21 nm)相比,导致更高的积碳速率和更多的积碳形成。这表明,仅靠氢气共进料可能不足以防止积碳,特别是在使用活性很高但选择性较低的极小催化剂粒子时。

该研究没有讨论与氢气共进料相关的能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化、石墨化或整体过程效率。要全面回答这个问题,需要进行专门针对氢气在PDH中的影响的额外研究。

The literature does not directly address the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some inferences can be made based on the information provided:

1. The study used a feed containing 13 vol.% H2, indicating that hydrogen cofeeding was part of the experimental setup. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding is a standard practice in PDH processes.

2. The presence of hydrogen in the feed likely affects the reaction equilibrium and may help suppress coke formation to some extent, though the exact impact is not explicitly stated.

3. Catalyst stability appears to be influenced more by particle size than hydrogen cofeeding in this study. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher initial activity but faster deactivation due to coking, while larger particles (21 nm) were more stable and selective towards propylene production.

4. The reaction mechanism seems to involve a balance between C-C and C-H bond activation. Hydrogen cofeeding may influence this balance, potentially favoring C-H bond activation (dehydrogenation) over C-C bond breaking (cracking).

5. Coke formation appears to selectively deactivate sites responsible for C-C bond activation, which actually improves selectivity towards the desired propylene product. Hydrogen cofeeding might modulate this effect, but the specific impact is not detailed in the given literature.

Overall, while the study does not directly address the question, it suggests that hydrogen cofeeding is an important parameter in PDH processes, likely influencing reaction equilibrium, coke formation, and selectivity. However, other factors such as catalyst particle size also play crucial roles in determining process efficiency and performance.

该文献没有直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响。然而，根据所提供的信息可以进行一些推断：

1. 研究使用的进料中含有13体积%的H2，表明氢气共进料是实验设置的一部分。这表明氢气共进料是PDH过程中的标准做法。

2. 进料中氢气的存在可能会影响反应平衡，并在一定程度上抑制焦炭形成，但具体影响并未明确说明。

3. 在这项研究中，催化剂稳定性似乎更多地受到颗粒大小而非氢气共进料的影响。较小的Pt颗粒（3 nm）显示出较高的初始活性，但由于结焦而更快失活，而较大的颗粒（21 nm）更稳定，对丙烯生产的选择性更高。

4. 反应机理似乎涉及C-C键和C-H键活化之间的平衡。氢气共进料可能会影响这种平衡，可能有利于C-H键活化（脱氢）而非C-C键断裂（裂解）。

5. 焦炭形成似乎选择性地使负责C-C键活化的位点失活，这实际上提高了对所需丙烯产物的选择性。氢气共进料可能会调节这种效应，但给定的文献中并未详细说明具体影响。

总的来说，虽然研究没有直接回答这个问题，但它表明氢气共进料是PDH过程中的一个重要参数，可能会影响反应平衡、焦炭形成和选择性。然而，其他因素如催化剂粒径也在决定过程效率和性能方面起着关键作用。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is cofed in the reaction mixture, which suggests it plays a role in the process. 

The study focuses more on the effects of platinum particle size rather than hydrogen cofeeding. It notes that smaller Pt particles are more active for C-C bond activation (cracking reactions), while larger Pt particles are more selective for C-H bond activation (dehydrogenation reactions). This implies that hydrogen cofeeding might influence the balance between these reaction pathways.

The document also mentions that coke formation can actually improve selectivity by deactivating sites responsible for C-C bond activation. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which typically reduces coke formation, might have complex effects on overall process efficiency and performance.

To fully answer the question, more specific research on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed, particularly regarding its impacts on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的全面信息。然而，它确实提到反应混合物中共进料了氢气，这表明氢气在该过程中发挥了作用。

该研究更多地关注铂粒子尺寸的影响，而不是氢气共进料的影响。研究指出，较小的Pt粒子对C-C键活化(裂解反应)更活跃，而较大的Pt粒子对C-H键活化(脱氢反应)更具选择性。这意味着氢气共进料可能会影响这些反应途径之间的平衡。

文献还提到，积碳形成实际上可以通过使负责C-C键活化的位点失活来提高选择性。这表明氢气共进料(通常会减少积碳形成)可能对整体过程效率和性能产生复杂的影响。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对PDH中的氢气共进料进行更具体的研究，特别是关于其对能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化的影响。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made based on the available information:

The study used a feed containing 13 vol.% H2 along with 8 vol.% C3H8 in helium for the PDH reaction. This indicates that hydrogen was cofed during the process. The catalysts were also pretreated in flowing H2 before the experiments.

The research focused on the effect of Pt particle size rather than hydrogen cofeeding. It was observed that catalysts with smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher activity but lower selectivity compared to those with larger particles (21 nm). Importantly, the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the total amount of coke formed were significantly higher on the catalyst with smaller particles.

While the study does not directly address the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it does highlight the importance of particle size in determining catalyst performance and coking behavior. This suggests that the effects of hydrogen cofeeding might also vary depending on the catalyst's particle size distribution.

To fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on process efficiency and performance in PDH, further research specifically focused on this aspect would be needed.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的问题。然而，根据可用信息可以得出一些相关观察：

研究使用的进料中含有13体积%的H2和8体积%的C3H8（氦气作为平衡气）用于PDH反应。这表明在过程中确实有氢气共进料。实验前，催化剂也在流动的H2中进行了预处理。

研究的重点是Pt粒子尺寸的影响，而不是氢气共进料的影响。观察发现，具有较小Pt粒子(3 nm)的催化剂显示出更高的活性但较低的选择性，相比于具有较大粒子(21 nm)的催化剂。重要的是，在小颗粒催化剂上，焦炭形成速率、焦炭形成选择性和形成的焦炭总量都明显更高。

虽然研究没有直接讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响，但它确实强调了粒子尺寸在决定催化剂性能和焦炭行为方面的重要性。这表明氢气共进料的影响可能也会因催化剂的粒子尺寸分布而有所不同。

要充分理解氢气共进料对PDH过程效率和性能的影响，需要进行专门针对这一方面的进一步研究。

[2] "Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles. However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%) (Fig. 2b)."

[3] "The initial rate of coking is an order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher (0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study only mentions using a feed with 13 vol.% H2, but does not compare this to conditions without hydrogen cofeeding.

However, the study does provide some insights into coke formation and catalyst performance based on Pt particle size. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher initial propane conversion but lower propene selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm). The smaller particles also exhibited much higher rates of coking and selectivity to coke formation.

These findings suggest that Pt particle size significantly influences reaction pathways and coke formation in PDH. While not directly addressing hydrogen cofeeding effects, this information implies that catalyst design and operating conditions play crucial roles in balancing activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH processes.

The study does not discuss energy barriers, acid site conversions, or graphitization in relation to hydrogen cofeeding or coke formation. To fully answer the question, additional research specifically focused on hydrogen cofeeding effects in PDH would be needed.

然而，该研究确实基于Pt粒子尺寸提供了一些关于积碳形成和催化剂性能的见解。较小的Pt粒子(3 nm)表现出更高的初始丙烷转化率，但与较大粒子(21 nm)相比，丙烯选择性较低。较小的粒子还表现出更高的积碳速率和积碳形成选择性。

这些发现表明，Pt粒子尺寸显著影响PDH中的反应途径和积碳形成。虽然没有直接讨论氢气共进料的影响，但这些信息暗示催化剂设计和操作条件在平衡PDH过程中的活性、选择性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。

该研究没有讨论与氢气共进料或积碳形成相关的能量障碍、酸性位转化或石墨化。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行专门针对PDH中氢气共进料影响的额外研究。
