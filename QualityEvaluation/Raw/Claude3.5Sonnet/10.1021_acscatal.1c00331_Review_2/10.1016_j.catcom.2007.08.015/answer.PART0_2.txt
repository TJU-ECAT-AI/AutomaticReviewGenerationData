[1] "The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8 and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total flow of 150 ml/min."

[2] "Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11], namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11], namely dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does mention that hydrogen is cofed in the reaction mixture, which suggests it plays a role in the process. 

The study focuses more on the effects of platinum particle size rather than hydrogen cofeeding. It notes that smaller Pt particles are more active for C-C bond activation (cracking reactions), while larger Pt particles are more selective for C-H bond activation (dehydrogenation reactions). This implies that hydrogen cofeeding might influence the balance between these reaction pathways.

The document also mentions that coke formation can actually improve selectivity by deactivating sites responsible for C-C bond activation. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding, which typically reduces coke formation, might have complex effects on overall process efficiency and performance.

To fully answer the question, more specific research on hydrogen cofeeding in PDH would be needed, particularly regarding its impacts on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, and graphitization.

该文献并未提供关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的全面信息。然而，它确实提到反应混合物中共进料了氢气，这表明氢气在该过程中发挥了作用。

该研究更多地关注铂粒子尺寸的影响，而不是氢气共进料的影响。研究指出，较小的Pt粒子对C-C键活化(裂解反应)更活跃，而较大的Pt粒子对C-H键活化(脱氢反应)更具选择性。这意味着氢气共进料可能会影响这些反应途径之间的平衡。

文献还提到，积碳形成实际上可以通过使负责C-C键活化的位点失活来提高选择性。这表明氢气共进料(通常会减少积碳形成)可能对整体过程效率和性能产生复杂的影响。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对PDH中的氢气共进料进行更具体的研究，特别是关于其对能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位点转化和石墨化的影响。
