[1] "The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8 and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total flow of 150 ml/min."

[2] "Initial C3H8 conversion values correspond to the analysis of reaction products after 5 min on stream."

[3] "These results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11], namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11], namely dehydrogenation reactions."

[4] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

The literature does not directly address the specific effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some inferences can be made based on the information provided:

1. The study used a feed containing 13 vol.% H2, indicating that hydrogen cofeeding was part of the experimental setup. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding is a standard practice in PDH processes.

2. The presence of hydrogen in the feed likely affects the reaction equilibrium and may help suppress coke formation to some extent, though the exact impact is not explicitly stated.

3. Catalyst stability appears to be influenced more by particle size than hydrogen cofeeding in this study. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher initial activity but faster deactivation due to coking, while larger particles (21 nm) were more stable and selective towards propylene production.

4. The reaction mechanism seems to involve a balance between C-C and C-H bond activation. Hydrogen cofeeding may influence this balance, potentially favoring C-H bond activation (dehydrogenation) over C-C bond breaking (cracking).

5. Coke formation appears to selectively deactivate sites responsible for C-C bond activation, which actually improves selectivity towards the desired propylene product. Hydrogen cofeeding might modulate this effect, but the specific impact is not detailed in the given literature.

Overall, while the study does not directly address the question, it suggests that hydrogen cofeeding is an important parameter in PDH processes, likely influencing reaction equilibrium, coke formation, and selectivity. However, other factors such as catalyst particle size also play crucial roles in determining process efficiency and performance.

该文献没有直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的具体影响。然而，根据所提供的信息可以进行一些推断：

1. 研究使用的进料中含有13体积%的H2，表明氢气共进料是实验设置的一部分。这表明氢气共进料是PDH过程中的标准做法。

2. 进料中氢气的存在可能会影响反应平衡，并在一定程度上抑制焦炭形成，但具体影响并未明确说明。

3. 在这项研究中，催化剂稳定性似乎更多地受到颗粒大小而非氢气共进料的影响。较小的Pt颗粒（3 nm）显示出较高的初始活性，但由于结焦而更快失活，而较大的颗粒（21 nm）更稳定，对丙烯生产的选择性更高。

4. 反应机理似乎涉及C-C键和C-H键活化之间的平衡。氢气共进料可能会影响这种平衡，可能有利于C-H键活化（脱氢）而非C-C键断裂（裂解）。

5. 焦炭形成似乎选择性地使负责C-C键活化的位点失活，这实际上提高了对所需丙烯产物的选择性。氢气共进料可能会调节这种效应，但给定的文献中并未详细说明具体影响。

总的来说，虽然研究没有直接回答这个问题，但它表明氢气共进料是PDH过程中的一个重要参数，可能会影响反应平衡、焦炭形成和选择性。然而，其他因素如催化剂粒径也在决定过程效率和性能方面起着关键作用。
