[1] "The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8 and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total flow of 150 ml/min."

[2] "Prior to the experiments the catalysts were pretreated in flowing H2 (20 ml/min) at 793 K for 4 h."

[3] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the effects of hydrogen cofeeding on coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, some relevant observations can be made based on the available information:

The study used a feed containing 13 vol.% H2 along with 8 vol.% C3H8 in helium for the PDH reaction. This indicates that hydrogen was cofed during the process. The catalysts were also pretreated in flowing H2 before the experiments.

The research focused on the effect of Pt particle size rather than hydrogen cofeeding. It was observed that catalysts with smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher activity but lower selectivity compared to those with larger particles (21 nm). Importantly, the rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation, and the total amount of coke formed were significantly higher on the catalyst with smaller particles.

While the study does not directly address the impact of hydrogen cofeeding on energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, or graphitization, it does highlight the importance of particle size in determining catalyst performance and coking behavior. This suggests that the effects of hydrogen cofeeding might also vary depending on the catalyst's particle size distribution.

To fully understand the implications of hydrogen cofeeding on process efficiency and performance in PDH, further research specifically focused on this aspect would be needed.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中焦炭形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理影响的问题。然而，根据可用信息可以得出一些相关观察：

研究使用的进料中含有13体积%的H2和8体积%的C3H8（氦气作为平衡气）用于PDH反应。这表明在过程中确实有氢气共进料。实验前，催化剂也在流动的H2中进行了预处理。

研究的重点是Pt粒子尺寸的影响，而不是氢气共进料的影响。观察发现，具有较小Pt粒子(3 nm)的催化剂显示出更高的活性但较低的选择性，相比于具有较大粒子(21 nm)的催化剂。重要的是，在小颗粒催化剂上，焦炭形成速率、焦炭形成选择性和形成的焦炭总量都明显更高。

虽然研究没有直接讨论氢气共进料对能量障碍、焦炭积累模式、酸性位转化或石墨化的影响，但它确实强调了粒子尺寸在决定催化剂性能和焦炭行为方面的重要性。这表明氢气共进料的影响可能也会因催化剂的粒子尺寸分布而有所不同。

要充分理解氢气共进料对PDH过程效率和性能的影响，需要进行专门针对这一方面的进一步研究。
