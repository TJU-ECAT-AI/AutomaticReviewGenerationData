[1] "The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8 and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total flow of 150 ml/min."

[2] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about how hydrogen cofeeding affects coke formation, catalyst stability, and reaction mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The study only mentions that hydrogen was included in the feed gas, but does not compare this to runs without hydrogen or discuss its specific effects. 

Based on the limited information provided, we can infer that hydrogen cofeeding was used in this PDH process, likely to help suppress coke formation. However, the study focuses more on the effects of platinum particle size rather than the role of hydrogen. It shows that smaller Pt particles (3 nm) led to higher rates of coking and more coke formation compared to larger particles (21 nm), despite the presence of hydrogen in the feed. This suggests that hydrogen cofeeding alone may not be sufficient to prevent coking, especially with very small catalyst particles that are highly active but less selective.

The study does not discuss energy barriers, coke accumulation patterns, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency in relation to hydrogen cofeeding. To fully answer the question, additional research specifically focused on the effects of hydrogen in PDH would be needed.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答氢气共进料如何影响丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中的积碳形成、催化剂稳定性和反应机理的问题。该研究仅提到进料气中包含氢气,但没有与不含氢气的运行进行比较或讨论其具体影响。

根据所提供的有限信息,我们可以推断该PDH过程使用了氢气共进料,可能是为了帮助抑制积碳形成。然而,该研究更多地关注铂粒子尺寸的影响,而不是氢气的作用。研究表明,尽管进料中存在氢气,较小的Pt粒子(3 nm)与较大的粒子(21 nm)相比,导致更高的积碳速率和更多的积碳形成。这表明,仅靠氢气共进料可能不足以防止积碳,特别是在使用活性很高但选择性较低的极小催化剂粒子时。

该研究没有讨论与氢气共进料相关的能量障碍、积碳累积模式、酸性位转化、石墨化或整体过程效率。要全面回答这个问题,需要进行专门针对氢气在PDH中的影响的额外研究。
