[1] "Introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate"

[3] "Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al. and Yang et al. have proved that the presence of surface hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects several aspects:

1. Coke formation: It lowers the coking rate, improving catalyst stability.

2. Reaction mechanisms: Surface hydrogen shifts the third C-H cleavage step to a higher energy, making alkene desorption more favorable. This improves propene selectivity but elevates activation energies.

3. Overall process efficiency: While it enhances selectivity and reduces coking, hydrogen cofeeding decreases equilibrium conversion and increases compression energy consumption in downstream separation processes.

4. Catalyst stability: The lower coking rate contributes to improved catalyst stability over time.

5. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen elevates activation energies for dehydrogenation steps.

These effects have mixed implications for process performance. While selectivity and catalyst stability are improved, the decreased conversion and increased energy requirements may offset these benefits. The optimal use of hydrogen cofeeding likely involves balancing these competing factors to maximize overall process efficiency.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中影响了几个方面：

1. 积碳形成：它降低了积碳速率，提高了催化剂稳定性。

2. 反应机理：表面氢原子将第三个C-H键断裂步骤推向更高能量，使烯烃脱附更有利。这提高了丙烯选择性，但也提高了活化能。

3. 整体过程效率：虽然它提高了选择性并减少了积碳，但氢气共进料降低了平衡转化率，并增加了下游分离过程中的压缩能耗。

4. 催化剂稳定性：较低的积碳速率有助于提高催化剂的长期稳定性。

5. 能量障碍：氢气的存在提高了脱氢步骤的活化能。

这些效应对过程性能有着复杂的影响。虽然选择性和催化剂稳定性得到了改善，但转化率的降低和能源需求的增加可能会抵消这些优势。氢气共进料的最佳使用可能涉及平衡这些相互竞争的因素，以最大化整体过程效率。
