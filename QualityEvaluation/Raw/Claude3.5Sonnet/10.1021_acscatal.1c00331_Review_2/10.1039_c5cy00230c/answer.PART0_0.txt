[1] "For PDH over Pt catalyst, Chen et al57. found the reaction order to hydrogen is -0.5, which indicates that lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage will lead to the increase of the reaction rate."

[2] "When steam is introduced, the removal of cokes will help recover and maintain these highly active Pt sites and increase the catalysts activity and decrease the selectivity to propene at the same time."

[3] "Another advantages of steam for PDH is that steam could contribute to lower coking rate25,58,59, which is justified by our TG analysis of the spent catalysts, as shown in Table 4."

The literature does not directly address hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does discuss some effects of hydrogen and steam on the PDH process:

1. Hydrogen has a negative reaction order (-0.5) for PDH over Pt catalysts. Lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage increase the reaction rate.

2. Steam helps remove coke deposits and maintain active Pt sites. This increases catalyst activity but decreases propene selectivity.

3. Steam lowers the coking rate, as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis of spent catalysts.

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about hydrogen's impacts on PDH mechanisms and performance.

文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)的影响。但是,它确实讨论了氢气和蒸汽对PDH过程的一些影响:

1. 氢气对铂催化剂上的PDH反应级数为负值(-0.5)。较低的氢分压和表面覆盖率会提高反应速率。

2. 蒸汽有助于去除积碳并维持活性铂位点。这增加了催化剂活性,但降低了丙烯选择性。

3. 蒸汽降低了积碳速率,这一点通过对失活催化剂的热重分析得到了证实。

该文献并未提供氢气共进料如何具体影响能垒、酸位转化、石墨化或整体工艺效率的信息。要全面回答有关氢气对PDH机理和性能影响的问题,还需要进行更多研究。
