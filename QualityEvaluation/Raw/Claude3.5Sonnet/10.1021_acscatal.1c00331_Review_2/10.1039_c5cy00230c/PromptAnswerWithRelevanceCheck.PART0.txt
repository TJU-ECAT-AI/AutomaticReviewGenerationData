[1] "For PDH over Pt catalyst, Chen et al57. found the reaction order to hydrogen is -0.5, which indicates that lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage will lead to the increase of the reaction rate."

[2] "When steam is introduced, the removal of cokes will help recover and maintain these highly active Pt sites and increase the catalysts activity and decrease the selectivity to propene at the same time."

[3] "Another advantages of steam for PDH is that steam could contribute to lower coking rate25,58,59, which is justified by our TG analysis of the spent catalysts, as shown in Table 4."

The literature does not directly address hydrogen cofeeding in propane dehydrogenation. However, it does discuss some effects of hydrogen and steam on the PDH process:

1. Hydrogen has a negative reaction order (-0.5) for PDH over Pt catalysts. Lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage increase the reaction rate.

2. Steam helps remove coke deposits and maintain active Pt sites. This increases catalyst activity but decreases propene selectivity.

3. Steam lowers the coking rate, as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis of spent catalysts.

The document does not provide information on how hydrogen cofeeding specifically affects energy barriers, acid site conversions, graphitization, or overall process efficiency. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about hydrogen's impacts on PDH mechanisms and performance.

文献并未直接讨论氢气共进料对丙烷脱氢(PDH)的影响。但是,它确实讨论了氢气和蒸汽对PDH过程的一些影响:

1. 氢气对铂催化剂上的PDH反应级数为负值(-0.5)。较低的氢分压和表面覆盖率会提高反应速率。

2. 蒸汽有助于去除积碳并维持活性铂位点。这增加了催化剂活性,但降低了丙烯选择性。

3. 蒸汽降低了积碳速率,这一点通过对失活催化剂的热重分析得到了证实。

该文献并未提供氢气共进料如何具体影响能垒、酸位转化、石墨化或整体工艺效率的信息。要全面回答有关氢气对PDH机理和性能影响的问题,还需要进行更多研究。

[1] "For the purpose of taking the best advantage of those merits of steam, several terms should be addressed. For one thing, platinum-based catalysts used in steam atmosphere need to be designed carefully to avoid the sintering of Pt particles27,28."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate15-17."

[3] "Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al.20 and Yang et al.21 have proved that the presence of surface hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies."

[4] "However, introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects several aspects:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding leads to lower coking rates, which helps maintain catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability. However, care must be taken in catalyst design to avoid sintering of Pt particles in steam atmospheres.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of surface hydrogen atoms shifts the third C-H cleavage step to a higher energy, making it less competitive with alkene desorption. This improves dehydrogenation selectivity but elevates activation energies.

4. Energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding increases activation energies for certain steps in the reaction mechanism.

5. Selectivity: Higher propene selectivity is observed with hydrogen cofeeding.

However, hydrogen cofeeding has some drawbacks:

1. It decreases equilibrium conversion of propane.
2. It increases compression energy consumption for downstream separation processes.

These effects have implications for overall process efficiency and performance. While hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability and selectivity, it comes at the cost of lower conversion and increased energy requirements. The trade-offs between these factors must be carefully considered when optimizing the PDH process.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中影响了几个方面：

1. 积碳形成：氢气共进料导致较低的积碳速率，有助于保持催化剂的稳定性。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料提高了催化剂的稳定性。然而，在蒸汽氛围中设计催化剂时必须注意避免Pt颗粒的烧结。

3. 反应机理：表面氢原子的存在使第三个C-H键断裂步骤转移到更高的能量，使其与烯烃脱附步骤的竞争性降低。这提高了脱氢选择性，但提高了活化能。

4. 能量障碍：氢气共进料增加了反应机理中某些步骤的活化能。

5. 选择性：观察到氢气共进料时丙烯选择性更高。

然而，氢气共进料也有一些缺点：

1. 它降低了丙烷的平衡转化率。
2. 它增加了下游分离过程的压缩能耗。

这些影响对整体过程效率和性能有影响。虽然氢气共进料提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，但它以降低转化率和增加能源需求为代价。在优化PDH过程时，必须仔细考虑这些因素之间的权衡。

[1] "It's well known that catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over some metal oxide catalysts follows Mars-van Krevelen mechanism45-49 and Eley-Rideal mechanism50-53, for the later pathways, the surface oxygen species are involved in activating and abstracting H from propane."

[2] "In industrial practice, co-feed of hydrogen7,15-18 or steam19 with propane is used to enhance the performance of platinum-based catalysts. The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate15-17."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the PDH process affects several aspects:

1. Coke formation: It lowers the coking rate, improving catalyst stability.

2. Reaction mechanisms: Surface hydrogen shifts the third C-H cleavage step to a higher energy, making alkene desorption more favorable. This improves propene selectivity but elevates activation energies.

3. Overall process efficiency: While it enhances selectivity and reduces coking, hydrogen cofeeding decreases equilibrium conversion and increases compression energy consumption in downstream separation processes.

4. Catalyst stability: The lower coking rate contributes to improved catalyst stability over time.

5. Energy barriers: The presence of hydrogen elevates activation energies for dehydrogenation steps.

These effects have mixed implications for process performance. While selectivity and catalyst stability are improved, the decreased conversion and increased energy requirements may offset these benefits. The optimal use of hydrogen cofeeding likely involves balancing these competing factors to maximize overall process efficiency.

The implications for overall process efficiency and performance are mixed. While hydrogen cofeeding improves selectivity and reduces coking, potentially extending catalyst life, it also increases energy barriers and reduces conversion. The optimal balance would depend on specific process conditions and economic factors. The impact on acid site conversions and graphitization patterns is not directly addressed in the given literature.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中有几个影响：

1. 它有助于提高丙烯选择性和降低结焦率，改善催化剂稳定性。

2. 它使第三个C-H键断裂步骤的能量值升高，使其与烯烃脱附步骤的竞争性降低。这改善了脱氢选择性，但提高了活化能。

3. 由于氢气的反应级数为-0.5，较低的氢分压和表面覆盖率会导致反应速率增加。

4. 从工程角度来看，氢气共进料是不利的，因为它会降低平衡转化率并增加分离过程的压缩能耗。

对整体过程效率和性能的影响是复杂的。虽然氢气共进料改善了选择性并减少了结焦，可能延长了催化剂寿命，但它也增加了能量障碍并降低了转化率。最佳平衡将取决于具体的工艺条件和经济因素。文献中没有直接提到对酸性位点转化和石墨化模式的影响。
