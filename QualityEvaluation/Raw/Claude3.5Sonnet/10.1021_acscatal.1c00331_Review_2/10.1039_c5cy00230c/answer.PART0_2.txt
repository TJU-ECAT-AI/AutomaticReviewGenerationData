[1] "It's well known that catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over some metal oxide catalysts follows Mars-van Krevelen mechanism45-49 and Eley-Rideal mechanism50-53, for the later pathways, the surface oxygen species are involved in activating and abstracting H from propane."

[2] "In industrial practice, co-feed of hydrogen7,15-18 or steam19 with propane is used to enhance the performance of platinum-based catalysts. The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate15-17."

[3] "Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al.20 and Yang et al.21 have proved that the presence of surface hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies."

[4] "However, introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects several aspects:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding leads to lower coking rates, which helps maintain catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding enhances catalyst stability and longevity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of surface hydrogen atoms shifts the third C-H cleavage step to a higher energy value. This makes it less competitive compared to the preferred alkene desorption step.

4. Energy barriers: While improving selectivity, hydrogen cofeeding elevates activation energies for certain steps in the reaction.

5. Selectivity: Hydrogen cofeeding contributes to higher propene selectivity by making the deep dehydrogenation steps less favorable.

6. Process efficiency: From an engineering perspective, hydrogen cofeeding has some drawbacks. It decreases equilibrium conversion and increases compression energy consumption for subsequent separation processes.

Overall, hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability and selectivity at the cost of some process efficiency. The trade-off between these factors needs to be carefully considered when optimizing PDH processes.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中影响了几个方面：

1. 积碳形成：氢气共进料导致较低的积碳速率，有助于保持催化剂稳定性。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料提高了催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

3. 反应机理：表面氢原子的存在使第三个C-H键断裂步骤的能量值升高。这使得它与优先的烯烃脱附步骤相比竞争力降低。

4. 能量障碍：虽然提高了选择性，但氢气共进料提高了反应某些步骤的活化能。

5. 选择性：通过使深度脱氢步骤不易发生，氢气共进料提高了丙烯的选择性。

6. 过程效率：从工程角度来看，氢气共进料有一些缺点。它降低了平衡转化率，并增加了后续分离过程的压缩能耗。

总的来说，氢气共进料以牺牲一些过程效率为代价，提高了催化剂稳定性和选择性。在优化PDH过程时，需要仔细考虑这些因素之间的权衡。
