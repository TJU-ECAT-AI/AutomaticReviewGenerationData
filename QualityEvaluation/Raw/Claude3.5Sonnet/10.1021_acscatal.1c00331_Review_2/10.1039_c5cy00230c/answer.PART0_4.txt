[1] "Introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate"

[3] "Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al. and Yang et al. have proved that the presence of surface hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies."

[4] "For PDH over Pt catalyst, Chen et al. found the reaction order to hydrogen is -0.5, which indicates that lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage will lead to the increase of the reaction rate."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has several effects:

1. It contributes to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate, improving catalyst stability.

2. It shifts the third C-H cleavage step to a higher energy value, making it less competitive with alkene desorption. This improves dehydrogenation selectivity but elevates activation energies.

3. Lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage lead to increased reaction rates, as the reaction order to hydrogen is -0.5.

4. From an engineering perspective, hydrogen cofeeding is unfavorable as it decreases equilibrium conversion and increases compression energy consumption for separation.

The implications for overall process efficiency and performance are mixed. While hydrogen cofeeding improves selectivity and reduces coking, potentially extending catalyst life, it also increases energy barriers and reduces conversion. The optimal balance would depend on specific process conditions and economic factors. The impact on acid site conversions and graphitization patterns is not directly addressed in the given literature.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中有几个影响：

1. 它有助于提高丙烯选择性和降低结焦率，改善催化剂稳定性。

2. 它使第三个C-H键断裂步骤的能量值升高，使其与烯烃脱附步骤的竞争性降低。这改善了脱氢选择性，但提高了活化能。

3. 由于氢气的反应级数为-0.5，较低的氢分压和表面覆盖率会导致反应速率增加。

4. 从工程角度来看，氢气共进料是不利的，因为它会降低平衡转化率并增加分离过程的压缩能耗。

对整体过程效率和性能的影响是复杂的。虽然氢气共进料改善了选择性并减少了结焦，可能延长了催化剂寿命，但它也增加了能量障碍并降低了转化率。最佳平衡将取决于具体的工艺条件和经济因素。文献中没有直接提到对酸性位点转化和石墨化模式的影响。
