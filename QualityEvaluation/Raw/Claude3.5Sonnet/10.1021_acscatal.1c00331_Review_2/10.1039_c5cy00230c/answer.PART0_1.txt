[1] "For the purpose of taking the best advantage of those merits of steam, several terms should be addressed. For one thing, platinum-based catalysts used in steam atmosphere need to be designed carefully to avoid the sintering of Pt particles27,28."

[2] "The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rate15-17."

[3] "Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al.20 and Yang et al.21 have proved that the presence of surface hydrogen atom can shift the third C-H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive to the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improve the dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies."

[4] "However, introducing hydrogen in the PDH process seem to be unfavorable from engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process."

Hydrogen cofeeding in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process affects several aspects:

1. Coke formation: Hydrogen cofeeding leads to lower coking rates, which helps maintain catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst stability: By reducing coke formation, hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability. However, care must be taken in catalyst design to avoid sintering of Pt particles in steam atmospheres.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The presence of surface hydrogen atoms shifts the third C-H cleavage step to a higher energy, making it less competitive with alkene desorption. This improves dehydrogenation selectivity but elevates activation energies.

4. Energy barriers: Hydrogen cofeeding increases activation energies for certain steps in the reaction mechanism.

5. Selectivity: Higher propene selectivity is observed with hydrogen cofeeding.

However, hydrogen cofeeding has some drawbacks:

1. It decreases equilibrium conversion of propane.
2. It increases compression energy consumption for downstream separation processes.

These effects have implications for overall process efficiency and performance. While hydrogen cofeeding improves catalyst stability and selectivity, it comes at the cost of lower conversion and increased energy requirements. The trade-offs between these factors must be carefully considered when optimizing the PDH process.

氢气共进料在丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中影响了几个方面：

1. 积碳形成：氢气共进料导致较低的积碳速率，有助于保持催化剂的稳定性。

2. 催化剂稳定性：通过减少积碳形成，氢气共进料提高了催化剂的稳定性。然而，在蒸汽氛围中设计催化剂时必须注意避免Pt颗粒的烧结。

3. 反应机理：表面氢原子的存在使第三个C-H键断裂步骤转移到更高的能量，使其与烯烃脱附步骤的竞争性降低。这提高了脱氢选择性，但提高了活化能。

4. 能量障碍：氢气共进料增加了反应机理中某些步骤的活化能。

5. 选择性：观察到氢气共进料时丙烯选择性更高。

然而，氢气共进料也有一些缺点：

1. 它降低了丙烷的平衡转化率。
2. 它增加了下游分离过程的压缩能耗。

这些影响对整体过程效率和性能有影响。虽然氢气共进料提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，但它以降低转化率和增加能源需求为代价。在优化PDH过程时，必须仔细考虑这些因素之间的权衡。
