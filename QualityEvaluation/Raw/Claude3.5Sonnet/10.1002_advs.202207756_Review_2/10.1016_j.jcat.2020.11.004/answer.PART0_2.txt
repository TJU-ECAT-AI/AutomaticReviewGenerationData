[1] "Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 is found to depend on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[2] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."

[3] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites, which provides the first direct experimental evidence of inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species."

[4] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, significantly challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The study reveals that Ga speciation depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, leading to the formation of different types of Ga species within the zeolite structure. 

Specifically, in samples with low Si/Al ratios, Ga+ preferentially forms Ga+H+ pair sites, while in samples with high Si/Al ratios, mainly isolated Ga+ species are produced. This inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species is further evidenced by the observation that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not on isolated Ga+ sites.

The non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance can be attributed to these different Ga species having distinct properties and potentially different catalytic activities in PDH reactions. This challenges the notion of a single type of active site and suggests that the optimal catalyst performance may depend on achieving the right balance of different Ga species.

These findings have significant implications for understanding the true nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. They suggest that the catalytic activity is not simply a function of the total Ga content, but rather depends on the specific distribution and nature of Ga species within the zeolite structure. This understanding is crucial for optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, as it implies that both the Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite support need to be carefully controlled to achieve the desired distribution of active sites for optimal PDH performance.

H-ZSM-5沸石中孔内Ga物种结构和分布的变化性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，严重挑战了PDH活性均一性的假设。研究表明，Ga的形态取决于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比，导致在沸石结构中形成不同类型的Ga物种。

具体来说，在低Si/Al比的样品中，Ga+优先形成Ga+H+配对位点，而在高Si/Al比的样品中，主要产生孤立的Ga+物种。这种交换Ga物种的不均匀性进一步由Ga氢化物只能在Ga+H+配对位点上形成，而不能在孤立的Ga+位点上形成的观察结果所证实。

Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系可以归因于这些不同的Ga物种具有不同的性质，并可能在PDH反应中具有不同的催化活性。这挑战了单一类型活性位点的概念，并表明最佳催化剂性能可能取决于实现不同Ga物种之间的适当平衡。

这些发现对理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性位点的真实性质具有重要意义。它们表明，催化活性不仅仅是总Ga含量的函数，而是取决于沸石结构中Ga物种的特定分布和性质。这种理解对于优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂至关重要，因为它意味着需要仔细控制Ga负载量和沸石载体的Si/Al比，以实现所需的活性位点分布，从而获得最佳的PDH性能。
