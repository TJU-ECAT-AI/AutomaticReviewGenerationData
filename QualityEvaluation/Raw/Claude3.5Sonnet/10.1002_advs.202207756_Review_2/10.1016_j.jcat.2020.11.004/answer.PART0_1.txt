[1] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[2] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[3] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites, which provides the first direct experimental evidence of inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species."

[4] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, significantly challenges the assumption of uniform PDH activity. The study reveals that Ga speciation varies with Brønsted acid site (BAS) density, which is directly related to the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite. At low Si/Al ratios, paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, forming Ga+H+ pair sites, while at high Si/Al ratios, isolated Ga+ species are predominantly formed.

This heterogeneity in Ga speciation has important implications for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The study provides direct experimental evidence of the inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species, showing that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, not on isolated Ga+ sites. Furthermore, these two types of Ga species exhibit drastically different properties in their reactions with H2 and water, suggesting they could have different catalytic properties in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction.

The non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance can be attributed to the changing distribution of these different Ga species as Ga loading increases. At low Ga loadings, the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites may dominate, leading to an initial increase in catalytic activity. As Ga loading increases further, the formation of isolated Ga+ species or even Ga oligomers may become more prevalent, potentially leading to a plateau or decline in catalytic performance.

These findings highlight the complexity of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst system and underscore the importance of considering the heterogeneity of Ga species when optimizing catalyst performance. Future research should focus on understanding the specific catalytic roles of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species in the PDH reaction, and on developing strategies to control the distribution of these species to maximize catalytic activity and selectivity.

H-ZSM-5沸石中孔内Ga物种结构和分布的变化性，受Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，显著挑战了PDH活性均一性的假设。研究表明，Ga的形态随着Brønsted酸位点（BAS）密度的变化而变化，而BAS密度直接与沸石的Si/Al比相关。在低Si/Al比时，成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换，形成Ga+H+配对位点，而在高Si/Al比时，则主要形成孤立的Ga+物种。

Ga形态的这种异质性对理解活性位点的真实性质和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂具有重要意义。该研究为交换Ga物种的不均一性提供了直接的实验证据，表明Ga氢化物只能在Ga+H+配对位点上形成，而不能在孤立的Ga+位点上形成。此外，这两种类型的Ga物种在与H2和水的反应中表现出截然不同的性质，暗示它们在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中可能具有不同的催化性能。

Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系可归因于随着Ga负载量增加，这些不同Ga物种分布的变化。在低Ga负载量时，Ga+H+配对位点的形成可能占主导地位，导致催化活性初步增加。随着Ga负载量进一步增加，孤立Ga+物种或甚至Ga寡聚体的形成可能变得更加普遍，可能导致催化性能趋于平稳或下降。

这些发现强调了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂体系的复杂性，并突出了在优化催化剂性能时考虑Ga物种异质性的重要性。未来的研究应该集中在理解Ga+H+配对位点和孤立Ga+物种在PDH反应中的具体催化作用，以及开发控制这些物种分布的策略，以最大化催化活性和选择性。
