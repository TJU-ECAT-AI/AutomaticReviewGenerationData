H-ZSM-5 supported Ga (Ga/H-ZSM-5) has long been recognized as a promising catalyst for nonoxidative
dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes. However, Ga speciation under reaction condi-
tions remains controversial. In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spec-
troscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios
(15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7). Quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine
reveals that one Ga atom roughly replaces one Brnsted acid site (BAS) at Ga/BAS ratio up to 0.7, however,
only up to 80% of the BAS on the H-ZSM-5 can be exchanged even with excess amounts of Ga. At a low
Si/Al ratio of 15, the intensity of GaHx bands on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 at 550 C increases almost linearly
at low Ga loadings (Ga/Al < 0.13), and then levels off. In contrast, no detectable GaHx bands are observed
on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio of 39, with Ga/Al ratios up to 1.3. The dependence of GaHx bands
on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo-
lite. We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation
of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species. Using water as a probe
molecule, we show that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, i.e., the former can be
easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the latter is inactive under the same con-
ditions. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on
reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane
dehydrogenation reactions.

1. Introduction
Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infras-
tructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chem-
icals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and
cymene [1]. Propylene is currently obtained as a by-product from
naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units
in refineries [2]. However, there has been a growing gap between
the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase
in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock [3]. Propane dehy-
drogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to produc-
ing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with
a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based cat-
alyst, have been commercialized [4,5]. The high cost of Pt and the
health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incen-
tivized development of other PDH catalysts [4], such as Ga- [612],
Zn- [13], Co- [1416], V-based [17] and ZrO2 [1820] catalysts.
Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient
catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of
alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity
of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH
reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of
research [911,2123].
Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-
ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-
temperature-programmed
desorption
(NH3-TPD)
have
been
employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the
active site in the PDH reaction [911,24]. Typically, Ga is intro-
duced to H-ZSM-5 via impregnation and followed by calcination
forming Ga2O3 crystallites supported on the external surface of
H-ZSM-5. Upon reduction in the presence of H2 above 500 C,
Ga3+ species are believed to be reduced and diffuse into the micro-
pores of the zeolite [25], displacing protons of Brnsted acid sites
(BAS) [2628]. A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga
(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form
after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental
and
computational
techniques
[911,24,2628].

X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main
species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the
utilized reducing gas [24,29], which is consistent with a more
recent report by Schreiber et al. [10] Alternative interpretations
of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction
conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not suffi-
ciently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl
or hydride species [11,30]. Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first
identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/
H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spec-
troscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an
active role in the PDH. However, they collected spectra at room
temperature after reducing samples with H2 at 500 C, and the
state of the catalyst at room temperature after cooling may not
be representative of the catalyst state at 500 C. Recently, Phadke
et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers
for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent
of Ga/Al ratio. This was supported by FTIR spectroscopic and
NH3-TPD results, along with thermodynamic stability analysis
[11]. FTIR and NH3-TPD experiments in these studies were con-
ducted on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in its oxidized state [11], where the Ga spe-
ciation could be quite different from that of the reduced sample.
Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were
more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst
based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions,
and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and iso-
lated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in
recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [9
11,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indi-
rect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental character-
izations and computational investigations.
In this work, we employ in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy
to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples
with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al
ratio (01.7). Quantitative correlations between the consumption
of the BAS and the Ga loading are obtained by determining the
BAS density after reduction using pyridine as a probe molecule.
Ga hydride species are characterized at the temperature close to
that of typical PDH conditions, revealing the inhomogeneity of
Ga species exchanged with BAS after reduction. These observations
offer direct experimental evidence for the presence of Ga+H+ pair
sites and isolated Ga+ species. This conclusion is further supported
by FTIR investigations using water as a probe molecule; these show
that isolated Ga+ sites on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples can be
quickly oxidized by water at 150 C while Ga+H+ pair sites cannot.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
H-ZSM-5 samples were prepared by calcining commercial NH4-
ZSM-5 samples (Zeolyst, CBV 3024E, CBV 5524G and CBV 8014) at
550 C for 8 h in flowing air with a ramp rate of 2 C min1. The Si/
Al ratios of the samples were determined to be 15.4  1.3,
27.5  1.9 and 39.0  2.8 by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Ga/H-ZSM-
5 samples with varying Ga/Al ratios (0.0141.70) were prepared
via the incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution
of gallium(III) nitrate hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by drying
at 80 C for 6 h and calcination at 600 C for 2 h in flowing air with
a ramp rate of 5 C min1. Ga/MFI (8 wt% Ga) was prepared by the
same method with siliceous MFI prepared according to a previous
report [31]. Ga2O3 was obtained by calcination of gallium(III)
nitrate hydrate at 600 C in flowing air for 2 h with a ramp rate
of 5 C min1.
2.2. Transmission Fourier Transformed Infrared studies
In-situ Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectra were col-
lected on an Agilent CARY 660 spectrometer equipped with an
MCT detector and a custom in-situ transmission cell. In general,
the signal was collected at 128 scans per spectrum at a spectral
resolution of 2 cm1. Vacuum levels of <0.01 mTorr were achieved
through connection to a vacuum manifold equipped with a
mechanical pump and a diffusion pump. The transmission cell
was heated by heating tapes controlled by a PID controller. Catalyst
were pressed into self-supporting wafers of about 20 mg, which
were then loaded into a custom-made sample holder for vertical
alignment in the infrared beam. The samples were dehydrated at
550 C for 30 min under vacuum before all experiments. Chemicals
such as H2, H2O, D2O and pyridine were introduced to the trans-
mission cell with their pressures controlled via the vacuum
manifold.
Pyridine adsorption was conducted to quantify the amount of
BAS and Lewis acid sites (LAS) [10]. The self-supporting wafer
was dehydrated at 550 C, followed by a H2 (1 atm) treatment at
the same temperature. H2 was introduced to the cell three times
for 10 min each to ensure that the catalyst was fully reduced.
The sample was then cooled down to 150 C under vacuum, fol-
lowed by the introduction of 100 mTorr of pyridine and evacua-
tion. This dosing procedure was repeated until intensity of the
bands corresponding to adsorbed pyridinium increased by < 1%
between doses before spectrum was collected. Concentrations of
BAS were determined by integrating the area of the band corre-
sponding to protonated pyridine (1540 cm1) and using the extinc-
tion coefficient determined in our recent work [32,33]. All infrared
spectra with different Ga/Al ratios were normalized to the intensity
of SiOSi framework overtone bands [11] between 1700 and
2000 cm1. The relative consumption of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 sam-
ples after reduction compared to the support H-ZSM-5 was calcu-
lated using the equation (1).

Water treatment of the reduced samples was conducted to
investigate different properties of two Ga species. In general, the
self-supporting sample was reduced at 550 C and cooled down
to 150 C under dynamic vacuum, followed by the introduction
of 1000 mTorr of water vapor repeatedly until the intensity of
the bands at 20302070 cm1 increased by < 1% between doses.
The peak area of this peak was integrated and normalized to the
intensity of SiOSi framework overtone bands [11] between
1700 and 2000 cm1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5
Although there is a general understanding of the reduction pro-
cess of Ga/H-ZSM-5 in H2 prior to the introduction of propane in
the PDH, much of this information has been inferred from ex-situ
characterizations. The Ga3+ species in Ga2O3 crystallites supported
on the external surface of H-ZSM-5 crystals of Ga/H-ZSM-5 are
believed to be reduced and mobilized in the presence of H2 above
500 C to diffuse into the micropores of the zeolite [25] and dis-
place protons of BAS [2628]. However, several key aspects of
how this activation process in the PDH occurs, e.g., the depen-
dence of Ga speciation on the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite and the
Ga/Al ratio of the catalyst, remain topics of considerable discussion
[911,21]. To address these questions, in-situ transmission FTIR
spectroscopy is employed to investigate the Ga speciation in Ga/

H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide
range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7). Composition and textural properties of
the three H-ZSM-5 samples are summarized in Table S1, showing
that these samples are pure and are highly crystalline. The BAS
densities of the samples were 636, 460, 281 lmol/g for samples
with Si/Al ratios of 15, 28 and 39, respectively, by quantitative
transmission
FTIR
with
pyridine
as
the
probe
molecule
(Table S1). These values are consistent with previous reports of
H-ZSM-5 samples with comparable Si/Al ratios [34,35]. The mea-
sured BAS densities are lower than those determined from Si/Al
ratios of zeolites, which is likely due to the presence of small
amounts of extraframework Al. This is consistent with a weak fea-
ture at 0 ppm in 27Al solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-
NMR) spectra (Fig. S1), corresponding to octahedrally coordinated
extraframework Al (AlEF). Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with varying Ga
loadings were prepared by impregnation followed by calcination,
and the Ga loadings were determined by XRF (Table S2).
In-situ FTIR investigations of the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 con-
firm the replacement of BAS with Ga species. After dehydration
under vacuum at 550 C, the FTIR spectrum of the dehydrated
Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15 and Ga/Al = 1.0) shows three peaks cen-
tered at 3735 cm1, 3645 cm1, 3591 cm1 (Fig. 1(i)), which are
assigned to the external silanol group (Si-OH), AlEF-OH and
bridge-OH group associated with BAS, respectively [11]. The bands
for these O-H stretching modes generally blueshift and become
more intense as temperature decreases (Fig. S2). At lower temper-
atures, a band at 3780 cm1, attributable to AlEF-OH, becomes bet-
ter defined. The presence of bands at both 3645 cm1 and
3780 cm1 is consistent with the detection of octahedral-Al species
by 27Al SS-NMR. Upon reduction with H2 (1 atm) at 550 C, the BAS
band (3591 cm1) disappears (Fig. 1(ii)), indicating the replace-
ment of BAS by Ga species [27,28,36]. Interestingly, the band at
3735 cm1 increases in intensity upon reduction (Fig. 1(iii)), which
could be interpreted as the result of external silanol groups formed
after Ga species initially located at the external surface migrate
into the zeolitic micropores in the H2 atmosphere. These observa-
tions at reaction temperature and atmosphere are in line with
literature [27,28,36,37]. FTIR spectra were collected on Ga/H-
ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) in the Ga/Al range of 01.7 at 550 C before
and after reduction with H2 (Fig. 2a). Without Ga (Ga/Al = 0), spec-
tra collected before and after the reduction procedure overlap
completely (Fig. 2a(i), black and red traces, respectively), as
expected. As the Ga/Al ratio increases to 0.56, the fraction of the
BAS band which remains after reduction decreases, indicating a
larger fraction of BAS is replaced by Ga species. At Ga/Al ratios at
or above 0.7, the BAS band completely disappears after reduction.
Similar observations were made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios
of 28 and 39 (Fig. 2b and c), except that the Ga/Al ratio above
which no visible BAS band exist after reduction was found to be
1.0.
It is important to contrast the conditions at which spectra in
Fig. 2 were collected with those in previous reports to understand
the discrepancies. Hensen and coworkers reported the disappear-
ance of the BAS IR band after reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 2
024, Ga/Al = 1) [28], and also detected the formation of Ga-OH
(3665 cm1). This Ga-OH band is absent in this work after reduc-
tion, likely due to different experimental procedures. Hensen and
coworkers collected IR spectra at room temperature after reduc-
tion; the inevitable exposure of the reduced sample to trace
amount of water vapor during the cooling period, even under
dynamic evacuation, could lead to the oxidation of the reduced
Ga species to form Ga-OH. This possibility is eliminated in this
study by collecting spectra at 550 C directly following the reduc-
tion procedure. This hypothesis is supported by a control experi-
ment in which the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15 and Ga/
Al = 1.0) is intentionally exposed to water vapor at 550 C leading
to the evolution of the Ga-OH band and the reappearance of the
BAS band (Fig. S3(i-iv)). Phadke et al. [11] recently reported that
the BAS band did not disappear on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with Ga/Al ratios
up to 0.7; this is likely due to the fact that spectra were collected
in an oxidizing environment (flowing air at 500 C). To verify this
hypothesis, dry air is introduced to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/
Al = 15 and Ga/Al = 1.0) at 550 C, leading to the appearance of
Ga-OH and BAS bands (Fig. S3(v, vi)). These control experiments
show that not only reduced Ga species are susceptible to oxidation
by both air and water, but also that in-situ characterization is vital
to capture the dynamic process of catalyst reduction.
Quantitative FTIR experiments with pyridine show that not all
BAS can be exchanged by Ga species even at Ga/Al ratios up to
1.7 during the reduction treatment. Although results in Fig. 2
unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of the replacement of
BAS with Ga species during the reduction treatment, it could be
deceiving when used as the basis for quantitative analysis. This is
because the BAS OH band of zeolite samples is easily obscured
by the background at low densities [38]. To determine the density
of the BAS left on Ga/H-ZSM-5 after reduction, pyridine was intro-
duced to reduced samples at 150 C. Cooling from 550 C to 150 C
in vacuum takes 30 min, as compared to 1.5 h to the room tem-
perature, in the absence of active cooling. The absence of the BAS
and the Ga-OH bands on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/
Al > 0.7) after cooling to 150 C indicates that exposure of the
reduced sample to the trace mount of water vapor under vacuum,
if occurred at all, was minimal (Fig. S4). Quantitative analysis of
FTIR spectra of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with pyridine provides insight
into the stoichiometry of the replacement process. Upon dosing
pyridine
on
H-ZSM-5
(Si/Al
=
15),
three
peaks
appear
at
1540 cm1, 1455 cm1, and 1490 cm1 (Fig. 3a), attributable to
protonated pyridinium ion (BAS), coordinatively adsorbed pyridine
on the LAS, and a combination of pyridine adsorbed on BAS and
LAS, respectively [10]. As expected, the BAS band at 3605 cm1 dis-
appears upon pyridine introduction (data not shown).
As the Ga/Al ratio of the sample with a Si/Al ratio of 15 increases
from 0 to 1.7, several interesting trends emerge. The integrated

area of the pyridinium band decreases by 75% as the Ga/Al ratio
increases from 0 to 0.7 (Fig. 3a(i-xii)), and then levels off at 80%
at higher Ga/Al ratios (Fig. 3a(xiii-xv)). It is important to note that
the BAS cannot be completely replaced by the Ga species even at a
Ga/Al ratio of 1.7, which is different from the conclusions reached
in the literature [11]. Conducting the pyridine experiments on
reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples without air or water exposure is
key to obtaining reliable BAS densities on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5,
as BAS can reappear upon catalyst re-oxidation (Fig. S3(v)). Thus,
ex-situ methods such as NH3-TPD are unlikely to produce results
relevant to reduced catalysts [11] unless proper catalyst pretreat-
ment is included. A slope of nearly one is observed between per-
centage of consumed BAS band and the Ga/BAS ratio up to the
Ga/BAS ratio of 0.7 (Fig. 4), corresponding to one Ga atom replacing
one BAS. This is likely due to abundance of BAS relative to Ga at
lower Ga/BAS ratios, and is consistent with a previous report
[10]. In contrast, Phadke et al. reported the same ratio as close to
2 [11]; this discrepancy is likely caused by the different BAS quan-
tification method employed as discussed above. The consumption
of BAS increases with Ga/Al ratio and reached about 70% for sam-
ples with Ga/Al ratios near unity. This slope increasingly deviates
from unity as the Ga/BAS ratio exceeds 0.7, and largely levels off
at Ga/BAS ratios above 1.5. This trend could be attributed to the
difficulty for Ga species to find the increasingly scarce BAS. Similar
trends are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with higher Si/Al ratios (28
and 39). The Ga/BAS ratio beyond which the slope deviates from
unity occurs at 0.5 for Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 28), and the Ga/BAS
starts at 0.4 for samples with a Si/Al ratio of 39. This could be
in part because for samples with higher Si/Al ratios (lower Al den-
sities), it is more difficult for Ga to encounter BAS to react with.
These observations agree with previous XANES results showing
the formation of GaOx oligomers at Ga/Al > 0.3 [11]. The highest
percentage of BAS consumption in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/
Al ratios is similar (80%), suggesting a thermodynamic barrier
rather than a purely diffusional one to achieve complete BAS
replacement. One possible explanation is the formation of Ga oli-
gomers in the zeolite micropores which become more energetically
favorable than exchanging with the rest of BAS, as suggested by
Bell and coworkers [11].
Ga speciation of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is also found to depend
on the Ga/Al ratio. When pyridine was introduced to the reduced
Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), the band corresponding to pyridine
adsorbed on the LAS (1455 cm1) increases in intensity with
increasing Ga/Al ratio. This could be attributed to pyridine
adsorbed on the Ga+ species. A shoulder at 1446 cm1 appears at
a Ga/Al ratio of 0.45 and grows as the Ga loading rises. There is
no significant increase of this LAS peak as the Ga/Al ratio increases
from 0.7 to 1.7 for both bands at 1455 cm1 and 1446 cm1
(Fig. S6). The leveling off the integrated area of the band corre-
sponding to pyridine on Ga+ (1455 cm1) is expected as few addi-
tional BAS are replaced by Ga+ when the Ga/Al ratio is above 0.7
(Fig. 3a). The near constant magnitude of the intensity of the
1446 cm1 band with Ga loading at high Ga/Al ratios suggests that
it is unlikely to correspond to pyridine adsorbed on unreduced
Ga2O3, as there is an increasing fraction of Ga not exchanged with
BAS as the Ga/Al ratio increases. The lack of the band at 1446 cm1
upon introduction of pyridine on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/
Al = 1.0) without reduction (Fig. S7(ii)), on which the majority of
Ga is expected to exist in the form of Ga2O3, supports this conclu-
sion. Thus, the 1446 cm1 band could be attributed to a reduced
form of gallium oxide. Bell and coworkers proposed the formation
of GaOx oligomers at Ga/Al ratio higher than 0.3 [11]. Control
experiment of pyridine adsorbed on Ga2O3 reduced by H2 at
550 C shows a band centered at 1451 cm1 (Fig. S7), which is
likely a convoluted band corresponding to pyridine adsorbed on
a mixture of unreduced and partially reduced Ga sites. Similar
observations have been made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at Si/Al ratios of 28
and 39 (Fig. 3b and c).
3.2. Gallium hydride species
The dependence of the formation and relative abundance of the
gallium hydride species formed upon reduction on the Ga/Al ratios
and Si/Al ratios provides another dimension to differentiate differ-
ent Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first
identified Ga monohydride (GaH, 2059 cm1) and Ga dihydride
(GaH2, 2041 cm1) after reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 using DRIFTS.
The spectra collected by Hensen and coworkers were obtained at
room temperature after reducing the sample with H2 at 500 C,
and the observed spectral features for Ga hydrides could be differ-
ent from those at reaction temperatures. Regardless, this is an
important discovery, as the ability of Ga species to form hydrides
could be used to gauge their homogeneity (or the lack thereof).
In-situ FTIR spectroscopy is employed to monitor the formation
of Ga hydride species at 550 C on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples
with multiple Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios. After reducing the Ga/
H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with different Ga/Al ratios with H2 (1 atm)
at 550 C, bands corresponding to GaH and GaH2 (at 2053 cm1
and 2037 cm1, respectively) appeared after the cell was evacuated
at the same temperature (Fig. 5a) [2628]. The bands for these Ga-
H stretching modes generally blueshift as Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15,
Ga/Al = 1) cools down under vacuum (Fig. S8), which explains the
slight shifts of the hydride bands reported in this work compared
to those by Hensen and coworkers [27,28]. In addition, the hydride
bands become more intense when the sample temperature
decreases (Fig. S8), with the invisible GaH band at 550 C appearing
as a relatively well-defined peak at 150 C [28]. Since the sample
was cooled relatively quickly under dynamic vacuum (30 min),
the GaHx density is expected to remain unchanged. The increase
in the peak area is likely due to the thermally driven dynamic nat-
ure of the GaHx species at high temperatures, which weakens and
broadens the vibrational bands. Following this logic, the GaH struc-
ture appears more dynamic than GaH2, unless there is a tempera-
ture dependent interconversion of these two species. As expected,
no Ga hydride is observed on H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) without Ga
(Fig. 5a(i)). The GaH2 band is barely detectable at a Ga/Al ratio of
0.014 (Fig. 5a(ii)), but becomes better defined as the Ga/Al ratio

rises. The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga
loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines
slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56 (Fig. 5a). A
discernable GaH band does not appear until the Ga/Al ratio exceeds
0.08, and disappears at Ga/Al ratios above 0.7. The combined peak
area of Ga hydrides as a function of the Ga/Al ratio is plotted in
Fig. 6; this combined area is dominated by the GaH2 band, due to
its higher intensity. Pyridine FTIR spectra show that consumption
of the BAS by Ga exchange upon reduction does not stop until
the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.7 (Fig. 3a and 4). These diverging trends
for the Ga hydride formation and the BAS consumption indicate
that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of form-
ing Ga hydrides upon reduction. This is clear evidence of the
heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga species, in addition to the those
remaining on the external surface of zeolite crystals (especially at
higher Ga loadings) [11]. We note that GaHx bands are more
intense in H2 atmospheres than under vacuum (Fig. S9), which is
likely due to a dynamic equilibrium between hydrided and non-
hydrided Ga species, which favors hydrides at high partial pressure
of H2. The integrated GaHx band area decreases by 4060% within
30 min (Fig. S10) upon evacuation. All spectra of reduced sample
under vacuum were collected 30 s after evacuation. The intensity
of Ga hydride bands decreases with the increase of the Si/Al ratio
of H-ZSM-5 at the same Ga/Al ratio (Fig. 5b and c), which could
be, in part, attributed to lower the absolute Ga weight loadings.
It should be noted that the integrated area of the GaHx band is a
factor of 5.7 lower on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 28, Ga/Al = 0.15) than
that on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.083) even at similar Ga
weight loadings (0.6 wt%), suggesting the Ga loading is not the
sole parameter in determining the band intensity. Further, no
detectable
spectral
feature
is
observed
on
Ga/H-ZSM-5
(Si/
Al = 39) with the Ga/Al ratio up to 1.3 (Ga wt% up to 3.68%). Con-
sidering that at the same Ga/Al ratio, the Ga content in Ga/H-ZSM-
5 (Si/Al = 39) is less than Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), then it is neces-
sary to compare the amount of GaHx formed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with
the comparable Ga loading. At a Ga/Al ratio of 0.12, the Ga loading
in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) is higher than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/
Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.042). The former shows no spectral feature for
GaHx species (Fig. 5c(ii)), while the latter shows a clear GaH2 band
(Fig. 5a(iv)). More strikingly, Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39, Ga/Al = 1) has
a comparable Ga weight loading to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/
Al = 0.45), on which the intensity of GaHx bands is close to maxi-
mum (Fig. 6). Similar arguments could be made regarding the

amount of exchanged Ga with the BAS, i.e., comparable amounts of
exchanged Ga (Ga/BAS  0.07 in Fig. 4) lead to well-defined GaHx
bands on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) but no detectable spectral signa-
ture on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39). Thus, the ability to form GaHx
species after H2 treatment at 550 C is only present on Al-rich zeo-
lites (with lower Si/Al ratios). This provides the first direct experi-
mental evidence that the speciation of exchanged Ga in reduced
Ga/H-ZSM-5 is dependent on the Al density in the zeolite.
The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could
be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga
species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e.,
Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS (Scheme 1). Isolated
and paired BAS are loosely defined as BAS without and with a
neighboring BAS to interact with, respectively. We acknowledge
that this definition is less specific than those proposed by recent
investigations [911,21], but would argue that such flexibility/am-
biguity is justified based on the heterogeneity of the exchanged Ga
species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples. The dependence of the
GaHx formation on the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite (Fig. 5), i.e., the
BAS density, suggests that the environment of BAS has an impact
on the properties of the exchanged Ga species, as has also been
concluded in recent reports [11,39,40]. Zeolites with lower Si/Al
ratios, or higher Al contents, have higher densities of paired BAS
assuming Al is distributed uniformly across the zeolite framework.
This is generally a valid assumption except for special cases with
uneven distributions of Al in the zeolite framework [41,42]. On a
sample with a high Si/Al ratio, e.g., 39 in this work, the majority
of the BAS are isolated. Thus Ga+ species that replace the protons
via ion-exchange should also be isolated and lack interaction with
neighboring BAS. The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-
5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that
these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C
(under vacuum or in the H2 atmosphere). Meanwhile, at lower Si/
Al ratios, e.g., Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), there is a higher probability
of BAS to occur as paired BAS sites. We propose that the Ga+H+
pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS
is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spec-
troscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b). This hypothesis agrees with
the charge balance requirement that two adjacent BAS are needed
for GaH (Scheme 1) assuming a +3 valence for the Ga cation. For
samples with both isolated and paired protons, paired protons
are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites,
as GaHx bands are observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at low
Ga loadings.
3.3. Water as a probe molecule for Ga hydride species
Water interacts extensively with Ga+ and GaHx species leading
to distinct spectral features, and thus is an excellent probe mole-
cule of Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. Several reports have
mentioned that reduced Ga+ is sensitive to trace amounts of water
[26,27], leading to its oxidation. Introducing water vapor to
reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 550 C leads to
the appearance of bands at 3591 and 3662 cm1 (Fig. S11), attribu-
table to recovered BAS and Ga(OH)x, respectively [26]. This sug-
gests that water is able to oxidize Ga+ at this condition to reform
BAS and Ga(OH)x (Scheme 2). Thus, maintaining a high level of vac-
uum and reducing the time between H2 treatment and spectral col-
lection are important in FTIR measurements to minimize the
undesired impact of water. Meanwhile, this sensitivity also makes
water a suitable probe molecule to characterize Ga species on
reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5.
IR spectra collected after introducing water vapor to reduced
Ga/H-ZSM-5 provide further evidence of the heterogeneity of
exchanged Ga species. Ga/H-ZSM-5 after H2 treatment at 550 C
is

cooled
down
to
150
C
under
vacuum
(within
30 min). A control experiment confirms negligible impact of the
trace amount of water in the evacuated cell on the spectra based
on the absence of the Ga(OH)x band at 3672 cm1 at 150 C
(Fig. S12). Upon water introduction to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5
(Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 C, an intense band centered at
2052 cm1 appears (red trace of Fig. 7a(ix)), completely masking
the GaHx bands in the same spectral range. Although this band is
located in close proximity to the GaHx bands, they are unlikely to
be of a similar origin; as it would be quite unlikely for water to fur-
ther reduce Ga species on samples that had been already reduced
with H2 at 550 C (and produce O2 based on stoichiometry). It
has been proposed that reduced Ga+ can react with water to form
GaOOH [26,27], and bands at 20652092 cm1 and 1946
2038 cm1 could be attributed to the Ga-OH bending mode of
GaOOH [4347]. Introduction of water to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-
5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 1.0) at 150 C leads to the production of H2,
in agreement with water acting as an oxidant (Fig. S13). Based
on literature precedents and the water introduction reaction
results, we assign the band at 2052 cm1 to GaOOH. Interestingly,
introduction of water to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) with lower Ga/Al
ratios (0.13) has a much less pronounced impact than those
observed on samples with higher Ga/Al ratios (Fig. 7a(i-iv)). In par-
ticular, the GaH band on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.042)

barely changes after water introduction (black and red traces of
Fig. 7a(i)). These observations suggest that the Ga species is differ-
ent at low Ga/Al ratios (0.13) and high Ga loadings, supporting
our hypothesis of two distinct exchanged Ga species. Importantly,
the threshold Ga/Al ratio (0.13) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at
which this transition occurs coincides with the point at which
the combined GaHx band area levels off as Ga loading increases
(Fig. 6), indicating that the same change in Ga speciation is likely
responsible for changes in the trends of both GaHx and GaOOH
bands. It follows that GaHx species formed after treating Ga+H+
pair with H2 at 550 C (Ga/Al ratio  0.13) do not react with water
to form GaOOH at 150 C, and only isolated Ga+ species are oxi-
dized. Although no detectable GaHx band is observed on Ga/H-
ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) after reduction at 550 C (Fig. 5c), GaHx bands
appear after the sample is cooled to 150 C under vacuum (black
traces of Fig. 7b), which is similar to that on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/
Al = 15), as shown in black traces of Fig. 7a. In line with this obser-
vation, for the lowest Ga/Al ratio investigated (0.12) on Ga/H-ZSM-
5 (Si/Al = 39), water introduction hardly has an effect on the spec-
tra (Fig. 7b(i)). The GaOOH band after water introduction grows
with the Ga/Al ratio on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39), which is consis-
tent with results on samples with a lower Si/Al ratio of 15 (Fig. 7).
Isotopic labeling experiments verify that GaHx species do not
react with water at 150 C. The hypothesis that the exchanged
Ga species exist in two distinct environments (isolated and paired
with a neighboring proton), together with the spectral features
observed upon water introduction (Figs. 7 and 8), lead to the pre-
diction that water does not react with GaHx at 150 C. The intense
band corresponding to GaOOH in most cases overwhelms the GaHx
features, preventing the unambiguous identification of GaHx bands
after water introduction. H-D exchange experiments were con-
ducted to probe the reactivity of GaHx with water. The FTIR spectra
of the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39, Ga/Al = 1) at 150 C shows a
positive and a negative peaks at 3740 and 3605 cm1(Fig. 9a(i)),
which can be attributed to the partial restoration of external sila-
nol groups and consumed BAS upon reduction and Ga exchange
with BAS, respectively, as discussed previously (Fig. 1). Weak but
distinct GaH2 and GaH band centered at 2040 and 2060 cm1,
respectively, are also present (Fig. 9b(i)). Upon introduction of
H2O (1000 mTorr), a board band spanning 20402060 cm1
appears, corresponding to the formation of GaOOH (Fig. 9b(ii)).
The broad width of this band makes it difficult to discern whether
GaHx bands remain. D2O is subsequently introduced (1000 mTorr),
leading to the appearance of the SiO-D bands at 26002800 cm1
via the H-D exchange. The broad band at 20402060 cm1 largely
disappears (Fig. 9b(iii)) while a similarly broad band at 1476 cm1
appears (Fig. 9c(iii)), attributable to GaOOD due to the H-D
exchange. This assignment is supported by the ratio (1.39)
between the wavenumbers of the two bands, which is similar to
that between SiOH and SiOD (1.36). Importantly, the band at
2060 cm1 (and to a lesser degree the 2040 cm1 band) remains

after the introduction of excess of D2O (Fig. 9b(iii)), indicating the
presence of GaHx. This results confirms the prediction that GaHx
does not react with water at 150 C; proposed based on the lack
of change of GaHx bands upon water introduction for samples with
low Ga/Al ratios (Fig. 7a(i) and b(i)). Reintroduction of H2O in
excess is able to largely replace the SiOD and GaOOD bands with
SiOH and GaOOH bands, respectively (Fig. 9(iv)).
Additional spectroscopic investigations confirm that Ga+H+
pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at
150 C, further confirming that these two Ga species possess dis-
tinct properties. To avoid the complication of having both Ga+H+
pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites, Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15, Ga/
Al = 0.042) is used to investigate the ability of Ga+H+ pair to react
with water, as we have shown that this sample has a negligible
concentration of isolated Ga+ sites (Fig. 7a(i)). Two independent
sets of experiments were conducted in which the Ga/H-ZSM-5
(Si/Al = 15, Ga/Al = 0.042), after H2 treatment at 550 C, was either
directly cooled to 150 C under vacuum or cooled to 150 C after
undergoing 30 min of annealing at 600 C under vacuum. Based
on the observed slow decomposition of GaHx species at 550 C in
vacuum (Fig. S10), annealing at 600 C is expected to more effec-
tively convert GaHx species to Ga+H+ pair sites. This is confirmed
by the much weaker GaHx bands on the annealed sample than
those of the sample without annealing (Fig. 10a(iii) and a(i),
respectively), as shown in schematically in Fig. 10b. Thus, a signif-
icant fraction of Ga+ species in the sample after annealing are pre-

sent in the form of Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than GaHx. No detect-
able change is observed upon water introduction to both samples
at 150 C, indicating that the Ga+H+ pair is unreactive with water
under this condition (Fig. 10a(ii) and a(iv), and Fig. 10b). This is in
stark contrast with the isolated Ga+ species, which readily form
GaOOH when exposed to water at 150 C. This result then verifies
that the reactivity of isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair species are quite
different. The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair and
isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon exposure to H2 at 550 C
and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could
have different catalytic properties in the PDH, which will the sub-
ject of study in a future work.
4. Conclusions
Detailed in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopic investigations
of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39)
and a wide range of Ga/Al ratio (01.7) show that Ga speciation
depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios. Upon reduction with H2
at 550 C, Ga species initially located on the external surface
migrate into the zeolitic micropores of H-ZSM-5 and exchange
with BAS to form Ga+. Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single
protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form
Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated
Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a
high Si/Al ratio. A one-to-one correspondence in the consumption
of BAS and Ga loading is found in samples with low Si/Al and Ga/Al
ratios by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine, however,
exchange with BAS becomes increasingly difficult at higher Ga
loadings due to the scarcity of BAS. Up to 80% of BAS are con-
sumed at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7, suggesting complete removal
of BAS cannot be achieved with excess Ga. Spectral features of
GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show
that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than
isolated Ga+ sites, which provides the first direct experimental evi-
dence of inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species. This is supported
by spectral observations with water as a probe molecule, in which
only isolated Ga+ can be oxidized by water at 150 C to form
GaOOH, while Ga+H+ pair sites, regardless of the existence of
GaHx species, do not react with water. The drastically different
properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-
ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C
strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different cat-
alytic properties in the PDH.
