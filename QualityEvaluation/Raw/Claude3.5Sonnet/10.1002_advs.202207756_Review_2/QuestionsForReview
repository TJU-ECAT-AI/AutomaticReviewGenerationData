How does the variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenge the assumption of uniform PDH activity, and what implications does the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance have for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts?
