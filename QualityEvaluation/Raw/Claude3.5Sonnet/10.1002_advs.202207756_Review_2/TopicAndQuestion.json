    "QuestionEnglish": "How does the variability in intraporous Ga species structure and distribution in H-ZSM-5 zeolites, influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Si/Al ratio, challenge the assumption of uniform PDH activity, and what implications does the observed non-monotonic relationship between Ga/Al ratio and catalytic performance have for understanding the true nature of active sites and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts?",
    "QuestionChinese": "H-ZSM-5沸石中孔内Ga物种的结构和分布的变化性如何受到Ga负载量和Si/Al比等因素的影响，从而挑战了均匀PDH活性的假设，而观察到的Ga/Al比与催化性能之间的非单调关系对理解活性位点的真实性质和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂有何启示？"
