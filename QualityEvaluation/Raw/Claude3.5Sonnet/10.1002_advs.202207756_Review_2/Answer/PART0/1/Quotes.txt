[1] "Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite. We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[2] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[3] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites, which provides the first direct experimental evidence of inhomogeneity of exchanged Ga species."

[4] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

[5] "Up to 80% of BAS are consumed at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7, suggesting complete removal of BAS cannot be achieved with excess Ga."

[1] "A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH."

[2] "Lercher and co-workers[77] were the first to examine the impact of the Ga/Al ratio on Ga speciation and PDH rates: they observed that the rate increased as Ga/Al ratio rises from 0 to 0.5, before declining with further addition of Ga (Figure 5a)."

[3] "The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely."

[4] "To gain a more thorough picture of Ga speciation, it is important to systematically investigate Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different densities of framework Al pairs and Ga loadings. In general, lower Si/Al ratios are expected to lead to higher densities of framework Al pairs in zeolites."

[5] "Ga normalized PDH rates showed a decreasing catalytic rate with the increase of Ga loading (Figure 6i), indicating the highly active Ga species were introduced at low Ga loading, and a higher Ga loading led to the formation of less active or inactive Ga species."

[1] "Two types of Ga species, namely highly dispersed oxides and cationic Ga species, were determined by 71Ga QCPMG NMR."

[2] "According to the quantitative analysis of Ga species obtained by the simulation of the 71Ga QCPMG spectra (Table1), the relative content of cationic Ga species (190ppm) on Ga/ZSM-5-redox is much higher compared to those on Ga/ZSM-5-ox, being 48.7% vs. 35.1%."

[3] "Different Ga species formed in the channel of zeolite would impact catalyst activity for CH activation of light alkanes."

[4] "The much higher activity of Ga/ZSM-5-redox reflected by the formation of high concentration of Ga-CH3 species indicates that the Ga ions such as GaO+ promotes methane activation."

[5] "The observation of different Ga-CH3 suggests four pathways (a-d) dependent on the local environments of the active Ga species."
