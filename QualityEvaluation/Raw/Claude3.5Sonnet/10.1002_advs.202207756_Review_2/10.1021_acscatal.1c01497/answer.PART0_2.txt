Unfortunately, I do not have enough relevant information from the given literature excerpt to provide meaningful quotes or answers to the question. The literature snippet only contains the title, authors, and publication details of a scientific article, without any substantive content about Ga speciation, propane dehydrogenation activity, or catalysts. Without access to the full text of the article, I cannot extract relevant quotes or provide an informed answer to the detailed question about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
