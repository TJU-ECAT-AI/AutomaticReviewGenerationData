2.1.2 Impact of Al Distribution in H-ZSM-5 on the Ga Speciation
A frequent implicit assumption of the reports discussed above is that all intraporous Ga species have a similar structure and PDH activity; thus, the characterization results obtained reflected the properties of all active Ga species in PDH. Since PDH activity increases significantly (more than one order of magnitude) when Ga is introduced to H-ZSM-5, the intraporous Ga species is presumed to be the main active site. However, this assumption implies that the TOF should be independent of Ga loading and the Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM-5 support, as long as most Ga enters into the zeolite and sufficient BAS are present: these predictions turned out to be wide off the mark.
Impact of the Ga/Al Ratio on the Ga Speciation
Lercher and co-workers[77] were the first to examine the impact of the Ga/Al ratio on Ga speciation and PDH rates: they observed that the rate increased as Ga/Al ratio rises from 0 to 0.5, before declining with further addition of Ga (Figure 5a). A similar trend was observed for the propane cracking reaction (C3H8  CH4 + C2H4), indicating that both PDH and cracking occur on the same active site (a similar trend was later reported by Yuan et al.).[55] The non-monotonic trend of the PDH rate with increasing Ga loading suggested that a single type of active Ga species dominating PDH activity over the entire range of Ga/Al ratio was unlikely. If there were only one type of active Ga species for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5, then the density of this species was expected to increase with Ga loading until the thermodynamic driving force for additional Ga to enter the zeolite was exhausted, which would lead to leveling off, rather than falling of PDH activity. Importantly, Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different Ga loadings were determined quantitatively. A 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS was determined at Ga/Al ratios below 0.5, a result confirmed later by Yuan et al.[110]
It was also found that at Ga/Al ratios above 0.5, Lewis acidic GaxOy species started to appear (Figure 5b). In this report,[77] H2-pulsed temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was applied to quantitatively determine the amounts of H2O formed and H2 consumed during the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 5c). Comparison of the measured H2/H2O ratio of 2/3 with the stoichiometry of potential reactions points to Ga+ as the dominant Ga species formed upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 5d). To reconcile with the observed TOF trends at different Ga/Al ratios, a LewisBrnsted acid pair site (Ga+H+ pair) was proposed as a highly active species in PDH based primarily on the results of DFT calculations (Figure 5e). A synergistic effect between neighboring Ga+ and H+ sites was envisioned, leading to the optimal PDH activity at an equal density of the two types of sites. The proximity of Ga+ and H+ in the proposed mechanism suggested that the Ga+H+ pair was only present when two framework Al atoms were located close to each other. This was the first time that the distribution of framework Al atoms in zeolites was considered, if not explicitly, as a relevant variable in PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5. Deng and co-workers also confirmed the synergy between BAS and Ga cations species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites in the methanol-to-aromatics reaction.[123] Solid state NMR spectroscopy has been employed to provide evidence for the migration of Ga species into zeolites pores, and importantly, to estimate the distances of BAS pairs and Ga-H pairs through 1H1H SQ-DQ and 1H71Ga S-RESPDOR, respectively.[123-125] It should be noted that the measured Ga/H-ZSM-5 is in the oxidized, rather than reduced, form.
Bell and co-workers recognized the importance of the framework Al distribution in PDH more explicitly.[76, 100] Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H+ with GaCl3 at 205 C, followed by H2 reduction at 550 C to remove Cl ligands. The resulting material was then oxidized by O2 at 500 C for further characterization. Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (under oxidizing conditions at 450 C) showed that the intensity of the BAS OH group (3593 cm1) decreased monotonically as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, a result of the replacement of BAS by Ga3+ species (Figure 6a). The appearance of an IR band at 3660 cm1 was assigned to the Ga-OH band. The integration of the band at (3593 cm1) was used for the quantification of BAS consumption as a function of Ga/Al ratios (Figure 6b). At Ga/Al ratio below 0.3, each Ga3+ replaces approximately two Brnsted acid OH groups, consistent with the formation of divalent [Ga(OH)]2+ cations. For Ga/Al ratios higher than 0.3, the BAS was not exchanged further, a result assigned to the formation of GaOx oligomers that do not occupy cation-exchanged sites. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were conducted to further probe the exchange between Ga3+ sites and BAS on oxidized Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 6c,d). The NH3 desorption peak at 387 C was attributed to the desorption of NH3 interacting with BAS OH groups, and the integrated peak area used to estimate the concentration of BAS in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
For Ga/Al ratios below 0.3, NH3-TPD results showed that each Ga3+ site titrated approximately one BAS (Figure 6d), which is inconsistent with the analysis of infrared spectra (Figure 6a,b). The authors proposed the presence of two types of Ga sites associated with paired framework Al atoms: i) [GaOH]2+ exchanged with two protons that were next-nearest neighbors (NNN), and ii) [Ga(OH)2]+ exchanged with a proton with another proton as the next-next-nearest neighbor (NNNN), as in Figure 6e. NNN and NNNN were calculated to be the paired Al framework atoms with a different distance between the two Al atoms (less than 5 Å and more than 5Å, respectively). The different conclusions drawn from infrared spectroscopy and NH3-TPD were reconciled based on the different detection mechanisms of the two techniques. [GaOH]2+ exchanged with NNN exhibited the same exchange stoichiometry in both techniques that one Ga atom replaces two BAS sites. In [Ga(OH)2]+H+ the OH stretching mode of the BAS was shifted from 3610 to 2436 cm1 due to the H-bonding with the neighboring Ga-OH group, leading to the apparent exchange stoichiometry of one Ga atom for two BAS based on the FTIR. Meanwhile, the BAS in [Ga(OH)2]+H+ could still be detected by NH3-TPD. Subsequent reduction of [GaOH]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+H+ led to the formation of [HGaOH]+H+, and then [GaH]2+ and [GaH2]+H+, respectively (Figure 6e).
Thermodynamic phase analysis (Figure 6f,g) showed that the Ga3+ structure was dependent on both H2 pressure and temperature: the Ga-OH group in both [GaOH]2+ and [Ga(OH)2]+H+ sites are stable at either lower temperature or low H2 pressure. High H2 pressure and high-temperature lead to the formation of corresponding GaHx species, which were regarded as stable species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts at high temperatures. The increase in PDH rate with Ga/Al ratios (Figure 6h) showed that PDH rates increase as Ga/Al ratios rise to 0.1 and level off with the further increase in Ga/Al ratios. Ga normalized PDH rates showed a decreasing catalytic rate with the increase of Ga loading (Figure 6i), indicating the highly active Ga species were introduced at low Ga loading, and a higher Ga loading led to the formation of less active or inactive Ga species. The [GaH]2+ (estimated via NH3-TPD) normalized reaction rate was independent of the Ga/Al ratio (Figure 6j), based on which [GaH]2+ was assigned as the active center in PDH.
Schreiber et al. and Phadke et al.[76, 77] both pointed out the importance of framework Al pairs in the formation of active species for PDH, however, they proposed different active site structures and reaction mechanisms. Here, we discuss possible causes leading them to different conclusions. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared via different methods, that is, conventional impregnation and vapor-phase exchange of H+ with GaCl3. The vapor-phase exchange approach could ensure Ga species were only introduced via the ion-exchange mechanism. On samples prepared by impregnation at Ga/Al ratios  0.5, a 1:1 exchange ratio between Ga and BAS was determined after reduction at high temperature with hydrogen, suggesting complete conversion of Ga2O3 into intraporous cationic Ga species. Thus, Ga species are expected to exist only the in cationic form balancing negative charges of the framework in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples (Ga/Al  0.5), regardless of the preparation methods. The potential for preferential siting of cationic Ga species with different synthesis methods, however, cannot be ruled out, although it has not been substantiated by experimental evidence.
Another key difference is the state of catalysts when the densities of BAS were determined. While the BAS density was determined on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 by Schreiber et al., Phadke et al. conducted both FTIR and NH3-TPD on the oxidized form of catalysts. The proposed mechanism by Phadke et al. (Figure 6e) suggested that the density of BAS remained unchanged regardless of the oxidation state of the catalyst.[100] The opposite was also reported, where BAS density increased upon oxidation of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5.[110, 121] In addition, quantification of BAS density using pyridine as a probe molecule is more accurate than the estimate based on the area of the OH band (3600 cm1) because this band is easily obscured by the background at low BAS densities.[126] This is relevant because densities of active Ga species are typically calculated based on measured BAS densities. Schreiber et al. also claimed that Ga mostly existed in the form of Ga+ in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on the H2 pulse reaction analysis, while the presence of Ga+ was not considered by Phadke et al. Subsequent reports from the same group[76, 101] found Ga species exchanged with paired framework Al atoms and isolated framework Al atoms exhibited similar catalytic properties in ethane dehydrogenation. It should also be noted that Schreiber et al. and Phadke et al. employed Ga/H-ZSM-5 with quite different Si/Al ratios of the zeolite support (50 and 16.5, respectively). Assuming Al is distributed randomly in the zeolite framework, Al-rich zeolites would have higher densities of paired framework Al sites, which could have a sizable impact on Ga speciation.
Impact of Ga/Al and Si/Al Ratios on Ga Speciation
To gain a more thorough picture of Ga speciation, it is important to systematically investigate Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with different densities of framework Al pairs and Ga loadings. In general, lower Si/Al ratios are expected to lead to higher densities of framework Al pairs in zeolites. Yuan et al. investigated Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with three Si/Al ratios of the zeolite support, that is, 15, 28, and 39, and each in a wide range of Ga loadings.[54, 55, 110] The notation of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (X, Y) is employed below, with X and Y denoting the Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratio, respectively. As mentioned above, a 1:1 Ga/BAS exchange ratio was observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with all three Si/Al ratios at sufficiently low Ga/Al ratio (Figure 7a). The Ga/BAS exchange ratio started to deviate from unity at Ga/BAS ratios of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.4 on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, Y), respectively, suggesting that not all Ga existed as cationic species. BAS cannot be completely exchanged by Ga at Ga/Al ratios as high as 1.7. This is an indication that the formation of Ga oligomers in the zeolite micropores is more favored as BAS becomes scarce,[100] and that a fraction of BAS could be located at crystallographic positions inaccessible to Ga species.
