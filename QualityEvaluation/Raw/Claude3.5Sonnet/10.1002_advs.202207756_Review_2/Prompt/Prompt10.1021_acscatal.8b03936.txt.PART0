Abstract 
Aluminosilicate zeolites are widely used as acid catalysts, and different types of acid sites 
on these materials have been identified and characterized thoroughly. However, distinct acid sites 
on zeolites generated during reaction, such as the Brnsted acid sites on NaY upon exposure to 
organic acids and esters shown in our recent works (referred to as extrinsic sites), remain largely 
unexplored. In this work, we determine the density of extrinsic Brnsted acid sites generated on 
NaY by acetic acid and methyl acetate by quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. Kinetic investigations 
using isopropanol dehydration as a model reaction show that the catalytic characteristics of the 
extrinsic Brnsted acid sites on NaY are not only different from intrinsic Brnsted acid sites on 
proton-exchanged faujasites, but also dependent on the precursor molecule, e.g., acetic acid and 
methyl acetate. The rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY is found to scale linearly with the 
square root of the partial pressure of co-fed acetic acid, rather than the quantity of spectroscopically 
measured Brnsted acid sites. We propose that the self-dissociation of acetic acid in the highly 
ionic zeolite pore network generates protons that are active for the dehydration reaction, and only 
fraction of these protons, i.e., those that are associated with the zeolite framework, can be identified 
spectroscopically. When co-feeding methyl acetate, the rate of isopropanol dehydration on NaY 
increases linearly with the quantity of spectroscopically measured Brnsted acid sites, which is 
attributed to the fact that the self-dissociation of methyl acetate does not generate active protons 
within the zeolite pore.

1. Introduction 
 
Zeolites are crystalline, microporous materials with well-defined and tunable acid sites, 
and are used extensively as catalysts for a broad range of chemical transformations, especially in 
the petrochemical industry.1-3 The isomorphic substitution of Al for Si within the zeolite topology 
generates a negative framework charge, which must be balanced by a cation in the zeolite pore. 
The acid-base properties of zeolites can be tuned by changing the identity of this balancing cation. 
Proton-exchanged zeolites are Brnsted acidic, while metal cation-exchanged zeolites exhibit 
Lewis acidic or even basic characteristics.4-8 Due to their industrial significance, acid sites on 
several common zeolite frameworks have been thoroughly characterized by numerous research 
techniques, including various spectroscopies, computational models, temperature-programmed 
desorption of probe molecules, and model reactions.3-13 Experimental techniques generally aim to 
characterize intrinsic zeolitic acid sites, i.e., those present on the material regardless of the reaction 
system, because these sites are generally assumed to be exclusively responsible for the catalytic 
properties of the zeolite. However, our recent works demonstrate that Brnsted acid sites (BAS) 
can be generated on a solely Lewis acidic zeolite, NaY, upon the dissociative adsorption of organic 
acids (Scheme 1). The acidic hydrogen of the organic species exchanges with surface Na+ cations, 
generating an adsorbed sodium salt and a BAS on the zeolite framework. The BAS generated via

this ion exchange process, referred to as extrinsic BAS in this study, produce an infrared band at 
3645 cm-1 on the NaY sample, indistinguishable from the (AlOH) mode of intrinsic BAS on 
faujasites.14 Like carboxylic acids, methyl esters can also undergo ion exchange with Na+-
exchanged faujasite, generating adsorbed sodium salts and surface methoxy groups.15 When the 
latter interact with water, extrinsic BAS are generated, confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy with 
pyridine as the probe molecule. We have shown that the extrinsic BAS on NaY are catalytically 
active in the decarbonylation of methyl lactate to acetaldehyde.16,17 However, catalytic properties 
of the extrinsic BAS are entirely unknown because these sites are not observed by standard ex situ 
characterization techniques, i.e., in the absence of an organic acid or ester which serves to generate 
new sites in situ.  
 
In this work, we employ a combination of spectroscopic and kinetic techniques to 
demonstrate that the catalytic properties of the extrinsic BAS on NaY are not only fundamentally 
different from those of intrinsic BAS on faujasites, but also dependent on the identity of the organic 
acid or ester precursor. Acetic acid (AA) and methyl acetate (MA) are used as precursors to 
generate the extrinsic BAS on NaY, and the density of generated sites is determined using 
quantitative FTIR spectroscopy. The ion exchange is governed by a Langmuir-type adsorption 
equilibrium, where framework negative charges act as immobile adsorption sites. Employing 
isopropanol (IPA) dehydration as a model reaction, the activation energies and TOF over both 
extrinsic and intrinsic BAS are measured, demonstrating the two types of sites have different 
catalytic properties. The IPA dehydration rate exhibits a linear dependence on the square root of 
the partial pressure of co-fed AA, leading us to propose a novel model to describe how the 
dissociative adsorption of AA on NaY generates the extrinsic BAS. The self-dissociation of AA 
within the highly ionic and confined zeolite pore generates two types of extrinsic BAS with

equivalent catalytic activity in IPA dehydration. However, only protons which associate with 
the zeolite framework generate distinct spectroscopic modes, causing the quantitative FTIR to give 
inaccurate values for total site concentration. We show that this model is also consistent with the 
observed activity of the extrinsic BAS generated by MA on NaY.  
 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Materials Preparation 
 
NaY (nominal Si/Al = 2.5) was purchased from Zeolyst International (CBV-100). 
Materials characterization measurements of this commercial sample have been previously 
reported.18 The Si/Al ratio measured by 29Si solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic 
resonance (SS-MAS-NMR) is 2.2; X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements show good agreement 
with the SS-MAS-NMR results. 27Al SS-MAS-NMR shows no detectable level of signal 
corresponding to octahedrally coordinated extra-framework alumina species. The powder X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) pattern is consistent with that of faujasite zeolite crystals, and XRF 
measurements indicate the Na+/Al ratio is 1; no additional Na+ exchange treatments were 
performed prior to activity testing. The partially proton-exchanged materials were synthesized ex 
situ using an aqueous solution of NH4NO3 with a predetermined total ion ratio NH4+/Na+ < 1. The 
resulting samples are denoted as NaHYX, where X is the number of protons (in mol) per gram 
measured via quantitative pyridine adsorption FTIR (described below). The silicalite-1 sample was 
synthesized using the following procedure: 1.85 g of Cabosil M-5 was mixed with 6.89 g of 
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and 23.6 g of H2O under stirring for 1 h, and then HF 
(0.65 g) was added to the mixture. The final gel composition of 50 H2O /0.44 TPAOH/1 SiO2/0.5

HF was placed in Teflon-lined autoclave at 175 C for 5 days. All zeolite samples were calcined 
at 500 C (1 C/min temperature ramp) for 6 h before use.  
Double deionized water was produced in-house by a Thermo Barnstead Mega Pure-1 Still 
deionizer. Isopropanol was obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific, while acetic acid, methyl 
acetate, pyridine, di-isopropyl ether, and sodium acetate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; all 
chemicals were used without further purification. Grade 5 (>99.99%) purity gaseous propylene for 
gas chromatograph calibration, Grade 5 (>99.99%) purity gaseous N2 for balancing carrier gas 
during activity testing, and Grade 5 (>99.99%) purity helium and hydrogen for product analysis 
and quantification were all obtained from Keen Gas. 
 
2.2 Materials Characterization 
 
XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Discover powder diffractometer with a Cu 
K source ( = 1.5418 Å) over the range 2 = 5  50 with a step size of 0.025 at 2 s per step. 
Textural characterization of the samples was performed using N2 adsorption at 77 K after 
degassing at 623 K for 6 h under vacuum. Isotherms were collected on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 
instrument, and micropore volumes were calculated using the t-plot method. X-ray fluorescence 
measurements were performed on a Rigaku WD-XRF instrument utilizing provided spectral 
analysis software. Solid-state 29Si (99.83 MHz, 10 kHz rotational speed, 512 scans) and 27Al 
(130.29 MHz, 10 kHz rotational speed, 512 scans) magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic 
resonance (SS-MAS-NMR) were performed on a Bruker AVIII500 NMR spectrometer with a 44 
mm HZ MAS probe for all measurements. We employed the standard method for calculating the 
Si/Al ratio from 29Si-MAS-NMR described by Engelhardt, et al., using the relative area of each Si 
peak (corresponding to particular Si(nAl) coordination).19

2.3 Transmission FTIR Spectroscopy 
 
In-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on a ThermoFisher 
Scientific Nicolet 6700 FTIR Spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector and a custom in situ 
transmission cell, collecting 128 scans per spectrum at a spectral resolution of 2 cm-1. Temperature 
control in the transmission cell is achieved through the use of heating tapes and insulation 
connected to a tuned PID controller. Vacuum levels of <0.1 mTorr are achieved through 
connection to a vacuum manifold containing both a mechanical pump and a diffusion pump. For 
experimental tests, a self-standing zeolite wafer is loaded into a custom-made sample holder for 
vertical alignment in the infrared beam. The samples were annealed at 450 C under vacuum to 
completely remove surface adsorbates before cooling to the desired temperature. The appropriate 
species or mixture was then introduced to the transmission cell via the vacuum manifold. The 
amount of species in each dose, measured via the total system pressure, is controlled via a vacuum 
manifold. 
 
Integrated molar extinction coefficients (IMEC) for protonated pyridine (pyridinium) was 
measured using the following procedure. The density of Brnsted acid sites on a proton-exchanged 
faujasite sample was measured via an isopropylamine decomposition quantification procedure as 
described in a previous publication.20 This sample was then loaded into the transmission FTIR cell, 
annealed, and cooled to 225 C; a background spectrum was taken at this temperature. Pyridine 
was then introduced into the transmission cell for several minutes prior to evacuation, and this 
dosing procedure was repeated until the adsorbed pyridinium band increased by less than 1% 
between doses, after which the final spectrum was collected (Figure S1). The 1545  1540 cm-1 
spectral band associated with pyridinium was integrated using OMNIC software, and the IMEC 
(Py) was calculated using the following equation:

where Sp is the catalyst wafers cross-sectional surface area in cm2, mp is the dry mass of the 
catalyst wafer in grams, and [H+] is the density of Brnsted acid sites in mol/gcatalyst. To calculate 
the dry mass of the catalyst, the mass loss between room temperature and 450 C was measured 
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air. The water mass percentage of samples in this work 
varied between 1016%. After the extinction coefficient was measured (10%), the same 
procedure and equation were applied to measure the Brnsted acid site density of other zeolite 
samples. The measured value of Py at 225 C is 1.0  0.1 cm/mol. 
 
To determine the IMEC of sodium acetate (Acet), an incipient wetness impregnation 
procedure was used to distribute a known quantity of sodium acetate salt (50  200 mol/gcatalyst) 
within the pore network of the commercial NaY sample. The peak area of the 1585 cm-1 vibrational 
band was measured at 275 C using OMNIC software over multiple trials at various loadings. The 
Acet was then calculated using Equation 2.2:

Where  (in cm/mol) is the slope of a linear fit between the band area (in cm-1) and the total molar 
loading (dry mass multiplied by loading per gram) over surface area of the pellet (units = 
mol/cm2). The calibration curve is presented in Figure S2. No sodium acetate was lost during the 
heating procedure. The same procedure was then applied to determine the sodium acetate 
concentration after adsorption of AA and MA to NaY.

Catalytic activities were evaluated using an up-flow fixed bed reactor consisting of a quartz 
tube with an inner diameter of 4 mm at atmospheric pressure inside a ThermoFisher Lindberg Blue 
M furnace with a PID temperature control via a custom LabVIEW program. An inert thermocouple 
(no detectable catalytic activity at the temperatures employed) was placed directly above the 
catalyst bed, and temperature fluctuations in the catalyst bed were restricted less than  0.5 C. All 
catalysts were pressed and sieved (20-40 mesh) prior to loading into the reactor. When the required 
loading of active material was < 10 mg, the catalyst was diluted with inert quartz powder prior to 
the press/sieve procedure. Catalysts were pretreated at 500 C for 0.5 1 h under 50 mL/min dry 
air flow to remove water and other adsorbates. The liquid-phase feed was introduced to the reactor 
via a syringe pump, and the partial pressures of reactants were controlled via the composition and 
flow rate of the solutions. The N2 carrier gas flow rate was constant at 50 mL/min, and total reactor 
pressure was 1 bar. All reactor lines were heat-traced to > 125 C to prevent condensation of 
reactants, co-feeds, or products (all lines show no detectable catalytic activity). An on-line gas 
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Agilent 7890B GC and 5973 MS) equipped with a DB-FFAP 
capillary column and a flame ionization detector was used for product identification and 
quantification. Conversion, product yields, and turnover frequencies (TOF) were calculated as 
follows:

the carbon number of species i, n is the number of moles of active sites in the catalyst bed, and FR 
is the flow rate of reactant in moles per unit time.  
 
For activity measurements, the catalyst bed temperature was allowed to settle at 275 C for 
at least 30 min to minimize temperature gradients. The reactant solution was then introduced, and 
initial rates were measured at 10 min time on stream. Activation energy measurements were 
conducted at 255  295 C with data points in 10 C increments, varying T randomly while keeping 
propylene yield to < 10% to remain within the differential conversion regime. At TOS > 1 h, the 
temperature was returned to 275 C to check for catalyst deactivation. Deactivation was < 5%
