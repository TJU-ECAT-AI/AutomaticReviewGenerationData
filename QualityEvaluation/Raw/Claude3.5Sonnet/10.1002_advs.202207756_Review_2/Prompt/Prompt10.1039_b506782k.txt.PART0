The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by
diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy. Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and
univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms. The stronger molecular adsorption of
ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already
at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative
adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At
high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and
hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is
formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride
species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons. This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences
for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation.
Introduction
Hydrogen forms of ZSM-5 zeolite modified by zinc or gallium
ions are known as catalysts for the aromatization of light
paraffins.19 A generalized mechanism consists of the activa-
tion of the paraffinic molecules by dehydrogenation over the
modifying cations and subsequent oligomerization of the
resulting olefins over Brnsted acid sites. It is less clear which
sites catalyze the formation of aromatics. Besides acid sites,
also further dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon oligomers creat-
ing conjugated unsaturated fragments that are finally con-
verted
into
substituted
aromatics
or
coke,
should
be
considered.
In our previous studies we concluded that the active sites for
dissociative hydrogen1012 and methane13,14 or ethane disso-
ciative adsorption and dehydrogenation15 over zinc-modified
HZSM-5 are acidbase pairs involving low-coordinated biva-
lent zinc cations located at isolated aluminum-occupied oxygen
tetrahedra and distantly separated basic oxygen atoms of the
zeolite framework. As the positive charge of these Zn21 cations
is only partially compensated, they show properties similar to
Lewis super acids. Molecular adsorption of ethane by such
sites is peculiar. Due to the strong polarizability of the ad-
sorbed ethane molecules the intensity of one of the infrared
bands belonging to CH vibrational stretching modes increases
strongly, indicating selective polarizability of the correspond-
ing vibration.
Typically above 450 K, heterolytic dissociative adsorption of
ethane takes place resulting in the formation of zincethyl
fragments and acid protons that compensate the negative
framework charge at the basic sites of the zeolite framework.
Subsequent decomposition of alkyl species results in formation
of ethylene. In summary, the following reaction scheme
was proposed
ZO  Zn21  ZO  C2H6 - ZO  Zn21-C2H6  ZO
ZO  Zn21-C2H6  ZO - ZO  Zn21-C2H5
 ZO  H1
ZO  Zn21-C2H5
  ZO  H1 - ZO  Zn21-H
 ZO  H1  C2H4

In the present work, we carried out a similar DRIFT
experiments for ethane adsorption and dehydrogenation on
reduced gallium cations in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite and compared
the obtained results with those for zinc modified ZSM-5
samples. The reduced Ga species were chosen because they
are predominant under typical reaction conditions during
alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. We have found
that the activation of ethane over Ga1 and Zn21 cations
proceeds via two dinstinctly different mechanisms. The con-
sequences of these different ways of alkane activation are
evaluated by studying the catalytic conversion of ethane over
zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5.
Experimental
Materials
The initial hydrogen form of ZSM-5 was prepared by decom-
position of NH4ZSM-5 zeolite from AlSi-Penta with a frame-
work SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of approximately 44 in flowing air at
773 K. Gallium modification was achieved by chemical reac-
tion of HZSM-5 with Ga(CH3)3 as described earlier,16,17 while
Zn/ZSM-5 was prepared by exposing well-dehydrated HZSM-

5 to zinc metal vapor, leading to the replacement of Brnsted
acid protons by divalent zinc cations concomitant with evolu-
tion of molecular hydrogen.1315 This leads to final metal to Al
ratios of Ga/Al  1 and Zn/Al  0.5, respectively. The
preparation was carried out in situ in an optical cell or in an
Ar-flushed glove-box. In the case of Ga/ZSM-5 preparation,
we exposed a pellet of dehydrated zeolite to Ga(CH3)3 (Strem
Chemicals) vapor in the optical cell also used for subsequent
DRIFT measurements. Subsequent reduction of the modified
zeolite by molecular hydrogen to remove the methyl groups
was carried out in situ and was followed by evacuation at
773 K. Previous studies16,17 have shown that this method leads
to the quantitative substitution of protons and transformation
of the gallium alkyl into Ga11 species.
Infrared spectroscopy
Spectral measurements were carried out after in situ pretreat-
ment in an optical cell equipped with a CaF2 window.18 Ethane
adsorption was carried out at various pressures. DRIFT
spectra were recorded at room temperature by a Nicolet
Impact 410 spectrophotometer equipped with a home-made
diffuse reflectance attachment. The measurements were carried
out either in the presence of gaseous ethane or after evacuation
of ethane at room or elevated temperature. All spectra were
transformed into KubelkaMunk units by a standard program
assuming that the reflectance ability of the zeolite at 5000 cm1
was equal to 0.9. Subsequently, the background created by the
zeolites was subtracted from the spectra. Ethane was purified
before spectral measurements by triple vacuum distillation
after freezing at liquid nitrogen temperature.
Reactivity
A model catalytic study of ethane dehydrogenation and aro-
matization was carried out in a single-pass flow reactor
equipped with a sixteen-valve sample loop system for chroma-
tographic (GC-17A, FID, KCl/Al2O3 Plot column) product
analysis at short reaction times. The feed consisted of a helium
flow of 100 N ml min1 containing 1 vol% ethane. After
preparation in an Ar-flushed glove-box, catalysts were loaded
in the quartz reactor and transferred to the reaction setup in
protective atmosphere. The catalyst weight amounted to 50 mg
for both zinc or gallium modified ZSM-5 zeolites. Catalyst
pretreatment involved in situ reduction in hydrogen at a rate of
100 N ml min1 whilst heating from room temperature to
823 K at a rate of 5 K min1. The reaction temperature was
823 K and the reaction products were followed for 3 h.
Results and discussion
Infrared spectroscopy
Fig. 1 displays the DRIFT spectrum of ethane adsorbed on Zn/
ZSM-5 at room temperature.15 The spectrum consists of a
superposition of infrared bands resulting from two different
modes of molecular absorption. Four narrow high-frequency
bands belong to weakly adsorbed species that disappear upon
evacuation at room temperature. The broad band that has
been shifted strongly to lower frequencies corresponds to a
stronger form of molecular adsorption, ascribed to ethane
molecules that are very strongly polarized by zinc cations of
which the positive charge has only been partially compen-
sated.912 Complete removal of this band is possible only after
very prolonged evacuation at room temperature. Fig. 2 shows
that at very low hydrocarbon partial pressures the DRIFT
spectrum of this form of molecular adsorption can be well
separated from the weaker physical adsorption. Already below
500 K, this complex decomposes giving a zincethyl fragment
concomitant with regeneration of Brnsted acid protons iden-
tified by the characteristic stretching band of hydroxyl groups
at 3610 cm1. Further heating above 500 K decomposes the
zincethyl fragment to ethylene and zinchydride species.15
The DRIFT spectrum of ethane adsorbed by reduced Ga/
ZSM-5 is shown in Fig. 3. Comparison of this spectrum with
the one of ethane adsorbed by Zn/ZSM-5 shows that the high-

frequency parts of both spectra are identical. Moreover, as
follows from Fig. 3, a similar DRIFT spectrum with lower
intensity was observed for ethane adsorption on the hydrogen
form of the same zeolite. This indicates relatively weak physical
absorption of ethane by HZSM-5 or the Ga1 cations in
reduced Ga/ZSM-5. Further support for this weak absorption
is provided by the observation that upon a decrease of the
ethane partial pressure the narrow DRIFT bands in the spectra
of Ga/ZSM-5 and HZSM-5 decreased in intensity in a similar
fashion and completely disappeared after evacuation at room
temperature.
On the other hand, Fig. 4 shows that after heating of
Ga/ZSM-5 in ethane atmosphere to 523 K four much weaker
CH stretching bands with maxima at 2882, 2914, 2939 and
2962 cm1 appeared which could not be destroyed by evacua-
tion at room temperature. This result points to dissociative
adsorption of ethane on univalent Ga cations at elevated
temperature, the weak bands corresponding to ethyl species
grafted to Ga1. This suggestion is further underpinned by the
appearance of gallium-hydride species that were identified by
their infrared band at 2057 cm1 with a shoulder at 2040 cm1.
After further heating and decomposition of the grafted ethyl
species (vide infra), the infrared band around 2040 cm1
becomes dominant at the expense of the high-frequency band
(Fig. 5).
These findings present an important difference with the
heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane by the zincoxy-
gen acidbase pairs in Zn/ZSM-5. Whereas in the latter zeolite
the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane leads to the
reappearance of the infrared band at 3610 cm1 belonging to
Brnsted acid protons, no regeneration of protons was ob-
served for Ga/ZSM-5. From this we infer that dissociative
chemisorption proceeds via dissociative adsorption of ethane
to charge-compensating reduced Ga1 species, finally resulting
in the formation of gallium hydride and ethyl fragments
according to the following reaction
ZO  Ga1  C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5
)]1
(2)
Theoretical calculations are necessary to establish whether
this step is an elementary reaction or whether it involves
participation of basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.
Indeed, our previous study18 allowed the assignment of infra-
red bands in gallium-containing ZSM-5 in the region of 2040
2060 cm1 to gallium hydride species resulting from dissocia-
tive adsorption of molecular hydrogen by Ga1 ions. Moreover,
we found that the band with a maximum at 2040 cm1 belongs
to gallium dihydrides, while that one at 2057 cm1 relates to
gallium monohydride. We infer this from the change of the
single feature found at 2040 cm1 into two bands at 2040 and
2057 cm1 after oxidation of gallium dihydrides with nitrous
oxide. The former band is largely absent after complete oxida-
tion of GaH2
1 species. This is attributed to the following
reactions
ZO  Ga1  H2 - ZO  [Ga31(H)2]1
(3)
ZO  [Ga31(H)2]1  N2O -
ZO  [Ga31(H)(OH)]1  N2
(4)
Thus, the appearance of a band at 2057 cm1 provides
additional support for the dissociation of ethane over Ga1
species according to eqn. (2), giving a monohydride (band 2057
cm1) and a grafted ethyl fragment (bands between 2800 and
3000 cm1). The band at 2040 cm1 belongs to a gallium
dihydride species, possibly deriving from partial decomposi-
tion of the ethyl fragments.
The relatively high stability of the products of dissociative
ethane adsorption is in line with the high thermal stability of
gallium dihydride species that can only be eliminated by
desorption above 673 K.18 Prolonged heating of Ga/ZSM-5
in ethane atmosphere at a temperature of 573 K resulted in a
shift of the maximum of the band belonging to Ga-H from

2057 to 2040 cm1. This should point to the subsequent
dissociation of the ethyl species coordinating to Ga1 ions,
resulting in the formation of gallium dihydride species. Con-
comitantly, new CH stretching bands appear at higher fre-
quencies, i.e. at 3024, 3055 and 3072 cm1 (Fig. 5), that are
typical for olefins or aromatic hydrocarbons.

Comparison of infrared spectra of ethane adsorbed on zinc-
and gallium-modified ZSM-5 indicates that hydrocarbon acti-
vation over the charge-compensating reduced cations proceeds
via two distinctly different mechanisms. Over Zn/ZSM-5 ad-
sorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic
dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon
subsequent heating. On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane
much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was
only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane
dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions,
giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31
species. Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation
of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species.
Reactivity
The difference in the mechanism in alkane activation should
have direct consequences for the product mixture observed
during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion. To this end, we
studied conversion of ethane over Zn/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5
at elevated temperatures. The conversion as a function of the
reaction time for both zeolites is displayed in Fig. 6. Zn/ZSM-5
displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This
corresponds to the finding that ethane is more readily activated
over the zincoxygen acidbase pairs than over Ga1 cations.
Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction
time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction,
indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation.
Table 1 collects the selectivity data of both zeolites as a
function of the reaction time. The only product observed
during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene. The
further conversion of ethylene to oligomers or aromatics is
impeded by the absence of Brnsted acidity in reduced
Ga/ZSM-5, although one should also take into account the
relatively low conversion. Extensive studies in the past have
suggested that Brnsted acid protons are required for the
aromatization of the oligomeric intermediates.3 On the other
hand, Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits a much higher ethane conversion
and the product mixture contains aromatics, mostly benzene.
The concomitant formation of aromatic products should be
explained by the regeneration of Brnsted acid sites via hetero-
lytic dissociative adsorption of ethane according to reaction
(1). Moreover, this leads to coke formation as observed by a
physical colour change of the catalyst to black and pronounced
deactivation. Also, the carbon balance is not closed for
Zn/ZSM-5 (Table 1) due to the deposition of carbonaceous
residue in the catalyst bed. This deactivation leads to a lower
conversion, a concomitant increase in ethylene selectivity and
less pronounced coke formation at higher reaction times. This
may be primarily attributed to the deactivation of Brnsted
acid sites that play an important role in the formation of
aromatics and coke.
Conclusions
Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room tempera-
ture, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon
heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid
Zn21basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons.
Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and
hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative
addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures.
This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments
grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into
ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The absence of Brnsted acid
proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation
results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into
ethylene. On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher
initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and sec-
ondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of
Brnsted acidity.
