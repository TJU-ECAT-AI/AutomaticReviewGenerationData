Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. This process involves the breaking of C-H and N-H bonds, which is essential for converting feedstocks into valuable products. Studies conducted under spray-pulsed mode reactors and utilizing UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) conditions have significantly contributed to our understanding of these processes. Key research methods involve the use of supported catalysts, such as Ni on activated carbon (Ni/ACC), and the investigation of reaction conditions that optimize catalytic activity. Characterization techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and gas adsorption analysis are employed to assess catalyst properties and performance. These studies have led to the development of more efficient catalysts, enhancing the selectivity and productivity of dehydrogenation reactions, which is critical for advancing sustainable chemical processes and hydrogen energy systems.
