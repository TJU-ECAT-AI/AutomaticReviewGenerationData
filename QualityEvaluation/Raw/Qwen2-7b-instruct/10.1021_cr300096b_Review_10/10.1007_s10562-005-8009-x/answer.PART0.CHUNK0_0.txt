[1] "Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene has been carried out over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth ACC (Ni/ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor to study hydrogen evolution for hydrogen storage and supply system applications."
[2] "A small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) was added to the Ni based catalysts. A synergistic effect was observed in the case of the promoted catalysts the hydrogen production was enhanced by ca. 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt% Ni only catalyst."
[3] "As compared to 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst, the 20 wt% Ni0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst exhibits ca. 60 times higher hydrogen production rates."

The selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve the breaking of C-H and N-H bonds, which can lead to the creation of valuable products such as benzene from cyclohexane. In the context of catalytic processes, studies focusing on the dehydrogenation reactions often employ reactor systems, such as spray-pulsed reactors, to optimize the reaction conditions and catalyst performance. The use of supported catalysts, like Ni on activated carbon, facilitates the adsorption and activation of reactants, enhancing the reaction efficiency. The addition of a small amount of Pt to Ni-based catalysts demonstrates a synergistic effect, significantly increasing the hydrogen production rate compared to Ni-only catalysts. Furthermore, the introduction of a bimetallic catalyst (Ni and Pt) shows even higher hydrogen production rates, highlighting the potential benefits of metal combination in catalytic systems for enhancing reaction selectivity and efficiency.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域中扮演着至关重要的角色。这些反应涉及C-H和N-H键的断裂，可以产生如苯等有价值的产物。在催化过程的研究中，通常会使用反应器系统，例如喷射脉冲反应器，来优化反应条件和催化剂性能。使用支持型催化剂（如Ni在活性炭上的负载）有助于吸附和活化反应物，从而提高反应效率。向Ni基催化剂中添加少量Pt显示了协同效应，显著提高了与仅使用Ni催化剂相比的氢气生成速率。此外，引入双金属催化剂（Ni和Pt）显示了更高的氢气生成速率，这强调了金属组合在增强反应选择性和效率方面的潜在优势。
