"Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene has been carried out over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth ACC (Ni/ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor to study hydrogen evolution for hydrogen storage and supply system applications."
"The maximum rate of hydrogen evolution using monometallic Ni/ACC catalysts was 8.5 mmol g1cat min1 for Ni loading of 20% by weight."
"A small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) was added to the Ni based catalysts. A synergistic effect was observed in the case of the promoted catalysts the hydrogen production was enhanced by ca. 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt% Ni only catalyst."
"As compared to 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst, the 20 wt% Ni0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst exhibits ca. 60 times higher hydrogen production rates."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve the breaking of bonds, particularly C-H and N-H bonds, which are fundamental steps in many industrial processes. In the context of catalysis, researchers focus on optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions to enhance selectivity and efficiency. The study mentioned highlights the importance of catalyst design, specifically the use of Ni-based catalysts supported on activated carbon, and the enhancement of activity through the addition of small amounts of Pt. The results indicate that bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher hydrogen production rates compared to monometallic catalysts, showcasing the potential for improved performance in hydrogen storage and supply systems.

In terms of reactor studies, the spray-pulsed mode reactor used in this research provides insights into the kinetics and mechanism of dehydrogenation reactions, which are critical for process optimization. Such studies often employ UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) techniques to understand the surface chemistry and interactions at the atomic level, contributing to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms. This knowledge is essential for the development of more efficient catalysts and the improvement of existing processes in the fields of chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.
