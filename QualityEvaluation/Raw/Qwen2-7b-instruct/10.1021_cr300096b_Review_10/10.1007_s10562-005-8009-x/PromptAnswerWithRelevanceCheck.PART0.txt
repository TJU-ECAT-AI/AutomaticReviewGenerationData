The selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve the breaking of C-H and N-H bonds, which can lead to the creation of valuable products such as benzene from cyclohexane. In the context of catalytic processes, studies focusing on the dehydrogenation reactions often employ reactor systems, such as spray-pulsed reactors, to optimize the reaction conditions and catalyst performance. The use of supported catalysts, like Ni on activated carbon, facilitates the adsorption and activation of reactants, enhancing the reaction efficiency. The addition of a small amount of Pt to Ni-based catalysts demonstrates a synergistic effect, significantly increasing the hydrogen production rate compared to Ni-only catalysts. Furthermore, the introduction of a bimetallic catalyst (Ni and Pt) shows even higher hydrogen production rates, highlighting the potential benefits of metal combination in catalytic systems for enhancing reaction selectivity and efficiency.
