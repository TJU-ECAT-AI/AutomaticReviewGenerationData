<p>In the past years, various sophisticated bi- and multimetallic catalysts have been developed. The mostly used catalysts consist of Pt or Pd as active components, and Bi, Pb, or Te as promoter.</p>
<p>The promoter alone is inactive under reaction conditions but can dramatically enhance the reaction rate [10] ,[11] and selectivity [12] ,[13] .</p>
<p>Several methods have been developed for the fine tuning of the structure of the bimetallic catalysts and the improvements achieved are sometimes dramatic.</p>
<p>Clearly, on the surface of the particles the oxidation state of both metals is the same during dehydrogenation in Ar and during oxidation with molecular oxygen.</p>
<p>This observation conforms with the classical dehydrogenation mechanism of alcohol oxidation on Pt-group metals, namely that the reaction proceeds via dehydrogenation and the coproduct hydrogen is oxidized to water.</p>

1. The selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage because they enable efficient conversion of hydrocarbons and other organic molecules into valuable products. These reactions are fundamental in the creation of fuels, the production of chemicals, and the storage of hydrogen.

2. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies significantly contribute to our understanding of dehydrogenation processes over supported catalysts. These methodologies allow researchers to monitor the reactions under controlled conditions, providing insights into the mechanisms involved and the effects of various parameters on the catalytic performance.

3. Key research methods typically involve the use of advanced characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), including XANES and EXAFS, to determine the oxidation state of the catalyst components. This helps in understanding the structure-activity relationship at the solid/liquid interface. Reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the nature of the reactants, are meticulously controlled and varied to optimize the catalytic process.

4. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most effective conditions for achieving desired conversions and selectivities. They also shed light on the role of promoter metals, like Bi, Pb, or Te, in enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity of noble metals like Pt or Pd.

5. The findings from reactor and UHV studies suggest that the reduced state of both the noble metal and the promoter metal during oxidation reactions is consistent with the classical dehydrogenation mechanism of alcohol oxidation. This supports the notion that the promoter effect in alcohol oxidation is a heterogeneous catalytic phenomenon, rather than involving dissolution or homogeneous catalysis of the promoter.

1. 在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域，选择性脱氢反应发挥着关键作用，因为它们能够高效地将烃类和其他有机分子转化为有价值的产物。这些反应在燃料的生成、化学品的生产以及氢气的存储中至关重要。

2. 反应器研究和UHV（超高压）研究显著促进了我们对在负载催化剂上进行脱氢过程的理解。这些方法学允许研究人员在受控条件下监测反应，提供有关参与机制和各种参数对催化性能影响的见解。

3. 关键的研究方法通常涉及使用高级表征技术，如X射线吸收光谱（XAS），包括XANES和EXAFS，来确定催化剂组分的氧化状态。这有助于理解固体/液体界面的结构-活性关系。通过控制温度、压力和反应物的性质等反应条件，可以优化催化过程。

4. 这些研究通过识别实现所需转化率和选择性的最佳条件，为优化催化过程提供了信息。它们还揭示了促进剂金属（如Bi、Pb或Te）如何增强贵重金属（如Pt或Pd）的催化活性和选择性。

5. 反应器和UHV研究的结果表明，在氧化反应期间，两种金属（包括贵重金属和促进剂金属）处于还原状态，与醇的脱氢化机理一致。这支持了促进剂在醇氧化中的效果是异相催化现象的观点，而不是涉及促进剂的溶解或均相催化。
