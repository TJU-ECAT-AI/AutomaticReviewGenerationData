<p>1. Oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids over supported noble metal catalysts is an attractive green technology: molecular oxygen can be used as oxidant and the coproduct is water.</p>
<p>2. Numerous models have been proposed to interpret the role of promoters:</p>
<p>(i) According to a popular model, the selectivity enhancement is due to a complex formation between an α-functionalized alcohol, a surface Pt or Pd atom, and a positively charged promoter atom or promoter ion.</p>
<p>(ii) Geometric blocking of a fraction of active sites may be responsible for the rate acceleration.</p>
<p>(iii) The rate acceleration may be attributed to bifunctional catalysis, assuming that oxygen or OH radicals adsorbed on the promoter atom are involved in alcohol oxidation.</p>
<p>(iv) For a similar reason, Bi may act as a cocatalyst due to its higher affinity for oxygen and protect Pt or Pd from overoxidation.</p>
<p>(v) The improved catalytic performance might be attributed to the formation of an ordered alloy (intermetallic compound) between the active component (Pt or Pd) and the promoter atom (Bi or Te).</p>
<p>(vi) Finally, leaching of Bi as Bi3+ and the possible role of homogeneous complexes have also been thoroughly investigated.</p>
<p>3. The bimetallic catalyst was prepared by the preferential deposition of promoter metal adatoms onto the surface of Pd particles.</p>
<p>4. The series of (oxidative) dehydrogenation experiments carried out over BiPd/Al2O3 is illustrated in Fig. 4.</p>

1. Oxidation of alcohols to produce carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids using molecular oxygen as an oxidant is an environmentally friendly technology. Water is the coproduct.

2. Various models have been suggested to explain the role of promoters in enhancing catalytic activity. These include complex formation, geometric blocking of active sites, bifunctional catalysis involving oxygen or OH radicals, acting as a cocatalyst to protect noble metals from overoxidation, forming intermetallic compounds, and leaching of the promoter as Bi3+ ions.

3. The bimetallic catalyst was synthesized by depositing the promoter metal as adatoms on the surface of the Pd particles.

4. The dynamic changes in the activity and selectivity of the BiPd/Al2O3 catalyst were tracked during the transformation of 1-phenylethanol, as shown in Figure 4.
