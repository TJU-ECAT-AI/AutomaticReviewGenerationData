The inﬂuence of pretreatment temperature on the metal func-
tion of a commercial Pt-Re/Al2O3 reforming catalyst was studied
by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. By simultaneously examining
the rhenium LIII and platinum LIII EXAFS data, the bimetal-
lic interaction and the metal-support interaction can be distin-
guished from the overall spectrum. The results show that if the
catalyst is dried in air at temperatures ≤500◦C before reduction at
480◦C, bimetallic particles of platinum and rhenium are formed.
Drying at higher temperatures and in absence of air inhibits the
transport of mobile (rhenium) species on the surface causing no
intimate contact between the two metals. Platinum LIII EXAFS
data show that the average particle size of the bimetallic parti-
cles on the alumina surface is less than 10 ˚
A. The results from the
rhenium LIII EXAFS analysis conﬁrm that rhenium is not com-
pletely reduced to metallic rhenium after reduction, with a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of the rhenium present in low, positive oxidation
states and in intimate contact with the support. The EXAFS data
are consistent with a structural model of rhenium metal particles
1–3 nm wide with smaller platinum particles situated within or at
the boundary of the rhenium particles, and that moderate heat-
ing in presence of air (i.e., moist) provides the best conditions for
transport of mobile rhenium species on the surface, and hence alloy
formation.

INTRODUCTION
The catalytic reforming of naphtha is usually performed
using a bifunctional catalyst containing both a hydro-
genating metal and an acid function. The metal function
is platinum together with another component such as
rhenium, tin, iridium, or germanium. Chlorine-promoted
alumina with high surface area provides the acid function.
It has been demonstrated that the addition of rhenium

to Pt/Al2O3 leads to a catalyst with greater stability and
improved selectivity (1). However, the structure and exact
role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts have been
a matter of controversy. It has been proposed that metallic
rhenium provides sites for hydrogenolysis of coke deposits
(2) and that rhenium acts independently of platinum and is
able to convert coke precursors into harmless products (3).
Others state that rhenium anchors platinum to the alumina
support and thereby stabilises the platinum dispersion (4).
The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane
(MCH) has been used as a measure of the platinum dis-
persion in the catalysts.
The most common explanation of the properties of the
catalyst is based on Pt–Re alloy formation (5) and the in-
teraction of such an alloy with sulphur (6–9). It has been
shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic cata-
lysts is signiﬁcantly higher than over its monometallic coun-
terparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mix-
tures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12). Hydrogenolysis is a
structure-sensitive reaction and has therefore been used as
a probe reaction to determine Pt–Re alloy formation. In
addition, TPR-studies (13–15) have indicated possible re-
duction mechanisms leading to the formation of bimetallic
Pt–Re metal particles. Previous studies indicate that the
treatment of the catalyst prior to reduction strongly mod-
iﬁes the reducibility of rhenium and the extent of Pt–Re
alloy formation (16–19). Varying degrees of alloy forma-
tion have been conﬁrmed by both hydrogenolysis activity
measurements and hydrogen chemisorption experiments
(17). More direct evidence of alloy formation from phys-
ical characterisation techniques such as IR and XPS has
been difﬁcult to obtain due to the low metal loading and
high metal dispersion in the Pt–Re reforming catalysts.
Studies using EDX and TEM (20, 21) conclude that no
rhenium can be detected in the platinum particles in the
bimetallic system after reduction at 400◦C, although the
yields from reforming experiments indicate that a signiﬁ-
cant fraction of the rhenium must be present in the metallic

state. However, in a recent study (18) a high-resolution
combined STEM and EDX instrument were able to
detect bimetallic Pt–Re particles. It was established that
bimetallic interaction in Pt–Re/Al2O3 catalysts is highly
dependent on the pretreatment conditions. The highest
degree of Pt–Re interaction was found when the catalyst
was not dehydrated prior to reduction, while drying in N2
at high temperatures before reduction causes sintering of
platinum particles and low bimetallic interaction.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful tech-
nique for obtaining detailed information about the metal
containing species in highly dispersed systems lacking long-
range order. Several XAS studies on Pt–Re/Al2O3 have
been reported dealing with different aspects concerning the
metal function of the catalyst system. Recent studies have
made use of TPR and binding energies from the XAS spec-
tra to establish the correlation between calcination temper-
atures and bimetallic interaction (22). It is reported that
rhenium is completely reducible to metallic rhenium if the
samples are calcined at low temperatures and that the re-
duction step involves a rhenium intermediate with oxida-
tion state close to +I (23) leading to complete alloying of
platinum and rhenium. Michel et al. (24) found that the
metal loadings and the Re/Pt ratio affect the reduction
kinetics of rhenium but do not affect the ﬁnal oxidation
state of rhenium, and that even if the catalyst precursor
is dried, all of the rhenium is coreduced with platinum at
low temperatures when the catalyst contains ca. 1 wt%
chlorine.
Fung et al. (25) used EXAFS to characterise Pt–Re clus-
ters supported on γ -Al2O3 prepared from [Re2Pt(CO)12],
demonstrating that by using k0 weighting (k being the wave
vector) contributions from metal-support interactions and
bimetallic interaction (Pt–Re) may be distinguished in the
EXAFS data analysis. They conclude that the catalyst re-
duced at 400◦C in H2 contained a considerable fraction of
bimetallic particles consisting of Re4Pt2 entities and dis-
playinghighdispersion(averageparticlesizelessthan10 ˚

and strong interaction between rhenium atoms and the sup-
port. For further details, we refer to Xiao and Puddephatt
(26), who have published a comprehensive review on the
structure and reactivity of Pt–Re clusters.
There are several experimental obstacles associated
with XAS data collection on this catalyst system, with
the most important being low metal loading. Samples
with metal loadings as low as 0.3 wt% require the spectra
to be recorded in the ﬂuorescence mode rather than
the transmission mode. Furthermore, interference from
overlapping EXAFS regions excludes part of the EXAFS
region associated with the platinum LIII and LII absorption
edges (27). Accordingly, one can either choose to use
the limited EXAFS region associated with the platinum
LIII and LII edge or use the EXAFS associated with the
platinum LI edge, which is not affected by intervening
rhenium edges but exhibits a considerably weaker signal
compared to the LIII edge. By comparing preliminary data
for all three platinum L edges, data associated with the
platinum LIII adsorption edge (11,565 eV) were found to be
most suitable for this EXAFS study. Due to the similarity
in backscattering properties for the two noble metals
involved, simultaneous investigations of data taken from
representative reference systems and the use of both k0 and
k3 weighting schemes are important for the deconvolution
of contributions from the different backscatterers (25). We
report here an examination of samples from four different
pretreatment procedures by the use of X-ray absorption
spectroscopy.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Pretreatment Procedure
The standard EUROPT-4 commercial catalyst (CK433)
containing 0.3 wt% platinum and 0.3 wt% rhenium sup-
ported on γ -Al2O3 was manufactured by Akzo, Holland.
The chlorine loading was 0.95 wt%. The precalcined
EUROPT-4 catalyst extrudates were ﬁnely grounded and
sieved to give a particle size fraction of 0.25–0.075 mm.
In order to use the allocated beam time at the ESRF
and Brookhaven laboratories as efﬁciently as possible the
samples were dried and reduced ex situ in our home labo-
ratory. After reduction, the samples were sealed in quartz
capillary tubes as described below to prevent exposure to
air. This procedure avoids time-consuming in situ pretreat-
ment at the synchrotron facility. In order to verify that the
sealing procedure was successful, some of the samples were
reduced in situ using an environmental cell developed by
Lytle et al. (28).
Pretreatment was carried out in a standard apparatus
equipped with Alltech molsieves and O2-traps for gas puri-
ﬁcation. Steady gas ﬂows (30 ml/min) were maintained by
using mass-ﬂow controllers. The catalyst was placed on a
quartz sinter inside a tubular ﬂow-through quartz micro-
reactor with quartz capillary tubes (from Glas Technik &
Konstruktion, Germany) with outer diameter 2–3 mm and
wall thickness of 0.02 mm attached to the reactor wall. The
sample was heated to the desired temperatures using a fur-
nace equipped with a temperature controller. Four differ-
ent drying conditions prior to reduction at 480◦C for 1 h
using a heating rate of 0.8◦C/min were examined. One sam-
ple labelled PR-0 was reduced directly without any drying.
A second sample labelled PR-240/air was dried in air at
240◦C for 16 h before reduction. Another sample labelled
PR-500/air was dried in air at 500◦C for 16 h before re-
duction. The sample labelled PR-680/N2 was dried in dry
N2 at 680◦C for 16 h before reduction. After the reduc-
tion was ﬁnished the reactor was ﬂushed with helium for
30 min and cooled down to room temperature. The reactor
was sealed off at both ends using stainless steel valves and
turned upside down to allow the powdered sample to enter

the capillary tubes. Using a relatively narrow sieve fraction
of the catalyst powder (0.25–0.075 mm), easy ﬁlling and
uniform distribution of the sample inside the capillary tube
are ensured. The quartz tube containing the sample was
sealed using a high-temperature gas ﬂame, and detached
from the reactor. The inert atmosphere inside the reactor
and the relatively high ﬂame temperature (>1200◦C due to
the high melting point for quartz) prevented oxidation of
the catalyst PR-500/air inside the capillary tube. In order
to reduce heat transfer to the sample in the capillary, the
length of sample material was such that 2–3 cm of empty
capillary separated the sample from the ﬂame. A summary
of the samples involved and their characteristics are given
in Table 1. The volumetric hydrogen chemisorption mea-
surements were performed in a Micromeretics ASAP 2010
instrument at 25◦C.
XAS Measurements
XAS data were collected using the facilities of the
Swiss-Norwegian Beamline (SNBL) at the European Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), France and at Beam-
line Station X11-A at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. All
spectra were collected at room temperature.
At SNBL, spectra were obtained on station EH1 at the
platinum LIII edge (11,564 eV) and the rhenium LIII edge
(10,535 eV). A channel-cut Si(111) monochromator with
an unfocussed beam was used to scan the X-ray spec-
tra. The beam currents ranged from 130 to 200 mA at
6.0 GeV. Higher order harmonics were rejected by means
of a chromium-coated mirror angled at 3.5 mrad to give
a cut-off energy of approximately 14 keV. The maximum
resolution (1E/E) of the Si(111) bandpass is 1.4 × 10−4
using a beam of size 0.6 × 7.2 mm as deﬁned by the slits
in the station. Ion chamber detectors with their gases at
ambient temperature and pressure were used for measur-
ing the intensities of the incident (I0), transmitted (It), and
ﬂuorescent (If) X rays. The detector gases were as follows:
I0, detector length 17 cm, 100% N2; It, length 31 cm, 35%
Ar, 65% N2; If (Lytle detector, see below), 100% Ar.
XAS data were also collected at Beamline Station X11-
A at Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source. The
station is equipped with a double crystal Si(111) monochro-
mator and the storage ring is operated at 2.5 GeV with a
ring current of 180–350 mA. The beam size was deﬁned to
be 0.5 × 10 mm and the resolution approximately 2.0 × 10−4
at the actual energies. Higher order harmonics were sup-
pressed by tuning the monochromator crystals to 50% of
maximum intensity.
The ﬂuorescent radiation was collected using a detector
ofthetypedevelopedbyLytleetal.(28).Thesignal-to-noise
ratio was enhanced using a set of soller slits and Zn (3µ)
and Ga (3µ) ﬁlters for rhenium and platinum edges, respec-
tively. Due to the low metal loading, several scans were
taken and summed for each sample. The energy calibra-
tion was checked by measuring the spectrum of a platinum
foil (thickness 0.003 mm) and a rhenium foil (thickness
0.0125 mm) with the energy of the ﬁrst inﬂection point be-
ing deﬁned as the edge energy. The raw, unﬁltered Re LIII
and Pt LIII EXAFS spectra of the four samples are shown
in Fig. 1.
EXAFS Data Analysis
The data were corrected for dark currents, converted to
k-space, and summed and the background was subtracted
to yield the EXAFS function χ(k) using the EXCALIB and
EXBACK programs (29). Model ﬁtting was carried out with
EXCURV90 using curved-wave theory and ab initio phase
shifts (29, 30). During the least squares ﬁtting it is important
to minimise correlation effects between the parameters that
strongly affect the EXAFS amplitude and those that inﬂu-
ence the frequency of the EXAFS oscillations. Therefore,
the EXAFS spectra were least squares ﬁtted in k space us-
ing k0 and k3 weighted data. By carrying out this procedure
on appropriate reference compounds as well as for the un-
known spectra, more accurate coordination numbers can
be obtained than what otherwise would be the case. The
errors in the reﬁned parameters (31–33) are estimated to
be 10% in coordination number (N), 1% in distance (R),
10% in Debye–Waller type factors (2σ 2), and 10% in the
photoelectron energy at zero wave vector (E0). As an indi-
cation on the quality of the ﬁt, the residual index, Rχ(%) is

The k3 weighting scheme compensates for the diminishing
photoelectron wave at higher k values. Low k weighting
also enhances the contribution from lighter backscattering
atoms such as oxygen, and thereby allowing metal-support

interactions to be included in the analysis. However, due
to overlapping EXAFS regions for the platinum LIII and
rhenium LII edges, platinum LIII spectra have to be trun-
cated at approximately 9 ˚
A−1. Our approach to the data
analysis was similar to that used by Fung et al. (25). They
demonstrated that by analysing the XAFS data using k0
weighting, it is possible to distinguish Pt–Re from the Pt–Pt
and Re–Re interactions. The parameters obtained by Fung
et al. have been used as ﬁrst guesses for the bimetallic in-
teractions due to the lack of suitable model compounds
for the Pt–Re and Re–Pt scattering pairs. The preliminary
data analysis involved testing models that include contri-
butions from Pt, Re, and O scatterers for both platinum
and rhenium EXAFS data. Due to the narrow data range

lidity of the ab initio phase shifts and establish the general
parameters AFAC (amplitude reduction factor) and VPI
(accounts for inelastic scattering of the photoelectron) (29).
Structural parameters for the reference compounds (35–38)
are listed in Table 2. The unreduced catalyst samples were
used to check the validity of the amplitudes obtained from
reference compounds measured in transmission mode for
use on data of the reduced catalyst samples recorded in
ﬂuorescence mode.
XANES Proﬁle Analysis
The XAS data analysis program WinXAS (39) was used
for examining the XANES spectra of the reduced samples.
The method of using a linear combination of the near-edge
proﬁles from known reference compounds was used to ob-
tain information about the composition of the samples of
different pretreatment procedures. In order to establish
the degree of reduction in the reduced samples, the edge
proﬁles were analysed by linear combination of the refer-
ence proﬁles from the respective metal foil and the catalyst
sample prior to reduction.

together with their Fourier transforms are shown in Fig. 2,
and the platinum LIII spectra of the same samples are pre-
sented in Fig. 3. For the rhenium EXAFS, a structural
model including four shells, Re–Pt, Re–Re, and two differ-
ent Re–O distances associated with Re(+VII) oxide species
and support interaction, respectively, gave the best ﬁt and
realistic structural parameters for all samples except PR-
680/N2, which did not contain the contribution from the
Re–Pt shell. The platinum spectra of PR-0, PR-240/air, and
PR-500/air were best ﬁtted using a model constructed from
Pt–Re, Pt–Pt, and one single Pt–O contribution, the lat-
teroriginatingfrommetal-supportinteraction.TheEXAFS
spectrum of PR-680/N2, which was consistently lacking the
bimetallic interaction, was modelled by one Pt–Pt distance
and two different Pt–O contributions.
The relatively large Re–Re and Re–Pt coordination num-
bers show that the rhenium containing metal particles of
the samples in this study are signiﬁcantly larger than the
rhenium containing particles in the similar catalysts stud-
ied by Fung et al. (25). This is also reﬂected in the EXAFS
spectra in Fig. 2, where the oscillations persist as far out
as k = 13 ˚
A−1. The oscillations may also be affected by the
extent of alloy formation in the metal particles since the
Re–Re and the Re–Pt signals are out of phase within the re-
gion 10–13 ˚
A−1(25). The total metal-to-metal coordination
is six to nine atoms for all of the samples except PR-680/N2,
which is coordinated to only 1.5 metal atoms. A relatively
high proportion of the rhenium atoms in PR-680/N2 is not
completely reduced, and therefore exhibits relatively high
coordination to oxygen and thus correspondingly lower
metallic coordination. The rhenium EXAFS spectra of PR-
0 and PR500/air contain more features than the spectra
of PR-240/air and PR-680/N2, indicating enhanced compo-
site natures for the former. The spectrum from PR-680/N2 is
simpliﬁed due to the fact that there is only one metal–metal
contribution. The complexity in the spectra from samples
PR-0 and PR-500/air may arise from contributions from ox-
ides with rhenium in different oxidation states. For exam-
ple, ReO3 has a collinear arrangement of O–Re–O atoms
and hence multiple scattering processes contributing to the
spectrum. However, this contribution is not large enough to
be extracted from the overall spectrum, which is reﬂected
in the relatively poor quality of the ﬁt for PR-500/air (see
Table 2). The slightly longer Re–O distance (1.76 ˚
A) in PR-
500/air compared to ReO−
4 (1.74 ˚
A) is consistent with this
since the Re–O distance in ReO3 is 1.87 ˚
A. In PR-240/air,
the Re–O distance is even longer (1.93 ˚
A), being close to the
Re–O distance found in PR-680/N2 at 1.96 ˚
A. This Re–O
distance is most likely associated with rhenium atoms in low
oxidation states coordinated to oxygen in the support inter-
face. The low coordination number (0.4) of the oxygen shell
at 1.93 ˚
A in PR-240/air coupled with the partially overlap-
ping support interaction found at 2.13 ˚
A indicate that the
reliability of this distance is limited. The coordination shell
is, however, included in the ﬁtting since the contribution is
statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level (40).
From the rhenium EXAFS analysis, PR-240/air and PR-
500/air have the highest degrees of alloy formation (highest
Re–Pt coordination). PR-0, which is not dehydrated prior
to reduction, shows a signiﬁcantly lower bimetallic coor-
dination than PR-240/air and PR-0 and PR-500/air. This
does not agree with previous reports (13, 41) suggesting that

rheniumismoreeasilyreducedwhenwaterispresentonthe
surface allowing mobile rhenium oxide species to transport
rhenium to the platinum particles. This discrepancy may be
due to the fact that a signiﬁcant fraction of the rhenium
atoms is not completely reduced and that rhenium in low
oxidation states may affect the mobility of rhenium atoms
(23). The EXAFS data from PR-240/air exhibits the most
balanced coordination towards platinum and rhenium (4.8
and 5.2, respectively). PR-240/air also contains a larger frac-
tion of completely reduced rhenium. Consequently, moder-
ate heating in air (i.e., low drying temperature) prior to re-
duction provides the most suitable conditions for transport

of the mobile rhenium species on the surface, and hence

ature (PR-680/N2), the EXAFS analysis for both elements
is consistent with this model and also with our previous
EDXresults(18)conﬁrmingthatverylimitedalloyingtakes
place under such conditions. The relatively low alloy for-
mation in PR-0 is not reﬂected in the EXAFS analysis of
the other element, platinum, which accords well with the
aforementioned EDX results (see Tables 4 and 5). The re-
sults from the platinum EXAFS analysis show only minor
differences between samples PR-0, PR-240/air, and PR-
500/air. All three samples are characterised by a Pt–Pt

coordination of ca. 3 and Pt–Re coordination close to 1.
The relatively weak metal-support interaction at ca. 2.7 ˚
A
found in PR-0 and PR-240/air is not signiﬁcant for PR-
500/air. It has been reported that this metal-oxygen dis-
tance is typical for support interfaces, where chemisorbed
hydrogen is present and when reduced at temperatures
less than 450◦C (25, 42, 43). It thus appears that raising
the drying temperatures has an impact on the platinum-
support interface similar to that when the reduction tem-
peratures are raised, when dried in air (i.e., in presence
of moisture), since PR-680/N2 has a similar Pt–O dis-
tance, although slightly contracted. PR-680/N2 displays a
different spectrum from the other samples in the sense
that, as stated above, it contains no bimetallic contribu-
tion and a somewhat stronger interaction with the sup-
port than the other samples. The strength of the interaction
is reﬂected both in the higher Pt–O coordination and in
the contracted metal-support bonding distance compared
to the metal-support interaction in the other samples
(see Table 4). Another difference is that PR-680/N2 is not
completely reduced, or more likely passivated (reoxidised)
by oxygen after reduction. The Pt–Pt coordination is practi-
cally the same in this sample as for the three other samples.
Thus, the larger particle sizes found in the STEM images
of this sample (18) are not reﬂected in the EXAFS results.
Since STEM is not able to distinguish between platinum
metal and the oxide, this would indicate that the outermost
atomic layers of larger platinum particles are easily passi-
vated (44, 45) leading to smaller metal particles and hence
reduced coordination numbers.
The structural parameters obtained from the rhenium
and platinum EXAFS analysis can be summarised as fol-
lows: rhenium metal shows relatively high coordination to
both rhenium and platinum in addition to a strong metal-
support interaction, suggesting that relatively large (up
to 3 nm) rhenium particles are present on the surface.
Platinum EXAFS analysis shows high platinum dispersion
(small particles consisting of only a few atoms) coordinated
to both platinum and rhenium. These observations are
consistent with a metal particle model in which rhenium
particles are sited on the support interface. Smaller plat-
inum particles are situated within or at the boundary of
the rhenium particles. This is only true for the samples
PR-0, PR-240/air, and PR-500/air, which contain bimetal-
lic particles. The EXAFS analysis of PR-680/N2 conﬁrms
that the surface contains separate particles of rhenium and
platinum metal.
Particle Size and Composition
The high surface relaxations observed in small metal par-
ticles may lead to a signiﬁcant contraction of the metal–
metalbonddistancesrelativetothedistancesfoundforbulk
metal and to anharmonic pair distribution functions (46–
48). For small metal particles, the average, nearest neigh-
bour bond length decreases rapidly with decreasing parti-
cle diameter. Furthermore, the pair distribution functions
become increasingly anharmonic for smaller particle sizes
and may lead to signiﬁcant errors in the estimation of co-
ordination number and hence particle sizes. Consequently,
particle size estimates from EXAFS are usually associated
with relatively large uncertainty (ca. 20%). However, from
the low Pt-metal coordination (ca. 4) in the investigated
samples we conclude that the mean particle diameter in the
platinum containing samples must be small. The contrac-
tion in Pt–Pt distances from 2.77 ˚
A found for bulk plat-
inum down to approximately 2.67 ˚
A in the catalyst samples
are also an indication of small particles. Klimenkov et al.
(47) showed in a TEM study that a Pt–Pt atomic distance
of 2.65 ˚
A corresponds to a mean particle size of ca. 15 ˚
A
while Diaz-Moreno et al. used EXAFS to determine that
ﬁrst shell Pt–Pt coordination of 4 corresponded to a particle
size of approximately 8 ˚
A (48). It has been suggested that
Pt–Pt coordination of 4.8 atoms corresponded to particles
of diameter ca. 9 ˚
A and containing about 10 atoms (49, 50).
It may therefore be concluded that all samples contain plat-
inum metal particles of average diameter less than 10 ˚
A and
that the platinum dispersion is 100%.
The Re–Re distances are even more contracted com-
pared to bulk rhenium (2.74 ˚
A). Samples PR-0, PR-240/air,
INFLUENCE OF PRETREATMENT ON REFORMING CATALYSTS
301
and PR-500/air have Re–Re bond lengths of ca. 2.6 ˚
A even
though the metal–metal coordination number is larger than
for platinum. Such shortened Re–Re distances have been
explained by presence of oxophilic rhenium in a low posi-
tive oxidation state (25). The atomic fractions of platinum
CPt, listed in Table 5 are calculated by dividing the Pt–Pt co-
ordination number by the total Pt-metal coordination num-
ber. The results from the platinum EXAFS analysis show
negligible difference in CPt for samples PR-0, PR-240/air,
and PR-500/air, whereas PR-680/N2 shows no alloy forma-
tion. These results are practically identical with the EDX
results, although a weak trend towards higher Pt–Re in-
teraction for the samples dried at the lowest temperature
could be observed (18). The EXAFS results show that CPt
values obtained from the Re data are signiﬁcantly different
than the values from the Pt edge data. This inconsistency
indicates that the samples also contain monometallic par-
ticles. This is in contrast to the STEM/EDX studies, which
assume that all of the rhenium atoms are located in the
bimetallic particles such that CRe = 1 – CPt. Note that PR-
240/air, which shows the highest hydrogenolysis activity of
the four samples (18), has got the highest bimetallic inter-
action (CPt = 0.48).
Linear Combination of XANES Spectra
The shape of the absorption edge features and the white
line intensity contain information about the oxidation state
and chemical environment of the element in question.
The graphical presentation in Fig. 4 of the rhenium LIII
absorption edge proﬁles clearly shows that rhenium is not
completely reduced. The XANES proﬁle analysis gives a
measure of the fraction of completely reduced rhenium
in the sample. The amount of metallic rhenium deduced
from the EXAFS data is based on the reduction in Re–O

coordination number. From Table 6 it appears that EXAFS
overestimates the degree of reduction (relative to the total
amount of reducible rhenium). The number from the
EXAFS analysis excludes that fraction of irreducible
(under these conditions) rhenium that is in intimate
contact with the support. By including the metal-support
coordination number in the Re–O coordination number,
the results from the EXAFS and XANES data converge
to agreement. PR-240/air has a larger fraction of metallic
rhenium than the other samples, suggesting that the
higher reducibility of rhenium leads to a higher degree of
alloying, thus supporting the previously proposed rhenium
reduction mechanism (15, 18).
The XANES analysis of platinum LIII edge data is con-
sistent with the EXAFS data of the same element, showing
that practically all platinum is present as metallic platinum
in the samples PR-0, PR-240/air, and PR-500/air, while

PR-680/N2 is slightly reoxidised (see Table 6). This is also
reﬂected in the white line intensities of the platinum cata-

the proﬁle of the platinum metal foil.
Passivation
PR-0 was reduced in situ (in the X-ray beam) as a test
in order to establish whether or not the sample was reoxi-
dised in the quartz capillary tubes. The ﬁtted EXAFS spec-
trum of the sample is shown in Fig. 6. The EXAFS data in
Table 7 show that the amount of completely reduced rhe-
nium is higher in the in situ reduced sample with the fraction
of Re(0) being 78% compared to 63% in the sample sealed
in a capillary tube. No signiﬁcant reoxidation of platinum
was found. The reoxidation can be considered as passiva-
tion of the metal particles since it is limited to the surface
layers. Passivation by oxygen of supported platinum parti-
cles has been reported as being mainly limited to the surface
layer and hence proportional to the fraction of surface plat-
inum atoms (44, 50, 51). The oxide layer has Pt–O distances
close to that of PtO2 (ca. 2.00 ˚
A), which is the most stable

involved in the oxidation of the metal particles when chlo-
ride is present in the system (52, 53). The Re–Re coordina-
tion number is practically the same for the samples sealed
in capillary tubes and the one reduced in situ, while the
Re–Pt coordination is considerably lower and the Re–O
coordination accordingly higher in the passivated sample
(see Fig. 7). These results may explain why Macleod et al.
(21) in their TEM/EDX study were unable to detect any
neither bimetallic interaction nor metallic rhenium in their
catalyst samples. Most of the rhenium may have been ox-
idised to higher oxidation states since the bimetallic parti-
cles seem to be more prone to reoxidation than the particles
containing only rhenium. The weakened bimetallic interac-
tion in the quartz capillary sample compared to the in situ
reduced sample also indicate that the true bimetallic con-
tributions in the Pt–Re catalyst are larger than what are
reported here.

INFLUENCE OF PRETREATMENT ON REFORMING CATALYSTS
303
CONCLUSIONS
The effect of the pretreatment conditions on the metal
particles in Pt-Re/Al2O3 catalysts was studied for sev-
eral pretreatment procedures, using X-ray absorption
spectroscopy and by comparison with previous results
obtained by STEM/EDX (18) and catalytic measure-
ments (17).
The results show that if the catalysts are dried in air at
temperatures ≤500◦C before reduction at 480◦C, bimetal-
lic particles of platinum and rhenium are formed. Drying
at higher temperatures in absence of air inhibits the trans-
port of mobile (rhenium) species on the surface causing
no intimate contact between the two metals. Platinum LIII
EXAFS data show that the average particle size of the
bimetallic particles on the alumina surface is less than 10 ˚
A.
The results from the rhenium LIII EXAFS analysis conﬁrm
that rhenium is not completely reduced to metallic rhenium
in the catalysts after reduction. The short Re–Re distance
(ca. 2.6 ˚
A) suggests that oxophilic rhenium in low, positive
oxidation states are present. Rhenium interacts relatively
strongly with the support, which is reﬂected in the Re–O
interaction around 2.0 ˚
A that displays an average coordi-
nation number close to 1.0.
EXAFS data from the rhenium edge exhibits higher
coordination numbers towards platinum and rhenium
than those obtained from the platinum EXAFS data.
The relatively high Re–Re and Re–Pt coordination, to-
gether with the strong Re-support interaction, and plat-
inum being coordinated to approximately 1 rhenium and
3 platinum atoms, agree with a structural model of rhe-
nium metal particles 1–3 nm wide with smaller platinum
particles situated within or at the boundary of the rhenium
particles.
The catalyst sample dried at 240◦C in air prior to reduc-
tion at 480◦C (PR-240/air) contains more completely re-
duced rhenium than the other samples. The EXAFS data
from this sample exhibits the most balanced coordination
towards platinum and rhenium. These results show that
moderate heating in presence of air (i.e., moist) provides
the best conditions for transport of mobile rhenium species
on the surface, which is necessary for alloy formation.
