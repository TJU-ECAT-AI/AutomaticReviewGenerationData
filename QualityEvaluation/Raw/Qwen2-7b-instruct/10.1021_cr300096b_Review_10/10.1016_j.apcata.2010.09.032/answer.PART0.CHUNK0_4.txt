<p>The catalyst prepared using the PAA template also showed higher liquid recovery with less coke deposition and longer projected catalyst lifetime.</p>
<p>Characterization using infrared spectroscopy following the adsorption of CO revealed that catalysts made using the PAA method contained platinum particle surfaces with reduced atom coordination numbers.</p>
<p>In the present study, we applied polyacrylic acid (PAA) as a template to control the Pt nanoparticle surface structures during preparation of PtRe/Al2O3 reforming catalysts.</p>
<p>These improved catalysts have shown an increased reformate yield with lower aromatic production and longer projected life time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, calcination at 772 K not only shows no obvious change on nanoparticle surface structure (as indicated by unchanged catalyst activity) but also provides more stable activity during tests, which is a critical feature, enabling the catalyst prepared by the PAA method to survive long duration operations.</p>
<p>An appropriate volume of pre-prepared precursor solution was coated on high purity -alumina by gradual evaporation of water under rotation to provide the desired Pt and Re loading.</p>
<p>Product research octane number (RON) and C5+ liquid yield were evaluated as the main criteria for catalyst performance.</p>
<p>Catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25 provides an average C5+ yield at 84.2% and outperforms the commercial catalyst ComPt/Re0.25 by 1.4%.</p>
<p>Analyses of the coke deposited on the used catalysts after the normal condition tests in Fig. 1(A) and the aging tests in Fig. 2 are summarized in Table 2.</p>
<p>Less coke was deposited on the used PAAPt/Re0.25 catalyst (8.01 wt%) than on the used ComPt/Re0.25 catalyst (8.37 wt%) after the 328-h aging test, which contributes to the delay in the required temperature adjustments and the slightly higher C5+ yield observed for catalyst PAAPt/Re0.25 near the end of the aging test.</p>
<p>The IR results are therefore consistent with the observation of reduced coking on catalysts using PAA template during the accelerated coking experiments (Table 2),a result which further experimentally suggested the presence of novel Pt surface structure in the reforming catalysts using PAA as template.</p>

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage involves studying how specific bonds are broken under controlled conditions to enhance yield and efficiency. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies are crucial tools in this field. They allow researchers to understand the kinetics, mechanisms, and thermodynamics of these reactions over catalyst surfaces.

In reactor studies, conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates are varied to optimize the conversion of reactants into desired products. Techniques like gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy are used to monitor product formation and to identify intermediates. Catalysts are often characterized using methods like X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to understand how their properties affect reaction outcomes.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer insights into the atomic-scale interactions between catalyst surfaces and reactant molecules. By operating in ultra-high vacuum, researchers can minimize unwanted reactions and observe the precise details of surface reactions. Techniques like low-energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy in UHV environments enable detailed analysis of bond breaking and formation processes.

Both reactor and UHV studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by revealing the conditions that lead to the most effective conversions. For instance, the use of polyacrylic acid (PAA) as a template in the preparation of Pt/Re catalysts resulted in higher reformate yields, better stability, and reduced coke deposition. These improvements suggest that the PAA template affects the surface structure of the catalyst, leading to more selective dehydrogenation reactions. Understanding these effects can guide the development of more efficient and durable catalysts for various applications.

In conclusion, reactor studies and UHV studies are indispensable for advancing the field of selective dehydrogenation reactions. They provide a comprehensive view of the chemical processes involved, allowing for the refinement of catalyst designs and reaction conditions to maximize yield and minimize unwanted side reactions.

在化工生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域中分析选择性脱氢反应涉及到在控制条件下研究特定键的断裂，以提高产率和效率。反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究是这一领域的重要工具。它们允许研究人员了解反应物转化为所需产物的反应动力学、机制和热力学，特别是在催化剂表面。

在反应器研究中，温度、压力和流速等条件的变化被用来优化反应物向目标产品的转化。使用气相色谱法、质谱法和红外光谱法等技术监测产物形成并识别中间体。催化剂通常通过X射线衍射、扫描电子显微镜和透射电子显微镜等方法进行表征，以理解其性质如何影响反应结果。

另一方面，UHV研究提供了原子尺度上催化剂表面与反应分子之间相互作用的详细信息。通过在超高真空环境中操作，研究人员可以最小化不必要的反应，并观察表面反应的精确细节。低能电子衍射、X射线光电子光谱法和UHV环境中的红外光谱法等技术使研究人员能够对键的断裂和形成过程进行详细分析。

反应器和UHV研究共同为优化催化过程提供了全面的见解。例如，使用聚丙烯酸（PAA）作为模板制备的Pt/Re催化剂导致了更高的重整产物产率、更好的稳定性以及较少的焦炭沉积。这些改进表明，PAA模板影响催化剂表面结构，导致更选择性的脱氢反应。理解这些影响可以指导开发更高效、更耐用的催化剂用于各种应用。

总之，反应器研究和UHV研究对于推进选择性脱氢反应领域至关重要。它们提供了化学过程的全面视图，允许对催化剂设计和反应条件进行精炼，以最大化产率并减少不必要的副反应。
