Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, the study highlights the importance of catalyst selection and characterization. Reactor studies employing a flow system under ultra-high vacuum conditions were employed to investigate the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and ammonia over various supported catalysts. Techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) were used to characterize the catalysts. Gas chromatography (GC) was used to identify the dehydrogenation products. The findings indicated that the dehydrogenation process was significantly influenced by the type of catalyst utilized. The catalysts were characterized by parameters such as surface area, metal loading, and support type.
