Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They involve the breaking of C-H and N-H bonds, potentially yielding useful chemicals and fuels. Reactor and UHV studies are instrumental in understanding these processes. These studies enable the examination of catalyst behavior under controlled conditions and at the molecular level. Researchers employ various methods, including the use of catalysts on supported substrates and investigation of conditions like temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition. Characterization techniques such as XPS, TEM, and FTIR are vital for understanding catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms. Optimizing these factors aims to increase reaction efficiency and selectivity. UHV studies often concentrate on the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products on catalyst surfaces. Insights from these studies guide the design of more effective catalysts and improvements to existing ones, particularly in applications like ammonia and methanol production, where dehydrogenation reactions are fundamental.
