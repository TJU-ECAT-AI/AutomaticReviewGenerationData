<p>The distribution of by-products in Fig. 13 shows that γ - Al2O3 support results in more higher hydrocarbons formed by polymerization reactions compared to the MgO and Mg(Al)O supports. The latter catalysts produce more CO2, which indicates that the supports help to gasify coke.</p>
<p>A detailed study of the composition and size of individual PtSn metal particles on γ -Al2O3, MgO, and Mg(Al)O has been presented. A method for calculating dispersion from STEM/EDX data for bimetallic catalysts was developed. Dispersion results by this method were in good agreement with those obtained from volumetric chemisorption for PtSn/γ -Al2O3. Poor correlation of dispersion results for MgO and Mg(Al)O supports is attributed to interaction between Pt and MgO (strong metal-support interaction).</p>
<p>The conversion of propane correlates well with the Pt fraction in the metal particles. The most active is a catalyst that contains metal particles with high Pt content; however, some Sn is necessary for increased stability.</p>

1. The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage lies in their ability to convert lighter hydrocarbons into more valuable products. These reactions are fundamental in the production of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels, as well as in the manufacturing of chemicals such as ethylene and propylene. In fuel synthesis, selective dehydrogenation allows for the conversion of methane to syngas, which can be further processed into synthetic fuels. In hydrogen storage, dehydrogenation reactions can release hydrogen from complex molecules, making it easier to store and transport. 

2. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies play critical roles in understanding selective dehydrogenation reactions. Reactor studies involve the operation of laboratory-scale or pilot-scale reactors to mimic industrial conditions, allowing researchers to observe the behavior of catalysts under various reaction conditions. These studies focus on key aspects such as temperature, pressure, flow rates, and reactant ratios, aiming to optimize the reaction parameters for maximum yield and selectivity.

UHV studies, conducted in ultra-high vacuum chambers, are essential for investigating the surface chemistry and dynamics of dehydrogenation reactions. These experiments provide insights into the reaction mechanisms at the molecular level, including the formation of intermediates, adsorption of reactants, and the role of catalyst surfaces in determining product distribution. By combining reactor studies with UHV studies, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Key research methods and characterization techniques typically investigated in reactor studies include mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis, which monitor the composition and yield of products over time. UHV studies employ techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and surface-sensitive infrared spectroscopy to analyze the surface chemistry and structure of catalysts.

Reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of inert gases, are systematically varied to determine their impact on product selectivity and yield. Catalysts are often characterized using techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to assess their morphology, composition, and surface properties.

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the optimal conditions for maximizing desired product formation while minimizing unwanted side reactions. Understanding the detailed mechanisms and factors influencing dehydrogenation reactions enables the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, ultimately leading to improved performance in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage applications.
