Table 5. Summary of Selected Dehydrogenation Reactions over Pt-Based Bimetallic Catalysts
4.2.1 NH Bond Scission
Ammonia is regarded as an important hydrogen-storage medium in a hydrogen economy due to its facile decomposition to produce hydrogen.
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission
The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline.
Current high-temperature dehydration processes lead to sintering and rapid deactivation of catalysts, but by modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal, the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst are maintained.

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is profound. These reactions enable the conversion of complex molecules into simpler ones, facilitating the creation of valuable products like polymers, ethers, gasoline, and hydrogen-rich compounds. The process is crucial for industries aiming to optimize efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance sustainability. 

Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies play pivotal roles in advancing our understanding of dehydrogenation processes, particularly concerning C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. These methodologies involve detailed examination of reaction conditions, catalyst properties, and the dynamics of molecular interactions during the dehydrogenation process.

Key research methods and characterization techniques employed in these studies include impregnation synthesis, batch and flow reactor setups, and a range of analytical tools such as N2 adsorption, TEM (transmission electron microscopy), XRD (X-ray diffraction), TPR (temperature programmed reduction), TPO (temperature programmed oxidation), H2 chemisorption, TEM, XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), AES (auger electron spectroscopy), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), CO chemisorption, XAS (X-ray absorption spectroscopy), ICP (inductively coupled plasma), and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure).

These studies often focus on identifying the most active and stable catalyst compositions, optimizing reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, and reactant flow rates, and characterizing the catalyst's surface properties to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the dehydrogenation reactions. Insights gained from reactor and UHV studies contribute significantly to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic processes, enabling industries to produce desired products with greater selectivity and longevity.

In summary, selective dehydrogenation reactions are fundamental to the chemical industry, driving the synthesis of a wide array of valuable compounds. The integration of advanced reactor and UHV studies with sophisticated characterization techniques allows researchers to uncover the critical factors influencing dehydrogenation, paving the way for innovative catalytic technologies that enhance efficiency and sustainability across various industrial sectors.
