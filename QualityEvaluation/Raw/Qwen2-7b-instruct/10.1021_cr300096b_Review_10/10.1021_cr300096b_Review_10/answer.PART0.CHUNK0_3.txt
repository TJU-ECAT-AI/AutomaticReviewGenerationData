4.2 Dehydrogenation Reactions: "Selective dehydrogenation is important for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage."
4.2.1 NH Bond Scission: "Ammonia is regarded as an important hydrogen-storage medium in a hydrogen economy due to its facile decomposition to produce hydrogen."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "Current high-temperature dehydration processes lead to sintering and rapid deactivation of catalysts, but by modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal, the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst are maintained."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "DFT calculations and UHV studies for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene on PtAu surfaces."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "The effect of bimetallic catalysts on dehydrogenation is also found to be synergistic for cyclohexane dehydrogenation over PtNi/AC."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "Other metals that promote dehydrogenation reactions when alloyed with Pt are Bi, (340) Re, (339) Pd, (342, 343)In, (333) and Fe. (286)"
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "Although small amounts of Fe improve catalytic performance, large amounts of Fe lead to rapid deactivation due to the formation of an iron oxide phase."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "DFT calculations predict that subsurface PtNiPt(111) also binds to unsaturated hydrocarbons more weakly than unmodified Pt(111)."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "The presence of Sn on Pt(111) facilitates the first two dehydrogenation steps that produce benzene, prohibits further decomposition of benzene, and thus increases the selectivity of the dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to gas-phase benzene."
4.2.1 NH Bond Scission: "The results demonstrate that catalysts with Pt content between 7 and 31 mol % exhibit 100% hydrogen selectivity, whereas the corresponding Ni and Pt monometallic catalysts show no activity."
4.2.1 NH Bond Scission: "The addition of Sn on the Pt(111) surface decreases the binding energies of adsorbed molecules."
4.2.1 NH Bond Scission: "This is consistent with experimental observations that PtNiPt(111) is more active for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene than either of the parent metal surfaces."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "The reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels has been proposed as a short-term option of H2 storage."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "Both bimetallic catalysts not only improved the activity but also increased resistance to sulfur poisoning for diesel reforming."
4.2.2 CH Bond Scission: "PtRh supported on ZrO2 was superior to both monometallic catalysts in terms of activity, selectivity, and deactivation rate for gasoline dehydrogenation."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions enable the conversion of complex molecules into simpler ones, facilitating the creation of valuable products like polymers, ethers, gasoline, and the storage of hydrogen. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies are instrumental in understanding these processes. Key research methods involve impregnation, batch processing, and the use of various reactors. Characterization techniques include N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal pulse response (TPR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and hydrogen chemisorption. These studies help in optimizing the conditions for dehydrogenation reactions, such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition, ensuring efficient and selective conversion of bonds. The synergy between different metals in bimetallic catalysts enhances their activity, selectivity, and stability, making them highly effective in dehydrogenation reactions. Metals like tin (Sn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and others when alloyed with platinum (Pt), can significantly improve the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts. The findings from these studies provide insights into the design and application of catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and maintain their efficiency over long periods, making them indispensable in industries requiring the conversion of hydrocarbons and hydrogen storage.
