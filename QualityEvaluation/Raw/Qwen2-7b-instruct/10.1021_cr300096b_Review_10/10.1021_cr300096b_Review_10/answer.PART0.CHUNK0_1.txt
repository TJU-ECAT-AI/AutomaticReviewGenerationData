Selective dehydrogenation plays a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Reactor studies and UHV studies significantly contribute to our understanding of these processes, especially focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methods involve the investigation of synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions. These studies help optimize catalytic processes by identifying the most effective catalysts, conditions, and mechanisms for dehydrogenation reactions. The use of supported catalysts, such as Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, is highlighted for their ability to enhance selectivity, activity, and stability during dehydrogenation reactions.
