Selective dehydrogenation plays a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. It enables the conversion of hydrocarbon molecules into simpler compounds, facilitating the creation of valuable products like polymers, ethers, gasoline, and enabling hydrogen release for storage and use. The process is vital for industries aiming to optimize their catalytic processes for efficiency and sustainability.

Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of dehydrogenation reactions. These methods allow researchers to investigate the detailed behavior of catalysts under controlled conditions, revealing insights into the reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and product yields. Key aspects often explored include reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, along with the characterization of catalysts through techniques like N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, and FTIR. These studies help in optimizing catalyst design and operation parameters, leading to enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability.

For instance, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene demonstrates how the addition of metals like Au or Sn to Pt catalysts can reduce the binding energy of adsorbates, enhancing dehydrogenation activity and selectivity while minimizing carbon deposits. Similarly, bimetallic catalysts like PtNi or PtRe can maintain or even improve the activity and stability of dehydrogenation reactions under harsh conditions, making them valuable tools for industrial applications.

UHV studies provide a deeper understanding of the surface chemistry involved in dehydrogenation reactions, elucidating the role of specific metal atoms and their interactions with reactants and products. These insights guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, contributing to advancements in sustainable chemical production and hydrogen storage technologies.

选择性脱氢在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中起着至关重要的作用。它使碳氢化合物分子转化为更简单的化合物，从而促进了聚合物、醚等产品的生成，并使氢释放以供存储和使用。这一过程对于寻求提高催化过程效率和可持续性的工业具有重要意义。

反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究对理解脱氢反应提供了重要见解。这些方法允许研究人员在受控条件下研究催化剂的行为，揭示反应机制、动力学和产物产率的细节。研究的关键方面通常包括温度、压力和原料组成等反应条件，以及通过N2吸附、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、X射线衍射（XRD）、TPR、TPO、H2化学吸附和FTIR等技术对催化剂进行表征。这些研究有助于优化催化剂设计和操作参数，从而提高选择性、活性和稳定性。

例如，将Au或Sn添加到Pt催化剂中以脱氢环己烯转化为苯，可以降低吸附剂的结合能，增强脱氢活性和选择性，同时减少碳沉积。同样，PtNi或PtRe等双金属催化剂可以在恶劣条件下维持甚至改善脱氢反应的活动性和稳定性，成为工业应用中的宝贵工具。

UHV研究为理解脱氢反应涉及的表面化学提供了深入见解，阐明了特定金属原子及其与反应物和产物相互作用的作用。这些洞察指导开发更高效、选择性更强的催化剂，推动了可持续化学生产和氢储存技术的进步。
