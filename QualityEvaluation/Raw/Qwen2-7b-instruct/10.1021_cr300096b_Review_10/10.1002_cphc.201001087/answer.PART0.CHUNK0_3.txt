[2] "This clearly demonstrates that the sur- face alloys represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of these species."

[9] "The floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surf- actant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111)."
[10] "Based on these data, considering only exchange between the surface layer and the subsurface region consisting of the second (bulk dissolution inhibited) and using the annealing temperatures of 1350 K and 1150 K, respectively, the probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann approach given by Equation (1): pbury = exp(DEseg/kBT)."

The document discusses the stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys through a series of experiments and comparisons. The authors found that these surface alloys represent stable configurations, metastable only towards bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for the surface segregation of Pd and Pt species. The floating behavior of these species during the preparation process was studied in detail. The results of these studies were compared with previous mechanistic predictions to understand the surface alloy formation process. The structural characterization of the surface alloys was conducted, and their stability was assessed by comparing their structures before and after the deposition of a Ru film. The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step was consistent with previous reports. The floating of buried metal species during growth processes was also noted. The probability of the metal species being dissolved in the subsurface region during surface alloy formation was estimated using a Boltzmann approach. These findings apply to a wide range of compositions and can be generalized to other surface alloys with negative surface segregation energies.

文档讨论了PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)单层表面合金的稳定性和同质化行为，通过一系列实验和比较进行了研究。作者发现这些表面合金确实代表了稳定的配置，仅在向熵驱动的体溶解过渡时不稳定，并且存在明显的驱动力使得Pd和Pt物种在表面区域同质化。对这些物种在准备过程中的浮动行为进行了详细的研究。这些结果与先前的机制预测进行了比较，以理解表面合金形成过程。对表面合金的结构进行了表征，并通过比较它们在沉积Ru薄膜前后的情况来评估其稳定性。初始沉积步骤期间的岛屿生长行为与之前的报告一致。在生长过程中埋藏金属物种的浮动也被注意到。使用Boltzmann方法估计了金属物种在表面合金形成期间在亚表面区域溶解的概率。这些发现适用于各种组成范围，并可以推广到具有负表面同质化能的其他表面合金。
