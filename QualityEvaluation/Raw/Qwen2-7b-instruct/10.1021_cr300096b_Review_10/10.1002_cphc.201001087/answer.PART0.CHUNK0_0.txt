[1] "Since these findings represent general properties of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, they are representative for a wide range of compositions."
[2] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above."
[3] "Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfactant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111)[4042] or during deposition of various metals on Ag,[4350] Au,[5153] and Cu[49,5457] single crystals."
[4] "The floating behavior is driven by a negative impurity segregation energy,which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the respective other species as well as the size mismatch between the host metal and the comparably larger impurity metal."
[5] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
[6] "Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions."
[7] "The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously.[6,14,29,36,60]"
[8] "After surface alloy formation, the surface morphology has changed in a characteristic way, including the formation of rounded monolayer islands or, on smaller terraces, the attachment at ascending steps (Figure 1b, Figure 2b), in full agreement with previous observations.[29,36]"
[9] "After deposition of 0.44 ML [I(PdMNN)/ I(RuMNN)=0.33, Figure 3e], annealing at 1150 K results in a Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) surface alloy with no measurable Pd loss due to bulk diffusion or desorption [I(PdMNN)/I(RuMNN)=0.33, Figure 3 f]."
[10] "The AES results confirm the findings of the STM measurements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the original surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step."

The study investigates the stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys. By overgrowing the equilibrated surface alloys with a Ru film and subsequent annealing, the researchers demonstrated that after the second annealing step, the outermost surface layer transforms back into the initial PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys. This confirms that the surface alloys represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions. The observation of distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

本研究探讨了单层PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金的稳定性和同位素行为。通过在平衡表面合金上沉积Ru薄膜并随后退火，研究人员证明，在第二次退火步骤之后，外层表面层转变为最初的PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金。这证实了表面合金确实代表了稳定的表面配置，仅在熵驱动的溶解方向上不稳定，并且存在明显的驱动力使Pd和Pt客体元素在Ru(0001)亚表面区域向表面层聚集。Pd含量较低，后一种表面合金中组件的二维分布不同，与Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)相比，有更多的Ru3表面位点，或者Ru与Ru之间的结合力与Ru与Pd之间的结合力之间的差异较小，这可能是500 K时Ru在Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)表面合金上的双层岛生长与相同条件下Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)上的层状Ru生长之间的区别原因。
