[1] "Whereas for Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), the islands exhibit a typical layer-by-layer growth, with the first layer of Ru islands almost filled and the second layer beginning to be populated, Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) shows a distinct growth of bilayer islands."
[2] "Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111)[4042] or during deposition of various metals on Ag,[4350] Au,[5153] and Cu[49,5457] single crystals."
[3] "After surface alloy formation, the surface morphology has changed in a characteristic way, including the formation of rounded monolayer islands or, on smaller terraces, the attachment at ascending steps (Figure 1b, Figure 2b), in full agreement with previous observations."
[4] "Hence, the AES results confirm the findings of the STM measurements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the original surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step."
[5] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."

1. The islands of the Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) exhibit a layer-by-layer growth pattern, whereas those of Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) show a distinctive growth of bilayer islands. 
2. The floating behavior of buried metal species was observed in surface growth processes like Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111), deposition of metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals.
3. After surface alloy formation, the surface morphology typically includes the creation of rounded monolayer islands or attachment at ascending steps on smaller terraces.
4. AES measurements confirm the STM findings, indicating a nearly complete restoration of the original surface alloy composition post-Ru deposition and re-alloying, suggesting complete segregation of buried metals to the surface layer, with a minor loss of Pt during re-alloying.
5. The varying stability of surface alloys is attributed to the lower Pd content (44%) compared to Pt (70%) in the alloy composition.

1. 在Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)中，岛屿表现出层状生长模式，而在Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)中，则显示出独特的双层岛屿增长。
2. 在表面生长过程中，如Ag在Sb/Ag(111)上的同质外延，以及在Ag、Au和Cu单晶上沉积金属时，观察到了埋藏金属物种的浮动行为。
3. 表面合金形成后，表面形态通常包括形成圆润的一层岛屿或在较小台阶上附着于上升步骤。
4. AES测量结果确认了STM测量的结果，表明在Ru沉积和随后重新合金化后，原始表面合金组成几乎完全恢复，这暗示了埋藏金属几乎完全分离到表面层，并且在重新合金化过程中Pt有轻微损失。
5. 表面合金稳定性差异的原因在于合金组成中Pd含量（44%）比Pt（70%）低。
