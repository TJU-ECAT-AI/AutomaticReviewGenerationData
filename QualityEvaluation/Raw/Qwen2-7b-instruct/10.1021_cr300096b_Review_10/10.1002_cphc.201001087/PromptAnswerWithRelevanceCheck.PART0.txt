[1] "Since these findings represent general properties of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, they are representative for a wide range of compositions."
[2] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above."
[3] "Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfactant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111)[4042] or during deposition of various metals on Ag,[4350] Au,[5153] and Cu[49,5457] single crystals."
[4] "The floating behavior is driven by a negative impurity segregation energy,which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the respective other species as well as the size mismatch between the host metal and the comparably larger impurity metal."
[5] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
[6] "Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions."
[7] "The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously.[6,14,29,36,60]"
[8] "After surface alloy formation, the surface morphology has changed in a characteristic way, including the formation of rounded monolayer islands or, on smaller terraces, the attachment at ascending steps (Figure 1b, Figure 2b), in full agreement with previous observations.[29,36]"
[9] "After deposition of 0.44 ML [I(PdMNN)/ I(RuMNN)=0.33, Figure 3e], annealing at 1150 K results in a Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) surface alloy with no measurable Pd loss due to bulk diffusion or desorption [I(PdMNN)/I(RuMNN)=0.33, Figure 3 f]."
[10] "The AES results confirm the findings of the STM measurements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the original surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step."

The study investigates the stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys. By overgrowing the equilibrated surface alloys with a Ru film and subsequent annealing, the researchers demonstrated that after the second annealing step, the outermost surface layer transforms back into the initial PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys. This confirms that the surface alloys represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions. The observation of distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

本研究探讨了单层PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金的稳定性和同位素行为。通过在平衡表面合金上沉积Ru薄膜并随后退火，研究人员证明，在第二次退火步骤之后，外层表面层转变为最初的PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金。这证实了表面合金确实代表了稳定的表面配置，仅在熵驱动的溶解方向上不稳定，并且存在明显的驱动力使Pd和Pt客体元素在Ru(0001)亚表面区域向表面层聚集。Pd含量较低，后一种表面合金中组件的二维分布不同，与Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)相比，有更多的Ru3表面位点，或者Ru与Ru之间的结合力与Ru与Pd之间的结合力之间的差异较小，这可能是500 K时Ru在Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)表面合金上的双层岛生长与相同条件下Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)上的层状Ru生长之间的区别原因。

1. The stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were investigated by STM imaging and AES measurements. The results confirmed that these surface alloys are stable configurations, metastable only towards bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species.

2. The floating behavior of buried metal species was observed in surface alloys formed by depositing a 12 ML Ru film on top and subsequent annealing to temperatures required for initial surface alloy formation. This indicates that the surface alloys represent stable configurations.

3. The floating of buried metal species was attributed to a negative impurity segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the respective other species as well as the size mismatch between the host metal and the comparably larger impurity metal.

4. The re-alloying process after overgrowth by Ru film restored the original surface alloy composition, indicating complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, with a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step.

5. The exchange processes involved in the floating of buried metal species may involve and be assisted by vacancies or fluctuating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed subsurface layer.

6. The formation of surface alloys and their recovery after overgrowth by Ru can both be explained by exchange processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms in combination with a preferential overgrowth of Ru areas as opposed to Pt- or Pd-containing or dominated regions.

7. The findings regarding the stability and segregation behavior of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys are representative for a wide range of compositions and are generic for many surface alloys stabilized by a sufficiently negative surface segregation energy of guest metal atoms within the subsurface or bulk region of the host metal.

1. 通过STM成像和AES测量，研究了PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)单层表面合金的稳定性和同质化行为。结果证实这些表面合金是稳定的配置，仅在排除溶解时才具有热力学稳定性，且存在明显的驱动力促进Pd和Pt客体元素在Ru(0001)次表面区域的表面同质化。

2. 在表面合金形成后，在顶部沉积12 ML Ru薄膜并随后退火到初始表面合金形成所需的温度下观察到了金属物种的浮动行为，这表明表面合金代表了稳定的配置。

3. 观察到的埋藏金属物种的浮动行为归因于负杂质分离能，包括上浮材料的表面能较低以及与宿主金属相比较大杂质金属的尺寸差异。

4. 在Ru薄膜过生长之后进行重新合金化的过程恢复了原始表面合金组成，表明埋藏的Pd（Pt）完全同质化到表面层，并在重新合金化步骤中轻微丢失了Pt。

5. 在覆盖合金化次表面层的Ru薄膜上的浮动埋藏金属物种的交换过程可能涉及并受到空位或波动孔缺陷的影响。

6. 表面合金的形成及其在过生长Ru薄膜后的恢复可以由吸附原子和底层表面原子之间的交换过程解释，结合了相对于Pt-或Pd-含或主导区域优先过生长Ru区域。

7. 有关PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金稳定性和同质化行为的发现适用于各种组成，并且对于许多由宿主金属的次表面或内部区域中客体金属原子足够负的表面分离能量稳定化的表面合金是通用的。

The study of surface alloys, specifically PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001), involves utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These techniques allow for the investigation of the stability and segregation behavior of these alloys. STM provides atomic resolution imaging, enabling the identification of different surface species, while AES measures the elemental composition of the surface layers. The floating effect, where buried metal species rise to the surface layer, is attributed to a negative segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material relative to the host metal and the size mismatch between the host and the impurity metal. The distinct growth behavior of Ru on different surface alloys can be attributed to factors such as the lower Pd content, the unique 2D distribution of components, and differences in bonding strength between the metals. These findings are applicable to a broad range of compositions within this class of surface alloys.

对表面合金，特别是PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)，的研究涉及使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和阿格电子光谱（AES）。这些技术允许我们研究这些合金的稳定性和分层行为。STM提供原子分辨率成像，使得可以识别不同的表面物种，而AES测量了表面层的元素组成。浮动效应，即埋藏的金属物种上升到表面层的现象，归因于一个负的分层能量，其中包括上升材料的表面能相对于宿主金属较低以及宿主与杂质金属之间的尺寸差异。不同表面合金上Ru的不同生长行为可能归因于钯含量较低、成分的独特二维分布以及金属间结合力强度的不同。这些发现适用于这一类表面合金中的广泛组成范围。

The document discusses the stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys through a series of experiments and comparisons. The authors found that these surface alloys represent stable configurations, metastable only towards bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for the surface segregation of Pd and Pt species. The floating behavior of these species during the preparation process was studied in detail. The results of these studies were compared with previous mechanistic predictions to understand the surface alloy formation process. The structural characterization of the surface alloys was conducted, and their stability was assessed by comparing their structures before and after the deposition of a Ru film. The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step was consistent with previous reports. The floating of buried metal species during growth processes was also noted. The probability of the metal species being dissolved in the subsurface region during surface alloy formation was estimated using a Boltzmann approach. These findings apply to a wide range of compositions and can be generalized to other surface alloys with negative surface segregation energies.
