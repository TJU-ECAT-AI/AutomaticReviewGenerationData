[1] "The stability of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys and the tendency for surface segregation of Pd and Pt subsurface guest metals in these surface alloys is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
[2] "Atomic resolution STM imaging and AES measurements reveal that upon overgrowing the surface alloys with a 12 monolayer Ru film and subsequent annealing to the temperatures required for initial surface alloy formation, the Ru-covered Pd (Pt) atoms float back to the outermost layer."
[3] "Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surface surfactant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals."
[4] "The floating behavior is driven by a negative impurity segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the respective other species as well as the size mismatch between the host metal and the comparably larger impurity metal."
[5] "The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content, the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding."
[6] "Since these findings represent general properties of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, they are representative for a wide range of compositions."

The study of surface alloys, specifically PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001), involves utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These techniques allow for the investigation of the stability and segregation behavior of these alloys. STM provides atomic resolution imaging, enabling the identification of different surface species, while AES measures the elemental composition of the surface layers. The floating effect, where buried metal species rise to the surface layer, is attributed to a negative segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material relative to the host metal and the size mismatch between the host and the impurity metal. The distinct growth behavior of Ru on different surface alloys can be attributed to factors such as the lower Pd content, the unique 2D distribution of components, and differences in bonding strength between the metals. These findings are applicable to a broad range of compositions within this class of surface alloys.

对表面合金，特别是PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)，的研究涉及使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和阿格电子光谱（AES）。这些技术允许我们研究这些合金的稳定性和分层行为。STM提供原子分辨率成像，使得可以识别不同的表面物种，而AES测量了表面层的元素组成。浮动效应，即埋藏的金属物种上升到表面层的现象，归因于一个负的分层能量，其中包括上升材料的表面能相对于宿主金属较低以及宿主与杂质金属之间的尺寸差异。不同表面合金上Ru的不同生长行为可能归因于钯含量较低、成分的独特二维分布以及金属间结合力强度的不同。这些发现适用于这一类表面合金中的广泛组成范围。
