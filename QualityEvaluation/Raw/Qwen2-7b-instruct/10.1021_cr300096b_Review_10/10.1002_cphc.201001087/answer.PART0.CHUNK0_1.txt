<p>For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration.</p>
<p>Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above.</p>
<p>Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions.</p>
<p>After surface alloy formation, the surface morphology has changed in a characteristic way, including the formation of rounded monolayer islands or, on smaller terraces, the attachment at ascending steps (Figure 1b, Figure 2b), in full agreement with previous observations.</p>
<p>Hence, the AES results confirm the findings of the STM measurements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the original surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subsequent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step.</p>
<p>Though we have no direct evidence for that, these exchange processes may involve and be assisted by vacancies or fluctuating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed subsurface layer, as predicted previously for vertical surfactant transport.</p>
<p>At the respective annealing temperatures, Ru atoms can detach from the island edges (a), diffuse over the uncovered surface alloy (b) and exchange with Pt atoms in the surface alloy layer (b,c).</p>
<p>Since these findings represent general properties of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, they are representative for a wide range of compositions.</p>

1. The stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys were investigated by STM imaging and AES measurements. The results confirmed that these surface alloys are stable configurations, metastable only towards bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species.

2. The floating behavior of buried metal species was observed in surface alloys formed by depositing a 12 ML Ru film on top and subsequent annealing to temperatures required for initial surface alloy formation. This indicates that the surface alloys represent stable configurations.

3. The floating of buried metal species was attributed to a negative impurity segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the respective other species as well as the size mismatch between the host metal and the comparably larger impurity metal.

4. The re-alloying process after overgrowth by Ru film restored the original surface alloy composition, indicating complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, with a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step.

5. The exchange processes involved in the floating of buried metal species may involve and be assisted by vacancies or fluctuating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed subsurface layer.

6. The formation of surface alloys and their recovery after overgrowth by Ru can both be explained by exchange processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms in combination with a preferential overgrowth of Ru areas as opposed to Pt- or Pd-containing or dominated regions.

7. The findings regarding the stability and segregation behavior of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys are representative for a wide range of compositions and are generic for many surface alloys stabilized by a sufficiently negative surface segregation energy of guest metal atoms within the subsurface or bulk region of the host metal.

1. 通过STM成像和AES测量，研究了PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)单层表面合金的稳定性和同质化行为。结果证实这些表面合金是稳定的配置，仅在排除溶解时才具有热力学稳定性，且存在明显的驱动力促进Pd和Pt客体元素在Ru(0001)次表面区域的表面同质化。

2. 在表面合金形成后，在顶部沉积12 ML Ru薄膜并随后退火到初始表面合金形成所需的温度下观察到了金属物种的浮动行为，这表明表面合金代表了稳定的配置。

3. 观察到的埋藏金属物种的浮动行为归因于负杂质分离能，包括上浮材料的表面能较低以及与宿主金属相比较大杂质金属的尺寸差异。

4. 在Ru薄膜过生长之后进行重新合金化的过程恢复了原始表面合金组成，表明埋藏的Pd（Pt）完全同质化到表面层，并在重新合金化步骤中轻微丢失了Pt。

5. 在覆盖合金化次表面层的Ru薄膜上的浮动埋藏金属物种的交换过程可能涉及并受到空位或波动孔缺陷的影响。

6. 表面合金的形成及其在过生长Ru薄膜后的恢复可以由吸附原子和底层表面原子之间的交换过程解释，结合了相对于Pt-或Pd-含或主导区域优先过生长Ru区域。

7. 有关PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金稳定性和同质化行为的发现适用于各种组成，并且对于许多由宿主金属的次表面或内部区域中客体金属原子足够负的表面分离能量稳定化的表面合金是通用的。
