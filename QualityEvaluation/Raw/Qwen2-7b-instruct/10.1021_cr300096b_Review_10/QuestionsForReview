Analyze the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, and critically evaluate how reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies contribute to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. In your discussion, address the key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions typically investigated, and explain how these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes in this field.
