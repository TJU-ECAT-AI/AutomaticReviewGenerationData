<p>Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED).</p>
<p>At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry.</p>

This study investigates the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy. At 120 K, NO2 adsorbs as an N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom. The dimer dissociates at 300 K, releasing NO2, NO, and O. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to NO and O at 300-400 K. The adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct states, with the lowest related to O2 desorption from Pt sites, and the others from decomposition of reduced tin oxide species, SnOx. AES shifts track the oxidation of Sn.

本研究探讨了NO2在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的吸附与反应。在120 K时，NO2以N,N键合二聚体N2O4的形式吸附到表面上，通过单个氧原子与表面相互作用。该二聚体在300 K时分解，释放出NO2、NO和O。吸附的NO2进一步在300-400 K时分解为NO和O。吸附的氧以三种清晰的脱附状态释放为O2，最低的状态与从Pt位点脱附的O2相关，其余两种则与还原锡氧化物相的分解有关，即SnOx。AES峰的变化追踪了Sn的氧化过程。
