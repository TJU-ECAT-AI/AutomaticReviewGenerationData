This study investigates the adsorption and reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a specific surface alloy, (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1), using various analytical techniques including temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). The key findings include the adsorption of NO2 as an upright NN bonded, N2O4 dimer in a monolayer on the surface alloy at 120 K. The dimer dissociates at temperatures between 220 and 300 K, releasing coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O species. The maximum oxygen coverage reached by heating the N2O4 monolayer is 0.4 ML, and further heating to 900 K results in a film of SnO1.5, indicating partial oxidation of the alloy. The study also highlights the decomposition of NO2 and the liberation of surface oxygen, contributing to the oxidation of the Sn component in the alloy at higher temperatures. 

The selective dehydrogenation reactions discussed in this context pertain to the removal of hydrogen (H) bonds, specifically C-H and N-H bonds, in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Reactor studies often involve controlled environments where reactants are subjected to specific conditions such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst presence to optimize the yield and selectivity of desired products. These conditions are crucial in determining the efficiency of the catalytic process.

UHV studies, on the other hand, focus on the surface chemistry of materials under ultra-high vacuum conditions, providing insights into the fundamental interactions between molecules and surfaces at the atomic level. Techniques like AES, HREELS, and LEED are employed to probe the surface properties, composition, and dynamics of adsorbed species, which is essential for understanding and optimizing catalytic processes. The characterization of surface reactions, such as the dissociation of NO2 and the formation of oxidized species on the alloy surface, informs the design and modification of catalysts for enhanced performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

In summary, the selective dehydrogenation reactions and their optimization are critical in various industrial applications, while reactor and UHV studies provide the theoretical foundation and experimental evidence to guide the development of more efficient and selective catalytic processes. The insights gained from such studies can lead to advancements in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage technologies.

[1] "Interactions of NO2 with metal surfaces are important in many processes, e.g., automotive exhaust catalysis [2] and atmospheric NOx measurement at very low concentrations [3]."
[2] "It has been reported that on alumina, tin is partially oxidized [27] to create a mixed catalyst with a supported alloy phase PtSn/Al2O3 and a tin oxide-supported, Pt-phase Pt/SnOx/Al2O3 [19], where the relative concentrations are determined mainly by particle size [28]."
[3] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."
[4] "This is in agreement with a higher SnO bond strength, which is expected from the known heats of formation (ΔH0f) of tin oxide (SnO, 68.3 kcal/mol; SnO2, 138.8 kcal/mol) compared with platinum oxide (PtO2, +41.0 kcal/mol; Pt3O4, 39 kcal/mol) [48]."
[5] "In this case, oxygen associated with Sn sites after more extensive oxidation reactions corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species. This confirms the previous report that a complete SnO2 film cannot be formed abruptly at the Pt substrate interface, but rather a reduced SnOx interfacial layer (or layers) is required."
