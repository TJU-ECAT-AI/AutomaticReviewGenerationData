The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions lies in their application in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into more valuable products, contributing to energy efficiency and sustainability. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies offer critical insights into these processes, especially concerning C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methods often include computational simulations such as density functional theory and microkinetic modeling, alongside experimental techniques performed under controlled conditions to ensure accurate results. Characterization techniques, such as spectroscopy, are employed to analyze the catalysts' properties and the reaction intermediates. Reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of solvents, are meticulously investigated to optimize catalytic performance. These studies inform the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, enhancing the economic viability and environmental impact of industrial processes involving dehydrogenation reactions.
