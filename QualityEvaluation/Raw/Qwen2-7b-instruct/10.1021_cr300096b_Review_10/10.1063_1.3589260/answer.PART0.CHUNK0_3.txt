The selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage because they enable the conversion of complex molecules into simpler, more valuable compounds. This process is pivotal for enhancing efficiency and reducing environmental impact. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to understanding these processes by providing insights into the mechanisms of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methods include computational simulations such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Microkinetic Modeling, which predict reaction pathways and activation energies. Experimental methods validate these theoretical predictions, often using techniques like X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to characterize catalysts. Reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading, are systematically varied to optimize catalytic performance. These studies collectively inform the design and optimization of catalytic processes, aiming to improve efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability in industries relying on hydrogen production and utilization.
