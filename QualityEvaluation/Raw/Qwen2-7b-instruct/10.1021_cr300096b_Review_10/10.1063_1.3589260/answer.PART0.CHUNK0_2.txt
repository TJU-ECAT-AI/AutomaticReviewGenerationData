The study focuses on understanding ammonia decomposition activity on Fe-Pt, Co-Pt, and Cu-Pt bimetallic surfaces. It employs computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and microkinetic modeling alongside experimental validation to explore the reaction mechanisms and catalyst stability. These approaches contribute to the optimization of catalytic processes involved in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage by providing insights into the selective dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds over supported catalysts.
