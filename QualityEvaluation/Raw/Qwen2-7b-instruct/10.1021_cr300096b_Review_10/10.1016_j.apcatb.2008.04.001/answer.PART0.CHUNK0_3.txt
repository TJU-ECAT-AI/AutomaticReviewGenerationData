Zirconia-supported RhPt catalysts were studied in autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline to produce fuel gas suitable for solid oxide fuel cell applications.
The bimetallic catalysts were superior to monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, and only a small addition of Rh increased the activity of the Pt catalyst markedly.
Moreover, the reforming selectivity and the stability of bimetallic RhPt catalysts against carbon deposition improved with increasing Rh/Pt molar ratio.
Strong synergism between Rh and Pt was observed, leading to excellent catalytic performance.
Based on TPR-, SEM-, and EDX-results a Rh-Pt-O ternary system with RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium is suggested for the bimetallic catalysts, where Rh2O3 is the active site.

The study highlights the use of zirconia-supported rhodium-palladium bimetallic catalysts in the autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline. These catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to their monometallic counterparts, with a small addition of rhodium significantly enhancing the activity of palladium. The reforming selectivity and stability of the bimetallic catalysts against carbon deposition are enhanced with an increased ratio of rhodium to palladium. Strong synergistic effects between rhodium and palladium are observed, contributing to outstanding catalytic performance. The researchers propose the presence of a rhodium-palladium-oxygen ternary system, with rhodium oxide as the active site, based on their findings from temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.

研究着重探讨了在模拟汽油的自热重整过程中，使用锆石支持的铑钯双金属催化剂的应用。这些催化剂在性能上优于单一金属的铑或钯催化剂，仅少量添加铑就能显著提高钯的活性。双金属催化剂的重整选择性和对碳沉积的稳定性随铑与钯摩尔比的增加而改善。铑和钯之间表现出强烈的协同效应，共同促进了优异的催化性能。研究者根据温度程序还原（TPR）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）和能量色散X射线（EDX）分析的结果，提出了一个铑-钯-氧三元体系的存在，其中铑氧化物是催化剂的活性位点。

The performance of zirconia-supported rhodium-palladium bimetallic catalysts was examined in the self-thermally assisted reforming of simulated gasoline to generate fuel gas (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and water) appropriate for solid oxide fuel cell applications. These bimetallic catalysts outperformed their monometallic rhodium and palladium equivalents, with a modest addition of rhodium substantially boosting the activity of the palladium catalyst. Additionally, the bimetallic rhodium-palladium catalysts' reforming selectivity and resilience against carbon deposition improved with a higher rhodium-to-palladium molar ratio.
