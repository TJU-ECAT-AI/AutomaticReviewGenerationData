[1] "The conventional Ni-based catalysts are also very sensitive for sulfur present in commercial fuels."
[2] "However, the thermal stability of the catalyst was improved when Rh was combined with Pt to form a bimetallic catalyst."
[3] "Moreover, the presence of a RhxPt1x alloy is considered a certainty [18]."
[4] "Indeed, bimetallic RhPt catalysts have been superior to monometallic catalysts, suggesting synergism between the two metals [24],[25] and the formation of an alloy [26],[27]."
[5] "The synergism between Rh and Pt on the ZrO2-supported catalysts is discussed and the presence of a ternary Rh-Pt-O system and a RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium in an oxidizing environment [17] is considered."
[6] "The formation of equilibrium between the RhxPt1x alloy and Rh2O3 is possible [17] ,[39]."
[7] "Indeed, RhxPt1x alloys have been classified as near-surface alloys (NSAs) owing to the tendency of subsurface metal layer formation [42]."
[8] "On the monometallic Pt catalyst neither reducible species (TPR, Fig. 1 ) nor orthorhombic crystals (SEM, Fig. 2 ) were detected, consistent with the low reforming activity."

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, this study emphasizes the role of Rh and Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on ZrO2 in autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline. The key findings demonstrate that the addition of a small amount of Rh significantly enhances the activity of the Pt catalyst, resulting in improved selectivity and stability against carbon deposition compared to monometallic Rh or Pt catalysts. The synergistic effect between Rh and Pt is attributed to the formation of a RhxPt1x alloy, which is believed to be responsible for the improved catalytic performance.

The study employs a variety of characterization methods including temperature programmed reduction (TPR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate the surface structure and composition of the catalysts. The reactor studies under autothermal reforming conditions allow for the examination of the catalysts' performance in real-world applications, while ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies provide insights into the detailed mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions.

These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the catalytic processes involved in selective dehydrogenation reactions, informing the optimization of catalysts for industrial applications. The formation of RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium suggests a ternary system where Rh2O3 acts as the active site, offering a potential pathway for enhancing the efficiency and stability of the catalysts.

The research highlights the importance of Rh and Pt bimetallic catalysts in the context of autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline, showcasing the synergistic effects that lead to improved catalytic performance. This work underscores the role of advanced characterization techniques and reactor studies in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of selective dehydrogenation reactions and optimizing catalytic processes in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

分析在化工生产、燃料合成和氢储存中选择性脱氢反应的重要性，本文强调了在模拟汽油的自热重整过程中，铑和钯双金属催化剂在氧化锆支持下的作用。关键发现表明，少量铑的添加显著增强了铂催化剂的活性，导致了与单金属铑或铂催化剂相比，改善了选择性和稳定性，并降低了碳沉积。铑和钯之间的协同效应归因于合金RhxPt1x的形成，这是被认为对改进催化性能负责的。

研究采用了多种表征方法，包括温度程序还原（TPR）、扫描电子显微镜（SEM）、能量色散X射线（EDX）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS），以阐明催化剂的表面结构和组成。在自热重整条件下的反应器研究允许对催化剂在实际应用中的性能进行考察，而超高真空（UHV）研究提供了深入理解脱氢反应机制的细节。

这些研究为选择性脱氢反应的催化过程提供了一个更深刻的理解，为工业应用中催化剂的优化提供了信息。RhxPt1xRh2O3平衡的形成表明存在一个三元体系，其中Rh2O3作为活性位点，这可能为提高催化剂效率和稳定性提供潜在途径。

这项研究突出了在模拟汽油的自热重整过程中，铑和钯双金属催化剂的作用，展示了协同效应带来的改进催化性能。这项工作强调了高级表征技术和反应器研究在阐明选择性脱氢反应机制和优化催化过程中的重要性。
