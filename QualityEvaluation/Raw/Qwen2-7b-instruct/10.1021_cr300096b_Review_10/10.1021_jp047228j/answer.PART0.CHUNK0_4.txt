<p>On both surface alloys, large changes compared to the pure Pt(111) surface are visible in the TPD spectra (Figure 4). First of all, the desorption of molecular cyclopentene (m/e = 67) can be already detected for exposures as low as 0.2 langmuir on both surfaces. This fact is complemented by the absence of any trace of hydrogen desorption. These two results prove that both surface alloys are not active for dehydrogenation and that the cyclopentene adsorption is completely reversible.</p>
<p>Considering the weaker bonding of the molecule on the surface alloys, the question arises whether the bond type of the cyclopentene is also changed on these surfaces. A first indication can be derived from the HREEL spectra that are displayed in Figure 5. Here monolayer coverages of cyclopentene on the three surfaces in question are compared. Already a first visual inspection shows that the main features in the spectra on both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys are very similar to those of cyclopentene on the pure Pt(111) surface. Again the di-σ bonding of the molecules can, therefore, be inferred. However, there is a marked difference between the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface. On the former, the νCH soft mode is detectable at 342 meV, whereas this is not the case for the latter. This observation clearly indicates that there is no agostic (Pt···HC) bonding on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy as on the two other surfaces.</p>
<p>To be able to compare these results with the experimental UP spectrum, the DOS projected on all atoms of the molecule has been calculated and displayed in Figure 13. Four bands are observed, which are centered around 3.9, 5.4, 7.3, and 9.1 eV. These states compare quite well to the experimental spectrum, which is also given in Figure 13 and possesses peaks at 4, 5.5, 7.2, and 9.5 eV.</p>
<p>We now come back to the question of whether the reduced adsorption energies of cyclopentene can be explained by a ligand or rather an ensemble effect. From the afore said and the comparison of the geometries (Tables 2 and 4) of the adsorbate on the three surfaces, it is obvious that the main difference is produced by the difference in the electronic structure of the Pt(111) and the two PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, thus, a ligand effect. This view is also supported by the fact that the energetic difference between the two different configurations Pt3Sn(I) and Pt3Sn(II), a case where an ensemble effect is clearly expected, is only small.</p>
<p>Finally we discuss the issue of the absence of dehydrogenation on the two surface alloys. Two effects can play a crucial role. First, at low coverage on Pt(111) (1/7 and 1/9 ML) the distance Pt3Hβ is small (2.380 and 2.346 Å, Table 2), whereas this distance is much larger on both alloys (Table 4). This already explains why the activation energy for the abstraction of Hβ should be greater on the surface alloys. Second, we have shown previously that for benzene on PtnSn/Pt(111) no chemisorbed species exists. Given the close resemblance of cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) (the dehydrogenation product of cyclopentene on Pt(111)) to benzene on Pt(111), a possible reason for the absence of dehydrogenation can also be the lack of an appropriate adsorption site for the cyclopentadienyl.</p>

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is essential for optimizing catalytic processes. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies provide valuable insights into these processes, particularly concerning C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.

Reactor studies often focus on the kinetics of reactions, the stability of catalysts, and the selectivity towards desired products. These studies might involve monitoring the conversion rates, yield of target compounds, and the efficiency of catalyst utilization. Characterization techniques such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and chromatography can be employed to analyze the products and intermediates.

UHV studies, on the other hand, allow for detailed examination of surface chemistry and the reaction mechanisms occurring at the atomic scale. Techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) are utilized to characterize adsorbates, their bonding states, and the electronic structure changes during the reaction. These studies can reveal information about bond types, activation barriers, and the influence of surface properties on reaction pathways.

Both approaches contribute to the understanding of catalytic processes by providing complementary information. Reactor studies offer practical insights into process optimization, while UHV studies elucidate the fundamental mechanisms behind reaction outcomes. Together, they inform the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, capable of enhancing chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage applications.

In summary, the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions lies in their impact on chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Reactor studies and UHV studies complement each other in elucidating the underlying mechanisms and optimizing catalytic processes. Techniques like HREELS, UPS, and LEED are crucial for detailed surface chemistry analysis, while gas chromatography and mass spectrometry aid in product characterization. The integration of these methodologies facilitates the advancement of catalytic technologies in these fields.
