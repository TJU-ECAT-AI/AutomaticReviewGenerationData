[1] "Adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and the two ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys has been investigated experimentally using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and temperature-programmed desorption as well as theoretically by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[2] "On Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, cyclopentene is di-σ-bonded occupying bridge sites."
[3] "The decrease of the adsorption energy of cyclopentene on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111) can be attributed to the changed electronic structure of the surface alloys and is, therefore, due to a ligand effect."

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage involves understanding the role of catalysts, particularly in the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies are crucial for elucidating the mechanisms and conditions governing these reactions.

Reactor studies often focus on practical applications, providing insights into the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of catalysts under industrially relevant conditions. These studies might involve monitoring the conversion rates of feedstocks, the formation of desired products, and the byproducts generated. Key factors considered include temperature, pressure, catalyst loading, and the nature of the catalyst itself.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer a deeper understanding of the atomic-scale interactions involved in catalytic reactions. Techniques like High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS), Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), and Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) allow researchers to characterize the surface chemistry, bonding, and electronic structure of catalysts and adsorbates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations further aid in predicting and explaining the observed phenomena.

The literature discusses the adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. It reveals that cyclopentene forms a di-σ bond on these surfaces, with specific characteristics like the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond on Pt(111) that facilitates dehydrogenation. The adsorption energy on surface alloys is lower due to the altered electronic structure, indicating a ligand effect. This research contributes to the development of catalysts for efficient dehydrogenation reactions, enhancing the fields of chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

分析选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中的重要性，涉及理解催化剂的作用，特别是在C-H和N-H键脱氢的背景下。反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究对于阐明这些反应的机制和条件至关重要。

反应器研究通常侧重于实际应用，提供有关催化效率、选择性和稳定性的见解。这些研究可能涉及监测原料的转化率、所需产物的形成以及产生的副产品。考虑的关键因素包括温度、压力、催化剂负载和催化剂本身的性质。

相比之下，UHV研究提供了对原子尺度相互作用的深入了解。技术如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）、紫外光电离光谱（UPS）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和温度程序脱附（TPD）允许研究人员表征催化剂和吸附剂的表面化学、键合和电子结构。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算进一步帮助预测并解释观察到的现象。

文献讨论了环戊烯在Pt(111)和有序的Pt3Sn/Pt(111)和Pt2Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附。它揭示了环戊烯在这类表面上形成一个双键，具有特定特征，如在Pt(111)上形成的较弱的Pt3Hβ键，这促进了脱氢。表面合金上的吸附能较低，由于电子结构的改变，表明存在配体效应。这项研究为高效脱氢反应的发展做出了贡献，从而增强了化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域。
