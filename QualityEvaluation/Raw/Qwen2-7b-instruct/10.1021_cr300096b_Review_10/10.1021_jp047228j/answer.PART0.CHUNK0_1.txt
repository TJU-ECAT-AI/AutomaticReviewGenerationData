<p>The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and on the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was investigated experimentally by TPD, UPS, and HREELS as well as theoretically by ab initio DFT calculations.</p>
<p>On Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, cyclopentene is di-σ-bonded occupying bridge sites. A detailed analysis of the adsorption geometry based on the DFT calculation has been presented. It shows in the case of cyclopentene on Pt(111) the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond, which is responsible for the facile dehydrogenation on this surface. This bond is much weaker on both surface alloys, which partially explains the absence of dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111).</p>
<p>The decrease of the adsorption energy of cyclopentene on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111) can be attributed to the changed electronic structure of the surface alloys and is, therefore, due to a ligand effect. The results show a great resemblance to the behavior of ethene on the same surfaces.10,11 This suggests that, due to the similar bonding mechanisms, our results can also account for the chemisorption properties of ethene on the PtnSn(111) surface alloys. They are also related to the behavior of unsaturated aldehydes on the same surfaces.6</p>

The selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to understanding these processes. Reactor studies often focus on the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading, and the product yield, selectivity, and purity. They help optimize the process conditions for efficient and economic operation. UHV studies, on the other hand, provide insights into the molecular-level mechanisms of the reactions, including bond breaking and formation, surface interactions, and the structure of intermediates. These studies use techniques like TPD, UPS, and HREELS to characterize the adsorption, desorption, and electronic states of the reactants and products on the catalyst surface. The DFT calculations complement these experiments by offering theoretical predictions of the reaction pathways and energetics, which guide the interpretation of the experimental data and inform the design of more efficient catalysts.

Key research methods typically include:
1. **Reactor studies**: Use batch, flow, or fixed-bed reactors to mimic industrial conditions and measure the conversion, selectivity, and product distribution.
2. **UHV studies**: Employ techniques like TPD, UPS, and HREELS to investigate the surface chemistry, including adsorption, desorption, and electronic transitions.
3. **DFT calculations**: Provide theoretical insights into the reaction mechanisms, energy barriers, and electronic properties of the reactants, intermediates, and products.

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most effective conditions for the desired reactions, elucidating the specific steps involved, and predicting how changes in catalyst properties or process parameters might affect performance. This knowledge is essential for developing more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly methods for producing fuels and chemicals.
