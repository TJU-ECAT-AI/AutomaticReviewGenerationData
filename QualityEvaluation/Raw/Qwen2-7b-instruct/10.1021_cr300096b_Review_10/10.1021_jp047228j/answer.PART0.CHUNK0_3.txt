[1] "Adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and the two ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys has been investigated experimentally using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and temperature-programmed desorption as well as theoretically by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[2] "On Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, cyclopentene is di-σ-bonded occupying bridge sites. A detailed analysis of the adsorption geometry based on the DFT calculation has been presented."
[3] "The decrease of the adsorption energy of cyclopentene on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111) can be attributed to the changed electronic structure of the surface alloys and is, therefore, due to a ligand effect."

The selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They allow for the conversion of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds into valuable chemicals, fuels, and materials. The processes involve breaking C-H and N-H bonds selectively, often over supported catalysts. Reactor studies focus on the operational conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the catalyst properties, while UHV studies concentrate on the detailed molecular interactions and reaction pathways.

Reactor studies typically involve pilot-scale or industrial reactors where the reaction conditions are optimized for efficiency and yield. These studies consider factors like residence time, flow rates, and catalyst loading. UHV studies, conducted in ultra-high vacuum environments, provide insights into the molecular-level details of the reactions, including adsorption, desorption, and activation energies. Techniques like high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) offer microscopic views of the surface chemistry and the molecular dynamics during the reactions.

These studies are essential for understanding the mechanisms behind dehydrogenation reactions, which can inform the design and optimization of catalysts. They help in identifying the most effective catalysts, understanding the reaction pathways, and predicting the reaction outcomes under various conditions. This knowledge is critical for improving the efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability of the chemical production processes.

In summary, the contributions of reactor and UHV studies in the field of dehydrogenation reactions are manifold. They enable a comprehensive understanding of the chemical transformations, optimize the catalytic processes, and drive innovation in the chemical industry.
