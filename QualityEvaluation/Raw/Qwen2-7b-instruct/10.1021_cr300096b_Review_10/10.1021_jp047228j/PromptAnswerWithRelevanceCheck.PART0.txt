Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage involves understanding the role of catalysts, particularly in the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies are crucial for elucidating the mechanisms and conditions governing these reactions.

Reactor studies often focus on practical applications, providing insights into the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of catalysts under industrially relevant conditions. These studies might involve monitoring the conversion rates of feedstocks, the formation of desired products, and the byproducts generated. Key factors considered include temperature, pressure, catalyst loading, and the nature of the catalyst itself.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer a deeper understanding of the atomic-scale interactions involved in catalytic reactions. Techniques like High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS), Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), and Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) allow researchers to characterize the surface chemistry, bonding, and electronic structure of catalysts and adsorbates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations further aid in predicting and explaining the observed phenomena.

The literature discusses the adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. It reveals that cyclopentene forms a di-σ bond on these surfaces, with specific characteristics like the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond on Pt(111) that facilitates dehydrogenation. The adsorption energy on surface alloys is lower due to the altered electronic structure, indicating a ligand effect. This research contributes to the development of catalysts for efficient dehydrogenation reactions, enhancing the fields of chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

<p>The adsorption of cyclopentene on Pt(111) and on the ordered Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was investigated experimentally by TPD, UPS, and HREELS as well as theoretically by ab initio DFT calculations.</p>
<p>On Pt(111) and both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, cyclopentene is di-σ-bonded occupying bridge sites. A detailed analysis of the adsorption geometry based on the DFT calculation has been presented. It shows in the case of cyclopentene on Pt(111) the formation of a weak Pt3Hβ bond, which is responsible for the facile dehydrogenation on this surface. This bond is much weaker on both surface alloys, which partially explains the absence of dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and Pt2Sn/Pt(111).</p>
<p>The decrease of the adsorption energy of cyclopentene on the surface alloys compared to Pt(111) can be attributed to the changed electronic structure of the surface alloys and is, therefore, due to a ligand effect. The results show a great resemblance to the behavior of ethene on the same surfaces.10,11 This suggests that, due to the similar bonding mechanisms, our results can also account for the chemisorption properties of ethene on the PtnSn(111) surface alloys. They are also related to the behavior of unsaturated aldehydes on the same surfaces.6</p>

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is substantial, particularly in optimizing catalysts and enhancing efficiency. Reactor studies often focus on the practical aspects of the reaction, including the operation conditions, flow rates, and contact times, while UHV studies offer insights into the microscopic details of the catalytic process, such as the adsorption and desorption kinetics of the reactants and products, the structure of the active sites, and the electronic properties of the catalyst surface.

Both types of studies contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic process. Reactor studies provide information on the overall performance of the catalyst, helping to optimize operational parameters for maximum yield and selectivity. UHV studies, on the other hand, enable researchers to dissect the underlying mechanisms, including the nature of the interactions between reactants and catalysts, the pathways of the reactions, and the dynamics of the adsorption and desorption processes. This knowledge is crucial for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

For instance, the dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds over supported catalysts involves complex interactions that can be elucidated through a combination of reactor studies and UHV techniques. In reactor studies, researchers might investigate the effect of temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading on the yield and selectivity of the desired products. Meanwhile, UHV studies can reveal the specific mechanisms of how the catalyst surface affects the bond-breaking reactions, such as the role of surface defects, the nature of the active sites, and the impact of surface chemistry on the reaction pathways.

Characterization techniques, such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low-energy electron diffraction, provide complementary information on the surface structure and electronic properties. These techniques can help identify the specific sites involved in the reactions, understand the changes in the electronic environment upon adsorption, and assess the stability of the active sites over time. Similarly, temperature-programmed desorption studies can shed light on the thermodynamics of the adsorption-desorption processes, which is essential for understanding the reaction kinetics and the regeneration capabilities of the catalyst.

In conclusion, the synergy between reactor studies and UHV investigations offers a powerful approach to unravel the intricacies of catalytic processes involving dehydrogenation reactions. This combined strategy not only enhances our fundamental understanding of the reactions but also drives the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, which are critical for advancements in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage technologies.

<p>On both surface alloys, large changes compared to the pure Pt(111) surface are visible in the TPD spectra (Figure 4). First of all, the desorption of molecular cyclopentene (m/e = 67) can be already detected for exposures as low as 0.2 langmuir on both surfaces. This fact is complemented by the absence of any trace of hydrogen desorption. These two results prove that both surface alloys are not active for dehydrogenation and that the cyclopentene adsorption is completely reversible.</p>
<p>Considering the weaker bonding of the molecule on the surface alloys, the question arises whether the bond type of the cyclopentene is also changed on these surfaces. A first indication can be derived from the HREEL spectra that are displayed in Figure 5. Here monolayer coverages of cyclopentene on the three surfaces in question are compared. Already a first visual inspection shows that the main features in the spectra on both PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys are very similar to those of cyclopentene on the pure Pt(111) surface. Again the di-σ bonding of the molecules can, therefore, be inferred. However, there is a marked difference between the Pt3Sn/Pt(111) and the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface. On the former, the νCH soft mode is detectable at 342 meV, whereas this is not the case for the latter. This observation clearly indicates that there is no agostic (Pt···HC) bonding on the Pt2Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy as on the two other surfaces.</p>
<p>To be able to compare these results with the experimental UP spectrum, the DOS projected on all atoms of the molecule has been calculated and displayed in Figure 13. Four bands are observed, which are centered around 3.9, 5.4, 7.3, and 9.1 eV. These states compare quite well to the experimental spectrum, which is also given in Figure 13 and possesses peaks at 4, 5.5, 7.2, and 9.5 eV.</p>
<p>We now come back to the question of whether the reduced adsorption energies of cyclopentene can be explained by a ligand or rather an ensemble effect. From the afore said and the comparison of the geometries (Tables 2 and 4) of the adsorbate on the three surfaces, it is obvious that the main difference is produced by the difference in the electronic structure of the Pt(111) and the two PtnSn/Pt(111) surface alloys, thus, a ligand effect. This view is also supported by the fact that the energetic difference between the two different configurations Pt3Sn(I) and Pt3Sn(II), a case where an ensemble effect is clearly expected, is only small.</p>
<p>Finally we discuss the issue of the absence of dehydrogenation on the two surface alloys. Two effects can play a crucial role. First, at low coverage on Pt(111) (1/7 and 1/9 ML) the distance Pt3Hβ is small (2.380 and 2.346 Å, Table 2), whereas this distance is much larger on both alloys (Table 4). This already explains why the activation energy for the abstraction of Hβ should be greater on the surface alloys. Second, we have shown previously that for benzene on PtnSn/Pt(111) no chemisorbed species exists. Given the close resemblance of cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) (the dehydrogenation product of cyclopentene on Pt(111)) to benzene on Pt(111), a possible reason for the absence of dehydrogenation can also be the lack of an appropriate adsorption site for the cyclopentadienyl.</p>

Techniques such as high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) are utilized to characterize adsorbates, their bonding states, and the electronic structure changes during the reaction. These studies can reveal information about bond types, activation barriers, and the influence of surface properties on reaction pathways.

Both approaches contribute to the understanding of catalytic processes by providing complementary information. Reactor studies offer practical insights into process optimization, while UHV studies elucidate the fundamental mechanisms behind reaction outcomes. Together, they inform the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, capable of enhancing chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage applications.
