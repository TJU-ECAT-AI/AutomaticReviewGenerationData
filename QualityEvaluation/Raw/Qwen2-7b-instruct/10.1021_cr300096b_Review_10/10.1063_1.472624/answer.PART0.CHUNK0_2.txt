This literature focuses on the coverage, lateral order, and vibrations of atomic nitrogen on the Ru(0001) surface. It was authored by H. Dietrich, K. Jacobi, and G. Ertl and published in the Journal of Chemical Physics in 1996. The study contributes to the understanding of selective dehydrogenation reactions over supported catalysts, particularly C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation, through the examination of reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) conditions. Key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions are investigated, providing insights into optimizing catalytic processes in this field.
