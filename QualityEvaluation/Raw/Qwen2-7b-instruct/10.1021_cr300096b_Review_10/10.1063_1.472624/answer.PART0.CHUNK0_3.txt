The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is substantial due to their role in enhancing efficiency and reducing waste. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. These studies employ key research methods such as reactor analysis and UHV techniques, along with various characterization tools for surface analysis. Reaction conditions like temperature, pressure, and substrate concentration are crucially investigated to optimize catalytic processes.
