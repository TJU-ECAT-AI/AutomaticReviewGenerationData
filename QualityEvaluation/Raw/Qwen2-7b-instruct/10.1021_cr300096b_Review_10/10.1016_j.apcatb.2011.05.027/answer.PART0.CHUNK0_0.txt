<p>The current work focuses on studying the reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends.</p>
<p>There has been extensive research on the reforming of conventional transportation fuels of gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel and additionally there are many published studies on the reforming of pure ethanol, however, literature on ethanol-gasoline blends is limited.</p>
<p>In this paper deactivation, regeneration and stability of a Rh/Pt catalyst on a zirconia containing carrier is studied for the steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends at an energy efficient condition with steam/fuel ratio's slightly higher than stoichiometric (steam/carbon = 1.8) and with temperatures at or near 650 C.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to understand catalyst deactivation in order to develop a process for reforming E85 at less energy intensive conditions. The process of regeneration and preemptive air treatment is studied as a method for maintaining catalyst stability.</p>
<p>Aging tests were performed with sulfur-free E85 under two sets of experimental conditions where the space velocities and catalyst loadings differed.</p>
<p>At both the low and high space velocity condition a steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained.</p>
<p>Under high space velocity conditions the catalyst was not stable reforming E85 with or without sulfur.</p>
<p>The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible.</p>
<p>Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration.</p>
<p>A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel.</p>
<p>XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments.</p>

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes. Studies often investigate key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions to understand these processes better. For instance, reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies play pivotal roles in elucidating the mechanisms of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Reactor studies typically involve testing catalysts under various conditions, including space velocity, temperature, and feedstock composition, to observe the conversion rates and product distributions. These studies help in identifying the optimal operating conditions for maximum efficiency and selectivity. On the other hand, UHV studies offer insights into the atomic-scale interactions between catalysts and reactants, providing detailed information about the reaction pathways and intermediates. Characterization techniques such as XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy), and TPO (Temperature Programmed Oxidation) are commonly employed to monitor changes in catalyst structure and reactivity over time. These methods are instrumental in understanding the evolution of catalyst surfaces and the role of deactivation mechanisms. By combining reactor studies with UHV studies, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes, enabling the development of more efficient and sustainable methods for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

In this context, the research on steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends highlights the importance of understanding catalyst deactivation and regeneration. The study demonstrates that a Rh/Pt catalyst can achieve high conversion rates for reforming sulfur-free E85 at low space velocities, with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 hours. However, the presence of sulfur significantly affects catalyst stability, leading to deactivation after 22 hours. The process of regeneration through air treatment is effective in restoring initial activity, albeit with a shorter period of stable performance following each regeneration. This finding underscores the complexity of deactivation mechanisms and the need for preemptive regeneration strategies to maintain catalyst stability over extended operation times. XPS studies reveal that a shift in the oxidation state of precious metals occurs during continuous exposure to reforming conditions versus with periodic air treatments, suggesting a chemical change that might be associated with irreversible aspects of deactivation.

In summary, the research provides valuable insights into the optimization of catalytic processes for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage by elucidating the dynamics of dehydrogenation reactions, catalyst deactivation, and regeneration mechanisms. The methodologies employed, including reactor and UHV studies, along with advanced characterization techniques, are crucial for advancing our understanding and improving the efficiency and sustainability of these processes.

在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域中，选择性脱氢反应的重要性对于优化催化过程至关重要。研究通常会调查关键的研究方法、表征技术以及反应条件，以更好地理解这些过程。例如，反应器研究和UHV（超高真空）研究在揭示C-H和N-H键脱氢作用于支持催化剂中的机制方面发挥着核心作用。反应器研究通常涉及在不同的空间速度、温度和原料组成下测试催化剂，观察转化率和产品分布，以确定最佳的操作条件以实现最大效率和选择性。另一方面，UHV研究提供了原子级相互作用的信息，提供有关反应路径和中间体的详细信息。常用的表征技术包括XPS（X射线光电子能谱）、TEM（透射电子显微镜）和TPO（程序升温氧化），用于监测随时间变化的催化剂结构和活性。这些方法对于了解催化剂表面的变化和失活机制的作用至关重要。通过结合反应器研究与UHV研究，研究人员可以获得对催化过程的全面理解，从而促进更高效和可持续的化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储方法的发展。

在此背景下，蒸汽重整乙醇/汽油混合物的研究强调了理解催化剂失活和再生的重要性。研究表明，一种Rh/Pt催化剂可以在低空间速度条件下实现100%的乙醇和汽油到氢气、一氧化碳、二氧化碳和甲烷的平衡浓度转换，至少持续110小时，没有出现失活迹象。然而，硫的存在显著影响催化剂稳定性，导致在22小时内失活。通过空气处理的再生过程能够恢复初始活动，尽管每次再生后失活发生的速率更快。这一发现凸显了失活机制的复杂性和采取预防性再生策略以维持催化剂稳定性并延长操作时间的重要性。XPS研究揭示，在连续暴露于重整条件与周期性空气处理之间，贵重金属的氧化状态发生了变化，这可能与不可逆的失活方面有关。

总之，这项研究提供了对优化化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储过程中的催化过程的全面理解，通过揭示脱氢反应动态、催化剂失活和再生机制的关键见解。所采用的方法，包括反应器和UHV研究，以及先进的表征技术，对于推进我们的理解和提高这些过程的效率和可持续性至关重要。
