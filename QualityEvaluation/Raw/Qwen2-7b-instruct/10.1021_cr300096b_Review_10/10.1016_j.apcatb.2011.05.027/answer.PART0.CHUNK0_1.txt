<p>It has been found that the presence of higher hydrocarbons in a fuel, specifically aromatics, increase deactivation due to carbon deposition.</p>
<p>In addition, sulfur, which is also present in many transportation fuels is a known catalyst poison and typically has a detrimental effect on catalyst stability.</p>
<p>Steam reforming for transportation fuels has mostly been studied for synthetic fuels...</p>
<p>It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene contribute to the deactivation at these conditions by coking.</p>
<p>The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible.</p>
<p>Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration.</p>
<p>A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel.</p>
<p>Key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions typically investigated, and how these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes in this field.</p>
