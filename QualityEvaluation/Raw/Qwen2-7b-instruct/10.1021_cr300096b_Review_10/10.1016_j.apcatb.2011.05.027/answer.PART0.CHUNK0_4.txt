An aging test was performed with sulfur-free E85 under two sets of experimental conditions where the space velocities and catalyst loadings differed. At both the low and high space velocity condition a steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained. For the low space velocity condition and high catalyst loading (washcoat loading 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV 22,000 h−1) it was found that the catalyst reformed the ethanol/gasoline mix to equilibrium product distribution with no change in activity for at least 110 h on stream. 

The sulfur-free E85 was then tested with a lower catalyst washcoat loading (0.015 g/cm3) and higher GHSV (44,000 h−1). The result of a 4 h run at these conditions is shown in Fig. 2. Deactivation was measured immediately upon introducing reactants. After 4 h on stream the ethanol conversion had dropped from 100% to 97% and hydrogen production rates had decreased by 14%.

During the high space velocity test, in addition to the major gas species, C2 species of ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ethane were observed in the effluent. It was reported in previous work that reforming pure ethanol at high space velocity produced both acetaldehyde and ethylene with the same catalyst used in this study at high space velocity conditions.

The reforming of E85 containing 5 ppm sulfur was studied at the low space velocity condition described in Section 3.1 (steam/carbon = 1.8, washcoat loading = 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV = 22,000 h−1). At these conditions, for which no deactivation was measured reforming the sulfur-free fuel, significant catalyst deactivation was measured with sulfur.

The results shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, in conjunction with the XPS and TPO analyses, demonstrate that sulfur promotes carbon formation, since deactivation was not measured under these conditions in the absence of sulfur.

Aging tests at process conditions with sulfur and regeneration were conducted. The catalyst was capable of reforming the sulfur containing fuel to the estimated equilibrium product distribution and full conversion but measured deactivation occurred after some period of time on stream. Regeneration was attempted in atmospheres of: 100% N2, 80% N2/20% steam and 50% N2/50% air.

XPS studies were completed on a regenerated catalyst. The washcoated monolith exposed to reforming conditions for 105 h with sulfur containing fuel was placed in the TGA/DTA where it was exposed to 50% N2/50% air at 650 C. Despite the significant coking which occurred during the reforming condition, and the considerable exposure to sulfur, following the oxidative regeneration XPS results found neither sulfur, nor graphitic carbon on the catalyst surface.

Regeneration conditions could also induce irreversible changes to the catalyst. During air treatment, high surface temperatures are possible when carbon is oxidized from the catalyst surface. It is feasible that these high temperatures during air treatments could cause catalyst sintering which is permanent.

A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel. XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments.

1. Aging tests showed that at low space velocities and high catalyst loadings, the catalyst could maintain stable performance for 110 hours without deactivation. However, at high space velocities, even with lower catalyst loadings, deactivation was observed immediately. This suggests that high space velocities lead to the formation of C2 intermediates like ethylene, which might contribute to the deactivation by coking.

2. The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to significant catalyst deactivation after 22 hours. Despite this, air treatment could restore the catalyst's activity, but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration. This implies that the catalyst undergoes some irreversible changes during the deactivation process, affecting its performance upon regeneration.

3. A preemptive regeneration process allowed the catalyst to exhibit stable activity for 28 hours without showing signs of deactivation. This demonstrates the potential for developing a cyclic preemptive regeneration process that could maintain stable performance at low temperatures and low water-to-fuel ratios.

4. XPS studies revealed that the catalyst's oxidation state of precious metals changes when it has been continuously exposed to the reforming conditions compared to when it receives periodic air treatments. This chemical change might be associated with the irreversible aspects of catalyst deactivation and regeneration behavior.

1. 在低空间速度和高催化剂负载下进行的老化测试表明，催化剂可以在至少110小时内保持稳定性能而不会发生失活。然而，在高空间速度下，即使在较低的催化剂负载下，也立即观察到失活。这表明高空间速度可能导致乙烯等C2中间体的形成，这些中间体可能通过结焦作用导致催化剂失活。

2. 将5 ppm硫添加到燃料中后，催化剂在22小时后发生了显著的失活。尽管如此，空气处理仍可以恢复催化剂的活性，但再生后失活发生的速度更快。这表明催化剂在失活过程中会经历一些不可逆的变化，影响其再生后的性能。

3. 利用预设的再生过程可以使催化剂在28小时内表现出稳定的活性而没有显示出失活迹象。这表明有可能开发出一个循环预设的再生过程，以在低温和低水与燃料比下维持稳定的性能。

4. XPS研究揭示了当催化剂持续暴露于重整条件时与定期接受空气处理相比，其贵金属的氧化状态会发生变化。这种化学变化可能与催化剂失活和再生行为中的不可逆方面有关。
