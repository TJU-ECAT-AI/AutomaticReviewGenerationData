[1] "An accurate nature of PtSn systems is very complicated and still a matter of debate, but any proper explanation of the role of tin in PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts is necessarily related to the oxidation state of tin."
[2] "The addition of tin to Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts notably increases the stability and selectivity for dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, inhibiting cracking and isomerization reactions and coke formation process."
[3] "In this work, well defined supported PtSn catalysts were prepared by surface organometallic reactions and were characterized by TEM, XPS and EXAFS techniques and catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane."
[4] "The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: XPS results show that in supported PtSn catalysts, tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV)."
[5] "Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results performed in this work, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts,prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reactionregeneration cycles, recover- ing the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is crucial in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve breaking specific bonds, such as C-H and N-H, which can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of various processes. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these reactions by providing insights into the mechanisms, kinetics, and thermodynamics. 

Reactor studies often focus on the practical aspects of these reactions, including the influence of temperature, pressure, and catalyst type on the yield and selectivity of the desired products. They help optimize reaction conditions and catalyst design for industrial applications.

UHV studies, conducted under ultra-high vacuum conditions, offer a more detailed view of the atomic-scale processes occurring at the catalyst surface. Techniques such as XPS, EXAFS, and TEM are employed to characterize the surface chemistry and structure of the catalysts. These studies reveal how the composition, morphology, and bonding of the catalysts affect the reaction pathways and product distributions.

In the context of the provided document, the selective dehydrogenation reactions were studied using PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts. The document highlights the importance of tin in modifying the electronic environment of platinum, leading to enhanced stability and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. The EXAFS studies revealed the presence of a PtSn alloy, which dilutes metallic platinum atoms and inhibits cracking and coke formation. The bimetallic catalysts prepared via SOMC/M techniques exhibited remarkable regenerability, retaining their initial activity after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. This finding underscores the potential of these catalysts for sustainable chemical production and fuel synthesis processes.
