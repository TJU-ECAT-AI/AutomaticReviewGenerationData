XPS results show that tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), being the percentage of Sn(0) lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts.
When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt  0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2.
Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications.
Results published by Dautzemberg et al. [18] in the n- hexane conversion reaction, indicate that the bimetallic catalyst contains isolated Pt particles, together with Pt- and Sn-rich alloys; PtSn alloys are supposed to be responsible for the inhibition of the reactions taking place on active sites composed of a relatively high number of platinum atoms,whereas dehydrogenation reactions (which can proceed over small ensembles of Pt atoms) are not affected.

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. 

Reactor studies often investigate key research methods such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize the catalysts. These methods help understand the electronic state, local structure, and activity of the catalysts under reaction conditions. The studies focus on the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and gas composition, which influence the dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer insights into the molecular-level interactions between reactants, catalysts, and products. These studies employ techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to visualize the surfaces of the catalysts and observe the dehydrogenation reactions at the atomic scale. The UHV environment provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of the reactions without interference from other molecules or impurities, leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved.

Together, these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most effective catalyst compositions, conditions, and surface structures for selective dehydrogenation. They guide the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for applications in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, contributing to advancements in clean energy technologies.

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage because these processes enable the conversion of heavy hydrocarbons and ammonia into lighter olefins and hydrogen, respectively. This conversion is essential for enhancing product selectivity, improving energy efficiency, and reducing environmental impact.

Reactor studies often focus on the reaction kinetics, temperature effects, pressure influences, and the effect of catalyst properties on the dehydrogenation rates. Techniques like temperature-programmed reaction (TPR), gas chromatography (GC), and catalytic testing in a fixed-bed reactor are commonly used. These studies help optimize conditions for maximum yield and selectivity.

UHV studies, on the other hand, provide insights into the molecular-level mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. They are particularly useful for understanding the interaction between the catalyst surface and reactants, including the formation and dynamics of surface intermediates. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are key tools in UHV environments. These methods allow researchers to probe the local structure and electronic properties of catalyst surfaces and the adsorbates.

In the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, the key findings suggest that the presence of tin (Sn) in the PtSn bimetallic catalysts significantly affects the reaction mechanism. The tin atoms introduce an electronic effect, leading to an electron transfer from tin to platinum, which alters the surface electronic structure and modifies the catalytic activity. This effect contributes to the enhanced stability and selectivity of the catalysts against cracking and coke formation reactions.

The SOMC/M preparation technique enables the formation of a well-defined PtSn active phase, which remains stable across multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. This is attributed to the strong interaction between tin and platinum, which prevents the degradation of the active phase and ensures consistent catalyst performance. The close interaction between tin and platinum also optimizes the use of the tin promoter, minimizing waste and reducing the environmental impact.

In summary, reactor studies and UHV studies complement each other in elucidating the mechanisms of selective dehydrogenation reactions over supported catalysts. These studies provide valuable insights into optimizing catalytic processes for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage applications.

SOMC/M制备技术使形成清晰的PtSn活性相成为可能，该相在多个反应再生周期中保持稳定。这归因于锡和铂之间强烈的相互作用，防止活性相的降解并确保催化剂性能的一致性。锡和铂之间的紧密相互作用也优化了促进剂的使用，减少了浪费并降低了环境影响。
