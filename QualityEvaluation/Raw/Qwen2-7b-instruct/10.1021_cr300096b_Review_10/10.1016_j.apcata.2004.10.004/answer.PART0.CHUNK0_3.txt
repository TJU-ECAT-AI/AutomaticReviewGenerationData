XPS results show that tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), being the percentage of Sn(0) lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts. 
Tin modified platinum catalysts, always show a decrease of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt, what would be indicative of an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum. 
When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt > 0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2. 
The ensemble of our catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications.

The selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage as they enable the conversion of hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing compounds into valuable fuels and chemicals. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies significantly contribute to understanding these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. 

Key research methods often include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for particle size and morphology analysis, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) for determining the active sites, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for chemical state analysis, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) for local structure investigation. Reaction conditions typically involve high temperatures, specific gas compositions, and controlled pressures.

Reactor studies provide insights into the dynamic behavior of the catalysts under industrially relevant conditions, helping to optimize the catalyst design for efficiency and selectivity. UHV studies, on the other hand, offer a detailed view of the molecular-scale interactions between the reactants and catalyst surfaces, providing a microscopic understanding of the catalytic mechanisms.

These studies collectively inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the optimal conditions for maximum efficiency and selectivity, revealing the structure-reactivity relationships, and guiding the development of more stable and regenerable catalysts. They also shed light on the role of metal-support interactions, electronic effects, and the formation of active sites on the catalyst surface, which are critical for enhancing the performance of catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储中至关重要，因为它们能够将烃类和含氮化合物转化为有价值的燃料和化学品。反应器研究和UHV（超高真空）研究对理解这些过程，特别是支持催化剂上的C-H和N-H键脱氢，贡献巨大。

通常的关键研究方法包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）进行颗粒大小和形态分析，温度程序还原（TPR）确定活性位点，X射线光电子能谱（XPS）进行化学状态分析，以及X射线吸收光谱（XAS），包括扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）进行局部结构研究。反应条件通常涉及高温、特定的气体组成和控制压力。

反应器研究提供了在工业相关条件下催化剂动态行为的见解，有助于优化催化剂设计以提高效率和选择性。UHV研究则提供了分子尺度上反应物与催化剂表面相互作用的详细视图，为催化机制提供微观理解。

这些研究集体告知了催化过程的优化，通过识别在最大效率和选择性下的最优条件，揭示结构反应关系，并指导更稳定和可再生催化剂的发展。它们还揭示了金属-支持相互作用、电子效应和催化剂表面活性位点形成的作用，这对于增强脱氢反应中催化剂的性能至关重要。
