XPS results show that tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), being the percentage of Sn(0) lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts.
When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt  0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2.
Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications.
Results published by Dautzemberg et al. [18] in the n- hexane conversion reaction, indicate that the bimetallic catalyst contains isolated Pt particles, together with Pt- and Sn-rich alloys; PtSn alloys are supposed to be responsible for the inhibition of the reactions taking place on active sites composed of a relatively high number of platinum atoms,whereas dehydrogenation reactions (which can proceed over small ensembles of Pt atoms) are not affected.

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. 

Reactor studies often investigate key research methods such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize the catalysts. These methods help understand the electronic state, local structure, and activity of the catalysts under reaction conditions. The studies focus on the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and gas composition, which influence the dehydrogenation efficiency and selectivity.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer insights into the molecular-level interactions between reactants, catalysts, and products. These studies employ techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to visualize the surfaces of the catalysts and observe the dehydrogenation reactions at the atomic scale. The UHV environment provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of the reactions without interference from other molecules or impurities, leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved.

Together, these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most effective catalyst compositions, conditions, and surface structures for selective dehydrogenation. They guide the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for applications in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, contributing to advancements in clean energy technologies.

分析化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域中选择性脱氢反应的重要性，反应器研究和UHV（超高压）研究对理解这些过程做出了重大贡献，特别是针对在支持催化剂上的C-H和N-H键脱氢。 

反应器研究通常采用关键研究方法，如温度程序还原（TPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和X射线吸收光谱（XAS）来表征催化剂。这些方法有助于理解催化剂在反应条件下的电子状态、局部结构和活性。研究关注的反应条件包括温度、压力和气体组成，这些因素影响脱氢效率和选择性。

UHV研究提供了分子水平上反应物、催化剂和产物之间相互作用的见解。这些研究使用技术如扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和角度分辨光发射光谱（ARPES）来观察催化剂表面及其原子尺度的脱氢反应。UHV环境为无其他分子或杂质干扰的情况下研究反应动态提供机会，从而对参与机制有更深入的理解。

结合这些研究，它们指导催化过程的优化，通过识别最有效的催化剂组成、条件和表面结构来进行选择性脱氢。这些研究促进了化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存应用中更高效和可持续催化剂的发展，推动清洁能源技术的进步。
