[1] "The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: XPS results show that in supported PtSn catalysts, tin is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV). The contribution of Sn(0) with respect to SnTOTAL is lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts. In all tin modified platinum catalysts, our results show a downwards shift of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt."
[2] "This fact would be indicative of the existence of an electronic effect, suggesting that there is an electron charge transfer from tin to platinum."
[3] "EXAFS experiments in PtSn supported samples allow to demonstrate the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms for the higher Sn(0)/Pt ratios, in our case approximately 0.3."
[4] "This PtSn alloy seems to be not active in the dehydrogenation reaction, and would have the mission of inhibiting cracking and coke formation reactions and of cleaning the active phase."
[5] "Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results performed in this work, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts,prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reactionregeneration cycles, recover- ing the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."
[6] "This fact could be assigned to the close interaction between tin and platinum, leading to a well defined active phase, avoiding in this way the waste of the metal promoter that could play a negative role after several reactionregeneration cycles."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage because these processes enable the conversion of heavy hydrocarbons and ammonia into lighter olefins and hydrogen, respectively. This conversion is essential for enhancing product selectivity, improving energy efficiency, and reducing environmental impact.

Reactor studies often focus on the reaction kinetics, temperature effects, pressure influences, and the effect of catalyst properties on the dehydrogenation rates. Techniques like temperature-programmed reaction (TPR), gas chromatography (GC), and catalytic testing in a fixed-bed reactor are commonly used. These studies help optimize conditions for maximum yield and selectivity.

UHV studies, on the other hand, provide insights into the molecular-level mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. They are particularly useful for understanding the interaction between the catalyst surface and reactants, including the formation and dynamics of surface intermediates. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are key tools in UHV environments. These methods allow researchers to probe the local structure and electronic properties of catalyst surfaces and the adsorbates.

In the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, the key findings suggest that the presence of tin (Sn) in the PtSn bimetallic catalysts significantly affects the reaction mechanism. The tin atoms introduce an electronic effect, leading to an electron transfer from tin to platinum, which alters the surface electronic structure and modifies the catalytic activity. This effect contributes to the enhanced stability and selectivity of the catalysts against cracking and coke formation reactions.

The SOMC/M preparation technique enables the formation of a well-defined PtSn active phase, which remains stable across multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. This is attributed to the strong interaction between tin and platinum, which prevents the degradation of the active phase and ensures consistent catalyst performance. The close interaction between tin and platinum also optimizes the use of the tin promoter, minimizing waste and reducing the environmental impact.

In summary, reactor studies and UHV studies complement each other in elucidating the mechanisms of selective dehydrogenation reactions over supported catalysts. These studies provide valuable insights into optimizing catalytic processes for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage applications.

分析选择性脱氢反应对于化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存至关重要，因为这些过程能够将重烃和氨转化为较轻的烯烃和氢气，从而提高产品选择性和能源效率，并减少环境影响。

反应器研究通常关注反应动力学、温度效应、压力影响以及催化剂性质对脱氢速率的影响。常用的实验技术包括温度程序反应（TPR）、气相色谱法（GC）和固定床反应器测试。这些研究有助于优化条件以实现最大产量和选择性。

在超高真空研究中，研究人员可以深入了解脱氢反应分子级机制。它们特别适用于理解催化剂表面与反应物之间的相互作用，包括表面中间体的形成和动态。扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和X射线吸收光谱（XAS）是关键工具。这些方法允许研究人员探查催化剂表面及其吸附剂的局部结构和电子性质。

在PtSn双金属催化剂的背景下，研究表明锡（Sn）的存在显著影响脱氢化机制。锡原子引入电子效应，导致电子从锡转移到铂，改变表面电子结构并修改催化活性。这种效应有助于催化剂增强稳定性和对抗裂解和焦炭形成反应的选择性。

SOMC/M制备技术使形成清晰的PtSn活性相成为可能，该相在多个反应再生周期中保持稳定。这归因于锡和铂之间强烈的相互作用，防止活性相的降解并确保催化剂性能的一致性。锡和铂之间的紧密相互作用也优化了促进剂的使用，减少了浪费并降低了环境影响。

总之，反应器研究和超高真空研究相结合，为理解支持型催化剂上的选择性脱氢反应机制提供了宝贵见解。这些研究为化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存应用中的催化过程优化提供了有价值的洞察。
