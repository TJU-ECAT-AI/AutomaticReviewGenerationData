[1] "The Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst shows promise and has been identified as an active catalyst for the low-temperature hydrogenation of cycloalkenes including cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexeadiene, and benzene [3-5]."
[2] "Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [5-11]."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that for the Pt-Ni bimetallic system, the formation of a subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure with an atomic layer of Ni underneath the surface Pt atoms is responsible for the higher hydrogenation activity of the C=C bond than the corresponding monometallic surfaces [8]."
[4] "A novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on Pt-Ni-Pt has been correlated to the weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes,which resulted from the modification of the electronic properties because of the formation of subsurface bimetallic structures [8,10]."
[5] "In addition to the novel hydrogenation chemistry, surface science studies on the Pt-Ni bimetallic system have also identified a surface bimetallic structure, Ni-Pt-Pt, with a layer of Ni residing on top of the Pt substrate [8]."
[6] "Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface binds adsorbates more strongly than either Pt or Ni surfaces alone."
[7] "The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydrogenation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13]."
[8] "For supported bimetallic catalysts, it is most likely that both the subsurface and surface bimetallic structures are present."
[9] "The consumption of 1,3-CHD decreases in the order Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 > Pt/γ-Al2O3 > Ni/γ-Al2O3."
[10] "The Pt-Ni catalyst also shows much higher production rates for cyclohexane and benzene based on the initial increase in the concentrations of the two products in Fig. 1."
[11] "The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst."
[12] "By comparison, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, which promotes the dehydrogenation pathway."

Analyze the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, and critically evaluate how reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies contribute to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. In your discussion, address the key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions typically investigated, and explain how these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes in this field.

Reactor studies and UHV studies significantly contribute to our understanding of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These studies focus on understanding the mechanisms and kinetics of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methods include the use of supported catalysts in batch reactors equipped with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to monitor the progress of the reactions. Characterization techniques such as CO chemisorption are employed to determine the surface properties of the catalysts, providing insights into their reactivity and selectivity.

Reactor studies involve the use of batch reactors under controlled conditions to assess the catalytic activity and selectivity of the supported catalysts towards dehydrogenation reactions. These studies typically involve the use of specific feedstocks, such as cyclic hydrocarbons, and gases like hydrogen, under defined pressures and temperatures. FT-IR spectroscopy is crucial in monitoring the transformation of reactants into products, allowing researchers to track the progress of the reaction and the formation of desired products.

UHV studies, conducted in ultra-high vacuum environments, enable the investigation of surface science phenomena at the atomic level. These studies often employ techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) to visualize the structure and composition of the catalyst surfaces. The binding energies of adsorbates, such as hydrogen and cyclic hydrocarbons, are determined using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This helps in understanding the electronic interactions between the catalysts and the reactants, providing insights into the activation and deactivation mechanisms of the catalysts.

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most active and selective catalysts for specific dehydrogenation reactions. The characterization of surface structures, such as the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt and surface Ni-Pt-Pt configurations, reveals the critical requirements for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable structures. The understanding gained from these studies enables the design of catalysts with tailored surface properties that enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for desired reactions, thereby optimizing chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage processes.
