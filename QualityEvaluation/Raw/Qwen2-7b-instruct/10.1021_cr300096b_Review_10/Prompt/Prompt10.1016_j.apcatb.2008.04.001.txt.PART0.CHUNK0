Zirconia-supported bimetallic RhPt catalysts: Characterization and testing in autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline Abstract The behavior of ZrO2-supported RhPt catalysts was studied in the autothermal reforming of simulated gasoline to produce fuel gas (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O) suitable for solid oxide fuel cell applications.
The bimetallic catalysts were superior to the monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, and only a small addition of Rh increased the activity of the Pt catalyst markedly. Moreover, the reforming selectivity and the stability of bimetallic RhPt catalysts against carbon deposition improved with increasing Rh/Pt molar ratio.
Strong synergism between Rh and Pt was observed, leading to excellent catalytic performance. Based on TPR-, SEM-, and EDX-results a Rh-Pt-O ternary system with RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium is suggested for the bimetallic catalysts, where Rh2O3 is the active site.
1. Introduction
For energy production, substitution of fossil fuels by H2 is a suitable option for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, in particular CO2. The major advantages of using H2 or H2-rich mixtures, i.e. syngas, as fuel include the diversity of primary fuels (natural gas, biomass, crude oil) that can be used in H2 production, its clean combustion and the possibility of long-term storage of the primary fuel [1] ,[2] . The growing interest in fuel cell technologies in heat and power production and as replacements for internal combustion engines increases the demand for H2 production [3] . The development of an economy based on H2 requires major structural changes that could take several decades. Therefore, commercially available fuels such as gasoline and diesel could be used as near- and mid term H2 carriers to achieve some immediate reduction in green house gas emissions [1] .H2-rich mixtures are industrially produced by steam reforming (SR, Eq. (1) ) of natural gas on Ni catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] . One of the major problems encountered with this process is catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition (Eqs. (2) ,(3) ,(4) ).
(1) (2) (3) 2CO  CO2 + C(s) (Boudouard reaction) (4) CO + H2  H2O + C(s) The reforming of higher hydrocarbons (gasoline and diesel), which contain aromatics, increases the risk of carbon deposition, especially on a Ni catalyst [5] . With higher hydrocarbons, moreover, the SR becomes very endothermic, thus the combination of SR and partial oxidation (POX, Eq. (5) ), known as autothermal reforming (ATR), is preferred. The hydrocarbons react with H2O and O2 in a process where high energy efficiencies are achieved as the exothermic POX reaction provides the heat needed for the endothermic SR reaction. The process is simple in design and requires low monetary investments [7] . The water gas shift reaction (WGS, Eq. (6) ) also takes place and the reaction equilibrium can be shifted with changes in operating conditions: the steam to carbon and the oxygen to carbon molar ratios and the temperature. By optimizing the reforming conditions, moreover, the carbon deposition can be limited [1] ,[2] ,[6] .

The conventional Ni-based catalysts are also very sensitive for sulfur present in commercial fuels. This limitation can be overcome by the addition of a second metal to the Ni catalyst such as Pt or Pd [8] , or the substitution of Ni by these more sulfur-resistant noble metals [6] ,[9] . Rh in particular has shown high resistance to carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning, yielding high conversions of hydrocarbons and high selectivity for H2 [3] ,[10] ,[11] . The material used as the support also affects the catalyst performance [8] . Zirconia (ZrO2) is the preferred support for Rh catalysts in order to avoid the detrimental interaction between Rh and alumina (Al2O3) that reduces the activity of the catalyst [12] . As ZrO2 is less acidic than Al2O3 [13] , thermal cracking reactions and coke formation are reduced [14] . The disadvantage of ZrO2 is, however, the low surface area compared to other supports [12] .
Previously, we presented results on ATR of n-dodecane, toluene, and their mixture on ZrO2-supported noble metal catalysts [15] . The Rh catalyst became deactivated with time on stream. We proposed that the catalyst deactivation was caused by the formation of volatile Rh compounds that vaporized from the catalyst surface at high temperatures, in accordance with the results presented by Bagot et al.
[16] . They reported that the presence of free oxygen atoms drives segregation on Pt-Rh surfaces, causing vertical diffusion of Rh from the second atomic layer to the surface layer [16] . Furthermore, the topmost, Rh-enriched surface appears unstable beyond 300 C, and dramatic Rh depletion is observed [16] , especially if the oxidation of Rh is rapid [17] . However, the thermal stability of the catalyst was improved when Rh was combined with Pt to form a bimetallic catalyst [15] .
Bimetallic RhPt catalysts play a crucial role in simultaneous oxidation of hydrocarbons and CO, and reduction of NOx from automobile exhaust gases. Extensive research has, thus, been carried out on these three-way catalysts [16] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] . However, the behavior of RhPt catalysts has mainly been studied on a theoretical level, using flat, single crystal metal samples [18] ,[20] ,[22] ,[23] , where the presence of a RhxPt1x alloy is considered a certainty [18] . Indeed, bimetallic RhPt catalysts have been superior to monometallic catalysts, suggesting synergism between the two metals [24] ,[25] and the formation of an alloy [26] ,[27] .
In this work, ZrO2-supported mono- and bimetallic RhPt catalysts, with various Rh/(Rh + Pt) ratios, were characterized and tested in ATR reactions of simulated gasoline to better understand the roles of Rh and Pt on the bimetallic catalysts. The synergism between Rh and Pt on the ZrO2-supported catalysts is discussed and the presence of a ternary Rh-Pt-O system and a RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium in an oxidizing environment [17] is considered.
2. Experimental conditions
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The mono- and bimetallic catalysts were prepared by dry impregnation and dry co-impregnation, respectively, using Pt(NH3)2(NO2)2 (Aldrich, 3.4 wt% in dilute ammonium hydroxide), Rh(NO3)3 (Aldrich, 10 wt% Rh in >5 wt% nitric acid), and their solutions. The intended total metal loading on the surface of both mono- and bimetallic catalysts was 0.51.0 wt%. The ZrO2 support (MEL Chemicals EC0100) was ground to a particle size of 0.250.42 mm and calcined at 900 C for 16 h (temperature ramp 5 C/min). After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at room temperature for 4 h and at 100 C overnight. Finally the catalysts were calcined at 700 or 900 C for 1 h (temperature ramp 1.3 C/min).
The mono- and bimetallic catalysts were designated Pt, 0.5RhPt, 1RhPt, 2RhPt, and Rh, where the numbers 0.5, 1, and 2 correspond to the intended Rh/Pt molar ratio of the bimetallic catalysts, respectively. The calcination temperature is indicated in parentheses: (700) or (900).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Metal loadings of the fresh and used catalysts were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Varian-Liberty). The analytical error of this procedure is 5%. For comparative purpose, the metal loadings of the fresh catalysts were measured with a X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Philips PW 1480 XRF) equipped with UniQuant 4software.
BET-surface area and total pore volume determinations were performed with a Coulter Omnisorp 100 CX gas adsorption instrument using static volumetric adsorption and desorption method, where N2 (Aga, 99.999%) was used as an adsorptive gas. The measurements were done for an evacuated catalyst sample (0.1 g) in a liquid-N2 bath at 77 K (196 C). The adsorption isotherm was measured by dosing N2 to the sample and measuring the adsorbed amount as a function of N2 pressure. The H2 (Aga, 99.999%) chemisorption determination was performed with the same equipment in pulses of H2 (15 steps) and the experimental setup is reported in detail elsewhere [15] . The analytical error of these procedures is 10%.
CO (Messer Griesheim, 99.997%) adsorption was studied by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) as reported previously [15] . The experimental setup is described in detail elsewhere [28] .
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) with H2 (Aga, 99.999%) was carried out by Altamira Instruments AMI-100 characterization equipment. The catalyst samples (80 mg) were flushed with Ar (Aga, 99.999%), heated from 30 to 160 C at a rate of 10 C/min, and held at 160 C for 30 min. Subsequently, the samples were heated from 160 to 700 C at a rate of 15 C/min under a flow of 20% O2/He (Aga, 99.996%) and kept at 700 C for 60 min. The samples were cooled to 50 C in 20% O2/He flow. TPR was performed at a heating rate of 10 C/min up to 700 C under a flow (30 cm3/min, NTP) of 5% H2/Ar (Aga, 99.999%). The consumption of H2 was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed with a Philips PW 1710 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) determinations were performed with AXIS 165 by Kratos Analytical.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a LEO 1450 SEM (Oxford Instruments Inca). Secondary electron and back scattered secondary electron detectors were used to record images at several magnifications.
The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements were done with an Oxford INCA 350 energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer connected to a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope.
2.3. Testing in autothermal reforming
A mixture of C7-hydrocarbons was prepared to simulate commercial gasoline. The approximate composition of gasoline varies widely depending on the source and the blending of different refinery streams. In this C7-mixture, toluene (T, Riedel-de Han, 99.7%) was used as the model for aromatics, and n-heptane (H, Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and methylcyclohexane (M, Fluka, 99.5%) were used as models for straight, branched, and cyclic aliphatic fractions of gasoline. The T/H/M molar ratio of the prepared C7-mixture was 20/30/50. The optimized H2O/C and O2/C molar ratios of the ATR feed were 3 mol/mol and 0.34 mol/mol, respectively [10] .
The tubular quartz reactor (inner diameter 10 mm) was packed with 0.2 g of the catalyst and was placed in a three-zone furnace equipped with a temperature controller (Carbolite). The height of the catalyst bed was 3 mm. A pressure test for the reactor was performed with Ar (Aga, 99.999%). Subsequently, the pressure was released and the reactor was heated to 700 C in Ar atmosphere. The C7-mixture (0.051 ml/min(l)) and distilled water (0.149 ml/min(l)) were fed into separate evaporators (300 C) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-pumps, Agilent Technologies) equipped with micro vacuum degassers (Agilent Technologies). The vaporized feed was mixed with synthetic air (20% O2/N2, Aga, 99.99%) before its introduction to the reactor. The total flow rate of reactants was 300 cm3/min (NTP) and the feed was diluted with Ar before the reactor to a total flow of 900 cm3/min (NTP). The catalyst bed temperature and the temperature profile of the reactor were followed with a thermocouple placed inside the reactor.
For comparative purpose, ATR experiments were performed on pure ZrO2 (0.2 g) and without any catalyst (empty reactor). The temperature range examined was 400900 C. The stability of the catalysts was studied at 700 C for 56 h. After the experiment, the reactor was flushed with Ar and cooled down to room temperature. The amount of carbon in the fresh and used catalyst samples was determined with a Leco SC-444, where the carbon was burnt from the sample in O2 at 1350 C. The analytical error of the procedure was 5%.
2.4. Product analysis and calculations
After the reactor, the flows were diluted with N2 (900 cm3/min, NTP) and analyzed using an on-line Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Gasmet) equipped with a Peltier-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector and multicomponent analysis software (Calcmet). The sample cell was kept at 230 C to avoid condensation of the fed hydrocarbons and water. The compounds analyzed were H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2C5 alkenes, C2C7 alkanes, C1C4 alcohols, benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane. After the FTIR analysis, water and higher hydrocarbons were condensed and the dry gas flow rate was measured. The measured values were used to determine the element balances (C, H, and O) and to calculate the amounts of H2 formed and O2 consumed. The conversions of toluene, n-heptane, methylcyclohexane, and water were calculated from the feed and product flows. The weighted average of the conversions of toluene, n-heptane, and methylcyclohexane was calculated to present the overall hydrocarbon conversion:(7) The unreacted reactants and the inert gases (Ar + N2) were excluded from the product distribution calculations (Pi (mol%), Eq. (8) ), where Fi is the molar flow (mol/min) of compound i.
(8) The yield of compound i was defined as the molar ratio of compound i to the total mole amount of carbon in the C7-hydrocarbon feed (mol/mol Cin):(9) The catalyst selectivity for reforming reactions is presented as the reforming to oxidation molar ratio (Ref/Ox, Eq. (10) ). H2 is formed not only in the reforming reactions but also by the WGS equilibrium reaction (Eq. (6) ), thus the production of H2 does not directly reveal the catalyst selectivity for reforming. However, when considering the Ref/Ox molar ratio, the effect of the WGS reaction is eliminated [15] .
(10) Thermodynamic calculations for ATR reactions of the C7-mixture were performed with HSC Chemistry version 5.11 [29] . The effect of side reactions such as the WGS (Eq. (6) ), thermal cracking, and carbon formation reactions (Eqs. (2) ,(3) ,(4) ) was included. Also hydrogenation and dehydrocyclization reactions of the C7-hydrocarbons were studied.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The synergism between Rh and Pt on the bimetallic catalysts was examined with several characterization methods. Also the influence of calcinations temperature on catalytic properties was investigated.
3.1.1. Metal loadings
Metal loadings of the fresh (calcined) and used noble metal catalysts are shown in Table 1 . There was a good correspondence between the ICP-AES and XRF results for the bimetallic RhPt catalysts. However, for the monometallic Rh catalysts, the metal loading determination by ICP-AES gave clearly lower values than was intended (0.51.0 wt%) or determined with XRF ( Table 1 ). The lower Rh concentration obtained with ICP-AES indicated that the Rh from the monometallic catalysts did not completely dissolve in the acid solution used in the determination. This is in agreement with the results reported by Danzaki and Ashino [30] . In the presence of Pt, however, the solubility of Rh improved ( Table 1 ). The calcination temperature (700 and 900 C) did not affect the metal loading.

3.1.2. Physisorption, chemisorption, and DRITFS measurements
The measured BET-surface areas (m2/g), total pore volumes (cm3/g), and irreversible H2 chemisorption uptakes of the fresh catalysts are presented in Table 2 . As expected, the BET-surface area of the ZrO2 support decreased with increasing calcination temperature (600900 C) [12] . A decrease in the BET-surface area, the total pore volume, and the irreversible H2 chemisorption was also measured on catalysts calcined at 900 C in contrast to catalysts calcined at 700 C, indicating a change in the surface structure. The BET-surface area and the pore volume were not affect by the Rh/(Rh + Pt) molar ratio ( Table 2 ), however, neither were the CO adsorption states of the monometallic Rh catalyst [15] affected when Rh was combined with Pt in the bimetallic 2RhPt catalyst (DRIFTS results not presented). Nonetheless, the irreversible H2 chemisorption uptakes of the bimetallic 1RhPt and 2RhPt catalysts were superior to those of the monometallic catalysts ( Table 2 ).

[15] .
3.1.3. H2-TPR
H2-TPR measurements were performed on fresh Rh(700), Pt(700), 2RhPt(700), and 2RhPt(900). On the Rh(700) catalyst, two reduction steps, at 95 and 127 C ( Fig. 1 ), were detected. Similar reduction steps were also found in a study on aged Rh catalysts supported on various materials published by Ferrandon and Krause [31] . On Pt(700), no indication of reducible species was observed, which agrees with the low irreversible H2 chemisorption uptakes ( Table 2 ) and the fact that Pt does not form stable oxides at high temperatures [17] ,[32] . On the bimetallic 2RhPt(700) and 2RhPt(900) catalysts only one reduction step was noticed and the reduction temperature shifted with the calcination temperature ( Fig. 1 ). Moreover, the consumption of H2 was clearly lower with these bimetallic catalysts compared to the monometallic Rh, the A2RhPt(700)/ARh and A2RhPt(900)/ARh ratios in Fig. 1 being 16% and 25%, respectively. If it is assumed that only Rh compounds reduce and according to the H2 consumption and the Rh-loadings determined by XRF ( Table 1 ), only 33% and 50% of Rh atoms were in reducible form on the 2RhPt(700) and 2RhPt(900) catalysts, respectively.

3.1.4. XRD and XPS
The XRD spectra of the bimetallic catalysts showed overlapping of the Rh, Pt, and possible RhxPt1x alloy peaks with those corresponding to ZrO2 making the identification of the species difficult. Subsequently, Rh and Pt peaks were identified in the XPS spectra. Some differences were noticed in the intensities of the Rh and Pt peaks on the mono- and bimetallic catalysts. However, the metal loadings were too low for reliable characterization.
3.1.5. SEM
SEM was used to examine the surface morphology of fresh and used Rh(700), Rh(900), Pt(700), Pt(900), 2RhPt(700), and 2RhPt(900) catalysts. No metal clusters were detected on the surface of fresh Rh(700) and Rh(900) catalysts (data not presented). Thus, either the impregnation procedure was successful and therefore well-dispersed metal particles were obtained, or the Rh particles were encapsulated within the ZrO2 [19] ,[20] . The SEM pictures of the Pt(700), Pt(900), 2RhPt(700), and 2RhPt(900) catalysts showed dispersed metal particles on the surface of the fresh catalysts ( Fig. 2 ). On the 2RhPt(700) and 2RhPt(900) catalysts, moreover, an orthorhombic crystal structure of the metal particles was perceived ( Fig. 2 b).

3.1.6. EDX
EDX measurements were performed on the fresh 2RhPt(900) catalyst. EDX spectra were measured on several metal particles and on the surface of the ZrO2 support. The metal particles of different sizes contained Rh and Pt with an average Rh/Pt ratio of 0.10 mol/mol; the variation being 0.030.19 mol/mol for 34 particles. Moreover, within single particles the variation in Rh/Pt ratio was small (e.g. 0.100.14 mol/mol) indicating homogenous distribution of Rh and Pt metals. The Rh/Pt ratio (0.10 mol/mol) of the 2RhPt(900) catalyst surface (d < 0.51.5 μm) was clearly lower than the Rh/Pt ratio measured for the whole catalyst (2.22.7 mol/mol) ( Table 1 ), the catalyst being strongly Rh-depleted. Nonetheless, Rh or Pt was not found in the support (d < 0.51.5 μm).
3.2. Catalyst testing in ATR of simulated gasoline
The mono- and bimetallic RhPt catalysts were tested in ATR of simulated gasoline at temperatures between 400 and 900 C to get insight on the effect of Rh/(Rh + Pt) molar ratio on catalyst performance. Also the effect of calcination temperature (700 and 900 C) on catalyst performance was evaluated. Short-term stability tests were performed at 700 C for 56 h, and the carbon deposition and metal loadings of the used catalysts were determined. The catalyst sintering was examined with SEM after testing.
3.2.1. Non-catalytic experiments
The involvement of non-catalytic reactions of the simulated gasoline was investigated at ATR conditions in an empty reactor and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . At low inlet temperatures (400500 C), the thermal cracking of simulated gasoline was negligible. The conversions of n-heptane, methylcyclohexane, and oxygen increased with temperature, and complete decomposition of aliphatic hydrocarbons was reached at the inlet temperature of 750 C. This is in agreement with thermal cracking experiments of the individual hydrocarbons reported in our earlier study [10] . In the temperature range 500700 C dehydrocyclization of n-heptane or the reaction of methylcyclohexane to toluene and H2 took place, in agreement with thermodynamic calculations. The formation of toluene was highest at 700 C ( Fig. 3 ). Beyond 700 C toluene started to react and at 900 C almost complete decomposition was obtained ( Fig. 3 ). The product distribution at 700 C is included in Table 3 . The negative value obtained for the water conversion at 700900 C and the sharp increase in oxygen consumption ( Fig. 3 ) indicated formation of water by complete oxidation (OX) reactions.

3.2.2. Comparison of mono- and bimetallic RhPt catalysts
The hydrocarbon and water conversions in ATR of simulated gasoline on the mono- and bimetallic RhPt catalysts are presented in Fig. 4 a and b, respectively. The conversions obtained with the bimetallic catalysts were between the conversions obtained with monometallic Rh and Pt. As expected [15] , the conversion of water was highest on Rh, and the maximum value was reached at 700 C. At 700 C, moreover, complete hydrocarbon conversions were obtained on all the Rh-containing mono- and bimetallic catalysts ( Fig. 4 a), whereas the activity of Pt was low. Thus, only a small addition of Rh was sufficient to improve the performance of bimetallic catalysts over that of monometallic Pt. The Rh/Pt ratio of the bimetallic catalysts had no effect on the catalyst activity, as the hydrocarbon conversion was equal on all the bimetallic catalysts calcined at 900 C ( Fig. 4 a). On catalysts calcined at 700 C, slight differences in the catalyst activities were noticed (data not reported). Thus, the higher calcination temperature equalized the bimetallic RhPt catalysts.

H2O/C = 3 mol/mol, O2/C = 0.34 mol/mol.
On all noble metal catalysts, the conversion of oxygen was complete in the entire temperature range tested (inlet temperature 400900 C), revealing activity for oxidation reactions (i.e. POX and OX), whereas on the support the consumption of oxygen increased with temperature and complete conversion was reached at 850 C.
Table 3 compares the product distributions obtained on the mono- and bimetallic RhPt catalysts in ATR of simulated gasoline at inlet temperature of 700 C. For comparative purpose, also the thermodynamic equilibrium of the products and results on ZrO2 and in non-catalytic experiments are presented. Although the pure support does not catalyze the reforming reactions [15] the selectivity for COx ( Table 3 ) improved on ZrO2 when compared to non-catalytic experiments, revealing some catalytic behavior. Indeed, oxidation reactions were taking place on ZrO2 as water was formed more than consumed. The presence of Pt increased the H2 production, but thermal cracking products were still formed, correlating with the low reforming activity. On all Rh-containing mono- and bimetallic catalysts, the product distribution was close to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, the low concentrations of light hydrocarbons (C1C4-hydrocarbons designated as others in Table 3 ) indicated the limited extent of thermal cracking reactions and high reforming activity for all Rh-containing catalysts [10] .The WGS reaction (Eq. (6) ) clearly affected the product distribution on Rh-containing catalysts, as is observed, e.g. from the product yields obtained on 2RhPt(900) ( Fig. 5 ), whereas on Pt the conversion of H2O and CO to H2 and CO2 remained lower ( Table 3 ). The contribution of WGS was neglected in the Ref/Ox ratio (Eq. (10) ), which is presented in Fig. 6 as the function of intended Rh/(Rh + Pt) molar ratio of the mono- and bimetallic catalysts. The Ref/Ox ratio was highest on 2RhPt and lowest on Pt. Both, the activity for OX and the presence of thermal cracking, decreased the reforming selectivity of Pt.

3.2.3. Short-term stability of RhPt catalysts
The stability of RhPt catalysts, calcined at 700 or 900 C, was studied at 700 C for 5 or 6 h, respectively. The H2 production is presented in Fig. 7 for catalysts calcined at 700 C. The H2 production decreased with time on Rh(700) and 0.5RhPt(700) indicating a change in the catalyst structure or even catalyst deactivation, as was expected for Rh [10] ,[15] . Also the decrease in conversions and the increase in thermal cracking products, mainly ethene, reflected the deactivation of Rh(700). On 0.5RhPt(700), on the other hand, neither a decrease in the hydrocarbon conversions was observed nor thermal cracking products were formed, revealing improved stability compared to that of Rh(700). The stability of the bimetallic RhPt catalysts improved further with the increase in Rh/Pt ratio ( Fig. 7 ). Also the higher calcination temperature (900 C) stabilized the surface structure of the mono- and bimetallic RhPt catalysts, as the product distribution and the conversions remained constant during the whole experiment (data not reported).

Formation of H2 (mmol/min/gcat) as a function of time in ATR of simulated gasoline (700 C/5 h) on Pt(700) (), 0.5RhPt(700) (), 1RhPt(700) (), 2RhPt(700) (), and Rh(700) () catalysts (0.2 g). H2O/C = 3 mol/mol, O2/C = 0.34 mol/mol.Under the conditions of the stability test (700 C), the reforming activity and selectivity of monometallic Pt catalysts were low. Nonetheless, the Pt(700) catalyst remained stable ( Fig. 7 ). In fact, the hydrocarbon and water conversions improved with time. Similar results on Rh deactivation and Pt stability were reported for SR of biomass-derived pyrolysis oil [33] . According to Bitter et al.
[32] , the activity of a Pt catalyst is linearly proportional to the concentration of the Pt-ZrO2 interface, whereas the activity of Rh catalysts is directly proportional to the availability of Rh. Hence, Rh catalysts are more sensitive for deactivation.
3.2.4. Carbon deposition
After the stability tests (700 C/56 h), carbon deposition ( Fig. 6 ) of the used catalysts was measured. On all catalysts, the carbon deposition was extremely low, as less than 0.01 mol% of the fed carbon (2.9 mmol C/min) was accumulated on the catalysts. On bimetallic catalysts, moreover, the carbon deposition was lower than on monometallic catalysts, which is especially evident for the calcination temperature of 700 C. The average carbon deposition ( Fig. 6 ) was highest on the monometallic Pt catalyst (0.550.88 mg/gcat/h), as was proposed owing to the high amounts of thermal cracking products formed. Indeed, alkenes, in particular ethene, are considered carbon precursors [34] . Moreover, the average carbon deposition per hour corresponded to that reported by Souza and Schmal [14] for Pt/ZrO2 catalyst tested in dry reforming of methane (0.80.9 mg coke/gcat/h). Despite of the carbon deposition ( Fig. 6 ) and the presence of thermal cracking, no deactivation nor changes in the product distribution of the Pt(700) or Pt(900) catalysts were observed with time.
On the monometallic Rh catalysts, the carbon deposition (0.370.54 mg/gcat/h) was lower than on Pt, in agreement with the results of Cavallaro et al.
[35] . They suggested that only small amounts of whisker carbon are formed in ATR on Rh/Al2O3 catalysts, and this type of carbon easily reacts with oxygen regenerating the surface [35] . The same conclusions on the effect of oxygen were drawn in SR studies of biomass-derived pyrolysis oil, where a higher amount of carbon was deposited on Rh/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 than on Pt/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, but this carbon was mostly burnt off during regeneration [33] . Although carbon is easily burnt off with O2 (present in ATR) the Rh(700) catalyst deactivated with time ( Fig. 7 ).When the deposited carbon is removed by CO2 (Eq. (3) ) or H2O (Eq. (4) ), additional H2 and CO are formed. Hence, the high amount of CO along with the lower amount of CO2 on Pt and ZrO2 ( Table 3 ) reveal the presence of reverse-Boudouard reaction (Eq. (3) ) at 700 C, as favored by thermodynamics. This observation is, furthermore, in good agreement with CO2 pulsing experiments performed by Bitter et al.
[32] on coked Pt/ZrO2. They suggested that the ability of the ZrO2 support to release oxygen might be important in CO formation [32] .With elevated calcination temperature (900 C), carbon deposition increased on catalysts with higher Pt loading, and decreased on catalysts with higher Rh-loading. With both calcination temperatures, lowest amounts of deposited carbon were measured on 2RhPt catalysts. The results on carbon deposition agreed with those on catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability, as carbon deposition was lowest on catalysts, where the H2 formation was stable ( Fig. 7 ) and the Ref/Ox ratio was highest ( Fig. 6 ).
3.2.5. Characterization of used catalysts
Metal loadings of the used catalysts were determined ( Table 1 ). Slight differences were detected in the metal loadings of the fresh and used catalysts. These differences are explained by the analytical error of ICP-AES [30] and the difficulties in dissolution of Rh into the acid, not excluding the possibility of moisture present in the fresh sample. In contrast to our earlier results [15] , no depletion of Rh was perceived after the stability tests (700 C).In SEM measurements, no sintering of Rh was observed, as only the support structure was visible on the used Rh(700) and Rh(900) catalysts. On Pt-containing catalysts, that is Pt(700), Pt(900), 2RhPt(700), and 2RhPt(900), however, significant sintering was noticed. Furthermore, on the monometallic Pt catalysts ( Fig. 8 a), large metal clusters of undefined shape were detected, whereas on the used 2RhPt catalysts ( Fig. 8 b), the large metal clusters had clearly an orthorhombic structure.

4. Discussion
4.1. Catalytic performance of bimetallic RhPt catalysts
The catalytic performance of an average alloy is better than that of the less active metal (Pt) but lower than that of the most active metal (Rh) [25] . However, if there is synergism between the two metals, the performance of the alloy is even better than that of the more active metal [24] ,[25] ,[26] . Summarizing the results on catalyst performance, synergism between Rh and Pt is evident on the ZrO2-supported bimetallic catalysts. On catalysts where Rh predominated, improved catalyst selectivity (Ref/Ox, Fig. 6 ) and stability ( Fig. 7 ) were obtained. Hence, a slight addition of Pt improved the Rh catalyst selectivity and stability markedly and increased the H2 chemisorption uptake ( Table 2 ). Respectively, only a slight addition of Rh was sufficient to improve the catalyst activity of the bimetallic catalyst over that of the monometallic Pt ( Fig. 4 ).On Pt-containing catalysts, however, strong sintering was observed during aging in ATR ( Fig. 8 ), which is fully inconsistent with the high activity and stability observed, i.e. for the bimetallic 2RhPt catalysts. Indeed, Pt is more sensitive to sintering than Rh owing to its lower melting point and the migration sensitivity [22] ,[36] . Besides, due to the low surface area of ZrO2 ( Table 2 ), the surface concentrations of the noble metals (0.5 wt%) are relatively high, which promotes sintering. For monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, the calculated surface concentrations are 2.4 μmol Rh/m2 and 1.2 μmol Pt/m2, respectively. Furthermore, as sintering accelerates with temperature, the metal particle size on 2RhPt(900) is larger than on 2RhPt(700), thus requiring higher temperatures for reduction ( Fig. 1 ).
4.2. Presence of a RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium
Recently, Kolb et al.
[37] claimed that the binary alloys of Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt were misunderstood for nearly half a century and there exists no immiscibility in the RhxPt1x system below 760 C [38] , which was also disproved by Jacob et al.
[39] in thermodynamic measurements. Besides, Jacob et al. introduced the presence of an alloy-oxide equilibrium in the Rh-Pt-O ternary system measured on an Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 solid electrolyte [17] ,[39] . Considering the miscibility of the RhxPt1x system, the presence of an alloy on the bimetallic catalysts is possible with all Rh/Pt ratios. Moreover, in an oxidizing environment the formation of equilibrium between the RhxPt1x alloy and Rh2O3 is possible [17] .
It is presented that RhxPt1x alloys result in a strong Pt enrichment of the surface as the temperature increases (maximum at 830 C) [23] ,[40] , which agrees with our results on the composition (EDX) of the metal particles of 2RhPt(900). Furthermore, an ordered Rh oxide overlayer is formed on such Pt-enriched bimetallic surfaces (e.g. Rh/Pt(100) and Pt/Rh(100)) [41] . Indeed, RhxPt1x alloys have been classified as near-surface alloys (NSAs) owing to the tendency of subsurface metal layer formation [42] .In SEM measurements, orthorhombic metal clusters were detected on the fresh ( Fig. 2 b) and used ( Fig. 8 b) bimetallic catalysts. These orthorhombic crystals differ from the lattice structure proposed for pure Rh or Pt crystals (face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals (Pearson's symbol cF4)) [43] , or the cubo-octahedral shape predicted for the RhxPt1x alloy clusters [44] . After high temperature (>500 C) oxidation treatments, however, a stable, orthorhombic structure for Rh2O3 is confirmed [45] . Moreover, reducible Rh species similar to Rh2O3 are reported to be the active form of Rh [46] , which would explain the high catalytic performance of these bimetallic catalysts. Both metals (Rh and Pt) were found in all metal particles of the 2RhPt(900) catalyst (EDX), which supports our suggestion of a RhxPt1x alloy that is incased in the core of the Rh2O3 layer. On monometallic Pt catalyst neither reducible species (TPR, Fig. 1 ) nor orthorhombic crystals (SEM, Fig. 2 ) were detected, consistent with the low reforming activity.According to the TPR-, SEM-, and EDX-results and when considering the improved catalyst performance, we suggest the presence of the Rh-Pt-O ternary system on the bimetallic RhPt/ZrO2 catalysts, where the metal clusters consist of a RhxPt1x alloy subsurface and a Rh2O3 overlayer. A scheme for the synergism between Rh and Pt on the ZrO2-support and the formation of RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium under oxidizing conditions is presented in Fig. 9 . On the monometallic Rh catalyst ( Fig. 9 a), interaction with the support is strong and continues during the aging in ATR. Moreover, the migration of various supports such as CeO2 [19] ,[31] , TiO2 [20] , Al2O3 [31] , and YSZ [31] on top of the Rh crystallites is possible. Therefore, the migration of the support or the migration of Rh into the support cannot be excluded in the case of ZrO2 [47] . Owing to the possible Rh encapsulation, the Rh-loading of the catalyst is most likely concentrated into lower layers of the catalyst, thereby explaining why metal particles were not detected in the SEM measurements of the monometallic Rh catalysts. Subsurface metal layers might, still, affect the binding of adsorbed species, yielding varied reaction rates and selectivities for the catalytic process [48] . Besides, as part of the Rh is encapsulated in the support, a second reduction step at higher temperature (TPR, Fig. 1 ) is needed for the reduction of the Rh oxides that are in strong interaction with the support [31] .Download: Download full-size image Fig. 9. A scheme for the interactions of Pt and Rh on ZrO2-supported (a) Rh, (b) Pt, and (c) RhPt catalysts under oxidizing conditions of calcination and aging in ATR.Also for Pt/ZrO2 ( Fig. 9 b), strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is observed [32] ,[47] , and either the formation of a Pt-Zr alloy or the Pt encapsulation in ZrO2 is suggested [47] . As Pt is in metallic state (Pt0), the strong interaction with the support is, however, not noticed in the H2-TPR ( Fig. 1 ).On the bimetallic catalysts ( Fig. 9 c), the formation of the RhxPt1x alloy impairs the SMSI [11] . Hence, the encapsulation of the noble metals (Rh and Pt) is prevented, and the Rh2O3, formed under oxidizing conditions, is reduced in one step only ( Fig. 1 ). Owing to the RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium part of the Rh is present in the reduced state (Rh0), thus decreasing the consumption of H2 during TPR ( Fig. 1 ).The Rh2O3 is the active site of the mono- (Rh) and bimetallic (RhPt) catalysts, but the strong interaction of Rh with the ZrO2-support and the possible encapsulation of Rh deactivate the three-way catalyst (Rh/Ce-ZrO2) with time [46] . According to the presented results, a slight addition of Pt is, however, sufficient to improve the catalyst performance of Rh in ATR of simulated gasoline. Due to the synergism of Rh and Pt, a RhxPt1x alloy is formed, which impairs the interaction of the metals with the support [11] , as is demonstrated in Fig. 9 . Moreover, the amount of active Rh2O3 can be controlled with the Rh/Pt ratio [17] ,[49] , temperature, and partial pressure of O2 that together affect the RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium in the Rh-Pt-O ternary system [17] .
5. Conclusions
ATR of simulated gasoline was studied on ZrO2-supported mono- and bimetallic RhPt catalysts. Only a small addition of Rh improved the activity of the Pt catalyst markedly. In selectivity and stability the bimetallic RhPt catalysts were superior to the monometallic Rh or Pt catalysts. The reforming activity of the bimetallic catalysts was intermediate between those of the monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts, in proportion to the Rh-loading.
At high calcination temperature, the BET-surface area and the irreversible H2 chemisorption uptakes decreased and sintering of the catalysts was detected. Still, the higher calcination temperature had a stabilizing effect on all the catalysts and improved the selectivity for reforming. With high calcination temperature (900 C), the carbon deposition increased when Pt predominated and decreased when Rh was predominant, likely due to the Boudouard reaction. Thus, changing the Rh/Pt ratio can optimize the RhPt catalyst performance, not forgetting the effect of calcination temperature.
Based on the TPR-, SEM-, and EDX-results and the behavior of the bimetallic catalysts in ATR, strong synergism between Rh and Pt is observed. The synergism between Rh and Pt improved the performance of the catalyst, and higher selectivity and stability towards carbon deposition were obtained on bimetallic catalysts than on monometallic Rh and Pt catalysts. This was also evidenced by the Ref/Ox ratio, the production of H2, and the carbon deposition. Moreover, we suggest the presence of a RhxPt1xRh2O3 equilibrium, where the Rh2O3 is the active site of the catalyst.
