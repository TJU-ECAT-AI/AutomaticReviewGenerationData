Diffusion Liquids a b s t r a c t Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous car- bon materials. Pore space characterization in NMR cryoporometry is based on the measurement of melt- ing point depression of the confined liquids, whereas NMR relaxometry and diffusometry explore the random motion of the molecules under confinement by the pore space. We demonstrate compatibility between the evidence of classical sorption experiments and NMR cryoporometry on pore size distribu- tion. There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients. These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space. Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 lm.

1. Introduction
Nanoporous carbon materials are used in a wide range of indus- trial applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, separation,storage of gases and fluid purification. These materials are charac- terized by a complex porous network constituted of micropores with pore width of less than 2 nm, mesopores with pore widths be- tween 2 and 50 nm and macropores with pore width of greater than 50 nm. Such a three-dimensional pore structure results in a material that exhibits a high surface area together with a high pore volume. Additionally, carbon materials can accommodate hetero- atoms (mainly oxygen surface groups) on structural defects (e.g. boundaries of the graphene layer) which affect the surface chemis- try of the material. A main advantage of porous carbons in respect to other porous solids is that, both the porous structure and the surface chemistry can be tailored by pre- and post-synthesis treat- ments. This helps to achieve the properties required for a particular application [1].
The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materi- als strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used. Microporous carbons can be prepared from a wide variety of lignocellulosic pre- cursors (olive stones, coconut shell, etc.) using either physical (CO2, H2O, etc.) or chemical (H3PO4, ZnCl2, etc.) activation [24].
Although the presence of microporosity is required to achieve a high surface area, i.e. a high adsorption capacity, the presence of some mesoporosity is quite often desirable. Mesopores are very useful, not only for processes involving larger molecules, but also because they constitute channels for speeding up the access to the inner microporosity. Carbon materials with a highly developed mesoporosity can be prepared using different approaches, such as combination of chemical and physical activation, use of nanocast- ing (hard and soft template strategy) technology, etc. [57].
Textural characterization of nanoporous carbon materials is commonly performed using adsorption of probe molecules (He, Ar, N2, CO2, etc.). Among them, N2 adsorption at 77 K and CO2 adsorption at 273 K are the most widely used to assess both the to- tal microporosity (<2 nm) and the narrow microporosity (<0.7 nm),respectively [8]. Additionally, application of several mathematical models to the adsorption isotherms can provide information about the apparent surface area, pore size distribution, etc. (e.g. Bru- nauerEmmettTeller equation to the N2 adsorption isotherm).Although the correct characterization of the textural properties is of paramount importance to understand the behaviour of carbon materials in a certain application, their effectiveness in adsorption processes will also be highly depending on the transport (diffusion) of adsorptives to the inner pore system.NMR methods have proven to be an efficient tool to study mi- cro- and mesoporous materials and surface interactions of con- fined liquids [9]. A combination of several NMR techniques is especially useful as it allows for elucidation of a multitude of important system characteristics.

NMR cryoporometry provides informa- tion on the distribution of the pore size. NMR relaxometry is espe- cially sensitive to surface interactions. The aim of this work is the characterization of mesoporous carbons by combination of the three NMR techniques: cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusom- etry. Various adsorptive molecules were used for this study. One of the accents was put on monitoring molecular transport of the con- fined liquids in the porous space of the investigated materials. Di- rect measurements of molecular self-diffusion were performed with the help of Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG) NMR permitting one to obtain an in-depth information on both transport properties of the confined liquids and the structure characteristics of the host material.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Two carbon molecular sieves (Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A, Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd.) and three different activated carbons (PK13, RGC30 and MAC-LMA12) have been used in this study.
The selection of these samples is based on their different textural properties. While carbon molecular sieves and the activated carbon PK13 (Norit) are mainly microporous, the samples RGC30 (Nuchar) and MAC-LMA12 exhibit both micro- and mesoporosity.
Carbon molecular sieves Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A and acti- vated carbons PK13 and RGC30 are commercially available carbon materials. Sample MAC-LMA12 (MAC: mesoporous activated car- bon; LMA: Laboratorio de Materiales Avanzados; x = 12: produc- tion number) was prepared from olive stones as a raw material.
Firstly, the olive stones were crashed, sieved to 3 mm and washed with diluted H2SO4 (10%) to remove the majority of inorganic impurities. The clean sample was impregnated with an aqueous solution of CaCl2 (7 wt.%) for 7 h in a thermostatic water bath at 358 K. After 7 h, the temperature was increased up to 373 K and held at this temperature until the level of water became similar to that of olive stone, the remaining water being removed by filtra- tion. The impregnated sample was dried for 24 h at 353 K in an air recirculation oven and then it was submitted to an activation treat- ment in a horizontal furnace using CO2 (100 ml min1) at 1043 K for 6 h. After the activation, the sample was outgassed in a vacuum oven for 4 h at 323 K, in order to remove the remaining CO2 ad- sorbed, and subsequently washed with hot HCl (5%) in order to re- move the remaining calcium; a final washing with distilled water until pH 7 was performed.
In order to avoid interferences in the diffusion process from inorganic species remaining on the carbon structure, all carbon materials have been washed with HCl (10%) at 353 K for 3 h. After the acid treatment, carbon samples have been washed with dis- tilled water until pH 7 and subsequently dried overnight at 353 K. After the washing treatment, the total ash content is mainly nil for RGC30, MAC-LMA12, Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A samples,while it is around 2 wt.% for sample PK13.
2.2. Sample characterization
N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms were determined in a Coulter Omnisorb-610 equipment at 77 K and 273 K, respectively. Prior to the adsorption measurement, samples were outgassed under vac- uum (103 Pa) at 523 K for 4 h. Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equa- tion was applied to the N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms in order to obtain both the total micropore volume (V0) and the volume of narrow microporosity (Vn), respectively [12]. Total pore volume (Vt) was obtained from the amount adsorbed at P/P0  0.99 on the N2 isotherm, while the mesopore volume (Vmeso) was calculated from the difference between Vt and V0. The apparent surface area (SBET) was determined applying the BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) equation to the N2 adsorption isotherms.
2.3. NMR analysis
All NMR measurements were performed with the help of the home-built PFG NMR spectrometer FEGRIS NT, operating at a 1H resonance frequency of 125 MHz [13]. High-intensity magnetic field gradients (up to 35 Tm1) were applied.
The construction of the melting curves in the experiments on NMR cryoporometry was based on the temperature dependences of the NMR signal intensity. The latter was evaluated as the maxi- mal spin-echo amplitude produced by the standard Hahn echo radio frequency pulse sequence (90s180). The value of s was set to 2 ms. All measured echo amplitudes were normalized by the value of the (echo) amplitude at the highest temperature (above the bulk melting point). The range of investigated temper- atures was between 165 K and 298 K. The experiments were started at the lowest temperature and then the temperature was increased in steps of 5 K. The relaxation rates of the adsorbate mol- ecules in the investigated samples were determined using the CarrPurcellMejboomGill (CPMG) pulse sequence. The measure- ment of diffusion coefficients in PFG NMR was performed with the help of the standard three 90- pulse sequence (also known as the stimulated echo pulse sequence).
The preparation of the samples for the NMR experiments was performed as follows. The host material was introduced into the sample tubes with an outer diameter of 7.5 mm. After that, the tubes with the material were heated at 383 K during 24 h in an oven under atmospheric conditions. Then the samples were con- nected to the vacuum system and dehydrated under high vacuum (<102 Pa) at 523 K for around 4 h. While evacuating, a certain amount of liquid was injected into the tubes. For relaxation and diffusion experiments, the amount of the sorbate was adjusted to achieve full loading of the pores (100% of the total pore volume).For the NMR cryoporometry experiments, the amount of sorbate (nitrobenzene in our work) was supplied in excess, thus allowing an oversaturation of the host material. Finally, the sample tubes were sealed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural characterization
Fig. 1 shows the N2 adsorption isotherms for the different sam- ples studied. As it can be observed, all carbon materials exhibit a high nitrogen uptake at low relative pressures (P/P0 < 0.01), which mainly corresponds to the adsorption on micropores. After the sharp knee in the N2 isotherms, samples PK13 and MAC-LMA12 ex- hibit a near-plateau with a small slope but, above P/P0  0.6, the sample MAC-LMA12 exhibits an important increase in the amount adsorbed and a hysteresis loop suggesting the additional presence of some mesoporosity. The situation becomes different for sample Nuchar RGC30. This activated carbon exhibits a continuous in- crease in the amount adsorbed over the whole relative pressure range (up to P/P0 = 0.97), which corresponds to the combined pres- ence of microporosity together with a well-developed mesoporos- ity. These findings are clearly reflected on Table 1. The micropore volume obtained from the N2 (V0) and CO2 (Vn) adsorption iso- therms for sample Norit PK13 is quite similar, thus reflecting the presence of a narrow micropore size distribution on this sample [14]. This difference between V0 and Vn becomes slightly more evi- 92

dent for the synthesized activated carbon, denoted MAC-LMA12, in which the total pore volume is constituted by about 70% mesop- ores and 30% micropores. Last but not least, sample RGC30 exhibits very different values for V0 and Vn, which confirms the presence of a broad micropore size distribution with combination of both micropores and mesopores (the proportion of narrow micropores being less important than for the other carbons).
As it has been mentioned before, carbon molecular sieves Tak- eda 4A and Takeda 5A have been also considered for this study due to the pure microporous nature of these samples (more than 90% of the pore volume is in the range of microporosity), with the mesopore volume in these materials being almost nil [15].
The micropore volume (V0) obtained from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K is 0.22 cm3 g1 and 0.33 cm3 g1, for samples Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A, respectively. The two carbon molecular sieves Tak- eda 4A and Takeda 5A differentiate from each other by the size of the mouth in the microporous space: 0.4 and 0.5 nm, respectively [1].
3.2. NMR cryoporometry
NMR cryoporometry exploits the melting point depression of liquids confined in mesopores [16]. The melting temperature Tm of a liquid frozen in pores is lower than that of a bulk liquid as a consequence of the smaller crystal sizes and the enhanced sur- face-to-volume ratio. This effect is larger for smaller pores. Accord- ing to the GibbsThomson equation [17] the difference between the normal (bulk) and the depressed melting points (in pores) is in- versely proportional to the pore diameter d DTmd  Tm  Tmd  k=d;1 where k is a constant related to the thermodynamic properties of the confined liquid. In materials with a distribution of pore diame- ters, the melting temperature of the confined liquid will vary with the pore size. In NMR cryoporometry, one only observes the NMR signal due to the molecules in the liquid state. Therefore, at each temperature below the bulk melting point, the measured signal intensity is proportional to the volume of the non-frozen liquid con- fined in the pores. Analyzing the NMR response as a function of the temperature permits to determine the distribution of the pore sizes using the Dt Dd kDt DTmdd 2 2 where t is the total volume of pores with diameters 6 d. Hence, Dt Dd is nothing else than the pore size distribution, which, owing to Eq. (2),becomes directly experimentally accessible. The parameter k should be known (or calibrated) in advance. This method is limited to pore sizes exceeding 1 nm and is efficient in characterizing the pores on the mesoscopic length scale.
The transverse nuclear magnetic relaxation of guest molecules within the micropores was typically small (62 ms) so that the con- tribution of these molecules to the observed NMR signal could be neglected. It is, therefore, exclusively the size distribution of the mesopores which is traced in our present cryoporometry studies.
In this work, the so-called melting curves, i.e. the temperature dependences of the NMR signal intensity, were measured for nitro- benzene confined in MAC-LMA12, Nuchar RGC30 and Norit PK13.
Fig. 2 shows the melting curves of all three samples in the range of temperatures between 165 K and 298 K. The bulk melting point of nitrobenzene at 279 K is indicated as the vertical line. A step-like decrease in the vicinity of this temperature observed for all three samples is attributed to the bulk liquid component (outside the pores). Obviously, in sample MAC-LMA12 this decay merges with the decay in large mesopores and macropores which introduces a large uncertainty in pore size distribution resulting from this part of the melting curve. For two samples, MAC-LMA12 and RGC30, a change of the signal intensity was also observed at lower temper- atures, i.e. below the bulk step. This change refers to melting of nitrobenzene confined in the mesoporous space of these materials.

93 In Norit PK13, melting in the mesopores was not observed. This indicates that the mesoporous volume in PK13 is small in compar- ison to the other two samples; in agreement with the adsorption results (see Table 1).
The pore size distributions of RGC30 and MAC-LMA12 calcu- lated from the melting curves are shown in Fig. 3. The mean pore diameters could roughly be estimated from the peaks of the distri- bution functions as 2 nm and 7 nm for MAC-LMA12 and RGC30 samples, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that the distribution around these values is broader for RGC30 than for MAC-LMA12. In the lat- ter sample, there is an additional broad peak centered at around 15 nm. It corresponds to the first steep decay in the melting curves,close to the bulk melting point. Due to the limited resolution in this range of our melting curve, this peak does only indicate the pres- ence of some larger mesopores and macropores and is not suitable for quantitative analysis.
3.3. NMR relaxometry
In addition to NMR cryoporometry which is sensitive to pore space geometry, NMR relaxometry can provide valuable informa- tion on molecular dynamics of the confined liquid and on surface interactions. The adsorbate molecules probe the pore structure and surfaces via translational diffusion between the surface sites and the internal volume of the pore. In the vicinity of the solid sur- face, the transverse relaxation time T2 of a liquid tends to decrease in comparison to the bulk state. The decrease is the larger the stronger is the surface interaction and is usually more pronounced for polar liquids. In pores with characteristic sizes of a few or a few tens of nanometers the exchange between the surface sites and the pore interior is fast on the time scale of the NMR experiment. The measured transverse relaxation rate T1 2 of a liquid in the mesop- ores, therefore, will represent an average of the bulk-like liquid relaxation rate T1 2;bulk and the enhanced surface relaxation rate,weighted according to the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore.

(3) contains quantities related both to geometrical characteristics (surface-to-volume ratio) and to surface interactions (surface relaxivity).

Therefore, the measured relaxation rate in Eq. (3) is deter- mined solely by the second term. Provided the distribution of relax- ivities fT1 2  is due to distribution of the pore sizes only, the latter can be deduced from the measured relaxation function, Eq. (5). This was demonstrated, for example, for a series of silica gels in Ref. [11].

This component is relevant for a quite small fraction of molecules (1020%) and, therefore, cannot be analysed in more detail as it is masked by the dominating slower component. The latter refers to 8090% of molecules and exhibits a moderate deviation from the exponential behaviour.
The existence of two components in the relaxation curves indicates the presence of two species of molecules with different dynamic properties. The species with the faster relaxation and smaller pop- ulation should probably be attributed to the liquid confined in the microporous space. The larger fraction with slower relaxation should then be attributed to the liquid in the mesopores. It is worth noting that the exchange between the two species is hindered. This Fig. 3.

is in spite of the large diffusion path lengths of more than 100 nm,notably exceeding the pore sizes. In turn, this should mean that as soon as the molecules enter the microporous space (or some spe- cific areas of this space) they tend to stay in this space and not eas- ily exchange with the molecules in the mesopores.
The mean relaxation rates were determined from the initial slopes of the slow components of the relaxation curves according to Eq. (4). The corresponding inverse values, 1=hT1 2 i, for toluene,ethanol and nitrobenzene were 10 ms, 7 ms and 6 ms, respectively.
The fact that the relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene were shorter than in toluene correlates with the much stronger polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene. This is due to the stronger surface interactions of polar molecules giving rise to enhanced relaxivity at the surface and, hence, to shorter overall transverse relaxation times [11].
PFG NMR diffusion studies reveal molecular displacements of order of micrometers during the experimental observation times (see Section 3.4). Therefore, a non-exponential relaxation behav- iour can only be observed if the sample consists of sub-regions of different pore characteristics (e.g. mean pore sizes) with exten- sions over at least tens of micrometers.
The analysis of the molecular dynamics in the microporous space of the MAC-LMA12 material was approached by separate studies of the microporous carbon materials Takeda 4A and Takeda
5A. The relaxation curves of ethanol and toluene in these materials
are shown in Fig. 5. Only slight deviations from the exponential behaviour are observed. The relaxation times (obtained as the in- verse values of the mean relaxation rates, 1=hT1 2 i) were 1.2 ms and 2 ms for ethanol, and 0.5 ms and 0.8 ms for toluene in Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A, respectively. Again the trends in the relaxation rates exhibit the expected behaviour. The relaxation times become the smaller, the more rigid are the formed guest-host complexes:both an increase in the guest size (from ethanol to toluene) and a decrease in the host cage size (from Takeda 5A to Takeda 4A;in parallel with an enhancement of the surface-to-volume ratio) lead to slower relaxation times.
3.4. NMR diffusometry
The PFG NMR technique provides information about the pore structure via the transport properties of the adsorbed molecules.
The attenuation of the NMR signal is related to the propagator P(x,t) (the probability distribution of molecular displacements along the axis of gradient direction x during the time t) according to Wq; t
Z
Px; t cosqxdx;8 where q = cdg, and c is the nuclear gyromagnetic ration, with g and d denoting the amplitude and the duration of the magnetic field gra- dients, respectively. In isotropic homogeneous systems, the propa- gator is typically represented by a Gaussian function Px; t  4pDt1=2 exp x2 4Dt
;9 where D is the diffusion coefficient. The latter correlates the mean square displacement and time according to the Einstein equation [21] for normal diffusion hx2ti  2Dt:10 By inserting Eq. (9) into Eq. (8), the PFG NMR signal attenuation for normal diffusion is found to be: Wq; t  expq2tD:11 For a distribution of diffusivities, a multi-exponential attenuation curve will result: Wq; t
Z
fD expq2tDdD;12 where f(D) denotes the distribution function of diffusivities, i.e. the probability that the diffusion path of an arbitrary selected mole- cules during the observation time may be characterized by a diffu- sivity D. Depending on the size of the regions within the samples, to which these different diffusivities may be attributed, this distribu- tion may be a function of the observation time, tending to become smaller with increasing observation time. The mean diffusivity hDi can be evaluated from the initial slopes of the attenuation curves:hDi   lim q2t!0 @ln Wq; t @q2t

fDDdD:13 In this work, we investigated the diffusion of several liquids con- fined in MAC-LMA12. The sorbate molecules were ethanol, toluene,nitrobenzene, acetone and n-decane. As an example, Fig. 6 shows the diffusion attenuation curve for ethanol at 298 K. The observed behaviour is typical of all liquids considered. It exhibits a clear devi- ation from the exponential function and can tentatively be analysed in terms of two components: Wq; t

Dslow is the minimal value of the diffusion coefficient allowed by the NMR equipment. Dsorbate = hDi is the mean diffusion coefficient evaluated from the initial slope of the attenuation which was obtained after subtraction of the slow component from the total attenuation curve (circles in the inset).

95 where fslow and Dslow denote the relative fraction and the diffusivity of molecules contributing to the slowly attenuating component of the curve, f(D) is the distribution of diffusivities related to the dom- inating (faster) component. (The relative fractions of the fast and slow component are normalized as R fDdD  fslow  1). The values of fslow and Dslow, as evaluated from the fits of the exponential func- tion to the slow component of the curve in Fig. 6, were 0.062 and 4  1013 m2 s1.
The two constituents of the diffusion attenuation indicate that,over the observation time, the molecules exist in essentially two different dynamical states, as observed already above in context of nuclear magnetic relaxation. Again, we attribute the smaller fraction with the smaller diffusivities to molecules confined in the micropores and the dominating fraction with the larger diffu- sivities to the liquid in the mesopore space.
The faster attenuating component, obtained after subtraction of the slow component from the total attenuation is shown in the in- set, Fig. 6. It exhibits a clear deviation from the exponential depen- dence, thus indicating a distribution of diffusivities as incorporated by the first term in Eq. (14). The mean diffusion coefficient hDi referring to the fast component was determined from the initial slope. It equals approximately 1.7  109 m2 s1 and thus is four orders of magnitude larger than Dslow.
The slow diffusion component is to be compared with the diffu- sion behaviour of the same liquid in the microporous Takeda sam- ples. Fig. 7 shows the diffusion attenuation curves of ethanol in Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A at 298 K. In Takeda 5A, the attenuation curves were exponential over the covered range of more than one order of magnitude. In Takeda 4A, the signal intensity was so small (as a consequence of the fast transverse relaxation) so that the data points could be measured only in a limited range, not be- low 50% of the initial amplitude. In this range, the observed atten- uations were exponential as well. The diffusion coefficient of ethanol in Takeda 5A, evaluated from the exponential fits to the data points, was 8  1012 m2 s1. In Takeda 4A, the evaluated dif- fusivity was 9  1013 m2 s1, nearly one order of the magnitude smaller than in Takeda 5A. This finding complies with the shorter relaxation time observed in Takeda 4A and quantifies the effect of the more severe restriction to diffusion due to the smaller pores in this material, as compared with Takeda 5A.
Fig. 8 shows the diffusion attenuation curves of toluene in MAC- LMA12 for various observation times in the range between 10 ms and 300 ms. No time dependence of the attenuations was observed for both the slow and fast (see inset) components. The molecular displacements monitored in our experiments were between 60 nm for the slower component and 23 lm for the faster compo- nent. On the one hand, the absence of the time dependence indi- cates that there is practically no exchange between the two different species as it was suggested on the basis of the relaxation studies. On the other hand, it provides evidence that the mesop- ores in MAC-LMA12 represent a well interconnected space, rather than a system of closed separated pores. In the latter case one would have to expect a decrease of the curve slopes with increas- ing observation times.The diffusion behaviour of several liquids (acetone, ethanol, tol- uene, n-decane and nitrobenzene) confined in MAC-LMA12 was compared. Table 2 provides the comparison of the resulting mean diffusivities Dsorbate with the bulk diffusivities of these liquids Dliquid. Depending on the particular guest, the diffusivities within the pore system are found to be both larger and smaller than the bulk diffusivities. This finding may be related to the fact that due to the presence of the host lattice, guest diffusion may occur both in a liquid (phase 1) attached to the pore system and through the free space (phase 2). With the respective relative amounts of mol- ecules pi and diffusivities Di, the mean diffusivity as accessible by PFG NMR will result to be [22] Dsorbate  p1D1  p2D2 15 The diffusivity D1 in the free space, following gas-phase or Knudsen diffusion [9,22], is notably larger and the diffusivity D2 in the liquid phase, due to the tortuosity of the pore space, is smaller than the diffusivity Dliquid in the bulk phase. Thus, depending on the relative contributions p1 and p2, Dsorbate may in fact assume larger or smaller values than Dliquid. The magnitude of p1 increases in proportion with the vapor phase pressure and, hence, also the contribution of the first term in Eq. (15). Hence, it is in complete agreement with our Fig. 7.

The diffusion coefficient of the liquid in pores Dsorbate = hDi is the mean value of the diffusivity in the pores and was calculated from the initial slope of the attenuation curve.

understanding that, as shown in Table 2, a decrease in the boiling point (which corresponds to a decrease in the vapor pressure at a given temperature) is accompanied with a decrease in Dsorbate.
The latter, according to Eq. (15), reflects a decrease in p1, i.e. in the contribution of the fast (gas-phase) mode of molecular propagation.
4. Conclusions
Carbon materials containing different proportions of micro- and mesoporosity were studied. The combination of different NMR methods was used to explore the pore structure and the interac- tion of the adsorbate with the pore walls. Pore size distribution in samples RGC30 and MAC-LMA12 was determined by NMR cry- oporometry. In MAC-LMA12, a narrow pore size distribution was observed, with a mean pore size of about 2 nm; RGC30 sample has a broad pore size distribution, centered around a mean pore size of about 7 nm. These two values reflect the differences ob- served in the N2 (77 K) and CO2 (273 K) adsorption isotherms.
In microporous Takeda 4A, the sorbate relaxation rates were larger and the diffusivities smaller than in Takeda 5A. This evi- dences that sorbate molecule in Takeda 4A experience stronger restrictions in both their re-orientational and translational motions than in Takeda 5A, as a consequence of the smaller pore size of Takeda 4A. In MAC-LMA12, two molecular species with different relaxation and diffusion properties were observed. The dominating part of molecules confined in MAC-LMA12 exhibited much smaller relaxation rates and larger diffusivities than in Takeda samples.
This is attributed to the presence of mesopores which tend to con- fine the dominating part of the liquid. Besides, diffusion experi- ments showed the existence of the quite broad distribution of the diffusivities. This is attributed to heterogeneities of the mate- rial on length scales notably exceeding the characteristic molecular displacements (in the range of micrometers).
