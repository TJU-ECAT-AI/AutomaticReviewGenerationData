[1] "The catalytic reforming of naphtha is usually performed using a bifunctional catalyst containing both a hydrogenating metal and an acid function."
[2] "The most common explanation of the properties of the catalyst is based on PtRe alloy formation (5) and the interaction of such an alloy with sulphur (69)."
[3] "Studies using EDX and TEM (20, 21) conclude that no rhenium can be detected in the platinum particles in the bimetallic system after reduction at 400C, although the yields from reforming experiments indicate that a significant fraction of the rhenium must be present in the metallic state."
[4] "The highest degree of PtRe interaction was found when the catalyst was not dehydrated prior to reduction, while drying in N2 at high temperatures before reduction causes sintering of platinum particles and low bimetallic interaction."

The scientific literature focuses on the influence of pretreatment temperature on the bimetallic interaction in Pt-Re/Al2O3 reforming catalysts, specifically through the use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The study examines the relationship between the formation of bimetallic particles of platinum and rhenium and the pretreatment conditions of the catalyst. It reveals that if the catalyst is dried in air at temperatures above 500°C before reduction at 480°C, bimetallic particles form. Higher temperatures and air absence inhibit the transport of mobile rhenium species on the surface, preventing intimate contact between the two metals. The platinum LIII EXAFS data indicate that the average particle size of the bimetallic particles on the alumina surface is less than 10 Å. The rhenium LIII EXAFS analysis confirms that rhenium is not completely reduced to metallic rhenium after reduction, with a significant fraction of the rhenium present in low, positive oxidation states and in intimate contact with the support. The EXAFS data are consistent with a structural model where rhenium metal particles are 13 nm wide with smaller platinum particles situated within or at the boundary of the rhenium particles. Moderate heating in the presence of air (i.e., moist) provides the best conditions for transport of mobile rhenium species on the surface, facilitating alloy formation.

该科学文献主要关注在铂-铼/氧化铝重整催化剂中，预处理温度对双金属相互作用的影响，特别是通过使用X射线吸收光谱技术。研究通过同时检查铼LIII和铂LIII的扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）数据来探讨金属功能和金属-支持相互作用之间的区别。结果显示，如果在480°C下还原前，在500°C空气中干燥催化剂，则形成铂和铼的双金属颗粒。高于500°C的温度和空气缺失会抑制表面移动铼物种的传输，从而阻止两种金属之间形成密切接触。铂LIII EXAFS数据显示，催化剂表面上双金属颗粒的平均粒径小于10 Å。铼LIII EXAFS分析表明，在还原后，铼并未完全还原为金属铼，而有一部分铼以较低的正氧化状态存在，并与支撑物紧密接触。EXAFS数据显示，铼金属颗粒宽约13 nm，其中较小的铂颗粒位于或靠近铼颗粒内部。适度加热在空气中（即潮湿）提供最佳条件，促进表面移动铼物种的传输，从而促进合金形成。
