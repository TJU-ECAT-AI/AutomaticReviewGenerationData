[1] "The catalytic reforming of naphtha is usually performed using a bifunctional catalyst containing both a hydrogenating metal and an acid function."
[2] "The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been used as a measure of the platinum dispersion in the catalysts."
[3] "The most common explanation of the properties of the catalyst is based on PtRe alloy formation (5) and the interaction of such an alloy with sulphur (6-9)."
[4] "Hydrogenolysis is a structure-sensitive reaction and has therefore been used as a probe reaction to determine PtRe alloy formation."
[5] "Studies using EDX and TEM (20, 21) conclude that no rhenium can be detected in the platinum particles in the bimetallic system after reduction at 400C, although the yields from reforming experiments indicate that a significant fraction of the rhenium must be present in the metallic state."
[6] "In order to verify that the sealing procedure was successful, some of the samples were reduced in situ using an environmental cell developed by Lytle et al. (28)."
[7] "The volumetric hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed in a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 instrument at 25C."

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions lies in their pivotal role in various chemical industries. These reactions facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing compounds into valuable intermediates or fuels. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies provide insights into the mechanisms, kinetics, and thermodynamics of these reactions, which are crucial for optimizing catalytic processes. In the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, reactor studies often employ batch or continuous flow reactors to mimic industrial conditions. Parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition are systematically varied to understand their impact on product selectivity and yield. 

UHV studies, conducted under vacuum conditions, offer a controlled environment to investigate surface chemistry and reaction pathways at the atomic level. Techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) are employed to characterize the catalyst surfaces and monitor reaction intermediates. These studies can reveal the active sites, reaction rates, and product formation mechanisms, providing a deeper understanding of the catalyst performance under specific conditions.

Both types of studies contribute to the development of more efficient catalysts and reaction conditions, leading to enhanced selectivity and productivity in the chemical industry. For instance, in the synthesis of fuels or hydrogen storage materials, understanding the precise mechanisms of dehydrogenation can lead to the design of catalysts that selectively produce desired products with minimized byproducts. The optimization of these processes through rigorous characterization and kinetic analysis is essential for advancing the fields of chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域具有重要意义。这些反应能够将烃类和含氮化合物转化为有价值的中间体或燃料。反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究为理解这些反应的机制、动力学和热力学提供了见解，这对于优化催化过程至关重要。在支持催化剂上的C-H和N-H键脱氢反应中，反应器研究通常使用批式或连续流动反应器来模拟工业条件。通过系统地改变温度、压力和原料组成参数，以了解它们对产物选择性和产率的影响。

UHV研究在真空条件下进行，提供了一个受控环境来研究表面化学和原子水平的反应路径。使用技术如X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和温度程序脱附（TPD）来表征催化剂表面并监测反应中间体。这些研究可以揭示活性位点、反应速率和产物形成机制，从而提供更深层次的理解催化剂在特定条件下的性能。

这两种类型的研究共同推动了更高效催化剂和反应条件的开发，从而提高化学生产的效率、燃料合成和氢存储材料的生产效率。例如，在燃料合成或氢存储材料合成中，深入理解脱氢机制可以导致设计出选择性产生所需产品且副产品较少的催化剂。通过严格的表征和动力学分析优化这些过程对于推动化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域的进展至关重要。
