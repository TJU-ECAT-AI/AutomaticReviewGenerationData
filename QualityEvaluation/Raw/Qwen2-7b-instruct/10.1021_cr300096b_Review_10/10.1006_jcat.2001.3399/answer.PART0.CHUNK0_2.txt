[1] "The catalytic reforming of naphtha is usually performed using a bifunctional catalyst containing both a hydro- genating metal and an acid function."
[2] "The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been used as a measure of the platinum dis- persion in the catalysts."
[3] "It has been shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts is significantly higher than over its monometallic counterparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12)."
[4] "The most common explanation of the properties of the catalyst is based on PtRe alloy formation (5) and the in- teraction of such an alloy with sulphur (69)."
[5] "The results from the rhenium LIII EXAFS analysis confirm that rhenium is not com- pletely reduced to metallic rhenium after reduction, with a sig- nificant fraction of the rhenium present in low, positive oxidation states and in intimate contact with the support."
[6] "Moderate heating in presence of air (i.e., moist) provides the best conditions for transport of mobile rhenium species on the surface, and hence alloy formation."

The document discusses the influence of pretreatment temperature on the bimetallic interactions in Pt-Re/Al2O3 reforming catalysts, specifically examining the roles of platinum and rhenium. It highlights the importance of the structure and interaction between the two metals for the catalyst's performance, particularly in terms of hydrogenolysis activity and alloy formation. The study uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to analyze the effects of different pretreatment temperatures on the catalyst's properties. The results suggest that moderate heating in the presence of air facilitates the transport of mobile rhenium species, promoting alloy formation between platinum and rhenium. This process is crucial for enhancing the catalyst's performance and stability.
