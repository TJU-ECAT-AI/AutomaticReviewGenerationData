[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous car- bon materials."
[2] "There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients."
[3] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 μm."
[4] "The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materi- als strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used."
[5] "Although the presence of microporosity is required to achieve a high surface area, i.e. a high adsorption capacity, the presence of some mesoporosity is quite often desirable."
[6] "Textural characterization of nanoporous carbon materials is commonly performed using adsorption of probe molecules (He, Ar, N2, CO2, etc.)."

[8] "The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materi- als strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used."
[9] "Microporous carbons can be prepared from a wide variety of lignocellulosic pre- cursors (olive stones, coconut shell, etc.) using either physical (CO2, H2O, etc.) or chemical (H3PO4, ZnCl2, etc.) activation."
[10] "Mesopores are very useful, not only for processes involving larger molecules, but also because they constitute channels for speeding up the access to the inner microporosity."

Analyzing the literature, it becomes evident that NMR methods are crucial tools for studying the structure and properties of porous carbon materials. The combination of NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry allows for a detailed characterization of the pore structure and the interaction of adsorbates with the pore walls. The distribution of nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients indicates the presence of structural heterogeneities within the materials, which can extend up to at least 20 μm in spatial dimensions. The synthesis procedures significantly influence the distribution of micropores and mesopores in carbon materials, with the presence of mesopores often enhancing adsorption capacity and facilitating the access to the inner microporosity. This highlights the importance of understanding the synthesis conditions to tailor the pore structure for specific applications. The textural characterization of carbon materials is commonly performed using adsorption of probe molecules, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of NMR methods in elucidating the properties of these materials.

分析文献，可以清楚地看出NMR方法是研究多孔碳材料结构和性质的关键工具。结合NMR微孔成像、弛豫度量和扩散度量的方法能够对孔结构进行详细表征，并探究吸附剂与孔壁之间的相互作用。核磁共振弛豫率分布和扩散系数的差异表明材料中存在结构异质性，这些异质性的空间范围可能达到至少20 μm。碳材料中微孔和介孔的比例主要取决于合成过程，而介孔的存在往往能提高吸附能力并促进对内层微孔的访问。这突显出理解合成条件的重要性，以适应特定应用来定制孔结构。通过吸附探针分子的纹理表征是碳材料常见的方法，这表明NMR方法在阐明这些材料属性方面的有效性和多样性。
