[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials."
[2] "The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materials strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used."
[3] "There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients."
[4] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 μm."
[5] "The relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene were shorter than in toluene."
[6] "This is due to the stronger polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene."
[7] "The fact that the relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene were shorter than in toluene correlates with the much stronger polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene."
[8] "The diffusion behaviour of several liquids (acetone, ethanol, tol- uene, n-decane and nitrobenzene) confined in MAC-LMA12 was compared."
[9] "Depending on the particular guest, the diffusivities within the pore system are found to be both larger and smaller than the bulk diffusivities."
[10] "The magnitude of p1 increases in proportion with the vapor phase pressure and, hence, also the contribution of the first term in Eq. (15)."

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is profound, as these reactions enable the conversion of hydrocarbon molecules into lighter hydrocarbons, alcohols, or even hydrogen itself. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. These studies typically investigate key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions to optimize catalytic processes.

Reactor studies involve the examination of the kinetics and mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions under industrially relevant conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates. These studies often employ a variety of reactors, including fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, and tubular reactors, to mimic industrial-scale operations. Characterization techniques, such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectroscopic methods (like infrared and Raman spectroscopy), are used to analyze the products and intermediates formed during the reaction.

UHV studies, on the other hand, provide insights into the atomic-level interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants under extremely low-pressure conditions. These studies utilize techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to visualize and quantify the electronic structure and surface chemistry of the catalysts. UHV studies are crucial for understanding the active sites on the catalyst surface and the adsorption and desorption processes of the reactants and products.

In both reactor and UHV studies, the focus is on understanding the role of the catalyst, its support, and the reaction conditions in promoting the desired dehydrogenation reactions. By analyzing the results from these studies, researchers can optimize the catalyst design, selectivity, and efficiency, leading to more sustainable and economically viable processes for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

The diffusion coefficients of the liquids within the pore system of carbon materials like MAC-LMA12 are typically found to be both larger and smaller than the bulk diffusivities of the same liquids. This phenomenon is explained by the presence of the host lattice, which enables guest diffusion through both a liquid phase attached to the pore system and through the free space. Depending on the relative contributions of these two phases, the mean diffusivity observed by PFG NMR may be larger or smaller than the bulk diffusivity, influenced by factors such as vapor phase pressure and the boiling point of the liquid.

The magnitude of p1, the contribution of the fast (gas-phase) mode of molecular propagation, increases in proportion with the vapor phase pressure. This relationship explains why a decrease in the boiling point (and thus a decrease in vapor pressure at a given temperature) leads to a decrease in Dsorbate, the diffusion coefficient of the liquid within the pores. This is consistent with the understanding that the presence of the host lattice affects guest diffusion by facilitating both liquid-phase attachment to the pore system and free-space diffusion.

在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域中，选择性脱氢反应的重要性不言而喻，因为这些反应能够将烃分子转化为较轻的烃类、醇类或甚至氢气。反应器研究和UHV（超高真空）研究对理解这些过程贡献巨大，特别是对于碳材料上支持催化剂的C-H和N-H键脱氢。这些研究通常会调查关键的研究方法、表征技术以及反应条件以优化催化过程。

反应器研究涉及在工业相关条件下（如温度、压力和流速）考察脱氢反应的动力学和机制。这些研究经常采用包括固定床、流化床和管式反应器在内的各种反应器来模拟工业规模的操作。分析产品和中间体的手段包括气相色谱法、质谱法和光谱法（如红外光谱和拉曼光谱），以分析反应过程中形成的物质。

UHV研究提供了在极低压力条件下催化剂表面与反应物之间原子级相互作用的见解。这些研究利用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和角度分辨光发射光谱（ARPES）等技术可视化并量化催化剂的电子结构和表面化学。UHV研究对于理解催化剂表面的活性位点及其吸附和解吸附过程至关重要。

在反应器和UHV研究中，重点在于理解催化剂、其载体以及反应条件如何促进所需的脱氢反应。通过分析这些研究的结果，研究人员可以优化催化剂设计、选择性和效率，从而实现更加可持续且经济高效的化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存过程。

碳材料如MAC-LMA12中的孔隙系统内液体的扩散系数通常发现比相同液体的基态扩散系数更大或更小。这一现象由宿主晶格的存在所解释，它允许客体通过附着到孔隙系统的液相和自由空间进行扩散。根据两种情况的相对贡献，通过PFG NMR观测到的平均扩散系数可能大于或小于基态扩散系数，受因素如蒸汽相压力和液体沸点的影响。

p1的大小，即快速（气相）模式的分子传播贡献，随着蒸汽相压力的增加而增加。这种关系解释了液体在孔隙中扩散系数Dsorbate随液体沸点降低（即在给定温度下蒸汽压力降低）而降低的原因。这与理解宿主晶格影响客体扩散的方式一致，它既促进了液体相与孔隙系统的附着，也促进了自由空间的扩散。
