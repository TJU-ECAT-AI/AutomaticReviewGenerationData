[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous car- bon materials."
[2] "There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients. These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space."
[3] "The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materi- als strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used."
[4] "The two carbon molecular sieves Tak- eda 4A and Tak- eda 5A differentiate from each other by the size of the mouth in the microporous space: 0.4 and 0.5 nm, respectively."
[5] "The relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene were shorter than in toluene correlates with the much stronger polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene."
[6] "This finding complies with the shorter relaxation time observed in Takeda 4A and quantifies the effect of the more severe restriction to diffusion due to the smaller pores in this material, as compared with Takeda 5A."
[7] "The magnitude of p1 increases in proportion with the vapor phase pressure and, hence, also the contribution of the first term in Eq. (15)."

1. The study combined three NMR techniques—cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry—to analyze the structure of porous carbon materials. It revealed that there was a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients, which were linked to variations in the pore space.

2. The type of porosity—micropores and mesopores—in carbon materials largely depends on the synthesis process employed.

3. The carbon molecular sieves Takeda 4A and Takeda 5A had distinct pore openings, measuring 0.4 and 0.5 nm respectively in the microporous region.

4. The shorter relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene in comparison to toluene can be attributed to their higher polarity, leading to stronger surface interactions.

5. The study found that in Takeda 4A, the shorter relaxation times align with the more restricted diffusion due to its smaller pore sizes, compared to Takeda 5A.

6. The amount of p1, which represents the contribution of the fast (gas-phase) mode of molecular propagation, increases in relation to the vapor phase pressure, thereby impacting the overall diffusion process.

1. 研究结合了核磁共振（NMR）的三种技术——渗滤度量、弛豫度量和扩散度量，对多孔碳材料的结构进行了分析。发现核磁共振弛豫率和扩散系数的分布与孔隙空间的变化有关。

2. 碳材料中的孔隙类型（微孔和介孔）主要取决于合成过程。

3. Takeda 4A和Takeda 5A两种分子筛在微孔区域的开口大小不同，分别为0.4nm和0.5nm。

4. 乙醇和硝基苯在与间二甲苯相比时具有更短的弛豫时间，这可以归因于它们更高的极性，导致更强的表面相互作用。

5. 在Takeda 4A中，较短的弛豫时间与更小的孔径大小导致的扩散限制相一致，与Takeda 5A相比。

6. p1的量，代表快速（气态）模式的分子传播贡献，随着蒸气压力的增加而增加，从而影响整个扩散过程。
