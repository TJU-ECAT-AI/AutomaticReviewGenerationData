[3] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 μm."

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, the literature highlights the use of NMR methods for studying porous carbon materials. These methods, combined with cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry, allow for detailed characterization of pore structures and the interaction of adsorbates with pore walls. The distribution of relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients indicates heterogeneity in the pore space, with the spatial extension of these differences estimated to be at least 20 μm. This suggests that the synthesis procedures significantly impact the proportion of micropores and mesopores in carbon materials, influencing their textural properties and performance in adsorption and transport processes. The presence of both microporosity and mesoporosity is crucial for achieving high surface areas and adsorption capacities, with mesoporosity offering advantages for processes involving larger molecules and facilitating access to inner microporosity. NMR techniques are effective tools for understanding the pore characteristics and molecular dynamics in porous carbon materials, contributing to the optimization of catalytic processes in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域，对选择性脱氢反应的意义进行分析时，文献强调了使用NMR方法研究多孔碳材料。这些方法结合了核磁共振、冷冻孔隙度测量、弛豫测量和扩散测量，允许对孔结构进行详细表征，并研究吸附剂与孔壁之间的相互作用。分布的弛豫率和扩散系数表明孔空间的异质性，估计这些差异的空间扩展至少为20微米。这表明合成过程显著影响碳材料中微孔和介孔的比例，影响其纹理性质和吸附和传输过程的表现。存在微孔性和介孔性的比例对于实现高比表面积和吸附能力至关重要，而介孔则提供了处理更大分子的优势，并有助于内微孔的快速访问。NMR技术是理解和研究多孔碳材料孔特性和分子动力学的有效工具，对优化化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域的催化过程具有贡献。
