[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials."
[2] "We demonstrate compatibility between the evidence of classical sorption experiments and NMR cryoporometry on pore size distribution."
[3] "These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space."
[4] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 lm."
[5] "Textural characterization of nanoporous carbon materials is commonly performed using adsorption of probe molecules (He, Ar, N2, CO2, etc.)."
[6] "Although the presence of microporosity is required to achieve a high surface area, i.e. a high adsorption capacity, the presence of some mesoporosity is quite often desirable."
[7] "The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materials strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used."
[8] "The relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene were shorter than in toluene correlates with the much stronger polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene."
[9] "The two constituents of the diffusion attenuation indicate that,over the observation time, the molecules exist in essentially two different dynamical states, as observed already above in context of nuclear magnetic relaxation."
[10] "Depending on the particular guest, the diffusivities within the pore system are found to be both larger and smaller than the bulk diffusivities."

Analyzing the literature, the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is underscored by the critical role of catalysts in facilitating these transformations. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies are instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms underlying these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methods and characterization techniques employed include NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry. These studies typically investigate reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalysts. The findings from these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by providing insights into the structural and dynamic properties of the materials involved. The literature highlights the importance of understanding the heterogeneity of materials and the spatial distribution of structural differences on length scales exceeding the characteristic molecular displacements, which can significantly impact the efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions.

In the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation, the literature demonstrates the influence of molecular polarity on the relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients of adsorbates. The shorter relaxation times of polar molecules like ethanol and nitrobenzene compared to toluene are attributed to stronger surface interactions, which affect the molecular dynamics within the pore systems. This understanding is crucial for optimizing the design of catalysts and reaction conditions to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions.

The studies on the textural characterization of nanoporous carbon materials, which rely on adsorption techniques, reveal the complex interplay between porosity and surface chemistry. The presence of both micropores and mesopores is found to be essential for achieving high surface areas and adsorption capacities. The synthesis procedures used have a significant impact on the proportion of micropores and mesopores, affecting the overall properties of the carbon materials.

The diffusion behavior of various liquids confined within the pore systems of carbon materials is also highlighted. The observed deviations from exponential behavior in diffusion attenuation curves suggest the presence of a broad distribution of diffusivities, attributed to heterogeneities within the materials. This heterogeneity contributes to the selective dehydrogenation reactions by influencing the molecular displacement and interaction patterns, thereby impacting the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions.

Overall, the literature underscores the pivotal role of catalyst design and the characterization of materials' structural and dynamic properties in optimizing selective dehydrogenation reactions. The combination of reactor studies, UHV studies, and advanced characterization techniques provides a comprehensive framework for advancing the field of catalysis in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

分析文献，选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中的重要性被强调，催化剂在促进这些转变中起着关键作用。反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究在阐明这些过程的机制方面至关重要，特别是针对碳基材料上的C-H和N-H键脱氢。主要的研究方法和表征技术包括核磁共振（NMR）透孔度测量、弛豫度测量和扩散测量。这些研究通常会调查反应条件，如温度、压力以及催化剂的性质。这些研究结果通过提供有关材料结构和动力学属性的见解，为催化过程的优化提供了信息。文献强调了理解材料异质性和结构差异空间分布的重要性，这些差异在超过分子位移特征尺度的范围内存在，并对脱氢反应效率产生显著影响。

在C-H和N-H键脱氢的背景下，文献指出极性分子（如乙醇和硝基苯）与非极性分子（如苯甲醚）相比具有更短的弛豫时间，这归因于更强的表面相互作用，从而影响孔内分子的动力学。这种理解对于优化催化剂设计和反应条件以提高脱氢反应的选择性和效率至关重要。

关于纳米多孔碳材料的纹理表征，依赖吸附技术揭示了复杂孔隙结构和表面化学之间的相互作用。微孔和介孔的共存被认为是实现高比表面积和吸附能力的关键。合成方法对微孔和介孔的比例有显著影响，从而影响碳材料的整体特性。

各种液体在碳材料孔系统中的扩散行为也被强调。观察到的衰减曲线偏离指数行为表明扩散系数分布的广泛性，归因于材料内的异质性。这种异质性对选择性脱氢反应产生影响，通过影响分子位移和相互作用模式，进而影响反应的效率和选择性。

总体而言，文献强调了催化剂设计和材料结构和动力学属性表征在优化选择性脱氢反应中的核心作用。结合反应器研究、UHV研究和高级表征技术的方法为推进化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域的催化领域提供了全面框架。
