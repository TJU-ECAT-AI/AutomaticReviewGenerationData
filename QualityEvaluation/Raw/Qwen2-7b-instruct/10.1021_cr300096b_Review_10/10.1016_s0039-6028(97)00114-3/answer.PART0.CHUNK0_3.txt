<p>Commercial supported metal heterogeneous catalysts used for this catalysis, and in particular for hydrocarbon reforming, are bimetallic catalysts, but few fundamental studies have explored the chemisorption of alkenes on bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>The small (C2C5) linear alkenes are all di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) at 100230 K.</p>
<p>Alkylidyne species are the stable products of dehydrogenation of these hydrocarbons on Pt(111) at room temperature.</p>
<p>Determining the coverage of ethylene chemisorbed on Pt(111) at 100 K and of ethylidyne in the (2×2) structure was the subject of some controversy.</p>
<p>The chemistry of this series should be similar. The methyl group inductive effect should not appreciably affect the molecular chemisorption bond strength, that is, the PtC covalent σ bond strength in the adsorbed alkene.</p>
<p>The sticking coefficient curves appeared very similar to those that we have reported previously for cyclohexene on these surfaces, except that we observed a stronger precursor influence (constant sticking coefficient) for C2H4 adsorption on Pt(111) at 100 K compared to cyclohexene adsorption on Pt(111) at 180 K.</p>
<p>For the (2×2) structure, three-fold Pt sites are present but no adjacent three-fold Pt sites are present.</p>
<p>Overall, these sticking coefficient curves appeared very similar to those that we have reported previously for cyclohexene on these surfaces, except that we observed a stronger precursor influence (constant sticking coefficient) for C2H4 adsorption on Pt(111) at 100 K compared to cyclohexene adsorption on Pt(111) at 180 K.</p>
<p>The sticking coefficient curves indicated relative saturation coverages on the three surfaces at 100 K of 0.25, 0.23 and 0.20 ML C2H4 on Pt(111), (2×2) and PtSn surface alloys, respectively, reasonably consistent with the more accurate TPD results above.</p>
<p>One might expect that di-σ-bonded propylene would adsorb at the same sites as those for di-σ-bonded ethylene, giving rise to a similar saturation coverage, unless steric repulsion between the adsorbates due to the larger size of propylene inhibit it.</p>
<p>Alloying Sn with Pt(111) to form the (2×2) and surface alloys has no measurable effect on the initial sticking coefficient of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene compared to clean Pt(111) at low temperatures and no significant effect on the saturation coverage of these molecules in the chemisorbed monolayer on these surfaces.</p>
<p>The similarity in the desorption temperatures (280296 K) for ethylene, propylene and isobutylene on Pt(111) shows that the chemisorption bond strength (via di-σ-bonding) is essentially the same for all three of these molecules; there is no substantial inductive effect on the PtC covalent bond strength due to methyl substitution of ethylene.</p>
<p>The most dramatic effect of alloying Sn is the large reduction in the amount of dehydrogenation that occurs during TPD of alkenes from the PtSn alloys.</p>
<p>No desorption products other than H2 and propylene were found on any of these surfaces.</p>
<p>The extent of irreversible adsorption, that is, the fraction of the chemisorbed monolayer that dehydrogenates to liberate H2 and leave carbon on the surface after TPD, reported in Table 1 can be calculated in two ways.</p>
<p>The strong suppression of alloyed Sn on alkene decomposition seen in Table 1 is plotted in Fig. 14 b.</p>
<p>In addition, the right-hand axis in Fig. 15 gives an estimate of the corresponding desorption activation energy as estimated by Redhead analysis.</p>
<p>Three possible adsorption structures (of many) derived from the LEED pattern that are consistent with the known coverage (0.25 ML) are presented in Fig. 16 bd.</p>

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage involves understanding the role of catalysts, especially bimetallic catalysts, in these processes. This study focuses on the chemisorption of alkenes on PtSn surface alloys and the implications for dehydrogenation reactions. Key research methods include ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and sticking coefficient measurements. Characterization techniques involve determining adsorption kinetics, coverage, and desorption temperatures to understand the reactivity of alkenes on these surfaces. Reaction conditions typically include low temperatures and controlled exposure times to assess the effect of surface composition on dehydrogenation rates. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by revealing how surface chemistry influences reaction pathways, such as the dehydrogenation of alkenes to alkylidyne species, and how bimetallic surfaces can suppress unwanted side reactions like alkene decomposition, enhancing selectivity in chemical production and fuel synthesis.
