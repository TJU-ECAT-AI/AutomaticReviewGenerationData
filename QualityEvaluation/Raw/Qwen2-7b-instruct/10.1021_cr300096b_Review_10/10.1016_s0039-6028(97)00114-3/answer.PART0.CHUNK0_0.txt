[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) to form the (2×2) and surface alloys has no measurable effect on the initial sticking coefficient of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene compared to clean Pt(111) at low temperatures and no significant effect on the saturation coverage of these molecules in the chemisorbed monolayer on these surfaces."
[2] "The extent of irreversible adsorption, that is, the fraction of the chemisorbed monolayer that dehydrogenates to liberate H2 and leave carbon on the surface after TPD, reported in Table 1 can be calculated in two ways."
[3] "Increasing the Sn concentration decreases the desorption temperature, but in a nonlinear fashion."
[4] "We know from our previous HREELS studies [11] that ethylene is also di-σ-bonded on the (2×2) alloy, and so new information on the ethylene structure on the alloy which should be forthcoming may also directly relate to Pt(111) surfaces."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is critical for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies significantly contribute to our understanding of these processes, especially focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.

Reactor studies typically involve operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts. These studies often aim to optimize the reaction pathway, maximize product yield, and minimize byproducts. Characterization techniques include GC (Gas Chromatography), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), and XRD (X-ray Diffraction) to analyze product composition and catalyst activity over time.

UHV studies offer insights into the surface chemistry of the catalysts and the reaction mechanisms at the atomic level. Key methods include LEED (Low Energy Electron Diffraction), XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). These studies are crucial for understanding the structure-reactivity relationships and the dynamics of the dehydrogenation reactions.

In both types of studies, researchers focus on the effects of various parameters on the selectivity and efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions. By comparing results from reactor studies and UHV studies, scientists can gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

The research methods and characterization techniques employed in reactor and UHV studies provide valuable information for optimizing catalytic processes in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. This knowledge is essential for advancing technologies in these fields, contributing to sustainable and efficient industrial practices.

在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域中，分析选择性的脱氢反应具有重要意义。反应器研究和UHV（超高真空）研究对理解这些过程做出了重大贡献，特别是关注于在支持催化剂上进行的C-H和N-H键脱氢。

反应器研究通常涉及的操作条件包括温度、压力以及催化剂的存在。这些研究往往旨在优化反应途径、最大化产物产率并最小化副产品。分析技术包括GC（气相色谱）、FTIR（傅里叶变换红外光谱）和XRD（X射线衍射），用于分析产物组成和催化剂随时间的活性。

UHV研究提供了关于催化剂表面化学和原子水平上反应机制的见解。关键方法包括LEED（低能电子衍射）、XPS（X射线光电子谱）和AES（俄歇电子谱）。这些研究对于理解结构-反应性关系和脱氢反应动力学至关重要。

在两种类型的研究中，研究人员专注于各种参数对脱氢反应选择性和效率的影响。通过比较反应器研究和UHV研究的结果，科学家可以全面了解其背后的机制，从而促进更高效、选择性更强的催化剂的发展。

反应器研究和UHV研究中采用的方法和技术提供了有关化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域的催化剂优化的宝贵信息。这种知识对于推进这些领域中的技术发展至关重要，有助于实现可持续和高效的工业实践。
