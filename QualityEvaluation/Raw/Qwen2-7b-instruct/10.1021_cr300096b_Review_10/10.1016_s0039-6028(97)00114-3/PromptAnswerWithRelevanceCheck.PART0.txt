Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is critical for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies significantly contribute to our understanding of these processes, especially focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.

Reactor studies typically involve operating conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts. These studies often aim to optimize the reaction pathway, maximize product yield, and minimize byproducts.

<p>The most dramatic effect of alloying Sn into Pt is the large reduction in the amount of dehydrogenation that occurs during TPD of alkenes from the PtSn alloys. In all cases, including in the presence of relatively weak allylic CH bonds, only ca. 4% of the chemisorbed monolayer of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene decomposes on the (2×2) alloy and no decomposition occurs on the alloy. Elimination of adjacent Pt-only three-fold hollow sites on the (2×2) alloy suppresses >90% of the amount of decomposition on Pt(111), implicating adjacent Pt three-fold hollow sites as a key ensemble requirement for alkene decomposition.</p>

These studies employ techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and sticking coefficient measurements to investigate adsorption, desorption, and reaction kinetics of hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces. They help elucidate the structure-reactivity relationships, the formation and stability of adsorbates, and the energetics of dehydrogenation reactions.

Key research methods typically include:

1. **Kinetic studies** to determine reaction rates and activation energies.
2. **Adsorption and desorption studies** to understand adsorbate interactions with catalyst surfaces.
3. **Surface characterization techniques** like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) to analyze surface compositions and structures.
4. **Quantitative analysis** of desorption products to identify reaction pathways and intermediates.

<p>The most dramatic effect of alloying Sn is the large reduction in the amount of dehydrogenation that occurs during TPD of alkenes from the PtSn alloys.</p>
<p>No desorption products other than H2 and propylene were found on any of these surfaces.</p>
