<p>Commercial supported metal heterogeneous catalysts used for this catalysis, and in particular for hydrocarbon reforming, are bimetallic catalysts, but few fundamental studies have explored the chemisorption of alkenes on bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>Considering propylene and isobutylene as methyl-substituted ethylene reveals a small trend toward decreasing adsorption energy and on all of these surfaces as the amount of methyl substitution increases.</p>
<p>One might expect higher reactivity for both propylene and isobutylene compared to ethylene since these molecules have allylic CH bonds that are ca. 22 kcal mol1 weaker than the vinylic CH bonds in ethylene.</p>
<p>The extent of irreversible adsorption, that is, the fraction of the chemisorbed monolayer that dehydrogenates to liberate H2 and leave carbon on the surface after TPD, reported in Table 1 can be calculated in two ways.</p>
<p>Elimination of adjacent Pt-only three-fold hollow sites on the (2×2) alloy suppresses >90% of the amount of decomposition on Pt(111), implicating adjacent Pt three-fold hollow sites as a key ensemble requirement for alkene decomposition.</p>

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. This process involves the controlled breaking of C-H or N-H bonds in molecules to generate useful products or release hydrogen. Reactor studies and ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies are instrumental in understanding these reactions, especially over supported catalysts.

Reactor studies often involve setting up continuous flow systems to mimic industrial conditions, where researchers can precisely control variables like temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading to optimize the dehydrogenation process. These studies typically focus on identifying the most effective catalysts, understanding reaction kinetics, and determining optimal operating conditions.

UHV studies, conducted in ultra-clean environments, provide insights into the molecular-level interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces. These studies often utilize techniques like low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to characterize surface structures and monitor reaction pathways. Key areas of investigation include the adsorption behavior of reactants, the nature of active sites on the catalyst, and the mechanisms of bond breaking.

The significance of these studies lies in their ability to elucidate the fundamental principles governing dehydrogenation reactions. This knowledge enables the design of more efficient catalysts, the development of novel reaction pathways, and the optimization of industrial processes. By understanding how different factors influence reaction outcomes, researchers can tailor catalysts and reaction conditions to achieve desired product yields and efficiencies, ultimately contributing to advancements in energy and materials science.

In summary, reactor studies offer practical insights into industrial-scale operations, while UHV studies provide a detailed, microscopic understanding of reaction mechanisms. Together, these methodologies inform the optimization of catalytic processes for the selective dehydrogenation of molecules, a critical area in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.
