<p>The most dramatic effect of alloying Sn into Pt is the large reduction in the amount of dehydrogenation that occurs during TPD of alkenes from the PtSn alloys. In all cases, including in the presence of relatively weak allylic CH bonds, only ca. 4% of the chemisorbed monolayer of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene decomposes on the (2×2) alloy and no decomposition occurs on the alloy. Elimination of adjacent Pt-only three-fold hollow sites on the (2×2) alloy suppresses >90% of the amount of decomposition on Pt(111), implicating adjacent Pt three-fold hollow sites as a key ensemble requirement for alkene decomposition.</p>

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions lies in their critical roles in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions enable the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable products, such as alcohols, olefins, and aromatics, and are crucial for the production of fuels like gasoline and diesel. In hydrogen storage, dehydrogenation is used to release hydrogen from stored compounds, facilitating its transport and utilization. 

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes. Reactor studies focus on the practical aspects of catalytic reactions under industrially relevant conditions, examining factors such as reaction rates, selectivities, and catalyst stability. These studies often involve the use of batch or continuous flow reactors, where the effects of temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition on product yields and reaction pathways are systematically varied.

UHV studies, conducted under ultra-high vacuum conditions, provide detailed insights into the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions at the molecular level. These studies employ techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and sticking coefficient measurements to investigate adsorption, desorption, and reaction kinetics of hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces. They help elucidate the structure-reactivity relationships, the formation and stability of adsorbates, and the energetics of dehydrogenation reactions.

Key research methods typically include:

1. **Kinetic studies** to determine reaction rates and activation energies.
2. **Adsorption and desorption studies** to understand adsorbate interactions with catalyst surfaces.
3. **Surface characterization techniques** like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) to analyze surface compositions and structures.
4. **Quantitative analysis** of desorption products to identify reaction pathways and intermediates.

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most active and selective catalysts, determining optimal reaction conditions, and revealing the underlying mechanisms that govern the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions. This knowledge is essential for the development of more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable methods for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage technologies.
