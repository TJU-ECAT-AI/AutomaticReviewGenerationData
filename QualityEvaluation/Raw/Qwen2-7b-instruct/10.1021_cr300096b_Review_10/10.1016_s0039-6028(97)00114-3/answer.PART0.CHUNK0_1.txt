[1] "The formation of specific, ordered alloy surfaces may give us a general tool for imposing order in molecular adlayers on reactive surfaces, thereby allowing us to bring to bear powerful probes of surface structure such as LEED that cannot be used on the unalloyed surface."
[2] "The most dramatic effect of alloying Sn into Pt is the large reduction in the amount of dehydrogenation that occurs during TPD of alkenes from the PtSn alloys."
[3] "The similarity in the desorption temperatures (280296 K) for ethylene, propylene and isobutylene on Pt(111) shows that the chemisorption bond strength (via di-σ-bonding) is essentially the same for all three of these molecules."
[4] "The influence of alloyed Sn on alkene adsorption and dehydrogenation is the small effect on the initial sticking coefficient of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene compared to clean Pt(111) at low temperatures and no significant effect on the saturation coverage of these molecules in the chemisorbed monolayer on these surfaces."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is crucial in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These processes enable the conversion of hydrocarbons and hydrogen-rich compounds into valuable chemicals and fuels, while the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage materials is essential for the development of efficient hydrogen storage technologies. 

Reactor studies and UHV studies both contribute significantly to our understanding of dehydrogenation processes, but they focus on different aspects. Reactor studies often employ real-world conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures, to simulate industrial processes. These studies help optimize catalyst performance, reaction pathways, and process parameters. Characterization techniques commonly used include gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and infrared spectroscopy.

UHV studies, conducted in ultra-high vacuum environments, offer unparalleled insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. Techniques like low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) allow researchers to investigate surface chemistry, bonding dynamics, and reaction intermediates in great detail. These studies often focus on the adsorption and reaction of molecules on solid surfaces, providing a foundation for the development of more efficient catalysts and understanding of reaction kinetics.

Both types of studies are complementary, with reactor studies informing practical applications and UHV studies guiding fundamental research. Together, they advance our understanding of dehydrogenation reactions, enabling the design of more effective catalysts and processes for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

In summary, selective dehydrogenation reactions are pivotal for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The combination of reactor and UHV studies offers a comprehensive approach to optimizing catalysts and understanding reaction mechanisms, contributing to advancements in these fields.

在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域，选择性脱氢反应至关重要。这些过程使烃类和富含氢的化合物转化为有价值的化学品和燃料，而氢存储材料的脱氢则是高效氢存储技术发展的关键。

反应器研究与UHV（超高压）研究都对理解脱氢过程做出了重要贡献，但它们关注的方面不同。反应器研究通常采用接近工业条件的高温和高压环境，旨在模拟实际过程。这些研究有助于优化催化剂性能、反应途径和工艺参数。常用的表征技术包括气相色谱法、质谱法和红外光谱法。

UHV研究在超高压环境中进行，提供了深入理解脱氢反应原子尺度机制的独特视角。低能电子衍射（LEED）、Auger电子能谱（AES）和温度程序脱附（TPD）等技术允许研究人员详细研究表面化学、键动态和反应中间体。这些研究往往集中在固体表面分子的吸附和反应上，为开发更有效的催化剂和理解反应动力学提供了基础。

这两种类型的研究相辅相成，反应器研究为实际应用提供指导，而UHV研究推动了基本研究的发展。它们共同促进了脱氢反应的理解，使设计更高效的催化剂和过程成为可能，从而推动化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域的进步。
