[1] "The adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and the p(2×2) and (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys were investigated with temperature programmed desorption, Auger electron spectroscopy and low energy electron diffraction."
[2] "Methylacetylene reaction also leads to a small amount of desorption of benzene, along with butane, butene, isobutylene and ethylene."
[3] "Despite previous experiments showing cyclotrimerization of acetylene to form benzene on the PtSn surface alloys, the analogous reaction of methylacetylene on the alloy surfaces was not observed."
[4] "The yield of these other reaction products depending the Sn concentration, with the (2×2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy having the highest selectivity for these."
[5] "It is proposed that this and the high yield of propylene is due to facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene because of the relatively weak HCH2CCH bond compared to acetylene."
[6] "The correspondence between the desorption temperature of methylacetylene and the onset of propylene desorption on the alloys might indicate that the desorption of methylacetylene frees up sites necessary for the subsequent hydrogenation of methylacetylene."

The selective dehydrogenation reactions, particularly the facile dehydrogenation of methylacetylene on surface alloys, play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The process allows for the efficient conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable products such as propylene, which can be further processed into various chemical compounds and fuels. Reactor studies and UHV studies are pivotal in understanding these processes. These studies typically investigate the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts, as well as employ characterization techniques like temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to monitor the adsorption, reaction, and desorption processes. The insights gained from these methodologies enable the optimization of catalytic processes, ensuring more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods. The high yield of propylene observed on certain surface alloys suggests that the ease of dehydrogenation, influenced by factors such as the type of catalyst, contributes significantly to the selectivity and efficiency of the reaction pathways. The correspondence between the desorption temperature of methylacetylene and the onset of propylene desorption indicates that the liberation of sites for hydrogenation is facilitated by the initial dehydrogenation step, highlighting the importance of selective dehydrogenation in the overall chemical transformation processes.
