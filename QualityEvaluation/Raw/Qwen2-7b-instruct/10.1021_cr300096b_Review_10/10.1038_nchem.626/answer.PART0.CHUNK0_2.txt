<p>Ammonia can be liquefied easily at a pressure of 8 atm at 293 K, leading to high energy densities.</p>
<p>Although Ru has the optimal heat of chemisorption among single metals, it is expensive and limited in supply; hence there is a need to develop either less expensive alternatives or catalysts with higher activity.</p>
<p>The ammonia decomposition reaction was used in the current study as a test system due to the relative simplicity of the molecule and the decomposition reaction pathways.</p>
<p>Because the nitrogen binding energy is a good activity descriptor, a DFT search was performed to identify catalyst surfaces that have a similar binding energy to the optimal value of 134 kcal mol1.</p>
<p>At the peak of the volcano curve (134 kcal mol1), the removal of the second hydrogen is the most significant elementary reaction step, although the removal of the first hydrogen and nitrogen desorption are both kinetically significant.</p>
<p>The NiPtPt bimetallic surface was predicted to be very active for the ammonia decomposition reaction; this was confirmed by experimental measurements using TPD and HREELS.</p>
<p>Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models.</p>

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, we observe that these reactions play a pivotal role in the conversion of hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds into valuable products. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to our understanding of these processes by elucidating the mechanisms and kinetics involved in the breaking of C-H and N-H bonds over supported catalysts. Key research methods involve modeling with microkinetic models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS).

In reactor studies, the focus is on optimizing conditions such as temperature, pressure, and flow rates to maximize yield and selectivity. UHV studies, on the other hand, enable precise control over surface chemistry and adsorbate configurations, providing insights into the fundamental interactions that govern reaction pathways. Characterization techniques like Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy are crucial for monitoring the state of the catalyst and the nature of the adsorbates.

These studies collectively inform the development of more efficient and cost-effective catalytic processes, enabling the production of fuels and hydrogen with reduced environmental impact. By identifying active catalysts with the right surface properties and kinetic profiles, researchers can tailor catalysts for specific applications, enhancing the economic viability and sustainability of chemical manufacturing processes.

In summary, the combination of theoretical modeling and experimental validation provides a comprehensive approach to optimizing selective dehydrogenation reactions, driving advancements in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage technologies.
