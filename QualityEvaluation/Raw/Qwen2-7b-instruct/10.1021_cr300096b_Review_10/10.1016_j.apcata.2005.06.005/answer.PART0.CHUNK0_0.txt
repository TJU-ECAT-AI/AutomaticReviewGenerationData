[1] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "As an example, the platinumtin system supported on alumina is widely used in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation reactions, where it exhibits higher activity and stability than monometallic platinum catalysts [1] ."
[3] "In the field of selective hydrogenations, Consonni et al. have studied Pt/Zn catalysts in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, and they concluded that the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol) increased with the extent of alloy formation [24] ."
[4] "For this latter reaction, it has been shown that the catalytic performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and tin species, both in the metallic state and in oxidised states."
[5] "This means that whereas on Pt catalysts, the adsorption trough the CC double bond is highly favoured, on PtZn catalysts, the adsorption of the carbonyl bond on PtZn bridge sites is able to compete with that of the CC double bond."
[6] "The results were explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal."
[7] "Furthermore, ZnO has n-type semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction between platinum and ZnO can be expected."
[8] "The higher selectivity of the bimetallic PtZn/C catalysts towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, as compared with that of the monometallic counterpart (which only produces butanal and light hydrocarbons), can be attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."
[9] "The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve breaking of C-H and N-H bonds, which are essential steps in the production of various chemicals, fuels, and the utilization of hydrogen as a storage medium. Research methods typically involve reactor studies, where the catalysts are operated under specific conditions to optimize their performance. UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies are utilized to understand the detailed mechanisms of these reactions at the molecular level, providing insights into the structure-reactivity relationships and the electronic properties of the catalysts.

Characterization techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) are used to analyze the catalysts' properties before and after the reaction. These methods help to identify the formation of alloy phases, the presence of surface species, and the interaction between metals. Reaction conditions like temperature, pressure, and the presence of inhibitors or promoters are systematically varied to optimize the catalyst's performance.

The studies reveal that the addition of a second metal can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, the presence of zinc in a platinum-based catalyst improves the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol, demonstrating the importance of alloy formation. Moreover, the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles is critical in improving the catalytic properties, especially in iso-butane dehydrogenation, where the catalysts exhibit higher activity, selectivity, and stability.

In summary, selective dehydrogenation reactions are pivotal in chemical engineering, and advanced studies combining reactor and UHV techniques, along with detailed characterization, help in optimizing catalysts for industrial applications, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of chemical production and hydrogen storage.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域中起着至关重要的作用。这些反应涉及C-H和N-H键的断裂，这是生产各种化学品、燃料以及利用氢气作为存储介质的关键步骤。通常的研究方法包括反应器研究，其中通过特定条件操作催化剂以优化其性能。UHV（超高真空）研究用于在分子水平上理解这些反应的机制，提供了有关催化剂结构与活性关系和电子性质的见解。

表征技术如温度程序还原（TPR）、吸附微热流计法、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和阿格耳电子能谱（AES）被用来分析催化剂在反应前后的性质。这些方法有助于识别合金相的形成、表面物种的存在以及金属之间的相互作用。反应条件如温度、压力以及抑制剂或促进剂的存在被系统地改变，以优化催化剂的性能。

研究表明，添加第二种金属可以显著提高催化活性和选择性。例如，在铂基催化剂中加入锌可以改善丙酮醛的氢化为丙烯醇，这表明合金形成的重要性。此外，铂锌二元合金粒子的形成对于提高催化性能至关重要，尤其是在异丁烷脱氢过程中，催化剂显示出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

总之，选择性脱氢反应对于化学工程至关重要，并结合反应器和UHV技术以及详细表征的研究有助于优化工业应用中的催化剂，从而提高化学生产和氢存储的效率和可持续性。
