          Selective dehydrogenation reactions are pivotal in various industrial applications, including chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Catalyst studies, particularly those employing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques, significantly advance our understanding of these processes. Common research methods involve examining the dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds over supported catalysts. Characterization techniques, such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and adsorption microcalorimetry, are utilized to analyze catalyst behavior. Careful control of reaction conditions optimizes catalytic processes. These studies provide insights into enhancing catalyst performance and selectivity. UHV studies enable detailed analysis of surface reactions, facilitating catalyst design and improvement. Optimizing catalytic processes requires a deep understanding of dehydrogenation reaction mechanisms. By assessing the efficacy of various catalysts and conditions, researchers can customize processes for specific applications.

          [1] "The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."
          [2] "Deactivation in this kind of reactions is due to side reactions (mainly isomerization and cracking) which produce blocking of active sites by coke deposition."
          [3] "In the case of Pt/C, deposition of carbon would be responsible of the strong deactivation observed."
          [4] "Also, the increase in selectivity in this sample with time on stream can be explained by the same geometrics arguments."
          [5] "In the case of iso-butane dehydrogenation, the bimetallic catalyst was much more active than the monometallic one, exhibiting a 100% selectivity towards the dehydrogenated product, iso-butene."

          The improvement in catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts can be attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles, which reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, suppresses undesired reactions, and enhances selectivity and stability. Deactivation in these reactions often occurs due to side reactions, primarily isomerization and cracking, leading to the blocking of active sites through coke deposition. In the case of Pt/C catalysts, carbon deposition causes significant deactivation. The increase in selectivity over time can be explained by geometric considerations. Specifically, in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane, the bimetallic catalyst exhibited much higher activity than the monometallic catalyst, achieving 100% selectivity for the dehydrogenated product, iso-butene.

          双金属催化剂相对于单一金属催化剂在催化性能上的改进可以归因于PtZn双金属颗粒的形成，这减少了表面铂簇的大小，抑制了不希望的反应，提高了选择性和稳定性。在这些反应中，脱活通常由于副反应引起，主要是异构化和裂解，导致活性位点被焦炭沉积堵塞。对于Pt/C催化剂，碳沉积导致明显的脱活。随着时间的增加，选择性的提高可以用几何考虑来解释。具体来说，在异丁烷脱氢过程中，双金属催化剂的活性远高于单金属催化剂，实现了100%的选择性，用于脱氢产物异丁烯。
