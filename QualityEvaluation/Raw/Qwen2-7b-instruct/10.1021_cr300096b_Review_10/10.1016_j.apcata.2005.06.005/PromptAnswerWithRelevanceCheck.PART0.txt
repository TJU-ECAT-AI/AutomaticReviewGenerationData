[1] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "As an example, the platinumtin system supported on alumina is widely used in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation reactions, where it exhibits higher activity and stability than monometallic platinum catalysts [1] ."
[3] "In the field of selective hydrogenations, Consonni et al. have studied Pt/Zn catalysts in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, and they concluded that the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol) increased with the extent of alloy formation [24] ."
[4] "For this latter reaction, it has been shown that the catalytic performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and tin species, both in the metallic state and in oxidised states."
[5] "This means that whereas on Pt catalysts, the adsorption trough the CC double bond is highly favoured, on PtZn catalysts, the adsorption of the carbonyl bond on PtZn bridge sites is able to compete with that of the CC double bond."
[6] "The results were explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal."
[7] "Furthermore, ZnO has n-type semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction between platinum and ZnO can be expected."
[8] "The higher selectivity of the bimetallic PtZn/C catalysts towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, as compared with that of the monometallic counterpart (which only produces butanal and light hydrocarbons), can be attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."
[9] "The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve breaking of C-H and N-H bonds, which are essential steps in the production of various chemicals, fuels, and the utilization of hydrogen as a storage medium. Research methods typically involve reactor studies, where the catalysts are operated under specific conditions to optimize their performance. UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies are utilized to understand the detailed mechanisms of these reactions at the molecular level, providing insights into the structure-reactivity relationships and the electronic properties of the catalysts.

Characterization techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) are used to analyze the catalysts' properties before and after the reaction. These methods help to identify the formation of alloy phases, the presence of surface species, and the interaction between metals. Reaction conditions like temperature, pressure, and the presence of inhibitors or promoters are systematically varied to optimize the catalyst's performance.

The studies reveal that the addition of a second metal can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, the presence of zinc in a platinum-based catalyst improves the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol, demonstrating the importance of alloy formation. Moreover, the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles is critical in improving the catalytic properties, especially in iso-butane dehydrogenation, where the catalysts exhibit higher activity, selectivity, and stability.

In summary, selective dehydrogenation reactions are pivotal in chemical engineering, and advanced studies combining reactor and UHV techniques, along with detailed characterization, help in optimizing catalysts for industrial applications, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of chemical production and hydrogen storage.

<p>The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles. Deactivation in this kind of reactions is due to side reactions (mainly isomerization and cracking) which produce blocking of active sites by coke deposition. It has been probed that these side reactions require large platinum ensembles to constitute the active sites [12] ,[37] . In contrast, kinetic results suggest that dehydrogenation reactions can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms [12] . Thus, the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles (based on TPR and microcalorimetry results) reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles, suppresses the undesired reactions and enhances selectivity and stability. In the case of Pt/C, deposition of carbon would be responsible of the strong deactivation observed. Also, the increase in selectivity in this sample with time on stream can be explained by the same geometrics arguments. The carbon deposits play the role of the inactive species that inhibit undesired reactions. Thus, both the selectivity and stability of the catalyst improve as a function of time on stream as the number of large ensembles is reduced by the presence of carbon.</p>
<p>In the case of iso-butane dehydrogenation, the bimetallic catalyst was much more active than the monometallic one, exhibiting a 100% selectivity towards the dehydrogenated product, iso-butene.</p>

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage because they enable the conversion of complex hydrocarbon molecules into simpler, more valuable products. These reactions involve breaking C-H and N-H bonds, which can lead to the production of lighter hydrocarbons, alcohols, or even ammonia. In the context of this literature, the selective dehydrogenation of iso-butane demonstrates a significant improvement in catalyst efficiency, achieving a 100% selectivity for the desired product, iso-butene. This highlights the importance of developing catalysts that can selectively convert feedstocks while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

Reactor studies and UHV studies are essential tools in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes. Reactor studies, as described in the literature, involve the examination of reaction kinetics and mechanisms under various conditions. These studies often focus on parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition to determine the optimal conditions for a reaction. Characterization techniques like temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provide insights into the catalyst's structure and activity. These methods help researchers understand how the catalyst's properties change during the reaction and correlate these changes with the reaction outcomes.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer a controlled environment for examining surface reactions at the atomic scale. By using ultra-high vacuum conditions, researchers can minimize the effects of impurities and study the fundamental interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces. Techniques like XPS and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) are particularly useful in these studies, as they provide detailed information about the surface chemistry and composition. Together, reactor and UHV studies provide a comprehensive understanding of catalytic processes, enabling the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for various industrial applications.

In summary, selective dehydrogenation reactions play a pivotal role in chemical production and fuel synthesis, and advanced characterization techniques combined with reactor studies are indispensable for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing process efficiency. The literature presented showcases the benefits of using bimetallic catalysts, which exhibit improved activity and selectivity, particularly in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, by forming PtZn bimetallic particles that reduce the size of platinum ensembles and suppress undesired reactions.
