[1] "Increasing the number of CC double bonds in these linear C6 hydrocarbons served, in general, to decrease the monolayer saturation coverage of these molecules on Pt(111) and the two alloy surfaces."
[2] "The most significant alteration caused by alloying Sn was on the dehydrogenation activity of the alloys for both 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene. The amount of dehydrogenation that occurred during heating in TPD measurements of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene monolayers was reduced from 65 and 100% on Pt(111) to 18 and 30% on the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, respectively."
[3] "Decreased 1-hexene dehydrogenation activity on PtSn alloys increases the selectivity for gas-phase 1-hexene production and also increases the catalyst lifetime by reducing carbon buildup due to nonspecific dehydrogenation that gradually poisons the catalyst surface."
[4] "Alloying Sn into the Pt(111) surface greatly suppressed the dehydrogenation of 1,5-hexadiene compared with that on the clean Pt(111) surface."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions is pivotal in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage as it facilitates the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable products like alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics. The optimization of these processes relies heavily on understanding the reactivity and selectivity of supported catalysts. 

Reactor studies involve observing the reaction dynamics under real-world conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of impurities. This helps in assessing the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts in converting feedstocks into desired products. Ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies, on the other hand, are conducted under extremely low pressures to simulate conditions akin to those at the surface of catalysts in industrial reactors. These studies often focus on the adsorption, reaction, and desorption of molecules to gain insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing the catalytic activity.

Characterization techniques used in these studies include temperature programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to monitor the surface composition and the nature of the adsorbed species. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, are carefully controlled to mimic industrial settings and to identify the optimal conditions for maximum yield and selectivity.

The findings from these studies inform the design and optimization of catalytic processes by providing data on the adsorption energies, reaction barriers, and product yields. For instance, the decrease in monolayer saturation coverage with the introduction of CC double bonds suggests that the site requirements for strong chemisorption bonding increase, leading to less tightly packed monolayers. This information can guide the selection of appropriate catalysts and operating conditions to maximize the desired product formation while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

Alloying metals like Sn with Pt can significantly alter the catalytic properties, affecting both the adsorption and reactivity of molecules. The suppression of dehydrogenation activity on PtSn alloys demonstrates the potential for enhancing the selectivity and longevity of catalysts, thereby improving the efficiency of chemical production processes. These insights from reactor and UHV studies are crucial for advancing the field of catalysis and optimizing industrial-scale chemical manufacturing.

分析选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域中至关重要，因为它促进了碳氢化合物向有价值的产物如烯烃、烷烃和芳香族化合物的转化。优化这些过程依赖于对支持催化剂活性和选择性的理解。

反应器研究涉及在实际条件下观察反应动力学，包括温度、压力和杂质的存在。这有助于评估催化剂在将原料转化为所需产品时的效率和选择性。超真空（UHV）研究是在极低压力下进行的，以模拟催化剂表面条件下的情况。这些研究通常集中在吸附、反应和脱附分子上，以深入了解催化活性的基本机制。

用于这些研究的表征技术包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和原子发射光谱（AES），以监测表面组成和吸附物种的性质。控制反应条件，如温度和压力，以模仿工业设置，并确定最大化所需产品形成和最小化非特定副反应的最佳条件。

这些研究的发现通过提供吸附能、反应势垒和产率的数据，指导催化剂设计和优化过程。例如，双键数量的增加导致单层饱和覆盖度降低表明，为了实现强化学吸附键合，需要更多的位点，导致更松散的单层排列。这些信息可以指导选择合适的催化剂和操作条件，以最大化所需的产物形成，同时最小化意外反应。

通过Sn与Pt合金化可以显著改变金属的催化特性，影响分子的吸附性和反应性。PtSn合金中脱氢活性的抑制显示了增强选择性和催化剂寿命的可能性，从而提高化学生产的效率。这些来自反应器和UHV研究的见解对于推进催化领域并优化工业规模的化学制造至关重要。
