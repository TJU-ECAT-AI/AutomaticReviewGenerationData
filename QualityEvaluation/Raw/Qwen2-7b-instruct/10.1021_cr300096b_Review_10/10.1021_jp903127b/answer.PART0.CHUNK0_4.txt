[1] "Increasing the number of CC double bonds in these linear C6 hydrocarbons served, in general, to decrease the monolayer saturation coverage of these molecules on Pt(111) and the two alloy surfaces."
[2] "We explained (in section 4.2 using Figure 12) that this change could be accounted for by the loss of pure-Pt 3-fold hollow sites on the 3 alloy and their importance in activating the CH bond breaking required for dehydrogenation."

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions lies in their pivotal role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons into more valuable chemicals or fuels, and they are crucial for the efficient operation of hydrogen storage systems. The selective dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene, over supported catalysts enables the formation of desired products like alkenes and alkanes, which are essential components in various industries.

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the mechanisms of selective dehydrogenation. In reactor studies, researchers can simulate industrial conditions to test the performance of catalysts under real-world scenarios. This helps in optimizing the design and operation of reactors for maximum efficiency and selectivity.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer a more controlled environment where the surface chemistry of catalysts can be precisely analyzed. These studies involve examining the adsorption, desorption, and reactivity of molecules like n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene on surfaces like Pt(111), (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111), and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloys. Techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) allow for the determination of adsorption energies, reaction pathways, and the influence of alloy composition on the reactivity of the catalyst.

Characterization techniques used in these studies include reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and mass spectrometry (MS). These methods provide detailed information on the structure of the catalyst, the nature of the reactions occurring, and the yield of products. Reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the type of feedstock, are systematically varied to understand their impact on the dehydrogenation process and to optimize the catalyst for specific applications.

The findings from reactor and UHV studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by revealing the critical factors that influence the efficiency and selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions. This knowledge is essential for developing more effective catalysts, improving reaction conditions, and enhancing the overall performance of industrial processes related to chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域具有重要意义。这些反应能够将烃类转化为更有价值的化学品或燃料，并且对于高效氢存储系统至关重要。对线性C6烃分子（如己烷、己烯和己二烯）的选择性脱氢，通过支持催化剂实现，能够形成所需的产物如烯烃和烷烃，这些都是各个行业的重要组成部分。

反应器研究和超高真空(UHV)研究对理解这些过程提供了关键信息。在反应器研究中，研究人员可以模拟工业条件来测试催化剂在实际场景下的性能。这有助于优化反应器设计和操作以实现最大效率和选择性。

相比之下，UHV研究提供了一个更为可控的环境，用于精确分析催化剂表面化学。这些研究涉及检查像Pt(111)、(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111)和(3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金表面上的分子（如己烷、己烯和己二烯）的吸附、解吸和反应路径。技术如温度程序脱附(TPD)和原子发射光谱(AES)允许确定吸附能、反应途径以及合金组成对催化剂活性的影响。

用于这些研究的表征技术包括反射吸收红外光谱(RAIRS)、热重分析(TGA)和质谱(MS)。这些方法提供了关于催化剂结构、反应发生性质以及产物产率的详细信息。反应条件，如温度、压力和原料类型，被系统地改变以了解它们对脱氢过程的影响，并优化催化剂以满足特定应用需求。

从反应器和UHV研究中获得的知识指导了催化过程的优化，揭示了影响脱氢反应效率和选择性的关键因素。这种知识对于开发更有效的催化剂、改善反应条件以及提高与化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储相关的工业过程的整体性能至关重要。
