[1] "Direct and hexatriene pathways for benzene formation have long been a matter of dispute."
[2] "Hexenes, (6) hexadienes, (7) and hexatriene (8) from stepwise dehydrocyclization of hexane on Pt black have been observed as reaction intermediates, even in the presence of excess hydrogen."
[3] "Adding catalytically inactive Sn has been considered to dilute contiguous Pt sites at the bimetallic surface to create smaller ensembles favorable for nondegradative reactions and decreasing the CH and CC bond breaking activity of Pt in catalysts used for reforming reactions."
[4] "Our results show that Sn on these two alloys has no site-blocking effect on the initial elementary step in the catalysis of alkane conversion, that is, adsorption of the alkane reactant as probed here by n-hexane adsorption at low temperatures."
[5] "Decreased 1-hexene dehydrogenation activity on PtSn alloys increases the selectivity for gas-phase 1-hexene production and also increases the catalyst lifetime by reducing carbon buildup due to nonspecific dehydrogenation that gradually poisons the catalyst surface."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve the breaking of C-H and N-H bonds, which are fundamental in creating various chemical compounds. The selective dehydrogenation process helps in enhancing the efficiency of chemical production by avoiding unwanted side reactions. In fuel synthesis, it enables the creation of high-octane gasoline components and diesel fuels. For hydrogen storage, selective dehydrogenation reactions can be used to generate hydrogen gas from hydrocarbon feedstocks, which is a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach.

Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies are essential tools in understanding selective dehydrogenation reactions. Reactor studies allow for the investigation of reaction kinetics, selectivity, and product yields under real-world conditions. These studies often involve the use of pilot-scale reactors and continuous flow systems, which mimic industrial processes. UHV studies, on the other hand, are conducted under vacuum conditions to isolate the surface chemistry of the catalysts. These studies focus on the adsorption and desorption of reactants, intermediates, and products on the catalyst surface, providing insights into the reaction mechanisms and the role of surface structures in catalysis.

Key research methods in these studies include temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), which is used to analyze the desorption behavior of adsorbed molecules; Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), which offers information about the surface composition and structure; and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), which provides insights into the molecular interactions on the catalyst surface. Characterization techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are also employed to assess the catalyst properties and surface morphology.

Typical reaction conditions in these studies include the type of catalyst (supported platinum, palladium, etc.), the nature of the reactants (hydrocarbons, ammonia, etc.), the presence of promoters or modifiers (like tin, aluminum, etc.), and the operating parameters (temperature, pressure, gas flow rates, etc.). These conditions are carefully optimized to achieve the desired selectivity and efficiency in the dehydrogenation reactions.

By combining reactor studies and UHV studies, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the selective dehydrogenation process. This knowledge is instrumental in the development and optimization of catalytic processes for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. It allows for the design of more efficient catalysts, the prediction of reaction outcomes, and the minimization of unwanted side reactions, ultimately leading to enhanced performance and sustainability in these industries.
