Selective dehydrogenation reactions are fundamental in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Reactor studies and ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies are pivotal in elucidating these processes, especially in the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methodologies include temperature programmed reduction (TPR), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Characterization techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nitrogen physisorption are employed to evaluate the structural and property aspects of the catalysts. Reaction conditions are manipulated by varying temperatures, pressures, and gas compositions to enhance the dehydrogenation efficiency. These studies provide insights into reaction mechanisms, identify active sites on the catalyst, and elucidate the impact of parameters on reaction performance, guiding the optimization of catalytic processes in this field.
