[1] "The H2 reduction behaviors of bimetallic Pt Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts are related to tin content and preparation techniques, in the samples with 0.3 wt.% Sn, when the solgel and impregnation techniques were applied, there are two hydrogen consumption peaks, respectively, centered at about 100 and 330 C,corresponding to the reduction steps of PtO2 and SnO2 to PtOx and SnOx (1 < x < 2) and then to Pt0 and Sn0. In the samples with 0.6 wt.% Sn, besides the plat- inum and tin phases present, a new kind of tin species were produced, which strongly interacted with the support in the presence of platinum, it could only be reduced up to 500 C. This kind of platinum-modified tin crystals are responsible for the improvement of the catalytic activity of tin-rich samples."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions, the study shows that tin content significantly influences the catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts. With 0.3 wt.% tin, two hydrogen consumption peaks occur at around 100 and 330 C, corresponding to the reduction of PtO2 to Pt0 and SnO2 to Sn0. At 0.6 wt.% tin, a novel platinum-modified tin crystal is formed, which interacts strongly with the support and can only be reduced up to 500 C. This crystal enhances the catalytic activity of the tin-rich catalysts.

在选择性脱氢反应中，研究显示锡含量显著影响双金属PtSn/MgAl2O4催化剂的行为。在0.3 wt.%的锡情况下，两个氢消耗峰分别位于约100和330 C，对应于PtO2转化为Pt0和SnO2转化为Sn0的过程。对于0.6 wt.%的锡，一种新的铂修饰锡晶体形成，它与支持物强烈相互作用，并且只能在500 C以下被还原。这种晶体提高了高锡含量催化剂的催化活性。

[1] "Tin content showed very important effects on the catalyst acidity. Increasing tin content results in a remarkable reduction of acidity of all the catalysts pre- pared by different methods, this is a strong indication that some of tin species in the tin-rich samples poison the acid sites on the support by tin interaction with these acid centers."

Regarding the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions, the document indicates that tin content has significant impacts on catalyst acidity. An increase in tin content leads to a notable decrease in the acidity of catalysts prepared using various methods. This suggests that certain tin species in high-tin catalysts poison the acidic sites on the support through interactions with these acidic centers.
