The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is profound. These reactions enable the conversion of hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds into valuable products. Reactor studies and UHV studies have provided insights into the mechanisms and kinetics of dehydrogenation processes, particularly for C-H and N-H bonds on supported catalysts. Key research methods involve utilizing model catalyst systems, conducting kinetic analysis, and characterizing catalysts through X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Understanding the optimal reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the use of co-catalysts, is critical for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of these catalytic processes.
