<p>The serine protease thrombin, a key protein in the coagulation pathway, can activate cellular signalling directly via proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain of a family of G protein-coupled receptors or indirectly through the generation of molecules such as activated protein C.</p>
<p>These events transmit signals to many cell types and can elicit the production of various pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, thereby influencing cell activation, differentiation, survival and migration.</p>
<p>Thrombin has also been shown to be involved in other experimental models of disease including glomerulonephritis [22] and lung fibrosis [23].</p>
<p>In the lung, thrombin mediates expression of mucin, which is sign of airway inflammation and consists of plasma-derived proteins, mucin glycoproteins and cellular debris, and stimulates expression of tissue factor from nasal epithelial cells through PAR-1 activation.</p>
<p>Thrombin has been shown to upregulate the expression of cytokines, chemokines and other proteins by different cell types. From human adipocytes, thrombin stimulates secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor [25].</p>
<p>From urothelial cells, thrombin induces increased release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which can mediate bladder inflammation [26].</p>
<p>Thrombin has also been shown to induce expression of IL-6 and CXCL8 from human aortic smooth muscle cells, involving AΚt, PKC, mitogen-activated protein kinase and NADPH oxidase signalling [31].</p>
<p>At low concentrations, thrombin has anti-inflammatory effects. Incubation of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells with thrombin at concentrations of 5075 pM reduced or inhibited LPS-induced permeability changes, neutrophil adhesion and transendothelial migration and expression of cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) and E-selectin.</p>
<p>The effects were abrogated by a blocking anti-PAR-1 antibody and were suppressed by LY-294002, a specific cell-permeable phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (PI3 kinase), suggesting a role for PAR-1 activation and PI3 kinase pathway in these anti-inflammatory responses in endothelial cells [34, 35].</p>
<p>All these evidence suggest that targeting coagulation proteases might have therapeutic benefit in inflammatory diseases.</p>

The document discusses the roles of thrombin and protease-activated receptors (PARs) in inflammation. Thrombin can activate cellular signaling through proteolytic cleavage of G protein-coupled receptors or by generating molecules like activated protein C, which influence cell functions such as activation, differentiation, survival, and migration. It is involved in various diseases, including glomerulonephritis and lung fibrosis, where it mediates expression of inflammatory mediators. Thrombin can induce the production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. At low concentrations, it exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by reducing permeability changes, neutrophil adhesion, and cell adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells. This suggests that targeting coagulation proteases could have therapeutic benefits in inflammatory diseases.

文献讨论了凝血途径关键蛋白凝血酶在炎症中的作用。凝血酶可以通过蛋白水解裂解G蛋白偶联受体的N端域或通过生成激活蛋白C等分子来激活细胞信号，影响细胞的功能，如激活、分化、存活和迁移。它参与多种疾病，包括肾小球肾炎和肺纤维化，在这些疾病中，它通过调节粘液表达来介导炎症介质的产生。凝血酶可以诱导细胞因子、趋化因子和生长因子的产生。在低浓度下，它显示出抗炎作用，通过减少内皮细胞的通透性变化、中性粒细胞黏附和细胞黏附分子的表达来抑制炎症反应。这表明靶向凝血酶可能对治疗炎症性疾病有益。
