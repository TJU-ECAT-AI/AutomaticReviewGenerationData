<p>Thrombin, one of the key pathway proteins in the coagulation cascade, is a serine protease that initiates the physiological formation of fibrin clots and platelet activation but has also been implicated in tumour growth, apoptosis, metastasis, pathological tissue remodelling and severe inflammation [16].</p>
<p>It is generated by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated factor X (FXa).</p>
<p>Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, activates other factors in the coagulation pathway (FV, FVIII, FXIII, protein C and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) and can cleave proteins outside the coagulation pathway, such as complement components C3 and C5 (see Fig. 1).</p>
<p>However, thrombin can mediate direct effects on cells through activation of a family of G protein-coupled receptors known as protease-activated receptors (PARs) [9, 10], four of which, PAR-14, have been identified to date.</p>
<p>Whereas PAR-1, -3, and -4 are activated by proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal extracellular domains by thrombin [10, 11], PAR-2 is activated by coagulation factors FXa and FVIIa (but not by thrombin) and other proteases such as trypsin, tryptase and proteinase 3 [1215].</p>
<p>A better understanding of the biochemical pathways involved in thrombin-induced inflammation and of the links between these systems may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic proposes.</p>
<p>The model most widely used to study the role of thrombin and other coagulation proteases in inflammation is that of LPS-induced endotoxaemia, where it is clear from small and large animal studies that inhibiting coagulation inhibits inflammation and prevents significant mortality [1620].</p>
<p>In the lung, thrombin mediates expression of mucin, which is sign of airway inflammation and consists of plasma-derived proteins, mucin glycoproteins and cellular debris, and stimulates expression of tissue factor from nasal epithelial cells through PAR-1 activation.</p>
<p>Thrombin has also been shown to be involved in other experimental models of disease including glomerulonephritis [22] and lung fibrosis [23].</p>
<p>There is particular interest in the role that thrombin and other coagulation proteases may play in chronic cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>On endothelial cells, thrombin can initiate the production of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, TGFβ, MCP-1, PDGF, ICAM-1 and P-selectin, mainly through the NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>These responses by EC to thrombin can be altered by infection.</p>
<p>At low concentrations, thrombin has anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p>All these evidence suggest that targeting coagulation proteases might have therapeutic benefit in inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p>PAR-1 is coupled to the S1P receptor S1P1. S1P1 signalling is coupled to Gi (the effector is adenylate cyclase, AC) pathway and AKT and RAC 1 activation, which lead to reduce vascular leakage.</p>
<p>Thrombin also binds to thrombomodulin following which it is capable of cleaving protein C to generate aPC, a moiety which has pleiotropic effects on coagulation, inflammation, endothelial cells and immune cells [4547].</p>
<p>In the context of murine sepsis or LPS endotoxaemia, aPC acts to reduce mortality, as illustrated by the fact that mice with a thrombomodulin mutation (TMPro) that prevents effective aPC generation is highly susceptible to LPS-induced death.</p>
<p>Thrombin signalling through PAR-1 was necessary for DC to traffic out of draining lymph nodes and that this was responsible for systemic dissemination of endotoxaemia and the lethality associated with endotoxaemia/sepsis.</p>
<p>Importance of PAR-1 activation for leukocyte recruitment Besides the amplification role that thrombin/PAR-1 signalling plays in systemic inflammation, our group has been trying to understand whether PAR-1 signalling is required for specific pro-inflammatory functions.</p>
<p>PAR-1 in the nervous system PAR-1 is expressed throughout the central nervous system on distinct neuronal populations and widely by glial cells in both animals and humans and has been implicated in the neuronal injury and inflammation in the peripheral nervous system [5254].</p>
<p>PAR-1 in the gastrointestinal system In mouse caecum, both PAR-1- and PAR-2-activating peptides induced chloride anion (Cl) secretion.</p>
<p>C57BL/6 mice fed with a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD diet) demonstrated steatohepatitis characterized by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis, pro-inflammatory gene expression and lobular inflammation, which was reduced in PAR-1/ mice, suggesting that PAR-1 may contribute to the MCD diet-induced hepatic injury and inflammation [59].</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori infection, which is associated with gastritis, was reduced in PAR-1/ mice and increased in PAR-2/ mice, and also led to the upregulation of PAR-1 expression and downregulation of PAR-2 expression in wild-type primary gastric epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Non-thrombin-dependent activation of PAR-1 Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) can cleave the N-terminal domain of PAR-1 at a site distinct from the thrombin cleavage site.</p>
<p>PAR-4 has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. PAR-4 was found to be overexpressed in ulcerative colitis (UC) colonic biopsies.</p>
<p>Finally, PAR-4 has been implicated in the in vitro activation of HUVECs by mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a protease of the complement lectin pathway; this elicits a Ca2+ response and induces NF-κB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HUVECs.</p>
<p>PAR-2 has been implicated as a pro-inflammatory receptor involved in several diseases including chronic inflammatory arthritis, dermatitis and colitis.</p>
<p>Macrophages from PAR-2-deficient mice make an altered response to LPS, with reduced IL-10 secretion but enhanced CXCL1 secretion, skewing the responses to a pro-inflammatory pattern [73].</p>
<p>As a further illustration of this concept, activation of PAR-2 by either trypsin or a specific agonist peptide was found to profoundly inhibit the phosphorylation and activity of c-jun N-terminal protein kinase induced by TNF-α in human skin epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Another example of the protective effect of PAR-2 activation was demonstrated by the recent finding of two novel PAR-2 activators, αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin.</p>

The literature discusses the roles of thrombin and protease-activated receptors (PARs) in inflammation, with a focus on their interactions and implications for various diseases. Thrombin, a key coagulation pathway protein, can induce inflammation through direct activation of PARs and indirect effects on cells via cleavage of proteins like C3 and C5. PARs, including PAR-1, PAR-3, PAR-4, and PAR-2, are involved in diverse cellular processes such as cytokine production, chemokine release, and leukocyte recruitment. The literature highlights the complexity of thrombin-PAR signaling, noting that thrombin and activated protein C (aPC) can have opposing effects on inflammation, depending on the downstream signaling pathways engaged. The review also discusses the interplay between thrombin/PAR signaling and other receptors, like S1P receptors, in modulating inflammatory responses. The model of LPS-induced endotoxaemia is used to demonstrate the importance of coagulation inhibition in reducing inflammation and mortality. The literature further explores the role of thrombin in diseases like atherosclerosis, arthritis, and gastrointestinal disorders, emphasizing the multifaceted impacts of thrombin and PARs on inflammation. Research methods include animal studies, examination of cytokine profiles, assessment of cell responses, and investigation of the therapeutic potential of targeting coagulation proteases and PARs for inflammatory diseases. Characterization techniques involve genetic manipulation of PAR-deficient mice, use of PAR antagonists, and analysis of signaling pathways. Reaction conditions typically investigated encompass different disease models, infection scenarios, and inflammatory contexts to understand the dynamic roles of thrombin and PARs in inflammation.
