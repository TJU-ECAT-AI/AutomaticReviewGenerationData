The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage lies in their ability to convert hydrocarbons or ammonia into valuable products such as alkanes and ammonia, respectively. These reactions are crucial for the efficient conversion of raw materials into fuels and chemicals. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute to our understanding of these processes by elucidating the reaction mechanisms, identifying optimal conditions, and characterizing the behavior of catalysts under various operating conditions.

In reactor studies, researchers typically investigate the effect of temperature, pressure, catalyst type, and composition on the dehydrogenation rates and product yields. These studies help in the optimization of the catalytic processes by identifying the most efficient conditions for the desired reactions. UHV studies, on the other hand, provide insights into the atomic-scale interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces, allowing for a deeper understanding of the reaction pathways and the role of surface chemistry in the dehydrogenation process.

The focus on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts is particularly important as these reactions are central to the production of petrochemicals and ammonia, respectively. By studying the dehydrogenation reactions over supported catalysts, researchers aim to develop more efficient and selective catalysts that can enhance the yields of desired products while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impacts.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中的意义在于它们能够将烃类或氨转化为有价值的产物，如烷烃和氨。这些反应对于有效转换原材料为燃料和化学品至关重要。反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究通过阐明反应机制、确定最优条件以及在不同操作条件下表征催化剂行为，对这些过程的理解做出了贡献。

在反应器研究中，研究人员通常探究温度、压力、催化剂类型和组成对脱氢速率和产品产率的影响。这些研究有助于优化催化过程，通过识别实现所需反应所需的最高效条件。相比之下，UHV研究提供了原子尺度上反应物与催化剂表面之间相互作用的见解，允许更深入地理解反应途径及其表面化学在脱氢过程中所扮演的角色。

重点研究C-H和N-H键的脱氢反应，特别是基于支持的催化剂，对于生产石油化学品和氨特别重要。通过研究基于支持的催化剂的脱氢反应，研究者旨在开发更高效、选择性的催化剂，以增强所需产品的产率，同时减少能耗和环境影响。
