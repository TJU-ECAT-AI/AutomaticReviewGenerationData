[1] "Catalytic autothermal reforming of synthetic diesel and JP8 fuel was investigated for fuel cell hydrogen."
[2] "Experimen- tal results revealed that the impregnation of Ni or Pd (in ad- dition to Pt) on alumina or ceria not only improves the ac- tivity but also modifies the catalyst to resist poisoning from sulfur present in the feed."
[3] "Characterization of these formu- lations showed that the enhanced stability is due to a strong metalmetal and metalsupport interaction in the catalyst."
[4] "The improved performance of the bimetallic catalysts is due to structural and electronic effects rather than the degree of metal dispersion."

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions lies in their pivotal role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the conversion of hydrocarbons into lighter molecules, which can be used for various purposes such as producing hydrogen for fuel cells. The studies conducted using reactor and UHV techniques offer profound insights into the mechanisms of these reactions, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. 

Reactor studies involve the use of fixed-bed reactors where hydrocarbon feedstocks are processed at specific conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity, to understand the reaction kinetics and product distribution. This helps in optimizing the catalytic process for maximum efficiency. 

UHV studies, on the other hand, employ ultra-high vacuum environments to examine the surface properties and interactions of catalysts at the atomic level. Techniques like XPS and TPD are crucial in this context, providing information on the dispersion of metals, the nature of surface defects, and the strength of bonds, which are essential for enhancing catalyst performance. 

The key findings from these studies indicate that the enhanced activity and stability of bimetallic catalysts are due to structural and electronic effects rather than mere dispersion. This means that the presence of a second metal, often through a strong metal-metal or metal-support interaction, can significantly improve the catalytic activity, particularly in the presence of sulfur, which can poison catalysts. This understanding not only aids in the development of more robust catalysts but also guides the optimization of existing catalytic processes in terms of reaction conditions and catalyst design.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储领域具有重要意义。它们能够将烃类转化为较轻的分子，这些分子可以用于生产用于燃料电池的氢气。进行的反应器和UHV技术研究提供了关于这些反应机制的深刻见解，特别是关注于在支撑催化剂上进行的C-H和N-H键脱氢。

反应器研究采用固定床反应器，其中通过特定条件（如温度、压力和气体小时空间速度）处理烃类前体物，以理解反应动力学和产品分布情况。这有助于优化催化过程，实现最大效率。

UHV研究则利用超高真空环境来在原子水平上研究催化剂的表面性质和相互作用。例如，XPS和TPD等技术对于这一领域的研究至关重要，它们提供了有关金属分散、表面缺陷性质以及键强度的信息，这些都是提高催化剂性能的关键因素。

研究结果表明，双金属催化剂性能的提升主要归因于结构和电子效应，而非仅仅依靠金属分散度。这意味着第二金属的存在，尤其是通过强金属-金属或金属-支撑相互作用，能够显著改善催化活性，特别是在硫的存在下，硫可以毒害催化剂。这一理解不仅有助于开发更耐用的催化剂，也指导了现有催化过程的优化，包括反应条件和催化剂设计。
