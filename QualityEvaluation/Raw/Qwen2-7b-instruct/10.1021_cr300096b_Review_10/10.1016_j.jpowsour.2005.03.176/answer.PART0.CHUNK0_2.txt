<p>For transportation applications, the primary focus is on reforming gasoline because the production and distribution infrastructure already exists [4,5]. For auxiliary power units, the focus is on reforming both gasoline (for automotive applications [6]) and diesel (for trucks and heavy-duty vehicles [7]). For portable power generation, the focus has been on reforming natural gas and liquified petroleum gas.</p>
<p>The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR). ATR involves the reaction of oxygen, steam and fuel to produce H2 and CO2. In essence, this process can be viewed as a combination of POX and SR and provides higher energy efficiency than the above processes [8].</p>
<p>Catalyst formulations for ATR fuel processors depend on the fuel choice and operating temperature. For methanol, Cu-based formulations can be used [9]. The catalysts based on the noble metals seem to be more active for the ATR reaction than the Ni-based ones [10,11]. Kikuchi et al. [12] studied the methane steam reforming reaction and they have demonstrated that the reactivity of different supported metals on SiO2 follows this relative order: Ru, Rh > Ni > Ir > Pd, Pt > Co, Fe.</p>
<p>A method for developing a noble metal catalyst of improved resistance to sulfur compounds has been claimed [13]. The catalytic composition is obtained by subjecting the catalyst containing a noble metal from group VIII or a compound thereof, a halogen and a carrier.</p>
<p>Current interest in bimetallic catalysts is increasing, in particular because they show superior selectivity and resistance to poisoning as well as improved activity and stability. The main objective of the present work was to determine whether the autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be improved when a second metal is added to the substrate.</p>
<p>The role of defect chemistry and the surface oxygen vacancies in determining the catalytic behavior of supported metal oxide systems is well known. The focus of this study was on the autothermal reforming activity of these catalysts as well as the effect and role of both the metal and the dopant on the catalytic properties.</p>
<p>The TPR profile of the Pd catalyst shows a negative peak at 75 C followed by a positive peak at 110 C. The former can be assigned to desorption of hydrogen from the decomposition of a bulk palladium hydride formed through H-diffusion in to the Pd-crystallites [17], while the latter is attributed to the Pd oxide species. In contrast, the TPR profile of the Pt catalyst shows a broad reduction profile extending from 50 to 450 C.</p>
<p>Significant differences were also observed in the XPS spectra of the Pt and/or Pd catalysts supported on alumina. A slight shift in the Pd 3d5/2 peak (0.5 eV to higher binding energy) of the Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst with respect to that of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was observed (not shown).</p>
<p>The higher level of activities observed over the bimetallic catalysts was further studied by introducing sulfur-containing feeds in to the ATR feed stream. This was achieved by testing the activity of these catalysts for reforming JP8 fuel.</p>
<p>In comparison with the ceria-supported Ni catalyst, the peak indicative of Ni 3s (Ni) species in the bimetallic Pt-Ni catalyst is shifted towards a lower binding energy, indicating a higher electron density in the Ni species in the bimetallic catalyst.</p>
<p>For the bimetallic Pd-Pt catalyst, a decrease in the Pd 3d5/2 signal in addition to a positive binding energy shift to 336.5 eV was found. The positive shift possibly arises from changes in the electronic energy levels of Pd (2 2 0) in the presence of a second metal [16].</p>
