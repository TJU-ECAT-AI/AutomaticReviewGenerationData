<p>The reforming of higher hydrocarbons (e.g. gasoline or diesel) for fuel cell hydrogen is a challenging proposition not only because of sulfur problems but also because coking problems can be severe [1].</p>
<p>For transportation applications, the primary focus is on reforming gasoline because the production and distribution infrastructure already exists [4,5].</p>
<p>The conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to H2 can be carried out by several catalytic reaction processes, including steam reforming (SR), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR).</p>
<p>A method for developing a noble metal catalyst of improved resistance to sulfur compounds has been claimed [13].</p>
<p>The catalytic composition is obtained by subjecting the catalyst containing a noble metal from group VIII or a compound thereof, a halogen and a carrier.</p>
<p>Catalyst formulations for ATR fuel processors depend on the fuel choice and operating temperature. For methanol, Cu-based formulations can be used [9].</p>
<p>The autothermal reforming activity of Pt can be improved when a second metal is added to the substrate.</p>
<p>Before carrying out the activity tests, all the catalysts were reduced at 350 C in a 5% H2/N2 mixture.</p>
<p>TPR profile of the Pt catalyst shows a broad reduction profile extending from 50 to 450 C.</p>
<p>Significant differences were also observed in the XPS spectra of the Pt and/or Pd catalysts supported on alumina.</p>
<p>The higher level of activities observed over the bimetallic catalysts was further studied by introducing sulfur-containing feeds into the ATR feed stream.</p>
<p>TPR data shows no lowering in the NiO reduction temperature after Pt incorporation onto Ni catalysts suggesting no PtNi alloy formation.</p>
<p>In comparison with the ceria-supported Ni catalyst, the peak indicative of Ni 3s (Ni) species in the bimetallic Pt-Ni catalyst is shifted towards a lower binding energy, indicating a higher electron density in the Ni species in the bimetallic catalyst.</p>
<p>For the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst, a decrease in the Pd 3d5/2 signal in addition to a positive binding energy shift to 336.5 eV was found.</p>

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, we find that the literature primarily discusses catalytic autothermal reforming of synthetic diesel and JP8 fuel for fuel cell hydrogen production. The key factors contributing to enhanced stability and performance of bimetallic catalysts include strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions. These interactions likely reduce the tendency of metals to chemisorb sulfur or form bulk sulfide, which can otherwise cause poisoning or deactivation of the catalyst. The literature highlights the use of advanced characterization techniques like TPR, XPS, and H2-TPD to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the improved catalytic activity and stability of bimetallic catalysts. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the optimal conditions, such as metal loadings, support materials, and reaction conditions, that maximize the activity and resistance to sulfur poisoning.

Reactor studies, such as those conducted under controlled conditions of H2O/O2/C ratios, reactor temperatures, and gas hourly space velocities, are crucial for evaluating the performance of catalysts in real-world applications. These studies often involve testing the catalysts with sulfur-containing fuels, like JP8, to assess their resistance to sulfur poisoning. The use of UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) techniques like TPD (Temperature-Programmed Desorption) and TPR (Temperature-Programmed Reduction) helps in understanding the surface chemistry and electronic structure of the catalysts, which in turn aids in the development of more efficient and robust catalysts.

Characterization techniques like BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area measurements, CO chemisorption, and XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) provide insights into the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts, such as surface area, dispersion, and electronic structure. These parameters are critical for understanding how the catalysts interact with the reactants and products, and how these interactions influence the catalytic activity and selectivity.

In summary, the combination of reactor studies and advanced characterization techniques offers a comprehensive approach to optimizing catalytic processes for the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuels. By identifying the key factors that enhance the catalytic activity and stability, researchers can develop more efficient catalysts capable of withstanding harsh operating conditions and producing high-quality hydrogen for fuel cell applications.
