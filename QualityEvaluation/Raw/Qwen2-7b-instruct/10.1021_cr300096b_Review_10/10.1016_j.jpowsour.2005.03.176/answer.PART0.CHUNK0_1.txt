[1] "Catalytic autothermal reforming of synthetic diesel and JP8 fuel was investigated for fuel cell hydrogen."
[2] "Experimen- tal results revealed that the impregnation of Ni or Pd (in addition to Pt) on alumina or ceria not only improves the ac- tivity but also modifies the catalyst to resist poisoning from sulfur present in the feed."
[3] "Characterization of these formu- lations showed that the enhanced stability is due to a strong metalmetal and metalsupport interaction in the catalyst."
[4] "The improved performance of the bimetallic catalysts is due to structural and electronic effects rather than the degree of metal dispersion."

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions, reactor studies and UHV studies are crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic processes in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These studies often focus on examining C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methods involve employing various characterization techniques, such as BET (surface area) and CO chemisorption, TPD (temperature-programmed desorption), TPR (temperature-programmed reduction), and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Reaction conditions typically include controlling the H2O/C, O2/C ratios, pre-heater/reactor temperatures, and gas hourly space velocities. These methodologies provide insights into catalyst properties, such as surface area, dispersion, and stability, which are essential for enhancing catalytic activity and resistance against sulfur poisoning. The synergy between metals in bimetallic catalysts, characterized by strong metal-metal and metal-support interactions, contributes significantly to their superior performance and sulfur tolerance.
