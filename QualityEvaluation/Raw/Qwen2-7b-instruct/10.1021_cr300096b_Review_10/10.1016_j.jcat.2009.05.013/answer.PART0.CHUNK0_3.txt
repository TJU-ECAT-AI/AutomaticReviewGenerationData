<p>The selective hydrogenation of carbonyl groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes is a challenging step leading to the formation of unsaturated alcohols that are important intermediates for various industrial applications.</p>
<p>The hydrogenation of 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal (i.e., citral) is frequently used as a test reaction due to the presence of conjugated CO and CC bonds and an isolated CC bond in this molecule. The hydrogenation of these bonds leads to a variety of different products (Fig. 9).</p>
<p>Although the hydrogenation of isolated and conjugated CC bonds is thermodynamically favored over a hydrogenation of the CO bond, it is desirable to enhance the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group to form nerol and geraniol, which are the most valuable products for the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.</p>
<p>For example, the addition of Fe to Pt/SiO2 at a Pt/Fe ratio of 4/1 was found to increase the activity of Pt for the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde.</p>
<p>Similarly, 4.7% Pt0.3% Fe/C and 4.7% Pt0.3% Fe/TiO2 catalysts were more active than the corresponding monometallic Pt/C and Pt/TiO2 samples for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde.</p>
<p>Finally, in a similar report, bimetallic PtFe/SiO2 catalysts with a variable content of Pt were found to be more active than monometallic Pt/SiO2 for the hydrogenation of citral at 90 C.</p>

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a pivotal role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the conversion of complex molecules into simpler, more valuable compounds. In this context, researchers often focus on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. 

The study of these reactions involves a range of methods and techniques. Reactor studies, for instance, simulate real-world conditions to assess the efficiency and selectivity of catalysts. UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies, on the other hand, offer a controlled environment to investigate the detailed mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions, providing insights into the interactions between the catalysts and the reactants at the atomic level.

These studies typically involve the examination of key reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of specific reactants. Characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), are employed to understand the structure and reactivity of the catalysts. These methods help researchers optimize the catalytic processes by identifying the most effective conditions and catalyst compositions.

In summary, selective dehydrogenation reactions are critical for various industrial applications, and the studies conducted on them contribute significantly to the development of efficient and selective catalytic processes. The combination of reactor and UHV studies, along with advanced characterization techniques, provides a comprehensive understanding of these reactions, facilitating the optimization of catalytic systems for practical use.
