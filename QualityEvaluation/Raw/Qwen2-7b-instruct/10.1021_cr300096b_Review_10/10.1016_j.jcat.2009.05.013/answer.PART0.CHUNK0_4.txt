<p>The effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts: Structure, chemisorptive, and catalytic properties Abstract SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts with a wide range of Pt/Fe ratios were prepared from individual H2PtCl6 and Fe(NO3)3 precursors and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies.</p>
<p>Treatment with H2 at 350 C leads to the formation of metal particles with average sizes in the order of 2.6 nm, some of which are bimetallic in nature. The fraction of PtFe bimetallic contributions in each sample, the nature and extent of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, and the strength of the CO adsorption on Pt strongly depend on the Fe content.</p>
<p>PtFe/SiO2 samples thus prepared were found to be active catalysts for various reactions taking place in both oxidative and reducing environments, including the oxidation of CO in air, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral.</p>

The study investigates the impact of iron (Fe) on the properties of supported platinum (Pt) catalysts. These catalysts, composed of PtFe with varying Pt/Fe ratios, were synthesized using H2PtCl6 and Fe(NO3)3 precursors and characterized using advanced techniques like HRTEM, FTIR, and EXAFS. The size of the metal particles, the proportion of bimetallic structures, and the electronic interactions between Pt and Fe are influenced by the Fe content. These catalysts demonstrate activity in diverse reactions, such as the oxidation of CO in air, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral.

<p>In contrast, when a [Fe3Pt3(CO)15]2 carbonyl cluster was used as the precursor for the preparation of SiO2-supported and NaY(or NaX)-entrapped PtFe samples, the presence of PtFe3+ pair sites located at the interface between Pt ensembles and the support was demonstrated by EXAFS [13] ,[14] . Similarly, we have shown by EXAFS that a Pt5Fe2(COD)2(CO)12 cluster can be deposited nearly intact on a SiO2 surface and decarbonylated in H2 to yield PtFe bimetallic nanoparticles, which incorporate several Pt5Fe2 cluster units and have an average size below 1 nm [15] .</p>

In contrast, when a [Fe3Pt3(CO)15]2 carbonyl cluster was employed as the precursor for synthesizing SiO2-supported and NaY(or NaX)-encapsulated PtFe samples, EXAFS revealed the existence of PtFe3+ pairs situated at the interface between Pt aggregates and the support [13], [14]. Likewise, we demonstrated with EXAFS that a Pt5Fe2(COD)2(CO)12 cluster could be nearly completely deposited onto a SiO2 surface and subsequently decarbonylated in hydrogen to produce PtFe bimetallic nanoparticles, featuring multiple Pt5Fe2 cluster components and an average size below 1 nanometer [15].
