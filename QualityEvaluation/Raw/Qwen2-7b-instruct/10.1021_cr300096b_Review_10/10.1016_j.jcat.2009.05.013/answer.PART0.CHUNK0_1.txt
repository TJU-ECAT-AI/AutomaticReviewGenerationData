<p>The effect of Fe on SiO2-supported Pt catalysts: Structure, chemisorptive, and catalytic properties Abstract SiO2-supported PtFe catalysts with a wide range of Pt/Fe ratios were prepared from individual H2PtCl6 and Fe(NO3)3 precursors and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies.</p>
<p>Treatment with H2 at 350 C leads to the formation of metal particles with average sizes in the order of 2.6 nm, some of which are bimetallic in nature.</p>
<p>The fraction of PtFe bimetallic contributions in each sample, the nature and extent of electronic interactions between Pt and Fe, and the strength of the CO adsorption on Pt strongly depend on the Fe content.</p>
<p>PtFe/SiO2 samples thus prepared were found to be active catalysts for various reactions taking place in both oxidative and reducing environments, including the oxidation of CO in air, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral.</p>

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage lies in their ability to convert complex hydrocarbons and other organic compounds into simpler, more valuable products. In chemical production, dehydrogenation reactions can be used to create a range of useful chemicals from hydrocarbons. In fuel synthesis, they are crucial for converting heavy oils and other feedstocks into lighter, more easily combustible fuels. In hydrogen storage, dehydrogenation is a key step in the extraction of hydrogen from stored materials.

Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies play critical roles in understanding these processes. Reactor studies focus on the practical aspects of the reaction, such as the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feedstock composition), catalyst type and loading, and the product yields and selectivities. They help in optimizing the process conditions for maximum efficiency and productivity.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer insights into the molecular-level mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions. Techniques like FTIR, XAS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), and EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) are used to characterize the structure of catalysts, the nature of surface species, and the adsorption behavior of reactants and products. These studies reveal how the electronic properties of the catalyst surface influence the reaction pathways, including the dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds.

Both types of studies complement each other, with reactor studies providing operational guidelines and UHV studies offering fundamental insights. Together, they enable the development of more efficient and selective dehydrogenation catalysts, which are crucial for advancements in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage technologies.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域中的重要性在于它们能够将复杂的碳氢化合物和其他有机物转化为更简单、更有价值的产品。在化学生产中，脱氢反应可以用来从碳氢化合物中制造一系列有用的化学品。在燃料合成中，它们对于将重油等原料转化为更易于燃烧的轻质燃料至关重要。在氢储存中，脱氢是提取存储材料中氢气的关键步骤。

反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究在理解这些过程方面起着关键作用。反应器研究侧重于反应的实际方面，如反应条件（温度、压力、原料组成）、催化剂类型和装载量以及产品产率和选择性。它们有助于优化工艺条件以实现最大效率和生产力。

UHV研究提供了分子水平上脱氢反应机制的理解。使用如傅里叶变换红外光谱法、XAS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）和EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）等技术来表征催化剂结构、表面物种的性质以及反应物和产物的吸附行为。这些研究揭示了催化剂表面的电子性质如何影响反应途径，包括C-H和N-H键的脱氢。

两种类型的研究相辅相成，反应器研究提供操作指南，而UHV研究提供基本见解。两者结合在一起，使开发更高效、选择性更强的脱氢催化剂成为可能，这对于化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存技术的发展至关重要。
