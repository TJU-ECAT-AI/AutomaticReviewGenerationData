[1] "The reaction pathway of cyclohexene on the monolayer Ni surface is drastically different from Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) film in several aspects: (1) Both HREELS (Figure 6) and NEXAFS (Figure 8) results reveal that cyclohexene is weakly π-bonded to the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface at temperatures up to 200 K. (2) TPD measurements (Figures 1 and 2) detect several gas-phase products at low temperatures, cyclohexane at 245 K, H2 at 259 K, and the desorption of benzene at an onset temperature of 261 K. (3) The product selectivity (Tables 3 and 4) is approximately 9% for cyclohexane and 89% for gas-phase benzene, with only a negligible amount (2%) of adsorbed cyclohexane undergoing complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen. (4) The overall surface activity (Tables 3 and 4), as compared in the common unit of number of cyclohexene molecules undergoing reactions on a per metal atom basis, is lower on monolayer Ni (0.097 per Pt atom) than on the thick Ni(111) film (0.112 per Ni atom)."

The selective dehydrogenation reactions on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface are significant in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The unique chemistry at this surface allows for the selective production of benzene and cyclohexane, with minimal complete decomposition of cyclohexene. This selective behavior is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in fuel synthesis and hydrogen storage, as it enhances efficiency and reduces waste. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to understanding these processes by providing insights into the molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms occurring at the catalyst surface. Key research methods include temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss (HREELS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. These methods allow for the determination of reaction pathways, product selectivities, and the nature of adsorbate interactions. The reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of hydrogen or deuterium, are also critical in influencing the dehydrogenation outcomes. By optimizing these parameters, researchers can enhance the performance of catalysts in industrial applications, leading to more efficient chemical production and cleaner energy solutions.

Analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.

Reactor studies involve the examination of reaction kinetics, product yields, and selectivities under industrial conditions. These studies often employ batch or continuous flow reactors, allowing researchers to investigate the behavior of catalysts and reactants in a controlled environment. Characterization techniques such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectroscopy are used to monitor product composition, reaction progress, and catalyst performance. Key reaction conditions typically investigated include temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition.

UHV studies, on the other hand, offer a more detailed understanding of the atomic-scale interactions occurring at the catalyst surface. Techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) provide insights into the adsorption and reaction mechanisms. These studies enable researchers to identify specific surface intermediates, bonding configurations, and kinetic pathways that govern the catalytic activity.

The combination of reactor and UHV studies provides a comprehensive view of catalytic processes. Reactor studies inform on practical performance and efficiency, while UHV studies elucidate the underlying mechanisms at the atomic level. This synergy facilitates the development of more effective catalysts, optimized reaction conditions, and improved industrial processes in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

<p>It is well known from the surface science and catalysis literature that the chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces are often different from those of either of the parent metals. 1-8 For example, Goodman has observed that the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, with Ni coverages in the monolayer regime, showed higher hydrogenolysis activity than that on either Ni or Pt.5 Additionally, Xu and Koel have shown that by adding Sn to Pt(111) surfaces, the resulting (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) surface suppressed the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene on Pt(111).4 Another related system, Bi and Pt(111), has also been investigated by Rodriguez and Campbell. They found that by adding Bi, the reactive sites on Pt(111) are titrated since the inert Bi adatoms act as site-blockers for the dehydrogenation reaction.6 Previously, we have performed a temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) investigation of the chemical reaction of D2 on the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.1 Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111). Using D2 as a probe molecule, we compared the relative binding energies of atomic deuterium by following its recombinative desorption from Pt(111), thick Ni/Pt(111), and a Ni/Pt(111) surface with a monolayer Ni coverage.1 The main desorption peak of D2 from the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface was at 220 K, which was about 74 K lower than that on Pt(111) and about 154 K lower than that on the thick Ni(111) film. Such a significant reduction in the desorption temperature indicated that the strength of the metalD bond was much weaker on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).</p>

<p>Catalyst studies on selective dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions involve the breaking of hydrogen bonds, typically C-H or N-H bonds, to generate valuable products such as alkanes, alkenes, or ammonia. The selectivity and efficiency of these reactions are influenced by factors such as catalyst type, temperature, pressure, and the nature of the reactants. Reactor studies, employing equipment like fixed-bed reactors or fluidized bed reactors, simulate industrial conditions and help in understanding the kinetics, mechanisms, and stability of the reactions. These studies often focus on optimizing the reaction conditions to maximize the desired product yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

UHV studies, on the other hand, provide insights into the surface chemistry and molecular interactions that occur during dehydrogenation. These studies use advanced techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS). They allow researchers to characterize the adsorption and reaction pathways of molecules on catalyst surfaces at the atomic level. This information is invaluable for understanding how the surface chemistry affects the reaction outcomes and can guide the design of more efficient catalysts.

In the context of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, UHV studies have revealed that the properties of bimetallic surfaces can exhibit unique chemical behaviors compared to their constituent metals. For instance, the authors of the literature mention the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces, where the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene are significantly altered due to the weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film. This finding underscores the potential of manipulating catalyst properties by controlling the overlayer thickness, which could lead to the development of more selective and efficient catalysts for various industrial applications. The combination of reactor studies and UHV studies provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and optimizing dehydrogenation reactions, thereby advancing the fields of chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.</p>

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, we see that these processes are crucial for converting organic compounds into valuable products. In the context of supported catalysts, the dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds allows for the production of alkenes, alkanes, and ammonia, among other useful compounds. 

Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes. Reactor studies often involve industrial-scale reactors where the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading, are varied to optimize the yield and selectivity of desired products. These studies can reveal insights into the kinetic behavior of reactions and the influence of operational parameters on the efficiency of the catalytic process.

On the other hand, UHV studies, conducted under ultra-high vacuum conditions, offer a more controlled environment for examining the surface chemistry of catalysts. These studies employ advanced spectroscopic techniques like high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). These methods enable researchers to characterize the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of molecules on the catalyst surface, providing a detailed understanding of the reaction pathways and product selectivities.

In particular, UHV studies have shown that the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces, like Ni/Pt(111), can differ significantly from their constituent metals, leading to unique chemical properties. For instance, the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface exhibits distinct behavior in terms of adsorption, reaction pathways, and product yields when compared to clean Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) surfaces. The weaker interaction between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni film is thought to be responsible for these unique chemical properties, which can be exploited to enhance the efficiency of catalytic processes.

Overall, both reactor and UHV studies are essential for advancing our knowledge of selective dehydrogenation reactions and optimizing catalytic processes in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. By understanding the complex interplay between surface chemistry, reaction kinetics, and product selectivity, researchers can develop more efficient catalysts and processes for converting organic compounds into valuable materials.

另一方面，超真空研究在超高真空条件下进行，提供了一个更可控的环境来研究催化剂表面的化学。这些研究使用高级光谱技术，如高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）、近边X射线吸收精细结构光谱（NEXAFS）和温度程序脱附（TPD）。这些方法使研究人员能够表征分子在催化剂表面上的吸附和反应机制，为了解反应途径和产物选择性提供了详细理解。

特别是，超真空研究表明，二元金属表面，如Ni/Pt(111)，与它们的组成金属相比，其活性可能有很大差异，导致独特的化学性质。例如，单层Ni/Pt(111)表面在吸附、反应途径和产物产量方面与清洁的Pt(111)或厚Ni(111)表面表现出不同行为。认为单层Ni薄膜与吸附剂之间较弱的相互作用是造成这些独特化学性质的原因，这可以被用来提高催化过程的效率。

总的来说，反应器研究和超真空研究都是推进我们对选择性脱氢反应知识和优化化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储中的催化过程的理解的关键。通过理解表面化学、反应动力学和产物选择性的复杂相互作用，研究人员可以开发出更高效的催化剂和过程，用于将有机化合物转化为有价值的材料。
