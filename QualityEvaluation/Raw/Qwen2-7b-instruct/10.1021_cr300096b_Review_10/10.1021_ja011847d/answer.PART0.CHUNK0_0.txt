[1] "The reaction pathway of cyclohexene on the monolayer Ni surface is drastically different from Pt(111) or thick Ni(111) film in several aspects: (1) Both HREELS (Figure 6) and NEXAFS (Figure 8) results reveal that cyclohexene is weakly π-bonded to the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface at temperatures up to 200 K. (2) TPD measurements (Figures 1 and 2) detect several gas-phase products at low temperatures, cyclohexane at 245 K, H2 at 259 K, and the desorption of benzene at an onset temperature of 261 K. (3) The product selectivity (Tables 3 and 4) is approximately 9% for cyclohexane and 89% for gas-phase benzene, with only a negligible amount (2%) of adsorbed cyclohexane undergoing complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen. (4) The overall surface activity (Tables 3 and 4), as compared in the common unit of number of cyclohexene molecules undergoing reactions on a per metal atom basis, is lower on monolayer Ni (0.097 per Pt atom) than on the thick Ni(111) film (0.112 per Ni atom)."

The selective dehydrogenation reactions on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface are significant in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The unique chemistry at this surface allows for the selective production of benzene and cyclohexane, with minimal complete decomposition of cyclohexene. This selective behavior is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in fuel synthesis and hydrogen storage, as it enhances efficiency and reduces waste. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to understanding these processes by providing insights into the molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms occurring at the catalyst surface. Key research methods include temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss (HREELS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. These methods allow for the determination of reaction pathways, product selectivities, and the nature of adsorbate interactions. The reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of hydrogen or deuterium, are also critical in influencing the dehydrogenation outcomes. By optimizing these parameters, researchers can enhance the performance of catalysts in industrial applications, leading to more efficient chemical production and cleaner energy solutions.

在单层Ni/Pt（111）表面上的选择性脱氢反应对于化学生产、燃料合成和氢存储具有重要意义。这种独特的化学性质允许选择性地产生苯和环己烷，而几乎不完全分解环己烯。这种选择性行为对于优化燃料合成和氢存储过程至关重要，因为它提高了效率并减少了浪费。反应器研究和超高压研究通过提供有关催化剂表面分子相互作用和反应机制的理解，对这些过程提供了见解。关键的研究方法包括温度程序脱附（TPD）、高分辨率电子能量损失（HREELS）和近边X射线吸收精细结构（NEXAFS）光谱法。这些方法允许确定反应途径、产品选择性和吸附剂相互作用的性质。反应条件，如温度、压力以及氢或重氢的存在，也会影响脱氢结果。通过优化这些参数，研究人员可以提高工业应用中催化剂的性能，从而实现更高效的化学生产和清洁能源解决方案。
