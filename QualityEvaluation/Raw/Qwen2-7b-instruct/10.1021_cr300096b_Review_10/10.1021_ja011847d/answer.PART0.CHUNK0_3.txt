[1] "Our results clearly showed that the reactivity of the bimetallic Ni/Pt surfaces, at near monolayer Ni coverages, is substantially different from that of either Ni(111) or Pt(111)."
[2] "By exposing the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface to D2 prior to the adsorption of cyclohexene, the total yield of the normal and deuterated cyclohexanes increases by approximately 5-fold."
[3] "The product selectivity to gas-phase cyclohexane is approximately 9% on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, and the cyclohexane yield is increased by a factor of 5 by exposing the monolayer Ni to D2 prior to the adsorption of cyclohexene."
[4] "Our results suggest that the unique chemistry is related to the weaker bonding between adsorbates and the monolayer Ni surface."

The selective dehydrogenation reactions play a significant role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. They enable the conversion of complex molecules into simpler ones, often facilitating the production of useful chemicals and fuels. Reactor studies and UHV studies contribute to our understanding of these processes by providing insights into the mechanisms and conditions that govern these reactions over supported catalysts. Key research methods involve observing the reactivity of materials under controlled conditions, while characterization techniques like temperature-programmed desorption, high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy help elucidate the nature of the reactions. Reaction conditions typically investigated include temperature, pressure, and the nature of the catalyst. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by revealing the most effective conditions for specific reactions, thus enhancing efficiency and selectivity in industrial applications.
