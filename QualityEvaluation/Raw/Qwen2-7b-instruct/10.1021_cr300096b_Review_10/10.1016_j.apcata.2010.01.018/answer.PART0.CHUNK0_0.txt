Based on the research conducted, the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces leads to several significant effects on the catalytic properties of Pt. Firstly, it is observed that the binding energies of adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen are much weaker on Au/Pt surfaces compared to pure Pt surfaces. This reduction in binding energy is expected to result in a decreased extent of coke formation and CO poisoning, enhancing the overall stability and activity of the catalyst. Secondly, the formation of the bimetallic surface promotes selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene, reducing the deposition of carbon on the surface and thereby mitigating the coking problem. This demonstrates that the presence of Au on Pt surfaces can potentially inhibit carbon deposition and reduce CO poisoning, offering a promising avenue for improving the performance of Pt catalysts in various chemical processes.

根据研究，Au/Pt双金属表面的形成在铂催化剂的催化性质上产生了显著影响。首先，吸附剂如原子氢和氧在Au/Pt表面上的结合能明显低于纯铂表面，这归因于结合能的显著降低。预计这种结合能的下降将减少焦炭形成和一氧化碳中毒的程度，从而增强催化剂的整体稳定性和活性。其次，双金属表面的形成促进了环己烯的选择性脱氢反应，生成苯，减少了表面碳沉积，并进而减少了结焦问题。这表明铂表面掺杂Au可以潜在地抑制碳沉积并减少一氧化碳中毒，为改善铂催化剂在各种化学过程中的性能提供了有前景的途径。
