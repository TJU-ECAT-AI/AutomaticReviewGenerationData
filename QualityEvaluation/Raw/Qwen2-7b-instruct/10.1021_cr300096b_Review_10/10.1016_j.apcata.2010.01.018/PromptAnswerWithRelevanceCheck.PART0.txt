Based on the research conducted, the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces leads to several significant effects on the catalytic properties of Pt. Firstly, it is observed that the binding energies of adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen are much weaker on Au/Pt surfaces compared to pure Pt surfaces. This reduction in binding energy is expected to result in a decreased extent of coke formation and CO poisoning, enhancing the overall stability and activity of the catalyst. Secondly, the formation of the bimetallic surface promotes selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene, reducing the deposition of carbon on the surface and thereby mitigating the coking problem. This demonstrates that the presence of Au on Pt surfaces can potentially inhibit carbon deposition and reduce CO poisoning, offering a promising avenue for improving the performance of Pt catalysts in various chemical processes.

根据研究，Au/Pt双金属表面的形成在铂催化剂的催化性质上产生了显著影响。首先，吸附剂如原子氢和氧在Au/Pt表面上的结合能明显低于纯铂表面，这归因于结合能的显著降低。预计这种结合能的下降将减少焦炭形成和一氧化碳中毒的程度，从而增强催化剂的整体稳定性和活性。其次，双金属表面的形成促进了环己烯的选择性脱氢反应，生成苯，减少了表面碳沉积，并进而减少了结焦问题。这表明铂表面掺杂Au可以潜在地抑制碳沉积并减少一氧化碳中毒，为改善铂催化剂在各种化学过程中的性能提供了有前景的途径。

[6] "As summarized in Table 1 , cyclohexene undergoes three reaction pathways on Pt surface, in which the total decomposition is the main pathway."
[7] "Different from Pt, the reaction of cyclohexene on Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, in particular the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface, is mainly dehydrogenation; the extent of carbon deposition on 0.5 ML AuPt is also significantly reduced."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a critical role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds into more valuable products. The study of these processes often involves a combination of reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies to understand the catalytic mechanisms and optimize the processes.

Reactor studies typically involve the operation of actual or simulated industrial reactors under specific conditions. Researchers monitor the conversion rates, product yields, and selectivities of various chemical reactions. They often adjust parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of reactants to find optimal operating conditions. These studies help in understanding the kinetics of reactions and identifying the most efficient catalysts.

UHV studies, on the other hand, focus on the surface chemistry and dynamics of reactions occurring at the molecular level. These studies often employ techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) modeling and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. DFT allows for the calculation of electronic structures and energetics of materials, while TPD provides insights into the adsorption and desorption kinetics of molecules on the catalyst surface. This information is crucial for understanding the mechanism of reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the formation of hydrogen storage materials.

Characterization techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and mass spectrometry are frequently used in UHV studies to assess the surface composition and the products of reactions. These techniques enable researchers to quantify the extent of reactions and identify any side products or byproducts. 

The synergy between reactor studies and UHV studies is essential for advancing the field of catalysis. Reactor studies provide practical insights into the performance of catalysts under real-world conditions, while UHV studies offer detailed mechanistic understanding that can guide the development of new catalysts and reaction pathways. Together, they inform the optimization of catalytic processes, leading to more efficient chemical production, cleaner fuels, and improved hydrogen storage technologies.

The paper focuses on enhancing the durability of platinum catalysts by incorporating gold (Au) into a bimetallic structure. This approach aims to mitigate issues such as coking and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, which can deactivate catalysts during various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. The research combines computational modeling (density functional theory, DFT) and experimental techniques (temperature-programmed desorption, TPD) to analyze the impact of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces on the binding energies of adsorbates like hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), as well as the extent of carbon deposition from cyclohexene decomposition. The results suggest that Au/Pt surfaces weaken the adsorption of CO and other molecules, thereby reducing the risk of CO poisoning and coking, which are critical challenges in catalytic and electrocatalytic applications.

The study's findings support the use of Au/Pt bimetallic alloys in catalysts to enhance their performance and stability in reactions involving hydrocarbons and CO. The DFT calculations predict that the binding energies of adsorbates on Pt are significantly reduced upon the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces. The TPD experiments confirm that CO binds more weakly to Au/Pt surfaces, which reduces CO poisoning. Additionally, the Au/Pt bimetallic surface is shown to inhibit the accumulation of atomic carbon from cyclohexene decomposition, suggesting that the Au/Pt alloy can effectively prevent coking.

In conclusion, the Au/Pt bimetallic structure offers a promising solution for improving the resistance of Pt catalysts against deactivation caused by coking and CO poisoning. The research underscores the importance of surface chemistry in optimizing catalysts' performance and stability in various industrial applications, including refining, petrochemical processes, and fuel cell technologies.
