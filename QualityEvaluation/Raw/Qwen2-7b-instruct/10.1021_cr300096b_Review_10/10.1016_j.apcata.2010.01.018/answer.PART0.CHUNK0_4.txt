[1] "The main objective of the current paper is to improve the resistance to deactivation by modifying the Pt surfaces with the presence of submonolayer to monolayer coverages of Au."
[2] "The reduction of coke formation is verified experimentally based on the decomposition of cyclohexene; the weakening of CO adsorption is confirmed based on the desorption temperatures of CO from Pt and AuPt surfaces."
[3] "The extent of total decomposition to produce atomic carbon, which is the initial process for coking of the Pt surfaces, is evaluated by the post-TPD AES, as shown in Fig. 6. An intense carbon peak (275 eV) is detected on the Pt foil, indicating that total decomposition to atomic carbon and hydrogen is a main reaction pathway on the Pt surface. In contrast, the absence of the carbon peak on the 1 ML Au/Pt surface implies that no decomposition reaction occurs on the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, indicating that the bimetallic surface should be much more resistant to coking."

The paper focuses on enhancing the durability of platinum catalysts by incorporating gold (Au) into a bimetallic structure. This approach aims to mitigate issues such as coking and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, which can deactivate catalysts during various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. The research combines computational modeling (density functional theory, DFT) and experimental techniques (temperature-programmed desorption, TPD) to analyze the impact of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces on the binding energies of adsorbates like hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), as well as the extent of carbon deposition from cyclohexene decomposition. The results suggest that Au/Pt surfaces weaken the adsorption of CO and other molecules, thereby reducing the risk of CO poisoning and coking, which are critical challenges in catalytic and electrocatalytic applications.

The study's findings support the use of Au/Pt bimetallic alloys in catalysts to enhance their performance and stability in reactions involving hydrocarbons and CO. The DFT calculations predict that the binding energies of adsorbates on Pt are significantly reduced upon the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces. The TPD experiments confirm that CO binds more weakly to Au/Pt surfaces, which reduces CO poisoning. Additionally, the Au/Pt bimetallic surface is shown to inhibit the accumulation of atomic carbon from cyclohexene decomposition, suggesting that the Au/Pt alloy can effectively prevent coking.

In conclusion, the Au/Pt bimetallic structure offers a promising solution for improving the resistance of Pt catalysts against deactivation caused by coking and CO poisoning. The research underscores the importance of surface chemistry in optimizing catalysts' performance and stability in various industrial applications, including refining, petrochemical processes, and fuel cell technologies.

本文主要目标是通过在铂表面引入金（Au）形成双金属结构，以提高催化剂的耐久性。这一策略旨在解决催化和电催化过程中遇到的焦化和一氧化碳（CO）中毒问题，这些问题会导致催化剂失活。研究结合计算建模（密度泛函理论，DFT）和实验技术（温度程序脱附，TPD），分析了Au/Pt双金属表面对吸附剂如氢（H）和氧（O）的结合能的影响，以及从环己烯分解过程中碳沉积的程度。结果显示，Au/Pt表面减弱了CO和其他分子的吸附，从而减少了CO中毒的风险，并降低了焦化的风险，这是催化和电催化应用中遇到的关键挑战。

研究结果支持在涉及烃类和CO的反应中使用Au/Pt双金属合金作为催化剂，以增强其性能和稳定性。DFT计算预测，Au/Pt双金属表面的吸附剂结合能显著降低。TPD实验证实，CO在Au/Pt表面上的吸附较弱，这减少了CO中毒的风险。此外，Au/Pt双金属表面被证明可以抑制环己烯分解过程中原子碳的积累，表明Au/Pt合金可以有效防止焦化。

综上所述，Au/Pt双金属结构为提高铂催化剂在焦化和CO中毒导致的失活问题上的耐久性提供了有前景的解决方案。研究强调了表面化学在优化催化剂性能和稳定性的关键作用，特别是在炼油、石油化工过程和燃料电池技术等领域中的应用。
