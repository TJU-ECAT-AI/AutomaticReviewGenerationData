The study evaluates whether the formation of an Au/Pt bimetallic surface alloy can enhance the resistance against coking and CO poisoning on Pt catalysts. The research employs a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The DFT results indicate that the binding energies of adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen are significantly weaker on Au/Pt surfaces compared to pure Pt. The TPD analysis confirms that the Au/Pt surface bonds CO more weakly than pure Pt, which suggests that Au/Pt surfaces might help mitigate CO poisoning. Additionally, the study uses cyclohexene as a probe molecule to assess the extent of carbon deposition on the surfaces, demonstrating that the Au/Pt bimetallic alloy inhibits carbon deposition, offering potential resistance against coking. These findings support the use of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces as a means to improve the stability and efficiency of Pt catalysts in various catalytic processes.

当前论文的主要目标是通过在铂表面添加少量到单层的金覆盖层，以改善催化剂的抗失活能力。研究采用了密度泛函理论（DFT）建模和温度程序脱附（TPD）实验相结合的方法。DFT结果表明，吸附剂如原子氢和氧在Au/Pt表面的结合能远弱于纯铂。TPD分析证实了Au/Pt表面与CO的结合力较弱于纯铂，这表明Au/Pt表面可能有助于减少CO中毒。此外，使用环己烯作为探针分子评估表面碳沉积的量，结果显示Au/Pt双金属合金可以抑制碳沉积，提供对抗焦化的可能性。这些发现支持使用Au/Pt双金属表面作为提高铂催化剂稳定性和效率的一种手段。
