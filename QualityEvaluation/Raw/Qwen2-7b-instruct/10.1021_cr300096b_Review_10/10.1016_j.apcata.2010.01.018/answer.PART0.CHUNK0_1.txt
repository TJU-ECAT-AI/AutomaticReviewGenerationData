[1] "In the current work we have evaluated whether the formation of an Au/Pt bimetallic surface alloy would improve the resistance to coking and CO poisoning, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments."
[2] "The CO desorption TPD revealed that the Au/Pt surface bonded CO more weakly than Pt, indicating that modifying Pt with Au could potentially help reduce CO poisoning."
[3] "In addition, the decomposition and dehydrogenation of cyclohexene were used as probe reactions to compare the extent of carbon deposition on the Pt and AuPt surfaces."
[4] "TPD results showed that the presence of Au on Pt promoted the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene."
[5] "The extent of total decomposition to produce atomic carbon, which is the initial process for coking of the Pt surfaces, is evaluated by the post-TPD AES."
[6] "As summarized in Table 1 , cyclohexene undergoes three reaction pathways on Pt surface, in which the total decomposition is the main pathway."
[7] "Different from Pt, the reaction of cyclohexene on Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, in particular the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface, is mainly dehydrogenation; the extent of carbon deposition on 0.5 ML AuPt is also significantly reduced."
[8] "No atomic carbon is detected after the TPD experiments on the 1 ML Au/Pt surfaces."
[9] "Overall, the results in Table 1 indicate that the activity of Pt toward cyclohexene is reduced by the formation of the Au/Pt bimetallic surface, consistent with a weaker binding energy of cyclohexene based on extrapolation from the DFT calculations of H and O binding energies."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a critical role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds into more valuable products. The study of these processes often involves a combination of reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies to understand the catalytic mechanisms and optimize the processes.

Reactor studies typically involve the operation of actual or simulated industrial reactors under specific conditions. Researchers monitor the conversion rates, product yields, and selectivities of various chemical reactions. They often adjust parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the composition of reactants to find optimal operating conditions. These studies help in understanding the kinetics of reactions and identifying the most efficient catalysts.

UHV studies, on the other hand, focus on the surface chemistry and dynamics of reactions occurring at the molecular level. These studies often employ techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) modeling and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. DFT allows for the calculation of electronic structures and energetics of materials, while TPD provides insights into the adsorption and desorption kinetics of molecules on the catalyst surface. This information is crucial for understanding the mechanism of reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and the formation of hydrogen storage materials.

Characterization techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and mass spectrometry are frequently used in UHV studies to assess the surface composition and the products of reactions. These techniques enable researchers to quantify the extent of reactions and identify any side products or byproducts. 

The synergy between reactor studies and UHV studies is essential for advancing the field of catalysis. Reactor studies provide practical insights into the performance of catalysts under real-world conditions, while UHV studies offer detailed mechanistic understanding that can guide the development of new catalysts and reaction pathways. Together, they inform the optimization of catalytic processes, leading to more efficient chemical production, cleaner fuels, and improved hydrogen storage technologies.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存领域中起着至关重要的作用。这些反应能够将烃类和氮化合物转化为更有价值的产品。对这些过程的研究通常结合了反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究，以理解催化机制并优化过程。

反应器研究通常涉及实际或模拟工业反应器的操作，在特定条件下进行。研究人员监测各种化学反应的转化率、产品产率和选择性。他们经常调整参数，如温度、压力和反应物组成，以找到最佳操作条件。这些研究有助于理解反应动力学，并确定最高效的催化剂。

另一方面，UHV研究专注于在分子水平上发生的表面化学和动态。这些研究通常采用密度泛函理论（DFT）建模和温度程序脱附（TPD）实验等技术。DFT允许计算材料的电子结构和能量，而TPD提供了分子在催化剂表面吸附和脱附动力学的信息。这些信息对于理解反应机制至关重要，如烃类的脱氢和氢存储材料的形成。

在UHV研究中，通常使用Auger电子能谱（AES）和质谱等表征技术来评估表面组成和反应产物。这些技术使研究人员能够量化反应的程度，并识别任何副产品或衍生物。

反应器研究与UHV研究之间的协同作用对于推进催化领域至关重要。反应器研究提供了在真实世界条件下催化剂性能的实用见解，而UHV研究提供了深入的机制理解，这可以指导新催化剂和反应途径的发展。它们共同为更高效的化学生产、清洁燃料和改进的氢储存技术提供信息。
