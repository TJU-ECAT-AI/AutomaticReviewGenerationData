[1] "The main objective of the current paper is to improve the resistance to deactivation by modifying the Pt surfaces with the presence of submonolayer to monolayer coverages of Au."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts often show enhanced catalytic selectivity, activity and stability as compared to those of the parent metals."
[3] "In particular, we performed comparative studies to determine how the presence of Au affected the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and CO; we also investigated the extent of carbon deposition from the decomposition of cyclohexene to determine the effect of bimetallic formation towards the potential resistance to coking."
[4] "Based on the results and discussion presented above, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of Au/Pt alloy formation on the surface reactivities of Pt:"

The significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions lies in their critical role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions enable the conversion of complex molecules into simpler, more valuable compounds. Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies are essential in understanding the mechanisms behind these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Key research methods include density functional theory (DFT) modeling, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments, and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Characterization techniques such as mass spectrometry and AES allow for the detection and quantification of products and intermediates. Reaction conditions typically involve specific temperatures, pressures, and catalyst loadings. These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by identifying the most effective conditions and catalyst compositions for desired reactions, leading to increased efficiency and selectivity in industrial applications.
