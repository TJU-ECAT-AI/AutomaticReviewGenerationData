Both articles could benefit from more in-depth analysis, critical thinking, and a stronger emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches. They also share a similar level of writing quality, practical application value, and adherence to academic standards. In summary, while there are no clear distinctions between the two reviews, they both fall short in terms of innovation, critical thinking, and the integration of interdisciplinary perspectives."
