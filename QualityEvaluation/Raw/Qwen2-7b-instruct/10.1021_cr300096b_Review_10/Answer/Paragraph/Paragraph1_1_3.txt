        The significance, applications, and research methodologies of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage have been extensively studied, with a particular emphasis on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. This review highlights the importance of these reactions in catalytic processes, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation, where the use of supported catalysts plays a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and selectivity.

        Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies are pivotal in understanding the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions, offering insights into the optimization of catalytic processes. These studies involve examining the dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds over supported catalysts, employing characterization techniques such as Temperature-Programmed Reduction (TPR) and Adsorption Microcalorimetry to analyze catalyst behavior. Reaction conditions are carefully controlled to optimize catalytic processes, providing insights into enhancing catalyst performance and selectivity.

        UHV studies enable detailed analysis of surface reactions, contributing significantly to catalyst design and improvement. By evaluating the effectiveness of different catalysts and conditions, researchers can tailor processes for specific applications, thereby optimizing the dehydrogenation reactions for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

        The addition of rhenium to a catalyst has been shown to enhance its stability and selectivity, while the structure and role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts remain a subject of ongoing debate. Bimetallic interactions in catalysts, such as those composed of nickel and platinum, are known to exhibit higher hydrogenolysis activity compared to their monometallic counterparts and physical mixtures. These catalysts can undergo several sequential reaction-regeneration cycles, recovering their initial activity levels and maintaining the nature of the catalytic surface without significant modifications.

        In summary, the selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in various industrial applications, including chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The use of supported catalysts, along with advanced characterization techniques and optimized reaction conditions, enables the development of efficient and selective catalytic processes.
