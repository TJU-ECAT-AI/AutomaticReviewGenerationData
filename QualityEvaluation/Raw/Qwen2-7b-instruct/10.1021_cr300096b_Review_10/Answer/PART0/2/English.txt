Higher hydrocarbons, especially aromatics, increase deactivation due to carbon buildup. Sulfur, present in many transportation fuels, acts as a catalyst poison and negatively impacts catalyst stability. Steam reforming for transportation fuels often focuses on synthetic fuels. It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene, contribute to deactivation by causing coke formation. Adding 5 ppm sulfur leads to significant deactivation after 22 hours, making industrial hydrogen production unfeasible. Air treatment can restore catalyst activity, but deactivation occurs faster post-regeneration. A preemptive regeneration process can extend the stable activity period for sulfur-containing fuels. Key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions are typically explored to optimize catalytic processes in this field.

The improvement in catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts can be attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles, which reduces the size of surface platinum ensembles, suppresses undesired reactions, and enhances selectivity and stability. Deactivation in these reactions often occurs due to side reactions, primarily isomerization and cracking, leading to the blocking of active sites through coke deposition. In the case of Pt/C catalysts, carbon deposition causes significant deactivation. The increase in selectivity over time can be explained by geometric considerations. Specifically, in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane, the bimetallic catalyst exhibited much higher activity than the monometallic catalyst, achieving 100% selectivity for the dehydrogenated product, iso-butene.

The catalytic reforming of naphtha typically involves the use of a bifunctional catalyst with both hydrogenating metal and acid functionalities. The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) serves as a metric for evaluating platinum dispersion in catalysts. It is established that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts surpasses that of monometallic counterparts and physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3. Hydrogenolysis being a structure-sensitive reaction, it acts as a diagnostic tool for assessing the formation of PtRe alloys. Prior treatments affect the reactivity of rhenium and the extent of PtRe alloy formation. To optimize the utilization of allocated beam time at the ESRF and Brookhaven laboratories, samples were dried and reduced outside the lab. Volumetric hydrogen chemisorption was measured at 25°C using a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 instrument. All spectra were acquired at room temperature. Our analytical methodology paralleled that adopted by Fung et al.
