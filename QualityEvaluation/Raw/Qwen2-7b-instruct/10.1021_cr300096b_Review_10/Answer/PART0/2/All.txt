Sulfur, present in many transportation fuels, acts as a catalyst poison and negatively impacts catalyst stability. Steam reforming for transportation fuels often focuses on synthetic fuels. It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene, contribute to deactivation by causing coke formation. Adding 5 ppm sulfur leads to significant deactivation after 22 hours, making industrial hydrogen production unfeasible. Air treatment can restore catalyst activity, but deactivation occurs faster post-regeneration. A preemptive regeneration process can extend the stable activity period for sulfur-containing fuels.
