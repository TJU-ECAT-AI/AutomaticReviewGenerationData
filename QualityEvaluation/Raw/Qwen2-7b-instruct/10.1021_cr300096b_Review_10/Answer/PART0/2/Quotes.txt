[1] "The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."
          [2] "Deactivation in this kind of reactions is due to side reactions (mainly isomerization and cracking) which produce blocking of active sites by coke deposition."
          [3] "In the case of Pt/C, deposition of carbon would be responsible of the strong deactivation observed."
          [4] "Also, the increase in selectivity in this sample with time on stream can be explained by the same geometrics arguments."
          [5] "In the case of iso-butane dehydrogenation, the bimetallic catalyst was much more active than the monometallic one, exhibiting a 100% selectivity towards the dehydrogenated product, iso-butene."
