          <p>The current work focuses on studying the reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends.</p>
          <p>There has been extensive research on the reforming of conventional transportation fuels of gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel and additionally there are many published studies on the reforming of pure ethanol, however, literature on ethanol-gasoline blends is limited.</p>
          <p>In this paper deactivation, regeneration and stability of a Rh/Pt catalyst on a zirconia containing carrier is studied for the steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends at an energy efficient condition with steam/fuel ratio's slightly higher than stoichiometric (steam/carbon = 1.8) and with temperatures at or near 650 C.</p>
          <p>The objective of this study is to understand catalyst deactivation in order to develop a process for reforming E85 at less energy intensive conditions. The process of regeneration and preemptive air treatment is studied as a method for maintaining catalyst stability.</p>
          <p>Aging tests were performed with sulfur-free E85 under two sets of experimental conditions where the space velocities and catalyst loadings differed.</p>
          <p>At both the low and high space velocity condition a steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained.</p>
          <p>Under high space velocity conditions the catalyst was not stable reforming E85 with or without sulfur.</p>
          <p>The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration.</p>
          <p>A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel.</p>
          <p>XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments.</p>

          The research focuses on the steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends under energy-efficient conditions, with a steam-to-carbon ratio slightly higher than stoichiometric (1.8) and temperatures near 650°C. The study aims to understand catalyst deactivation for the development of a process to reform E85 at less energy-intensive conditions. The regeneration and preemptive air treatment methods are explored to maintain catalyst stability. Aging tests with sulfur-free E85 under varying space velocities and catalyst loadings show that under high space velocity conditions, the catalyst is unstable regardless of sulfur presence. The addition of 5 ppm sulfur leads to significant deactivation after 22 hours, making hydrogen production industrially unfeasible. Air treatment can regenerate the catalyst to initial activity, but deactivation occurs faster post-regeneration. A preemptive regeneration process extends the stable activity period for sulfur-containing fuels. XPS studies indicate a shift in precious metal oxidation state during continuous operation versus periodic air treatments.

          本研究关注在近650°C的条件下，能量效率较高的乙醇/汽油混合物蒸汽重整，蒸汽与碳的比例略高于理论值(1.8)。研究旨在理解催化剂失活，以便开发在较不耗能条件下重整E85的过程。研究了再生和预先空气处理方法以维持催化剂稳定性。在不同空间速度和催化剂负载下进行的硫化物无E85老化测试显示，在高空间速度条件下，无论是否含有硫，催化剂稳定性都不稳定。向燃料中添加5 ppm硫导致22小时后测量到失活，使工业上制氢变得不可行。空气处理可以将催化剂恢复至初始活性，但再生后失活发生得更快。利用预先再生过程可以延长含硫燃料重整的稳定期。XPS研究揭示了连续运行与周期性空气处理相比，催化剂上贵金属氧化态的变化。

          Higher hydrocarbons, especially aromatics, increase deactivation due to carbon buildup. Sulfur, present in many transportation fuels, acts as a catalyst poison and negatively impacts catalyst stability. Steam reforming for transportation fuels often focuses on synthetic fuels. It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene, contribute to deactivation by causing coke formation. Adding 5 ppm sulfur leads to significant deactivation after 22 hours, making industrial hydrogen production unfeasible. Air treatment can restore catalyst activity, but deactivation occurs faster post-regeneration. A preemptive regeneration process can extend the stable activity period for sulfur-containing fuels. Key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions are typically explored to optimize catalytic processes in this field.

          高级烃，尤其是芳香烃，会因为碳沉积导致催化剂失活增加。许多运输燃料中都存在的硫被视为催化剂毒物，并对催化剂稳定性产生负面影响。运输燃料的蒸汽重整往往集中在合成燃料上。在特定条件下，可能由乙烷等C2中间体导致催化剂失活，原因是它们可能导致焦炭形成。向燃料中添加5 ppm硫导致22小时后显著失活，使得工业氢生成变得不可行。空气处理可以恢复催化剂活性，但再生后失活发生得更快。采取预先再生过程可以延长含硫燃料重整的稳定期。在这一领域优化催化过程的关键研究方法、表征技术及反应条件通常是被探索的。

          <p>An aging test was performed with sulfur-free E85 under two sets of experimental conditions where the space velocities and catalyst loadings differed. At both the low and high space velocity condition a steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained.</p>
          <p>For the low space velocity condition and high catalyst loading (washcoat loading 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV 22,000 h−1) it was found that the catalyst reformed the ethanol/gasoline mix to equilibrium product distribution with no change in activity for at least 110 h on stream.</p>
          <p>The sulfur-free E85 was then tested with a lower catalyst washcoat loading (0.015 g/cm3) and higher GHSV (44,000 h−1). The result of a 4 h run at these conditions is shown in Fig. 2. Deactivation was measured immediately upon introducing reactants.</p>
          <p>During the high space velocity test, in addition to the major gas species, C2 species of ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ethane were observed in the effluent. It was reported in previous work that reforming pure ethanol at high space velocity produced both acetaldehyde and ethylene with the same catalyst used in this study at high space velocity conditions.</p>
          <p>The reforming of E85 containing 5 ppm sulfur was studied at the low space velocity condition described in Section 3.1 (steam/carbon = 1.8, washcoat loading = 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV = 22,000 h−1). At these conditions, for which no deactivation was measured reforming the sulfur-free fuel, significant catalyst deactivation was measured with sulfur.</p>
          <p>Aging tests at process conditions with sulfur and regeneration were conducted. The catalyst was capable of reforming the sulfur containing fuel to the estimated equilibrium product distribution and full conversion but measured deactivation occurred after some period of time on stream. Regeneration was attempted in atmospheres of: 100% N2, 80% N2/20% steam and 50% N2/50% air.</p>
          <p>XPS studies were completed on a regenerated catalyst. The washcoated monolith exposed to reforming conditions for 105 h with sulfur containing fuel was placed in the TGA/DTA where it was exposed to 50% N2/50% air at 650 C. Despite the significant coking which occurred during the reforming condition, and the considerable exposure to sulfur, following the oxidative regeneration XPS results found neither sulfur, nor graphitic carbon on the catalyst surface.</p>

          An aging test was carried out with sulfur-free E85 under different space velocities and catalyst loadings. At low space velocity conditions with a high catalyst loading (washcoat loading 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV 22,000 h−1), the catalyst successfully reformed the ethanol/gasoline blend to equilibrium product distribution without activity change for at least 110 hours. Testing with a lower catalyst washcoat loading (0.015 g/cm3) and higher GHSV (44,000 h−1) led to immediate deactivation upon introducing reactants. In high space velocity tests, C2 species like ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ethane were observed in the effluent. Previous work showed that reforming pure ethanol at high space velocity produced acetaldehyde and ethylene under similar conditions. Studying E85 with 5 ppm sulfur under low space velocity conditions (steam/carbon = 1.8, washcoat loading = 0.12 g/cm3, GHSV = 22,000 h−1) resulted in significant catalyst deactivation with sulfur. Aging tests with sulfur and regeneration were conducted, where the catalyst could reform the sulfur-containing fuel to equilibrium product distribution and full conversion, but experienced measured deactivation over time. Regeneration attempts were made in various atmospheres (100% N2, 80% N2/20% steam, 50% N2/50% air). XPS studies on the regenerated catalyst showed no sulfur or graphitic carbon on the surface after oxidative regeneration.

          在不同空间速度和催化剂负载下进行了硫化物无E85的老化测试。在低空间速度条件下，高催化剂负载（涂布负载0.12 g/cm3，GHSV 22,000 h−1），催化剂成功将乙醇/汽油混合物重新组合到平衡产品分布中，且没有活动变化，至少持续110小时。在较低催化剂涂布负载（0.015 g/cm3）和更高GHSV（44,000 h−1）的情况下，一旦引入反应物就立即观察到了失活。在高空间速度测试中，在排出物中观察到了乙烷、乙醛和乙烯等C2物种。先前的工作表明，在高空间速度下重整纯乙醇产生了乙醛和乙烯，与本研究中使用的催化剂在高空间速度条件下相同。在描述为第3.1节的低空间速度条件下研究了含有5 ppm硫的E85，结果发现存在硫导致显著的催化剂失活。在含有硫和再生的工艺条件下进行老化测试，催化剂能够将含硫燃料重新组合到估计的平衡产品分布和完全转化中，但在流过一段时间后出现了测量到的失活。尝试了在各种气氛（100% N2、80% N2/20%蒸汽、50% N2/50%空气）下进行再生。在氧化再生后的XPS研究中，未在催化剂表面上发现硫或石墨碳。
