<p>The current work focuses on studying the reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends.</p>
          <p>There has been extensive research on the reforming of conventional transportation fuels of gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel and additionally there are many published studies on the reforming of pure ethanol, however, literature on ethanol-gasoline blends is limited.</p>
          <p>In this paper deactivation, regeneration and stability of a Rh/Pt catalyst on a zirconia containing carrier is studied for the steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends at an energy efficient condition with steam/fuel ratio's slightly higher than stoichiometric (steam/carbon = 1.8) and with temperatures at or near 650 C.</p>
          <p>The objective of this study is to understand catalyst deactivation in order to develop a process for reforming E85 at less energy intensive conditions. The process of regeneration and preemptive air treatment is studied as a method for maintaining catalyst stability.</p>
          <p>Aging tests were performed with sulfur-free E85 under two sets of experimental conditions where the space velocities and catalyst loadings differed.</p>
          <p>At both the low and high space velocity condition a steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained.</p>
          <p>Under high space velocity conditions the catalyst was not stable reforming E85 with or without sulfur.</p>
          <p>The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible.</p>
          <p>Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration.</p>
          <p>A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel.</p>
          <p>XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated that the addition of rhenium leads to a catalyst with greater stability and improved selectivity.</p>
          <p>However, the structure and exact role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts have been a matter of controversy.</p>
          <p>It has been shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts is significantly higher than over its monometallic counterparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12).</p>
          <p>In addition, TPR-studies (1315) have indicated possible reduction mechanisms leading to the formation of bimetallic PtRe metal particles.</p>
          <p>The most common explanation of the properties of the catalyst is based on PtRe alloy formation (5) and the interaction of such an alloy with sulphur (69).</p>
          <p>More direct evidence of alloy formation from physical characterisation techniques such as IR and XPS has been difficult to obtain due to the low metal loading and high metal dispersion in the PtRe reforming catalysts.</p>
          <p>It was established that bimetallic interaction in PtRe/Al2O3 catalysts is highly dependent on the pretreatment conditions. The highest degree of PtRe interaction was found when the catalyst was not dehydrated prior to reduction, while drying in N2 at high temperatures before reduction causes sintering of platinum particles and low bimetallic interaction.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated that the addition of rhenium leads to a catalyst with greater stability and improved selectivity.</p>
          <p>However, the structure and exact role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts have been a matter of controversy.</p>
          <p>It has been shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts is significantly higher than over its monometallic counterparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12).</p>
          <p>In addition, TPR-studies (1315) have indicated possible reduction mechanisms leading to the formation of bimetallic PtRe metal particles.</p>
          <p>The most common explanation of the properties of the catalyst is based on PtRe alloy formation (5) and the interaction of such an alloy with sulphur (69).</p>
          <p>More direct evidence of alloy formation from physical characterisation techniques such as IR and XPS has been difficult to obtain due to the low metal loading and high metal dispersion in the PtRe reforming catalysts.</p>
          <p>It was established that bimetallic interaction in PtRe/Al2O3 catalysts is highly dependent on the pretreatment conditions. The highest degree of PtRe interaction was found when the catalyst was not dehydrated prior to reduction, while drying in N2 at high temperatures before reduction causes sintering of platinum particles and low bimetallic interaction.</p>
