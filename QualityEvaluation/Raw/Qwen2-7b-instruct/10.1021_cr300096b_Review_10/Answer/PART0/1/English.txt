The research focuses on the steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends under energy-efficient conditions, with a steam-to-carbon ratio slightly higher than stoichiometric (1.8) and temperatures near 650°C. The study aims to understand catalyst deactivation for the development of a process to reform E85 at less energy-intensive conditions. The regeneration and preemptive air treatment methods are explored to maintain catalyst stability. Aging tests with sulfur-free E85 under varying space velocities and catalyst loadings show that under high space velocity conditions, the catalyst is unstable regardless of sulfur presence. The addition of 5 ppm sulfur leads to significant deactivation after 22 hours, making hydrogen production industrially unfeasible. Air treatment can regenerate the catalyst to initial activity, but deactivation occurs faster post-regeneration. A preemptive regeneration process extends the stable activity period for sulfur-containing fuels. XPS studies indicate a shift in precious metal oxidation state during continuous operation versus periodic air treatments.

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are pivotal in various industrial applications, including chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Catalyst studies, particularly those employing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques, significantly advance our understanding of these processes. Common research methods involve examining the dehydrogenation of C-H and N-H bonds over supported catalysts.

Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, it is crucial to understand the complex interplay between the chemical transformations and the catalytic processes. These reactions enable the conversion of hydrocarbons and other hydrophilic compounds into valuable fuels and chemicals, contributing significantly to the energy sector. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies play pivotal roles in elucidating the mechanisms of dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Reactor studies often involve the examination of reaction kinetics, product yields, and selectivities under various operational conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition. These experiments provide insights into the effectiveness of different catalysts and their ability to optimize the desired reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The addition of rhenium to a catalyst enhances its stability and selectivity. However, the role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts remains controversial. Studies show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenolysis activity compared to their monometallic counterparts and physical mixtures. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests reduction mechanisms forming bimetallic PtRe particles. The catalyst's properties are often attributed to PtRe alloy formation and its interaction with sulfur. Direct evidence of alloy formation through physical characterization techniques like infrared and XPS is challenging due to low metal loading and dispersion in PtRe reforming catalysts. Bimetallic interaction in PtRe/Al2O3 catalysts depends significantly on pretreatment conditions; without dehydration before reduction, the highest PtRe interaction is observed, whereas high-temperature N2 drying before reduction leads to platinum particle sintering and reduced bimetallic interaction.
