Key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions are typically investigated to optimize catalytic processes in this field. These studies provide insights into catalyst performance under various conditions, helping to identify optimal operating parameters and improve the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic reactions.

Catalytic reforming of naphtha typically employs a bifunctional catalyst with a hydrogenating metal and an acid function. The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) is employed as a metric for evaluating the platinum dispersion in the catalyst. It is demonstrated that hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts exceeds that of their monometallic counterparts and physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3. Hydrogenolysis, being a structure-sensitive reaction, serves as a diagnostic tool for assessing the formation of PtRe alloys. Prior treatments significantly alter the reactivity of rhenium and the extent of PtRe alloy formation. To optimize the utilization of the allocated beam time at the ESRF and Brookhaven laboratories, samples were dried and reduced off-site in our laboratory. Volumetric hydrogen chemisorption was executed at 25°C using a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 apparatus. All spectra were recorded at room temperature. Our method of data analysis was akin to that utilized by Fung et al.
