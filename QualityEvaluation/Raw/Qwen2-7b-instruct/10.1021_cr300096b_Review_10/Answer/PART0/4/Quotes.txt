<p>The catalytic reforming of naphtha is usually performed using a bifunctional catalyst containing both a hydrogenating metal and an acid function.</p>
          <p>The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been used as a measure of the platinum dispersion in the catalysts.</p>
          <p>It has been shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts is significantly higher than over its monometallic counterparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12).</p>
          <p>Hydrogenolysis is a structure-sensitive reaction and has therefore been used as a probe reaction to determine PtRe alloy formation.</p>
          <p>Previous studies indicate that the treatment of the catalyst prior to reduction strongly modifies the reducibility of rhenium and the extent of PtRe alloy formation.</p>
          <p>In order to use the allocated beam time at the ESRF and Brookhaven laboratories as efficiently as possible the samples were dried and reduced ex situ in our home laboratory.</p>
          <p>The volumetric hydrogen chemisorption measurements were performed in a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 instrument at 25C.</p>
          <p>All spectra were collected at room temperature.</p>
          <p>Our approach to the data analysis was similar to that used by Fung et al.</p>
