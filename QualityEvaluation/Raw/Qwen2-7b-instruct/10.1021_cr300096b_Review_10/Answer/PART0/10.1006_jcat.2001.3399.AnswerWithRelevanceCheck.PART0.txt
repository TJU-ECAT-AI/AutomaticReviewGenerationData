          <p>It has been demonstrated that the addition of rhenium leads to a catalyst with greater stability and improved selectivity.</p>
          <p>However, the structure and exact role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts have been a matter of controversy.</p>
          <p>It has been shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts is significantly higher than over its monometallic counterparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12).</p>
          <p>In addition, TPR-studies (1315) have indicated possible reduction mechanisms leading to the formation of bimetallic PtRe metal particles.</p>
          <p>The most common explanation of the properties of the catalyst is based on PtRe alloy formation (5) and the interaction of such an alloy with sulphur (69).</p>
          <p>More direct evidence of alloy formation from physical characterisation techniques such as IR and XPS has been difficult to obtain due to the low metal loading and high metal dispersion in the PtRe reforming catalysts.</p>
          <p>It was established that bimetallic interaction in PtRe/Al2O3 catalysts is highly dependent on the pretreatment conditions. The highest degree of PtRe interaction was found when the catalyst was not dehydrated prior to reduction, while drying in N2 at high temperatures before reduction causes sintering of platinum particles and low bimetallic interaction.</p>

          The addition of rhenium to a catalyst enhances its stability and selectivity. However, the role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts remains controversial. Studies show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenolysis activity compared to their monometallic counterparts and physical mixtures. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests reduction mechanisms forming bimetallic PtRe particles. The catalyst's properties are often attributed to PtRe alloy formation and its interaction with sulfur. Direct evidence of alloy formation through physical characterization techniques like infrared and XPS is challenging due to low metal loading and dispersion in PtRe reforming catalysts. Bimetallic interaction in PtRe/Al2O3 catalysts depends significantly on pretreatment conditions; without dehydration before reduction, the highest PtRe interaction is observed, whereas high-temperature N2 drying before reduction leads to platinum particle sintering and reduced bimetallic interaction.

          添加铼到催化剂中可以提高其稳定性和选择性。然而，铼在铂铼催化剂中的作用仍然存在争议。研究表明，双金属催化剂的氢解活性比单金属催化剂和物理混合物更高。热重分析表明可能有还原机制导致形成双金属PtRe颗粒。催化剂的性质通常归因于铂铼合金的形成及其与硫的相互作用。通过红外和XPS等物理表征技术直接获得合金形成的证据较为困难，这是由于铂铼重整催化剂中的低金属负载和高金属分散性。铂铼/氧化铝催化剂中双金属相互作用的高度依赖于预处理条件；在还原前未脱水的情况下，观察到了最高的铂铼相互作用，而高温氮气干燥前的还原导致铂粒子烧结和降低双金属相互作用。

          The catalytic reforming of naphtha typically involves the use of a bifunctional catalyst with both hydrogenating metal and acid functionalities. The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) serves as a metric for evaluating platinum dispersion in catalysts. It is established that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts surpasses that of monometallic counterparts and physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3. Hydrogenolysis being a structure-sensitive reaction, it acts as a diagnostic tool for assessing the formation of PtRe alloys. Prior treatments affect the reactivity of rhenium and the extent of PtRe alloy formation. To optimize the utilization of allocated beam time at the ESRF and Brookhaven laboratories, samples were dried and reduced outside the lab. Volumetric hydrogen chemisorption was measured at 25°C using a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 instrument. All spectra were acquired at room temperature. Our analytical methodology paralleled that adopted by Fung et al.

          Catalytic reforming of naphtha is typically carried out with a bifunctional catalyst featuring both a hydrogenating metal and an acid functionality. The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) serves as a metric for quantifying platinum dispersion in the catalyst. It is documented that hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts outperforms monometallic equivalents and physical blends of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3. Hydrogenolysis being a structure-sensitive process, it is utilized as an indicator for the formation of PtRe alloys. Prior treatments notably influence rhenium's reactivity and the extent of PtRe alloy formation. To maximize the use of allocated beam time at the ESRF and Brookhaven facilities, samples underwent drying and offline reduction in-house. Volumetric hydrogen chemisorption was conducted at 25°C using a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 apparatus. All spectra were gathered at room temperature. Our analytical strategy mirrored that of Fung et al.
