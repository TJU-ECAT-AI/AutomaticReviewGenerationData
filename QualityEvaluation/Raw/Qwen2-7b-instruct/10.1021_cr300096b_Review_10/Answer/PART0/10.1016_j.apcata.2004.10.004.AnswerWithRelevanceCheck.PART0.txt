          [1] "An accurate nature of PtSn systems is very complicated and still a matter of debate."
          [2] "The addition of tin notably modifies this selectivity by a strong inhibition of cracking reactions."
          [3] "The presence of tin changes the electronic environment of platinum atoms."
          [4] "The EXAFS profiles of PtSnA0.4 and PtSnA1.6 samples exhibit some differences."
          [5] "The coexistence of an unalloyed metallic Pt phase can be confirmed considering the quantity of Pt and Sn atoms in the PtSnA1.6 and PtSnS0.7 catalysts."
          [6] "For all the studied catalysts there is a diminution in the reaction rate as the Sn(0)/Pt increases."
          [7] "Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results performed in this work, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts,prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential reactionregeneration cycles, recover- ing the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without modifications."

          Analyzing the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, it is crucial to understand the complex interplay between the chemical transformations and the catalytic processes. These reactions enable the conversion of hydrocarbons and other hydrophilic compounds into valuable fuels and chemicals, contributing significantly to the energy sector. Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies play pivotal roles in elucidating the mechanisms of dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. Reactor studies often involve the examination of reaction kinetics, product yields, and selectivities under various operational conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition. These experiments provide insights into the effectiveness of different catalysts and their ability to optimize the desired reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions. UHV studies, on the other hand, offer a more microscopic perspective by characterizing the surface properties of catalysts, such as the coordination environment around metal centers, bond strengths, and adsorbate coverage. Techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy are instrumental in revealing the electronic states and local structures of catalysts, providing critical information on the active sites and their dynamics during the dehydrogenation process.
