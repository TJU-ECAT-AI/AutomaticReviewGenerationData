<p>An aging test was performed with sulfur-free E85 under two sets of experimental conditions where the space velocities and catalyst loadings differed. At both the low and high space velocity condition a steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained.</p>
          <p>For the low space velocity condition and high catalyst loading (washcoat loading 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV 22,000 h−1) it was found that the catalyst reformed the ethanol/gasoline mix to equilibrium product distribution with no change in activity for at least 110 h on stream.</p>
          <p>The sulfur-free E85 was then tested with a lower catalyst washcoat loading (0.015 g/cm3) and higher GHSV (44,000 h−1). The result of a 4 h run at these conditions is shown in Fig. 2. Deactivation was measured immediately upon introducing reactants.</p>
          <p>During the high space velocity test, in addition to the major gas species, C2 species of ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ethane were observed in the effluent. It was reported in previous work that reforming pure ethanol at high space velocity produced both acetaldehyde and ethylene with the same catalyst used in this study at high space velocity conditions.</p>
          <p>The reforming of E85 containing 5 ppm sulfur was studied at the low space velocity condition described in Section 3.1 (steam/carbon = 1.8, washcoat loading = 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV = 22,000 h−1). At these conditions, for which no deactivation was measured reforming the sulfur-free fuel, significant catalyst deactivation was measured with sulfur.</p>
          <p>Aging tests at process conditions with sulfur and regeneration were conducted. The catalyst was capable of reforming the sulfur containing fuel to the estimated equilibrium product distribution and full conversion but measured deactivation occurred after some period of time on stream. Regeneration was attempted in atmospheres of: 100% N2, 80% N2/20% steam and 50% N2/50% air.</p>
          <p>XPS studies were completed on a regenerated catalyst. The washcoated monolith exposed to reforming conditions for 105 h with sulfur containing fuel was placed in the TGA/DTA where it was exposed to 50% N2/50% air at 650 C. Despite the significant coking which occurred during the reforming condition, and the considerable exposure to sulfur, following the oxidative regeneration XPS results found neither sulfur, nor graphitic carbon on the catalyst surface.</p>

          <p>The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) has been used as a measure of the platinum dispersion in the catalysts.</p>
          <p>It has been shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts is significantly higher than over its monometallic counterparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mixtures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12).</p>
