An aging test was carried out with sulfur-free E85 under different space velocities and catalyst loadings. At low space velocity conditions with a high catalyst loading (washcoat loading 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV 22,000 h−1), the catalyst successfully reformed the ethanol/gasoline blend to equilibrium product distribution without activity change for at least 110 hours. Testing with a lower catalyst washcoat loading (0.015 g/cm3) and higher GHSV (44,000 h−1) led to immediate deactivation upon introducing reactants. In high space velocity tests, C2 species like ethylene, acetaldehyde, and ethane were observed in the effluent. Previous work showed that reforming pure ethanol at high space velocity produced acetaldehyde and ethylene under similar conditions. Studying E85 with 5 ppm sulfur under low space velocity conditions (steam/carbon = 1.8, washcoat loading = 0.12 g/cm3, GHSV = 22,000 h−1) resulted in significant catalyst deactivation with sulfur. Aging tests with sulfur and regeneration were conducted, where the catalyst could reform the sulfur-containing fuel to equilibrium product distribution and full conversion, but experienced measured deactivation over time. Regeneration attempts were made in various atmospheres (100% N2, 80% N2/20% steam, 50% N2/50% air). XPS studies on the regenerated catalyst showed no sulfur or graphitic carbon on the surface after oxidative regeneration.

Catalytic reforming of naphtha is typically carried out with a bifunctional catalyst featuring both a hydrogenating metal and an acid functionality. The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane (MCH) serves as a metric for quantifying platinum dispersion in the catalyst. It is documented that hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts outperforms monometallic equivalents and physical blends of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3. Hydrogenolysis being a structure-sensitive process, it is utilized as an indicator for the formation of PtRe alloys. Prior treatments notably influence rhenium's reactivity and the extent of PtRe alloy formation. To maximize the use of allocated beam time at the ESRF and Brookhaven facilities, samples underwent drying and offline reduction in-house. Volumetric hydrogen chemisorption was conducted at 25°C using a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 apparatus. All spectra were gathered at room temperature. Our analytical strategy mirrored that of Fung et al.
