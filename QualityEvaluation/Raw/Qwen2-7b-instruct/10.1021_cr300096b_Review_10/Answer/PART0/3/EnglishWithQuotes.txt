It is documented that hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic catalysts outperforms monometallic equivalents and physical blends of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3. Hydrogenolysis being a structure-sensitive process, it is utilized as an indicator for the formation of PtRe alloys. Prior treatments notably influence rhenium's reactivity and the extent of PtRe alloy formation. To maximize the use of allocated beam time at the ESRF and Brookhaven facilities, samples underwent drying and offline reduction in-house. Volumetric hydrogen chemisorption was conducted at 25°C using a Micromeretics ASAP 2010 apparatus. All spectra were gathered at room temperature. Our analytical strategy mirrored that of Fung et al.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.2001.3399"},
