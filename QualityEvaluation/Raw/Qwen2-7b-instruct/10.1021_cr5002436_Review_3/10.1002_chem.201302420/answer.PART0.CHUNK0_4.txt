[1] "Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1,2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides."
[2] "It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis."
[3] "However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."
[4] "In the dry feed bulk Mo2C predominantly produces propylene (S=44%) with the byproducts CH4 and ethylene."
[5] "A strong impact of the dynamics of surface oxygen and carbon, however, is evidenced by the initial selectivity to propylene of the in situ prepared silica supported catalyst, which is zero and increases with time on stream."
[6] "The reactions of n-butane over Mo oxycarbide have been extensively studied by Ledoux etal.,6,10,14 who described a carbon-modified MoCxOy phase being selective to C4 olefin products in a H2/C4H10/H2O feed."
[7] "This finding goes in parallel with more common Cr/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 systems."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the development of catalysts that can efficiently convert paraffins into olefins while minimizing the use of scarce and expensive noble metals. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the selectivity of the catalyst towards propylene production in the dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the dynamics of surface oxygen and carbon. The carbon-modified MoCxOy phase is selective to C4 olefin products in a hydrogenated feed, demonstrating the potential of these materials for paraffin dehydrogenation. This finding aligns with the behavior observed in Cr/Al2O3 or PtSn/Al2O3 systems, highlighting the versatility of transition metal oxides in catalysis.

对钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和CrOx的替代品进行探索，主要是出于寻找更经济高效且环境友好的催化剂的考虑。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展起来，专注于开发能够有效将烷烃转化为烯烃同时减少稀缺昂贵贵金属使用的催化剂。载体类型、支撑表面面积以及金属负载等变量对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为具有关键影响。例如，催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的丙烯选择性受到表面氧和碳动态的影响。MoCxOy相的碳修饰显示出在氢化条件下选择性产生C4烯烃的能力，这凸显了过渡金属氧化物在催化领域的应用潜力。这一发现与Cr/Al2O3或PtSn/Al2O3系统的行为一致，表明了这些材料在催化方面的灵活性。
