Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1,2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides. It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis. The direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes is of high interest in the chemical industry and reported over bulk and supported molybdenum carbide and oxycarbide for ethane,3 propane,4,5 and butane.610 The relatively low number of studies concerning this topic reflects the difficulties associated with these reactions, namely severe deactivation, a complex reaction network, and the dynamic nature of the carbide surface.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find cheaper and more abundant catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the performance of vanadium oxide-based catalysts.
