[1] "Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1,2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides."
[2] "It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis."
[3] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."
[4] "Catalytic experiments on undoped β-Mo2C reveal that the critical temperature for stable operation conditions in the oxygen-free feed is in between 500550C (Figure1)."
[5] "The effects of the dynamics of surface O and C in carbide catalysts on the performance necessitates a study of the stability and reactivity of Mo2C under different oxidative potentials (Table1)."
[6] "At this point it is of interest to compare the reaction rates over molybdenum carbide with chemically different systems studied in propane dehydrogenation: The formation rate of propylene over a 0.5% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst19 at 600C in 25% C3H8/H2 is in the range of 2040μmolg1min1."
[7] "Also, a 13% Cr/Al2O3 catalyst26 at 550C in 9% C3H8/He gives C3H6 formation rates ranging from 70120μmolg1h1 at C3H8 conversions of 2545%."
[8] "The observed changes in surface oxidation are represented by the peak integrals plotted over time on stream (Figure5)."
[9] "Unfortunately, the binary carbide is less stable in the presence of H2O (and CO2) in the feed and partially decomposes into MoO2, likely due to the higher oxophilicity of V."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides in paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the desire to find more affordable and abundant materials for applications in fuel cells and energy-related catalysis, given the scarcity and cost of noble metals. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the properties of vanadium carbides and oxycarbons, particularly regarding their reactivity and stability under various conditions.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The carrier type can affect the dispersion of vanadium, influencing its reactivity and stability. Support surface area impacts the overall activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium, which in turn affects the catalytic performance and stability of the catalyst.

3. The formation of vanadium carbides, like molybdenum carbides, can be influenced by the type of oxide precursor used, as demonstrated by the study of the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C through carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide.

4. The critical temperature for stable operation conditions in the oxygen-free feed for undoped β-Mo2C lies between 500 and 550°C, as revealed by catalytic experiments.

5. The stability and reactivity of molybdenum carbide under different oxidative potentials have been studied to understand how variables like hydrogen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and oxygen impact its performance.

6. The reaction rates over molybdenum carbides compared to different catalysts like platinum on alumina and chromium on aluminum oxide demonstrate varying efficiencies in dehydrogenating propane to propylene, indicating differences in their catalytic activities and selectivities.

7. The dynamics of surface oxygen and carbon in carbide catalysts have been investigated to understand how they affect the performance of molybdenum carbides under different oxidative potentials, highlighting the importance of controlling these dynamics for optimal catalytic activity.

8. The presence of water and carbon dioxide in the feed can destabilize vanadium carbides, leading to partial decomposition into molybdenum oxides, as observed in the study.
