[1] "Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1,2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides."
[2] "It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis."
[3] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."
[4] "Sn, especially in combination with platinum as Pt-Sn/Al2O3 is one of the most popular promoters.12 However, Cu-based catalysts also provided a surprisingly high propylene productivity even at low temperatures."
[5] "Vanadium exhibits a higher oxophilicity than Mo. The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."
[6] "Unfortunately, the binary carbide is less stable in the presence of H2O (and CO2) in the feed and partially decomposes into MoO2, likely due to the higher oxophilicity of V."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has gained interest due to the desire to substitute scarce and expensive noble metals in applications like fuel cells and energy-related catalysis. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on catalysts' performance and stability under various conditions. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play significant roles in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The use of vanadium often improves catalyst stability, although it can also lead to instability when water or carbon dioxide is present in the feed, causing the binary carbide to decompose into molybdate compounds.

对钯和铬氧化物作为烷基化脱氢催化剂的替代品，使用钒氧化物基催化剂以替代稀缺且昂贵的贵金属在燃料电池和能源相关催化应用中的兴趣正在增长。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展，重点是催化剂在不同条件下的性能和稳定性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对确定这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为至关重要。使用钒通常可以提高催化剂的稳定性，但当气体流中含有水分或二氧化碳时，二元碳化物可能分解成钼酸盐化合物，导致稳定性降低。
