[1] "Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1,2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides."
[2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."
[3] "Vanadium exhibits a higher oxophilicity than Mo. The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."
[4] "Unfortunately, the binary carbide is less stable in the presence of H2O (and CO2) in the feed and partially decomposes into MoO2, likely due to the higher oxophilicity of V."
[5] "As the reaction progresses at  500C, the strong hydrogenolysis sites are deactivated by carbon deposition, which can serve as an additional source of CH4 formation via methanation."
[6] "However, the optimization of the process conditions requires a balance between phase stability, coking, activity, and selectivity, which are all senstive to the variation of reaction conditions."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the role of vanadium species and the impact of various factors on catalyst performance. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium in these catalysts. The introduction of vanadium doping, for instance, has been shown to stabilize the redox properties of molybdenum carbides and enhance their catalytic activity for dehydrogenation reactions. However, challenges remain, including the instability of the binary carbide in the presence of water or carbon dioxide, which can lead to decomposition and affect catalyst stability and selectivity. Optimizing process conditions to achieve a balance between phase stability, carbon deposition, activity, and selectivity is crucial for effective catalyst performance.

对铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）用于烷烃裂解的替代催化剂，即钒氧化物基催化剂的研究，主要由低成本和环境友好型催化剂的需求驱动。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，对钒物种的作用以及各种因素对催化剂性能的影响有了更深入的理解。载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载等变量影响着这些催化剂中钒的性质和行为。例如，通过掺杂钒可以稳定钼碳化物的还原性，并增强其催化活性。然而，仍存在挑战，如在水或二氧化碳的存在下二元碳化物的不稳定性，可能导致分解并影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。优化过程条件以实现相稳定性、碳沉积、活性和选择性的平衡对于有效催化剂性能至关重要。
