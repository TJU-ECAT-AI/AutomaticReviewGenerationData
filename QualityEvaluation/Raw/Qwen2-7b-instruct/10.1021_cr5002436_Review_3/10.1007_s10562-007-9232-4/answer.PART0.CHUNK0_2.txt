[1] "As the Si/Al ratio of the support HZSM-5 zeolite rises, the acidity of the supported catalysts decreases accordingly, which comes from two aspects: the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5 support and the loss of the acid sites present on gallium oxides."
[2] "It was found that the catalytic behavior was greatly influenced by the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. With increasing Si/Al ratio, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases while the catalytic stability increases."
[3] "The acidity of the deactivated catalysts is also measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 1 as well. It can be seen that the activity decreases severely after propane dehydrogenation reaction for 24 h for all supported gallium oxide catalysts, indicating that part of strong acid sites were poisoned by coke during dehydrogenation process."
[4] "The decrease in the acidity of supported gallium oxide catalysts upon dealumination of support could be attributed to the fact that there is less framework Al species with which gallium oxide can interact to produce medium to strong acid sites."
[5] "Therefore, it could be concluded that the presence of strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts has two contrary roles in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step. The negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

The document explores the role of gallium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, particularly focusing on the influence of the silica-to-alumina (Si/Al) ratio of the HZSM-5 zeolite support. As the Si/Al ratio increases, the acidity of the supported catalysts decreases, affecting their activity and stability. This decrease in acidity is attributed to both a loss of acid sites on the HZSM-5 support and changes in the interaction between the gallium oxide and the support. The presence of strong acid sites enhances catalyst activity by facilitating faster reaction pathways, but also accelerates deactivation through side reactions such as cracking and oligomerization. Dealumination of the HZSM-5 support helps to balance the opposing effects of strong acid sites, leading to enhanced stability and activity in the propane dehydrogenation process.

文档研究了镓氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的作用，特别是支持性沸石HZSM-5硅铝比（Si/Al）的影响。随着Si/Al比的增加，支持催化剂的酸性下降，影响其活性和稳定性。酸性的减少归因于支持HZSM-5上酸位的损失以及镓氧化物与支持物之间的相互作用变化。强酸位的存在通过促进较慢步骤的更快反应途径来增强催化剂活性，但也通过裂解和缩合等副反应加速催化剂的失活。通过HZSM-5的脱铝处理有助于平衡强酸位的对立作用，从而在丙烷脱氢过程中实现增强的稳定性和活性。
