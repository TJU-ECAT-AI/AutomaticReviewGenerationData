[1] "As the Si/Al ratio of the support HZSM-5 zeolite rises, the acidity of the supported catalysts decreases accordingly, which comes from two aspects: the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5 support and the loss of the acid sites present on gallium oxides."
[2] "The initial activity in the propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio while the stability increases."
[3] "The enhanced stability is thought to be caused by the decrease of the acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization."
[4] "In this study, gallium oxide catalysts supported on HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios were characterized by pyridine adsorption FT-IR, model reaction and XPS studies."
[5] "The acidity of the deactivated catalysts is also measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 1 as well."
[6] "The dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide or supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway on the Ga2O3 surface."
[7] "This reduction in the initial dehydrogenation activity correlates very well with the decrease in the activity of cumene cracking as shown in Fig. 5."
[8] "Therefore, the steady state activity of dehydrogenation is determined not only by the initial activity but also by the stability of the catalysts."
[9] "The cumene cracking activity drops 88% for used Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst (after 24 h in propane dehydrogenation) compared with fresh catalyst, while in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) and Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800), the cumene cracking activity falls only 45% and 26%, respectively."

The research explores the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for the dehydrogenation of paraffins. The catalysts' performance and behavior are influenced by factors such as the type of carrier material, the surface area of the support, and the loading of the metal. Research in this field has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing these factors to enhance catalyst efficiency and stability. The presence of strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces can boost activity by accelerating certain reactions, but they can also lead to catalyst deactivation through side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization. The optimal balance of strong acid sites is crucial for achieving high activity and stability, which can be achieved through processes like dealumination of the support material.

该研究探讨了使用钨酸盐氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品，用于芳烃的脱氢。催化剂的性能和行为受载体材料类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因子的影响。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，旨在优化这些因素以提高催化剂的效率和稳定性。强酸性位点的存在可以加速某些反应并增强活性，但它们也可能导致催化剂通过副反应如裂解、多聚化和环化而失效。强酸性位点的适当平衡对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要，这可以通过对支持材料进行脱铝化处理来实现。
