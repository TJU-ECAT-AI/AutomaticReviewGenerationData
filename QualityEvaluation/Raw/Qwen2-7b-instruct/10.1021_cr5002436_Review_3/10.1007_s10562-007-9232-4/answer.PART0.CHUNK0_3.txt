As the Si/Al ratio of the support HZSM-5 zeolite rises, the acidity of the supported catalysts decreases accordingly, which comes from two aspects: the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5 support and the loss of the acid sites present on gallium oxides. The latter was caused by the change in the interaction between Ga2O3 and support. The initial activity in the propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio while the stability increases. The enhanced stability is thought to be caused by the decrease of the acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization.

Answer: The stability of HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation can be improved by increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support. This improvement is attributed to a decrease in the amount of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which reduces coke formation through side reactions such as cracking and oligomerization. The decrease in acidity is caused by both a reduction in acid sites on the HZSM-5 support related to the framework aluminum species and a decrease in acid sites on gallium oxide due to weakened interaction between gallium and the support.

增加支持材料HZSM-5的Si/Al比可以提高镓氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的稳定性。这种改善归因于催化剂上中等到强酸位点数量的减少，减少了通过裂解和缩合等副反应形成的焦炭。酸性的降低是由框架铝物种相关的HZSM-5上的酸位点减少和镓与支持物之间的相互作用减弱导致的镓氧化物上的酸位点减少共同引起的。
