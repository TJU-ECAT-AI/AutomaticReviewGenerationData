<p>Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction which requires relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene. Thermal cracking side reactions are favoured at high temperature, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide has been proposed as an alternative. Rather high selectivity towards propene has been reported over some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [1], supported Cr2O3 [2], and Ga2O3 [3, 4].</p>
<p>In our previous work it was found that the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 may account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability over Ga2O3 catalysts [3].</p>
<p>The initial activity in the propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio while the stability increases. The enhanced stability is thought to be caused by the decrease of the acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the behavior and nature of vanadium species in various catalyst compositions. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the properties of vanadium-based catalysts. For instance, the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been proposed as an alternative promoter for dehydrogenation reactions, potentially enhancing selectivity towards propene over certain catalysts like rare earth vanadates, supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3), and gallium oxide (Ga2O3). The enhanced activity and stability observed in Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2, which contribute to their catalytic performance. The relationship between catalyst activity and stability is complex, as the initial activity decreases with an increase in the Si/Al ratio of the support, while stability increases. This suggests that the balance between acidity and the suppression of side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance. By manipulating the Si/Al ratio, researchers aim to find the right balance that maximizes both initial activity and long-term stability, leading to highly effective and durable catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

对烷烃脱氢反应中铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂的探索，主要是为了寻找更经济和环保的催化剂。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于理解不同载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载对钒基催化剂性质的影响。载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载是影响钒基催化剂性能的关键因素。例如，二氧化碳（CO2）被提议作为脱氢反应的替代促进剂，可能在某些催化剂如稀土钒酸盐、支撑铬酸盐（Cr2O3）和镓氧化物（Ga2O3）上显示出较高的丙烯选择性。Ga2O3催化剂活性和稳定性的增强可能归因于逆水煤气变换反应和CO2的Boudouard反应，这些反应促进了其催化性能。催化剂的活性与稳定性之间的关系较为复杂：随着支持材料中Si/Al比的增加，初始活性降低，而稳定性提高。这表明，活性与抑制副反应（如裂解和聚合化）之间的平衡对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要。通过调整Si/Al比，研究人员旨在找到合适的平衡点，既能最大化初始活性又能保持长期稳定性，从而得到高效耐用的烷烃脱氢过程催化剂。
