[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction which requires relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[2] "Thermal cracking side reactions are favoured at high temperature, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
[3] "It has been found that the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 may account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability over Ga2O3 catalysts."
[4] "The initial activity in the propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio while the stability increases."
[5] "The acid sites on gallium oxide are believed to be Lewis acid sites [24] and the acid sites on HZSM-5 are thought to be Brnsted ones, since the amount of the Lewis acid sites on HZSM-5 is only 7% as that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
[6] "The acidity of the deactivated catalysts is also measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction."
[7] "This is in accordance with the above explanation is that the strong interaction between HZSM-5 and Ga2O3 could generate new strong acid sites."
[8] "Therefore, the steady state activity of dehydrogenation is determined not only by the initial activity but also by the stability of the catalysts."
[9] "The amount of strong acid sites present on supported gallium oxide catalysts should strike a balance between these two contrary aspects, which can be realized through dealumination of HZSM-5 support."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective and more sustainable catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s with the aim of improving catalyst efficiency, stability, and selectivity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Carriers and supports affect the dispersion of vanadium, influencing its reactivity and stability. Higher surface area supports can enhance the active sites available for catalysis. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium species, impacting both activity and stability. The specific interactions between vanadium and the support material, as well as the carrier, play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance. For instance, the stability of these catalysts can be enhanced through dealumination of the support, which reduces the amount of strong acid sites, thus minimizing side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, while maintaining or enhancing the activity by facilitating alternative reaction pathways.

对于正构烷烃脱氢反应，探索使用钨氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品，主要是为了寻找更经济和可持续的催化剂。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展起来，旨在提高催化剂的效率、稳定性和选择性。载体和支撑体对钨物种的性质和行为有着重要影响。载体和支撑体的类型会影响钨的分散度，进而影响其活性和稳定性。更高表面积的支撑体可以增加可用于催化作用的有效位点。金属负载量决定了活性钨物种的浓度，从而影响活性和稳定性。钨与支撑材料以及载体之间的特定相互作用在确定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。例如，通过去铝化支撑体来增强这些催化剂的稳定性，这减少了强酸位的数量，从而减少了裂解和多聚化等副反应，同时通过促进替代反应途径维持或增强活性。
