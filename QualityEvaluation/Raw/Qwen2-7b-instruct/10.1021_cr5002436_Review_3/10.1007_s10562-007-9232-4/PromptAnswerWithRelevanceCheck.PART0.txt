[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction which requires relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[2] "Thermal cracking side reactions are favoured at high temperature, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
[3] "It has been found that the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 may account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability over Ga2O3 catalysts."
[4] "The initial activity in the propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio while the stability increases."
[5] "The acid sites on gallium oxide are believed to be Lewis acid sites [24] and the acid sites on HZSM-5 are thought to be Brnsted ones, since the amount of the Lewis acid sites on HZSM-5 is only 7% as that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5."
[6] "The acidity of the deactivated catalysts is also measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction."
[7] "This is in accordance with the above explanation is that the strong interaction between HZSM-5 and Ga2O3 could generate new strong acid sites."
[8] "Therefore, the steady state activity of dehydrogenation is determined not only by the initial activity but also by the stability of the catalysts."
[9] "The amount of strong acid sites present on supported gallium oxide catalysts should strike a balance between these two contrary aspects, which can be realized through dealumination of HZSM-5 support."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective and more sustainable catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s with the aim of improving catalyst efficiency, stability, and selectivity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Carriers and supports affect the dispersion of vanadium, influencing its reactivity and stability. Higher surface area supports can enhance the active sites available for catalysis. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium species, impacting both activity and stability. The specific interactions between vanadium and the support material, as well as the carrier, play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance. For instance, the stability of these catalysts can be enhanced through dealumination of the support, which reduces the amount of strong acid sites, thus minimizing side reactions like cracking and oligomerization, while maintaining or enhancing the activity by facilitating alternative reaction pathways.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the behavior and nature of vanadium species in various catalyst compositions. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the properties of vanadium-based catalysts. For instance, the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been proposed as an alternative promoter for dehydrogenation reactions, potentially enhancing selectivity towards propene over certain catalysts like rare earth vanadates, supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3), and gallium oxide (Ga2O3). The enhanced activity and stability observed in Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2, which contribute to their catalytic performance. The relationship between catalyst activity and stability is complex, as the initial activity decreases with an increase in the Si/Al ratio of the support, while stability increases. This suggests that the balance between acidity and the suppression of side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance. By manipulating the Si/Al ratio, researchers aim to find the right balance that maximizes both initial activity and long-term stability, leading to highly effective and durable catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

对烷烃脱氢反应中铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂的探索，主要是为了寻找更经济和环保的催化剂。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于理解不同载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载对钒基催化剂性质的影响。载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载是影响钒基催化剂性能的关键因素。例如，二氧化碳（CO2）被提议作为脱氢反应的替代促进剂，可能在某些催化剂如稀土钒酸盐、支撑铬酸盐（Cr2O3）和镓氧化物（Ga2O3）上显示出较高的丙烯选择性。Ga2O3催化剂活性和稳定性的增强可能归因于逆水煤气变换反应和CO2的Boudouard反应，这些反应促进了其催化性能。催化剂的活性与稳定性之间的关系较为复杂：随着支持材料中Si/Al比的增加，初始活性降低，而稳定性提高。这表明，活性与抑制副反应（如裂解和聚合化）之间的平衡对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要。通过调整Si/Al比，研究人员旨在找到合适的平衡点，既能最大化初始活性又能保持长期稳定性，从而得到高效耐用的烷烃脱氢过程催化剂。

[1] "As the Si/Al ratio of the support HZSM-5 zeolite rises, the acidity of the supported catalysts decreases accordingly, which comes from two aspects: the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5 support and the loss of the acid sites present on gallium oxides."
[2] "It was found that the catalytic behavior was greatly influenced by the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. With increasing Si/Al ratio, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases while the catalytic stability increases."
[3] "The acidity of the deactivated catalysts is also measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 1 as well. It can be seen that the activity decreases severely after propane dehydrogenation reaction for 24 h for all supported gallium oxide catalysts, indicating that part of strong acid sites were poisoned by coke during dehydrogenation process."
[4] "The decrease in the acidity of supported gallium oxide catalysts upon dealumination of support could be attributed to the fact that there is less framework Al species with which gallium oxide can interact to produce medium to strong acid sites."
[5] "Therefore, it could be concluded that the presence of strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts has two contrary roles in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step. The negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

The document explores the role of gallium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, particularly focusing on the influence of the silica-to-alumina (Si/Al) ratio of the HZSM-5 zeolite support. As the Si/Al ratio increases, the acidity of the supported catalysts decreases, affecting their activity and stability. This decrease in acidity is attributed to both a loss of acid sites on the HZSM-5 support and changes in the interaction between the gallium oxide and the support. The presence of strong acid sites enhances catalyst activity by facilitating faster reaction pathways, but also accelerates deactivation through side reactions such as cracking and oligomerization. Dealumination of the HZSM-5 support helps to balance the opposing effects of strong acid sites, leading to enhanced stability and activity in the propane dehydrogenation process.

文档研究了镓氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的作用，特别是支持性沸石HZSM-5硅铝比（Si/Al）的影响。随着Si/Al比的增加，支持催化剂的酸性下降，影响其活性和稳定性。酸性的减少归因于支持HZSM-5上酸位的损失以及镓氧化物与支持物之间的相互作用变化。强酸位的存在通过促进较慢步骤的更快反应途径来增强催化剂活性，但也通过裂解和缩合等副反应加速催化剂的失活。通过HZSM-5的脱铝处理有助于平衡强酸位的对立作用，从而在丙烷脱氢过程中实现增强的稳定性和活性。

As the Si/Al ratio of the support HZSM-5 zeolite rises, the acidity of the supported catalysts decreases accordingly, which comes from two aspects: the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5 support and the loss of the acid sites present on gallium oxides. The latter was caused by the change in the interaction between Ga2O3 and support. The initial activity in the propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio while the stability increases. The enhanced stability is thought to be caused by the decrease of the acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization.
</quotes>

Answer: The stability of HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation can be improved by increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support. This improvement is attributed to a decrease in the amount of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which reduces coke formation through side reactions such as cracking and oligomerization. The decrease in acidity is caused by both a reduction in acid sites on the HZSM-5 support related to the framework aluminum species and a decrease in acid sites on gallium oxide due to weakened interaction between gallium and the support.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
增加支持材料HZSM-5的Si/Al比可以提高镓氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的稳定性。这种改善归因于催化剂上中等到强酸位点数量的减少，减少了通过裂解和缩合等副反应形成的焦炭。酸性的降低是由框架铝物种相关的HZSM-5上的酸位点减少和镓与支持物之间的相互作用减弱导致的镓氧化物上的酸位点减少共同引起的。

[5] "The acidity of the deactivated catalysts is also measured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the results are listed in Table 1 as well."
[6] "The dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide or supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway on the Ga2O3 surface."
[7] "This reduction in the initial dehydrogenation activity correlates very well with the decrease in the activity of cumene cracking as shown in Fig. 5."
[8] "Therefore, the steady state activity of dehydrogenation is determined not only by the initial activity but also by the stability of the catalysts."
[9] "The cumene cracking activity drops 88% for used Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst (after 24 h in propane dehydrogenation) compared with fresh catalyst, while in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) and Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800), the cumene cracking activity falls only 45% and 26%, respectively."

The research explores the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for the dehydrogenation of paraffins. The catalysts' performance and behavior are influenced by factors such as the type of carrier material, the surface area of the support, and the loading of the metal. Research in this field has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing these factors to enhance catalyst efficiency and stability. The presence of strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces can boost activity by accelerating certain reactions, but they can also lead to catalyst deactivation through side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization. The optimal balance of strong acid sites is crucial for achieving high activity and stability, which can be achieved through processes like dealumination of the support material.
