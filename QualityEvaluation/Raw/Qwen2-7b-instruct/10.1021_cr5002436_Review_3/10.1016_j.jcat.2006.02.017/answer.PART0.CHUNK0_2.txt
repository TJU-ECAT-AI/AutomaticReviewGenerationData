Journal of Catalysis 239 (2006) 470477 www.elsevier.com/locate/jcat Support effect in dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over supported gallium oxide catalysts Bingjun Xu, Bo Zheng, Weiming Hua , Yinghong Yue , Zi Gao Department of Chemistry and Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, PR China

Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated.

Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane.

The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface.

Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst.

XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

Answer: 
The investigation focused on the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence or presence of CO2 over various supported gallium oxide catalysts. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts demonstrated high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective for propane dehydrogenation. The high activity is associated with the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces. Carbon dioxide promotes the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppresses those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. In the reaction, CO2 plays dual roles: a positive role in removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface via the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst. XPS studies revealed that the diverse behaviors of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts might be attributed to the distinct interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation process is suggested to occur through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

研究集中在不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂上，考察丙烷在无CO2或存在CO2条件下的脱氢。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于丙烷脱氢无效。高活性与催化剂表面中等强度酸性位点的丰富有关。二氧化碳促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的催化脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。在反应中，二氧化碳扮演着双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的氢分子的正面作用，以及通过消除催化剂基本位点上的丙烷吸附的负面影响。XPS研究表明，五种支持的Ga2O3催化剂的不同行为可能归因于支持物与Ga2O3物种之间的不同相互作用。脱氢过程被建议通过异裂解反应途径进行。
