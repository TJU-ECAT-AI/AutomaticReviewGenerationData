[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
[3] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst composition and structure. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Higher surface areas and appropriate metal loadings can enhance the dispersion of vanadium, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. Carrier types can affect the interaction between the vanadium oxide and the support, impacting the overall catalytic performance. The role of these variables in determining the effectiveness of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation involves complex interplay between the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. The heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway is suggested to be the mechanism driving the dehydrogenation process, contributing to the high activity observed in these systems.
