Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The conversions of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600 C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively. The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

The study indicates that Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are effective for propane dehydrogenation, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective. The high activity of the former catalysts correlates with the presence of abundant medium-strong acid sites. Carbon dioxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but has the opposite effect on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

研究表明，Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂对丙烷脱氢具有高效性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO则无效。前者的高活性与表面大量中强酸性位点的存在相关。二氧化碳增强了Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但对Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3产生了相反的效果。

Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Pulse reaction results and hydrogen and propane chemisorption data show that CO2 plays dual roles in the reaction: a positive role in removing dissociatively adsorbed hydrogen from the catalyst surface via the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst.

What factors have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how has research in this area evolved since the 1980s, and how do variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts?
