[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway."

Answer: The investigation focused on the dehydrogenation of propane to propene using different supported gallium oxide catalysts, both in the absence and presence of CO2. Gallium oxide catalysts supported on titanium dioxide (Ga2O3/TiO2), aluminum oxide (Ga2O3/Al2O3), and zirconium oxide (Ga2O3/ZrO2) showed high activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, while silica (Ga2O3/SiO2) and magnesium oxide (Ga2O3/MgO) were ineffective catalysts. The role of CO2 in the reaction was twofold: it promoted the dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed it over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The reaction mechanism was suggested to involve a heterolytic dissociation pathway.

研究重点是考察不同支持型镓氧化物催化剂在无CO2或存在CO2条件下的丙烷脱氢反应，包括丙烷转化为丙烯。镓氧化物催化剂，以钛酸盐（Ga2O3/TiO2）、铝酸盐（Ga2O3/Al2O3）和锆酸盐（Ga2O3/ZrO2）为支持材料，显示出较高的活性。而硅酸盐（Ga2O3/SiO2）和镁酸盐（Ga2O3/MgO）则对丙烷脱氢反应无效。CO2在反应中的作用有两个方面：它促进Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但抑制Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。反应机制被推测通过异裂解反应途径进行。
