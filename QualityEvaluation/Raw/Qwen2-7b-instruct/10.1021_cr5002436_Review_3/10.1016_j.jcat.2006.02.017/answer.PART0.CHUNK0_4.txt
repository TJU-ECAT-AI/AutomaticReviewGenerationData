[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "The conversions of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600 C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively."
[3] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "Dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 600 C;the reaction data are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 3."
[5] "The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of propane over supported gallium oxide catalysts was also studied; the results are shown in Fig. 4."
[6] "To obtain more information on the dehydrogenation of propane over various supported gallium oxide catalysts, CO2 and H2 pulse reaction, as well as CO2 pulse reaction, were carried out."

The investigation into vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and vanadium pentoxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research efforts have focused on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have been crucial in determining the effectiveness and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of different vanadium species within the catalysts can significantly impact their catalytic activity and stability, making it essential to optimize these parameters for optimal performance. The use of vanadium oxide catalysts offers potential economic and environmental benefits compared to traditional catalysts, such as reduced cost and lower environmental impact. The research continues to explore ways to improve the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts, aiming to enhance their performance in the paraffin dehydrogenation process.
