<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst composition and structure. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Higher surface areas and appropriate metal loadings can enhance the dispersion of vanadium, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. Carrier types can affect the interaction between the vanadium oxide and the support, impacting the overall catalytic performance. The role of these variables in determining the effectiveness of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation involves complex interplay between the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. The heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway is suggested to be the mechanism driving the dehydrogenation process, contributing to the high activity observed in these systems.

Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The conversions of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600 C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively. The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

The study indicates that Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are effective for propane dehydrogenation, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective. The high activity of the former catalysts correlates with the presence of abundant medium-strong acid sites. Carbon dioxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but has the opposite effect on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated.

Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane.

The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface.

Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3.

Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst.

XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species.

The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

Answer: 
The investigation focused on the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence or presence of CO2 over various supported gallium oxide catalysts. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts demonstrated high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective for propane dehydrogenation. The high activity is associated with the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces. Carbon dioxide promotes the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppresses those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. In the reaction, CO2 plays dual roles: a positive role in removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface via the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst. XPS studies revealed that the diverse behaviors of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts might be attributed to the distinct interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation process is suggested to occur through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

研究集中在不同支持的镓氧化物催化剂上，考察丙烷在无CO2或存在CO2条件下的脱氢。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO对于丙烷脱氢无效。高活性与催化剂表面中等强度酸性位点的丰富有关。二氧化碳促进了Ga2O3/TiO2的催化脱氢活性，但抑制了Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。在反应中，二氧化碳扮演着双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的氢分子的正面作用，以及通过消除催化剂基本位点上的丙烷吸附的负面影响。XPS研究表明，五种支持的Ga2O3催化剂的不同行为可能归因于支持物与Ga2O3物种之间的不同相互作用。脱氢过程被建议通过异裂解反应途径进行。

Answer: The investigation focused on the dehydrogenation of propane to propene using different supported gallium oxide catalysts, both in the absence and presence of CO2. Gallium oxide catalysts supported on titanium dioxide (Ga2O3/TiO2), aluminum oxide (Ga2O3/Al2O3), and zirconium oxide (Ga2O3/ZrO2) showed high activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, while silica (Ga2O3/SiO2) and magnesium oxide (Ga2O3/MgO) were ineffective catalysts. The role of CO2 in the reaction was twofold: it promoted the dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppressed it over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The reaction mechanism was suggested to involve a heterolytic dissociation pathway.
