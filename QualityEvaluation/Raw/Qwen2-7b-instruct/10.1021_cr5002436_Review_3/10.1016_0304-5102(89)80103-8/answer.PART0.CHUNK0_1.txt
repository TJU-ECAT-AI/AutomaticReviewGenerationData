[L7] "Patent data [ 1 - 31 and literature reports [4 - 71 have shown that pentasil-type zeolites are attractive acid catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes into aromatics."
[L8] "While it was clearly established that the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] was to enhance the production of propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary intermediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory interpreted."
[L9] "On Ga20s, the major reaction of propane was the dehydrogenation into propene."
[L10] "Ga*Os is not active in the polymerization of olefins."
[L11] "Ga,O, catalyzes cyclization of C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons."
[L12] "Ga,O, does not promote hydrogen-transfer reactions between olefins and cycloparaffins, a reaction catalyzed by solid acids."
[L13] "With l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene, and probably with other paraffins, aromatic hydrocarbons are formed via dehydrogenation of the paraffin to generate dienes and trienes."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer competitive catalytic properties at lower costs and environmental benefits. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst components, carrier types, support surface areas, and metal loadings to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of vanadium species. The use of vanadium oxides aims to mimic the catalytic behavior of precious metals while reducing the need for them, which are scarce and expensive. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the stability, reactivity, and selectivity of vanadium species, making them critical parameters in the development of efficient and cost-effective dehydrogenation catalysts.
