[1] "More recently, interest in the dehydrocyclization of propane over H-ZSM-5-supported metals, as well over metal silicates, has been intensified to ascertain the importance of the added metal on the overall reaction."
[2] "While it was clearly established that the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] was to enhance the production of propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary intermediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory interpreted."
[3] "Some recent results [lo] have shown that pure Ga20s, under the conditions of the dehydrocyclization reaction, was active in the dehydrogenation of propane into propene as well in the conversion of methylcyclohexane into toluene."
[4] "It can be concluded that Ga*Os is not active in the polymerization of olefins."
[5] "As stated above, the major product from l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene conversion was benzene, which accounted for over 65% of the hydrocarbons generated over Ga*Os, cyclohexadiene plus cyclohexene accounting for 20%."
[6] "The reaction paths for the dehydrocyclization of l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene can be deduced by comparing the measured product distributions listed in Table 1."
[7] "The work presented above leads us to conclude that GaZOs functions primarily as a dehydrogenation catalyst to form di- and triolefins from olefins, the trienes being rapidly cyclized in a non-catalytic gas phase reaction [12]."
[8] "The remarkable increase in the yield of aromatics from catalytic conversion of propane when H-ZSM-5 was promoted with gallium is thus reasonably understood as the result of the dehydrogenating properties of gallium oxide, which easily generate trienes from alkenes."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the impact of different factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The role of gallium in dehydrocyclization reactions, particularly with propane, has been less clear compared to the established roles of metals like platinum (Pt) and zinc (Zn). However, recent findings suggest that gallium oxide (Ga2O3) can effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the conversion of methylcyclohexane into toluene.

3. Ga2O3 is not active in the polymerization of olefins, indicating its selective role in dehydrogenation processes rather than promoting the formation of larger hydrocarbon molecules.

4. In the context of the dehydrocyclization of hexene and hexadiene, the major products are benzene and cyclohexadiene, with benzene accounting for over 65% of the generated hydrocarbons.

5. The dehydrocyclization reaction paths for hexene and hexadiene can be deduced from the product distribution patterns observed in experiments. These reactions likely proceed through the formation of dienes and trienes, which are then rapidly cyclized in a non-catalytic gas-phase reaction.

6. The remarkable increase in the yield of aromatics from the catalytic conversion of propane, when promoted with gallium, can be attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of gallium oxide. This property allows for the facile generation of trienes from alkenes, facilitating the formation of aromatic compounds.

1. 对于正构烷烃脱氢反应，寻找更经济和环境友好的催化剂，范德华氧化物基催化剂被作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品进行了探索。自1980年代以来，研究领域已显著发展，重点在于理解不同因素如载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载对钒物种性质和行为的影响。

2. 针对丙烷的脱氢环化反应中，镓的作用比铂（Pt）和锌（Zn）更为复杂。然而，最近的研究表明，纯镓氧化物（Ga2O3）在脱氢生成丙烯以及甲基环己烷转化为苯并二氢化物的过程中表现出活性。

3. 镓氧化物（Ga2O3）不促进烯烃聚合反应，表明其在脱氢作用上的选择性，而不是促进形成较大的碳氢化合物分子。

4. 在六碳烯和六碳二烯的脱氢环化过程中，主要产物为苯和环己二烯，其中苯占生成碳氢化合物的65%以上。

5. 通过观察实验中产物分布模式，可以推断出六碳烯和六碳二烯的脱氢环化反应路径。这些反应可能通过形成二烯和三烯进行，随后在非催化气相反应中迅速环化。

6. 当正构烷烃通过镓促进时，从丙烷转化到芳香烃的显著增加，可以归因于镓氧化物的脱氢特性。这一特性允许烯烃容易地生成三烯，从而促进芳香化合物的形成。
