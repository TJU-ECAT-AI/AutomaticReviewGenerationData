[1] "More recently, interest in the dehydrocyclization of propane over H-ZSM-5-supported metals, as well over metal silicates, has been intensified to ascertain the importance of the added metal on the overall reaction."
[2] "It was conclusively shown that metal-H-ZSM-5 catalysts have higher activity and better selectivity towards conversion of propane into aromatics compared with H-ZSM-5."
[3] "While it was clearly established that the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] was to enhance the production of propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary intermediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory interpreted."
[4] "Some recent results [lo] have shown that pure Ga20s, under the conditions of the dehydrocyclization reaction, was active in the dehydrogenation of propane into propene as well in the conversion of methylcyclohexane into toluene."
[5] "The objective of the present work was to further elucidate the role of gallium oxide in the dehydrocyclization reactions."
[6] "Ga*Os is not active in the polymerization of olefins."
[7] "N-hexene was found to react readily over Ga,O, at 773 K."
[8] "The major conversion products were cycloolefins and aromatics, benzene being produced predominantly."
[9] "Over GazOs, with identical experimental conditions, the rates of l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene conversion are comparable and nearly 20 times as fast as propane or cyclohexane dehydrogenation."
[10] "The facts that from the conversion of l-hexene cyclohexane could not be detected, and that from the conversion of 1,5-hexadiene cyclohexene was not formed (selectivity to cyclohexene = 1%) allow the conclusion that formation of cycloparaffins by direct ring closure of the olefins on GazOs can be excluded."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has gained increased interest due to their potential to enhance the overall reaction's efficiency and selectivity, particularly in converting propane into aromatics. Since the 1980s, research in this area has focused on understanding the impact of different factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. These studies have revealed that while Pt and Zn play significant roles in enhancing propene production from propane, the role of gallium has been less clear. Recent findings indicate that gallium oxide (Ga2O3) can actively participate in both dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization processes, showing distinct activity in converting propane into propene and methylcyclohexane into toluene. The current research aims to clarify the role of gallium oxide specifically in dehydrocyclization reactions, highlighting its potential to catalyze the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons through the dehydrogenation of paraffins.

The catalysts containing vanadium oxide demonstrate superior activity and selectivity in the conversion of propane into aromatics compared to those containing only H-ZSM-5. However, the role of gallium in these processes appears to differ significantly from that of metals like Pt and Zn. Gallium oxide does not show activity in the polymerization of olefins but instead exhibits high reactivity towards n-hexene, forming predominantly cycloolefins and aromatics, with benzene being the predominant product. The rates of conversion for n-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene over gallium oxide are notably faster than those for propane or cyclohexane dehydrogenation, suggesting a more efficient conversion pathway. The lack of detection of cyclohexane in the conversion of n-hexene and the absence of cyclohexene in the conversion of 1,5-hexadiene indicate that direct ring closure of olefins on gallium oxide cannot be the primary mechanism for dehydrocyclization. Instead, the process likely involves the formation of dienes and trienes as intermediates before the final ring closure occurs, with trienes undergoing rapid thermal cyclization in the gas phase.

对钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的研究兴趣日益增加，原因在于它们有可能提高整体反应的效率和选择性，特别是促进丙烷转化为芳香烃。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究重点是理解不同因素如载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载如何影响钒物种在这些催化剂中的性质与行为。这些研究表明，尽管Pt和Zn在增强丙烷转化为丙烯方面起着重要作用，但镓的作用则较为模糊。最近的研究发现，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）可以积极参与脱氢和脱氢环化过程，显示出在将丙烷转化为丙烯以及将甲基环己烷转化为苯酚的活性。当前的研究旨在澄清镓氧化物在脱氢环化反应中的作用，突出其通过脱氢烷烃形成芳香烃的潜力。

包含钒氧化物的催化剂在将丙烷转化为芳香烃的活性和选择性方面表现出显著优势，与仅含H-ZSM-5的催化剂相比。然而，镓在这些过程中的作用与Pt和Zn有所不同。镓氧化物在聚合烯烃方面没有表现活性，而是对n-己烯表现出高反应性，主要生成环烯烃和芳香烃，其中苯是主要产物。n-己烯和1,5-己二烯在镓氧化物上的转化速率明显高于丙烷或环己烷脱氢化，表明存在更高效的转化途径。n-己烯转化过程中未检测到环己烷的存在，而1,5-己二烯转化过程中未形成环己烯（环己烯选择性为1%），这表明在镓氧化物上直接进行环闭合机制不可能成为脱氢环化的主要机制。相反，过程可能涉及双烯和三烯作为中间体的形成，在至少形成双烯之后才发生最终环闭合，这意味着环己烷不可能是n-己烯在镓氧化物上脱氢环化过程中的中间体。从研究中得出结论，对于n-己烯和1,5-己二烯而言，以及可能对于其他烷烃而言，通过脱氢烷烃产生双烯和三烯，然后快速在气相反应中进行热环闭合，形成了芳香烃的形成方式。
