The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer competitive catalytic properties at lower costs and environmental benefits. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst components, carrier types, support surface areas, and metal loadings to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of vanadium species. The use of vanadium oxides aims to mimic the catalytic behavior of precious metals while reducing the need for them, which are scarce and expensive. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the stability, reactivity, and selectivity of vanadium species, making them critical parameters in the development of efficient and cost-effective dehydrogenation catalysts.

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the impact of different factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The role of gallium in dehydrocyclization reactions, particularly with propane, has been less clear compared to the established roles of metals like platinum (Pt) and zinc (Zn). However, recent findings suggest that gallium oxide (Ga2O3) can effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the conversion of methylcyclohexane into toluene.

3. Ga2O3 is not active in the polymerization of olefins, indicating its selective role in dehydrogenation processes rather than promoting the formation of larger hydrocarbon molecules.

4. In the context of the dehydrocyclization of hexene and hexadiene, the major products are benzene and cyclohexadiene, with benzene accounting for over 65% of the generated hydrocarbons.

5. The dehydrocyclization reaction paths for hexene and hexadiene can be deduced from the product distribution patterns observed in experiments. These reactions likely proceed through the formation of dienes and trienes, which are then rapidly cyclized in a non-catalytic gas-phase reaction.

6. The remarkable increase in the yield of aromatics from the catalytic conversion of propane, when promoted with gallium, can be attributed to the dehydrogenating properties of gallium oxide. This property allows for the facile generation of trienes from alkenes, facilitating the formation of aromatic compounds.

2. 针对丙烷的脱氢环化反应中，镓的作用比铂（Pt）和锌（Zn）更为复杂。然而，最近的研究表明，纯镓氧化物（Ga2O3）在脱氢生成丙烯以及甲基环己烷转化为苯并二氢化物的过程中表现出活性。

3. 镓氧化物（Ga2O3）不促进烯烃聚合反应，表明其在脱氢作用上的选择性，而不是促进形成较大的碳氢化合物分子。

4. 在六碳烯和六碳二烯的脱氢环化过程中，主要产物为苯和环己二烯，其中苯占生成碳氢化合物的65%以上。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and possibly more selective alternatives. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on understanding the unique catalytic properties of vanadium oxides under different conditions. Key factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables impact the electronic structure and redox properties of vanadium, affecting its ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions efficiently and selectively. For instance, the choice of carrier material can alter the dispersion of vanadium species, influencing their reactivity and stability. Surface area affects the availability of active sites for reaction, while metal loading impacts the concentration of vanadium ions participating in catalytic processes. Overall, optimizing these parameters is crucial for enhancing the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, aiming to achieve higher yields of aromatics with improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has gained increased interest due to their potential to enhance the overall reaction's efficiency and selectivity, particularly in converting propane into aromatics. Since the 1980s, research in this area has focused on understanding the impact of different factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. These studies have revealed that while Pt and Zn play significant roles in enhancing propene production from propane, the role of gallium has been less clear. Recent findings indicate that gallium oxide (Ga2O3) can actively participate in both dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization processes, showing distinct activity in converting propane into propene and methylcyclohexane into toluene. The current research aims to clarify the role of gallium oxide specifically in dehydrocyclization reactions, highlighting its potential to catalyze the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons through the dehydrogenation of paraffins.

The catalysts containing vanadium oxide demonstrate superior activity and selectivity in the conversion of propane into aromatics compared to those containing only H-ZSM-5. However, the role of gallium in these processes appears to differ significantly from that of metals like Pt and Zn. Gallium oxide does not show activity in the polymerization of olefins but instead exhibits high reactivity towards n-hexene, forming predominantly cycloolefins and aromatics, with benzene being the predominant product. The rates of conversion for n-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene over gallium oxide are notably faster than those for propane or cyclohexane dehydrogenation, suggesting a more efficient conversion pathway. The lack of detection of cyclohexane in the conversion of n-hexene and the absence of cyclohexene in the conversion of 1,5-hexadiene indicate that direct ring closure of olefins on gallium oxide cannot be the primary mechanism for dehydrocyclization. Instead, the process likely involves the formation of dienes and trienes as intermediates before the final ring closure occurs, with trienes undergoing rapid thermal cyclization in the gas phase.

对钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的研究兴趣日益增加，原因在于它们有可能提高整体反应的效率和选择性，特别是促进丙烷转化为芳香烃。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究重点是理解不同因素如载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载如何影响钒物种在这些催化剂中的性质与行为。这些研究表明，尽管Pt和Zn在增强丙烷转化为丙烯方面起着重要作用，但镓的作用则较为模糊。最近的研究发现，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）可以积极参与脱氢和脱氢环化过程，显示出在将丙烷转化为丙烯以及将甲基环己烷转化为苯酚的活性。当前的研究旨在澄清镓氧化物在脱氢环化反应中的作用，突出其通过脱氢烷烃形成芳香烃的潜力。

包含钒氧化物的催化剂在将丙烷转化为芳香烃的活性和选择性方面表现出显著优势，与仅含H-ZSM-5的催化剂相比。然而，镓在这些过程中的作用与Pt和Zn有所不同。镓氧化物在聚合烯烃方面没有表现活性，而是对n-己烯表现出高反应性，主要生成环烯烃和芳香烃，其中苯是主要产物。n-己烯和1,5-己二烯在镓氧化物上的转化速率明显高于丙烷或环己烷脱氢化，表明存在更高效的转化途径。n-己烯转化过程中未检测到环己烷的存在，而1,5-己二烯转化过程中未形成环己烯（环己烯选择性为1%），这表明在镓氧化物上直接进行环闭合机制不可能成为脱氢环化的主要机制。相反，过程可能涉及双烯和三烯作为中间体的形成，在至少形成双烯之后才发生最终环闭合，这意味着环己烷不可能是n-己烯在镓氧化物上脱氢环化过程中的中间体。从研究中得出结论，对于n-己烯和1,5-己二烯而言，以及可能对于其他烷烃而言，通过脱氢烷烃产生双烯和三烯，然后快速在气相反应中进行热环闭合，形成了芳香烃的形成方式。
