[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."
[2] "The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction conditions is directly related to the catalytic performance."
[3] "Vanadia catalysts are usually reduced to some extent during redox reactions, and the reduced vanadia species have been proposed as the active sites."
[4] "Information on the valence state and molecular structure of the reduced vanadia catalysts is of great interest."
[5] "A number of techniques have been applied to investigate the reduction of supported vanadia catalysts, such as TPR, XPS, ESR, UV-Vis DRS, XAFS, and Raman spectroscopy."
[6] "Most Raman studies of supported VOx catalysts were carried out using a single excitation wavelength in the visible region."
[7] "Several recent investigations on supported transition metal oxides, including vanadium oxides, using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths."
[8] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2."
[9] "The vanadia densities of the catalysts were 1.1 V/nm2 for the sample with the 1% loading, 3.7 V/nm2 for the 3.5% loading and 10.4 V/nm2 for the 8% loading."
[10] "Only the XRD pattern for the catalyst with the 8% loading exhibited additional characteristic peaks of crystalline V2O5 at 2θ values 26.3 and 34.6."
[11] "The same trend in mass loss is observed during Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) studies of catalyst reduction."
[12] "This would suggest a change of 2 in the vanadium oxidation state, so if the vanadium were in a +5 oxidation state before reduction it would be converted to +3 after reduction."
[13] "Using oxygen chemisorption at 293 K and 873 K the average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina was calculated as 3.8, whereas the average oxidation state for the 3.5% VOx/alumina was calculated as 2.6."
[14] "The ease of replacing oxygen that had been removed during reduction was 8% > 3.5% > 1%."
[15] "The 3.5%V sample did not regain its original state even after high temperature oxidation; however, the reduced 8%V sample did convert to a species that was similar to the original oxidation state."
[16] "V/θ-Al2O3 samples (0.03 V, 1.2 V, 4.4 V, and 14.2 V) were tested for butane dehydrogenation under low partial pressures of butane at 873 K, and the activity and selectivity data on these different catalysts were compared."
[17] "At temperatures below 673 K, a weak Raman band at 1620 cm−1, assigned to C=C stretching in polyalkenes, is observed together with the two bands at 1021 and 915 cm−1 due to the V=O and V-O-Al modes of surface VOx species, respectively."
[18] "The band at 1500 cm−1 is usually assigned to conjugated polyalkenes or cyclopentadienyl species."
[19] "The band at 1438 cm−1 is due to the bending mode of CH3/CH2 or CH in aromatic rings."
[20] "The two sharp bands at 1004 and 845 cm−1 are rarely reported for coke species, and thus one might ascribe them to surface VOx species."
[21] "As the dehydrogenation temperature is increased to 873 K, the intensity of the Raman bands below 1500 cm−1 decreases significantly."
[22] "Raman spectra obtained after the reaction of butane with pre-reduced 1.2 %V (not shown) are very similar to those on pre-oxidized 1.2 %V."
[23] "It is interesting to find out that 1,3-butadiene adsorption at room temperature results in similar spectra to that from butane dehydrogenation on 1.2 V at 673 K."
[24] "Comparison of spectrum c to that reported for polystyrene confirms the identity of spectrum c: the set of Raman bands near 850, 1002, 1183, 1437, 1501, and 1603 cm−1 is due to polystyrene."
[25] "Further Raman spectroscopy study of styrene on V/θ-Al2O3 samples heated to 873 K showed that the characteristic Raman bands of polystyrene disappear, owing to its decomposition."
[26] "Microanalysis of a used 1.2 V catalyst for carbon and hydrogen gave a C:H value of 0.9 as per polystyrene monomer in agreement with the Raman spectra."
[27] "One important general characteristic of coke is its topology, which can be assessed by the intensity ratio of the band at around 1600 cm−1 (G band) to the band at around 1400 cm−1 (D band)."
[28] "The coke species are more 2-D, sheet-like from butane dehydrogenation on V/θ-Al2O3 with high surface VOx density (>1.2 V/nm2) while more 1-D-like on V/θ-Al2O3 with lower surface VOx density (<1.2 V/nm2)."
[29] "After regeneration, the surface area of an 8%V catalyst was reduced by 50%, a change assigned to transformations in the nature of the support."
[30] "27 Al triple-quantum (3Q) MAS NMR studies have also demonstrated that the nature of the support undergoes a transformation."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more selective and stable catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on understanding the structure-function relationships of vanadium oxide catalysts. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

2. The deactivation of vanadia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, has been well known. The regeneration of catalysts is periodic and involves oxidation. The designs of commercial reactors for this process vary in managing deactivation and regeneration, with specific interest in the Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN process technology.

3. In the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the chromia catalysts are known for their ability to convert propane to propene. The CATOFIN process technology, currently owned by Sd-Chemie and licensed by ABB Lummus, involves a series of fixed-bed reactors that operate on a cyclic basis. The process includes steps for regeneration, evacuation, and reduction to maintain catalyst activity.

4. The use of vanadia catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation presents a rich and complex chemistry, with ongoing research aimed at understanding the structure-function relationships.

5. The dehydrogenation of butane on vanadia/alumina catalysts has shown a dependence on the structure of the catalyst. Research has established a structure-coke relationship, where both the nature and amount of coke formed during the dehydrogenation process depend on the structure of the vanadia/alumina catalysts. This relationship has been investigated through a combination of reactivity, UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM, and UV Raman studies.
