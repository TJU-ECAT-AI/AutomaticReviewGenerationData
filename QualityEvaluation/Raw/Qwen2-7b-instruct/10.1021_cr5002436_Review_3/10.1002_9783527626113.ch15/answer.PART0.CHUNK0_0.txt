[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."
[2] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm 2 ; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2

[3] "The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction conditions is directly related to the catalytic performance. Vanadia catalysts are usually reduced to some extent during redox reactions, and the reduced vanadia species have been proposed as the active sites."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to develop more selective and stable catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the complex chemistry involved. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Studies have shown that the structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction conditions directly impacts their catalytic performance. Typically, vanadia catalysts are reduced during redox reactions, with the reduced vanadia species considered active sites. Techniques like Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), Ultraviolet-Visible Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS), and Raman spectroscopy have been utilized to investigate the reduction of supported vanadia catalysts. Reduction of these catalysts occurs over a range of temperatures, and the onset is influenced by the weight loading, with complete reduction achieved up to 873 K. Regeneration processes, particularly via oxidation, have been studied to restore the catalysts' performance, with UV Raman spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography (GC) providing insights into the catalyst's structure and behavior during regeneration.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究，是出于开发更选择性和稳定的催化剂的需要。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，对其中涉及的复杂化学性质有了更深入的理解。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量在影响这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为方面起着关键作用。研究表明，支持范德华催化剂在还原反应条件下的结构直接决定了它们的催化性能。通常，在还原反应过程中，范德华催化剂会被还原，还原的范德华物种被视为活性位点。使用了诸如温度程序化减少（TPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、电子自旋共振（ESR）、紫外-可见漫反射光谱（UV-Vis DRS）、X射线吸收精细结构光谱（XAFS）和拉曼光谱等技术来研究支持范德华催化剂的还原过程。这些催化剂的还原发生在一系列温度下，且其起始点受负载量的影响，完全还原可达到873 K。通过氧化过程进行的再生过程也已被研究，以恢复催化剂的性能，其中，紫外拉曼光谱和气相色谱（GC）提供了关于催化剂结构和再生过程行为的见解。
