[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."
[2] "The situation with butane is similar but with significant differences. The formation of coke on the surface is very similar to that found with propane; however, Edussuriya and coworkers (unpublished results) found that although the majority of the catalyst deactivation was due to polynuclear aromatics or other forms of coke strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates were also detected."
[3] "The regeneration of samples of V/ θ - Al 2
O
3 coked from low partial pressure butane dehydrogenation via oxidation was also followed by UV Raman spectros- copy as well as gas chromatography (GC)."
[4] "It is rare for a structure-function relationship to be shown unambiguously in heterogeneous catalysis. However, a structure-coke relationship has been established in the dehydrogenation of butane on VO
x

O
3 catalysts by combined reactivity, UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM and UV Raman investigations."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the complex chemistry of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species. For instance, the structure of the catalyst affects the amount and nature of coke formed during dehydrogenation. Studies have shown that the majority of catalyst deactivation is due to polynuclear aromatics or other forms of coke, along with strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates. The regeneration of coked vanadia/alumina catalysts via oxidation has been followed by techniques like UV Raman spectroscopy, providing insights into the restoration of catalyst structure. A structure-function relationship has been established, demonstrating the impact of catalyst structure on the formation and behavior of coke during dehydrogenation.

对于帕拉芬脱氢，使用Pt和CrOx催化剂的替代品，如钒氧化物催化剂的研究，主要是出于寻找成本更低、环境更友好的催化剂的需求。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，对这些催化剂中钒物种的复杂化学性质有了更深入的理解。载体类型、支撑面积大小和金属负载等变量在影响钒物种的性质和行为方面起着关键作用。例如，催化剂的结构会影响脱氢过程中形成的焦炭量和性质。研究表明，催化剂失活的主要原因是聚核芳烃或其它形式的焦炭，以及强烈吸附的反应中间体。通过氧化还原、紫外-可见DRS、NMR、TEOM和紫外光谱等技术，已经观察到被低分压丁烷脱氢焦化的钒/θ-Al2O3催化剂的再生过程，提供了催化剂结构恢复的信息。已经建立了结构-功能关系，表明催化剂结构对脱氢过程中焦炭的形成和行为有直接影响。
