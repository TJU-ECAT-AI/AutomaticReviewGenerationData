[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."
[2] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."
[3] "Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates."
[4] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
[5] "Hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1.Modifications of zeolites with zinc ions enhance the catalytic activity for ethane, propane, and propene aromatization.
2.On catalysts with zinc, the rate of propene formation exceeds the rate of propene hydrogenation.
3.Zinc ions boost both alkane dehydrogenation and alkene conversion rates.
4.Zinc increases the rates of alkane aromatization by accelerating hydrogen removal.
5.Despite zinc's influence, hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps remain irreversible on zinc-modified zeolites.
