          [1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."
          [2] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."
          [3] "Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates."
          [4] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
          [5] "Hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts."
          [6] "Reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 lead primarily to undesired products of β-scission reactions."
          [7] "Turnover rates, aro- matic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during alkane conversion increase as the density of exchanged Zn cations increases in H-ZSM5."
          [8] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles,leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aro- matic products."
          [9] "Zn species increase the rate of propane dehydrogenation (r1); therefore, they must also catalyze the reverse reaction: propene hydrogenation (r1)."
          [10] "Relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and conversion to other products (r2) (Scheme 2) can be measured from the rate of isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene and from the isotopic content of the other reaction products."

          The modification of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc cations leads to increased turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization. The ratio of propene aromatization to propene hydrogenation rates is higher on catalysts containing zinc compared to H-ZSM5, despite zinc increasing the rate of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps. Zinc cations not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes but also accelerate the conversion of alkenes. Zinc cations enhance the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of hydrogen recombination desorption from the activation of C-H bonds.

          通过交换锌离子修改五元环沸石，可以提高乙烷、丙烷和丙烯芳构化过程中的转化率、芳香基时间产率以及氢气的处理速度。在含锌样品中，丙烯芳构化速率与丙烯氢化速率的比值高于H-ZSM5，尽管锌离子加快了脱氢和氢化步骤。锌离子不仅催化烷烃脱氢，还加速了烯烃的转化。锌离子通过增加C-H键激活过程中生成的氢原子的再组合脱附速率，提高了烷烃的芳构化速率。

          The modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc cations lead to enhanced turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during the aromatization of ethane, propane, and propene. Zinc cations not only facilitate the dehydrogenation of alkanes (r1) but also accelerate the conversion of alkenes. The zinc cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization through the acceleration of hydrogen recombination desorption from the C-H activation steps.
