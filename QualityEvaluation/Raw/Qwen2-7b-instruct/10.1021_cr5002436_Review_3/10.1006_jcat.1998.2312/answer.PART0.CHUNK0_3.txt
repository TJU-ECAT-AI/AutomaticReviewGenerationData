1. The reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 mainly produce unwanted β-scission products. Increasing the density of exchanged Zn cations in H-ZSM5 enhances the turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during alkane conversion.

2. Zn cations reduce β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles, resulting in higher rates and selectivity for synthesizing C6-C8 aromatic products.

3. Zn cations increase the rate of propane dehydrogenation (r1), which also catalyzes the reverse reaction: propene hydrogenation (r1).

4. The relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and conversion to other products (r2) can be measured using the rate of isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene, along with the isotopic content of other reaction products.

5. The (r2/r1) ratios on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts are higher than on H-ZSM5, being about 2 on H-ZSM5 and 6 on Zn/H-ZSM5.

6. As the pressure of gas phase hydrogen increases, the propane conversion turnover rates and aromatic selectivities decrease on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts due to the influence of hydrogen adsorption and desorption sites provided by Zn cations.

7. The presence of Zn species enables gas phase hydrogen to dissociatively adsorb and effectively compete for surface sites, thereby reducing aromatic selectivity.

8. Ambient gas phase hydrogen pressures are much lower than the virtual surface concentration on H-ZSM5. As ambient H2 pressures rise, the surface of Zn/H-ZSM5 also becomes hydrogen-rich, leading to increasingly saturated surface intermediates and products resembling those on hydrogen-rich H-ZSM5 surfaces.

1. 在H-ZSM5上，乙烷和丙烷的主要反应产物是不希望得到的β裂解产物。通过在H-ZSM5中增加交换锌离子的密度，可以提高烷烃转化的周转率、芳香族位点时间产率以及氢气排放速率。

2. 锌离子减少了β裂解速率和烯烃在寡聚化/β裂解循环中的停留时间，导致C6-C8芳香族产品的更高合成速率和选择性。

3. 锌离子增加了丙烷的脱氢速率（r1），同时也催化了反向反应：丙烯的氢化（r1）。

4. 可以通过丙烷-2-13C和未标记丙烯之间的同位素扰动速率以及其他反应产物的同位素含量来测量丙烯脱氢速率（r1）与转化为其他产品的速率（r2）的比例。

5. Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上的(r2/r1)比率高于H-ZSM5，分别为H-ZSM5上的2和Zn/H-ZSM5上的6。

6. 随着气体相氢气压力的增加，Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上的丙烷转化周转率和芳香族选择性会降低，因为氢吸附和脱吸附站点由Zn离子提供。

7. 存在Zn物种使气体相氢气能够离解吸附并有效地竞争表面站点，从而降低芳香族选择性。

8. 环境气体相氢气压力远低于H-ZSM5的虚拟表面浓度。随着环境H2压力的升高，Zn/H-ZSM5表面也变得富含氢，导致表面中间体和产品逐渐饱和，类似于氢丰富的H-ZSM5表面。
