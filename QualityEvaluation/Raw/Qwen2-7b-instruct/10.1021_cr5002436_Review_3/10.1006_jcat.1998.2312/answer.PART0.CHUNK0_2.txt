1.Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations enhance the efficiency of ethane, propane, and propene aromatization processes by increasing turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates.
2.Hydrogen desorption site-yields on H-ZSM5 increase with the addition of Zn cations.
3.Propane conversion rates and product distribution on H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 are similar at comparable conversion levels.
4.Zn cations are known to reside at cation exchange sites within Zn/H-ZSM5 materials.
5.Increasing Zn content in H-ZSM5 catalysts leads to an increase in deuterium content within unreacted propane.
6.Propane aromatization rates and selectivities are unaffected by hydrogen gas pressure on H-ZSM5, as reported in other studies.
7.Introduction of Zn cations into H-ZSM5 catalysts accelerates the isotopic equilibration process.
8.Raising hydrogen gas pressure decreases propane conversion rates and aromatic selectivities on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts.
9.Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations boost the efficiency of ethane, propane, and propene aromatization.
10.The ratio of propene aromatization rates to propene hydrogenation rates is higher on Zn-added samples compared to H-ZSM5, despite Zn increasing dehydrogenation rates.
