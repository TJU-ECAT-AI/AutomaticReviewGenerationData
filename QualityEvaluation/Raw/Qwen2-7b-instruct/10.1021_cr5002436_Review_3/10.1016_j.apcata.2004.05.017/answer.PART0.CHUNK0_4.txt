[1] "While sup- ported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial pro- cesses [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Important drawbacks still exist with the implementation of this catalytic reaction. First, alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and it requires relatively high tem- peratures and low pressures to yields significant fractions of alkenes."

[3] "Experiments are developed at 520 C in a fixed bed microreactor."

[4] "The superior performance of the VOx/USY catalyst is assigned to its mild acidity."

[5] "Considering the very large surface available in the USY support only partial sur- face coverage is achieved."

[6] "Even more, given the relatively high catalytic dehydrogenation activity observed a high concentration of VOx exposed active sites can be hypothesized."

[7] "Since the n-butane conversion increases during the first few min- utes of reaction, one could envisage that a pre-reduction prior to catalyst exposure to n-butane (a common treatment for both Pt and Cr2O3 supported on alumina catalyst) could as well increase the initial conversion."

[8] "The VOx/USY catalysts provided a high 60-75% alkene selectivity. This selectivity, was higher than the one for the VOx/-Al2O3, with this selectivity difference being assigned to the mild VOx/USY acidity."

[9] "The VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst, TPR results show highly dispersed vanadia on the alumina surface, with no evidence of V2O5 crystallites formation."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation processes started in the 1980s. Research in this field has evolved significantly, focusing on catalysts' performance under oxygen-free atmospheres. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The implementation of alkane dehydrogenation faces challenges due to the endothermic nature of the process. It necessitates high temperatures and low pressures to achieve significant alkenes production. This process often leads to thermal cracking and coke formation, affecting catalyst efficiency.

3. The experiments were conducted at a temperature of 520°C in a fixed bed microreactor, demonstrating the effectiveness of using vanadium oxide catalysts under these conditions.

4. The VOx/USY catalyst exhibits superior performance, attributed to its mild acidity. The USY support's acidity influences the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

5. The USY support's large surface area only partially covers the vanadium species, affecting the catalyst's overall performance.

6. The high concentration of exposed vanadium active sites is hypothesized to contribute to the high catalytic activity observed in the VOx/USY catalyst.

7. Pre-reduction of the catalyst before exposure to n-butane might increase the initial conversion rate, potentially enhancing the catalyst's performance.

8. The VOx/USY catalyst provides a high alkene selectivity, around 60-75%, surpassing that of the VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst. This difference in selectivity is attributed to the milder acidity of the VOx/USY catalyst.

9. The TPR results for the VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst show highly dispersed vanadia on the alumina surface, lacking evidence of V2O5 crystallites formation, which impacts the catalyst's performance.

1. 针对烷烃脱氢反应，从1980年代开始探索使用含钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品。这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，专注于在无氧气氛下的催化剂性能。载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素影响钒物种在这些催化剂中的性质和行为。

2. 烷烃脱氢过程面临的挑战在于其吸热性质，需要较高温度和较低压力以实现显著的烯烃产率。这个过程往往伴随着热裂解和焦炭形成，影响催化剂的效率。

3. 实验在520°C的固定床微反应器中进行，表明使用含钒氧化物催化剂在这些条件下是有效的。

4. VOx/USY催化剂表现出优异的性能，归因于其温和的酸性。USY支持的酸性影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

5. USY支持的大表面积仅部分覆盖了钒物种，影响催化剂的整体性能。

6. 假设高暴露的钒活性位点浓度是观察到的高催化活性在VOx/USY催化剂中出现的原因。

7. 在催化剂暴露于n-丁烷之前进行预还原可能增加初始转化率，从而提高催化剂的性能。

8. VOx/USY催化剂提供了约60-75%的高烯烃选择性，超过VOx/-Al2O3催化剂的选择性。这种选择性的差异归因于VOx/USY催化剂的较温和酸性。

9. TPR结果表明，VOx/-Al2O3催化剂上分散的钒主要分布在氧化铝表面，没有发现V2O5结晶体的存在，这影响了催化剂的性能。
