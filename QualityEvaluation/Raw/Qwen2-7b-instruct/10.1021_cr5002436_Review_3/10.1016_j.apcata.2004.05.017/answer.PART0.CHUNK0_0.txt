[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in oxygen free atmospheres is a valuable approach to produce alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "Important drawbacks still exist with the implementation of this catalytic reaction."
[3] "While sup- ported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [3-6]."
[4] "Dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and it requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to yields significant fractions of alkenes."
[5] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."
[6] "It thus appears as if the surface in this catalyst is subjected, after a given time-on-stream, to a much slower activity losses, still displaying under these conditions a favorable performance towards the reactions leading to olefin formation."
[7] "These findings show higher coke levels on the VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst and are in agreement with the catalytic test results, which indicate that cracking reactions and catalyst decay are more dominant over VOx/-Al2O3 than over VOx/USY."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. Since the 1980s, researchers have focused on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Vanadium oxide catalysts offer potential benefits due to their ability to produce alkenes from inexpensive saturated hydrocarbons. However, the reaction is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures, which can lead to thermal cracking and catalyst deactivation. The nature of the oxide carrier significantly affects the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts. The VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst experiences faster activity loss and higher coke formation compared to the VOx/USY catalyst, indicating that USY supports may offer better performance under dehydrogenation conditions.

对铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)用于烷烃脱氢的低成本且环保的替代品的探索，推动了钒氧化物基催化剂的研究。自1980年代以来，研究人员集中于理解载体类型、支持表面积以及金属负载如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。钒氧化物催化剂通过从廉价饱和烃原料产生烯烃提供了一种潜在的选择。然而，该反应是吸热的，并需要高温和低压以产生显著比例的烯烃。催化剂活性的快速损耗和焦炭形成表明，与VOx/-Al2O3催化剂相比，USY支持可能在脱氢条件下提供更好的性能。
