[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in oxygen free atmospheres is a valuable approach to produce alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "Only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts."
[3] "The purpose of this work is to determine the activity and selectivity of supported vanadium on four different materials: γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, USY (ultrastable HY), and NaY zeolite."
[4] "Both γ-alumina and USY zeolite are solid acids."
[5] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acid-base properties are studied here."
[6] "Characterization of these catalysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)."
[7] "The superior performance of the VOx/USY catalyst is assigned to its mild acidity."
[8] "The vanadium content for the various prepared catalysts is reported in Table 1."
[9] "It was noticed that the specific surface area of the support was unaffected upon the introduction of VOx for both γ and δ alumina."
[10] "In contrast with this, a strong decrease of the specific surface area was observed for the USY supported catalyst, with the BET area being reduced by nearly 50% after vanadium impregnation."
[11] "The TPR profile of VOx/USY (profile c in Fig. 1) displays distinctive trends of those corresponding to VOx supported on γ and δ alumina."
[12] "Three peaks were now noticed, with maximum temperature peaks placed at 580, 670 and 780 C, respectively, and a shoulder at 460 C."
[13] "The 460 C shoulder is attributed to the reduction of isolated VOx species, while 580, 670 and 780 C peaks are assigned to a three step crystalline V2O5 reduction."
[14] "In order to interpret these TPR profiles the following has to be considered: (a) a vanadia monolayer over USY is quite unlikely to be present, given the acid character of the zeolite support, (b) VOV bond formation is not viable and VOx chains or a VOx monolayer are not expected to develop."
[15] "The USY zeolite sample displayed one single peak at 271 C."
[16] "This peak was assigned to both Brnsted and Lewis low-strength acid sites."
[17] "Upon addition of VOx on the USY support, the TPD peak strongly decreases."
[18] "Considering the very large surface available in the USY support only partial surface coverage is achieved."
[19] "Another interesting observation relates to the shifting of TPD peak from 271 to 240 C for USY and VOx/USY, respectively."
[20] "It is very likely this shift is the result of the VOx own acidity, with the acidity measured via TPD being the combined contribution of the support and of VOx species."
[21] "The USY zeolite sample dis-played one single peak at 271 C."
[22] "This peak was assigned to both Brnsted and Lewis low-strength acid sites."
[23] "Upon addition of VOx on the USY support, the TPD peak strongly decreases."
[24] "While describing this effect it is important to consider that V loadings in the zeolite are quite low (6.3%)."
[25] "Considering the very large surface available in the USY support only partial surface coverage is achieved."
[26] "Thus, it is possible to argue that the VOx addition reduces the acidity of the zeolite and this is likely to be due to the V2O5 crystallite phase formation,which blocks zeolite windows and supercages and strongly hinders NH3 accessibility."
[27] "The TPO profiles in the subsequent second oxidation cycle (black lines in Fig. 9) showed a main peak."
[28] "With these positive peaks representing O2 consumption of an 5% O2/95% He mixture."
[29] "A maximum peak at 130 C was observed for VOx/-Al2O3."
[30] "This early peak was assigned to the VOx1 species re-oxidation."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the desire for cost-effective and efficient methods of producing alkenes from inexpensive hydrocarbon feedstocks. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the development of catalysts that can operate under oxygen-free atmospheres. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The nature of the support material, whether γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, USY (ultrastable HY), or NaY zeolite, affects the dispersion and stability of vanadium species. Different supports lead to the formation of various vanadium species, including monomeric or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites.

3. The use of vanadium oxide catalysts in n-butane dehydrogenation under oxygen-free atmospheres relies on the interplay between redox and acid-base properties. Catalysts are characterized using techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD).

4. γ-Alumina and USY zeolite are characterized as solid acids, which can lead to unwanted cracking and coking reactions when used as supports for alkane dehydrogenation. In contrast, non-acidic γ-Al2O3 and NaY zeolite might offer better performance by minimizing secondary reactions.

5. The mild acidity of the VOx/USY catalyst is attributed to its ability to maintain a balance between alkane dehydrogenation and the formation of desired alkenes, making it the most active and selective catalyst among the tested samples.

6. The vanadium content in the prepared catalysts varies across the different materials, influencing their catalytic activity and selectivity. Partial surface coverage on the supports ensures the dispersion of vanadium species, affecting their reactivity and stability.

7. The specific surface area of the support is generally unaffected by the addition of VOx for γ and δ alumina. However, it significantly decreases for the USY-supported catalyst, likely due to the formation of V2O5 crystallites, which block zeolite windows and supercages, hindering ammonia accessibility.

8. The TPD peak shifts from 271 to 240°C upon the addition of VOx to the USY support, indicating the combined contribution of the support and VOx species to the overall acidity. This shift suggests that the VOx addition reduces the acidity of the zeolite, possibly due to the formation of V2O5 crystallites.

9. The TPO profiles for the VOx/USY catalyst show transformations through oxidation-reduction cycles, with peaks becoming less defined over time. This indicates that the three-dimensional oxide species are unable to remain unaffected under regeneration conditions, suggesting the formation of V2O5 crystallites.

10. The selectivity of alkene formation during the catalytic activity of the VOx/USY catalyst is higher compared to other tested catalysts, attributed to its mild acidity that facilitates the formation of active sites promoting butene production.

11. The TPO profiles for the VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrate highly dispersed vanadia on the alumina surface, lacking evidence of V2O5 crystallite formation. The addition of VOx appears to reduce support acidity, contributing to the catalyst's activity and selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation.

12. The TPO profiles for the VOxM/-Al2O3 catalyst suggest the formation of a vanadium overlayer, which significantly contributes to the low activity of this catalyst.

13. The results highlight the significance of moderating butane and butenes catalytic cracking activity in the designed catalysts, aiming to minimize undesirable cracking reactions and enhance the selectivity towards desired olefin products.

14. The best catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation in an oxygen-free atmosphere, as suggested by the study, should feature a highly dispersed reduced VOx phase on a slightly acidic support, balancing reactivity and selectivity.

1. 探索以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品，用于正构烷烃脱氢生成乙烯的方法，是基于低成本饱和烃原料高效生产烯烃的需求。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究不断发展，重点在于开发能够在无氧气氛下进行反应的催化剂。载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等变量对催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为有显著影响。

2. 支持材料的不同，如γ-Al2O3、δ-Al2O3、USY（超稳定的HY）或NaY沸石，会影响范德华物种的分布和稳定性。不同的支持会导致不同类型的范德华物种形成，包括单体或二聚范德酸盐、VOx链、范德亚层或V2O5晶粒。

3. 在n-丁烷脱氢过程中使用氧自由气氛下的范德华氧化物催化剂依赖于还原性和酸碱性质之间的相互作用。催化剂通过温度程序化还原（TPR）、温度程序化氧化（TPO）和氨温度程序化脱附（NH3-TPD）等技术进行表征。

4. γ-Alumina和USY沸石被描述为固体酸，可能导致不希望的裂解和焦炭形成反应，当它们用作烷基脱氢的支撑时。相比之下，非酸性的γ-Al2O3和NaY沸石可能提供更好的性能，通过最小化副反应。

5. VOx/USY催化剂的温和酸性被归因于其在烷基脱氢与生成所需烯烃之间保持平衡的能力，这使得它是测试样品中最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂。

6. 准备催化剂时的钒含量在不同材料之间变化，影响其催化活性和选择性。支持物上的部分表面覆盖确保了钒物种的分散，影响其反应性和稳定性。

7. γ和δ铝酸盐的特定表面面积通常不受VOx添加的影响。然而，对于USY支持的催化剂，它显著减少，这可能是由于V2O5晶粒的形成，它们阻止了沸石窗口和超笼，严重阻碍了氨的可及性。

8. 加入VOx到USY支持的TPD峰从271°C移动到240°C，表明支持物和VOx物种对整体酸性的贡献。这种移动表明，VOx的添加减少了沸石的酸性，这可能是由于V2O5晶粒的形成。

9. VOx/-Al2O3催化剂的TPO轮廓显示了氧化还原周期中的变化，峰值变得不太明确。这表明三维氧化物物种无法在再生条件下保持不变，暗示形成了V2O5晶粒。

10. 为了实现最佳的n-丁烷脱氢性能，设计的催化剂应该包含高度分散的还原VOx相在略带酸性的支持上，平衡反应性和选择性。

11. 结果强调了调节但烷和但烯催化裂解活动的重要性，在设计的催化剂中，旨在最小化不希望的裂解反应并增强目标烯烃产物的选择性。

12. 最好的催化剂，作为本研究的建议，在氧气自由气氛下的n-丁烷脱氢，应该具有高度分散的还原VOx相在稍微酸性的支持上，平衡活性和选择性。
