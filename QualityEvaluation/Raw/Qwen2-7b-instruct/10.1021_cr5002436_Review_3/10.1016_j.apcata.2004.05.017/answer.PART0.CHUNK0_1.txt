[1] "Important drawbacks still exist with the implementation of this catalytic reaction. First, alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and it requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to yields significant fractions of alkenes."
[2] "While sup- ported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."
[3] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acid-base properties are studied here. Characterization of these cata- lysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)."
[4] "It was noticed that the amount of supported V on -Al2O3 in- creased for the sample prepared via the NH4VO3 precursor."
[5] "In this respect, it is important to mention that, vanadium oxides are known fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts poisons, with vanadium oxide species destroying the Brn- sted acid sites and the structure of the ultrastable zeolite USY [7]."
[6] "The vanadium pentoxide crystallites formed are specific species of the VOx/USY catalyst, and this leads to a num- ber of effects such as blocking of windows and supercages,reduction of specific surface area and TPD acidity modifi- cations."
[7] "The VOx/USY catalysts provided a high 60-75% alkene selectivity. This selectivity, was higher than the one for the VOx/-Al2O3, with this selectivity difference being assigned to the mild VOx/USY acidity."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation gained traction due to their potential economic benefits and environmental advantages. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst composition and structure to enhance activity and selectivity. Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, the use of aluminum oxide (-Al2O3) and USY zeolite as supports affects the dispersion of vanadium species and, consequently, the catalyst's activity and selectivity toward alkene production. The USY zeolite's strong acidity facilitates the formation of a more dispersed and reduced vanadium phase compared to alumina, leading to improved selectivity for alkenes. Additionally, the preparation method, such as the use of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) instead of vanadium acetylacetonate (V(AcAc)3), influences the amount of supported vanadium and the resulting catalyst performance. The presence of vanadium oxide species, especially V2O5 crystallites, on the USY support modifies the surface properties, such as blocking windows and supercages, reducing specific surface area, and altering acidity, which in turn impacts the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert paraffins into alkenes with minimal side reactions.

对于烷烃脱氢反应，铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）通常用作催化剂。然而，研究发现，使用钒基催化剂作为替代品具有经济优势和环境优势。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究发展迅速，重点是优化催化剂的组成和结构以提高活性和选择性。影响钒物种性质的因素包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载。例如，使用氧化铝（-Al2O3）和USY沸石作为支持体会影响钒物种的分散性和催化剂的活性和烯烃生成选择性。USY沸石的强酸性有助于形成更分散且还原的钒相，从而提高了烯烃的选择性。此外，制备方法，如使用氨水合钒酸盐（NH4VO3）而非乙酰丙酮三价钒（V(AcAc)3），影响支持的量和最终催化剂性能。在USY支持上存在的钒氧化物物种，尤其是V2O5晶粒，改变了表面特性，如堵塞窗口和超笼，减少了特定表面积，并改变了酸度，这进而影响催化剂有效转化烷烃为烯烃的能力，同时尽量减少副反应。
