[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in oxygen free atmospheres is a valuable approach to produce alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons."
[2] "While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [3-6]."
[3] "Dehydration reactions are endothermic, and they require relatively high temperatures and low pressures to yield significant fractions of alkenes."
[4] "Under these conditions, thermal cracking to lighter alkanes and coke formation are also promoted with the alkane transformation being quite unselective given all CH and CC bonds display close reactivity."
[5] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acid-base properties are studied here."
[6] "In this context, the purpose of this work is to determine the activity and selectivity of supported vanadium on four different materials: γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3, USY (ultrastable HY), and NaY zeolite."
[7] "Both γ-alumina and USY zeolite are solid acids. It is thus expected that alkane dehydrogenation using these supports will be accompanied with undesired cracking and coking leading to significant catalyst deactivation."
[8] "In contrast, the use of non-acidic γ-alumina and NaY zeolite may be valuable given the potential minimization of unwanted secondary reactions."
[9] "The superior performance of the VOx/USY catalyst is assigned to its mild acidity."
[10] "Catalytic runs were preceded with a number of blank runs. During these blank runs, the support only was loaded in the reactor. No measurable n-butane conversion was observed at the catalytic reaction conditions, for both γ-Al2O3 or α-Al2O3."
[11] "Concerning the reaction experiments, n-butane conversions on VOx/USY, VOx/-Al2O3, and VOxM/-Al2O3 catalysts are reported in Fig. 6."
[12] "The VOx/-Al2O3 displayed however, a very limited n-butane conversion, even though a relatively high concentration of VOx species is present on this catalyst, and its acidity is higher than the acidity of the VOx/USY (refer to Table 2)."
[13] "This behavior can be assigned to the formation of a vanadia overlayer on the α-Al2O3 support with the expected result of a low fraction of V-species exposed, leading overall to a low concentration of V-active sites."
[14] "The %S increased consistently (refer to Fig. 7) for both the VOx/USY, from 55 to 75% and for the VOx/-Al2O3, from 45 to 60%."
[15] "These differences in the butene selectivity were ascribed to the acidity differences between these two catalysts, a dominant property determining butane dehydrogenation into butenes."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation is driven by the need for cost-effective and efficient methods to produce alkenes from low-cost hydrocarbons. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly impact the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion and stability of vanadium species. Support surface area influences the interaction of vanadium with the support, potentially affecting the acidity of the support and the formation of vanadium oxides. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium sites available for catalytic reactions.

3. The nature of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by the carrier type, leading to different behaviors in terms of activity and selectivity. For instance, the VOx/USY catalyst provides a high alkene selectivity, while VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts exhibit lower selectivity. This difference is attributed to the mild acidity of VOx/USY, which favors the formation of butenes.

4. The use of γ-alumina and USY zeolite as carriers leads to different vanadium species compared to γ-alumina and α-Al2O3. γ-alumina and USY zeolite are solid acids, promoting cracking and coking reactions, whereas γ-alumina and NaY zeolite might minimize unwanted secondary reactions.

5. The formation of a vanadia overlayer on the α-Al2O3 support results in limited n-butane conversion due to a low concentration of active vanadium sites exposed. This contrasts with the VOx/USY catalyst, which exhibits better performance and selectivity for n-butane dehydrogenation.

1. 对于从低成本饱和烃中制备烯烃的烷烃脱氢，使用钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品的探索，旨在实现成本效益高且高效的生产工艺。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展，重点在于理解载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的影响。

2. 载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量显著影响钒氧化物催化剂的性能。载体类型影响了钒物种的分散性和稳定性。支持表面面积影响了钒与支持的相互作用，可能影响支持的酸性以及钒氧化物的形成。金属负载决定了活性钒位点的浓度，从而影响催化反应。

3. 这些催化剂中钒物种的性质受到载体类型的影响，在不同性能和选择性方面表现出不同的行为。例如，VOx/USY催化剂提供了高烷基选择性，而VOx/-Al2O3催化剂的选择性较低。这种差异归因于VOx/USY的温和酸性，这有利于但烯的形成。

4. 使用γ-Al2O3和USY沸石作为载体与γ-Al2O3和α-Al2O3相比，导致不同的钒物种。γ-Al2O3和USY沸石是固体酸，促进裂解和结焦反应，而γ-Al2O3和NaY沸石可能会减少不希望的副反应。

5. 在α-Al2O3载体上形成的钒过层导致有限的n-丁烷转化，因为暴露的活性钒位点浓度低。相比之下，VOx/USY催化剂在n-丁烷脱氢方面表现出更好的性能和选择性。
