[1] "In the late 1980s, the search for alternatives to precious metals like Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation was intense, driven by the high cost and scarcity of these materials. Research in this area has evolved significantly since then, focusing on developing efficient, cost-effective catalysts."
[2] "The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors, including the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading."
[3] "Carrier type plays a crucial role in determining the stability and activity of vanadium-based catalysts. Different carriers can affect the dispersion of vanadium species and thus impact the catalyst's performance."
[4] "Support surface area impacts the availability of active sites for reaction. A larger surface area typically leads to more active sites, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency."
[5] "Metal loading affects the concentration of vanadium species on the catalyst surface. Optimal loading ensures a balance between the number of active sites and the stability of the catalyst."
