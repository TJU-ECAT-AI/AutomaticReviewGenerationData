1. In the 1980s, vanadium oxide-based catalysts started to be considered as alternatives to precious metals such as platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation. Research since then has aimed at understanding the structure and reactivity of vanadium species within these catalysts, particularly in relation to factors influencing their performance. The nature of these vanadium species can be impacted by the selection of carrier material, support surface area, and metal loading.

2. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have been demonstrated to significantly affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The type of carrier can influence how vanadium species are dispersed on the support, impacting their availability and reactivity. The surface area of the support determines the concentration of vanadium species, which in turn influences the overall catalytic efficiency. The amount of metal loaded in the catalyst, represented by metal loading, can potentially change its reactivity and selectivity.
