[1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."
[2] "The higher surface density of surface vanadia species increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites [104]."
[3] "Furthermore, the reactivity per site, the TOE for the surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions is generally significantly greater than the corresponding TOF over supported molybdena and chromia catalysts [103,104]."

Research into vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. These catalysts have gained widespread commercial application for oxidation reactions such as the selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3, and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR. The surface density of vanadium oxide species is typically higher than in other supported metal oxide catalysts, which increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites. Additionally, the reactivity per site for vanadium oxide catalysts is generally significantly greater than that of supported molybdenum and chromium oxide catalysts.

自1980年代以来，对以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷基化脱氢的研究取得了显著进展。这些催化剂在选择性氧化邻二甲苯到邻苯二甲酸酐、烷基芳香族化合物的氨氧化、选择性催化还原NOx使用NH3以及控制SO2氧化到SO3期间的SCR等氧化反应中获得了广泛应用。范德华氧化物物种的表面密度通常高于其他支持金属氧化物催化剂，这增加了催化活性位点的数量，并且减少了暴露于氧化物支撑位点上的副反应。此外，范德华氧化物催化剂的单位位点活性通常明显大于支持钼和铬氧化物催化剂。
