[1] "Today, research in this area is strongly motivated by the need to optimize resources and to shorten the number of steps, hence the direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products is therefore of major interest."

[2] "However, finding stable catalytic systems using acceptable operating conditions remains a challenge."

[3] "Any of these processes will have first to rely on the selective CH bond activation."

[8] "The CH bond activation of alkyl fragments can also occur during the chemisorption of organometallic compounds on alumina (grafting)."

[9] "While grafting typically takes place via reaction of the surface hydroxyls with the reactive MC bond..."

[10] "In the specific case of the conversion of ethane into ethene, it is even competitive with steam cracking."

[11] "The optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[12] "Reoxidation of VIII or VIV species is always easy with O2."

[13] "The terminal oxo species of VV surface species are the most reactive O sites according to DFT calculations on a model for isolated silica supported vanadyl species."

[14] "Calculations also suggest that the formation of propene in the propane dehydrogenation is most favored via subsequent H-abstraction of the propyl radical on an adjacent isolated VO species."

[15] "Note however that other grafting pathways have been encountered; for example, grafting of Mo and W alkylidene complexes usually takes place via the direct electrophilic cleavage of σ-bonded ligands."

[16] "The α-H abstraction process has also been observed upon the thermal treatment of bis(alkyl) surface species [(SiO)2M(CH2R)2] (M = Ti, Zr, and Cr; Scheme 20d), which yields [(SiO)2M(CHR)]."

[17] "One of the key steps involves an intramolecular CH bond activation process, α-H transfer, to transform the bis-alkylidene into an alkyl alkylidyne fragment."

[18] "For instance, the Cyclar and related processes (aroforming or Z-forming) typically use Ga-zeolite to convert in a single step liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of propane and butane, into H2 and liquid aromatics, i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylenes."

[19] "The most likely mechanism for propane dehydrogenation into propene on Ga2O3 takes place via H-transfer on O sites and a concomitant reduction of surface Ga-centers."

[20] "As already pointed out, metalalkyl intermediates have been observed (87) but could only correspond to dormant species of the overall catalytic cycle."

[21] "The thus-generated alkyl radical generates via H-transfer the alkene and GaIIIH. This intermediate can then decompose into H2 to regenerate the initial surface sites (GaIII)."

[22] "Note that the competitive formation/desorption of H2O leads to a modification of the reduction of Ga sites (GaI)."

[23] "While the dehydrogenation of alkanes on Ga2O3 is promising, rapid deactivation is still a major problem."

[24] "Improved stabilities have been obtained by using solid solution in alumina (83) or by using supported systems."

[25] "Of several studies on the H/D exchange reaction of D2/alkane mixtures on various Zn-zeolites, (20, 200-202) a recent comparative study of H- and Zn-zeolite (zeolite = BEA) shows that Zn-BEA displays a much lower activation energy and higher rates (ca. 2 orders of magnitude) than the corresponding H-zeolite, (201)"
