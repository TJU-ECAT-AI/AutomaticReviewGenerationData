[1] "The most notable example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process."
[2] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[3] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
[5] "For instance, the silica supported zirconium hydrides (218-222) react with a wide range of alkanes, e.g., CH4, CnH2n+2, and cycloalkanes, at low temperatures to yield the corresponding metal alkyl complexes and H2, (223) as observed with analogous molecular d0 complexes (Scheme 15a). (224)"
[6] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
[7] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[8] "In the case of silica supported tantalum hydrides, but the observed selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution are very different (Table 3 and Scheme 25a)."
[9] "Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."
[10] "However, while silica or silicaalumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl do not display any catalytic activity in alkane metathesis under standard conditions (150 C and ca. 1 bar), they catalytically convert propane into higher and lower homologues under supercritical conditions (Table 4, entries 1718). (317)"
[11] "Moreover, it has been shown that cofeeding CO2 typically increases both the activity and the stability of these nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalysts; possibly because CO2 plays the role of a mild oxidant and prevents coke formation."

1. The direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion) is a commercial process, utilizing vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst.

2. Vanadium phosphate (VPO) is also used to selectively convert o-xylene into phtalic anhydride.

3. The rate determining step in the butane conversion process is the activation of the CH bond.

4. The key challenge in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is the ease and speed of alkene oxidation compared to alkane oxidation.

5. Silica supported zirconium hydrides react with a wide range of alkanes at low temperatures to yield metal alkyl complexes and H2, similar to analogous molecular d0 complexes.

6. Various cyclic alkanes undergo hydrogenolysis with the silica supported tantalum hydrides catalyst, albeit with lower rates and turnovers.

7. The two-site mechanism involving tantalum hydrides is proposed for alkane metathesis, with one site generating an alkene and the other evolving towards a Ta-alkylidene hydride.
