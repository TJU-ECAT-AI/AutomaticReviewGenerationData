[1] "The most notable example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process."
[2] "One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."
[3] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (ODH) is also another important reaction. (98) One of the key problems is that the oxidation of the alkene product is often easier (faster) than that of the starting alkane."
[5] "For instance, the silica supported zirconium hydrides (218-222) react with a wide range of alkanes, e.g., CH4, CnH2n+2, and cycloalkanes, at low temperatures to yield the corresponding metal alkyl complexes and H2, (223) as observed with analogous molecular d0 complexes (Scheme 15a). (224)"
[6] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."
[7] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."
[8] "In the case of silica supported tantalum hydrides, but the observed selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution are very different (Table 3 and Scheme 25a)."
[9] "Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes (Table 4 and Scheme 27d): Tantalum hydrides prepared on various oxide supports: silicaalumina, alumina, and tailored made supports (entries 14), (262, 310) but they display similar activities and selectivities with the original silica supported tantalum hydrides."
[10] "However, while silica or silicaalumina supported zirconium hydrides or alkyl do not display any catalytic activity in alkane metathesis under standard conditions (150 C and ca. 1 bar), they catalytically convert propane into higher and lower homologues under supercritical conditions (Table 4, entries 1718). (317)"
[11] "Moreover, it has been shown that cofeeding CO2 typically increases both the activity and the stability of these nonoxidative dehydrogenation catalysts; possibly because CO2 plays the role of a mild oxidant and prevents coke formation."

Research in the field of chemical activation of alkanes is primarily driven by the need to optimize resources and reduce the number of production steps. The direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products holds significant interest. However, establishing stable catalytic systems with acceptable operational conditions remains a challenge. In heterogeneous catalysis, the selective activation of CH bonds in alkanes facilitates the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step. This trend is consistent with the activity of these oxides in hydrogenation processes. Supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, such as VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx, are notable catalysts in this context. The direct removal of H2 from the intermediate species is less favored. In the case of methane, the formation of TaCH3, TaCH2, and TaCH species is observed. The precise structure and nature of the active sites in metal-exchange zeolites remain a subject of debate. The selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond represents the selective process in the oxidation of benzene. Metalalkyl intermediates have indeed been reported in certain processes.

[1] "Despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx)."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane are promising processes."
[3] "In the specific case of the conversion of ethane into ethene, it is even competitive with steam cracking."
[4] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
[5] "The optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective, stable, and selective catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on optimizing the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance the performance of vanadium species in these catalysts. 

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several variables. The choice of carrier type affects the dispersion and stability of vanadium oxides, impacting their reactivity. A larger support surface area can provide more active sites, potentially increasing the catalyst's efficiency. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium species, which is crucial for achieving optimal activity and selectivity. 

Specifically, in the context of ethane dehydrogenation into ethene, supported vanadium oxides have shown promise, often being competitive with steam cracking processes. This is attributed to the active sites possibly involving isolated vanadium oxide (VO) species, distinct from those found in molybdenum oxide (MoOx) or tungsten oxide (WOx) systems. The optimal operational conditions for this process are challenging, requiring precise control over temperature to balance between efficient dehydrogenation and the avoidance of overoxidation and unselective reactions.

对于烷烃脱氢反应，探索以钒氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品，主要是出于对成本效益、稳定性和选择性催化剂的需求。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，专注于优化载体类型、支持物表面积以及金属负载，以提高钒物种在这些催化剂中的性能。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质与行为的因素包括多个变量。载体类型的选取影响了钒氧化物的分散性和稳定性，进而影响其活性。更大的支持物表面积可以提供更多的活性位点，可能提高催化剂的效率。金属负载决定了钒物种的浓度，这对于实现最佳活性和选择性至关重要。

具体来说，在将乙烷转化为乙烯的背景下，支持的钒氧化物显示出希望，有时甚至与蒸汽裂解过程相竞争。这归因于活性位点可能涉及孤立的钒氧化物（VO）物种，与钼氧化物（MoOx）或钨氧化物（WOx）系统中的不同。此过程的最佳操作条件具有挑战性，需要精确控制温度以平衡高效的脱氢作用和避免过氧化和非选择性反应。
