Research in the field of chemical activation of alkanes is primarily driven by the need to optimize resources and reduce the number of production steps. The direct and selective transformation of petrochemicals into valuable products holds significant interest. However, establishing stable catalytic systems with acceptable operational conditions remains a challenge. In heterogeneous catalysis, the selective activation of CH bonds in alkanes facilitates the synthesis of more valuable and functionalized products in a single step. This trend is consistent with the activity of these oxides in hydrogenation processes. Supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, such as VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx, are notable catalysts in this context. The direct removal of H2 from the intermediate species is less favored. In the case of methane, the formation of TaCH3, TaCH2, and TaCH species is observed. The precise structure and nature of the active sites in metal-exchange zeolites remain a subject of debate. The selective functionalization of an aromatic CH bond represents the selective process in the oxidation of benzene. Metalalkyl intermediates have indeed been reported in certain processes.
