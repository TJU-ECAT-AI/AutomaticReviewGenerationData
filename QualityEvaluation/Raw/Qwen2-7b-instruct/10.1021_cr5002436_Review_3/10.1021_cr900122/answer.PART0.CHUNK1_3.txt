The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been motivated by the pursuit of more economical, durable, and selective catalytic systems. Research in this field has advanced considerably since the 1980s, leading to a deeper understanding of the properties and behaviors of vanadium species within these catalysts. Factors such as the choice of carrier material, support surface area, and metal loading concentration are critical in influencing the performance, efficiency, and longevity of vanadium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.
