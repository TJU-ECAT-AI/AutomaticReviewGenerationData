1. Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation started in the 1980s. The focus has been on studying the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, leading to the formation of alkenes and water. The initial activity of vanadium oxide catalysts, both modified and unmodified with Mg and Zr, was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure.

2. The dehydrogenation activity was highest after carbon monoxide (CO) reduction, and the selectivity towards i-butene increased while the formation of coke decreased with the addition of magnesium.

3. The aim of the research was to investigate the impact of Mg and Zr as promoters on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

4. Activity measurements were conducted at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor.

5. The products were analyzed online using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer.

6. The conversion and selectivities were calculated based on the carbon balance.

7. The vanadium and promoter contents of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts are listed in Table 1.

8. The XRD pattern of the V5 catalyst indicated typical reflections for the alumina support.

9. The presence of Mg vanadates could not be ruled out due to the possibility of their crystal size being below the detection limit.

10. The crystalline size of the catalysts was calculated from the half-width of the diffraction peak from γ-alumina using the Scherrer equation.

11. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were comparable to the BET surface area of the alumina support treated under identical conditions.

12. The ESR spectra of the sample V5 were presented in Figure 6.

13. Species A and B were characterized by specific ESR parameters. Species A was dominant after calcination, while species B was more present after CO reduction.

14. The content of V4+ relative to the total V content was similar after calcination and hydrogen reduction for the three catalysts.

15. The amounts of V4+ were very similar after calcination and reduction with CO for the three catalysts under study.
