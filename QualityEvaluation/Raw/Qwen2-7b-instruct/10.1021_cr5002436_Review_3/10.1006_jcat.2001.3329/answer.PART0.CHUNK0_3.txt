[1] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."
[2] "The catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 was investigated after pretreatment with H2, CH4, and CO, and the highest activity was obtained after CO reduction."
[3] "According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,electron spin resonance, temperature programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, during CO reduction, V3+ species and two kinds of V4+ species with different coordinations (A and B) were formed on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation during the first minutes on butane stream with calcined catalysts was also affected by the acidity of the catalyst."
[5] "The activity of supported vanadium oxide, with and without a promotor, was studied here as a function of reaction time and the catalyst pretreatment."
[6] "It is likely that the differences in activities induced by the promotors were due to the acidities of the catalysts, which had an influence on the side reactions of cracking, skeletal isomerization, and coke formation."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s with advancements in understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Research has demonstrated that supported vanadium oxide catalysts are active in dehydrogenating alkanes in the absence of oxygen, producing alkenes and hydrogen as primary products. After pretreatment with H2, CH4, and CO, the highest activity is achieved through CO reduction. Studies employing techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements have revealed that during CO reduction, V3+ species and two types of V4+ species with varying coordinations (A and B) are formed on the catalyst surface. The acidity of the catalyst, influenced by factors such as carrier type and support surface area, plays a crucial role in affecting side reactions including cracking, skeletal isomerization, and coke formation, thereby impacting the overall catalytic performance and selectivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts.

自1980年代以来，对以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的探索已经取得了进展。随着对载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载对范德华物种性质和行为影响的理解加深，研究已经证明，支持的范德华氧化物催化剂在无氧条件下能够催化烷烃脱氢，主要产物为烯烃和氢气。在经过H2、CH4和CO预处理后，CO还原可以获得最高活性。通过使用X射线光电子能谱、电子自旋共振、温度程序化还原和傅里叶变换红外光谱等技术进行的研究表明，在CO还原过程中，催化剂表面上形成了V3+物种以及两种不同配位的V4+物种（A型和B型）。催化剂的酸性，受载体类型和支持表面面积等因素的影响，对裂解、骨架异构化和焦炭形成等副反应有着关键作用，进而影响范德华氧化物催化剂的整体催化性能和选择性。
