1. Researchers have explored vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for the dehydrogenation of paraffins, due to their potential for high efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This area of research has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the role of metal promoters, carrier materials, and surface chemistry in determining catalyst activity and selectivity.

2. Variables such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, alumina has been commonly used as a support due to its high surface area and stability. The surface area of the support can affect the dispersion of vanadium oxide particles, influencing the availability of active sites. Metal loading refers to the amount of vanadium relative to the support, which can impact the redox properties and the ability of the catalyst to undergo various transformations. Metal promoters like magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) can alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, affecting its activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure. The activity was evaluated after reduction with hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), and varied depending on the amount of promoter added.

4. The dehydrogenation activity was found to be highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity towards i-butene increased with the addition of magnesium. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of vanadium species with different coordination environments during CO reduction.

5. Both vanadium species, V4+ (A) and V3+, were found to be active in the dehydrogenation process, with the activity of V4+ (A) considered higher than that of V3+. The activity of the catalysts with and without promoters was studied as a function of reaction time and pretreatment.

6. The activity measurements were conducted at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor, utilizing a Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer for product analysis and a gas chromatograph for hydrocarbon analysis.

7. The hydrocarbons formed during the dehydrogenation were analyzed using a gas chromatograph after 10 minutes on stream, while the FTIR gas analyzer was used continuously for online analysis. The carbon balance did not account for the coke formed on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation.

8. Some of the catalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts were heated to 580-585°C under 5% oxygen flow, and some were then reduced with hydrogen or carbon monoxide for 30 minutes before XPS analysis.

1. 研究人员已经探索了以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品的可能性，用于烷烃的脱氢反应，原因在于其高效性和成本效益。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，包括对促进剂、载体材料和表面化学在决定催化剂活性和选择性方面作用的理解。

2. 载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量影响了这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，氧化铝由于其高表面积和稳定性常被用作支撑材料。支撑材料的表面积可以影响钒氧化物颗粒的分散，从而影响活性位点的可用性。金属负载是指相对于支撑材料的钒含量，它会影响催化剂的还原性质及其在脱氢反应中的各种转化能力。镁（Mg）和锆（Zr）这样的金属促进剂可以改变催化剂的电子性质，从而影响其活性和选择性。

3. 在580°C下，在大气压力下对含有和不含镁和锆的氧化铝支持的五氧化二钒催化剂进行了脱氢化异丁烷和正丁烷的研究。活动性在氢气（H2）和一氧化碳（CO）还原后，根据促进剂的量进行评估。

4. CO还原后的脱氢化活性最高，添加镁后i-己烯的选择性增加。X射线光电子光谱、电子自旋共振、温度程序化还原和傅里叶变换红外测量揭示了CO还原过程中催化剂表面上具有不同配位环境的钒物种的形成。

5. 在脱氢化过程中，两种钒物种，V4+（A）和V3+，都被发现是活性的，其中V4+（A）被认为比V3+更活跃。含有和不含有促进剂的催化剂的活动性随着反应时间和预处理的变化而变化进行了研究。

6. 活性测量在580°C下在固定床微反应器中进行，在此条件下进行了大气压力下的脱氢化反应，并使用傅里叶变换红外气体分析仪对产品进行了分析，使用气相色谱法对烃类化合物进行了在线分析。
