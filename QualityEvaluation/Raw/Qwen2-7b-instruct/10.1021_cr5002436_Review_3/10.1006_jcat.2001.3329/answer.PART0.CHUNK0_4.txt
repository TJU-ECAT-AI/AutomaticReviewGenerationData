[1] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."
[2] "In the absence of oxygen, the oxidative atmosphere is not present, and the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 was investigated after pretreatment with H2, CH4, and CO, and the highest activity was obtained after CO reduction."
[3] "The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide cata- lysts with and without Mg and Zr was studied in the dehydrogena- tion of butanes."
[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of pro- motors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of sup- ported vanadium oxide."
[5] "Alkane molecules react with oxygen atoms and the reduced vanadium cations that are formed are reoxidized in the oxidative atmosphere."
[6] "Vanadium was mainly reduced to V3+ with H2, and only a small amount of V4+ (B) was measured by ESR."
[7] "A larger amount of V4+ (co- ordinations A and B) and some V3+ were formed during CO reduction."
[8] "The highest activity in dehydrogenation of butanes to butenes and H2 was obtained after reduction of the catalysts with CO."
[9] "The average oxidation state of vanadium obtained with H2 was slightly lower than obtained with CO."
[10] "Selectivities for the side reactions of cracking, skeletal isomerization, and coke formation were noticeably different for the V5Zr5 and V5Mg5 catalysts,and the differences were attributed to the acidities of the catalysts."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation began in the 1980s. Research in this area has evolved by focusing on catalyst characterization through XPS, ESR, TPR, and FTIR. Variables influencing vanadium species include carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by the reduction process. The highest activity in dehydrogenation of butanes was observed after reduction with CO, suggesting that both V4+ and V3+ were active species, with V4+ (A) having higher activity. Modifying the catalyst with Mg causes a decrease in activity while increasing selectivity for dehydrogenation. Zr modification causes little change in activity. The differences in activities are attributed to the acidities of the catalysts affecting side reactions like cracking, skeletal isomerization, and coke formation.

范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究始于1980年代。这一领域的研究发展集中在通过XPS、ESR、TPR和FTIR对催化剂进行表征。影响范德华物种的因素包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载。这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为受还原过程的影响。在使用CO还原后观察到的最高活性表明，无论是V4+还是V3+都可能是活性物种，其中V4+（A）具有更高的活性。通过镁改性催化剂会导致活性下降，同时提高脱氢选择性。锆改性催化剂对活性影响不大。催化剂活性的不同归因于酸性差异，这种差异影响裂解、骨架异构化和焦炭形成等副反应。
