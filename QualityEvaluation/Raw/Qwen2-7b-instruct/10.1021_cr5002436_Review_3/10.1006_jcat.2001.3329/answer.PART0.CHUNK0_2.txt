[1] "The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide cata- lysts with and without Mg and Zr was studied in the dehydrogena- tion of i-butane and n-butane at 580C under atmospheric pres- sure."
[2] "The dehydrogenation activity was highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased and the formation of coke decreased with the addition of Mg."
[3] "According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,electron spin resonance,temperature programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, during CO reduction, V3+ species and two kinds of V4+ species with different coordina- tions (A and B) were formed on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of pro- motors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of sup- ported vanadium oxide."
[5] "High activity of the alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts was obtained in the dehydrogenation of bu- tanes to butenes and hydrogen. Activity was best with the CO-reduced catalyst, either unmodified or modified with Zr."
[6] "It is clear that the active phase was formed during the CO reduction. The vanadium species then present were V4+ (A and B) and V3+."
[7] "The ESR and XPS studies also revealed that the oxida- tion state of the catalyst after reduction with H2 or CO at 580C was not different when the catalyst was modified with Mg and Zr."
[8] "The main side reaction with the i-butane feed was the for- mation of n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene, that is, the skeletal isomerization of the formed i-butene (and subsequent de- hydrogenation of n-butenes)."
[9] "With the n-butane feed, the selectivity for isomerization was lower."
[10] "The higher acidity of the reduced catalysts might then be due to the alumina support."

1. The research explored vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, evolving from studies in the 1980s. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. Research has shown that adding Mg to vanadium oxide catalysts decreases their activity but increases selectivity for dehydrogenation. Zr modification does not significantly alter activity.

3. After reduction with CO, vanadium species include V4+ (A and B) and V3+. After H2 reduction, vanadium is predominantly reduced to V3+ with only a small amount of V4+ (B).

4. Mg addition causes a decrease in catalyst activity while improving selectivity for dehydrogenation.

5. The activity of the catalysts was highest after CO reduction, whether unmodified or modified with Zr. 

6. Both V4+ and V3+ species are active in the dehydrogenation process, with V4+ (A) having a higher activity.

7. The oxidation state of vanadium after reduction with H2 or CO at 580°C is similar when the catalyst is modified with Mg and Zr.

8. The main side reaction with the i-butane feed is skeletal isomerization of i-butene, forming n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene.

9. The selectivity for isomerization is lower when using n-butane feed.

10. The higher acidity of the catalysts, which influences the selectivity for skeletal isomerization, can be attributed to the alumina support.

1. 对帕拉芬脱氢反应，研究探索了以氧化钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品，从20世纪80年代的研究发展而来。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。

2. 研究表明，在催化剂中添加Mg会降低活性但提高脱氢选择性。Zr修饰对活性的影响不大。

3. 在CO还原后，钒物种包括V4+(A和B)和V3+。在H2还原后，主要将钒还原为V3+，只有少量的V4+(B)。

4. Mg的添加导致催化剂活性下降，但提高了脱氢的选择性。

5. 不论是否修饰，CO还原后的催化剂具有最高的活性。

6. 在脱氢过程中，无论是V4+(A)还是V3+都表现出活性，其中V4+(A)的活性较高。

7. 当催化剂通过Mg和Zr修饰时，在580°C下用H2或CO还原后，催化剂的氧化状态相似。

8. 使用i丁烷喂料的主要副反应是i丁烯的骨化，形成n丁烯和1,3-丁二烯。

9. 使用n丁烷喂料时，异构化的选择性较低。

10. 影响异构化选择性的催化剂的较高酸性可以归因于氧化铝支撑。
