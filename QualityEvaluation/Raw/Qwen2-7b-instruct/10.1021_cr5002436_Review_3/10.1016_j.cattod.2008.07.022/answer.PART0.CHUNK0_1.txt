1. The dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is crucial for producing alkenes and alkadienes, which serve as essential precursors for fuels, plastics, and other materials. A significant portion of research has concentrated on vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for ODH reactions.
   
2. The surface species on supported catalysts have been found to play distinct roles in the reaction mechanisms. Understanding these roles helps in correlating the catalytic activity and selectivity with the surface properties of VOx species.

3. The vanadium loading and the BET surface area of the catalysts are tabulated. As vanadium loading increases, the surface area decreases, ranging from 104 m²/g for 1 wt.% to 77 m²/g for 8 wt.%.

4. Monomeric vanadate species are dominant on catalyst surfaces with low vanadium loadings (1 wt.%). As the vanadia concentration rises, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the major vanadia components, accounting for 60% and 10% of the total vanadium on the surface of 3.5 wt.% catalysts, respectively.

5. 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy has been employed on the catalysts and the pure support. The peaks in the spectra provide information about the coordination environment of aluminum in the catalyst and the support.

6. The peak at 6 ppm is indicative of aluminum in a sixfold, octahedral coordination. The downfield region could suggest the presence of aluminum in pentafold or tetrahedral coordination.

7. Changes in the vanadium-oxygen stretching region of infrared spectra after regeneration indicate that peaks at higher wavenumbers are diminished while those at lower wavenumbers are amplified. The spectrum of the regenerated catalyst is characterized by a prominent band at 1005 cm⁻¹.

1. 轻烷烃的脱氢和氧化脱氢（ODH）是形成烯烃和二烯烃的重要途径，这些化合物是燃料、塑料和其他材料的重要前体。大量的研究集中在VOx催化剂上，用于ODH反应。

2. 支持催化剂上的表面物种在反应机制中扮演着不同的角色。了解这些作用有助于将催化活性和选择性与VOx物种的表面性质联系起来。

3. 表列出的催化剂的钒加载量和BET表面积。随着钒加载量的增加，表面积下降，从1 wt.%的104 m²/g到8 wt.%的77 m²/g。

4. 在低钒加载量（1 wt.%）的情况下，单核范德酸盐物种在催化剂表面上占主导地位。随着钒浓度的增加，聚范德酸盐和结晶V2O5成为主要的范德酸物种，分别占3.5 wt.%催化剂表面总钒的60%和10%。

5. 对催化剂和纯支持进行了27Al MAS NMR光谱分析。光谱中的峰值提供了关于催化剂和支撑物中铝的配位环境的信息。

6. 峰在6 ppm处表明六面体八面体配位的铝。下段区域可能表示五面体或四面体配位的铝。

7. 再生后，红外光谱中在较高波数的峰减少而在较低波数的峰增加，再生催化剂的光谱特征由1005 cm⁻¹的明显带主导。
