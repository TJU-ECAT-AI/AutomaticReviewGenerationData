[1] "Such reactions are believed to proceed via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which reduced VOx centres that form during reaction are reoxidised by gas-phase oxygen."
[2] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials."
[3] "Despite this,there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts."
[4] "Catalytic activity data were acquired using a fixed-bed reactor connected to an on-line GC (Agilent 6890)."
[5] "In this work we attempt to redress this through characterisation of a series of u-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts at all stages during the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen: as-prepared, calcined, reduced, post-reaction and post- regeneration."
[6] "From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction."
[7] "For comparison the surface area of the pure support material is 106 m2 g1."
[8] "It was shown that monomeric vanadate species are predominant on the surface of catalysts with vanadium loadings 1 wt.%. As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V."
[9] "The formation of AlVO4 through the interaction of VOx species and alumina under oxidising conditions at the temperatures employed herein is well known."
[10] "Despite the apparent reduction of V5+ to V3+, previous UVvis DRS studies have clearly demonstrated the presence of partially reduced V4+ species after reduction in H2."
[11] "The principle reason for these low values is the high selectivities to retained carbon."
[12] "It is clear that 8 V reoxidises at faster rate than either 1 V or 3.5 V; the initial rate of reoxidation being 0.2 s1, as compared to 0.1 s1 for 1 V and 3.5 V."

1. The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism is believed to govern the dehydrogenation process, involving reoxidation of reduced VOx centers by gas-phase oxygen.
2. Light alkanes' conversion to alkenes and alkadienes through dehydrogenation is a key process in the production of fuels, plastics, and other materials.
3. There is a need to understand the specific roles of various surface species in supported catalysts.
4. Catalytic activity measurements were performed using a fixed-bed reactor and online GC.
5. The study aimed to characterize a series of u-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts at various stages during the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane without gas-phase oxygen.
6. Polymeric vanadia clusters favor the formation of butenes and butadienes, whereas more isolated species are effective in producing polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface post-reaction.
7. The pure support material's surface area was 106 m2/g.
8. Monomeric vanadate species dominate on catalyst surfaces with low vanadium loadings, while polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become dominant at higher loadings.
