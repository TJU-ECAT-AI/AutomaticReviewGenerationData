The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation began in the 1980s, focusing on the synthesis of alkenes and alkadienes, crucial precursors for fuels, plastics, and various materials. Research in this area has evolved significantly since then, particularly in understanding the role of different surface species on supported catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Surface area, for instance, affects the dispersion of vanadium species, impacting catalytic activity and selectivity. Higher metal loadings lead to larger vanadium domains and more V2O5 formation. Calcination influences the structure of supported vanadate units, with AlVO4 formation noted at higher loadings. Reducing conditions transform V5+ to V3+, and regeneration results in the formation of highly crystalline V5+ species. Lower reaction temperatures reduce the magnitude of structural changes, and regeneration leads to a shift in the nature of vanadium species, affecting catalytic behavior.

Regeneration processes can lead to the restoration of catalytic activity by converting more crystalline species back to polymeric ones, enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. However, polyolefinic coke species removed during high-temperature regeneration are not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation, which instead is attributed to tightly bound reaction intermediates that can be removed under mild conditions.

探索以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品用于烷烃脱氢，始于20世纪80年代，专注于形成烯烃和二烯烃，这些是燃料、塑料和其他材料的关键前体。自那时以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，特别是在理解支持催化剂上的不同表面物种的作用。载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量显著影响范德华物种在这些催化剂中的性质和行为。例如，表面积影响了范德华物种的分散，从而影响催化活性和选择性。更高的金属负载导致更大的范德华域和更多的V2O5形成。煅烧影响了支持范德酸盐单元的结构，在较高负载下观察到AlVO4的形成。还原条件将V5+转变为V3+，而再生则形成了高度结晶的V5+物种。较低反应温度减少了结构变化的幅度，并且再生过程导致了范德华物种性质的变化，影响了催化行为。

再生过程可以通过将更结晶的物种转换回聚合物状态来恢复催化活性，从而增强脱氢选择性。然而，在高温下去除的聚烯烃焦油物种不是催化剂失活的主要原因，而是紧密附着的反应中间体，可以在温和条件下从表面去除。

1. The dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is crucial for producing alkenes and alkadienes, which serve as essential precursors for fuels, plastics, and other materials. A significant portion of research has concentrated on vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for ODH reactions.
   
2. The surface species on supported catalysts have been found to play distinct roles in the reaction mechanisms. Understanding these roles helps in correlating the catalytic activity and selectivity with the surface properties of VOx species.

3. The vanadium loading and the BET surface area of the catalysts are tabulated. As vanadium loading increases, the surface area decreases, ranging from 104 m²/g for 1 wt.% to 77 m²/g for 8 wt.%.

4. Monomeric vanadate species are dominant on catalyst surfaces with low vanadium loadings (1 wt.%). As the vanadia concentration rises, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the major vanadia components, accounting for 60% and 10% of the total vanadium on the surface of 3.5 wt.% catalysts, respectively.

5. 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy has been employed on the catalysts and the pure support. The peaks in the spectra provide information about the coordination environment of aluminum in the catalyst and the support.

6. The peak at 6 ppm is indicative of aluminum in a sixfold, octahedral coordination. The downfield region could suggest the presence of aluminum in pentafold or tetrahedral coordination.

7. Changes in the vanadium-oxygen stretching region of infrared spectra after regeneration indicate that peaks at higher wavenumbers are diminished while those at lower wavenumbers are amplified. The spectrum of the regenerated catalyst is characterized by a prominent band at 1005 cm⁻¹.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has increasingly focused on supported vanadium oxides (VOx) for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, aiming to understand and optimize the role of different surface species on the catalysts. The structure of supported VOx units in catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the distinct roles of various surface species on supported catalysts. The characterization of catalysts at various stages—before preparation, after calcination, post-reduction, post-reaction, and post-regeneration—has been carried out using solid-state NMR (51V MAS NMR, 27Al MAS NMR, and 27Al 3Q-MAS NMR), FT-IR spectroscopies, Raman spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. This enables researchers to establish correlations between the surface properties of VOx species and the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The research suggests that polymeric vanadia clusters promote the formation of butenes and butadienes, whereas more isolated species are highly effective in the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. However, these polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and potentially more sustainable catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with studies focusing on understanding the unique properties and behaviors of vanadium species within these catalysts. Variables such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and effectiveness of vanadium species. These factors influence the catalyst's ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions efficiently while maintaining selectivity towards the desired products. The literature indicates that isolated vanadia species show high activity but with low selectivity, primarily due to the formation of coke. On the other hand, polymeric vanadates display a greater selectivity towards desired C4 dehydrogenation products. Treatment with oxygen at high temperatures can facilitate the formation of polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like surface species, thereby increasing catalytic activity. After regeneration, the nature of the catalyst changes due to transformations affecting both surface vanadium species and the pure support. Vanadium appears to catalyze a phase transformation in alumina above 823 K. High-temperature regeneration removes polyolefinic coke species, but it is not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Instead, tightly bound reaction intermediates are responsible for the majority of catalyst deactivation, which can be removed under mild conditions.

The structure-activity relationships between the surface species of supported vanadium oxide catalysts and their catalytic behavior towards n-butane dehydrogenation have been elucidated through a series of analytical techniques. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how to optimize the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索，主要受到低成本、环境友好和潜在更可持续催化剂的需求驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于理解这些催化剂中范德华物种的独特性质和行为。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量在决定范德华物种的性质和有效性方面起着关键作用。这些因素影响催化剂促进脱氢反应的效率及其对目标产品的选择性。文献表明，孤立的范德华物种表现出高活性但选择性低，主要原因是形成焦炭。另一方面，聚合型范酸盐显示出对预期的C4脱氢产物具有更高的选择性。通过氧在高温下的处理，可以促进从V2O5类似表面物种形成聚合型范酸盐，从而提高催化活性。再生后，催化剂的性质会因影响表面范德华物种和纯支持的变化而改变。范德华似乎在823 K以上催化铝酸盐发生相变。高温再生去除聚烯烃焦炭物种，但不是催化剂失活的主要原因。相反，紧密吸附的反应中间体是大多数催化剂失活的原因，可以在温和条件下去除。

通过一系列分析技术对支持的范德华氧化物催化剂表面物种与脱氢反应催化行为之间的结构-活性关系进行了阐述。这些发现有助于更好地理解如何优化范德华氧化物催化剂的性能。
