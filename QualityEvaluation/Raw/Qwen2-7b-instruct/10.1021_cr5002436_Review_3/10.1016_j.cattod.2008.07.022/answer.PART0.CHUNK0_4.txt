[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials."
[2] "In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."
[3] "Despite this,there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts."
[4] "In this work we attempt to redress this through characterisation of a series of u-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts at all stages during the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen: as-prepared, calcined, reduced, post-reaction and post- regeneration."
[5] "Catalytic activity data were acquired using a fixed-bed reactor connected to an on-line GC (Agilent 6890)."
[6] "A series of u-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts, of different vanadium loadings, have been characterised and employed for the selective dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[7] "From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction."
[8] "In TEOM studies the reduced catalysts were reoxidised using 100% O2 (50 cm3 min1, 0.1 barg) at 723 K."
[9] "It is clear from Table 4 that reoxidation does not replace 100% of the oxygen removed during reduction, with lower loading catalysts taking up less oxygen, e.g. 1 V replaces 71% of the lost oxygen compared to 83% for 8 V."
[10] "The spectrum of the regenerated catalyst (in this case 8 V) differs from that of the as-prepared catalyst."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and potentially more sustainable catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with studies focusing on understanding the unique properties and behaviors of vanadium species within these catalysts. Variables such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and effectiveness of vanadium species. These factors influence the catalyst's ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions efficiently while maintaining selectivity towards the desired products. The literature indicates that isolated vanadia species show high activity but with low selectivity, primarily due to the formation of coke. On the other hand, polymeric vanadates display a greater selectivity towards desired C4 dehydrogenation products. Treatment with oxygen at high temperatures can facilitate the formation of polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like surface species, thereby increasing catalytic activity. After regeneration, the nature of the catalyst changes due to transformations affecting both surface vanadium species and the pure support. Vanadium appears to catalyze a phase transformation in alumina above 823 K. High-temperature regeneration removes polyolefinic coke species, but it is not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Instead, tightly bound reaction intermediates are responsible for the majority of catalyst deactivation, which can be removed under mild conditions.

The structure-activity relationships between the surface species of supported vanadium oxide catalysts and their catalytic behavior towards n-butane dehydrogenation have been elucidated through a series of analytical techniques. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how to optimize the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索，主要受到低成本、环境友好和潜在更可持续催化剂的需求驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于理解这些催化剂中范德华物种的独特性质和行为。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量在决定范德华物种的性质和有效性方面起着关键作用。这些因素影响催化剂促进脱氢反应的效率及其对目标产品的选择性。文献表明，孤立的范德华物种表现出高活性但选择性低，主要原因是形成焦炭。另一方面，聚合型范酸盐显示出对预期的C4脱氢产物具有更高的选择性。通过氧在高温下的处理，可以促进从V2O5类似表面物种形成聚合型范酸盐，从而提高催化活性。再生后，催化剂的性质会因影响表面范德华物种和纯支持的变化而改变。范德华似乎在823 K以上催化铝酸盐发生相变。高温再生去除聚烯烃焦炭物种，但不是催化剂失活的主要原因。相反，紧密吸附的反应中间体是大多数催化剂失活的原因，可以在温和条件下去除。

通过一系列分析技术对支持的范德华氧化物催化剂表面物种与脱氢反应催化行为之间的结构-活性关系进行了阐述。这些发现有助于更好地理解如何优化范德华氧化物催化剂的性能。
