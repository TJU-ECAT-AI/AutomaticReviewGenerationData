[1] "In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."
[2] "Despite this,there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played by the different surface species present on supported catalysts."
[3] "These data are then related to catalytic activity measurements providing insights into the relationship between surface VOx species and catalytic activity and selectivity."
[4] "For comparison the surface area of the pure support material is 106 m2 g1."
[5] "It was shown that monomeric vanadate species are predominant on the surface of catalysts with vanadium loadings 1 wt.%. As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V."
[6] "This may be due to the dispersion of such species during the calcination procedure."
[7] "The overall trend of reduction is seen to be towards the formation of V3+."
[8] "At lower reaction temperatures, such as 823 K (the temperature employed in catalytic activity studies, Section 3.4) these changes either do not occur or are much less pronounced."
[9] "That this was due to a change in the nature of the VOx species after regeneration was confirmed by UVvis spectroscopy studies."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation began in the 1980s, focusing on the synthesis of alkenes and alkadienes, crucial precursors for fuels, plastics, and various materials. Research in this area has evolved significantly since then, particularly in understanding the role of different surface species on supported catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Surface area, for instance, affects the dispersion of vanadium species, impacting catalytic activity and selectivity. Higher metal loadings lead to larger vanadium domains and more V2O5 formation. Calcination influences the structure of supported vanadate units, with AlVO4 formation noted at higher loadings. Reducing conditions transform V5+ to V3+, and regeneration results in the formation of highly crystalline V5+ species. Lower reaction temperatures reduce the magnitude of structural changes, and regeneration leads to a shift in the nature of vanadium species, affecting catalytic behavior.

Regeneration processes can lead to the restoration of catalytic activity by converting more crystalline species back to polymeric ones, enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. However, polyolefinic coke species removed during high-temperature regeneration are not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation, which instead is attributed to tightly bound reaction intermediates that can be removed under mild conditions.

探索以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品用于烷烃脱氢，始于20世纪80年代，专注于形成烯烃和二烯烃，这些是燃料、塑料和其他材料的关键前体。自那时以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，特别是在理解支持催化剂上的不同表面物种的作用。载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量显著影响范德华物种在这些催化剂中的性质和行为。例如，表面积影响了范德华物种的分散，从而影响催化活性和选择性。更高的金属负载导致更大的范德华域和更多的V2O5形成。煅烧影响了支持范德酸盐单元的结构，在较高负载下观察到AlVO4的形成。还原条件将V5+转变为V3+，而再生则形成了高度结晶的V5+物种。较低反应温度减少了结构变化的幅度，并且再生过程导致了范德华物种性质的变化，影响了催化行为。

再生过程可以通过将更结晶的物种转换回聚合物状态来恢复催化活性，从而增强脱氢选择性。然而，在高温下去除的聚烯烃焦油物种不是催化剂失活的主要原因，而是紧密附着的反应中间体，可以在温和条件下从表面去除。
