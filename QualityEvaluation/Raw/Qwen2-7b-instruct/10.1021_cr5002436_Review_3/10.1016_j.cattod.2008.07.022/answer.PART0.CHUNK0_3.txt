The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has increasingly focused on supported vanadium oxides (VOx) for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, aiming to understand and optimize the role of different surface species on the catalysts. The structure of supported VOx units in catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation has been extensively studied. However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the distinct roles of various surface species on supported catalysts. The characterization of catalysts at various stages—before preparation, after calcination, post-reduction, post-reaction, and post-regeneration—has been carried out using solid-state NMR (51V MAS NMR, 27Al MAS NMR, and 27Al 3Q-MAS NMR), FT-IR spectroscopies, Raman spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. This enables researchers to establish correlations between the surface properties of VOx species and the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalysts. The research suggests that polymeric vanadia clusters promote the formation of butenes and butadienes, whereas more isolated species are highly effective in the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. However, these polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction.

自1980年代以来，对以二氧化钒（VOx）为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品进行烷烃脱氢的研究已经取得了显著进展。研究重点转向了支持型VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的应用，旨在理解并优化催化剂表面物种的作用。对于n-丁烷脱氢过程中支持型VOx单元结构的深入研究已得到广泛开展。然而，关于支持催化剂上不同表面物种的特异性作用仍存在不足之处。通过固态核磁共振（51V MAS NMR、27Al MAS NMR和27Al 3Q-MAS NMR）、傅里叶变换红外光谱、拉曼光谱和紫外可见光谱等技术对催化剂的不同阶段（准备前、煅烧后、还原后、反应后和再生后）进行了表征。这使得研究人员能够建立表面VOx物种与催化剂活性和选择性之间的关系。研究表明，聚合型范德华簇促进正丁烯和异丁二烯的形成，而孤立物种则在形成多核芳香烃上表现出高效能。然而，在n-丁烷脱氢反应中，这些多核芳香烃并非催化剂失活的主要原因。
