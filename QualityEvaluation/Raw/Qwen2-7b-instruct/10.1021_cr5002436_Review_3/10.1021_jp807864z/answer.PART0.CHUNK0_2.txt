Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation due to the pursuit of more affordable and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this field has advanced notably since the 1980s, concentrating on elucidating the structure-reactivity relationship and enhancing the stability and efficiency of vanadium-based catalysts. The characteristics and actions of vanadium species within these catalysts are affected by several factors, such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.
