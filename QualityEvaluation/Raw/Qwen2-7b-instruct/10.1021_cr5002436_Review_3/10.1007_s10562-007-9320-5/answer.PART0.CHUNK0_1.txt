<p>The coke deposition on the catalyst surface is one of the main reasons of the activity loss in the case of dehydrogenation reactions. It is well known, that alkenes, aromatics and cyclic compounds are more reactive than saturated hydrocarbons, thus their interaction with acidic centers on the catalyst surface may cause undesirable side reactions, such as oligomerization, aromatization or alkylation to heavier compounds, which are most important coke precursors.</p>
<p>In most of the papers on the catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons with carbon dioxide an observation prevails, that introduction of CO2 into the feed can decrease significantly (or even suppress) the coke deposition in comparison with the reaction under an inert gas atmosphere.</p>
<p>The results clearly indicate that the above explanation is correct only for VMgO x catalysts with low vanadium content (20 wt%), where the coking to dehydrogenation molar ratio was equal for both reactions (i.e., in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the feed).</p>
<p>As shown in Table 1, increase of vanadium loading in VMgO x can be related to considerable growth in acidity of the catalyst surface. This effect is not surprising, because V2O5 is well known for its acidic properties [20].</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that the carbon dioxide with its slightly acidic character requires basic sites for the activation. Thus, adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface should cause an increase of the catalyst acidity.</p>
<p>The role of particular centers in 2-propanol decomposition reaction is still under discussion, however it is generally accepted that acidic sites are responsible for the dehydration activity giving propene and isopropyl ether, while the basic sites promote dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone.</p>

The main factor driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation involves their potential cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst properties such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts, affecting their efficiency and stability. For instance, vanadium loading impacts the surface acidity of the catalysts, which is crucial for dehydrogenation reactions. The acidic nature of vanadium species facilitates the conversion of hydrocarbons into lighter, more valuable products, whereas the basic sites are responsible for unwanted side reactions like coke formation. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the reaction atmosphere can influence the catalyst's acidity, potentially enhancing or suppressing coke formation depending on the catalyst's composition and the reaction conditions. Overall, understanding how these factors interact is key to developing more efficient and selective vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

探索以五氧化二钒（V2O5）为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的主要原因是其成本效益和环境优势。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点优化催化剂的载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等特性。这些变量影响催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，进而影响催化效率和稳定性。例如，钒负载量影响催化剂表面的酸性，这对于脱氢反应至关重要。催化剂的酸性有助于将碳氢化合物转化为更轻、更有价值的产品，而基本位点则负责不希望的副反应，如焦炭形成。二氧化碳（CO2）在反应气氛中的存在可以影响催化剂的酸性，根据催化剂的组成和反应条件，可能增强或抑制焦炭形成。总体而言，理解这些因素之间的相互作用对于开发更高效、选择性的五氧化二钒基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢至关重要。
