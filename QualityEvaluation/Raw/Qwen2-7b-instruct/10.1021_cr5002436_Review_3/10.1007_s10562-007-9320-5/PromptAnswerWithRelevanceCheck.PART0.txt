<p>The process of isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide was carried out over VMgO x catalysts with different vanadium loading.</p>
<p>The performed tests show that both the reaction atmosphere and physicochemical properties of the catalysts (related to vanadium content) have a great influence on the activity decrease and the carbonaceous deposit formation.</p>
<p>Despite small ability of carbon dioxide to remove coke in the Boudouard reaction, the amounts of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts after the isobutane dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere were even twice greater in comparison to those deposited in helium stream.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rate of coke deposition during the dehydrogenation in the inert gas flow was only slightly dependent on the reaction time, in contrast to the process in carbon dioxide atmosphere.</p>
<p>The results show that the coke formation on VMgO x is enhanced predominantly by surface acidity of the catalysts, which grows with the vanadium content and the presence of CO2 in the feed.</p>

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. These catalysts offer advantages in terms of cost and sustainability compared to traditional materials. The nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts are influenced by various factors including carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts, particularly the surface acidity which increases with vanadium content and carbon dioxide presence in the feed, play a crucial role in the deactivation of these catalysts. Carbon dioxide, despite its limited ability to remove coke via the Boudouard reaction, tends to enhance coke deposition on vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts more significantly than under inert gas conditions. This is attributed to the increased surface acidity of the catalysts, which promotes undesirable side reactions leading to coke formation.

自1980年代以来，对以氧化钒为基的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品进行烷烃脱氢的研究已经取得了显著进展。这些催化剂在成本和可持续性方面具有优势，与传统材料相比。这些催化剂中钒物种的性质受到载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等多因素的影响。催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是随着钒含量增加和二氧化碳在反应流中存在时表面酸性的增加，对于这些催化剂的失活起着关键作用。二氧化碳虽然在去除焦炭方面的能力有限，但倾向于在含二氧化碳气氛下对范德镁氧催化剂的焦炭沉积量增加得更多，这比在惰性气体条件下更为明显。这一现象归因于催化剂表面酸性的增加，促进了不利于催化剂活性的副反应，导致焦炭形成。

<p>The coke deposition on the catalyst surface is one of the main reasons of the activity loss in the case of dehydrogenation reactions. It is well known, that alkenes, aromatics and cyclic compounds are more reactive than saturated hydrocarbons, thus their interaction with acidic centers on the catalyst surface may cause undesirable side reactions, such as oligomerization, aromatization or alkylation to heavier compounds, which are most important coke precursors.</p>
<p>In most of the papers on the catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons with carbon dioxide an observation prevails, that introduction of CO2 into the feed can decrease significantly (or even suppress) the coke deposition in comparison with the reaction under an inert gas atmosphere.</p>
<p>The results clearly indicate that the above explanation is correct only for VMgO x catalysts with low vanadium content (20 wt%), where the coking to dehydrogenation molar ratio was equal for both reactions (i.e., in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the feed).</p>
<p>As shown in Table 1, increase of vanadium loading in VMgO x can be related to considerable growth in acidity of the catalyst surface. This effect is not surprising, because V2O5 is well known for its acidic properties [20].</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that the carbon dioxide with its slightly acidic character requires basic sites for the activation. Thus, adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface should cause an increase of the catalyst acidity.</p>
<p>The role of particular centers in 2-propanol decomposition reaction is still under discussion, however it is generally accepted that acidic sites are responsible for the dehydration activity giving propene and isopropyl ether, while the basic sites promote dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone.</p>

The main factor driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation involves their potential cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst properties such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts, affecting their efficiency and stability. For instance, vanadium loading impacts the surface acidity of the catalysts, which is crucial for dehydrogenation reactions. The acidic nature of vanadium species facilitates the conversion of hydrocarbons into lighter, more valuable products, whereas the basic sites are responsible for unwanted side reactions like coke formation. The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the reaction atmosphere can influence the catalyst's acidity, potentially enhancing or suppressing coke formation depending on the catalyst's composition and the reaction conditions. Overall, understanding how these factors interact is key to developing more efficient and selective vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

探索以五氧化二钒（V2O5）为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的主要原因是其成本效益和环境优势。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点优化催化剂的载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等特性。这些变量影响催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，进而影响催化效率和稳定性。例如，钒负载量影响催化剂表面的酸性，这对于脱氢反应至关重要。催化剂的酸性有助于将碳氢化合物转化为更轻、更有价值的产品，而基本位点则负责不希望的副反应，如焦炭形成。二氧化碳（CO2）在反应气氛中的存在可以影响催化剂的酸性，根据催化剂的组成和反应条件，可能增强或抑制焦炭形成。总体而言，理解这些因素之间的相互作用对于开发更高效、选择性的五氧化二钒基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢至关重要。

[1] "Despite small ability of carbon dioxide to remove coke in the Boudouard reaction, the amounts of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts after the isobutane dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere were even twice greater in comparison to those deposited in helium stream."

[3] "The results clearly indicate that the above explanation is correct only for VMgO x catalysts with low vanadium content (20 wt%), where the coking to dehydrogenation molar ratio was equal for both reactions (i.e., in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the feed)."

1. The amounts of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts during isobutane dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere were significantly higher than under a helium stream. This indicates that CO2, despite its limited ability in removing coke via the Boudouard reaction, accelerates coke formation on the catalyst surfaces. 
2. Surface acidity of the catalysts plays a crucial role in the enhancement of coke formation during the dehydrogenation process. This acidity increases with the vanadium content and the presence of CO2 in the feed.
3. For catalysts with low vanadium content, the coke formation rate equals the dehydrogenation rate in the presence and absence of CO2, suggesting a balanced process. However, catalysts with higher vanadium content show a faster coke formation rate, indicating a dominant influence of surface acidity.
4. Vanadium content above 20 wt% leads to a significantly reduced activity of the catalysts under CO2 atmosphere, compared to a helium flow, which suggests that higher vanadium content exacerbates the negative effects of CO2 on catalyst performance.

1. 在二氧化碳气氛下的异丁烷脱氢过程中，沉积在催化剂表面的碳质物种的量远高于氦气流中的量。这表明二氧化碳，尽管其在布杜瓦尔德反应中去除焦炭的能力有限，仍能加速催化剂表面的焦炭形成。
2. 催化剂的表面酸性对焦炭形成起着关键作用。随着五氧化二钒含量和喂料中二氧化碳的存在增加，表面酸性也随之增加。
3. 对于低五氧化二钒含量的催化剂，在有无二氧化碳存在的情况下，脱氢速率与焦炭生成速率相等，表明这是一个平衡过程。然而，高五氧化二钒含量的催化剂显示出更快的焦炭生成速率，表明表面酸性起主导作用。
4. 五氧化二钒含量超过20 wt%会导致催化剂在二氧化碳气氛下的活性显著降低，与氦气流相比，这表明较高的五氧化二钒含量加剧了二氧化碳对催化剂性能的负面影响。

1. Surface acidity, vanadium content, and the presence of CO2 in the feed significantly enhance the formation of coke on VMgO x catalysts during the isobutane dehydrogenation process. This effect is more pronounced with higher vanadium content and CO2 presence.

2. The explanation for enhanced coke formation holds true specifically for VMgO x catalysts with low vanadium content (20 wt%). The coking to dehydrogenation molar ratio is equal for reactions with and without carbon dioxide under these conditions.

3. The highest initial isobutane conversion was observed over VMgO x catalysts with 20% vanadium content when the reaction was carried out under a carbon dioxide atmosphere.

4. Carbonaceous species can be produced not only from the direct dehydrogenation of isobutane but also from the subsequent conversion of olefins and the undesirable disproportionation of carbon oxide, which acts as an equilibrium reverse Boudouard reaction.

1. 表面酸性、钒含量和反应气体中二氧化碳的存在显著增加了VMgO x 催化剂在异丁烷脱氢过程中焦炭的生成。这种效应随着钒含量的增加和二氧化碳存在的增加而变得更加明显。

2. 这种解释仅适用于低钒含量（20 wt%）的VMgO x 催化剂。在这些条件下，焦炭生成与二氧化碳存在的摩尔比相等。

3. 最初的异丁烷转化率最高是在20%钒含量的VMgO x 催化剂上观察到的，当反应在二氧化碳气氛下进行时。

4. 焦炭物种不仅可以直接从异丁烷的脱氢产生，还可以从烯烃的后续转化以及作为平衡逆布杜瓦德反应的二氧化碳氧化物的分解产生。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been influenced by factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding how these variables impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts. Variables like carrier type can affect the dispersion of vanadium, impacting its reactivity and stability. Support surface area influences the availability of active sites for reaction, potentially altering the dehydrogenation efficiency. Metal loading, particularly vanadium, plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's acidity, which has been shown to enhance coke formation. This is due to the surface acidity growing with both the vanadium content and the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the feed. CO2, while capable of removing some carbonaceous deposits via the Boudouard reaction, does not effectively counteract the accelerated coke formation rate under its influence. Consequently, the effectiveness of CO2 as a promoter decreases over time as the deactivation rate increases due to the enhanced coke deposition. The overall behavior of vanadium oxide catalysts under CO2 conditions is characterized by a faster coke deposition rate compared to inert gas atmospheres, leading to a more rapid deactivation of the catalysts.

对铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）作为正构烷烃脱氢的替代催化剂的探索，受到了载体类型、支持表面积以及金属负载等因素的影响。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于理解这些变量如何影响催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。载体类型可以影响钒的分散性，从而影响其反应性和稳定性。支持表面积影响活性位点的可用性，可能改变脱氢效率。尤其是钒的负载量，在确定催化剂的酸性方面起着关键作用，这种酸性与钒含量和反应过程中二氧化碳（CO2）的存在有关，已被证明会促进焦炭的形成。这主要是由于随着钒含量和CO2的存在，催化剂表面的酸性增加。虽然CO2有能力通过布杜瓦德反应去除部分碳沉积物，但它不能有效抵消在CO2气氛下加速的焦炭沉积速率。因此，CO2作为促进剂的效果随时间的推移而减弱，这是由于焦炭沉积率的增加导致催化剂的快速失活。在CO2条件下，催化剂的总体行为表现为比惰性气体气氛更快的焦炭沉积速率，导致催化剂的快速失效。
