<p>The process of isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide was carried out over VMgO x catalysts with different vanadium loading.</p>
<p>The performed tests show that both the reaction atmosphere and physicochemical properties of the catalysts (related to vanadium content) have a great influence on the activity decrease and the carbonaceous deposit formation.</p>
<p>Despite small ability of carbon dioxide to remove coke in the Boudouard reaction, the amounts of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts after the isobutane dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere were even twice greater in comparison to those deposited in helium stream.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rate of coke deposition during the dehydrogenation in the inert gas flow was only slightly dependent on the reaction time, in contrast to the process in carbon dioxide atmosphere.</p>
<p>The results show that the coke formation on VMgO x is enhanced predominantly by surface acidity of the catalysts, which grows with the vanadium content and the presence of CO2 in the feed.</p>

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. These catalysts offer advantages in terms of cost and sustainability compared to traditional materials. The nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts are influenced by various factors including carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts, particularly the surface acidity which increases with vanadium content and carbon dioxide presence in the feed, play a crucial role in the deactivation of these catalysts. Carbon dioxide, despite its limited ability to remove coke via the Boudouard reaction, tends to enhance coke deposition on vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts more significantly than under inert gas conditions. This is attributed to the increased surface acidity of the catalysts, which promotes undesirable side reactions leading to coke formation.

自1980年代以来，对以氧化钒为基的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品进行烷烃脱氢的研究已经取得了显著进展。这些催化剂在成本和可持续性方面具有优势，与传统材料相比。这些催化剂中钒物种的性质受到载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等多因素的影响。催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是随着钒含量增加和二氧化碳在反应流中存在时表面酸性的增加，对于这些催化剂的失活起着关键作用。二氧化碳虽然在去除焦炭方面的能力有限，但倾向于在含二氧化碳气氛下对范德镁氧催化剂的焦炭沉积量增加得更多，这比在惰性气体条件下更为明显。这一现象归因于催化剂表面酸性的增加，促进了不利于催化剂活性的副反应，导致焦炭形成。
