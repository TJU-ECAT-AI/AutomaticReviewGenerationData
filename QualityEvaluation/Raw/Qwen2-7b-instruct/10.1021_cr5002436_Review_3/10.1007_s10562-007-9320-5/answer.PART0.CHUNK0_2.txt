[1] "Despite small ability of carbon dioxide to remove coke in the Boudouard reaction, the amounts of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts after the isobutane dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere were even twice greater in comparison to those deposited in helium stream."
[2] "The coke formation on VMgO x is enhanced predominantly by surface acidity of the catalysts, which grows with the vanadium content and the presence of CO2 in the feed."
[3] "The results clearly indicate that the above explanation is correct only for VMgO x catalysts with low vanadium content (20 wt%), where the coking to dehydrogenation molar ratio was equal for both reactions (i.e., in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the feed)."
[4] "On the other hand, the activity of vanadiummagnesium oxide catalysts with V2O5 content above 20 wt% was much lower under CO2 atmosphere than that under helium flow."

1. The amounts of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts during isobutane dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere were significantly higher than under a helium stream. This indicates that CO2, despite its limited ability in removing coke via the Boudouard reaction, accelerates coke formation on the catalyst surfaces. 
2. Surface acidity of the catalysts plays a crucial role in the enhancement of coke formation during the dehydrogenation process. This acidity increases with the vanadium content and the presence of CO2 in the feed.
3. For catalysts with low vanadium content, the coke formation rate equals the dehydrogenation rate in the presence and absence of CO2, suggesting a balanced process. However, catalysts with higher vanadium content show a faster coke formation rate, indicating a dominant influence of surface acidity.
4. Vanadium content above 20 wt% leads to a significantly reduced activity of the catalysts under CO2 atmosphere, compared to a helium flow, which suggests that higher vanadium content exacerbates the negative effects of CO2 on catalyst performance.

1. 在二氧化碳气氛下的异丁烷脱氢过程中，沉积在催化剂表面的碳质物种的量远高于氦气流中的量。这表明二氧化碳，尽管其在布杜瓦尔德反应中去除焦炭的能力有限，仍能加速催化剂表面的焦炭形成。
2. 催化剂的表面酸性对焦炭形成起着关键作用。随着五氧化二钒含量和喂料中二氧化碳的存在增加，表面酸性也随之增加。
3. 对于低五氧化二钒含量的催化剂，在有无二氧化碳存在的情况下，脱氢速率与焦炭生成速率相等，表明这是一个平衡过程。然而，高五氧化二钒含量的催化剂显示出更快的焦炭生成速率，表明表面酸性起主导作用。
4. 五氧化二钒含量超过20 wt%会导致催化剂在二氧化碳气氛下的活性显著降低，与氦气流相比，这表明较高的五氧化二钒含量加剧了二氧化碳对催化剂性能的负面影响。
