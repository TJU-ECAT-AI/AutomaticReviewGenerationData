<p>The process of isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide was carried out over VMgO x catalysts with different vanadium loading.</p>
<p>The performed tests show that both the reaction atmosphere and physicochemical properties of the catalysts (related to vanadium content) have a great influence on the activity decrease and the carbonaceous deposit formation.</p>
<p>Despite small ability of carbon dioxide to remove coke in the Boudouard reaction, the amounts of carbonaceous species deposited on the catalysts after the isobutane dehydrogenation under CO2 atmosphere were even twice greater in comparison to those deposited in helium stream.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rate of coke deposition during the dehydrogenation in the inert gas flow was only slightly dependent on the reaction time, in contrast to the process in carbon dioxide atmosphere.</p>
<p>The results show that the coke formation on VMgO x is enhanced predominantly by surface acidity of the catalysts, which grows with the vanadium content and the presence of CO2 in the feed.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that carbon dioxide stream is able to gasify some part of the carbonaceous species formed on the catalyst surface, although it does not remove all deposit under steady-state conditions.</p>
<p>Hence, the rate of coking has to be faster than the rate of decoking.</p>
<p>More intensive deactivation of catalysts in the dehydrogenation process under carbon dioxide flow is caused by higher rate of coke formation in comparison to the process in helium atmosphere.</p>
<p>Thus, the promoting effect of CO2 decreases with time on-stream.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been influenced by factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding how these variables impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts. Variables like carrier type can affect the dispersion of vanadium, impacting its reactivity and stability. Support surface area influences the availability of active sites for reaction, potentially altering the dehydrogenation efficiency. Metal loading, particularly vanadium, plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's acidity, which has been shown to enhance coke formation. This is due to the surface acidity growing with both the vanadium content and the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the feed. CO2, while capable of removing some carbonaceous deposits via the Boudouard reaction, does not effectively counteract the accelerated coke formation rate under its influence. Consequently, the effectiveness of CO2 as a promoter decreases over time as the deactivation rate increases due to the enhanced coke deposition. The overall behavior of vanadium oxide catalysts under CO2 conditions is characterized by a faster coke deposition rate compared to inert gas atmospheres, leading to a more rapid deactivation of the catalysts.

对铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）作为正构烷烃脱氢的替代催化剂的探索，受到了载体类型、支持表面积以及金属负载等因素的影响。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于理解这些变量如何影响催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。载体类型可以影响钒的分散性，从而影响其反应性和稳定性。支持表面积影响活性位点的可用性，可能改变脱氢效率。尤其是钒的负载量，在确定催化剂的酸性方面起着关键作用，这种酸性与钒含量和反应过程中二氧化碳（CO2）的存在有关，已被证明会促进焦炭的形成。这主要是由于随着钒含量和CO2的存在，催化剂表面的酸性增加。虽然CO2有能力通过布杜瓦德反应去除部分碳沉积物，但它不能有效抵消在CO2气氛下加速的焦炭沉积速率。因此，CO2作为促进剂的效果随时间的推移而减弱，这是由于焦炭沉积率的增加导致催化剂的快速失活。在CO2条件下，催化剂的总体行为表现为比惰性气体气氛更快的焦炭沉积速率，导致催化剂的快速失效。
