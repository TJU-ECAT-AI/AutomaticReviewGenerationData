1. Surface acidity, vanadium content, and the presence of CO2 in the feed significantly enhance the formation of coke on VMgO x catalysts during the isobutane dehydrogenation process. This effect is more pronounced with higher vanadium content and CO2 presence.

2. The explanation for enhanced coke formation holds true specifically for VMgO x catalysts with low vanadium content (20 wt%). The coking to dehydrogenation molar ratio is equal for reactions with and without carbon dioxide under these conditions.

3. The highest initial isobutane conversion was observed over VMgO x catalysts with 20% vanadium content when the reaction was carried out under a carbon dioxide atmosphere.

4. Carbonaceous species can be produced not only from the direct dehydrogenation of isobutane but also from the subsequent conversion of olefins and the undesirable disproportionation of carbon oxide, which acts as an equilibrium reverse Boudouard reaction.

1. 表面酸性、钒含量和反应气体中二氧化碳的存在显著增加了VMgO x 催化剂在异丁烷脱氢过程中焦炭的生成。这种效应随着钒含量的增加和二氧化碳存在的增加而变得更加明显。

2. 这种解释仅适用于低钒含量（20 wt%）的VMgO x 催化剂。在这些条件下，焦炭生成与二氧化碳存在的摩尔比相等。

3. 最初的异丁烷转化率最高是在20%钒含量的VMgO x 催化剂上观察到的，当反应在二氧化碳气氛下进行时。

4. 焦炭物种不仅可以直接从异丁烷的脱氢产生，还可以从烯烃的后续转化以及作为平衡逆布杜瓦德反应的二氧化碳氧化物的分解产生。
