[1] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine revealed that the enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio of the support is caused by the decrease of the acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization."
[2] "As presented in Table 1, the bulk Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 supports measured by XRF is close to that of the initial gel."
[3] "The BET specific surface areas of the HZSM-5 supported samples are in the range of 344-379 m2/g; such values are much larger than that of b-Ga2O3."
[4] "Both the total amount of acid sites and that of medium to strong acid sites decrease sharply."
[5] "The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine."
[6] "The initial ethane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, showing that the acidities of the supported gallium oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."
[7] "As listed in Table 3, 40.9% of methane and 15.3% of aromatics are formed due to the side reaction such as cracking, cyclization and oligomerization."
[8] "The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst has the highest steady ethane conversion and the highest steady ethylene yield."
[9] "The stability of the catalysts was greatly improved after the addition of CO2."
[10] "Results of the dehydrogenation reaction with different partial pressures of CO2 indicate that there are two roles of CO2 existing in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and a negative role by displacing ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of catalyst."
