[1] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine revealed that the enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio of the support is caused by the decrease of the acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization."
[2] "As the Si/Al ratio increases, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases. The catalytic stability is superior for the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher than 90."
[3] "Results of the dehydrogenation reaction with different partial pressures of CO2 indicate that there are two roles of CO2 existing in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water gas shift reaction, and a negative role by displacing ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "The stability is also improved greatly by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation coming from two aspects: elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction and promotion of desorption of ethylene from the catalyst surface."

1. The catalyst stability improves with the increase of the Si/Al ratio of the support, which is attributed to the decreased acidity of the catalysts, leading to the suppression of side reactions such as cracking and oligomerization.
2. As the Si/Al ratio increases, the initial activity of HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalysts declines, yet the catalytic stability is superior for catalysts with a Si/Al ratio higher than 90.
3. Carbon dioxide plays dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: it positively removes absorbed hydrogen on the catalyst surface via the reverse water gas shift reaction, and negatively displaces ethane adsorbed on the basic sites of the catalyst.
4. The addition of carbon dioxide enhances catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation through both the Boudouard reaction and promoting ethylene desorption from the catalyst surface.

1. 随着支持物中Si/Al比的增加，催化剂稳定性提高，这是由于催化剂酸性的降低，导致抑制裂解和多聚化等副反应。
2. 随着Si/Al比的增加，HZSM-5支持的Ga2O3催化剂的初始活性下降，但Si/Al比高于90的催化剂具有更好的催化稳定性。
3. 二氧化碳在脱氢反应中扮演双重角色：它通过逆水煤气变换反应积极移除催化剂表面吸附的氢，同时消极地置换催化剂基质上吸附的乙烷。
4. 通过消除焦炭并促进乙烯从催化剂表面的脱附，二氧化碳的添加通过Boudouard反应和促进乙稀脱附两种方式显著提高了催化剂的稳定性。
