<p>The initial ethane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, showing that the acidities of the supported gallium oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>As listed in Table 3, 40.9% of methane and 15.3% of aromatics are formed due to the side reaction such as cracking, cyclization and oligomerization.</p>
<p>However, the stability of b-Ga2O3 is rather poor and the activity drops dramatically to one-tenth within 5 h.</p>
<p>The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction can be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2 with CO2 into CO and H2O.</p>
<p>The stability is also improved greatly by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of coke formation.</p>

1. The initial ethane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, indicating that the acidities of the supported gallium oxide catalysts significantly affect their dehydrogenation activity.
2. Side reactions like cracking, cyclization, and oligomerization lead to the formation of 40.9% methane and 15.3% aromatics.
3. b-Ga2O3 shows poor stability, with its activity dropping to one-tenth within 5 hours.
4. Carbon dioxide promotes the reaction by enabling the reverse water gas shift, transforming H2 into CO and H2O.
5. Adding carbon dioxide enhances catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation.

1. 随着Si/Al比率的增加，初始乙烷转化率下降，这表明支持镓氧化物催化剂的酸性对脱氢化活性有很大影响。
2. 分解、环化和聚合等副反应导致形成40.9%的甲烷和15.3%的芳香烃。
3. b-Ga2O3的稳定性较差，其活性在5小时内降低到十分之一。
4. 碳二酸通过促进水煤气逆向反应，将H2转化为CO和H2O来促进反应。
5. 添加碳二酸可以增强催化剂稳定性，抑制焦炭形成。
