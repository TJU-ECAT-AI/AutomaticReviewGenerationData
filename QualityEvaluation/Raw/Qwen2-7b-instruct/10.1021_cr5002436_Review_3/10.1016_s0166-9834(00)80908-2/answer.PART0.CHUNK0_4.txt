The study investigates the conversion of propane to benzenic compounds at 530°C using a series of GaHZSM5 catalysts. Gallium species enhance both the rate of propane conversion and the selectivity for aromatic products. These species exhibit dehydrogenating activity, boosting propane activation and naphthene aromatization. The conversion process can be seen as a bifunctional mechanism, where dehydrogenation reactions are catalyzed by gallium species and oligomerization and oligomer cyclization are facilitated by the acid sites. Active gallium species appear to be gallium oxide dispersed within the zeolite matrix, rather than gallium cations in an exchange position. Gallium species play a crucial role in enhancing the selectivity for aromatic products without altering the acidity of the HZSM5 catalyst. In the reaction scheme, gallium species intervene in step 5, catalyzing the dehydrogenation of C6-Cs alicyclic compounds into aromatics.

研究在530°C下使用一系列GaHZSM5催化剂，对丙烷转化为苯环化合物的过程进行了考察。镓物种提高了丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性。这些物种具有脱氢活性，促进了丙烷活化和萘环芳构化。该转化过程可视为一个双功能过程，其中脱氢反应由镓物种催化，而多聚体化和多聚体环化则由酸中心促进。活跃的镓物种似乎是分散在沸石中的镓氧化物，而不是交换位置的镓离子。镓物种通过提高芳烃选择性而不改变HZSM5催化剂的酸性，显著增强了丙烷转化率。在反应方案中，镓物种在步骤5中起作用，催化C6-Cs环状化合物转化为芳香烃。
