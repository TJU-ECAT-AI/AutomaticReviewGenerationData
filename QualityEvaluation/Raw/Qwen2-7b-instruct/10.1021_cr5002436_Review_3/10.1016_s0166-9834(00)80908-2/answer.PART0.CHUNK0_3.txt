[1] "The conversion of propane into benzenic compounds was studied at 530C on a series of GaHZSM5 catalysts prepared by impregnation of HZSM5 with a solution of gallium nitrate."
[2] "Gal- lium species increase the rate of propane conversion and the selectivity for aromatics."
[3] "These spe- cies have dehydrogenating activity, increasing both propane activation and naphthene aromatization."
[4] "The conversion of propane into benzenic compounds on GaHZSM5 catalysts can be considered, therefore, as a bifunctional process in which dehydrogenation reactions are cata- lyzed by the gallium species and oligomerization and oligomer cyclization by the acid sites."
[5] "The active gallium species seem to be gallium oxide dispersed in the zeolite rather than gallium cations in an exchange position."

The study investigated the conversion of propane to aromatic compounds at 530°C using a series of GaHZSM5 catalysts. Gallium species were found to enhance the rate of propane conversion and the selectivity for aromatic products. These species demonstrated dehydrogenating activity, boosting both propane activation and naphthene aromatization. The conversion process on GaHZSM5 catalysts was deemed bifunctional, with dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by the gallium species and oligomerization and oligomer cyclization by the acid sites. The active gallium species were identified as dispersed gallium oxide within the zeolite rather than gallium cations in an exchange position.

研究在530°C下使用一系列GaHZSM5催化剂对丙烷进行了芳香化合物的转换。镓物种被发现可以提高丙烷转化率和芳烃选择性。这些物种表现出脱氢活性，增强了丙烷激活和萘类芳香化。在GaHZSM5催化剂上的转化过程被认为是双功能的，脱氢反应由镓物种催化，而多聚体和多聚体环化由酸中心催化。活跃的镓物种被识别为在沸石中分散的镓氧化物，而不是交换位置的镓离子。
