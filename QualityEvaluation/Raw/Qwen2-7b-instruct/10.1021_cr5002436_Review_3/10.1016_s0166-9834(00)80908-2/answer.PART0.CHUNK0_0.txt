[1] "As Kitagawa et al. [2] have shown in the conversion of propane, the exchange of HZSM5 by Ga3 + improves greatly the selectivity towards aromatics."
[2] "Gallium species increase the rate of propane conversion and the selectivity for aromatics."
[3] "The conversion of propane into benzenic compounds on GaHZSM5 catalysts can be considered, therefore, as a bifunctional process in which dehydrogenation reactions are catalyzed by the gallium species and oligomerization and oligomer cyclization by the acid sites."
[4] "The role of gallium species in propane aromatization is particularly significant because on gallium species this step occurs without the simultaneous production of light alkanes, as occurs on the acid sites (hydrogen transfer reaction)."

The role of gallium species in propane aromatization is significant as they enhance both the rate and selectivity of propane conversion into aromatic compounds. This process can be seen as a bifunctional mechanism where dehydrogenation reactions are catalyzed by gallium species, while oligomerization and oligomer cyclization are facilitated by the acid sites of the catalyst. The activity of gallium species seems to be attributed to gallium oxide dispersed within the zeolite structure rather than gallium cations in an exchange position. The enhanced selectivity for aromatics suggests that gallium species play a crucial role in the conversion of propane into aromatic hydrocarbons without the simultaneous production of light alkanes, unlike the acid sites which facilitate hydrogen transfer reactions.

在丙烷芳香化过程中，镓物种的作用显著，既能提高丙烷转化速率，又能增强芳烃选择性。这一过程可以被视为一个双功能机制，其中脱氢反应由镓物种催化，而多聚体和多聚体环化则由催化剂上的酸位点促进。活动性镓物种的作用似乎归因于在沸石结构中的分散镓氧化物，而不是交换位置的镓离子。增强的芳烃选择性表明，镓物种在将丙烷转化为芳香烃时具有关键作用，且不会同时产生轻烷烃，这与酸位点促进的氢转移反应不同。
