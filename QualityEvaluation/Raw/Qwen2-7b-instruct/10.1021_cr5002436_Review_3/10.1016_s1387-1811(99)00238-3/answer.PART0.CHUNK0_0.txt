[1] "The addition of Ga to Pt/BEA caused the size of the resulting Pt particles to be dramatically decreased as detected by TEM (Fig. 9)."
[2] "Such a decrease could be explained by the surface coverage of the platinum particles with Ga atoms, with the possible presence of interstitial hydrogen that, in turn, may prevent the sintering of Pt aggregates into large particles."
[3] "This may also reduce the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt and makes Pt/Ga/zeolite less resistant to coke deactivation."
[4] "Analyses of the Ga K-edge EXAFS and XANES spectra suggested that during calcination most of the gallium(III) ions are converted to Ga3+(t) as isolated GaO4 in the tetrahedral coordination and are subsequently reduced to yield zero charge-like Ga species, which occurs as a supported gallium hydride oligomer or as a galliumMplatinum bimetallic species."
[5] "The formation of a GaPt bimetallic species on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites was also confirmed by Pt L-edge EXAFS and was found to contribute to a decrease in the particle size of Pt metal aggregates."

1. The addition of gallium (Ga) to platinum (Pt)/beta zeolite (BEA) catalysts significantly reduces the size of the resulting Pt particles, as observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
2. This reduction in particle size is attributed to the surface coverage of Pt particles with Ga atoms, which may also prevent the sintering of Pt aggregates into larger particles. 
3. The decrease in particle size contributes to a reduction in the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt, making Pt/Ga/zeolite less susceptible to coke deactivation.
4. X-ray absorption spectroscopic analyses revealed that during calcination, most gallium(III) ions convert to isolated tetrahedral gallium oxygens (Ga3+(t)), which are then reduced to zero-valence gallium species. These species can exist as supported gallium hydride oligomers or gallium-platinum bimetallic complexes.
5. The confirmation of GaPt bimetallic species formation on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites not only decreases the particle size of Pt metal aggregates but also plays a role in the catalytic properties of these materials.

1.X将铂（Pt）/β沸石（BEA）催化剂中的添加显著减小了生成的Pt颗粒的尺寸，这通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）观察到。
2. 这一尺寸的减少归因于Pt颗粒表面覆盖了X原子，可能还阻止了Pt团聚物转化为大颗粒。  
3. 这种减小的颗粒尺寸导致了Pt的氢化和氢解活性的降低，使Pt/X沸石催化剂更不容易被焦炭失活。
4.XR吸收光谱分析显示，在煅烧过程中，大部分的三价镓离子转化为孤立的四面体镓氧（Ga3+(t)），然后被还原为零价的镓物种。这些物种可以以支持的镓氢化寡聚体或镓-铂双金属复合物的形式存在。
5. 确认在还原后的Pt/X沸石催化剂上形成了GaPt双金属物种不仅减少了Pt金属颗粒的聚集尺寸，而且在这些材料的催化性质中也发挥了作用。
