1. Gallium species mainly exist as isolated GaO4 units after calcination.
2. Upon reduction, gallium(III) cations are removed forming gallium hydride oligomers or attaching to platinum particles.
3. The gallium hydride oligomer consists of two gallium atoms separated by 2.99 A with bridging hydrogen atoms.
4. The gallium and platinum EXAFS analyses indicate the formation of GaPt bimetallic species with an interatomic distance of 2.51-2.54 A.
5. The presence of a PtMPt distance shorter than 2.05 A and a PtMGa distance of 2.99 A suggests small Pt clusters interacting with the support.
6. Fourier transforms of Ga K-edge EXAFS spectra and curve-fitting results compare calcinated and reduced Pt/Ga/BEA with Ga2O3.
7. After reduction at 550C, the PtMGa peak intensity significantly increases.

1. 加兰姆物种主要在煅烧后以孤立的GaO4单元存在。
2. 在还原后，镓(III)离子从晶格中移除形成镓氢化物寡聚体或附着到铂颗粒上。
3. 镓氢化物寡聚体由两个镓原子组成，它们通过桥接氢原子相隔2.99 A。
4. 镓和铂的EXAFS分析表明形成了GaPt二元合金物种，其间原子距离为2.51-2.54 A。
5. PtMPt距离小于2.05 A且PtMGa距离为2.99 A的存在表明了小铂簇与支撑物的相互作用。
6. Ga K边EXAFS光谱的傅里叶变换和曲线拟合结果将煅烧和还原后的Pt/Ga/BEA与Ga2O3进行比较。
7. 在550°C还原后，PtMGa峰强度显著增加。
