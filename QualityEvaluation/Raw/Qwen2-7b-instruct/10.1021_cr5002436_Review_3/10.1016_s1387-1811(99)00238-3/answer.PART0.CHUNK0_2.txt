<p>The addition of Ga to Pt/BEA caused the size of the resulting Pt particles to be dramatically decreased as detected by TEM (Fig. 9).</p>
<p>Such a decrease could be explained by the surface coverage of the platinum particles with Ga atoms, with the possible presence of interstitial hydrogen that, in turn, may prevent the sintering of Pt aggregates into large particles.</p>
<p>This may also reduce the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt and makes Pt/Ga/zeolite less resistant to coke deactivation.</p>
<p>Analyses of the Ga K-edge EXAFS and XANES spectra suggested that during calcination most of the gallium(III) ions are converted to Ga3+(t) as isolated GaO4 in the tetrahedral coordination and are subsequently reduced to yield zero charge-like Ga species, which occurs as a supported gallium hydride oligomer or as a galliumMplatinum bimetallic species.</p>
<p>The formation of a GaPt bimetallic species on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites was also confirmed by Pt L-edge EXAFS and was found to contribute to a decrease in the particle size of Pt metal aggregates.</p>

1. The addition of gallium to platinum on beta zeolite (Pt/Ga/BEA) leads to a significant decrease in the size of the resulting platinum particles as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This reduction is attributed to the surface coverage of the platinum particles by gallium atoms, possibly accompanied by interstitial hydrogen, which inhibits the sintering of platinum aggregates into larger particles. This decrease in particle size reduces the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of platinum and makes the Pt/Ga/zeolite catalyst less susceptible to coke deactivation.
2. The gallium species in Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites go through a transformation during calcination. Most of the gallium(III) ions convert to isolated GaO4 units in a tetrahedral coordination. Upon reduction, these ions are transformed into zero-valent gallium species, existing as supported gallium hydride oligomers or gallium-platinum bimetallic species. The formation of gallium-platinum bimetallic species on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites contributes to a decrease in the size of the platinum metal aggregates.

1. 向β沸石负载的铂（Pt/Ga/BEA）添加镓会导致生成的铂颗粒显著减小，通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）检测到。这种减少可以解释为铂颗粒表面被镓原子覆盖，可能伴随着间隙氢的存在，这阻止了铂团聚形成大颗粒。这种颗粒尺寸的减小降低了铂的加氢和氢解活性，并使Pt/Ga/沸石催化剂对焦炭失活的抵抗力降低。
2. Pt/Ga/BEA沸石中的镓物种在煅烧过程中经历变化。大多数三价镓离子转化为四面体配合物形式的孤立镓O4单位。在还原后，这些离子转化为零电荷的镓物种，以支持的镓氢化物寡聚体或镓-铂二元合金物种的形式存在。在还原后的Pt/Ga/BEA沸石上形成的镓-铂二元合金物种导致铂金属聚集物的尺寸减小。
