[1] "Analyses of the Ga K-edge EXAFS and XANES spectra suggested that during calcination most of the gallium(III) ions are converted to Ga3+(t) as isolated GaO4 in the tetrahedral coordination and are subsequently reduced to yield zero charge-like Ga species, which occurs as a supported gallium hydride oligomer or as a galliumMplatinum bimetallic species. The formation of a GaPt bimetallic species on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites was also confirmed by Pt L-edge EXAFS and was found to contribute to a decrease in the particle size of Pt metal aggregates."
[2] "Such a decrease could be explained by the surface coverage of the platinum particles with Ga atoms, with the possible presence of interstitial hydrogen that,in turn, may prevent the sintering of Pt aggregates into large particles."
[3] "This may also reduce the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt and makes Pt/Ga/zeolite less resistant to coke deactivation."
[4] "These analyses provide an explanation for the effect of addition of Pt to Ga/zeolite in promoting the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, with little or no effect on aromatization."

1. The EXAFS and XANES spectra analysis revealed that during calcination, gallium(III) ions primarily transformed into isolated GaO4 units in a tetrahedral coordination, which were later reduced into zero-charge gallium species. These species exist as a supported gallium hydride oligomer or a gallium-platinum bimetallic species. The formation of a GaPt bimetallic species was confirmed through Pt L-edge EXAFS and contributed to a reduction in the size of Pt metal aggregates.

2. The decrease in the size of Pt aggregates can be attributed to the surface coverage of Pt particles by Ga atoms, along with the presence of interstitial hydrogen. This prevents the sintering of Pt aggregates into larger particles.

3. This reduction in size also decreases the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt, making Pt/Ga/zeolite less susceptible to coke deactivation.

4. These findings explain how the addition of Pt to Ga/zeolite enhances the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, with minimal impact on aromatization.

1. EXAFS和XANES谱分析表明，在煅烧过程中，大部分三价镓离子转化为四面体配合的孤立GaO4，并随后被还原为零电荷的镓物种。这些物种以支持的镓氢化寡聚体或镓-铂二元合金物种的形式存在。通过Pt L边EXAFS确认了在还原Pt/Ga/BEA沸石上形成的GaPt二元合金物种，并发现这导致了Pt金属团簇尺寸的减少。

2. 这种尺寸的减少可以归因于Pt颗粒表面覆盖着Ga原子，以及可能存在间隙氢。这阻止了Pt团簇聚集成为较大的颗粒。

3. 这种减小也降低了Pt的加氢和氢解活性，使得Pt/Ga/沸石更不易受到焦炭降解。

4. 这些结果解释了将Pt添加到Ga/沸石中如何促进烷烃的脱氢形成烯烃，而对芳构化几乎没有影响。
