[1] "The addition of Ga to Pt/BEA caused the size of the resulting Pt particles to be dramatically decreased as detected by TEM (Fig. 9)."
[2] "Such a decrease could be explained by the surface coverage of the platinum particles with Ga atoms, with the possible presence of interstitial hydrogen that, in turn, may prevent the sintering of Pt aggregates into large particles."
[3] "This may also reduce the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt and makes Pt/Ga/zeolite less resistant to coke deactivation."
[4] "Analyses of the Ga K-edge EXAFS and XANES spectra suggested that during calcination most of the gallium(III) ions are converted to Ga3+(t) as isolated GaO4 in the tetrahedral coordination and are subsequently reduced to yield zero charge-like Ga species, which occurs as a supported gallium hydride oligomer or as a galliumMplatinum bimetallic species."
[5] "The formation of a GaPt bimetallic species on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites was also confirmed by Pt L-edge EXAFS and was found to contribute to a decrease in the particle size of Pt metal aggregates."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The addition of gallium (Ga) to platinum (Pt)/beta zeolite (BEA) catalysts significantly reduces the size of the resulting Pt particles, as observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
2. This reduction in particle size is attributed to the surface coverage of Pt particles with Ga atoms, which may also prevent the sintering of Pt aggregates into larger particles. 
3. The decrease in particle size contributes to a reduction in the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt, making Pt/Ga/zeolite less susceptible to coke deactivation.
4. X-ray absorption spectroscopic analyses revealed that during calcination, most gallium(III) ions convert to isolated tetrahedral gallium oxygens (Ga3+(t)), which are then reduced to zero-valence gallium species. These species can exist as supported gallium hydride oligomers or gallium-platinum bimetallic complexes.
5. The confirmation of GaPt bimetallic species formation on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites not only decreases the particle size of Pt metal aggregates but also plays a role in the catalytic properties of these materials.

1.X将铂（Pt）/β沸石（BEA）催化剂中的添加显著减小了生成的Pt颗粒的尺寸，这通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）观察到。
2. 这一尺寸的减少归因于Pt颗粒表面覆盖了X原子，可能还阻止了Pt团聚物转化为大颗粒。  
3. 这种减小的颗粒尺寸导致了Pt的氢化和氢解活性的降低，使Pt/X沸石催化剂更不容易被焦炭失活。
4.XR吸收光谱分析显示，在煅烧过程中，大部分的三价镓离子转化为孤立的四面体镓氧（Ga3+(t)），然后被还原为零价的镓物种。这些物种可以以支持的镓氢化寡聚体或镓-铂双金属复合物的形式存在。
5. 确认在还原后的Pt/X沸石催化剂上形成了GaPt双金属物种不仅减少了Pt金属颗粒的聚集尺寸，而且在这些材料的催化性质中也发挥了作用。

1. The addition of gallium to platinum on beta zeolite (Pt/Ga/BEA) leads to a significant decrease in the size of the resulting platinum particles as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This reduction is attributed to the surface coverage of the platinum particles by gallium atoms, possibly accompanied by interstitial hydrogen, which inhibits the sintering of platinum aggregates into larger particles. This decrease in particle size reduces the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of platinum and makes the Pt/Ga/zeolite catalyst less susceptible to coke deactivation.
2. The gallium species in Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites go through a transformation during calcination. Most of the gallium(III) ions convert to isolated GaO4 units in a tetrahedral coordination. Upon reduction, these ions are transformed into zero-valent gallium species, existing as supported gallium hydride oligomers or gallium-platinum bimetallic species. The formation of gallium-platinum bimetallic species on reduced Pt/Ga/BEA zeolites contributes to a decrease in the size of the platinum metal aggregates.

1. 向β沸石负载的铂（Pt/Ga/BEA）添加镓会导致生成的铂颗粒显著减小，通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）检测到。这种减少可以解释为铂颗粒表面被镓原子覆盖，可能伴随着间隙氢的存在，这阻止了铂团聚形成大颗粒。这种颗粒尺寸的减小降低了铂的加氢和氢解活性，并使Pt/Ga/沸石催化剂对焦炭失活的抵抗力降低。
2. Pt/Ga/BEA沸石中的镓物种在煅烧过程中经历变化。大多数三价镓离子转化为四面体配合物形式的孤立镓O4单位。在还原后，这些离子转化为零电荷的镓物种，以支持的镓氢化物寡聚体或镓-铂二元合金物种的形式存在。在还原后的Pt/Ga/BEA沸石上形成的镓-铂二元合金物种导致铂金属聚集物的尺寸减小。

1. The EXAFS and XANES spectra analysis revealed that during calcination, gallium(III) ions primarily transformed into isolated GaO4 units in a tetrahedral coordination, which were later reduced into zero-charge gallium species. These species exist as a supported gallium hydride oligomer or a gallium-platinum bimetallic species. The formation of a GaPt bimetallic species was confirmed through Pt L-edge EXAFS and contributed to a reduction in the size of Pt metal aggregates.

2. The decrease in the size of Pt aggregates can be attributed to the surface coverage of Pt particles by Ga atoms, along with the presence of interstitial hydrogen. This prevents the sintering of Pt aggregates into larger particles.

3. This reduction in size also decreases the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis activities of Pt, making Pt/Ga/zeolite less susceptible to coke deactivation.

4. These findings explain how the addition of Pt to Ga/zeolite enhances the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, with minimal impact on aromatization.

1. EXAFS和XANES谱分析表明，在煅烧过程中，大部分三价镓离子转化为四面体配合的孤立GaO4，并随后被还原为零电荷的镓物种。这些物种以支持的镓氢化寡聚体或镓-铂二元合金物种的形式存在。通过Pt L边EXAFS确认了在还原Pt/Ga/BEA沸石上形成的GaPt二元合金物种，并发现这导致了Pt金属团簇尺寸的减少。

2. 这种尺寸的减少可以归因于Pt颗粒表面覆盖着Ga原子，以及可能存在间隙氢。这阻止了Pt团簇聚集成为较大的颗粒。

3. 这种减小也降低了Pt的加氢和氢解活性，使得Pt/Ga/沸石更不易受到焦炭降解。

4. 这些结果解释了将Pt添加到Ga/沸石中如何促进烷烃的脱氢形成烯烃，而对芳构化几乎没有影响。
