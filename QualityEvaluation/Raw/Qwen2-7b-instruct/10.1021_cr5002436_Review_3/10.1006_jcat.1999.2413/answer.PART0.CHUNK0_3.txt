[1] "Compared with chromium- and platinum-based catalysts,molybdenum (49), vanadium (1012), palladium (13), zinc (14, 15), nickel (16), and gallium (17) compounds have been reported to be active in dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of magnesium increased the selectivity to n-butenes. The highest yield of n-butenes, 8%, was obtained after 5 min reduction with hydrogen for catalysts having a magnesium content of 34% and Mg : Mo molar ratio of approximately 1 : 1."
[3] "The selectivity to C4 alkenes was improved by modifying the catalyst with magnesium. The best yield of n-butenes,8%, was obtained with the Mg : Mo molar ratio of 1 : 1."
[4] "The activity of the molybdenum catalyst and its selectivity for dehydrogenation were substantially lower than the activity and selectivity of chromium oxide on alumina."

Research into vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved over decades, focusing on identifying catalysts that can achieve high activity and selectivity for the production of light alkenes. Factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Higher surface area supports often lead to better dispersion of the vanadium species, enhancing their activity. Metal loading affects the concentration of active sites, impacting both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Variables such as carrier type and metal loading can influence the redox properties of vanadium, affecting the types of reactions facilitated and the efficiency of product formation. The magnesium modification specifically improves the selectivity to n-butenes, achieving an 8% yield, which is optimal when the Mg : Mo molar ratio is approximately 1 : 1. This modification also reduces the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons, like benzene and toluene, contributing to a more balanced product distribution. However, despite these advancements, the activity and selectivity of vanadium oxide catalysts are generally lower than those of chromium oxide on alumina, indicating ongoing challenges in developing catalysts that match the performance of established materials.

自八十年代以来，研究范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品用于正构烷烃脱氢的领域不断发展，重点在于寻找既能实现高活性又能获得高选择性的催化剂，以生产轻质烯烃。影响这些催化剂中范德华物种性质和行为的因素包括载体类型、支撑面积以及金属负载量。较高的支撑表面面积往往能促进范德华物种的分散，从而增强其活性。金属负载量会影响活性中心的浓度，进而影响催化剂的活性与选择性。载体类型和金属负载量的变化可以影响范德华的还原性，从而影响所支持反应的类型及其效率。镁改性特别能提高异丁烯的选择性，达到8%的产率，最佳效果出现在镁：钼摩尔比约为1：1时。这种修改还能显著降低重烃如苯和甲苯的选择性，有助于实现更均衡的产品分布。然而，尽管取得了这些进展，范德华氧化物催化剂的活性和选择性仍然低于铝载体上的铬氧化物，这表明在开发性能与现有材料相匹敌的催化剂方面仍存在挑战。
