Box 310, FIN-06101 Porvoo, Finland Received September 8, 1998; revised December 21, 1998; accepted January 5, 1999 The catalytic properties of molybdenum oxide on alumina for the dehydrogenation of n-butane were studied at 560C under atmo- spheric pressure. The rapidity of the technique used to analyze the reaction product (Fourier transform infra red gas analysis) made it possible to measure the activity in dehydrogenation and the changes in the reduction level of the catalyst during the first minutes on stream. The highest activity was obtained with a molybdenum con- tent of 13%, which corresponds to a theoretical monolayer coverage on the γ -alumina. The oxidation state of the molybdenum active in the dehydrogenation was either Mo5+ or Mo4+. Some catalyst samples were modified with magnesium to improve the selectivity to n-butenes. The highest yield of n-butenes achieved, 8%, was ob- tained with a Mg : Mo molar ratio of 1 : 1. The best selectivity to C4 alkenes, 80%, was obtained with the highest content of magnesium,and was partly attributable to the formation of C4 alkenes via the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The active oxidation state of molybdenum for dehydrogenation was not stable under the condi- tions used for testing, but was reduced to lower oxidation states,resulting in an increased selectivity to n-butane cracking and coke formation. c 1999 Academic Press Key Words: dehydrogenation; n-butane; molybdenum oxide;molybdates; catalysis.
INTRODUCTION
The demand for light alkenes (C3C5) is expected to in- crease during the coming years, because these hydrocar- bons are essential building blocks of high-quality gasoline and diesel fuels and a variety of chemicals and polymers.
The main supplies at present, from catalytic cracking units (FCC) and steam cracking units, are not sufficient to meet future requirements. In an attempt to meet the demand, a number of dehydrogenation units have already been com- missioned. These units produce either isobutene (2-methyl propene) from isobutane to be used in MTBE (methyl tert.- butyl ether, 2-methoxy-2-methyl propane) production or propene from propane for polypropene production (1). 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

At this moment five dehydrogenation technologies are available for licensing, all of them relying on either chro- mium oxide or platinum catalysts (2). Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regenera- tion. Moreover, after regeneration a part of the chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ (3), which is carcinogenic.
The platinum catalysts, in turn, are expensive and sensitive to various impurities, so that the feed and recycle streams have to be purified carefully. Platinum-based catalysts are typically very complicated, containing several components to ensure the stability of platinum under the severe condi- tions of commercial operations (1). An improved catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins would clearly be welcome.
In addition to chromium- and platinum-based catalysts,molybdenum (49), vanadium (1012), palladium (13), zinc (14, 15), nickel (16), and gallium (17) compounds have been reported to be active in dehydrogenation. So far, however,none of these has performed at the activity and selectivity levels of the commercial catalysts.
Compared with chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide is far less harmful to the environment (18) and would be a feasible candidate to replace Cr. Molybdenum oxide on a silicon carbide carrier treated under reducing atmosphere has been shown to be active in dehydrogenation (4). The conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to C4 alkenes ob- tained at 550C were 20 and 80%, respectively. This catalyst also enhances the isomerization reaction of alkane at tem- peratures below 400C. Besides the oxides, molybdenum in sulfided form has exhibited activity for the dehydrogena- tion reaction, with a selectivity of 64% to propene (5). One disadvantage of the sulfided system is that sulfur oxides are released during the regeneration and new sulfur compound is needed for the reactivation. So far, the greatest study has been made of the molybdenum oxides for use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (19).
The aim of our study was to evaluate in detail the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide and estimate its poten- tial for dehydrogenation. The activity in dehydrogenation was measured and the reduction and oxidation states of molybdenum oxide on the catalysts were characterized by 0021-9517/99 $30.00 Copyright c 1999 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. 300 DEHYDROGENATION WITH Mo CATALYSTS 301 temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelec- tron spectroscopy.
EXPERIMENTAL
Preparation of the Catalyst Catalyst samples were prepared by incipient wetness im- pregnation on an alumina support. Prior to the impregna- tion, aluminum oxide extrudates (Akzo Nobel 000-1.5E) were crushed and sieved to a particle size of 0.30.5 mm and calcined at 600C for 16 h with 5% oxygen in nitrogen (Aga, O2 99.998%, N2 99.999%).
The impregnation of molybdenum was accomplished with an aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate,(NH4)6Mo7O24 · 4H2O (Merck, >99%). The pH of the mo- lybdenum solution was between 3 and 4. After the im- pregnation step the sample was dried at 120C for 8 h and calcinedat600Cfor6hina5%O2/N2mixture.Forcompar- ison one molybdenum catalyst was calcined for 6 h at 500C.
Some samples were modified with magnesium: before molybdenum impregnation the alumina support was impregnated with a solution of magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO3)2 · 6H2O (Merck, >99%). Drying and calcination steps were carried out in the same way as after the molyb- denum impregnation.
Characterization of the Catalyst The amounts of molybdenum and magnesium in the cata- lysts were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Surface areas and pore volumes of the catalysts were determined with a Coulter Omnisorp 100CX (static volumetric method). The crystalline structure of the cata- lysts was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with a Phillips PW diffractometer MDP 1880 using CuKα radi- ation.
The distribution of the metals in the support was stud- ied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy- dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The measurements were carried out with a JEOL JSM-840A scanning electron microscope equipped with a PGT Omega Light Element SiLi detector and fitted with IMIX version 6.860 software.
Before the measurement the catalyst particles were embed- ded in epoxy resin, and cross sections of particles were cut with a glass-knife microtome. The samples were coated with carbon to prevent charging under the electron beam.
The reduction of the catalysts was studied by tempera- ture-programmed reduction (TPR). The measurements were performed with an Altamira Instruments AMI-100 catalyst characterization system. The catalyst samples (50mg)weredriedat130Cfor60minwithhelium,calcined with 5% O2/He at 560C for 30 min, and cooled down to
30C. During the reduction the samples were heated from
30 to 560 or 700C at the rate of 5C/min under 10% H2 in argon (30 cm3/min) and kept at this temperature for 30 min.
The consumption of hydrogen was measured with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
To determine the oxidation states of molybdenum oxide on the catalysts some of the samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Before the mea- surement, the samples were reduced in the Altamira AMI- 100 system. The samples were dried under argon at 120C for 8 h, calcined in 5% O2/helium at 560C for 2 h, reduced in 5% H2/argon either at 560C for 0, 5, 30, or 120 min or at 700C for 120 min. After this, the samples were inertly transferred to a glove box and prepared for analysis under nitrogen atmosphere. Finally they were transferred to the XPS instrument under vacuum.
The XPS measurements were performed in an X-probe Model 101 spectrometer (Surface Science Instruments, VG Fisons) using a monochromatized AlKα X-ray source. A nickel grid and a flood gun were used to compensate sam- ple charging. The background pressure during acquisition was better than 1 × 106 Pa (1 × 108 Torr). High resolu- tionspectraofMo 3d,Al 2p,O 1s,C 1s,andMg 2sandalow- resolution survey spectrum were measured using a nominal spot size of 600 m. The Al 2p line (74.5 eV) was used as a binding energy reference. The overlapping Mo 3d signals were deconvoluted using symmetrical GaussianLorenzian (80/20) lines with the following constraints for all oxida- tion states: nonlinear Shirley background subtraction, Mo 3d5/2/Mo 3d3/2 intensity ratio of 1.45, and a doublet separa- tion (Mo 3d5/2Mo 3d3/2) of 3.13 eV.
Measurements of Catalyst Activity The activities of the catalysts were measured in a fixed- bed microreactor. A catalyst load of 0.5 g was placed in a quartz reactor, and the temperature was measured in the middle of the bed. The catalyst was heated to the reaction temperature under 5% oxygen flow (Aga, O2 99.5%, N2
99.999%) and the reactor was then flushed with nitrogen
(Aga, 99.999%) for 30 min before the first test at 560C.The nitrogen used was purified with an Oxisorb (Messer Griesheim). The activities of the catalysts were compared at 560C, at atmospheric pressure and with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 2 h1. The n-butane feed (Aga,
99.95%) was diluted with nitrogen, the molar ratio of nitro-
gen to n-butane being 9 : 1. Before some of the activity tests,the catalyst was reduced at 560C with 5% hydrogen (Aga,
99.999%) for 5 or 30 min. Several reaction cycles could be
performed with the same catalyst sample by regenerating the catalyst with diluted air between the cycles.
The products were analyzed with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.). The spectra were measured in the wavenumber range 8504000 cm1 with a resolution of 8 cm1 at a scanning rate of10scans/s.Thecuvette(9cm3)wasmaintainedatconstant 302

temperature (175C) and pressure (103 kPa). The analyzer was calibrated with pure compounds diluted with nitro- gen: methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, i-butane,i-butene, n-butane, 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene,1,3-butadiene, CO, CO2, benzene, toluene, and water. The residuals in the fitting of the sample spectra with the set of calibration spectra were less than 5% of the sample spec- tra. The method of analyzing the reaction product has been discussed in detail elsewhere (20).
The amounts of water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide formed in the reaction or during the reduction were measured, and the average oxidation state of molybdenum was calculated. It was possible to measure the amount of carbon oxides released during regeneration and to estimate the coke content of the catalyst.
The conversion and selectivity were calculated from the reaction product on the basis of the carbon balance: the total molar amount of carbon in the effluent was assumed to be equal to the molar amount of carbon in the n-butane fed to the reactor. The coke formed on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation test was usually neglected, but in some calculations the coke was included in the carbon balance.

RESULTS
Catalysts The catalysts tested in the dehydrogenation of n-butane are listed in Table 1. The catalysts are designated according to the calculated amount of molybdenum impregnated on thecatalyst.TheamountofmolybdenummeasuredbyAAS is shown in Table 1. Assuming that a theoretical monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on alumina equals 5 Mo atoms/nm2 (21, 22), the amount of 724 wt% Mo would equal 0.52 geometrical monolayers. After molybdenum impregnation all catalysts were calcined for 6 h at 600C,except Mo13/500C, which was calcined at 500C.
The catalyst Mo13 was modified with 0.88.4 wt% mag- nesium to decrease the acidity of the alumina carrier and improve the selectivity to C4 alkenes. The magnesium- modified catalysts are designated according to the molar ratio of the measured amount of magnesium to the mea- sured amount of molybdenum in the catalyst; thus, the cata- lyst Mo13Mg0.8 contains magnesium with a molar ratio of magnesium to molybdenum of 0.8.
Table 1 also reports the surface area and total pore vol- ume of the catalysts. When surface areas are calculated rel- ative to the fraction of the alumina carrier of the catalysts, it can be seen that the addition of magnesium and 7 or 13 wt% molybdenum has little effect on the surface area. From this it can be assumed that the oxides were well dispersed on the support. The addition of 24% molybdenum, in turn, re- sulted in a decrease of 13% in the surface area of alumina,possibly due to blocking of pores during the formation of MoO3 crystallites.
X-ray diffractograms of the molybdenum catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. Sample Mo13 contained crystalline MoO3 when calcined at 500C (Fig. 1a), but crystallites of

FIG. 3.
TPR profiles of the catalysts to 700C.
Oxidation States of Molybdenum The TPR profiles of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. The TPR pattern of catalyst Mo13/600 contained two maxima:one at 422C and the other at 556C. The first maximum is related to the partial reduction of octahedrally coordinated molybdenum species in multilayers (2326), while the sec- ond is related to the reduction of Al2(MoO4)3 (25, 27). The new maximum in the TPR pattern of catalyst Mo24 indi- cates the reduction of crystalline MoO3 at 495C, as also reported by L opez Cordero et al. (23).
The TPR profiles of the catalysts containing both molyb- denum and magnesium exhibited basically one maximum.
The temperature of this maximum increased with mag- nesium content, from 462C for a magnesium content of
0.8% (Mo13Mg0.2) to 544C for a magnesium content of
8% (Mo13Mg2.9). The maximum is evidently composed of at least two peaks, which are related to the reduction of MgMoO4 and molybdenum oxide species. The smaller peak at 607C in the profile of Mo13Mg0.8 (see Fig. 3) may be related to the small amount of Al2(MoO4)3 that was seen in the X-ray diffractogram.
The hydrogen consumption of the magnesium-con- taining catalysts was measured during temperature-pro- grammed reduction between 30 and 560C and is presented in Table 2. The average oxidation state of molybdenum species was calculated on the basis of hydrogen consump- tion by assuming that the fresh catalyst was totally in the oxidation state Mo6+ and that 1 mol of hydrogen consumed would mean the reduction of 1 mol of Mo6+ to Mo4+. The average oxidation state was between +3.7 and +3.9 for all the catalysts containing 13% molybdenum.
To study the oxidation states of Mo on the Mo13Mg0.8 catalyst in detail, XPS was performed after calcination in air at 560C and after reduction of 5, 30, and 120 min at 560C.
A reduction for 120 min at 700C was also performed to reduce part of the molybdenum to its metallic state. The Mo 3d spectra are presented in Fig. 4 and an example of the peak deconvolution is shown in Fig. 5. Table 3 summarizes the results of the peak fitting. The three Mo 3d doublets with the highest binding energies (Mo 3d5/2 at 233.0, 231.9, and
230.0 eV) correspond to the oxidation states Mo6+ [MoO3,
Al2(MoO4)3- or MgMoO4-like species], Mo5+, and isolated Mo4+ (2831), respectively. The interpretation of the fourth doublet with a mean binding energy value of 228.9 eV is more speculative, it being either a paired double-bonded Mo4+ (rutile MoO2) (32) or some oxidation state below Mo4+ (24, 28, 29, 33, 34). The average oxidation state cal- culated after 30 min reduction at 560C was 4.3, 3.9, or
3.4 depending on whether the lowest oxidation state was
Mo4+, Mo3+, or Mo2+, respectively. These calculations and the TPR results indicate that on the catalyst surface a part of molybdenum has an oxidation state below Mo4+. Af- ter reduction at 700C the signals characteristic of metallic molybdenum appeared with the binding energy of Mo 3d5/2 at 227.7 eV (28, 29, 35).

The activity decreased during the first 3 min on stream, and the formation of C1C3 products was reduced.
The conversions obtained with the MoOx/alumina sam- ples are shown in Fig. 6. The highest activity, where the con- version was 24% after 2 min on stream, was obtained with catalyst Mo13, which contained an amount of molybdenum closelycorrespondingtoatheoreticalmonolayeronthealu- mina surface. The selectivity to all C4 alkenes was only 49%,including the selectivity of 29% to n-butenes. The selectiv- ity to C1C3 hydrocarbons was 28%. The coke formed on the catalyst was not included in these calculations.
The product distribution in the test of Mo13 is shown in Fig. 7. The formation of CO, CO2, and water during the first

The maximum yield of n-butenes,7%, was obtained after 2 min on stream. The yield of 1,3- butadiene, approximately 4%, was highest during the first minute on stream and it decreased rapidly to 2%. The yields of C1C3 hydrocarbons and i-butene increased to maxima of 7 and 3%, respectively, after 2 min on stream.
To increase the selectivity to n-butenes, the acidity of the alumina support was decreased by adding some magnesium (36, 37). The activity of the Mg/alumina sample was low,giving a conversion of n-butane less than 4% (Fig. 8). The main products formed were n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene,with a selectivity of 70%. No carbon oxides or i-butene was formed.
The activities of catalysts containing both molybdenum and magnesium during 10 min on stream are presented in Fig. 8. The conversion of n-butane decreased from 24 to 1015% with the addition of magnesium. The conversion of n-butane and the selectivities after 2 min on stream are shown in Fig. 9. The magnesium increased the selectivity to all C4 alkenes and lowered the selectivity to C1C3 hydro- carbons. The selectivity to C4 alkenes was highest (approx- imately 80%) for the catalyst containing 8% magnesium (Mo13Mg2.9).
The selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons, benzene and toluene, decreased with the addition of magnesium. For catalysts Mo13 and Mo13Mg2.9 the selectivities were 16 and 2%, respectively. The amount of coke formed on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation test followed the same trend, decreasing for the two catalysts from 3.1 to 0.3% (Table 4). If this coke formation were included in the car- bon balance when calculating the catalyst activities, the conversion of n-butane would be higher and the selectivity to C4 alkenes lower than those values presented in Fig. 9 (Table 4).

Activity with Reduced Molybdenum Oxide Catalysts To study the activity of the different oxidation states of molybdenum, the catalysts were reduced with hydrogen for 5 or 30 min before an activity test with n-butane. The re- sults reported in Table 5 for catalysts Mo13 and Mo13Mg0.8 were obtained after 1 min on n-butane stream. For catalyst Mo13, the conversion of n-butane increased from 21 to 31 and 38% after prereductions of 5 and 30 min, respectively,while the selectivities to all C4 alkenes decreased from 49 to 36 and 24%. After calcination the conversion of n-butane

After calcination the selectiv- ity to all C4 alkenes was more or less stable at 50%, but the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene decreased and the selec- tivity to n-butenes increased with time. After a prereduc- tion of 30 min the selectivity to C4 alkenes increased from 24 to 38% and the selectivity to C1C3 hydrocarbons de- creased from 40 to 31%. The amount of coke formed on the catalysts during the test period increased when the cata- lysts were reduced with hydrogen before the test (Table 6),308

During the activity test with n-butane, the reduction of molybdenum species was followed with a FTIR gas ana- lyzer by measuring the oxygen compounds released from the catalyst. The assumptions made were that all the oxy- gen released originated from the catalyst, the molybdenum species on the fresh catalyst was completely in the Mo6+ state, and 1 mol of water, 1 mol of carbon monoxide or
0.5 mol of carbon dioxide released corresponded to the re-

In the calculation for hydrogen prereductions, the water and carbon oxides formed were divided into two parts. The first part is the amount of water detected during the reduction of the catalyst with hydrogen and the other is the water and carbon oxides released during the following activity test with n-butane. After 5 min hydrogen reduction, car-

11 74 11 bon dioxide was still formed under n-butane flow, indicat- ing the further reduction of the molybdenum compounds.
After hydrogen reduction of 30 min the oxidation state of the molybdenum species is assumed to be more or less sta- ble, because during the following activity test hardly any carbon dioxide is formed. The water and carbon monoxide detected under n-butane flow were assumed to be formed mainly because of the retention of hydrogen in the catalyst during the previous hydrogen reduction (38).
After 10 min on n-butane stream the average oxidation state of catalyst Mo13 was close to the value obtained after reduction with hydrogen for 5 min and with n-butane for 5 min. The same was observed for Mo24. The oxidation state of the magnesium-containing catalyst Mo13Mg0.8 was slightly lower than that without magnesium modification (Table 7).
To study the reduction of molybdenum compounds in detail, the formation of water is presented separately.
Figure 10a shows the cumulative amount of water formed (A) during the activity test of catalyst Mo13. The amount of water assumed to be formed via reduction of molyb- denum compounds with n-butane is presented with curve
B. Curve B was calculated from carbon oxides released
during reduction according to the following stoichiometry: C4H10 + (2x + 5/2)O2 = 4COx + 5H2O. It is clear that the total amount of water detected during the activity test was higher than expected from reaction B and that the differ- encebetweenthecurvesdecreasedduringthetest.Forcom- parison, Fig. 10b shows that the amount of water released (A) after 5 min hydrogen prereduction was significantly lower than without the prereduction. In this case it is not possible to estimate the amount of water formed due to the catalyst reduction (B) because of hydrogen retention in DEHYDROGENATION WITH Mo CATALYSTS 309

With catalysts containing both molybdenum and mag- nesium, the difference between curves A and B increased.
The amount of carbon oxides released decreased and the amountofwaterformationincreasedwithmagnesiummod- ification. However, the average oxidation state of molyb- denum compounds calculated from the total amount of wa- ter and carbon oxides released during 10 min on n-butane stream was between 4.4 and 4.7 for all the catalysts contain- ing 13% molybdenum.
Also, the ratio between 1,3-butadiene and n-butenes in- creased with magnesium modification. For catalysts Mo13, Mo13Mg0.8, and Mo13Mg2.9 this ratio was 0.5, 1.7, and
2.6 mol/mol, respectively, after 1 min on n-butane stream.
After 30 min hydrogen reduction this ratio was 0.2, 0.2, and
0.5 mol/mol, respectively, for the same catalysts.
DISCUSSION
The reduction of molybdenum oxide on different sup- ports has been studied widely, since reduction is essential during transformation of the oxide precursor to the sulfidic state (39). In most of these studies the temperature dur-

ing calcination of the catalyst was below 550C. We carried out calcination at 600C because owing to thermodynamic limitations the temperature of the endothermic dehydro- genation reaction has to be above 550C. Above 600C,dehydrogenation selectivity diminishes due to thermal re- actions.
With high molybdenum content, Al2(MoO4)3 crystallites areformedduringcalcinationat550600C(23,4044).Ac- cording to XRD, sample Mo13 contained crystalline MoO3 after calcination at 500C, but Al2(MoO4)3 crystallites were formed at 600C. These crystalline structures are typical of molybdenum loadings higher than the monolayer capacity of the alumina surface, but also around and even below the theoretical monolayer coverage (22, 45). After calcina- tion at 600C, MoO3 crystallites are typically found only at higher molybdenum contents, as noted in our study with catalyst Mo24.
The average oxidation state of molybdenum obtained after reduction of the catalyst increased in the order Mo24 < Mo13 < Mo7 (Table 7). It is known that the reduc- tion of molybdenum species on alumina is more difficult at low loadings (23). The molybdenum compounds in catalysts Mo13 were reduced, on average, to the same oxidation state both with n-butane (10 min) and with hydrogen/n-butane (5 + 5 min) reduction. The average oxidation state obtained after 30 min reduction with hydrogen (4.3) was close to the value of 3.9 obtained after TPR measurement (Table 2).

Influence of Magnesium Addition Addition of magnesium to an amount Mg : Mo 1 : 1 mol/ mol before impregnation of molybdenum prevented the formation of crystalline Al2(MoO4)3. Instead, molybdenum and magnesium reacted to MgMoO4 during the calcina- tion at 600C. These observations agree well with the re- sults of Abello et al. (46) and Vrieland and Murchison (47).
According to TPR results the differences in the extent of reduction of the catalysts containing 13% molybdenum and 0 to 8% magnesium were small: the molybdenum species were reduced to an average oxidation state between +3.7 and +3.9 at 560C. The reduction of the molybdenum DEHYDROGENATION WITH Mo CATALYSTS 311 species took place at higher temperatures in the presence of magnesium. This can be partly due to the formation of crystalline MgMoO4, but also the octahedrally coordinated molybdenum species and crystalline Al2(MoO4)3 were re- duced at higher temperatures. Mulcahy et al. (37) have shown that the modification of alumina with magnesium leads to an increase in the basicity of the support and in the number of hydroxyl groups and to increased dispersion of the molybdenum species. This could be one reason for higher reduction temperatures. Although the differences in the oxidation state were small, the lowest oxidation state was observed with catalysts Mo13Mg0.8 and Mo13Mg1.2,where the molar Mg : Mo ratio was close to 1 : 1. This ob- servation was supported by the results obtained with the FTIR gas analyzer (Table 7).
The average oxidation states of molybdenum compounds obtained for catalyst Mo13Mg0.8 with different methods (TPR, FTIR, and XPS) were very close: the values mea- sured after 30 min hydrogen reduction were 3.7 and 4.0 with TPR and FTIR, respectively, and 3.9 or 3.4 with XPS depending on the lowest oxidation state of molybdenum used in the calculation.
Active Sites The activity of the alumina support under the conditions studied is most likely attributable to the acidic sites. The formation of cracked hydrocarbons from n-butane at these sites took place mostly during the first minutes on stream.
The magnesium impregnated on the catalyst presumably also reacted with these sites, as seen in the much lower ac- tivity of the Mg/alumina than the alumina sample. In addi- tion, the amount of coke formed on the Mg/alumina catalyst surface during the n-butane feed of 10 min was 1/20th what it was on alumina.
Two features were evident in the results of the activity tests. First, during the tests the molybdenum species were reduced by the hydrocarbons to lower oxidation states,with effects on both conversion and selectivity. Second, the yields of the various products decreased with time on n- butane stream at different rates. These features can be dis- tinguished by comparing the results of the activity tests with and without the hydrogen reduction prior to the test. The possible influence of coke on the activity of the catalysts cannot be ruled out after several minutes on stream; there- fore, we have concentrated our study on the initial activity of the catalysts.
When no prereduction with hydrogen was applied the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene was highest with every cata- lyst during the first minute on stream. During the same first minute, the yield of n-butenes increased to a maxi- mum value and decreased slowly. After reduction with hy- drogen the yield of 1,3-butadiene was low but stable dur- ing the 10-min test, and the yield of n-butenes remained high.
Comparison of the stoichiometric amounts of carbon ox- ides and water formed due to the reduction by the hydrocar- bon and the total amount of water formed (Fig. 10a) during the activity test led us to conclude that part of the C4 alkenes was formed by oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The products formed via this reaction were 1,3-butadiene and water or n-butenes and water. During the first 4 min on n-butane stream, some other products were also formed from oxidative dehydrogenation; for example, the amount of benzene detected in the product was high during the first minutes.
After calcination the oxidation state of molybdenum was Mo6+. The first products formed were carbon oxides and water. About 20 s later, C4 alkenes and water (Difference, Fig. 10a) were detected in the product. The active species for oxidative dehydrogenation was most likely a reduced oxidation state of molybdenum, Mo5+ or Mo4+, or a com- bination of the reduced oxidation state and Mo6+ (46, 47).
During the test the rate of oxidative dehydrogenation de- creased rapidly because of the limited amount of labile oxy- gen available on the catalyst (47). This interpretation is sup- ported by the considerably lower yields of 1,3-butadiene and water obtained after the hydrogen prereduction.
After 5 min of hydrogen reduction (Fig. 10b), small amounts of water were formed by the further reduction of thecatalystbyn-butanefeed;atthesametimetheyieldof n- butenes remained high. It was therefore, concluded, that at this stage n-butenes were formed via the dehydrogenation reaction, the products being n-butenes or 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen. Because the dehydrogenation activity also re- mained quite high after 30 min of H2 reduction, the oxi- dation state Mo5+ or Mo4+ was most likely active in the dehydrogenation reaction.
The conversion of n-butane with the calcined catalyst Mo13 (Fig. 8) decreased slowly during the 10-min activity test. The conversion was higher after the prereductions but the activity declined fast. Since after 30 min prereduction the change in the average oxidation state during the test was minor, we concluded that this rapid decrease in activ- ity was due to coke formation. After the 10-min test period (Table 6) the amount of coke was noticeably higher on the reduced than on the calcined catalyst. The yields of C1C3 hydrocarbons followed the same trend as the coke forma- tion: they were very low on the fresh catalyst and increased during the reduction of the catalyst with hydrocarbon and after the reduction with hydrogen. Several oxidation states could serve as the active sites for these reactions (Mo5+, Mo4+, Mo3+/2+), but according to our results the most ac- tive would seem to be the lowest oxidation state, Mo3+/2+.
During the reduction of molybdenum species the MoO Al bonds are broken, the alumina surface is uncovered, and the acidity of the catalyst surface is changed (22, 42, 48, 49).
This, in turn, could lead to an increase in the selectivity to the cracked products and in coke formation on alumina. 312
HARLIN ET AL.
Due to coke formation, however, the activity of the sites rapidly declines.
No i-butane was formed as a product of isomerization, so i-butene was assumed to be formed mainly through isomer- ization ofn-butenes.The ratiooftheyieldofi-butenetothat of n-butenes was between 0.2 and 0.4. The ratio increased after reduction with hydrogen and decreased with catalysts containing more molybdenum. These changes could be due to the differences in the acidic character of the catalyst sam- ples (49).
Influence of Magnesium on Activity The addition of magnesium increased the selectivity to n- butenes. The highest yield of n-butenes, 8%, was obtained after 5 min reduction with hydrogen for catalysts having a magnesium content of 34% and Mg : Mo molar ratio of ap- proximately 1 : 1. Furthermore, the addition of magnesium reduced substantially the selectivity to heavier hydrocar- bons, benzene and toluene. The amount of coke formed on the catalyst after calcination decreased from 3.1 to 0.3 wt% with the addition of 8 wt% magnesium. These observations can be explained by the reducing effect of magnesium on the acidity of the catalysts.
The magnesium modification also affected the reduc- tion route of the catalysts. The molybdenum compounds were reduced with n-butane partly via a slow oxidative dehydrogenation reaction and partly via a reduction to carbon oxides and water. The selectivity toward oxidative dehydrogenation increased with magnesium addition. The average oxidation state of molybdenum compounds was,however, roughly the same after 10 min of n-butane inde- pendent of the magnesium content.
CONCLUSIONS
From the results of this study, we conclude that the ac- tive oxidation state of molybdenum for the dehydrogena- tion reaction is either Mo5+ or Mo4+. This oxidation state was formed during reduction of molybdenum Mo6+ by hy- drogen or by n-butane. However, this active oxidation state was not stable on the alumina carrier under the conditions used for testing, and the molybdenum compounds were re- duced further to the lower oxidation states that were active in cracking of n-butane and coke formation.
The selectivity to C4 alkenes was improved by modifying the catalyst with magnesium. The best yield of n-butenes,8%, was obtained with the Mg : Mo molar ratio of 1 : 1. The highest selectivitytoC4alkenes,80%,wasobtainedwiththe highest amount of magnesium, because the selectivity was increased due to the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.
The activity of the molybdenum catalyst and its selec- tivity for dehydrogenation were substantially lower than the activity and selectivity of chromium oxide on alumina.
With chromium catalysts, the selectivity to C4 alkenes is approximately 95% and the selectivities for oxidative de- hydrogenation and isomerization are small.
