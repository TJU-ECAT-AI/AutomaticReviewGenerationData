[1] "Compared with chromium- and platinum-based catalysts,molybdenum (49), vanadium (1012), palladium (13), zinc (14, 15), nickel (16), and gallium (17) compounds have been reported to be active in dehydrogenation."
[2] "So far, however,none of these has performed at the activity and selectivity levels of the commercial catalysts."
[3] "The selectivity to C4 alkenes was only 49%,including the selectivity of 29% to n-butenes."
[4] "The addition of magnesium increased the selectivity to n-butenes."
[5] "The highest yield of n-butenes,8%, was obtained with the Mg : Mo molar ratio of 1 : 1."
[6] "The addition of magnesium reduced substantially the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons, benzene and toluene."

1. Research in vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for more environmentally friendly and cost-effective catalysts. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on optimizing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts by adjusting factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.

2. Variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of the vanadium species on the catalyst surface, impacting reactivity and stability. Surface area influences the amount of active site available for reactions, potentially affecting selectivity and activity. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium on the catalyst, impacting both the activity and selectivity towards desired products.

3. The selectivity to C4 alkenes, particularly n-butenes, has been improved by modifying the catalyst with magnesium. The highest yield of n-butenes (8%) was achieved with a Mg : Mo molar ratio of 1 : 1. This modification also reduces the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons like benzene and toluene.

1. 作为Pt和CrOx的替代品，用于正构烷烃脱氢的研究，主要是为了寻找更环保、成本效益更高的催化剂。自1980年代以来，研究集中在通过调整载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量优化这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为上。

2. 载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量影响了钒氧化物基催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。载体类型影响催化剂表面的钒物种分散性，进而影响反应活性和稳定性。表面面积决定了活性位点的数量，可能影响选择性和活性。金属负载决定了催化剂上的钒浓度，直接影响对所需产品的活性和选择性。

3. 添加镁可以提高催化剂对C4烯烃，特别是异丁烯的选择性。在镁与钼摩尔比为1:1的情况下，最高得到的异丁烯产率为8%。这种修改还显著降低了对较重的烃类如苯和甲苯的选择性。
