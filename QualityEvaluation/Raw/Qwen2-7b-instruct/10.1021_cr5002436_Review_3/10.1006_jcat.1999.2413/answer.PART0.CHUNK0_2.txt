[1] "Compared with chromium- and platinum-based catalysts,molybdenum (49), vanadium (1012), palladium (13), zinc (14, 15), nickel (16), and gallium (17) compounds have been reported to be active in dehydrogenation."
[2] "The aim of our study was to evaluate in detail the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide and estimate its potential for dehydrogenation."
[3] "In an attempt to meet the demand, a number of dehydrogenation units have already been com- missioned. These units produce either isobutene (2-methyl propene) from isobutane to be used in MTBE (methyl tert.- butyl ether, 2-methoxy-2-methyl propane) production or propene from propane for polypropene production (1)."
[4] "One disadvantage of the sulfided system is that sulfur oxides are released during the regeneration and new sulfur compound is needed for the reactivation."
[5] "The selectivity to C4 alkenes was only 49%,including the selectivity of 29% to n-butenes."
[6] "The activity of the Mg/alumina sample was low,giving a conversion of n-butane less than 4% (Fig. 8)."
[7] "The selectivity to C4 alkenes was highest (approx- imately 80%) for the catalyst containing 8% magnesium (Mo13Mg2.9)."
[8] "The addition of magnesium increased the selectivity to n- butenes. The highest yield of n-butenes,8%, was obtained after 5 min reduction with hydrogen for catalysts having a magnesium content of 34% and Mg : Mo molar ratio of ap- proximately 1 : 1."

1. Molybdenum, vanadium, palladium, zinc, nickel, and gallium compounds have been reported to be active in dehydrogenation processes. 
2. The objective of the study was to thoroughly assess the catalytic capabilities of molybdenum oxide and estimate its potential for dehydrogenation applications.
3. To address the growing demand, multiple dehydrogenation units have been installed, producing either isobutene from isobutane for MTBE production or propene from propane for polypropene production.
4. A significant drawback of the sulfided system is the emission of sulfur oxides during regeneration, necessitating the introduction of a new sulfur compound for reactivation.
5. With catalyst Mo13, the selectivity towards C4 alkenes was 49%, including a 29% selectivity for n-butenes.
6. The Mg/alumina catalyst displayed a low conversion rate of n-butane, yielding less than 4% conversion.
7. The catalyst with 8% magnesium showed the highest selectivity for C4 alkenes, reaching approximately 80%.
8. The incorporation of magnesium enhanced the selectivity for n-butanes, achieving an 8% yield after a 5-minute hydrogen reduction period.

1. 钼、钒、钯、锌、镍和镓化合物已被报道在脱氢过程中活性。
2. 研究的目标是详细评估钼氧化物的催化性能并估算其脱氢潜力。
3. 为了满足需求，已经安装了多个脱氢单元，用于从异丁烷制备MTBE（甲基叔丁基醚）或从丙烷制备聚丙烯。
4. 硫化系统的缺点是在再生过程中会释放硫氧化物，需要引入新的硫化合物进行重新激活。
5. 使用催化剂Mo13时，C4烯烃的选择性为49%，其中n-丁烯的选择性为29%。
6. Mg/alumina催化剂的n-丁烷转化率极低，低于4%。
7. 含有8%镁的催化剂显示出最高的C4烯烃选择性，达到约80%。
8. 添加镁提高了n-丁烯的选择性，并在5分钟氢气还原后获得了8%的产率。
