The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for more environmentally friendly catalysts with comparable performance. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s with a focus on understanding how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The study aimed to evaluate the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide in detail and estimate its potential for dehydrogenation, focusing on the conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to C4 alkenes. High selectivity to C4 alkenes (80%) was achieved with the highest content of magnesium, partly attributed to oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the active oxidation state of molybdenum for dehydrogenation was not stable, leading to increased selectivity to n-butane cracking and coke formation.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品进行烷烃脱氢的研究，旨在寻找更环保且性能相近的催化剂。自1980年代以来，研究领域已经发展，着重于载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。研究目标是详细评估钼氧化物的催化性能，并估计其在脱氢方面的潜力，重点关注n-丁烷的转化和C4烯烃的选择性。实现80%的C4烯烃选择性需要最高含量的镁，部分归因于氧化脱氢反应。然而，钼在测试条件下的活性氧化态不稳定，导致n-丁烷裂解和焦炭形成的选择性增加。

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts were explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their potential environmental benefits over chromium oxide catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the optimization of catalyst composition and structure to enhance activity and selectivity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The activity of molybdenum catalysts and their selectivity for dehydrogenation were found to be lower than those of chromium oxide catalysts. The selectivity to C4 alkenes was improved by modifying the catalyst with magnesium, achieving a yield of 8% n-butenes and an 80% selectivity to C4 alkenes with the highest magnesium content. This was attributed to the reducing effect of magnesium on the acidity of the catalysts and the enhanced oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

3. The addition of magnesium increased the selectivity to n-butenes and reduced the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene. The amount of coke formed on the catalyst after calcination decreased significantly with the addition of magnesium, from 3.1 wt% to 0.3 wt%. This suggests that magnesium modification can enhance the catalytic properties of molybdenum catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 钒氧化物基催化剂被探索用作铂和CrOx的替代品进行烷烃脱氢，主要是由于它们在环境友好性方面优于铬氧化物催化剂。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，着重于优化催化剂组成和结构以提高活性和选择性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为有显著影响。

2. 钼催化剂的活性和脱氢选择性低于铬氧化物催化剂。通过添加镁可以提高钼催化剂的脱氢选择性，最高可获得8%的丁烯产率和80%的C4烯烃选择性。这归因于镁对催化剂酸性的减少作用以及增强的氧化脱氢反应。

3. 添加镁增加了丁烯的选择性，并减少了苯和甲苯等重碳氢化合物的选择性。经过煅烧后催化剂上的焦炭形成量从3.1 wt%降低到0.3 wt%，显著减少。这表明，镁改性可以增强钼催化剂的脱氢反应性能。

Research into vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved over decades, focusing on identifying catalysts that can achieve high activity and selectivity for the production of light alkenes. Factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Higher surface area supports often lead to better dispersion of the vanadium species, enhancing their activity. Metal loading affects the concentration of active sites, impacting both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Variables such as carrier type and metal loading can influence the redox properties of vanadium, affecting the types of reactions facilitated and the efficiency of product formation. The magnesium modification specifically improves the selectivity to n-butenes, achieving an 8% yield, which is optimal when the Mg : Mo molar ratio is approximately 1 : 1. This modification also reduces the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons, like benzene and toluene, contributing to a more balanced product distribution. However, despite these advancements, the activity and selectivity of vanadium oxide catalysts are generally lower than those of chromium oxide on alumina, indicating ongoing challenges in developing catalysts that match the performance of established materials.

1. Research in vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for more environmentally friendly and cost-effective catalysts. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on optimizing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts by adjusting factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.

2. Variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of the vanadium species on the catalyst surface, impacting reactivity and stability. Surface area influences the amount of active site available for reactions, potentially affecting selectivity and activity. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium on the catalyst, impacting both the activity and selectivity towards desired products.

3. The selectivity to C4 alkenes, particularly n-butenes, has been improved by modifying the catalyst with magnesium. The highest yield of n-butenes (8%) was achieved with a Mg : Mo molar ratio of 1 : 1. This modification also reduces the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons like benzene and toluene.
