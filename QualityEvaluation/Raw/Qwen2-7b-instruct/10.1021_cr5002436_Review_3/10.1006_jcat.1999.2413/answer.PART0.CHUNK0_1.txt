[1] "Compared with chromium- and platinum-based catalysts,molybdenum (49), vanadium (1012), palladium (13), zinc (14, 15), nickel (16), and gallium (17) compounds have been reported to be active in dehydrogenation."
[2] "So far, none of these has performed at the activity and selectivity levels of the commercial catalysts."
[3] "One disadvantage of the sulfided system is that sulfur oxides are released during the regeneration and new sulfur compound is needed for the reactivation."
[4] "Besides the oxides, molybdenum in sulfided form has exhibited activity for the dehydrogenation reaction, with a selectivity of 64% to propene."
[5] "The greatest study has been made of the molybdenum oxides for use in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (19)."
[6] "The addition of magnesium increased the selectivity to n-butenes."
[7] "The highest yield of n-butenes, 8%, was obtained after 5 min reduction with hydrogen for catalysts having a magnesium content of 34% and Mg : Mo molar ratio of approximately 1 : 1."
[8] "Furthermore, the addition of magnesium reduced substantially the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons, benzene and toluene."
[9] "The amount of coke formed on the catalyst after calcination decreased from 3.1 to 0.3 wt% with the addition of 8 wt% magnesium."

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts were explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their potential environmental benefits over chromium oxide catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the optimization of catalyst composition and structure to enhance activity and selectivity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The activity of molybdenum catalysts and their selectivity for dehydrogenation were found to be lower than those of chromium oxide catalysts. The selectivity to C4 alkenes was improved by modifying the catalyst with magnesium, achieving a yield of 8% n-butenes and an 80% selectivity to C4 alkenes with the highest magnesium content. This was attributed to the reducing effect of magnesium on the acidity of the catalysts and the enhanced oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

3. The addition of magnesium increased the selectivity to n-butenes and reduced the selectivity to heavier hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene. The amount of coke formed on the catalyst after calcination decreased significantly with the addition of magnesium, from 3.1 wt% to 0.3 wt%. This suggests that magnesium modification can enhance the catalytic properties of molybdenum catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 钒氧化物基催化剂被探索用作铂和CrOx的替代品进行烷烃脱氢，主要是由于它们在环境友好性方面优于铬氧化物催化剂。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，着重于优化催化剂组成和结构以提高活性和选择性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为有显著影响。

2. 钼催化剂的活性和脱氢选择性低于铬氧化物催化剂。通过添加镁可以提高钼催化剂的脱氢选择性，最高可获得8%的丁烯产率和80%的C4烯烃选择性。这归因于镁对催化剂酸性的减少作用以及增强的氧化脱氢反应。

3. 添加镁增加了丁烯的选择性，并减少了苯和甲苯等重碳氢化合物的选择性。经过煅烧后催化剂上的焦炭形成量从3.1 wt%降低到0.3 wt%，显著减少。这表明，镁改性可以增强钼催化剂的脱氢反应性能。
