[1] "The demand for light alkenes (C3C5) is expected to increase during the coming years, because these hydrocarbons are essential building blocks of high-quality gasoline and diesel fuels and a variety of chemicals and polymers."
[2] "So far, however,none of these has performed at the activity and selectivity levels of the commercial catalysts."
[3] "Compared with chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide is far less harmful to the environment (18) and would be a feasible candidate to replace Cr."
[4] "The aim of our study was to evaluate in detail the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide and estimate its potential for dehydrogenation."
[5] "The activity in dehydrogenation was measured and the reduction and oxidation states of molybdenum oxide on the catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[6] "The conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to C4 alkenes obtained at 550C were 20 and 80%, respectively."
[7] "The highest yield of n-butenes achieved, 8%, was obtained with a Mg : Mo molar ratio of 1 : 1."
[8] "The best selectivity to C4 alkenes, 80%, was obtained with the highest content of magnesium, and was partly attributable to the formation of C4 alkenes via the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[9] "The active oxidation state of molybdenum for dehydrogenation was not stable under the conditions used for testing, but was reduced to lower oxidation states,resulting in an increased selectivity to n-butane cracking and coke formation."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for more environmentally friendly catalysts with comparable performance. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s with a focus on understanding how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The study aimed to evaluate the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide in detail and estimate its potential for dehydrogenation, focusing on the conversion of n-butane and the selectivity to C4 alkenes. High selectivity to C4 alkenes (80%) was achieved with the highest content of magnesium, partly attributed to oxidative dehydrogenation. However, the active oxidation state of molybdenum for dehydrogenation was not stable, leading to increased selectivity to n-butane cracking and coke formation.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品进行烷烃脱氢的研究，旨在寻找更环保且性能相近的催化剂。自1980年代以来，研究领域已经发展，着重于载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。研究目标是详细评估钼氧化物的催化性能，并估计其在脱氢方面的潜力，重点关注n-丁烷的转化和C4烯烃的选择性。实现80%的C4烯烃选择性需要最高含量的镁，部分归因于氧化脱氢反应。然而，钼在测试条件下的活性氧化态不稳定，导致n-丁烷裂解和焦炭形成的选择性增加。
