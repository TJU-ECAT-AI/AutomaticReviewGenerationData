<p>The dehydrogenation of n-butane over PdGa/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied to enhance the selectivity towards propylene. The catalysts were prepared by impregnation with aqueous solutions of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3, and characterized by various methods including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, N2 adsorption, temperature programmed reduction, CO and H2 chemisorptions, and O2/H2 titrations. The n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out at 500°C, atmospheric pressure, and a H2/C4H10 ratio of 10.</p>
<p>An increase in the Pd dispersion with increasing Ga content was observed for the fresh catalysts, according to CO chemisorption results. H2 chemisorption and H2/O2 titrations were not reliable methods to determine the Pd dispersion in the fresh catalysts. For the calcined catalysts with low Ga contents, the CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd values were very similar, but different for those with the higher Ga contents. These differences were explained based on the presence of chlorine.</p>
<p>Coke deposition produced the deactivation of the catalysts and inhibited hydrogenolysis reactions on Pd, favoring the dehydrogenation selectivity. In the fresh catalysts, the Ga addition caused an effect similar to that produced by coke, reducing the activity and increasing the dehydrogenation selectivity. In the calcined catalysts, the effect of Ga addition on activity was diminished by the calcination treatment. The combination of calcination and high Ga content led to a catalyst with enhanced activity and very high dehydrogenation selectivity.</p>

The study focused on enhancing the selectivity of n-butane dehydrogenation towards propylene using PdGa/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts were characterized through various techniques and tested in a reaction at 500°C with a H2/C4H10 ratio of 10. The addition of Ga increased Pd dispersion, affecting the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Coke deposition inhibited hydrogenolysis reactions, enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. In fresh catalysts, Ga addition reduced activity and increased dehydrogenation selectivity similarly to coke deposition. Calcination treatment partially suppressed the effect of Ga addition on activity. A catalyst with high Ga content and calcination showed enhanced activity and very high dehydrogenation selectivity.

研究专注于通过PdGa/Al2O3催化剂提高n-丁烷脱氢向丙烯的选择性。通过各种技术对催化剂进行了表征，并在500°C下进行了反应，H2/C4H10比为10。添加Ga增加了Pd的分散度，影响了催化剂的活性和选择性。焦炭沉积抑制了氢解反应，增强了脱氢选择性。在新鲜催化剂中，Ga的添加在降低活性并增加脱氢选择性方面与焦炭沉积产生了相似效果。煅烧处理部分抑制了Ga添加对活性的影响。具有高Ga含量和煅烧的催化剂显示出增强的活性和非常高的脱氢选择性。
