<p>The importance of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins has been growing due to the demand for these unsaturated hydrocarbons. Light olefins, such as butenes, are essential raw materials used to obtain polymers, gasoline additives and other chemical products.</p>
<p>Catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins is a selective method to produce alkenes. However, the conversion of paraffins to the corresponding olefins is limited by thermo-dynamics restrictions due to the strong endothermic character of the reaction. High temperatures (530730 8C) are required to reach conversions of nearly 50% for paraffins C2C6.</p>
<p>Alumina-supported Pt catalysts have been used in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, being very active but little selective and strongly deactivated by the formation of coke. For this reason, the catalytic stability and selectivity of this system can be improved with the incorporation of a second metal, such as Sn.</p>
<p>In literature, it has been reported an enhancement in the selectivity towards propylene when Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to study the effects of the addition of Ga and calcination treatment on the catalytic behavior of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>TPR
CO chemisorption O2/H2 titration</p>
<p>Dehydrogenation of n-butane over alumina-supported Pd and PdGa catalysts was studied. Catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a Pd content of 0.66 wt% and atomic Ga/Pd ratios from 0 to 1, using aqueous solutions of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3.</p>
<p>The monometallic Pd catalyst (Pd(F)) shows a reduction peak at 153 8C, which is ascribed to the reduction of PdCl2. This assignment differs from that proposed by Chandra et al. [7], who detected HCl at ca. 150 8C during the TPR run of a fresh Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. They considered that the reduction of PdCl2 on alumina occurred at room temperature and the formed HCl appeared to be adsorbed on alumina surface at lower temperatures and then desorbed at 150 8C. In the present work, no H2 consumption was observed at temperatures below 150 8C for the mentioned catalyst and, therefore, the formation and desorption of HCl occurred simultaneously at 153 8C as a result of PdCl2 reduction at this temperature.</p>
<p>The monometallic Ga catalyst shows a reduction peak at 393 8C (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>The calcined monometallic Pd catalyst showed a reduction peak at 18 8C, which has been attributed to the reduction of crystalline PdO to Pd0 [5], and a peak at 110 8C, which can be ascribed to the reduction of smaller PdO particles interacting with the support.</p>
<p>The TPR profiles of calcined catalysts are showed in Fig. 2. The calcination treatment produced the segregation of the palladium and gallium oxides since several peaks with different temperatures were observed.</p>
<p>Table 2 presents the values of CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd molar ratios, along with the values of HT/OT and HC/HT molar ratios.</p>
<p>The effect of Cl can also be appreciable in the low values of HT/OT ratio (1.21.9) and high values of HC/HT ratio (1), compared with the theoretical values (2.0 and 0.33, respectively), after assuming adsorption stoichiometries of H:Pd and O:Pd of 1:1 [13].</p>
<p>The TOF values were estimated based on the CO chemisorption results, assuming CO:Pd adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1.</p>
<p>The initial dehydrogenation selectivity was higher for the fresh Pd(F) catalyst (48%) than for its calcined Pd(C) equivalent (32%).</p>

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the increasing demand for unsaturated hydrocarbons, particularly light olefins like butenes. These olefins are crucial for the production of polymers, gasoline additives, and other chemical products. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving the catalytic stability and selectivity of the system through the incorporation of secondary metals, such as tin (Sn).

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play significant roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the choice of carrier type can affect the dispersion of the vanadium species, impacting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The surface area of the support influences the availability of active sites, while metal loading determines the concentration of the active component, which can impact the catalyst's performance.

3. The addition of gallium (Ga) to palladium (Pd) catalysts has been reported to enhance the selectivity towards propylene. This improvement can be attributed to electronic effects of Ga on Pd, modifying the catalytic properties and potentially altering the reactivity patterns towards different hydrocarbons.

4. The dehydrogenation of n-butane over alumina-supported Pd and PdGa catalysts was studied, with catalysts prepared through incipient wetness impregnation. The Pd content was set at 0.66 wt%, and various Ga/Pd ratios were used.

5. The monometallic Pd catalyst exhibits a reduction peak at 153°C, indicative of the reduction of PdCl2, whereas the monometallic Ga catalyst shows a peak at 393°C. This suggests a simultaneous reduction process for both metals in the bimetallic PdGa catalysts.

6. The calcination treatment leads to the segregation of palladium and gallium oxides in the catalysts, resulting in multiple reduction peaks at different temperatures.

7. The CO/Pd, H/Pd, and O/Pd ratios, along with the HT/OT and HC/HT ratios, provide insights into the dispersion and interaction of the catalyst components. These parameters are crucial for understanding the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

8. Chloride ions (Cl) present on the surface of the fresh catalysts can cause an overestimation of the amounts of oxygen that reacted with hydrogen, leading to incorrect calculations of the amount of adsorbed oxygen on the Pd surface. This effect impacts the determination of the H/Pd and O/Pd ratios.

9. The turnover frequency (TOF) values, estimated based on CO chemisorption results, indicate the activity of the catalysts over time. The addition of Ga reduces the initial activity and deactivation rates of the catalysts, likely due to electronic effects of Ga on Pd.

10. The initial dehydrogenation selectivity of the fresh Pd(F) catalyst is higher than that of its calcined Pd(C) equivalent, suggesting that the calcination process may negatively impact the catalyst's performance by partially suppressing the effect of Ga addition on activity and selectivity.
