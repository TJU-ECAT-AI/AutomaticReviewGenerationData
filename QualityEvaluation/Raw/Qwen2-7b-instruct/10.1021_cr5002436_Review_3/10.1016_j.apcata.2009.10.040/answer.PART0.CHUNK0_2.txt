[8] "In the present work, no H2 consumption was observed at temperatures below 150 8C for the mentioned catalyst and,therefore, the formation and desorption of HCl occurred simulta- neously at 153 8C as a result of PdCl2 reduction at this temperature."

[14] "The addition of Ga enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity, inhibiting hydrogenolysis reactions on Pd. Coke had a similar effect."
[15] "The catalyst with the higher Ga content subjected to calcination presented an enhanced catalytic performance."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the demand for efficient and selective catalysts capable of producing light olefins, such as butenes, which are crucial for the synthesis of polymers, gasoline additives, and other chemical products. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalyst selectivity and stability through the introduction of various metal additives, including tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), and the optimization of carrier types and support surface areas.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play critical roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Carrier type refers to the material that supports the active metal, affecting the distribution of the metal and its interaction with the substrate. Support surface area impacts the availability of active sites for reactions, while metal loading determines the concentration of the active component, which can influence both the catalytic activity and selectivity. These factors collectively affect the structure and reactivity of vanadium species, impacting the overall efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 对于正构烷烃脱氢为烯烃，使用铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂的需求推动了对钒氧化物基催化剂的研究。作为替代方案，这些催化剂能够高效且选择性地生产如丁烯这样的轻质烯烃，它们对于聚合物、汽油添加剂和其他化学产品的合成至关重要。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点关注通过引入各种金属添加剂（如锡（Sn）、镓（Ga））以及优化载体类型和支持面积来提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。

2. 载体类型、支持面积和金属负载量是影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质的关键因素。载体类型指的是支撑活性金属的材料，它影响金属的分布及其与底物的相互作用。支持面积影响活性位点的可用性，而金属负载量决定了活性成分的浓度，这可以影响催化活性和选择性。这些因素共同影响钒物种的结构和反应性，进而影响催化剂的整体效率和选择性，在正构烷烃脱氢反应中。
