The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. Research has focused on developing catalysts that can efficiently convert paraffins into olefins while minimizing the formation of coke. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, alumina-supported Pt catalysts have been widely used for dehydrogenating light paraffins, but they suffer from poor selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. To address these issues, researchers have looked into adding a second metal, like tin (Sn), to the catalyst system, which improves its properties. Moreover, the addition of gallium (Ga) to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts has been reported to enhance the selectivity towards propylene. The main objective of the study discussed here is to investigate the effects of gallium addition and calcination treatment on the catalytic behavior of palladium (Pd)/alumina catalysts in the dehydrogenation of n-butane.

自1980年代以来，对以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品在烷烃脱氢中的探索已有所发展。研究集中在开发能够高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃并最大限度减少焦炭形成的催化剂。这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到多种因素的影响，如载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载。例如，铝酸盐支持的Pt催化剂广泛用于轻烷烃的脱氢，但它们存在选择性差和快速失活的问题，原因是焦炭的形成。为了克服这些问题，研究人员开始考虑向催化剂系统中添加第二种金属，如锡（Sn），这可以改善其性能。此外，向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓（Ga）已被报道可以提高丙烯的选择性。本研究的主要目标是研究镓添加和煅烧处理对钯（Pd）/氧化铝催化剂在n-丁烷脱氢反应中催化行为的影响。
