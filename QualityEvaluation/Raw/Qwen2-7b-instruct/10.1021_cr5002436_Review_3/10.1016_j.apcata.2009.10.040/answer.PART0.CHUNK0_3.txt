The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the increasing demand for unsaturated hydrocarbons, particularly light olefins such as butenes, which are crucial for polymer production, gasoline additives, and other chemical products. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the development of more efficient and selective catalysts that can overcome the thermodynamic limitations imposed by the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. High temperatures (around 530-730°C) are typically required to achieve substantial conversion rates of paraffins to olefins. Platinum-based catalysts, though highly active, often suffer from deactivation due to the formation of coke. Palladium (Pd)-based catalysts offer a cost-effective alternative to platinum, with studies on their use in dehydrogenating propane showing comparable issues to those encountered with Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, although the addition of a second metal like tin (Sn) can enhance their catalytic properties. Adding gallium (Ga) to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts has been reported to improve the selectivity towards propylene. The current study aims to investigate the impact of Ga addition and calcination treatment on the catalytic performance of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts specifically for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.

对于烷烃脱氢为不饱和烃的需求日益增长，尤其是作为聚合物生产、汽油添加剂和其他化学品原料的关键轻烯烃（如丁烯），这推动了对铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）以外的钒氧化物基催化剂的研究。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展，专注于开发更高效、选择性更强的催化剂，以克服脱氢反应热力学限制所带来的挑战。通常需要约530-730°C的高温才能实现帕拉芬向烯烃的显著转化率。虽然铂基催化剂活性很高，但它们常常因焦炭的形成而失活。钯（Pd）基催化剂提供了成本效益更高的替代方案，针对丙烷的脱氢研究表明，它们遇到了与Pt/Al2O3催化剂类似的问题，尽管添加第二金属如锡（Sn）可以增强这些系统的催化性能。向铂/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓（Ga）已被报道可提高丙烯的选择性。当前的研究旨在研究镓添加和煅烧处理对Pd/Al2O3催化剂用于n-丁烷脱氢催化行为的影响。
