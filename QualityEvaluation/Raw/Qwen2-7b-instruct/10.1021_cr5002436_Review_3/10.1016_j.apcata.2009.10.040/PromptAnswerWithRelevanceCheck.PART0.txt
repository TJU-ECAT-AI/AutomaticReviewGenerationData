The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. Research has focused on developing catalysts that can efficiently convert paraffins into olefins while minimizing the formation of coke. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, alumina-supported Pt catalysts have been widely used for dehydrogenating light paraffins, but they suffer from poor selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. To address these issues, researchers have looked into adding a second metal, like tin (Sn), to the catalyst system, which improves its properties. Moreover, the addition of gallium (Ga) to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts has been reported to enhance the selectivity towards propylene. The main objective of the study discussed here is to investigate the effects of gallium addition and calcination treatment on the catalytic behavior of palladium (Pd)/alumina catalysts in the dehydrogenation of n-butane.

自1980年代以来，对以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品在烷烃脱氢中的探索已有所发展。研究集中在开发能够高效地将烷烃转化为烯烃并最大限度减少焦炭形成的催化剂。这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到多种因素的影响，如载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载。例如，铝酸盐支持的Pt催化剂广泛用于轻烷烃的脱氢，但它们存在选择性差和快速失活的问题，原因是焦炭的形成。为了克服这些问题，研究人员开始考虑向催化剂系统中添加第二种金属，如锡（Sn），这可以改善其性能。此外，向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓（Ga）已被报道可以提高丙烯的选择性。本研究的主要目标是研究镓添加和煅烧处理对钯（Pd）/氧化铝催化剂在n-丁烷脱氢反应中催化行为的影响。

<p>The importance of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins has been growing due to the demand for these unsaturated hydrocarbons. Light olefins, such as butenes, are essential raw materials used to obtain polymers, gasoline additives and other chemical products.</p>
<p>Catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins is a selective method to produce alkenes. However, the conversion of paraffins to the corresponding olefins is limited by thermo-dynamics restrictions due to the strong endothermic character of the reaction. High temperatures (530730 8C) are required to reach conversions of nearly 50% for paraffins C2C6.</p>
<p>Alumina-supported Pt catalysts have been used in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, being very active but little selective and strongly deactivated by the formation of coke. For this reason, the catalytic stability and selectivity of this system can be improved with the incorporation of a second metal, such as Sn.</p>
<p>In literature, it has been reported an enhancement in the selectivity towards propylene when Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to study the effects of the addition of Ga and calcination treatment on the catalytic behavior of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>TPR

<p>Dehydrogenation of n-butane over alumina-supported Pd and PdGa catalysts was studied. Catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a Pd content of 0.66 wt% and atomic Ga/Pd ratios from 0 to 1, using aqueous solutions of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3.</p>
<p>The monometallic Pd catalyst (Pd(F)) shows a reduction peak at 153 8C, which is ascribed to the reduction of PdCl2. This assignment differs from that proposed by Chandra et al. [7], who detected HCl at ca. 150 8C during the TPR run of a fresh Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. They considered that the reduction of PdCl2 on alumina occurred at room temperature and the formed HCl appeared to be adsorbed on alumina surface at lower temperatures and then desorbed at 150 8C. In the present work, no H2 consumption was observed at temperatures below 150 8C for the mentioned catalyst and, therefore, the formation and desorption of HCl occurred simultaneously at 153 8C as a result of PdCl2 reduction at this temperature.</p>
<p>The monometallic Ga catalyst shows a reduction peak at 393 8C (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>The calcined monometallic Pd catalyst showed a reduction peak at 18 8C, which has been attributed to the reduction of crystalline PdO to Pd0 [5], and a peak at 110 8C, which can be ascribed to the reduction of smaller PdO particles interacting with the support.</p>
<p>The TPR profiles of calcined catalysts are showed in Fig. 2. The calcination treatment produced the segregation of the palladium and gallium oxides since several peaks with different temperatures were observed.</p>

<p>The TOF values were estimated based on the CO chemisorption results, assuming CO:Pd adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1.</p>

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the increasing demand for unsaturated hydrocarbons, particularly light olefins like butenes. These olefins are crucial for the production of polymers, gasoline additives, and other chemical products. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving the catalytic stability and selectivity of the system through the incorporation of secondary metals, such as tin (Sn).

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play significant roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the choice of carrier type can affect the dispersion of the vanadium species, impacting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The surface area of the support influences the availability of active sites, while metal loading determines the concentration of the active component, which can impact the catalyst's performance.

3. The addition of gallium (Ga) to palladium (Pd) catalysts has been reported to enhance the selectivity towards propylene. This improvement can be attributed to electronic effects of Ga on Pd, modifying the catalytic properties and potentially altering the reactivity patterns towards different hydrocarbons.

4. The dehydrogenation of n-butane over alumina-supported Pd and PdGa catalysts was studied, with catalysts prepared through incipient wetness impregnation. The Pd content was set at 0.66 wt%, and various Ga/Pd ratios were used.

5. The monometallic Pd catalyst exhibits a reduction peak at 153°C, indicative of the reduction of PdCl2, whereas the monometallic Ga catalyst shows a peak at 393°C. This suggests a simultaneous reduction process for both metals in the bimetallic PdGa catalysts.

6. The calcination treatment leads to the segregation of palladium and gallium oxides in the catalysts, resulting in multiple reduction peaks at different temperatures.

7. The CO/Pd, H/Pd, and O/Pd ratios, along with the HT/OT and HC/HT ratios, provide insights into the dispersion and interaction of the catalyst components. These parameters are crucial for understanding the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

8. Chloride ions (Cl) present on the surface of the fresh catalysts can cause an overestimation of the amounts of oxygen that reacted with hydrogen, leading to incorrect calculations of the amount of adsorbed oxygen on the Pd surface. This effect impacts the determination of the H/Pd and O/Pd ratios.

9. The turnover frequency (TOF) values, estimated based on CO chemisorption results, indicate the activity of the catalysts over time. The addition of Ga reduces the initial activity and deactivation rates of the catalysts, likely due to electronic effects of Ga on Pd.

10. The initial dehydrogenation selectivity of the fresh Pd(F) catalyst is higher than that of its calcined Pd(C) equivalent, suggesting that the calcination process may negatively impact the catalyst's performance by partially suppressing the effect of Ga addition on activity and selectivity.

1. 对于烷烃脱氢以生产烯烃的需求增长，推动了范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品的研究。这些烯烃是生产聚合物、汽油添加剂和其他化学产品的关键原料。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究不断发展，着重于通过引入副金属（如锡）来改善催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

2. 载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为有着显著影响。例如，载体类型的选取可以影响钯物种的分散度，进而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。支撑表面积决定了活性位点的可用性，而金属负载则确定了活性成分的浓度，这可能会影响催化剂的性能。

3. 向钯催化剂中添加镓（Ga）已被报道可增强丙烯的选择性。这种改进可能归因于Ga对Pd的电子效应，修改了催化特性和可能改变了对不同烃类反应性的模式。

4. 在这项研究中，考察了铝氧支持的Pd和PdGa催化剂对n-丁烷的脱氢作用，催化剂通过浸渍法制备，Pd含量为0.66 wt%，并使用了不同的Ga/Pd比率。

5. 单一Pd催化剂在153°C处显示出PdCl2还原的峰，而单一Ga催化剂在393°C处显示出峰，这表明在双金属PdGa催化剂中存在同时还原过程。

6. 焙烧处理导致钯和镓氧化物在催化剂中的分离，产生多个不同温度的还原峰。

7. CO/Pd、H/Pd、O/Pd比率以及HT/OT和HC/HT比率提供了有关催化剂组分分布和相互作用的见解。这些参数对于理解催化剂的活性和选择性至关重要。

8. 表面存在的氯离子（Cl）可能会导致氢与反应生成的氯化氢之间的错误计算，从而导致Pd表面吸附氧量的低估。这影响了H/Pd和O/Pd比率的测定。

9. 基于CO吸着的结果估计的周转频率（TOF）值显示了催化剂随时间的变化。Ga的添加降低了催化剂的初始活性和失活率，可能由于Ga对Pd的电子效应。

10. 鲜催化剂中Pd(F)的初始脱氢选择性高于其焙烧后的Pd(C)等效物，这表明焙烧过程可能部分抑制了Ga添加对活性和选择性的影响。

Platinum-based catalysts, though highly active, often suffer from deactivation due to the formation of coke. Palladium (Pd)-based catalysts offer a cost-effective alternative to platinum, with studies on their use in dehydrogenating propane showing comparable issues to those encountered with Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, although the addition of a second metal like tin (Sn) can enhance their catalytic properties. Adding gallium (Ga) to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts has been reported to improve the selectivity towards propylene. The current study aims to investigate the impact of Ga addition and calcination treatment on the catalytic performance of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts specifically for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.

<p>The dehydrogenation of n-butane over PdGa/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied to enhance the selectivity towards propylene. The catalysts were prepared by impregnation with aqueous solutions of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3, and characterized by various methods including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, N2 adsorption, temperature programmed reduction, CO and H2 chemisorptions, and O2/H2 titrations. The n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out at 500°C, atmospheric pressure, and a H2/C4H10 ratio of 10.</p>
<p>An increase in the Pd dispersion with increasing Ga content was observed for the fresh catalysts, according to CO chemisorption results. H2 chemisorption and H2/O2 titrations were not reliable methods to determine the Pd dispersion in the fresh catalysts. For the calcined catalysts with low Ga contents, the CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd values were very similar, but different for those with the higher Ga contents. These differences were explained based on the presence of chlorine.</p>
<p>Coke deposition produced the deactivation of the catalysts and inhibited hydrogenolysis reactions on Pd, favoring the dehydrogenation selectivity. In the fresh catalysts, the Ga addition caused an effect similar to that produced by coke, reducing the activity and increasing the dehydrogenation selectivity.

The study focused on enhancing the selectivity of n-butane dehydrogenation towards propylene using PdGa/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts were characterized through various techniques and tested in a reaction at 500°C with a H2/C4H10 ratio of 10. The addition of Ga increased Pd dispersion, affecting the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Coke deposition inhibited hydrogenolysis reactions, enhancing dehydrogenation selectivity. In fresh catalysts, Ga addition reduced activity and increased dehydrogenation selectivity similarly to coke deposition. Calcination treatment partially suppressed the effect of Ga addition on activity. A catalyst with high Ga content and calcination showed enhanced activity and very high dehydrogenation selectivity.
