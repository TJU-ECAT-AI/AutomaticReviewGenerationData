[1] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated. First, the catalytic performance of a silica- supported vanadium oxide catalyst for the dehydroge- nation of propane at 823 K was examined in the pres- ence/absence of CO2."
[2] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated. Then, the reduction of the vanadium oxide catalyst in a stream of H2 was investi- gated."
[3] "NH3 desorption studies on the acid sites on the catalyst and in-situ UVvis studies on the vanadium species on the catalyst were also performed."
[4] "The findings in the present study suggest that the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst could be reduced to V4+/V3+ in the dehy- drogenation of propane in the absence of CO2 to lead to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide."
[5] "In the case of the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, the pre-treatment of the catalyst with H2 hardly altered the yields of aromatics and propene and the selectivities to aromatics and to propene in the dehydrogenation."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the need for environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research has evolved to focus on optimizing catalyst components such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to improve performance. Variables such as these can significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts, affecting their efficiency in paraffin dehydrogenation processes.
2. The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated under both the presence and absence of CO2. The catalytic performance of the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 823 K was examined. Additionally, the reduction of the vanadium oxide catalyst in a hydrogen stream was studied. Studies on acid sites on the catalyst and in-situ UV-visible studies on vanadium species were also conducted.
3. The research included NH3 desorption studies to assess the acid sites on the catalyst and in-situ UV-visible spectroscopic studies to analyze the vanadium species on the catalyst.
4. The findings indicated that the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst could be reduced to vanadium(IV)/vanadium(III) ions (V4+/V3+) during the absence of CO2 in the dehydrogenation process. This reduction leads to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide, which can enhance the production of aromatics and increase the amount of carbonaceous deposits.
5. In the presence of CO2 during the dehydrogenation process, the pre-treatment of the catalyst with hydrogen had minimal impact on the yields of aromatics and propene and the selectivities to aromatics and propene. This suggests that CO2 may alter the behavior of the vanadium oxide in the catalyst, potentially influencing the catalytic properties and the reaction outcomes.

1. 针对铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)催化剂在烷烃脱氢过程中对环境的影响，人们开始探索使用二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂作为替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，研究工作已经发展到优化催化剂成分，如载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载，以提高性能。这些变量可以显著影响催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，从而影响烷烃脱氢过程的效率。
2. 在本研究中，考察了在二氧化碳存在或不存在的情况下，二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂对丙烷脱氢的催化性能。对823 K下的丙烷脱氢进行了催化剂性能研究，并且在氢气流中对钒氧化物催化剂进行了还原。还进行了氨脱附研究，以评估催化剂上的酸性位点，并进行了原位紫外可见光谱研究，以分析催化剂上的钒物种。
3. 研究包括氨脱附研究，用于评估催化剂上的酸性位点，以及原位紫外可见光谱研究，用于分析催化剂上的钒物种。
4. 研究结果表明，在没有二氧化碳的情况下进行脱氢反应时，二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂中的钒可以被还原为四价/三价钒(V4+/V3+)。这种还原导致在钒氧化物表面形成酸性位点，这可以增强芳香族化合物的产量并增加碳沉积物的数量。
5. 在存在二氧化碳的情况下进行脱氢反应时，催化剂预处理氢气对芳香族化合物和丙烯的产率以及芳香族化合物和丙烯的选择性几乎没有影响。这表明二氧化碳可能改变催化剂中钒氧化物的行为，可能影响催化性能和反应结果。
