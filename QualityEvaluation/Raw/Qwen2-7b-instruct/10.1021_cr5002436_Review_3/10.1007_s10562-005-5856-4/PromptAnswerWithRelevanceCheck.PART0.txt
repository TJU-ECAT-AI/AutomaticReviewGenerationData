1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the need for environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research has evolved to focus on optimizing catalyst components such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to improve performance. Variables such as these can significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts, affecting their efficiency in paraffin dehydrogenation processes.
2. The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated under both the presence and absence of CO2. The catalytic performance of the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 823 K was examined. Additionally, the reduction of the vanadium oxide catalyst in a hydrogen stream was studied. Studies on acid sites on the catalyst and in-situ UV-visible studies on vanadium species were also conducted.
3. The research included NH3 desorption studies to assess the acid sites on the catalyst and in-situ UV-visible spectroscopic studies to analyze the vanadium species on the catalyst.
4. The findings indicated that the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst could be reduced to vanadium(IV)/vanadium(III) ions (V4+/V3+) during the absence of CO2 in the dehydrogenation process. This reduction leads to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide, which can enhance the production of aromatics and increase the amount of carbonaceous deposits.
5. In the presence of CO2 during the dehydrogenation process, the pre-treatment of the catalyst with hydrogen had minimal impact on the yields of aromatics and propene and the selectivities to aromatics and propene. This suggests that CO2 may alter the behavior of the vanadium oxide in the catalyst, potentially influencing the catalytic properties and the reaction outcomes.

1. 针对铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)催化剂在烷烃脱氢过程中对环境的影响，人们开始探索使用二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂作为替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，研究工作已经发展到优化催化剂成分，如载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载，以提高性能。这些变量可以显著影响催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，从而影响烷烃脱氢过程的效率。
2. 在本研究中，考察了在二氧化碳存在或不存在的情况下，二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂对丙烷脱氢的催化性能。对823 K下的丙烷脱氢进行了催化剂性能研究，并且在氢气流中对钒氧化物催化剂进行了还原。还进行了氨脱附研究，以评估催化剂上的酸性位点，并进行了原位紫外可见光谱研究，以分析催化剂上的钒物种。
3. 研究包括氨脱附研究，用于评估催化剂上的酸性位点，以及原位紫外可见光谱研究，用于分析催化剂上的钒物种。
4. 研究结果表明，在没有二氧化碳的情况下进行脱氢反应时，二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂中的钒可以被还原为四价/三价钒(V4+/V3+)。这种还原导致在钒氧化物表面形成酸性位点，这可以增强芳香族化合物的产量并增加碳沉积物的数量。
5. 在存在二氧化碳的情况下进行脱氢反应时，催化剂预处理氢气对芳香族化合物和丙烯的产率以及芳香族化合物和丙烯的选择性几乎没有影响。这表明二氧化碳可能改变催化剂中钒氧化物的行为，可能影响催化性能和反应结果。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on developing catalysts without chromium. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have been found to influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the presence of CO2 affects the yield and selectivity of propene versus aromatics in the dehydrogenation process. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst can be reduced to V4+/V3+ at certain temperatures, leading to the formation of acid sites that enhance the yield of aromatics but also increase carbon deposition. Conversely, the oxidizing action of CO2 can prevent the formation of acid sites, resulting in a higher yield of propene and less carbon deposition.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为丙烷脱氢替代铂和CrOx催化剂的探索，主要是出于环保考虑。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，重点是开发不含铬的高性能催化剂。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量被发现会影响这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为。例如，在脱氢过程中，二氧化碳的存在影响了丙烯与芳香烃的产率和选择性。催化剂中的范德华氧化物可以在一定温度下被还原为V4+/V3+，导致酸性位点的形成，从而提高芳香烃的产率，但同时也会增加碳沉积。相反，二氧化碳的氧化作用可以阻止酸性位点的形成，导致更高的丙烯产率和更少的碳沉积。

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been motivated by the environmental concerns associated with the use of Pt and CrOx catalysts. This interest dates back to the 1980s, when researchers started exploring alternatives due to the potential toxicity and scarcity of chromium. The development of catalysts based on gallium oxide was one of these efforts. Since then, the focus has shifted towards understanding the behavior and properties of vanadium species within these catalysts. Factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature of vanadium species. For instance, the presence of CO2 affects the yield of propene and aromatics, with CO2 leading to higher propene yield and lower aromatics yield compared to its absence. The reduction of vanadium oxide at specific temperatures enables the formation of acid sites, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation process. However, CO2 can inhibit this process by reducing the number of these acid sites, thus affecting the yield of propene and the amount of carbonaceous deposits.

The findings suggest that in the absence of CO2, the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst could be reduced to V4+/V3+, leading to the formation of acid sites and producing higher yields of aromatics. In contrast, in the presence of CO2, the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide could be V5+, which does not lead to the formation of acid sites but results in a higher yield of propene and fewer carbonaceous deposits. The pre-treatment of the catalyst with H2 increases the number of acid sites, while CO2 reduces them. The surface area of the support also influences the behavior of vanadium species, impacting the catalytic performance of the catalyst.

环保角度下，研究人员关注了镓氧化物基催化剂，作为不含铬的高性能脱氢化丙烷催化剂的发展。这一研究兴趣可追溯到1980年代，当时由于铬的潜在毒性与稀缺性，研究人员开始探索替代Pt和CrOx催化剂的可能性。此后，研究重点转向理解这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和特性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等因素显著影响了钒物种的性质。例如，在二氧化碳的存在与否下，丙烷脱氢过程会影响丙烯和芳香烃的产率，二氧化碳导致丙烯产率更高而芳香烃产率较低。通过特定温度下的还原可以形成酸性位点，这对脱氢过程至关重要。然而，二氧化碳可以抑制这一过程，通过减少酸性位点的数量，从而影响丙烯产率和碳沉积物的数量。

发现表明，在二氧化碳不存在的情况下，硅基二氧化钛催化剂中的钒可以还原为V4+/V3+，导致酸性位点的形成并产生更高的芳香烃产率。相比之下，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，催化剂表面的钒可能为V5+，这不会导致酸性位点的形成但能产生更高的丙烯产率和更少的碳沉积物。催化剂预处理使用氢气增加酸性位点的数量，而二氧化碳则减少了它们的数量。支持表面的表面积也影响了钒物种的行为，进而影响催化剂的催化性能。

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to develop environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalyst performance while reducing the use of toxic metals. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. In the context of the study, the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst showed enhanced performance in the dehydrogenation of propane when CO2 was present. Specifically, the yield of propene and its selectivity were higher in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and their selectivity were much higher in the absence of CO2.

3. The reduction of vanadium oxide in the catalyst occurred within the temperature range of 723 to 873 K. Part of the reduced vanadium oxide could be re-oxidized by CO2 at 823 K. This suggests a dynamic behavior of vanadium species in the presence of CO2.

4. The study indicates that the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst can be reduced to V4+/V3+ in the absence of CO2, leading to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide. These acid sites contribute to higher yields of aromatics and increased carbonaceous deposits.

5. In contrast, the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the presence of CO2 is proposed to be in the V5+ form, which does not facilitate acid site formation. This condition results in a higher yield of propene and a lesser amount of carbonaceous deposits.

3. 钒氧化物在催化剂中的还原温度范围为723至873 K。部分还原的钒氧化物可以在823 K时被CO2重新氧化。这表明在CO2存在下，钒物种具有动态行为。

4. 研究表明，当没有CO2时，二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂中的钒可以还原为V4+/V3+，导致表面钒氧化物上酸性位点的形成。这些酸性位点促进了芳香烃的更高产率和增加的碳沉积物。

5. 相比之下，当存在CO2时，钒氧化物表面的钒被认为是以V5+的形式存在，这不促进酸性位点的形成。这种情况导致更高的丙烯产率和较少的碳沉积物。
