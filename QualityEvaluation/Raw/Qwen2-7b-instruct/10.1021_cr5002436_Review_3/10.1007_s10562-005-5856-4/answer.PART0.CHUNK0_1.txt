[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The authors recently reported that a silica-supported gallium oxide catalyst was moderately active and highly selective to propene in the dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures ranging from 793 K to 853 K."
[3] "First, the catalytic performance of a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane at 823 K was examined in the presence/absence of CO2."
[4] "The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[5] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[6] "The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K."
[7] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[8] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."
[9] "It is also suggested that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 could be V5+ which could not lead to the formation of acid sites but result in a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on developing catalysts without chromium. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have been found to influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the presence of CO2 affects the yield and selectivity of propene versus aromatics in the dehydrogenation process. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst can be reduced to V4+/V3+ at certain temperatures, leading to the formation of acid sites that enhance the yield of aromatics but also increase carbon deposition. Conversely, the oxidizing action of CO2 can prevent the formation of acid sites, resulting in a higher yield of propene and less carbon deposition.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为丙烷脱氢替代铂和CrOx催化剂的探索，主要是出于环保考虑。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，重点是开发不含铬的高性能催化剂。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量被发现会影响这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为。例如，在脱氢过程中，二氧化碳的存在影响了丙烯与芳香烃的产率和选择性。催化剂中的范德华氧化物可以在一定温度下被还原为V4+/V3+，导致酸性位点的形成，从而提高芳香烃的产率，但同时也会增加碳沉积。相反，二氧化碳的氧化作用可以阻止酸性位点的形成，导致更高的丙烯产率和更少的碳沉积。
