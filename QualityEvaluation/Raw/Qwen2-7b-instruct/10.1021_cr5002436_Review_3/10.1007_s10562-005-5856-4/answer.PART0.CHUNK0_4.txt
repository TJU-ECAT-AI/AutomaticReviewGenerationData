[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The authors recently reported that a silica-supported gallium oxide catalyst was moderately active and highly selective to propene in the dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures ranging from 793 K to 853 K."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated at 823 K in the presence/absence of CO2."
[4] "The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[5] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[6] "The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K."
[7] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[8] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."
[9] "The findings in the present study suggest that the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst could be reduced to V4+/V3+ in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of CO2 to lead to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide."
[10] "It is also suggested that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 could be V5+ which could not lead to the formation of acid sites but result in a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by environmental considerations, aiming to develop high-performance catalysts free of chromium.
2. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on catalysts based on gallium oxide, which were reported to be moderately active and highly selective for propene in propane dehydrogenation.
3. The silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated for its performance in propane dehydrogenation, particularly in the presence or absence of CO2.
4. In the presence of CO2, the yield of propene and its selectivity were higher compared to the absence of CO2.
5. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and their selectivity were significantly higher in the absence of CO2.
6. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced within a specific temperature range, and a portion of the reduced vanadium oxide could be re-oxidized by CO2 at 823 K.
7. Pre-treating the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 increased the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 had the opposite effect.
8. UVvis studies revealed that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide could exist as V4+/V3+ in H2 and the absence of CO2, transitioning to V5+ due to CO2's oxidizing action during dehydrogenation.
9. The study suggested that reducing vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst to V4+/V3+ in the absence of CO2 facilitated the formation of acid sites on the catalyst surface, enhancing aromatics yield and carbon deposition.
10. In contrast, the presence of CO2 led to vanadium existing as V5+, which did not promote acid site formation but resulted in a higher propene yield and less carbon deposition.

1. 从环境角度考虑，研究人员关注镓氧化物基催化剂，以开发不含铬的高性能催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢。
2. 自1980年代以来，该领域的研究发展，重点关注基于镓氧化物的催化剂，据报道在793 K至853 K的温度范围内，其对丙烷脱氢具有适度活性和高选择性。
3. 研究人员调查了二氧化硅支持的五氧化二钒催化剂在823 K下的丙烷脱氢性能，特别是在二氧化碳存在与否的情况下。
4. 在二氧化碳的存在下，丙烯的产率和选择性高于其不存在的情况。
5. 相反，在不存在二氧化碳的情况下，芳烃的产率和选择性要高得多。
6. 催化剂中的五氧化二钒可以在特定的温度范围内被还原，并且催化剂中部分还原的五氧化二钒可以被二氧化碳在823 K时重新氧化。
7. 将五氧化二钒催化剂预处理为氢气可增加催化剂表面的酸性位点数量，而二氧化碳则有相反的效果。
8. UVvis研究表明，催化剂表面的五氧化二钒在氢气和不存在二氧化碳的情况下可以存在为V4+/V3+，在存在二氧化碳时由于二氧化碳的氧化作用转变为V5+。
9. 研究表明，将二氧化硅支持的五氧化二钒催化剂中的五氧化二钒降低到V4+/V3+在不存在二氧化碳的情况下有助于在催化剂表面形成酸性位点，从而提高芳烃的产率和碳沉积。
10. 相比之下，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，五氧化二钒以V5+的形式存在，这不促进酸性位点的形成，但导致更高的丙烯产率和更少的碳沉积。
