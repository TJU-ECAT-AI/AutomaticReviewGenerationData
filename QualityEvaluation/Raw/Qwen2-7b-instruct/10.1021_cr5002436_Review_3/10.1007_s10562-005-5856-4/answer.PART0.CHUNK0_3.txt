1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to develop environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalyst performance while reducing the use of toxic metals. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. In the context of the study, the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst showed enhanced performance in the dehydrogenation of propane when CO2 was present. Specifically, the yield of propene and its selectivity were higher in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and their selectivity were much higher in the absence of CO2.

3. The reduction of vanadium oxide in the catalyst occurred within the temperature range of 723 to 873 K. Part of the reduced vanadium oxide could be re-oxidized by CO2 at 823 K. This suggests a dynamic behavior of vanadium species in the presence of CO2.

4. The study indicates that the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst can be reduced to V4+/V3+ in the absence of CO2, leading to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide. These acid sites contribute to higher yields of aromatics and increased carbonaceous deposits.

5. In contrast, the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the presence of CO2 is proposed to be in the V5+ form, which does not facilitate acid site formation. This condition results in a higher yield of propene and a lesser amount of carbonaceous deposits.

1. 对于丙烷脱氢，使用镓氧化物基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品进行探索，主要是为了开发不含铬的高性能催化剂。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经显著发展，着重于在减少有毒金属使用的同时提高催化剂性能。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对这些催化剂中的钒物种的性质和行为有显著影响。

2. 在这项研究中，含碳氧化铝的二氧化硅载体的钒氧化物催化剂在823K下表现出增强的丙烷脱氢性能。具体而言，在CO2存在时，丙烯的产率和其选择性高于其不存在的情况。相反，在没有CO2的情况下，芳香烃的产率和其选择性要高得多。

3. 钒氧化物在催化剂中的还原温度范围为723至873 K。部分还原的钒氧化物可以在823 K时被CO2重新氧化。这表明在CO2存在下，钒物种具有动态行为。

4. 研究表明，当没有CO2时，二氧化硅支持的钒氧化物催化剂中的钒可以还原为V4+/V3+，导致表面钒氧化物上酸性位点的形成。这些酸性位点促进了芳香烃的更高产率和增加的碳沉积物。

5. 相比之下，当存在CO2时，钒氧化物表面的钒被认为是以V5+的形式存在，这不促进酸性位点的形成。这种情况导致更高的丙烯产率和较少的碳沉积物。
