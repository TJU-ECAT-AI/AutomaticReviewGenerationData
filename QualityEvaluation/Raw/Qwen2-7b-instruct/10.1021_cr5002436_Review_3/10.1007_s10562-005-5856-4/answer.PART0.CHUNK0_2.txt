Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been motivated by the environmental concerns associated with the use of Pt and CrOx catalysts. This interest dates back to the 1980s, when researchers started exploring alternatives due to the potential toxicity and scarcity of chromium. The development of catalysts based on gallium oxide was one of these efforts. Since then, the focus has shifted towards understanding the behavior and properties of vanadium species within these catalysts. Factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature of vanadium species. For instance, the presence of CO2 affects the yield of propene and aromatics, with CO2 leading to higher propene yield and lower aromatics yield compared to its absence. The reduction of vanadium oxide at specific temperatures enables the formation of acid sites, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation process. However, CO2 can inhibit this process by reducing the number of these acid sites, thus affecting the yield of propene and the amount of carbonaceous deposits.

The findings suggest that in the absence of CO2, the vanadium in the silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst could be reduced to V4+/V3+, leading to the formation of acid sites and producing higher yields of aromatics. In contrast, in the presence of CO2, the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide could be V5+, which does not lead to the formation of acid sites but results in a higher yield of propene and fewer carbonaceous deposits. The pre-treatment of the catalyst with H2 increases the number of acid sites, while CO2 reduces them. The surface area of the support also influences the behavior of vanadium species, impacting the catalytic performance of the catalyst.

环保角度下，研究人员关注了镓氧化物基催化剂，作为不含铬的高性能脱氢化丙烷催化剂的发展。这一研究兴趣可追溯到1980年代，当时由于铬的潜在毒性与稀缺性，研究人员开始探索替代Pt和CrOx催化剂的可能性。此后，研究重点转向理解这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和特性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等因素显著影响了钒物种的性质。例如，在二氧化碳的存在与否下，丙烷脱氢过程会影响丙烯和芳香烃的产率，二氧化碳导致丙烯产率更高而芳香烃产率较低。通过特定温度下的还原可以形成酸性位点，这对脱氢过程至关重要。然而，二氧化碳可以抑制这一过程，通过减少酸性位点的数量，从而影响丙烯产率和碳沉积物的数量。

发现表明，在二氧化碳不存在的情况下，硅基二氧化钛催化剂中的钒可以还原为V4+/V3+，导致酸性位点的形成并产生更高的芳香烃产率。相比之下，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，催化剂表面的钒可能为V5+，这不会导致酸性位点的形成但能产生更高的丙烯产率和更少的碳沉积物。催化剂预处理使用氢气增加酸性位点的数量，而二氧化碳则减少了它们的数量。支持表面的表面积也影响了钒物种的行为，进而影响催化剂的催化性能。
