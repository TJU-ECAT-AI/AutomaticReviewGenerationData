[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane,5 dehydrogena- tion of ethylbenzene6 or propane.7 However, the role of CO2 in these reactions is still not clear."
[2] "Here, we study the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over several metal oxide catalysts, and we have found that CO2 markedly promoted dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 catalyst."
[3] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3 catalyst produced mainly C2H4, CO, H2 and H2O."
[4] "With CO2 considerable amounts of CO and H2O were formed during the reaction, indicating reaction of CO2 with H2."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has been influenced by the desire to reduce the cost and environmental impact associated with traditional catalysts. Since the 1980s, researchers have sought to develop more efficient and selective catalysts that could replace or complement the performance of platinum and chromium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation processes. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Carrier type influences the dispersion of vanadium, affecting its reactivity and stability. Support surface area impacts the accessibility of reactants to the active sites, potentially altering reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium species, which can influence the overall catalytic activity and the formation of desired products. These factors collectively contribute to the optimization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for more efficient and environmentally friendly paraffin dehydrogenation.
