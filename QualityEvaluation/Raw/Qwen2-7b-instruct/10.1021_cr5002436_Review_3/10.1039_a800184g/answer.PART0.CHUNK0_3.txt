The research on using carbon dioxide as an oxidant in various chemical reactions, such as methane coupling, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, and propane dehydrogenation, has been ongoing. However, the precise role of carbon dioxide in these processes remains uncertain. The study focused on the dehydrogenation of ethane using gallium oxide as a catalyst in the presence of carbon dioxide. It was found that the use of carbon dioxide significantly enhanced the activity of the gallium oxide catalyst, doubling its efficiency compared to using the catalyst without carbon dioxide. Although the mechanism behind carbon dioxide's promotion effect on ethane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide is not fully understood, the study highlights the potential of carbon dioxide as a promoter in hydrocarbon conversion processes.

在甲烷耦合、乙基苯脱氢和丙烷脱氢等化学反应中使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的研究一直在进行。然而，二氧化碳在这些过程中的确切作用仍然不清楚。研究集中在使用镓氧化物作为催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下进行乙烷脱氢。研究发现，使用二氧化碳显著增强了镓氧化物催化剂的活性，其效率是不使用二氧化碳时的两倍。尽管还不完全清楚二氧化碳在镓氧化物上促进乙烷脱氢的作用机制，但这项研究强调了二氧化碳在烃类转化过程中作为促进剂的潜力。
