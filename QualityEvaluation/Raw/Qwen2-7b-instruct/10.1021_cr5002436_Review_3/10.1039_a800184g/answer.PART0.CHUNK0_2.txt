Answer: 
The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the search for more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on optimizing the catalyst composition, including the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading, to enhance the activity and stability of vanadium species. These variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalyst, affecting its ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions efficiently. For instance, studies have shown that the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) can markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallium oxide (Ga2O3) catalysts, leading to the formation of ethene. The interaction of CO2 with hydrogen (H2) during the reaction indicates that CO2 might react with H2, contributing to the dehydrogenation process. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the dehydrogenation of ethane is catalyzed by acid sites present on the Ga2O3 surface, highlighting the importance of surface chemistry in enhancing catalytic performance.

范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索，主要是为了寻找更高效、成本更低且环境友好的催化剂。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，着重优化催化剂组成，包括载体类型、支撑面积和金属负载等变量，以提升钒物种的活性与稳定性。这些变量影响着钒物种在催化剂内的性质与行为，进而影响其促进脱氢反应的效率。例如，研究表明，在二氧化碳（CO2）的存在下，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）催化剂能显著促进乙烷的脱氢，产生乙烯。CO2与氢（H2）之间的相互作用表明，CO2可能与H2反应，参与脱氢过程。此外，有研究指出，乙烷的脱氢主要由Ga2O3表面的酸性位点催化，强调了表面化学在增强催化性能中的重要性。
