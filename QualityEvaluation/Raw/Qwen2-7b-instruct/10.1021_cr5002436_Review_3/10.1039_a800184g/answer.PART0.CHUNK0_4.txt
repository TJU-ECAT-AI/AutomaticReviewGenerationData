[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane,5 dehydrogena- tion of ethylbenzene6 or propane.7 However, the role of CO2 in these reactions is still not clear."
[2] "Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2 over Ga2O3 catalyst produced mainly C2H4, CO, H2 and H2O."
[3] "CO2 promoted dehydrogenation of ethane exclusively over Ga2O3 catalyst. To our knowledge, such a marked promotion effect of CO2 in a hydrocarbon conversion process has never been previously observed."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by efforts to find more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. These advancements aim to improve the selectivity, activity, and stability of vanadium-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of vanadium oxide particles, impacting their reactivity and stability. The support surface area influences the accessibility of active sites, affecting the catalytic performance. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium species, which can alter the reaction pathways and efficiency. Optimizing these parameters can lead to improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability for paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.
