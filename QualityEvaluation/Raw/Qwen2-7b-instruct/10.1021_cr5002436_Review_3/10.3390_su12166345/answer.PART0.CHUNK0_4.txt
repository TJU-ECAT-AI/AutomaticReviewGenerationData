The current study aimed to explore the connections between teachers' burnout levels, their work engagement, and their confidence in in-service training. The analysis revealed that teachers' work engagement, despite being positively correlated with their confidence in training, also indirectly affects this relationship through the mediating role of burnout. Engaged teachers tend to have higher confidence in their professional training, while those experiencing high burnout exhibit lower confidence in such training opportunities. The study found that burnout acts as a mediator, reducing the positive impact of work engagement on confidence in training.

当前的研究旨在探讨教师的工作倦怠水平、工作投入和对在职培训的信心之间的关系。分析结果显示，尽管教师的工作投入与他们对在职培训的信心呈正相关，但这种关系也通过倦怠的中介作用间接影响。工作投入较高的教师往往对在职培训更有信心，而经历高倦怠的教师则表现出较低的信心。研究发现，倦怠作为中介因素，减少了工作投入对培训信心的正面影响。
