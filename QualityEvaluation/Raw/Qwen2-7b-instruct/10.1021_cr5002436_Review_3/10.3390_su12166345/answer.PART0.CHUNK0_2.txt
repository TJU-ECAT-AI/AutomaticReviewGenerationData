[1] "In the current study, we investigated the relationships between teachers' work engagement, levels of burnout, and attitudes towards training."
[2] "Indeed, recent findings suggest that teachers begin their professional careers with high levels of work engagement and commitment, which give them the energy to cope with stressful events."
[3] "Nevertheless, being engaged at the beginning of their career does not prevent teachers from later experiencing burnout."
[4] "Work burnout is broadly defined as a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, detachment from work, and reduced personal accomplishment."
[5] "Both work engagement and burnout have an impact on teachers' attitudes towards their job: while engaged teachers are motivated to improve their professional competence, burned-out teachers are more likely to reject professional learning opportunities."
[6] "We expected that burnout would mediate the relationship between work engagement and teachers' confidence in training."
[7] "Specifically, we expected that teachers with low work engagement would display high levels of burnout that, in turn, would negatively influence their confidence in training."
[8] "Our findings show a good reliability of the index for both latent factors, i.e., personal and professional growth in training, as well as for the unidimensional measure able to evaluate teachers' perceptions of training."

The study examined the impact of teachers' work engagement, burnout levels, and confidence in training. It was found that engaged teachers are more confident in their professional training, while burned-out teachers have lower confidence in training. The study also showed that teachers' burnout acts as a mediator between work engagement and confidence in training. This means that about 45% of the positive effect of work engagement on confidence in training is weakened by burnout levels. Policies on teacher professional development should consider teachers' attitudes towards in-service training, as these attitudes are influenced by their level of burnout during training.

该研究探讨了教师的工作投入、工作倦怠水平以及对培训的信心之间的关系。发现，投入工作的教师对专业培训更有信心，而倦怠的教师则对培训的信心较低。研究还显示，教师的工作倦怠在工作投入与对培训的信心之间起到了中介作用。这意味着工作投入对信心的约45%的积极影响被倦怠水平削弱。教师专业发展政策应考虑教师对在职培训的态度，因为这些态度受到培训期间的倦怠水平的影响。
