The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer more cost-effective, durable, and environmentally friendly options. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst performance through the modification of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalyst, affecting its activity, stability, and selectivity towards desired products. For instance, at temperatures ranging from 500 to 540°C, adjusting the propane/oxygen ratio impacts the efficiency of dehydrogenation, demonstrating how catalyst design parameters can be fine-tuned to achieve optimal conversion and selectivity.

探索以二氧化钒为基础的催化剂作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的原因，主要是因为它们提供了更经济、耐用且环保的选择。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，重点在于通过改变载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载来优化催化剂性能。这些因素影响着催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，从而影响其活性、稳定性和对目标产物的择优性。例如，在500至540°C的温度范围内，调整丙烷/氧气的比例会直接影响脱氢效率，这表明可以通过调整催化剂设计参数来实现最佳转化率和选择性。
