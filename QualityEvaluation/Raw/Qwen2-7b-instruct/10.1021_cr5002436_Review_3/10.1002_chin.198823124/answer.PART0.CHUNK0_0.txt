1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the desire to find more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and potentially more selective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability through modifications such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.
2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the change in the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 at temperatures ranging from 500-540°C resulted in a decrease in propane conversion (from 33% to 23%) and an increase in the selectivity of propene formation (from 43% to 53%).

1. 对于烷烃脱氢，以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)的替代品被探索的原因是寻找更经济、环保且可能更具选择性的催化剂。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，着重于通过载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等修改来提高催化活性、选择性和稳定性。
2. 载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，在500-540°C的温度范围内，将丙烷/O2的比例从1:2改变为1:1导致丙烷转化率从33%下降到23%，丙烯形成的选择性从43%增加到53%。
