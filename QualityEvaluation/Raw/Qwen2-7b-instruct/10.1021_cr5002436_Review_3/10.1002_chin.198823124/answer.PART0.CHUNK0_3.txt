Answer: The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the desire for more cost-effective, stable, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the properties of these catalysts through modifications such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These adjustments aim to enhance the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity of the vanadium species involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts, leading to improved performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.
