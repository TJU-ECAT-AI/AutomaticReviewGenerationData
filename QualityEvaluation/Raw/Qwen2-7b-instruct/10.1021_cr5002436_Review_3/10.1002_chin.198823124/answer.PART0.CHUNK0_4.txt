The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the nature and behavior of vanadium species through various factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors influence the catalyst's performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. For instance, at temperatures ranging from 500 to 540°C, changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 led to a decrease in propane conversion (from 33% to 23%) and an increase in propene formation selectivity (from 43% to 53%).

探索以二氧化钒为基础的催化剂作为正构烷烃脱氢的替代品，是出于对更高效、成本效益更高的催化剂的需求。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已显著发展，重点优化了钒物种的性质，通过载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等各个因素。这些因素影响着催化剂的性能，包括活性、选择性和稳定性。例如，在500至540°C的温度范围内，将丙烷/O2的比例从1:2改为1:1，导致丙烷转化率下降（从33%降至23%），丙烯形成的选择性提高（从43%增至53%）。
