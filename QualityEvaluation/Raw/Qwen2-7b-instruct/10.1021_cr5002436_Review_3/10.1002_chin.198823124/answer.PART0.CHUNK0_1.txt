1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the search for more cost-effective, stable, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s with advancements in understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.
2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of the metal, support surface area impacts the active sites available for reaction, and metal loading determines the concentration of active catalytic sites per unit volume, all of which significantly impact the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process.
