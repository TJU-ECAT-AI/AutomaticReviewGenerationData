1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the desire to find more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and potentially more selective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability through modifications such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.
2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the change in the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 at temperatures ranging from 500-540°C resulted in a decrease in propane conversion (from 33% to 23%) and an increase in the selectivity of propene formation (from 43% to 53%).
