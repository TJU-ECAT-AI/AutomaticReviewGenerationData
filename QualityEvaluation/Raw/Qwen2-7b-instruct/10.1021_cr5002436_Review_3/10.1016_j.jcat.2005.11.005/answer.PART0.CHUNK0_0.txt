[1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals [1,2]."
[2] "Currently, the most feasible processes on a commercial scale are catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes [1,38]."
[3] "They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane [1115], and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions."
[4] "However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered; for example, the structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions are unclear."
[5] "Because these V/θ-Al2O3 samples feature a wide distribution of different surface VOx species, a study of butane DH catalyzed by them may identify a structurereactivity correlation, specifically, a structurecoke formation relationship."
[6] "We expect that a better understanding of coke formation chemistry and the role of different VOx species in coke formation during butane DH can be reached, which will facilitate optimization of the catalysts and possible reduction of side reactions leading to coke."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the growing demand for light olefins and the limitations of existing production methods through steam and catalytic cracking. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on developing active and selective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane. However, the structure of vanadium species in these catalysts, the mechanism of deactivation and coke formation under dehydrogenation conditions, and the influence of various parameters such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the catalyst's performance remain unclear. Studies on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different surface VOx densities aim to establish a correlation between structure and reactivity, specifically linking the structure of VOx species to coke formation during butane dehydrogenation. This improved understanding could facilitate catalyst optimization and reduce unwanted side reactions that lead to coke formation.

对于轻烯烃的需求增长以及蒸汽裂解和催化裂解现有生产方法的产能不足，推动了对轻烷烃脱氢的替代方式的研究。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究不断发展，致力于开发活性和选择性催化剂用于轻烷烃如丙烷和丁烷的脱氢。然而，支持型VOx催化剂中钒物种的结构、脱氢条件下失活和焦炭沉积的机制以及载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等参数对催化剂性能的影响仍然不明确。针对不同表面VOx密度的V/θ-Al2O3催化剂的研究旨在建立结构与反应性的相关性，特别是将VOx物种的结构与丁烷脱氢过程中的焦炭形成联系起来。通过加深对焦炭形成化学和不同VOx物种在焦炭形成过程中作用的理解，可以促进催化剂优化并减少导致焦炭形成的副反应。
