<p>The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals.</p>
<p>Commercial catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal.</p>
<p>In both systems, the catalytic dehydrogenation reaction is accompanied by various competing reactions, including significant carbon laydown, resulting in catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been studied extensively.</p>
<p>They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including propane and butane.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>The nature and amount of coke formed are related to the structure of VOx species.</p>
<p>Monovanadates make chain-like polyaromatics, whereas polyvanadates produce mainly sheet-like (two-dimensional) polyaromatics that are detrimental to catalytic activity.</p>

Research in the use of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation gained momentum due to the growing demand for light olefins and the limitations of steam and catalytic cracking processes. The exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts started in earnest in the 1980s, with extensive studies focusing on their use in dehydrogenating light alkanes like propane and butane. The challenge of catalyst deactivation, particularly through the formation of coke species, has been a critical focus in this research. The coke species' nature and quantity are influenced by the structure of the vanadium oxide species present on the catalyst's surface. Monovanadates lead to the formation of chain-like polyaromatics, while polyvanadates yield predominantly sheet-like (two-dimensional) polyaromatics, which are less favorable for catalytic activity.

对范德华氧化物催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品在轻烷烃脱氢中的研究，受到了对轻烯烃需求的增长以及蒸汽和催化裂解过程产能不足的推动。自1980年代起，对这些催化剂的研究开始兴起，重点集中在它们用于脱氢轻烷烃（如丙烷和丁烷）方面。催化剂活性的降低，尤其是由于焦炭物种的形成导致的，一直是这一研究领域的关键关注点。焦炭物种的性质和数量与催化剂表面的范德华氧化物种结构有关。单范德华酸盐导致链状多芳烃的形成，而多范德华酸盐主要产生二维（平面）多芳烃，这不利于催化活性。
