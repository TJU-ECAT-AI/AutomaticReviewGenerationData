[1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals."
[2] "Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal."
[3] "They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane."
[4] "For example, depending on the pretreatment methods, V/Al2O3 can catalyze the DH of butanes at 853 K with conversion up to about 50% and selectivity to 90%."
[5] "Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions."
[6] "However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered."
[7] "We expect that a better understanding of coke formation chemistry and the role of different VOx species in coke formation during butane DH can be reached, which will facilitate optimization of the catalysts and possible reduction of side reactions leading to coke."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the growing demand for light olefins and the limited capacity of traditional steam and catalytic cracking processes. Since the 1980s, studies have expanded to include the use of vanadium oxides in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes like propane and butane. The use of vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly supported on aluminum oxide, has shown promise in achieving high conversions and selectivities for dehydrogenation reactions. However, the deactivation of these catalysts through coke formation is a significant issue that requires further investigation. The goal is to enhance the understanding of the chemistry behind coke formation and the role of vanadium species in this process, which could lead to improved catalyst design and reduced side reactions causing coke formation.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物在烷烃脱氢中的替代品的研究，是受到对轻烯烃日益增长的需求以及传统蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程产能有限的驱动。自20世纪80年代以来，研究领域已扩展至包括丙烷和丁烷等轻烷烃的脱氢使用。特别是通过在铝氧化物上负载，范德华氧化物催化剂显示出在脱氢反应中实现高转化率和选择性的潜力。然而，催化剂的失活主要是由于焦炭形成，这是一个需要进一步研究的关键问题。目标是提高焦炭形成化学及其在脱氢过程中范德华物种的作用的理解，这可能有助于催化剂设计的改进并减少导致焦炭形成的副反应。
