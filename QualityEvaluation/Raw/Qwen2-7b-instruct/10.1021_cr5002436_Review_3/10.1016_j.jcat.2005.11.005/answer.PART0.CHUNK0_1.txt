[1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals [1,2]."
[2] "Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal [9,10]."
[3] "They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane [1115], and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions."
[4] "However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered; for example, the structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions are unclear."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation is driven by the growing demand for light olefins and the inefficiency of current steam and catalytic cracking processes. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on catalysts that can effectively convert light alkanes like propane and butane into olefins while maintaining selectivity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. However, the structure of supported vanadium oxide and the mechanism of deactivation or coke deposition under dehydrogenation conditions are still unclear, leaving many unanswered questions in this field.

对范德华氧化物催化剂的研究作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品用于轻烷烃脱氢，是由于对轻烯烃的日益增长的需求以及当前蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程效率不足的驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，专注于能够有效将轻烷烃如丙烷和丁烷转化为烯烃并保持选择性的催化剂。载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。然而，支持的钒氧化物的结构和在脱氢条件下沉积结焦的机制仍然不清楚，这一领域仍存在许多未解答的问题。
