[1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals."
[2] "Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal."
[3] "Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions."
[4] "For example, depending on the pretreatment methods, V/Al2O3 can catalyze the DH of butanes at 853 K with conversion up to about 50% and selectivity to 90%."
[5] "Because these V/θ-Al2O3 samples feature a wide distribution of different surface VOx species, a study of butane DH catalyzed by them may identify a structurereactivity correlation, specifically, a structurecoke formation relationship."
[6] "We expect that a better understanding of coke formation chemistry and the role of different VOx species in coke formation during butane DH can be reached, which will facilitate optimization of the catalysts and possible reduction of side reactions leading to coke."
[7] "The focus of this study is to investigate the structure of surface VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy."
[8] "Our recent study [16] suggested the existence of three types of VOx speciesmonovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5on the surface of θ-Al2O3."
[9] "The distribution of these VOx species depends on the surface VOx density."
[10] "Because these V/θ-Al2O3 samples feature a wide distribution of different surface VOx species, a study of butane DH catalyzed by them may identify a structurereactivity correlation, specifically, a structurecoke formation relationship."
[11] "The nature and amount of coke formed in butane DH follows this sequence: polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > V2O5, Al2O3."
[12] "Although the surface of V/θ-Al2O3 is partially reduced under butane DH conditions, the structure of VOx species can be fully regenerated by oxidation of the coke species at temperatures up to 873 K."
[13] "The focus of this study is to investigate the structure of surface VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy."
[14] "In the Raman study of butane DH, the sample was first either calcined (5% O2/N2, 60 ml/min) at 823 K or reduced (5% H2/N2, 60 ml/min) at 873 K for 60 min in the fluidized-bed reactor, and then purged with He (60 ml/min) for 10 min before being exposed to 3% butane/N2 (60 ml/min) at different temperatures (373873 K) for 30 min."
[15] "The spectra collected at reaction temperature are nearly identical to those collected at room temperature except for the difference in band intensities due to thermal effects."
[16] "The decrease in activity is due mainly to the formation of coke deposits and blocking of surface sites throughout the reaction, as determined by Raman studies."
[17] "The selectivity plot of C4 olefins, including 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene, features a volcano shape as a function of surface VOx density, with a peak value observed on the 1.2V sample."
[18] "Among all VOx catalysts, 1.2V gives the highest olefin selectivity, with a stable value of ca. 76%."
[19] "Clearly, the 1.2V catalyst has the best performance among the V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts studied for butane DH in terms of activity, stability, and selectivity."
[20] "The band at 1165 cm1 is attributable to CH bending, and the other two are due to ring stretching in polyaromatic compounds."
[21] "The decrease in relative intensity of the bands due to VOx species compared with θ-Al2O3 suggests that the surface VOx species are partially reduced in H2 at 873 K."
[22] "It seems that the initial oxidation state of surface VOx species does not affect the nature of coke species formed in butane DH."
[23] "This result is consistent with reduction of the oxidized VOx sample under butane DH at 873 K."
[24] "At a reaction temperature of 873 K, new bands due to coke species develop: a weak band at 1165 cm1, a broad feature at 1360 cm1, and an intense one at 1603 cm1."
[25] "The band at 1165 cm1 is attributable to CH bending, and the other two are due to ring stretching in polyaromatic compounds."
[26] "The intensity of the Raman bands below 1500 cm1 decreases significantly."
[27] "The intensity ratio of IG to ID increases as a function of surface VOx density."
[28] "It suggests that the coke species are more hydrogen-deficient on V/θ-Al2O3 with high surface VOx densitynamely, more 2D, sheet-like coke species are formed from butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 with high surface VOx density (>1.2 V/nm2)."
[29] "Very weak bands at 1400 and 1605 cm1 due to coke species are produced only at a reaction temperature of 873 K."
[30] "This suggests that V2O5 is not the main site making coke in butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts."
[31] "The reduction of crystalline V2O5 at lower temperature on 14.2V compared with bulk V2O5 is likely due to the smaller crystal size of the well-dispersed V2O5 on the support, in agreement with previous TPR results [16]."
[32] "It is interesting to see that the Raman bands at 851, 1005, 1186, 1432,1500, and 1600 cm1 appear and grow simultaneously with increasing doses of butane while the bands at 915 and 1021 cm1 due to surface VOx species vanish gradually."
[33] "Because C4 olefins (1-butene, 2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene) are detected from butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts in the reactivity tests,a Raman study of their reactions with the supported VOx catalysts can be expected not only to help assign the set of Raman bands, but also to provide information on which of these olefins are the coke precursors."
[34] "These spectral features from 1-butene DH are very similar to those observed from butane DH on the 1.2V sample, suggesting that similar coke species are formed from both 1-butene reaction and butane DH with increasing reaction temperature."
[35] "The band near 1640 cm1, formed on adsorption of 1-butene and 2-butenes at low temperature, may be from surface butadiene species because this band is also observed in both gaseous and adsorbed 1,3-butadiene (Fig. 9C)."
[36] "Raman spectra after 1,3-butadiene reaction on the 1.2V sample (Fig. 9C) also consist of the set of Raman bands at 850,1006, 1181, 1446, 1502, and 1605 cm1 for reaction temperatures above 573 K."
[37] "Thus, 1,3-butadiene also contributes to the coke formation in the butane DH reaction on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts."
[38] "Comparison of spectrum c to that reported for polystyrene [35] confirms the identity of spectrum c; the set of Raman bands near 850, 1002, 1183, 1437, 1501,and 1603 cm1 is due to polystyrene."
[39] "Thus, it appears that polystyrene is a key intermediate in the coke formation process during butane DH on the 1.2V catalyst."
[40] "The Raman spectra of bulk vanadium oxides, including V2O5, V6O13, VO2, and V2O3, were measured in our lab, and none gave a band at ca. 906 cm1."
[41] "The intensity ratio of IG to ID increases as a function of surface VOx density."
[42] "It suggests that the coke species are more hydrogen-deficient on V/θ-Al2O3 with high surface VOx densitynamely, more 2D, sheet-like coke species are formed from butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 with high surface VOx density (>1.2 V/nm2)."
[43] "The decrease in intensity of the Raman bands due to surface VOx species on the 0.03V sample in butane DH at 873 K (Fig. 3) indicates the reduction of VOx species, consistent with other Raman studies on alkane dehydrogenation over supported vanadia catalysts [5,27,28,30]."
[44] "Although the vanadia phase associated with this band has not been identified, its presence is an indication that vanadia species undergo reduction during butane dehydrogenation."
[45] "The similarity of coke species formed on both preoxidized and prereduced samples (i.e., their similar coke formation chemistry) suggests that the surface VOx species are in a reduced state under butane DH conditions."
[46] "The structure of the VOx species can be regenerated after the oxidative removal of coke deposits (see Fig. 10), and the coke removal temperature is a function of the VOx density."
[47] "It appears that a large portion of the coke is located on the support for V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with low VOx density and thus is difficult to oxidize, whereas more coke deposits onto VOx clusters as the VOx density increases."
[48] "The latter coke species can be easily oxidized because VOx clusters are obviously better than Al2O3 in oxidation reactions."
[49] "The change in location of coke species on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different VOx density is consistent with the selectivity increase observed in the reactivity tests (Fig. 1B)."
[50] "Insights into the coke formation process in butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts are made possible in this work by Raman studies of the reactions of butane, 1-butene, cis/trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene at different temperatures."
[51] "Comparison of the Raman spectra (Fig. 9) from 1-butene, 2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene reactions with those from butane DH suggests that these C4 olefins are possible coke precursors in butane DH."
[52] "Based on these observations, a coke formation pathway in butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 can be proposed as follows:"
[53] "CCCC"
[54] "dehydrogenation"
[55] "C=CCC,"
[56] "CC=CC"
[57] "dehydrogenation"
[58] "C=CC=C"
[59] "cyclization"
[60] "polymerization"
[61] "further cyclization/ condensation"
[62] "1D, 2D polyaromatics."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the structure-reactivity relationships and the mechanism of coke formation on these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

2. The structure-reactivity relationship in the dehydrogenation of butane on vanadium oxide catalysts was established through reactive and UV Raman investigations. The nature and amount of coke formed depend on the structure of the vanadium oxide catalysts. Polymers of vanadium oxide produce 2D-like coke deposits, while monomers produce chainlike coke deposits. Catalysts with more polyvanadates deactivate faster than those with more monovanadates due to the formation of more 2D-like coke deposits.

3. The amount of coke formed in butane dehydrogenation follows this sequence: polymers of vanadium oxide > monomers of vanadium oxide > vanadium pentoxide, alumina.

4. Insights into the coke formation process in butane dehydrogenation on vanadium oxide catalysts were made possible by Raman studies of the reactions of butane, 1-butene, cis/trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene at different temperatures. Polystyrene was identified as a key intermediate in the coke formation process, with 1-butene, 2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene acting as potential coke precursors.

5. Surface vanadium oxide species are in a reduced state under butane dehydrogenation conditions. The structure of vanadium oxide species can be fully regenerated by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873 K.

6. The study provides a better understanding of the coke formation chemistry and the role of different vanadium oxide species in coke formation during butane dehydrogenation, facilitating the optimization of catalysts and potentially reducing side reactions leading to coke.

7. The coke formation pathway in butane dehydrogenation on vanadium oxide catalysts involves the dehydrogenation of butane to form alkenes, followed by alkene dehydrogenation to form alkenes, further alkene dehydrogenation to form alkynes, cyclization, polymerization, further cyclization/condensation, resulting in the formation of 1D or 2D polyaromatics.

5. 丁烷脱氢条件下的表面钒氧化物物种处于还原状态。在氧化去除焦炭沉积物后，结构可以完全恢复，直到873 K。

6. 研究提供了对丁烷脱氢过程中焦炭形成化学的更好理解以及不同钒氧化物物种在焦炭形成中的作用，有助于催化剂的优化并可能减少导致焦炭的副反应。
