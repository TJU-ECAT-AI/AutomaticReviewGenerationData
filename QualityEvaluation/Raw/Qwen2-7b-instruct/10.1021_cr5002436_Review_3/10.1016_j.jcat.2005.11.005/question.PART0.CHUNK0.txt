Studies of butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various distributions of surface VOx species identify a structurecoke relationship. The deactivation of the catalysts in butane DH is due mainly to the formation of coke species. Both the nature and amount of coke formed are related to the structure of VOx species. Monovanadates make chain-like polyaromatics, whereas polyvanadates produce mainly sheet-like (two-dimensional) polyaromatics that are detrimental to catalytic activity. The amount of coke formed from butane DH follows this sequence: polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > V2O5, Al2O3. Raman spectroscopy studies of butane, 1-butene, cis/trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene reactions on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts enable the formulation of a coke formation pathway for butane DH, in which polystyrene is found to be a key intermediate. Although the surface of V/θ-Al2O3 is partially reduced under butane DH conditions, the structure of VOx species can be fully regenerated by oxidation of the coke species at temperatures up to 873 K. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic crack- ing are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals [1,2]. Currently, the most feasible processes on a commercial scale are catalytic dehydro- genation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes [1,38]. Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal [9,10]. In both systems, the catalytic DH reaction is accompanied by vari- ous competing reactions, including significant carbon laydown,resulting in catalyst deactivation. The possibility of using ox- ide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkaneolefin conversion process more selective and stable.

ODH of light alkanes have been studied extensively [1,38].
They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, in- cluding propane and butane [1115], and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions. For example, de- pending on the pretreatment methods, V/Al2O3 can catalyze the DH of butanes at 853 K with conversion up to about 50% and selectivity to 90% [13]. Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx cata- lysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions. However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions re- main unanswered; for example, the structure of supported VOx and the mechanism of deactivation/coke deposition under DH conditions are unclear.
The focus of this study is to investigate the structure of sur- face VOx and the coke formation process during butane DH over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities (0.0314.2 V/nm2) using in situ UV Raman spectroscopy. Our recent study [16] suggested the existence of three types of VOx speciesmonovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5on the sur- face of θ-Al2O3.

Monovanadate is the only species on the sample with VOx density 0.16 V/nm2; poly- vanadates coexist with monovanadate on samples with a surface VOx density of 1.2 V/nm2, and a mixture of monovanadate,polyvanadates and crystalline V2O5 is found on samples with surface VOx density >1.2 V/nm2. Because these V/θ-Al2O3 samples feature a wide distribution of different surface VOx species, a study of butane DH catalyzed by them may identify a structurereactivity correlation, specifically, a structurecoke formation relationship. We expect that a better understanding of coke formation chemistry and the role of different VOx species in coke formation during butane DH can be reached, which will facilitate optimization of the catalysts and possible reduction of side reactions leading to coke.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All V/θ-Al2O3 samples with surface VOx density in the range 0.0314.2 V/nm2 were prepared via incipient wet- ness impregnation of θ-Al2O3 (Johnson Matthey; SBET = 101 m2/g) with aqueous NH4VO3 (99+%, Aldrich) solutions.Oxalic acid (99%, Aldrich) [NH4VO3/oxalic acid = 0.5 (mo- lar ratio)] was added into the solutions for high VOx loadings to ensure the dissolution of NH4VO3. A V/θ-Al2O3 sample with surface VOx density of Y V/nm2 is denoted by YV in what follows. After impregnation, the samples were dried at room temperature by purging with air, heated at 393 K overnight, and finally calcined at 823 K for 6 h in air.
2.2. Raman studies
In situ UV (244 nm) Raman studies of butane DH on various V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts were conducted on a Raman instrument built at Northwestern University [17,18]. Some of the Raman spectra were collected on a Triax 550 single-grating spectro- graph with a UV-enhanced CCD detector. A UV edge filter (Barr Associates) was used to block Rayleigh scattering. The 244-nm excitation is produced by a Lexel 95 SHG (second har- monic generation) laser equipped with an intracavity nonlinear crystal, BBO (beta barium borate; BaB2O4), which frequency doubles visible radiation into the mid-ultraviolet region. Raman spectra were collected under a controlled atmosphere using a fluidized bed reactor described previously [19]. The laser power and spot size at the sample position were ca. 2 mW and 50 m,respectively. Data collection times varied from 60 s to 4 h, de- pending on the signal level. The Raman shift was calibrated by measuring several liquid standards, including cyclohexane, ace- tonitrile, acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate, toluene, and ben- zene. A mathematical procedure involving a quadratic fit of the observed to the actual wavenumbers of the standards was used for the calibration. The band positions in the Raman spectra were determined using the program PeakFit v4.11.
In the Raman study of butane DH, the sample was first ei- ther calcined (5% O2/N2, 60 ml/min) at 823 K or reduced (5% H2/N2, 60 ml/min) at 873 K for 60 min in the fluidized-bed reactor, and then purged with He (60 ml/min) for 10 min be- fore being exposed to 3% butane/N2 (60 ml/min) at different temperatures (373873 K) for 30 min. The sample was then purged with He at reaction temperature for another 10 min,to remove any adsorbed hydrocarbon species before spectral measurements. Raman spectra were collected at both reaction temperature and room temperature in flowing He (150 ml/min).
The spectra collected at reaction temperature are nearly identi- cal to those collected at room temperature except for the differ- ence in band intensities due to thermal effects [20]. All of the spectra shown here were collected at room temperature. Each experiment was conducted in a sequence of measurements after progressively higher temperature treatments. Raman studies of 3% 1-butene/N2, 3% cis-2-butene/N2, 3% trans-2-butene/N2,and 1.4% 1,3-butadiene/N2 on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts were con- ducted using the same procedure as for butane DH. After reac- tion at 873 K, the catalyst was usually oxidized in a 2% O2/N2 flow (60 ml/min) in the fluidized bed reactor at different tem- peratures (473873 K) for 1 h. Raman spectra of the reoxidized catalyst were then collected at room temperature in flowing He.
2.3. Activity test and temperature-programmed oxidation
(TPO)
Due to the large void volume of the fluidized-bed reactor used in the Raman studies, a U-shaped microreactor was used in tests of V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts for butane DH activity. The sample (ca. 0.3 g) was heated to 873 K in 5% O2/N2 (60 ml/min) and held at this temperature for 2 h. After calcination, the sample was purged with He to remove all oxygen in the system and then exposed to a 1.5% butane/N2 stream with a total flow rate of 120 ml/min. The reaction was usually run for 90 min. On- line gas analysis was performed using an Agilent 3000 Micro GC equipped with a Plot U, a Molsieve 5A, and an Alumna Plot column and TCD detectors. It takes about 10 min for the gas flow to be stabilized in the reaction system for GC analysis and each sampling runs for 160 s. Negligible conversion (<2%) of butane was observed in the gas phase and on θ-Al2O3 at 873 K.After activity tests, the coked catalyst was purged with He at reaction temperature for another 10 min and then cooled to room temperature in He. Temperature-programmed oxida- tion (TPO) of the catalyst was then conducted in a 5% O2/N2 (60 ml/min) flow with a heating rate of 5 K/min. O2, CO2, and CO components were monitored during the TPO process us- ing the Agilent 3000 Micro gas chromatograph. The amount of coke is expressed as monolayers. Assuming that the coke is pure carbon (hydrogenated carbon will make little difference to the calculation), a monolayer of coke on the catalyst sur- face corresponds to 1019 C-atom/m2 (this is the value for most solids) [21]. The monolayer of coke is calculated with respect to the available surface area of Al2O3 in each catalyst. 222

3. Results
3.1. Catalytic performance of V/θ-Al2O3 for butane DH
The V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface VOx densities of
0.0314.2 V/nm2 were tested for butane DH at 873 K. The ac-
tivity and selectivity data on different catalysts plus bulk V2O5 are compared in Fig. 1. The initial activity increases as a func- tion of surface VOx density up to 8 V/nm2 and then declines on the 14.2V catalyst, and further declines on bulk V2O5. With prolonged time on stream (i.e., DH for 60 min), butane conver- sion decreases dramatically on the catalysts with surface VOx density >1.2 V/nm2, whereas it remains nearly unchanged on those catalysts with surface VOx density 1.2 V/nm2. The decrease in activity is due mainly to the formation of coke de- posits and blocking of surface sites throughout the reaction,as determined by Raman studies. The selectivity plot of C4 olefins, including 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene, features a volcano shape as a function of surface VOx density, with a peak value observed on the 1.2V sample.
Other reaction products from butane DH are C1C3 hydrocar- bons from cracking, COx, and carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. The C4 olefins are distributed as follows: 1,3-butadiene > 1-butene trans-2-butene > cis-2-butene. Using thermo- dynamic data from the literature [22,23], the thermodynamic conversion at 900 K is close to 100%, and the selectivity to C4 olefins follows the sequence: 1,3-butadiene > trans-2-butene > cis-2-butene 1-butene. The differences between the calcu- lated and measured partial pressures indicate that the reaction has not reached thermodynamic equilibrium. The C4= selectiv- ity increases on all catalysts as the reaction time increases from 10 to 60 min. A rather stable value of selectivity is actually obtained after 30 min. Among all VOx catalysts, 1.2V gives the highest olefin selectivity, with a stable value of ca. 76%.
Clearly, the 1.2V catalyst has the best performance among the Fig. 2. Raman spectra of butane DH on θ-Al2O3 at different temperatures.

3.2. Raman study of butane DH
3.2.1. Butane DH on θ-Al2O3
Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra after butane DH on pure θ-Al2O3 at different temperatures. The Raman bands below 900 cm1 are due to θ-Al2O3, and their intensity remains es- sentially unchanged on butane DH at increasing temperatures.
New bands at 1625 and 1403 cm1 observed at reaction tem- peratures of 673873 K are due to hydrocarbon deposits formed from the reaction. The two bands can be assigned to the C=C stretch and CH deformation, respectively, characteristic of olefin/polyolefin species [18,2426]. Considering the relative intensity of the bands due to coke species compared with those of the θ-Al2O3 support, the amount of coke deposited is quite small, as was confirmed in the TPO studies.
3.2.2. Butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 Catalysts
Raman studies of butane DH were conducted on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface VOx density of 0.0314.2 V/nm2. Ra- man spectra from three representative V/θ-Al2O3 samples with different distributions of surface VOx species were selected to for discussion here: the 0.03V sample with only monovana- date on the surface, the 1.2V sample with monovanadate and polyvanadates, and the 14.2V sample with a mixture of mono- vanadate, polyvanadates, and crystalline V2O5.
Fig. 3A shows the Raman spectra of the oxidized 0.03V sam- ple after butane DH at different temperatures. The bands at 910 and 1014 cm1 on the oxidized sample are due to surface VOx species and are assigned to VOAl and V=O vibrations, re- spectively [16]. The bands due to VOx species and θ-Al2O3 show intensity changes only at a reaction temperature of 873 K.
The decrease in intensity of bands due to VOx species at 873 K is likely due to a combination of VOx reduction [5,2730] and optical absorption by coke species. The Raman bands due to coke species observed below 873 K at 1613 and 1410 cm1 are

223 Fig. 3. Raman spectra of butane DH on (A) oxidized and (B) prereduced 0.03V at different temperatures. due to polyolefins/polyaromatics. At a reaction temperature of 873 K, new bands due to coke species develop: a weak band at 1165 cm1, a broad feature at 1360 cm1, and an intense one at 1603 cm1. The band at 1165 cm1 is attributable to CH bending, and the other two are due to ring stretching in polyaromatic compounds [2432]. Fig. 3B presents the Raman spectra from butane DH on a reduced 0.03V sample at different temperatures. The 873 K-reduced 0.03V sample gives a Ra- man band due to the V=O stretch at 1013 cm1, whereas the band due to VOAl observed on an oxidized sample is hardly detectable. The decrease in relative intensity of the bands due to VOx species compared with θ-Al2O3 suggests that the sur- face VOx species are partially reduced in H2 at 873 K. When subjected to butane DH at high temperatures, the prereduced sample produces similar Raman bands due to coke species as those on its oxidized counterpart (cf. Figs. 3A and B). It seems that the initial oxidation state of surface VOx species does not affect the nature of coke species formed in butane DH. This re- Fig. 4. Raman spectra of butane DH on oxidized 1.2V at different temperatures. sult is consistent with reduction of the oxidized VOx sample under butane DH at 873 K.
The Raman spectra collected after butane DH at differ- ent temperatures on the oxidized 1.2V sample are shown in Fig. 4. At temperatures below 673 K, a weak Raman band at 1620 cm1, assigned to C=C stretching in polyolefins, is ob- served together with the two bands at 1021 and 915 cm1 due to V=O and VOAl modes of surface VOx species, respec- tively. After butane DH at 673 and 773 K, an intense band at 1601 cm1 due to polyaromatic hydrocarbons develops. Simul- taneously, bands at 1500, 1438, 1183, 1004, and 845 cm1 are also observed. Meanwhile, Raman bands at 1021 and 915 cm1 from surface VOx species are no longer observable, due to a combination of the reduction of VOx species [5,2730] and the strong optical absorption by surface coke species. The band at 1500 cm1 is usually assigned to conjugated polyolefins or cy- clopentadienyl species [24,33]. The band at 1438 cm1 is due to the bending mode of CH3/CH2 or CH in aromatic rings.
CH bending in aromatics usually appears near 1180 cm1.
The two sharp bands at 1004 and 845 cm1 are rarely reported for coke species in the literature and thus might be ascribed to surface VOx species. However, the absence of an isotope shift on an 18O-exchanged V/θ-Al2O3 sample confirms that these bands are due to surface coke deposits. As the DH temperature is increased to 873 K, the intensity of the Raman bands below 1500 cm1 decreases significantly. Raman spectra obtained af- ter the reaction of butane with prereduced 1.2V (not shown) are very similar to those on preoxidized 1.2V. This again suggests that the initial valence state of surface VOx does not affect the nature of coke species, and most likely the VOx species is partly reduced under butane DH conditions. This conclusion can also be inferred from the similar activity/selectivity results from bu- tane DH tests on either oxidized or prereduced 1.2V (not shown here).
Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of butane DH on the oxi- dized 14.2V sample at different temperatures. In addition to the bands at 1026 and 915 cm1 due to dispersed surface VOx, Ra- man bands due to crystalline V2O5 are also observed at 995,706, 518, and 483 cm1. Reduction of surface VOx species 224

Fig. 5. Raman spectra of butane DH on oxidized 14.2V at different tempera- tures. occurs when the sample reacts with butane at 573 K. Raman bands due to V2O5 disappear, and the band at 1026 cm1 be- comes weaker. A new strong band at 906 cm1 dominates the spectrum. This band is likely due to VOx species produced by the reduction of V2O5 by butane. This is confirmed in the spec- tra from butane DH on V2O5 (see Fig. 7). Weak features due to coke species are also present at 1180, 1434, and 1605 cm1 at this reaction temperature. When the reaction was carried out at 673 K, the spectrum becomes very similar to that from butane DH on the 1.2V sample at this temperature. The set of bands at 850, 1006, 1181, 1434, 1502, and 1605 cm1 is present. An- other similarity to the 1.2V sample is the weakening of the bands below 1600 cm1 relative to the band at 1605 cm1 with increasing reaction temperature. At 873 K, only the band at 1605 cm1 persists. Butane DH was also conducted on a pre- reduced 14.2V sample, and again, similar Raman features due to coke species were observed as on oxidized 14.2V.
One important general characteristic of coke is its topol- ogy, which can be assessed by the intensity ratio of the band at around 1600 cm1 (G band) to the band at around 1400 cm1 (D band) [24,26]. UV Raman spectra from a series of pol- yaromatic compounds [24,34] show that the intensity in the spectral range 16001650 cm1 is significantly higher than that in the region 13001450 cm1 for coke species with a two-dimensional, sheet-like topology. In contrast, the intensity is more nearly equal in these two spectral regions for coke species with chainlike topologies. The topology of coke species formed from butane DH on the various V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts at 873 K is compared in Fig. 6. The intensity ratio of IG to ID in- creases as a function of surface VOx density. It suggests that the coke species are more hydrogen-deficient on V/θ-Al2O3 with high surface VOx densitynamely, more 2D, sheet-like coke species are formed from butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 with high surface VOx density (>1.2 V/nm2).
3.2.3. Butane DH on V2O5
Bulk V2O5 was also tested for butane DH, and the Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 7. When contacted with butane, the Fig. 6. I G/I D measured from the Raman spectra of butane DH at 873 K as a function of surface VOx density.
Fig. 7. Raman spectra of butane DH on oxidized V2O5 at different tempera- tures.
Raman bands due to V2O5 decrease gradually with increasing temperature and disappear at 873 K, evidence for the reduction of V2O5. A band at 906 cm1 is also observed in the tempera- ture range 673723 K, possibly due to an intermediate species from reduced V2O5. It is seen that very weak bands at 1400 and 1605 cm1 due to coke species are produced only at a reaction temperature of 873 K. Raman spectra of butane DH on a hydrogen-reduced V2O5 sample also show weak Raman features due to coke species. This suggests that V2O5 is not the main site making coke in butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 cata- lysts. The reduction of crystalline V2O5 at lower temperature on 14.2V compared with bulk V2O5 is likely due to the smaller crystal size of the well-dispersed V2O5 on the support, in agree- ment with previous TPR results [16].
3.2.4. Pulse experiment of butane DH

225 Fig. 8. Raman spectra of butane DH on oxidized 1.2V at 673 K with different dosages of butane. esting to see that the Raman bands at 851, 1005, 1186, 1432,1500, and 1600 cm1 appear and grow simultaneously with in- creasing doses of butane while the bands at 915 and 1021 cm1 due to surface VOx species vanish gradually. It appears that these bands are from a single surface coke species. Because C4 olefins (1-butene, 2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene) are detected from butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts in the reactivity tests,a Raman study of their reactions with the supported VOx cata- lysts can be expected not only to help assign the set of Raman bands, but also to provide information on which of these olefins are the coke precursors.
3.3. Raman Study of C4= DH
The reaction of different C4 olefins was investigated on the
1.2V sample. Fig. 9 presents the Raman spectra from 1-butene,
cis/trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene DH on the 1.2V sample.
As shown in Fig. 9A, a band at around 1640 cm1 is present at room temperature and up to 573 K, due to olefinic species on the surface. This band is gradually replaced by a strong band at 1603 cm1 as the reaction temperature rises above 573 K. Meanwhile, bands at 851, 1003, 1173, 1385, 1440, and 1502 cm1 also grow. Raman bands due to surface VOx species are not observable at reaction temperatures above 573 K. These spectral features from 1-butene DH are very similar to those observed from butane DH on the 1.2V sample, suggesting that similar coke species are formed from both 1-butene reaction and butane DH with increasing reaction temperature. Raman spectra from cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene DH on the 1.2V sample are identical, and thus Fig. 9B represents spectra from either of these spectra. These spectra are also very similar to those from 1-butene reaction and butane DH, indicating that the coke species made from of 1-butene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2- butene are similar to those from butane on the 1.2V sample.
This result suggests that a common coke precursor is shared between the DH of butane and the C4 olefins on supported VOx catalysts. The band near 1640 cm1, formed on adsorption of 1-butene and 2-butenes at low temperature, may be from sur- face butadiene species because this band is also observed in both gaseous and adsorbed 1,3-butadiene (Fig. 9C).
Raman spectra after 1,3-butadiene reaction on the 1.2V sam- ple (Fig. 9C) also consist of the set of Raman bands at 850,1006, 1181, 1446, 1502, and 1605 cm1 for reaction temper- atures above 573 K. Thus, 1,3-butadiene also contributes to the coke formation in the butane DH reaction on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts. There are some differences in the temperature behav- ior, however. For example, these bands are already present on room temperature adsorption of 1,3-butadiene on the 1.2V sam- ple. The spectrum of gas-phase 1,3-butadiene is included for comparison. Apparently, 1,3-butadiene reacts on adsorption on the catalyst surface. Considering the low temperature (298 K),a possible chemical change for 1,3-butadiene is its cycliza- tion to form styrene on the surface. Comparing the spectrum (Fig. 9D-a) from styrene to that after butane DH at 673 K on
1.2V (Fig. 9D-b) reveals a very similar set of bands. Also in-
cluded is the spectrum from a mixture of 1.2V with styrene heated at 393 K (Fig. 9D-c). Styrene is known to polymer- ize easily on heating. Comparison of spectrum c to that re- ported for polystyrene [35] confirms the identity of spectrum c; the set of Raman bands near 850, 1002, 1183, 1437, 1501,and 1603 cm1 is due to polystyrene. Thus, it appears that polystyrene is a key intermediate in the coke formation process during butane DH on the 1.2V catalyst.
Reaction of 1,3-butadiene on the other V/θ-Al2O3 samples was also conducted; the Raman spectra show the presence of the polystyrene bands at reaction temperatures above 573 K,suggesting that both monovanadates and polyvanadates make polystyrene from butane DH at high temperatures. A key dif- ference is that these bands are much weaker than those due to either θ-Al2O3 or surface VOx species on samples with lower VOx density than on those with higher VOx density, reflecting the difference in the amount of polystyrene on the surface.
3.4. Oxidation of coke species
Regeneration of the coked V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts was at- tempted by oxidation. This was done both in the fluidized-bed reactor with monitoring by Raman spectroscopy and in the U- shaped reactor with on-line gas chromatography. Fig. 10 gives the Raman spectra of the coked 1.2V sample (after butane DH at 873 K) reoxidized at different temperatures. The bands due to coke species disappear completely after oxidation above 773 K.
Meanwhile, Raman bands due to surface VOx species appear to be completely restored at 873 K, indicating that the catalyst structure is regenerated after coke removal. The reoxidation of other coked V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts shows similar Raman features,except that the coke removal temperature depends on the sur- face VOx density: the higher the surface VOx density, the lower the removal temperature. This is confirmed by the TPO results (Fig. 11A). The main TPO peak shifts from ca. 750 K on the
0.06V sample to 660 K on the 14.2V and V2O5 samples. The

4. Discussion
4.1. Structurecoke relationship
The existing studies of supported VOx catalysts for light alkane DH focused on either the pretreatment or support ef- fects on the DH activity and selectivity [1115]. Coke forma- tion chemistry has rarely been investigated on supported VOx [28] catalysts. The results presented here provide insight into the structurecoke formation relationship in the DH of butane on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts.
The amount and nature of the coke species formed in bu- tane DH depends on the structure of the surface VOx species.
Olefin/polyolefin species are the only coke deposits on the θ-Al2O3 surface at reaction temperature up to 873 K. They are also the main coke species made by V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts

On all V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts, polyaromatics are produced on the surface at 873 K, which is the normal operation temper- ature for DH reactions. But the topology of the polyaromatics on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts varies depending on the surface VOx species (see Fig. 6). The results indicate that the polyaromat- ics become more 2D sheetlike on V/θ-Al2O3 as the surface VOx density increases. Our recent study [16,36] showed that a mixture of monovanadate and polyvanadates is present on V/θ-Al2O3 samples with surface VOx densities >0.16 V/nm2.The polyvanadate species increase in amount (and possibly also in cluster size) as the VOx loading increases and eventually produce crystalline V2O5. Thus, it appears that 2D polyaromat- ics are likely formed on polyvanadates, whereas 1D, chainlike polyaromatics are produced exclusively by monovanadates in the DH of butane at 873 K. The 2D polyaromatics presumably can reorganize into pregraphitic entities that have been demon- strated to be the kind of coke that causes the deactivation of DH catalysts [32,37,38]. Polyaromatic species can also be made by crystalline V2O5 (Fig. 7).
Within this picture, the activity behavior of the V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts in butane DH (Fig. 1A) can be explained. The decline of initial activity for the 14.2V sample is likely due to the for- mation of V2O5 on the surface, because crystalline V2O5 typi- cally has very small surface area. Therefore, the dispersed VOx species are much more active than crystalline V2O5. However,the initially high activity of catalysts with high VOx density (i.e., more polyvanadates) is achieved at the price of fast deac- tivation. The remarkable decline of butane DH activity for V/θ- Al2O3 catalysts with high surface VOx density (>1.2 V/nm2) can be attributed to the formation of detrimental 2D polyaro- matics on polyvanadates, which are the major VOx species on the surface. The stable reactivity performance of the V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface VOx density <1.2 V/nm2 is due to the restricted formation of only chainlike polyaromatics on mono- vanadate. For the 1.2 V sample, our analysis [36] shows that about half of the surface VOx is monovanadate and the other half is polyvanadate. The stable activity of the 1.2V sample may be the result of polyvanadate clusters that are still small in size and diluted by adjacent monovanadate species. This picture is similar to the sulfur passivation effect on PtRe/Al2O3 catalysts [39,40] where rhenium poisoned by sulfur is considered inert and serves to divide the platinum surface into smaller ensem- bles. The transformation of hydrocarbonaceous fragments into pseudographite is impeded in the conversion of n-hexane over these catalysts, and the PtRe/Al2O3 catalyst remains stable. In analogy, we suggest that the dilution effect of monovanadate prevents the formation of 2D polyaromatics on polyvanadates,so that the 1.2V catalyst maintains stable activity under butane DH conditions. As the amount of monovanadate decreases with surface VOx density, and the polyvanadate clusters increase in size and frequency on the support, the catalyst is more prone to form 2D coke species that eventually lead to the deactivation of V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts. Therefore, it appears that an optimal V/θ-Al2O3 catalyst for butane DH should have both size- and proximity-controlled VOx clusters with density as high as pos- sible. Such a catalyst can be both highly active and stable.Although the V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts show deactivation to some extent in butane DH, the selectivity to C4 olefins (1- butene, 2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene) increases with reaction time (see Fig. 1B). Because the C4 olefins selectivity shows a similar trend on both oxidized and prereduced V/θ-Al2O3 cat- alysts in butane DH, the selectivity change cannot be due to the reduction of surface VOx. Rather, it appears that coke de- posits on the surface are beneficial for olefin selectivity, an idea that has also been suggested in previous studies of hydrocar- bon conversions [12,41,42]. Because Lewis acid sites present on θ-Al2O3 tend to catalyze the cracking of butane [15], the blocking of acid sites by coke species could be responsible for the increased selectivity to C4 olefins with time on steam on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with low surface VOx densities. For the samples with high surface VOx densities, the increase in se- 228

lectivity to C4 olefins with reaction time is likely due to the deactivation of surface active sites responsible for total oxida- tion. This suggestion is supported by the observation that an initially high selectivity to COx (ca. 30%) decreases simultane- ously with increasing C4= selectivity on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with high VOx densities.
The amount of coke formed in butane DH is also related to the structure of VOx species, as demonstrated in the quan- tification of the TPO results (Fig. 11). Obviously, the coke amount follows this sequence: polyvanadates > monovanadate > V2O5, θ-Al2O3. The amounts of coke deposited on the cat- alyst surfaces are high enough to cause active site poisoning as well as pore blocking. After 90 min on stream, the coverage of carbon on the catalyst surface ranges from ca. 0.1 monolayer on
0.06V to 3 monolayer on the 14.2V sample. Consequently, it is
reasonable to attribute the deactivation of V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts in butane DH to coke formation.
Structural information about VOx species under butane DH conditions is also obtainable from the results presented here.
The decrease in intensity of the Raman bands due to surface VOx species on the 0.03V sample in butane DH at 873 K (Fig. 3) indicates the reduction of VOx species, consistent with other Raman studies on alkane dehydrogenation over supported vanadia catalysts [5,27,28,30]. When V2O5 is present in the sample (i.e., for 14.2V and bulk V2O5), the reduction is more obvious, as evidenced by the disappearance of the 995-cm1 band and the appearance of a new band at 906 cm1 even at low temperature. The intense band at 906 cm1, which has not been reported in previous Raman studies of supported vana- dia samples under alkane DH [5,27,28,30], is probably due to an intermediate state in the reduction of bulk vanadia, because it disappears at higher reaction temperatures (above 773 K).
The Raman spectra of bulk vanadium oxides, including V2O5, V6O13, VO2, and V2O3, were measured in our lab, and none gave a band at ca. 906 cm1. Although the vanadia phase asso- ciated with this band has not been identified, its presence is an indication that vanadia species undergo reduction during butane dehydrogenation. Although the Raman bands due to surface VOx species are not observable at 873 K due to the presence of coke species on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with higher VOx density,the similarity of coke species formed on both preoxidized and prereduced samples (i.e., their similar coke formation chem- istry) suggests that the surface VOx species are in a reduced state under butane DH conditions. The reduction of surface VOx species is also inferred from the activity tests. During the initial stage of butane DH, a certain amount of COx is detected.
Once this initial period is completed, no significant amount of COx is detected, with most of the observed products being hy- drocarbon species. Thus, one could envisage that the oxidized VOx species undergo a reduction process during the initial stage of butane DH. The structure of the VOx species can be regener- ated after the oxidative removal of coke deposits (see Fig. 10),and the coke removal temperature is a function of the VOx den- sity. It appears that a large portion of the coke is located on the support for V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with low VOx density and thus is difficult to oxidize, whereas more coke deposits onto VOx clusters as the VOx density increases. The latter coke species can be easily oxidized because VOx clusters are obviously bet- ter than Al2O3 in oxidation reactions. The change in location of coke species on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different VOx den- sity is consistent with the selectivity increase observed in the reactivity tests (Fig. 1B).
4.2. Coke formation process in butane DH
Insights into the coke formation process in butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts are made possible in this work by Raman studies of the reactions of butane, 1-butene, cis/trans-2-butenes,and 1,3-butadiene at different temperatures. Comparison of the Raman spectra (Fig. 9) from 1-butene, 2-butenes, and 1,3- butadiene reactions with those from butane DH suggests that these C4 olefins are possible coke precursors in butane DH. The similarity of the Raman spectra between 1-butene, 2-butenes,and 1,3-butadiene at room temperature implies that the adsorp- tion of 1-butene and 2-butenes onto V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts pro- duces adsorbed 1,3-butadiene species. Adsorbed 1,3-butadiene species can be easily cyclized into styrene at low temperature and then polymerized to form polystyrene at elevated reaction temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicat- ing that polystyrene is a key intermediate in the coke formation process in butane DH. As the DH temperature is further in- creased to 873 K, polystyrene species develop further into 1D or 2D polyaromatics, depending on the structure of surface VOx species. Based on these observations, a coke formation pathway in butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 can be proposed as follows:
CCCC
dehydrogenation
C=CCC,
CC=CC
dehydrogenation
C=CC=C
cyclization
polymerization
further cyclization/ condensation
1D, 2D polyaromatics.
5. Conclusions
A structurecoke relationship was established in the DH of butane on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts by reactivity and UV Raman investigations. Both the nature and amount of coke show a dependence on the structure of the V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts. Pol- yaromatics are the main coke species formed under butane DH conditions at 873 K, but the coke species are 2D-like on poly- meric VOx and chainlike on monomeric VOx. V/θ-Al2O3 cata- lysts with more polyvanadates deactivate faster than those with more monovanadates in butane DH, because of the preferable formation of more 2D-like coke deposits. The amount of coke formed in butane DH follows this sequence: polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > V2O5, Al2O3.
The coke species from butane DH on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts are proposed to form with polystyrene as a key intermediate

Surface VOx species are in a reduced state under butane DH conditions. The structure of VOx species can be fully resumed by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873 K.
