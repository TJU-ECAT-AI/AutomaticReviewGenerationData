4.3 Vanadium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives.
The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium.
In addition, depending on the support, mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or Mg may be formed.
The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form.
Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.
On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts.
On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.
A schematic display of these vanadium species is shown in Figure 21.
Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation.
Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+.
However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+.
V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C.
In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields.
Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.
Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide.
According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation.
An overview of the different VOx catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is shown in Table 5.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns related to Cr usage. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the development of vanadium-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. The nature of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and vanadium oxidation state. Mixed oxides containing aluminum (Al), zirconium (Zr), titanium (Ti), or magnesium (Mg) can be formed depending on the support. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the type of vanadium species present. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are crucial for well-dispersed catalysts, serving as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Acid sites, however, negatively impact catalyst performance by facilitating cracking and coke formation. Two-dimensional polymeric vanadium species (V3+ or V4+) are often cited as the most active for dehydrogenation. Prior to the reaction, vanadium is typically present as V5+, but it is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed to form V4+ and V3+. At higher loadings, V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species through treatment under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is sometimes added to the feed as a mild oxidant to enhance alkene yields. Alumina is a common support material, but silica doping has been found to provide benefits in terms of catalyst stability and activity. Magnesium oxide (MgO) can be added as a promoter or component of a mixed oxide, improving dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation due to its basic nature.

对于石蜡脱氢，寻找铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代催化剂的原因是催化剂中毒、Pt的高成本以及Cr使用的环境问题。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已发展，专注于开发用于氧化脱氢的钨基催化剂。在这些催化剂中，钨物种的性质受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载和钨氧化状态的影响。根据支持，铝（Al）、锆（Zr）、钛（Ti）或镁（Mg）可以形成混合氧化物。表面面积与金属负载比决定了存在的钨物种类型。支持表面的羟基团对分散催化剂至关重要，作为钨前体的锚定位点。然而，酸性位点会负面影响催化剂性能，通过促进裂解和焦炭形成。二维聚集体钨物种（V3+或V4+）通常被认为是脱氢最活跃的物种。在反应之前，钨通常以V5+的形式存在，但通过碳氢化合物流体的还原转化为V4+和V3+。在更高负载下，V2O5晶体会在600°C的氧气气氛处理下重新转变为活性聚集体钨物种。有时会在流体中添加二氧化碳（CO2）作为轻烯烃生成的温和氧化剂。氧化铝是一种常见的支持材料，但是添加硅可以提供稳定性与活性方面的益处。镁氧化物（MgO）可以作为促进剂或混合氧化物的成分添加，通过其碱性性质降低焦炭形成，从而提高脱氢选择性。
