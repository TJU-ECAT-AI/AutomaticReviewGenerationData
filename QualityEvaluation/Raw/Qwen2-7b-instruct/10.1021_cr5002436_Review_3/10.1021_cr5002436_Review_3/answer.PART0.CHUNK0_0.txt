(199, 200) The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201) Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant. Therefore, a combination of VO-support, VOV, or VO moieties may be obtained, each having different catalytic activity. In addition, depending on the support, mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or Mg may be formed.
Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings. On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.
Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, (203-206) the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH. Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation. On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation. (30, 206)
Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. (207-209) The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.
V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C. (210) In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. (211-213)
Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity. (214) Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation. (208)
An overview of the different VOx catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is shown in Table 5.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns related to the use of Cr. Research in this area started in the 1980s, focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of the vanadium species present on the catalyst is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. The behavior of these species varies based on their location relative to monolayer coverage: isolated species are present below monolayer coverage, polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored at intermediate coverage, and V2O5 crystallites dominate at higher loadings. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for dispersion, while acid sites can hinder performance by facilitating cracking and coke formation. Two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are often deemed the most active for dehydrogenation, with vanadium species bonded directly to the support being particularly active. Isolated vanadium species show activity but are prone to deactivation due to coke formation. Large V2O5 crystallites are generally inactive in dehydrogenation. The vanadium in these catalysts typically exists as V5+ before reduction by the hydrocarbon feed, which forms V4+ and V3+. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Treating catalysts under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C can revert V2O5 crystallites to active polymeric vanadium species. CO2 is sometimes added to the feed as a mild oxidant to enhance alkene yields. Using silica to dope alumina supports provides benefits for catalyst stability and activity, while adding MgO as a promoter or component of a mixed oxide can improve selectivity by reducing coke formation.

探索以氧化钒（VOx）为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品用于烷烃脱氢的原因是催化剂中毒、铂的成本高昂以及使用Cr对环境的影响。自20世纪80年代以来，研究主要集中在使用钒镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。催化剂中钒物种的存在受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载量和钒的氧化状态等因素的影响。这些物种的行为取决于其相对于单层覆盖的程度：在低于单层覆盖的情况下存在孤立物种，在中间覆盖下倾向于形成聚集体或钒氧化物薄片，而在更高负载量下则为主导的是V2O5晶体。支持表面上的羟基团对于分散至关重要，而酸性位点可能阻碍性能，因为它们促进裂解并导致焦炭形成。二维聚集体的V3+ 或V4+ 物种通常被认为是脱氢反应中最活跃的，直接与支持物结合的钒物种特别活跃。孤立的钒物种表现出活性，但容易因焦炭形成而失活。大的V2O5晶体一般在脱氢过程中不活跃。这些催化剂中的钒通常以V5+ 形式存在，然后被烃类气体还原为V4+ 和V3+。不同类型的分子结构决定了钒物种的可还原性，VOV和VO键比VO支持键更容易被还原。在600°C的氧气气氛下处理催化剂可以将V2O5晶体恢复为活性聚集体钒物种。有时向反应流中添加二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂来提高烯烃产率。通过在铝硅基支持物中掺入二氧化硅可以提供催化剂稳定性和活性的益处，而添加氧化镁作为助剂或混合氧化物的成分可以改善选择性，通过减少焦炭形成降低活性。

催化剂上的钒性质很大程度上取决于载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载量以及钒的氧化状态。在理论单层覆盖度以下，存在孤立的钒物种；在中间覆盖度下，倾向于形成聚集体或钒氧化物薄片；超过单层覆盖度后，V2O5晶体占据主导地位。因此，可以得到VO-support、VOV或VO基团的组合，每种组合具有不同的催化活性。根据支持材料的不同，也可能形成含铝（Al）、锆（Zr）、钛（Ti）或镁（Mg）的混合氧化物。
