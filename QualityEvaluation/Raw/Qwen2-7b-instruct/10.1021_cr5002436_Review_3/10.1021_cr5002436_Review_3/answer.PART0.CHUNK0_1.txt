(199, 200) The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium.
Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings.
The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form.
V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C.
CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields.
Relatively weak basic sites on carriers, such as those present on an activated carbon support, facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction.
Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity.
The first report of the dehydrogenation activity of a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst was of MoO3/Al2O3 in the dehydrocyclization of n-heptane, which was published in 1946.
Optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support.
At loadings above monolayer coverage, the catalyst is more easily reduced, which results in a drop in catalyst activity.
The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide.
Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support.

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns related to the use of Cr. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the synthesis and characterization of vanadium-based catalysts for dehydrogenation. The nature of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the predominant species present on the catalyst. Above a certain loading, V2O5 crystallites dominate, while at lower loadings, polymeric or monomeric vanadium species are more prevalent. Activating agents like CO2 can enhance alkene yields by altering the surface chemistry of the catalyst. Weak basic sites on the support can facilitate beneficial reactions, while strong basic sites can poison the catalyst.

2. Molybdenum oxides are also used as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. The first report of a molybdenum oxide catalyst for dehydrogenation was in 1946. Optimal activity is achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. At higher loadings, the catalyst becomes more easily reduced, leading to a decrease in activity. The addition of promoters like magnesium oxide can improve catalyst performance by reducing coke formation and increasing alkene selectivity. Molybdenum oxycarbides can form during dehydrogenation, leading to a transition in catalyst activity and stability.

3. Gallium oxide-based catalysts have gained renewed interest in recent years for their potential in dehydrogenation reactions. The exact nature of active sites in Ga-based catalysts is under debate, with some suggesting that β-Ga2O3 is the most active species. β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure with weak Lewis acid sites, which are believed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity. The presence of acid sites on the support can influence catalyst performance. The reducibility of Ga2O3 can depend on its interaction with the catalyst support. The addition of CO2 to the feed can improve olefin yields by altering the surface chemistry of the catalyst, though its effect can vary depending on the level of coke deposition. The structure of the support, particularly its porosity, also impacts catalyst performance by influencing coke formation and selectivity.

1. 探索使用二氧化钒作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)的替代品进行烷烃脱氢的原因，主要是由于催化剂中毒、Pt的高昂成本以及Cr使用时的环境问题。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展起来，专注于开发基于二氧化钒的脱氢催化剂。这些催化剂中钒物种的存在受载体类型、支撑表面面积、金属负载和钒的氧化状态的影响。载体面积与金属负载比例决定了催化剂上存在的主要物种。在较高的负载下，V2O5晶粒占主导地位，而在较低的负载下，则是聚集体或单体钒物种更常见。激活剂如二氧化碳可以提高烯烃产率，通过改变催化剂的表面化学性质。支撑上较弱的基本位点可以促进有益反应，而较强的基团则会毒害催化剂。

2. 钼氧化物也常用于烃类转化反应，包括脱氢。最早的钼氧化物催化剂用于脱氢的报告是在1946年。在氧化铝支持下，以单层覆盖度存在的钼氧化物可以获得最佳活性。在较高负载下，催化剂更容易被还原，导致活性下降。添加镁氧化物等促进剂可以改善催化剂性能，通过减少焦炭形成和增加烯烃选择性来增加活性。钼氧化碳在不支持的钼氧化物上形成，导致催化剂活性和稳定性转变。

3. 近年来，镓氧化物基催化剂重新引起了人们的关注，它们可能用于脱氢反应。关于镓基催化剂中活性位点的确切性质存在争议，其中一些人认为β-Ga2O3是最活跃的物种。β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，其中镓原子均匀分布在四面体和八面体配置之间，被认为是脱氢化活性中心。支撑上酸性位点的存在可以影响催化剂性能。镓氧化物的可还原性可能取决于它与催化剂支撑的相互作用。向反应流中添加二氧化碳可以改善烯烃产率，通过改变催化剂的表面化学性质，但其效果会根据焦炭沉积量的不同而变化。支撑的结构，特别是其孔隙性，也会影响催化剂性能，影响焦炭形成和选择性。
