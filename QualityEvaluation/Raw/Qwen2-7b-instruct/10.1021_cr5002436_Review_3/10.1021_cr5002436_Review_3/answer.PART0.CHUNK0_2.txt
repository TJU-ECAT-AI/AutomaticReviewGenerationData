1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns related to Cr usage. Research in this area began in the 1980s, initially focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides. The nature of vanadium in these catalysts is significantly influenced by the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and vanadium oxidation state. The vanadium species present on the catalyst vary based on the loading, with monomeric species below 1.2 V/nm², polymeric species between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm², and crystalline V2O5 species at higher loadings. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface aids in the dispersion of the catalyst, serving as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are often deemed the most active for dehydrogenation. Using silica to dope the alumina support enhances catalyst stability and activity. Adding MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide, improves the performance of supported vanadium catalysts. An overview of various vanadium oxide catalysts utilized for light alkane dehydrogenation is provided in Table 5.

1. 对于石蜡脱氢，寻找Pt和CrOx催化剂替代品的动力源自催化剂中毒、Pt成本高昂以及Cr使用带来的环境问题。该领域的研究始于1980年代，最初专注于使用vanadiummagnesium复合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。催化剂中vanadium的存在受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载以及vanadium氧化状态的显著影响。根据负载的不同，vanadium物种分为以下几种：低于1.2 V/nm²时为单体物种，1.2至4.4 V/nm²时为聚合物物种，高于此值时为V2O5结晶体。支持表面上的羟基集团对于催化剂的分散至关重要，它们充当用于制备这些催化剂的vanadium前体的锚定位点。二维聚合体V3+或V4+物种通常被认为是脱氢作用最活跃的。通过将二氧化硅掺杂到氧化铝支持中，可以增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。向支持vanadium催化剂添加MgO（作为促进剂或混合氧化物的一部分）可以改善其性能。轻烷烃脱氢所使用的各种vanadium氧化物催化剂概述在表5中。
