[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
[2] "Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides."
[3] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium."
[4] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
[5] "A schematic display of these vanadium species is shown in Figure 21."
[6] "Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation."
[7] "Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation."
[8] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[9] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[10] "Molybdenum oxides are also frequently used as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation."
[11] "The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."
[12] "To our knowledge, the first report of the dehydrogenation activity of a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst was of MoO3/Al2O3 in the dehydrocyclization of n-heptane, which was published in 1946."
[13] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[14] "In the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation."
[15] "Indeed, when this catalyst is used for PDH, a conversion of 39% and a selectivity of 85% can be obtained after 150 h of time-on-stream at 580 C, with frequent regenerations at 650 C."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation due to issues like catalyst poisoning, high costs associated with Pt, and environmental concerns related to Cr usage. Research on vanadium-based catalysts began in the 1980s, initially focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of vanadium on the catalyst varies based on the carrier type, support surface area, metal loading, and vanadium oxidation state. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are crucial for obtaining a well-dispersed catalyst, serving as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Vanadium species can form as monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites depending on the conditions. Catalysts containing silica dopants in alumina show improved stability and activity. Molybdenum oxide catalysts are also used for hydrocarbon conversion, including dehydrogenation, with similar chemistry to vanadium oxide. Molybdenum oxide catalysts are often reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create active species, typically Mo4+ and Mo5+. Gallium oxide catalysts, especially β-Ga2O3, have been noted for their dehydrogenation activity, though the exact nature of the active sites remains debated. The conversion efficiency of gallium oxide catalysts can vary significantly based on the support used, with high conversion observed when using supports with medium-strength acid sites. A highly active and selective gallium oxide-based catalyst, containing 1.2% Ga2O3, 0.25% K, and 1000 ppm Pt, has been developed, showing high stability and resistance to coking.

由于铂（Pt）中毒、成本高昂和铬使用带来的环境问题，钒氧化物基催化剂被探索作为石蜡脱氢反应中铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂的替代品。20世纪80年代开始研究钒基催化剂，最初关注于使用钒镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。催化剂中钒的存在状态主要取决于载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载以及钒的氧化状态。支持表面的羟基团对于获得分散良好的催化剂至关重要，它们充当用于制备这些催化剂的钒前体的锚定点。根据钼的负载量、所使用的支持物类型以及催化剂制备条件，钼氧化物可以呈现为钼氧化物单体、聚合体或钼酸盐结晶体。在没有氧化剂的情况下，使用二氧化硅掺杂的氧化铝支持的镓氧化物催化剂，在烷烃脱氢反应中的转化效率分别高达高、中、低，而二氧化硅和镁氧化物支持的镓氧化物催化剂则完全无效。当这种催化剂用于PDH时，在580°C下运行150小时后，可以获得39%的转化率和85%的选择性，且在650°C下频繁再生。
