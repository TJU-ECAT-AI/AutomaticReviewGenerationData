(199, 200) The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201) Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant. Therefore, a combination of VO-support, VOV, or VO moieties may be obtained, each having different catalytic activity. In addition, depending on the support, mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or Mg may be formed.
Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings. On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation.
Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, (203-206) the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH. Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation. On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation. (30, 206)
Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. (207-209) The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds.
V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C. (210) In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. (211-213)
Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity. (214) Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation. (208)

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns related to the use of Cr. Research in this area started in the 1980s, focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. The nature of the vanadium species present on the catalyst is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. The behavior of these species varies based on their location relative to monolayer coverage: isolated species are present below monolayer coverage, polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored at intermediate coverage, and V2O5 crystallites dominate at higher loadings. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for dispersion, while acid sites can hinder performance by facilitating cracking and coke formation. Two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are often deemed the most active for dehydrogenation, with vanadium species bonded directly to the support being particularly active. Isolated vanadium species show activity but are prone to deactivation due to coke formation. Large V2O5 crystallites are generally inactive in dehydrogenation. The vanadium in these catalysts typically exists as V5+ before reduction by the hydrocarbon feed, which forms V4+ and V3+. The reducibility of vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Treating catalysts under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C can revert V2O5 crystallites to active polymeric vanadium species. CO2 is sometimes added to the feed as a mild oxidant to enhance alkene yields. Using silica to dope alumina supports provides benefits for catalyst stability and activity, while adding MgO as a promoter or component of a mixed oxide can improve selectivity by reducing coke formation.

探索以氧化钒（VOx）为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品用于烷烃脱氢的原因是催化剂中毒、铂的成本高昂以及使用Cr对环境的影响。自20世纪80年代以来，研究主要集中在使用钒镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。催化剂中钒物种的存在受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载量和钒的氧化状态等因素的影响。这些物种的行为取决于其相对于单层覆盖的程度：在低于单层覆盖的情况下存在孤立物种，在中间覆盖下倾向于形成聚集体或钒氧化物薄片，而在更高负载量下则为主导的是V2O5晶体。支持表面上的羟基团对于分散至关重要，而酸性位点可能阻碍性能，因为它们促进裂解并导致焦炭形成。二维聚集体的V3+ 或V4+ 物种通常被认为是脱氢反应中最活跃的，直接与支持物结合的钒物种特别活跃。孤立的钒物种表现出活性，但容易因焦炭形成而失活。大的V2O5晶体一般在脱氢过程中不活跃。这些催化剂中的钒通常以V5+ 形式存在，然后被烃类气体还原为V4+ 和V3+。不同类型的分子结构决定了钒物种的可还原性，VOV和VO键比VO支持键更容易被还原。在600°C的氧气气氛下处理催化剂可以将V2O5晶体恢复为活性聚集体钒物种。有时向反应流中添加二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂来提高烯烃产率。通过在铝硅基支持物中掺入二氧化硅可以提供催化剂稳定性和活性的益处，而添加氧化镁作为助剂或混合氧化物的成分可以改善选择性，通过减少焦炭形成降低活性。

催化剂上的钒性质很大程度上取决于载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载量以及钒的氧化状态。在理论单层覆盖度以下，存在孤立的钒物种；在中间覆盖度下，倾向于形成聚集体或钒氧化物薄片；超过单层覆盖度后，V2O5晶体占据主导地位。因此，可以得到VO-support、VOV或VO基团的组合，每种组合具有不同的催化活性。根据支持材料的不同，也可能形成含铝（Al）、锆（Zr）、钛（Ti）或镁（Mg）的混合氧化物。

The first report of the dehydrogenation activity of a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst was of MoO3/Al2O3 in the dehydrocyclization of n-heptane, which was published in 1946.
Optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support.
At loadings above monolayer coverage, the catalyst is more easily reduced, which results in a drop in catalyst activity.
The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide.
Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support.

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by issues such as catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns related to the use of Cr. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the synthesis and characterization of vanadium-based catalysts for dehydrogenation. The nature of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the predominant species present on the catalyst. Above a certain loading, V2O5 crystallites dominate, while at lower loadings, polymeric or monomeric vanadium species are more prevalent. Activating agents like CO2 can enhance alkene yields by altering the surface chemistry of the catalyst. Weak basic sites on the support can facilitate beneficial reactions, while strong basic sites can poison the catalyst.

2. Molybdenum oxides are also used as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. The first report of a molybdenum oxide catalyst for dehydrogenation was in 1946. Optimal activity is achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. At higher loadings, the catalyst becomes more easily reduced, leading to a decrease in activity. The addition of promoters like magnesium oxide can improve catalyst performance by reducing coke formation and increasing alkene selectivity. Molybdenum oxycarbides can form during dehydrogenation, leading to a transition in catalyst activity and stability.

3. Gallium oxide-based catalysts have gained renewed interest in recent years for their potential in dehydrogenation reactions. The exact nature of active sites in Ga-based catalysts is under debate, with some suggesting that β-Ga2O3 is the most active species. β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure with weak Lewis acid sites, which are believed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity. The presence of acid sites on the support can influence catalyst performance. The reducibility of Ga2O3 can depend on its interaction with the catalyst support. The addition of CO2 to the feed can improve olefin yields by altering the surface chemistry of the catalyst, though its effect can vary depending on the level of coke deposition. The structure of the support, particularly its porosity, also impacts catalyst performance by influencing coke formation and selectivity.

1. 探索使用二氧化钒作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)的替代品进行烷烃脱氢的原因，主要是由于催化剂中毒、Pt的高昂成本以及Cr使用时的环境问题。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展起来，专注于开发基于二氧化钒的脱氢催化剂。这些催化剂中钒物种的存在受载体类型、支撑表面面积、金属负载和钒的氧化状态的影响。载体面积与金属负载比例决定了催化剂上存在的主要物种。在较高的负载下，V2O5晶粒占主导地位，而在较低的负载下，则是聚集体或单体钒物种更常见。激活剂如二氧化碳可以提高烯烃产率，通过改变催化剂的表面化学性质。支撑上较弱的基本位点可以促进有益反应，而较强的基团则会毒害催化剂。

2. 钼氧化物也常用于烃类转化反应，包括脱氢。最早的钼氧化物催化剂用于脱氢的报告是在1946年。在氧化铝支持下，以单层覆盖度存在的钼氧化物可以获得最佳活性。在较高负载下，催化剂更容易被还原，导致活性下降。添加镁氧化物等促进剂可以改善催化剂性能，通过减少焦炭形成和增加烯烃选择性来增加活性。钼氧化碳在不支持的钼氧化物上形成，导致催化剂活性和稳定性转变。

3. 近年来，镓氧化物基催化剂重新引起了人们的关注，它们可能用于脱氢反应。关于镓基催化剂中活性位点的确切性质存在争议，其中一些人认为β-Ga2O3是最活跃的物种。β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，其中镓原子均匀分布在四面体和八面体配置之间，被认为是脱氢化活性中心。支撑上酸性位点的存在可以影响催化剂性能。镓氧化物的可还原性可能取决于它与催化剂支撑的相互作用。向反应流中添加二氧化碳可以改善烯烃产率，通过改变催化剂的表面化学性质，但其效果会根据焦炭沉积量的不同而变化。支撑的结构，特别是其孔隙性，也会影响催化剂性能，影响焦炭形成和选择性。

对于石蜡脱氢，寻找铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代催化剂的原因是催化剂中毒、Pt的高成本以及Cr使用的环境问题。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已发展，专注于开发用于氧化脱氢的钨基催化剂。在这些催化剂中，钨物种的性质受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载和钨氧化状态的影响。根据支持，铝（Al）、锆（Zr）、钛（Ti）或镁（Mg）可以形成混合氧化物。表面面积与金属负载比决定了存在的钨物种类型。支持表面的羟基团对分散催化剂至关重要，作为钨前体的锚定位点。然而，酸性位点会负面影响催化剂性能，通过促进裂解和焦炭形成。二维聚集体钨物种（V3+或V4+）通常被认为是脱氢最活跃的物种。在反应之前，钨通常以V5+的形式存在，但通过碳氢化合物流体的还原转化为V4+和V3+。在更高负载下，V2O5晶体会在600°C的氧气气氛处理下重新转变为活性聚集体钨物种。有时会在流体中添加二氧化碳（CO2）作为轻烯烃生成的温和氧化剂。氧化铝是一种常见的支持材料，但是添加硅可以提供稳定性与活性方面的益处。镁氧化物（MgO）可以作为促进剂或混合氧化物的成分添加，通过其碱性性质降低焦炭形成，从而提高脱氢选择性。
