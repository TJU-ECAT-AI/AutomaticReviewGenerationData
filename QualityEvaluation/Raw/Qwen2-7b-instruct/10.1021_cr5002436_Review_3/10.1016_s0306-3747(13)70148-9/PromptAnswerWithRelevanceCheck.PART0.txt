1. The global market for calcium carbonate is closely tied to the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy, particularly in the paper, automotive, plastics, and construction industries. Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market. Asia Pacific presents significant growth opportunities, especially due to China's increasing demand for paints and plastics in the construction industry. The establishment of satellite plants in North America and Europe is expected to benefit the precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) market. 

2. Global demand for carbon black is projected to experience dynamic growth until 2019. This growth is primarily driven by the automotive industry, which is a key sales market for carbon black. Asia Pacific leads the market growth, with consumption and production volumes in the region expected to increase by over 4.5% annually. China is a dominant player in the carbon black market, accounting for over 30% of the global volume. The rise in capacity expansions in Asia Pacific is anticipated to make the region a net exporter of carbon black in the future.

3. The ASTM International standard ASTM D7823 provides a method for identifying and qualifying low-level, regulated phthalates in poly(vinyl chloride) plastics. This standard is utilized by analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). Products subject to this regulation include children's toys and childcare articles that can be placed in the mouth. The standard covers six specific phthalates, including di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which are used as plasticizers in various polymers.
