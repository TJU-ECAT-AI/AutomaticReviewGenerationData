1. Calcium carbonate is widely utilized as a filler in various industries including plastics, paper, rubber, coatings, light chemicals, and architectural materials. Its market dynamics are closely tied to the trends in the paper, automotive, plastics, and construction industries, which are influenced by the global economy's cyclical fluctuations. Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market, particularly in Asia Pacific where China plays a significant role in driving growth. 

2. The automotive industry is the primary market for carbon black, as its performance is crucial for both the tyre segment and the usage in a broad range of rubber products. The global production of passenger cars and utility vehicles has seen substantial growth, contributing to the demand for carbon black.

3. Phthalates, used as plasticizers for polymers such as rubber and nitrocellulose, are subject to regulations aimed at ensuring safety and compliance with environmental standards.

4. The ASTM International standard ASTM D7823 provides a method for identifying and qualifying low-level regulated phthalates in poly (vinyl chloride) plastics through thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass chromatography. This standard is utilized by analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers to ensure compliance with laws such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), European Union Directive 2005/84/EC, and Japan's Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry Guideline No. 336 (2010).

1. 碳酸钙广泛应用于塑料、纸张、橡胶、涂层、轻化工产品和建筑材料等领域作为填充剂。其市场动态与造纸、汽车、塑料和建筑行业的发展趋势紧密相关，这些行业受全球经济周期性波动的影响显著。磨碎碳酸钙（GCC）是全球最大的且增长最快的市场细分领域，尤其是在亚洲太平洋地区，中国对增长贡献巨大。

2. 汽车行业是碳黑的主要市场，因为其性能对于轮胎领域以及各种橡胶产品的使用至关重要。全球乘用车和多功能车产量的大幅增长推动了碳黑的需求。

3. 邻苯二甲酸盐被用作多种聚合物（如橡胶和硝化纤维素）的增塑剂，并受到旨在确保安全并符合环境标准的法规管制。

4. ASTM国际标准ASTM D7823提供了一种方法，用于通过热解吸气相色谱/质谱法识别聚氯乙烯塑料中低水平受管制的邻苯二甲酸盐。此标准由分析实验室、监管机构和制造商使用，以确保符合2008年消费者产品安全改进法案（CPSIA）法律、欧盟2005/84/EC指令以及日本劳动和福利部第336号指南（2010年）等规定。
