1. Calcium carbonate is widely utilized as a filler in various industries including plastics, paper, rubber, coatings, light chemicals, and architectural materials. Its consumption decreased during the economic downturns of recession years. Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is the leading and fastest-growing product segment in the global market. Asia Pacific presents significant growth potential, particularly due to China's increasing domestic demand for paints and plastics in the construction industry.

2. Global demand for carbon black is anticipated to experience dynamic growth until 2019, as per a market study by Ceresana Research. This growth is mainly driven by the automotive industry, which is the largest market for carbon black. Moreover, the study offers in-depth analysis of the carbon black market across regions, countries, and application areas, along with projections to 2019. The report also includes comprehensive profiles of the 52 largest manufacturers in the sector.

3. A new ASTM International standard, under the authority of Committee D20 on Plastics, introduces a method for identifying and qualifying specific phthalates in polyvinyl chloride plastics. This standard will be utilized by analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers to ascertain if a product complies with Section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008. The six phthalates covered by the standard are: dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-dioctyl phthalate (DNOP), di-(C8-10 branched alkyl) phthalate (DINP), and di-(C9-11 branched alkyl) phthalate (DIDP).

1. 碳酸钙广泛应用于塑料、纸张、橡胶、涂层、轻化工和建筑材料等领域作为填充剂。在经济衰退期间，其消费量因此下降。粉状碳酸钙（GCC）是全球市场中最大的和增长最快的细分产品段。亚太地区为增长提供了巨大机会，尤其是由于中国对建筑行业中的涂料和塑料的国内需求激增。

2. 根据Ceresana研究的新市场研究报告，全球碳黑需求预计将在2019年前呈现动态增长。这一增长主要由汽车行业驱动，这是碳黑的最大销售市场。此外，报告还提供了根据区域、国家和地区以及应用领域的碳黑市场深度分析，包括至2019年的预测。报告还包含52家最大制造商的详细概况。

3. ASTM国际在委员会D20下发布了一个新的标准，该标准为在聚氯乙烯塑料中识别和验证特定邻苯二甲酸盐提供了一种方法。此标准将被分析实验室、监管机构和制造商用于确定产品是否符合2008年消费者产品安全改进法案第108条的要求。所覆盖的六种邻苯二甲酸盐包括：丁基邻苯二甲酸盐（DBP）、苯基乙基邻苯二甲酸盐（BBP）、双（2-乙基己基）邻苯二甲酸盐（DEHP）、n-癸基癸基邻苯二甲酸盐（DNOP）、（C8-10支链烷基）邻苯二甲酸盐（DINP）和（C9-11支链烷基）邻苯二甲酸盐（DIDP）。
