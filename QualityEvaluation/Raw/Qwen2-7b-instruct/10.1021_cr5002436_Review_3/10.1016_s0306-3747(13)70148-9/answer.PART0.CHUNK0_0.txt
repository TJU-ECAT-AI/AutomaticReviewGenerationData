1. The global market for calcium carbonate is closely tied to the cyclical fluctuations of the global economy, particularly in the paper, automotive, plastics, and construction industries. Ground calcium carbonate (GCC) is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the global market. Asia Pacific presents significant growth opportunities, especially due to China's increasing demand for paints and plastics in the construction industry. The establishment of satellite plants in North America and Europe is expected to benefit the precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) market. 

2. Global demand for carbon black is projected to experience dynamic growth until 2019. This growth is primarily driven by the automotive industry, which is a key sales market for carbon black. Asia Pacific leads the market growth, with consumption and production volumes in the region expected to increase by over 4.5% annually. China is a dominant player in the carbon black market, accounting for over 30% of the global volume. The rise in capacity expansions in Asia Pacific is anticipated to make the region a net exporter of carbon black in the future.

3. The ASTM International standard ASTM D7823 provides a method for identifying and qualifying low-level, regulated phthalates in poly(vinyl chloride) plastics. This standard is utilized by analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). Products subject to this regulation include children's toys and childcare articles that can be placed in the mouth. The standard covers six specific phthalates, including di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which are used as plasticizers in various polymers.

1. 全球碳酸钙市场的动态与全球经济周期性波动密切相关，特别是在造纸、汽车、塑料和建筑行业。在所有产品类别中，超细微碳酸钙（GCC）是增长最快的细分市场。亚太地区为增长提供了巨大机遇，尤其是中国对建筑行业涂料和塑料的旺盛国内需求。北美和欧洲地区卫星工厂的建立对PCC市场形成利好。 

2. 预计全球碳黑需求将在2019年前呈现出动态增长态势。汽车行业是碳黑的主要销售市场，其发展对于碳黑市场至关重要。亚太地区是市场增长的主要驱动力，该地区的消费和生产量预计每年将增加超过4.5%。中国在碳黑市场占据主导地位，消耗了全球总量超过30%的碳黑。随着产能的持续扩张，预计亚太地区将成为未来碳黑的净出口地区。

3. ASTM国际标准ASTM D7823提供了一种方法，用于确定聚氯乙烯塑料中的低水平、受管制的邻苯二甲酸盐。这一标准被分析实验室、监管机构和制造商用来确保符合2008年消费者产品安全改进法案第108节的要求。受此法规约束的产品包括可放置于儿童口腔内的玩具和儿童保育用品。该标准涵盖了六种特定的邻苯二甲酸盐，包括二(2-乙基己基)邻苯二甲酸盐（DEHP），这些物质常被用作各种聚合物的增塑剂。
