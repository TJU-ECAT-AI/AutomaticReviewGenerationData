[1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are used in the manufacture of important chemicals (e.g. sulfuric acid, phthalic anhydride) and in the reduction of environmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen oxides from flue gas of power plants) and is the most important metal used in metal oxide catalysis."
[2] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are active in a wide range of applications."
[3] "During the last decade catalyst scientists have unambiguously shown that the activity and selectivity of supported metal oxide catalysts are significantly affected by the properties of the support oxide material."
[4] "This is generally known as the metal oxidesupport effect, although its exact origin and mechanism of operation is still unclear."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their ability to offer competitive performance in chemical synthesis and environmental applications. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements focusing on understanding the complex interactions between vanadium species and the support materials. Factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables can significantly impact the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability during the catalytic process.
