The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with studies focusing on understanding the unique properties and behaviors of vanadium species within these catalysts. Factors such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and performance of vanadium-based catalysts.

The use of vanadium oxide catalysts in various industrial processes, including the manufacture of sulfuric acid, phthalic anhydride, and the reduction of environmental pollutants like nitrogen oxides from power plant flue gases, highlights their versatility and importance in catalysis. These catalysts represent approximately 5% of the annual production of vanadium, demonstrating their significance in industrial applications.

The effectiveness of vanadium oxide catalysts is closely tied to the properties of the support oxide material, indicating that the metal oxide-support effect plays a significant role in their performance. The recent advancements in understanding the surface chemistry and spectroscopy of vanadium oxides have contributed to a deeper insight into the behavior of these catalysts during various stages of their lifecycle, including synthesis, calcination, activation, catalytic operation, and deactivation.

The choice of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading can greatly influence the characteristics of vanadium species within the catalysts. These factors impact the reactivity, stability, and selectivity of the catalysts, making them adaptable to specific industrial needs and environmental conditions.
