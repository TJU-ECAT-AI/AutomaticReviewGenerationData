[1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are used in the manufacture of important chemicals (e.g. sulfuric acid, phthalic anhydride) and in the reduction of environmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen oxides from flue gas of power plants) and is the most important metal used in metal oxide catalysis."
[2] "Most catalysts based on vanadium oxide consist of a vanadium oxide phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support, such as SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2."
[3] "During the last decade catalyst scientists have unambiguously shown that the activity and selectivity of supported metal oxide catalysts are significantly affected by the properties of the support oxide material."
[4] "The fundamental basis for the catalytic performances of supported vanadium oxides lies in the variability in geometric and electronic structure of surface vanadium oxides."
[5] "No exhaustive discussion of all the catalytic applications of supported vanadium oxides available in the open literature will be given (Table 2)."
[6] "Rather, we want to develop fundamental concepts, which explain the differences in chemistry of supported vanadium oxides during each stage of the life-span of a heterogeneous catalyst, i.e. synthesis, calcination, activation, catalytic operation and deactivation."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their ability to efficiently convert hydrocarbons into olefins and aromatics. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the role of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts. These factors affect the structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide surfaces, influencing the overall catalytic performance.

The fundamental basis for the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxides lies in the variability of their geometric and electronic structures, which can change during various stages of the catalyst's life cycle, including synthesis, calcination, activation, catalytic operation, and deactivation. The properties of the support oxide material significantly impact the activity and selectivity of the supported metal oxide catalysts. While an exhaustive discussion of all the catalytic applications of supported vanadium oxides is not provided, the review emphasizes the development of fundamental concepts to explain the differences in the chemistry of supported vanadium oxides throughout their life span.

对于烷烃脱氢，采用钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品，其探索是基于它们高效地将碳氢化合物转化为烯烃和芳香族化合物的能力。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已显著发展，对钒物种在这些催化剂中的性质有了更深入的理解。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对确定钒物种的性质和行为至关重要。这些因素影响了钒氧化物表面的结构和反应性，从而影响整体催化性能。

支持钒氧化物的催化性能的基础在于其表面的几何和电子结构的变化，这些结构在催化剂生命周期的不同阶段（包括合成、煅烧、活化、催化操作和失活）中可以变化。支持氧化物材料的性质显著影响了支持金属氧化物催化剂的活性和选择性。虽然没有详细讨论所有公开文献中支持钒氧化物的所有催化应用，但综述强调了开发解释支持钒氧化物在催化剂生命周期各个阶段化学差异的基本概念的重要性。
