[1] "The most dominant non-metallurgical use of vanadium is in catalysis, which represents about 5% of the annual production of vanadium."
[2] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are used in the manufacture of important chemicals (e.g. sulfuric acid, phthalic anhydride) and in the reduction of environmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen oxides from flue gas of power plants)."
[3] "This is generally known as the metal oxidesupport effect, although its exact origin and mechanism of operation is still unclear."
[4] "The fundamental basis for the catalytic performances of supported vanadium oxides lies in the variability in geometric and electronic structure of surface vanadium oxides."

Research into vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. These catalysts offer benefits such as higher stability and lower cost compared to traditional alternatives. Factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables can significantly affect the catalyst's performance, leading to improved efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.
