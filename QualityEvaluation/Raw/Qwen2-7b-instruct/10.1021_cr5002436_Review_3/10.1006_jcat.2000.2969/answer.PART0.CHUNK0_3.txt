[1] "The vanadium oxide catalyst was tested in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and i-butane at 580C under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "The activity of the catalyst was related to the reduced valence state of vanadium, either V4+ or V3+,or possibly both. These species were formed during reduction of the catalyst with all reducing agents: butane, CO,methane, and H2."
[3] "The activity of the catalyst was highest after reduction with CO."
[4] "The initial conversions of i-butane and n-butane were 64% and 55%, which are 72% and 63%, respectively, of the thermodynamic equilibrium values."
[5] "The activity was lower after reduction with H2, CH4, and butane, possibly due to OH groups formed during these reductions and adsorbed on some of the reduced vanadium centres that are active in dehydrogenation."
[6] "The decrease in activity and the increase in selectivity during the dehydrogenation of butanes were likely due to the formation of coke on the surface."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species in different catalysts. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have been found to significantly influence the activity and selectivity of vanadium oxide catalysts.

2. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide catalysts are influenced by various factors, including the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The carrier type affects the dispersion of vanadium oxide, which in turn impacts the number of active sites available for the dehydrogenation reaction. The support surface area influences the accessibility of reactants and products, affecting the overall efficiency of the catalyst. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium species on the support, which can alter the redox properties and reactivity of the catalyst.
