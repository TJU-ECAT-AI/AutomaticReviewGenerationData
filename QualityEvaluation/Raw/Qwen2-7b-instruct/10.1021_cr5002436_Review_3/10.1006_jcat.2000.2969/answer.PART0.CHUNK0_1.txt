[1] "The activity of an alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580C under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "The activity of the catalyst was therefore studied in detail after reduction with H2, CH4, and CO."
[3] "The activity was highest after CO reduction, even though the average oxidation states after the three reductions were similar."
[4] "It was concluded that the main reason for the lower activity after H2 and CH4 reduction was the formation of OH groups that decreased the number of active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "The primary cause of the catalyst deactivation during dehydrogenation was the formation of coke."

Answer: The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s, initially focusing on their potential as alternatives to precious metals like Pt and CrOx. Research has emphasized the importance of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the behavior and nature of vanadium species within these catalysts. Factors such as carrier type can alter the dispersion of vanadium oxide, impacting its activity and stability. Surface area affects the number of active sites available for the dehydrogenation process. Metal loading, particularly the concentration of vanadium, is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance. The formation of OH groups and coke deposition on the catalyst surface are key reasons for reduced activity, especially after reduction with H2 and CH4. The highest activity is generally achieved after CO reduction, indicating the role of the reduced valence state of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction.

答案：自1980年代以来，对基于氧化钒的催化剂在异丁烷和正丁烷脱氢方面的研究已经取得了显著进展，最初主要将其视为铂和CrOx等贵金属替代品的可能性。研究着重于载体类型、支撑面积和金属负载等因素对这些催化剂中钒物种行为和性质的影响。载体类型可以改变钒氧化物的分散性，从而影响其活性和稳定性。支撑面积影响可用的活性位点数量，用于脱氢过程。金属负载，特别是钒的浓度，对于实现最佳催化性能至关重要。OH基团的形成和催化剂表面焦炭沉积是导致活性降低的主要原因，尤其是在用H2和CH4进行还原后。CO还原后获得的最高活性表明，钒的还原价态在脱氢反应中的作用。
