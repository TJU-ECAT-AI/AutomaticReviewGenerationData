Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts has been evolving since the 1980s as alternatives to precious metals like Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. Factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The formation of OH groups during reductions with H2 and CH4 decreases the number of active sites for dehydrogenation, leading to lower activity. Coke formation on the surface is identified as the primary cause of catalyst deactivation during the dehydrogenation process.

Answer: The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s, initially focusing on their potential as alternatives to precious metals like Pt and CrOx. Research has emphasized the importance of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the behavior and nature of vanadium species within these catalysts. Factors such as carrier type can alter the dispersion of vanadium oxide, impacting its activity and stability. Surface area affects the number of active sites available for the dehydrogenation process. Metal loading, particularly the concentration of vanadium, is critical for achieving optimal catalytic performance. The formation of OH groups and coke deposition on the catalyst surface are key reasons for reduced activity, especially after reduction with H2 and CH4. The highest activity is generally achieved after CO reduction, indicating the role of the reduced valence state of vanadium in the dehydrogenation reaction.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research in this area has focused on understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species, particularly in their reduced states (V4+ or V3+, or possibly both) that catalyze the dehydrogenation of butanes to butenes and hydrogen. Factors influencing the effectiveness of these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. 

The nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts are primarily influenced by their reduced oxidation states. The dehydrogenation activity is closely tied to the presence of these reduced vanadium species, which can vary depending on the reduction agent used. For instance, carbon monoxide (CO) reduction leads to the highest activity, whereas hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) reduction result in lower activity due to the formation of OH groups that decrease the number of active sites for the reaction. 

Additionally, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation during the dehydrogenation process is the formation of coke, which reduces the efficiency of the catalyst. The reduction of vanadium oxide is also influenced by the vanadium content of the catalyst and the type of support used. The reduction behavior is typically characterized by a shift from V5+ to an average oxidation state between V4+ and V3+, depending on the reducing agent (hydrogen, CO, or alkenes).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the reduced catalysts exhibit oxidation states of V5+, V4+, and V3+. The fractions of these oxidation states after reductions with hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide differ slightly. However, after a subsequent dehydrogenation test with i-butane, the activity of the catalyst remains relatively consistent across the different reductions. This suggests that the oxidation states of vanadium are not significantly altered during the reduction processes.

自1980年代以来，对以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究已经取得了显著进展。这一领域的研究主要集中在理解这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质及其在催化丁烷转化为丁烯和氢气过程中的行为。影响这些催化剂有效性的因素包括载体类型、支持面积和金属负载。

这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质主要由其还原氧化状态决定。脱氢活性与这些还原状态的范德华物种紧密相关，这些物种根据使用的还原剂（如氢气、一氧化碳或烯烃）而变化。例如，一氧化碳（CO）还原导致最高活性，而氢气（H2）和甲烷（CH4）还原导致活性降低，这是由于形成OH基团减少了反应活性位点的数量。

此外，催化剂失活的主要原因是表面形成焦炭，这会降低催化剂的效率。范德华氧化物的还原也受到催化剂中范德华含量和所用支持物的影响。通常情况下，还原行为表现为从V5+向平均氧化态介于V4+和V3+之间的转变，具体取决于还原剂（氢气、一氧化碳或烯烃）。

X射线光电子能谱（XPS）显示，还原催化剂的氧化态为V5+、V4+和V3+。在使用氢气、甲烷和一氧化碳进行还原后，这些氧化态的比例略有不同。然而，在随后的使用丁烷进行脱氢测试后，催化剂的活性在不同的还原过程中保持相对一致。这表明在还原过程中，范德华的氧化状态并没有显著改变。
