[1] "The activity of an alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580C under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "The dehydrogenation reaction of the butanes to butenes and hydrogen was found to be catalysed by the reduced state of vanadium oxide (V4+ or V3+, or possibly both)."
[3] "The activity of the catalyst was highest after CO reduction, even though the average oxidation states after the three reductions were similar."
[4] "It was concluded that the main reason for the lower activity after H2 and CH4 reduction was the formation of OH groups that decreased the number of active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "The primary cause of the catalyst deactivation during dehydrogenation was the formation of coke."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts has been evolving since the 1980s as alternatives to precious metals like Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. Factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The formation of OH groups during reductions with H2 and CH4 decreases the number of active sites for dehydrogenation, leading to lower activity. Coke formation on the surface is identified as the primary cause of catalyst deactivation during the dehydrogenation process.

自1980年代以来，对范德华氧化物基催化剂的研究一直在发展，作为铂和CrOx等贵金属的替代品用于烷烃脱氢。影响这些催化剂中范德华物种性质和行为的因素包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载量。在H2和CH4的还原过程中形成OH团簇减少了脱氢反应的活性位点，导致活性降低。表面焦炭的形成被确认为催化剂失活的主要原因。
