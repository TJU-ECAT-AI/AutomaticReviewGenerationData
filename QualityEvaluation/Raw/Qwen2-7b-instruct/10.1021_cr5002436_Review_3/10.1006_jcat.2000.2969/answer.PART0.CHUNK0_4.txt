[1] "The activity of an alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580C under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "The dehydrogenation reaction of the butanes to butenes and hydrogen was found to be catalysed by the reduced state of vanadium oxide (V4+ or V3+, or possibly both)."
[3] "The activity of the catalyst was highest after CO reduction, even though the average oxidation states after the three reductions were similar."
[4] "It was concluded that the main reason for the lower activity after H2 and CH4 reduction was the formation of OH groups that decreased the number of active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "The primary cause of the catalyst deactivation during dehydrogenation was the formation of coke."
[6] "The reduction of vanadium oxide also has been widely studied. After calcination the vanadium oxide is mainly in oxidation state V5+. On an alumina support it can be reduced to an average oxidation state between V4+ and V3+ by hydrogen, CO, and alkenes (1316)."
[7] "The oxidation states found in the reduced catalysts by XPS were V5+, V4+, and V3+."
[8] "Perhaps, then, the differences between the activities in dehydrogenation after CO and H2 reduction are, at least in part, related to differences in the number of active sites."
[9] "The activity was lower after reduction with H2, CH4, and butane, possibly due to OH groups formed during these reductions and adsorbed on some of the reduced vanadium centres that are active in dehydrogenation."
[10] "The low activity obtained after CO reduction and subsequent water treatment supports this suggestion."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species, particularly in their reduced forms (V4+ or V3+) on carriers like alumina, which influence catalytic activity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the activity of vanadium oxide catalysts. The activity is influenced by factors including the presence of OH groups, which decrease active sites, and the formation of coke, which deactivates the catalyst. CO reduction yields the highest activity, possibly due to the stability and dispersion of vanadium species in this state. The presence of OH groups and coke formation during reduction with H2 and CH4 reduces the catalyst's activity. Water treatment after CO reduction decreases the activity further, supporting the role of OH groups in deactivation.

自1980年代以来，对以V为基底的氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品在石蜡脱氢中的应用进行了深入研究。研究重点在于理解不同还原态（V4+或V3+）在载体（如氧化铝）上的性质及其对催化活性的影响。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量在决定钒氧化物催化剂活性方面起着关键作用。活性受到OH基团存在（减少活性位点）和焦炭形成（导致催化剂失活）等因素的影响。CO还原得到的活性最高，可能是因为在这种状态下，钒物种的稳定性和分散性较好。H2和CH4还原导致活性降低，这可能与生成的OH基团有关。水处理后CO还原导致的活性降低进一步证实了OH基团在失活过程中的作用。
