1. Introduction
Ethylene is one of the most important intermediates in the
petrochemical industry. In earlier years, the production of ethylene
has been depending on the pyrolysis of gaseous alkanes and liquid
petroleum products. Recently, the use of natural gas as a raw
material is playing an important role in the production of chemicals.
Natural gas contains ca. 10% ethane which is typically converted into
ethylene by thermal cracking. Unfortunately, this process consumes
a large amount of energy and requires a high reaction temperature.
For the dehydrogenation of ethane with oxygen as the oxidant, the
abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, meanwhile releasing the heat, and
the conversion is enhanced at a relatively lower reaction tempera-
ture. However, because of the exothermic characteristics, it is
necessary to remove heat in this process [1]. The over-oxidation of
ethane to carbon dioxide is also unavoidable.
Carbon dioxide is considered as a mild or an unconventional
oxidant. Recently, catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
and propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been
investigated by several groups, and rather high selectivity to
corresponding oleﬁns was reported. Nakagawa et al. [2] found that
gallium
oxide
was
an
effective
catalyst
for
the
oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon
dioxide. The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the dehy-
drogenation reaction has been observed on Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-
loaded catalysts [2–7]. Although the Ga2O3-based catalysts are
highly active for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, the
stability of these catalysts is poor and their activity for longer
terms is rarely investigated.
ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the
chemical industry. Because of the tri-dimensional micro-pore
structure and large speciﬁc surface area, the ZSM-5 zeolite is
considered to be a good catalyst or support [8,9]. In the last decade,
a lot of work has been done to investigate the aromatization of
ethane and propane on Ga-loaded HZSM-5 catalysts with a low Si/
Al ratio. Many authors agree that the aromatization reaction occurs
via
a
bifunctional
mechanism,
i.e.,
the
Ga
species
act
as
dehydrogenation
agents,
while
Brønsted
acid
sites
catalyze
oligomerization and cyclization [10,11]. More recently, a high
Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalyst has been
developed for the selective conversion of propane to propylene in
the presence of CO2, which exhibits both high activity and
excellent stability with time on stream [12,13].
In the present work, dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence
of carbon dioxide over the gallium oxide catalysts supported on
HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios was investigated and compared
with that over b-Ga2O3. The relationship between the surface
acidity and catalytic behavior of the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts is
also discussed.

Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide was investigated over various
gallium-based catalysts. Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts show better stability than b-Ga2O3, and the higher Si/
Al ratio HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation. The Ga2O3/HZSM-
5(97) catalyst exhibits both high activity and stability for dehydrogenation of ethane, with an ethane
conversion of 15% and ethylene selectivity of 94% without any observable trend of deactivation in 70 h.
The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine revealed that the enhancement of the
catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio of the support is caused by the decrease of the acidity of
the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization. The
promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is attributed to the reverse water gas shift
reaction. The catalyst stability is also enhanced by the introduction of CO2.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios (15–170) as well as
silicalite-1
were
prepared
following
the
procedures
in
the
literature [14]. Typically, an aqueous solution of H2SO4 was slowly
dripped into a solution which contains 34.0 g Na2SiO39H2O,
calculated amount of NaAlO2 and 3.2 g tetrapropylammonium
bromide under stirring. The pH value is near 8.0. After the mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 5 h, the mixture gel was
transferred into an autoclave and crystallized at 180 8C for 2 days.
The samples obtained were then calcined at 550 8C for 6 h in air to
remove the template. The parent ZSM-5 zeolites were turned into
the H-form by three consecutive ion exchanges with 0.2 M NH4NO3
solution at 50 8C for a total of 15 h and subsequent calcination in air
at 550 8C for 6 h.
The supported gallium oxide catalysts containing 5 wt% Ga
were prepared by impregnating an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3
on HZSM-5 or silicalite-1 using an incipient wetness method. The
impregnated samples were dried at 100 8C for 12 h and calcined at
650 8C for 6 h in air. The catalysts thus prepared are denoted as
Ga2O3/HSZM-5(x) and Ga2O3/silicalite-1, respectively, where x
indicates the molar ratio of Si/Al. For comparison, b-Ga2O3 was
obtained by calcining Ga(NO3)3xH2O at 650 8C for 6 h in air.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The bulk Si/Al ratios of the prepared HZSM-5 zeolites were
measured by X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrum (XRF) on a Bruker-AXS
S4 Explorer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts was
carried out on a Bruker D8-Advanced X-ray diffractometer using
nickel-ﬁltered Cu-Ka radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The speciﬁc
surface areas
of
the catalysts were
measured by
nitrogen
adsorption
at
196 8C
using
a
Micromeritics
TriStar
3000
instrument and calculated by the BET method. 27Al MAS NMR
measurements were performed on a Bruker DSX 300 spectrometer
at a resonance frequency of 78.2 MHz. Spectra were recorded at a
spinning rate of 12 kHz, a pulse length of 0.31 ms (108) and a delay
time of 0.2 s. All the samples were fully hydrated in a desiccator
over a saturated NaCl solution for 4 days prior to the measure-
ments.
Surface
acidity
was
measured
by
temperature-pro-
grammed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) in a continuous
ﬂow ﬁxed-bed reactor at ambient pressure. A 100-mg sample was
preheated at 550 8C for 2 h, and then cooled to 120 8C in ﬂowing
helium. At this temperature, sufﬁcient pulses of ammonia were
injected until adsorption saturation occurred, followed by purging
with helium for 2 h. The temperature was then raised from 120 to
600 8C at a rate of 10 8C/min, and the ammonia desorbed was
collected in a liquid nitrogen trap and detected by on-line gas
chromatography. In order to characterize the nature of the acid
sites, we recorded the FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on the
catalysts on a Nicolet Nexus 470 FT-IR spectrometer furnished
with an in situ sample cell. A self-supporting disk of the sample (ca.
15 mg) was preheated at 300 8C for 4 h under a vacuum of
1  102 Pa and then cooled to room temperature. FT-IR spectra
were recorded after pyridine adsorption at room temperature for
30 min and evacuation at a desired temperature (100–300 8C) for
30 min. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a
PerkinElmer TGA 7 to determine the amount of coke deposited on
the catalysts after reaction.
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
Catalytic tests were performed at atmospheric pressure on the
Automated Multi-Tube Reaction System, which has 8 ﬁxed-bed
ﬂow quartz microreactors (i.d. = 5 mm). Two hundred milligram of
catalyst was loaded and then preheated at the reaction tempera-
ture (650 8C) for 4 h in argon ﬂow. For the dehydrogenation of
ethane in the presence of CO2, the gas reactant contained 3 vol%
ethane, 15 vol% carbon dioxide, and the balance argon, unless
otherwise stated. The total ﬂow rate of the gas reactant is 30 ml/
min. The hydrocarbon reaction products were analyzed using an
on-line gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a FID and a 10-m
packed column of CP-poraplot Q. The gas products, including CO
and CO2, were analyzed on-line by another GC equipped with a
TCD and a TDX-01 column. The reverse water-gas shift reaction on
Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst was run in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow microreactor at
atmospheric pressure, and the catalyst load was 200 mg. For the
reaction, the H2/CO2/Ar molar ratio is 1/1/1, and the total ﬂow rate
of the gas reactant is 30 ml/min. The reaction temperature is in the
range of 500–650 8C. The amounts of CO2 before and after the
reaction were analyzed on-line by a GC equipped with a TCD and a
TDX-01 column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization
The HZSM-5 supports with different Si/Al ratios as well as
silicalite-1 were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Their
XRD patterns after supporting gallium oxide were measured and
are shown in Fig. 1. No peaks corresponding to gallium oxide are
observed, indicating that gallium oxide is well dispersed on all the
supports. The peak intensities of the samples are almost the same,
showing that all the obtained HZSM-5 and silicalite-1 samples
have the similar crystallinity.
As presented in Table 1, the bulk Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5
supports measured by XRF is close to that of the initial gel. The
composition and textural properties of the supported gallium
oxide samples are also summarized in Table 1. The BET speciﬁc
surface areas of the HZSM-5 supported samples are in the range of
344–379 m2/g; such values are much larger than that of b-Ga2O3.

27Al MAS NMR spectra of the HZSM-5
supported gallium oxide samples. An intense line at 55 ppm from

are observed [15]. The relative intensity of the extra-framework 6-
coordinate aluminum in all the samples is much smaller than that
of 4-coordinate aluminum, indicating that the majority of the Al
species have been incorporated into the framework of the zeolite.
3.2. Acidity measurements
The surface acidity values of HZSM-5 and silicalite-1 supported
gallium oxide catalysts were measured by the NH3-TPD method.
The results are summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 2, together with
those of b-Ga2O3 and HZSM-5(15) for comparison. There is a broad
asymmetric NH3 desorption peak in the TPD proﬁle of b-Ga2O3.
The peak temperature is centered at ca. 360 8C. The acidity of the
catalyst was signiﬁcantly enhanced by the introduction of HZSM-
5(15) as a support; this rise could be attributed to the strong
interaction between gallium oxide and the support [16]. Two
evident desorption peaks at about 250 and 450 8C are observed on
the TPD proﬁle of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(15) catalyst, corresponding to
the weak and strong acid sites of the sample, respectively.
Meanwhile, the total amounts of surface acid sites as well as those
of medium to strong acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3
desorbed within the temperature zone of 350–600 8C) are also
increased after supporting gallium oxide on HZSM-5(15). The
acidity of the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalyst decreases
with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the support. Both the total amount
of acid sites and that of medium to strong acid sites decrease
sharply. The above decrease in the amount of acid sites can be
attributed to the change of the interaction between gallium oxide
and the HZSM-5 support, which was proved by XPS results in our
previous work [12].
The nature of the acid sites on HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide
catalysts was investigated by FT-IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine.
As shown in Fig. 4, both Brønsted (1540 cm1) and Lewis
(1450 cm1) acid sites are observed on these catalysts. Brønsted
and Lewis acidities have been quantiﬁed into the integrated areas
of the peaks at 1540 and 1450 cm1, respectively, and the result is
given in Fig. 5. It can also be seen that pyridine adsorbed on Lewis
acid sites is much more easily desorbed than that adsorbed on

Brønsted acid sites, indicating that most Lewis acid sites are of
weak strength, while most Brønsted acid sites are of medium to
strong strength. Lewis acidity of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(15) is larger than
that of the HZSM-5(15) support, indicating that most of Lewis acid
sites are supplied by gallium oxide. When the Si/Al ratio of the
HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Brønsted and
Lewis acid sites decrease, which is in agreement with the NH3-TPD
results.
3.3. Catalytic activity
Dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 was
carried out at 650 8C over various HZSM-5 supported gallium
oxide catalysts, together with the silicalite-1 supported one. The
variation of ethane conversion versus time on stream for these
catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 6. The initial ethane conversion
decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, showing that the acidities
of the supported gallium oxide catalysts have a great effect on
their dehydrogenation activity. Ga2O3/HZSM-5(15), which is the
most acidic one according to the NH3-TPD results, has the
highest initial activity. However, the selectivity to ethylene over
this catalyst is the lowest. As listed in Table 3, 40.9% of methane
and 15.3% of aromatics are formed due to the side reaction such
as cracking, cyclization and oligomerization [17]. The side
reactions can be suppressed by decreasing the acidities of the
catalysts, so the initial selectivity to ethylene increases as the Si/
Al ratio increases. Thus, the initial ethylene yield has the
sequence of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(53) > Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) > Ga2O3/
HZSM-5(25) > Ga2O3/HZSM-5(15) > Ga2O3/HZSM-
5(170) > Ga2O3/silicalite-1 (Table 3).
For all the catalysts, the ethane conversion drops with reaction
time and almost reaches steady state in 10 h. The decreasing rate of
the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with Si/Al
ratio higher than 90, suggesting that the higher Si/Al ratio HZSM-5
supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactiva-
tion. The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/
Al ratio can also be veriﬁed by the coke deposited on the catalysts
after on stream for 10 h (Table 3). The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst
has the highest steady ethane conversion and the highest steady
ethylene yield.

The above results are quite similar to those of propane
dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts [12,13], since
the dehydrogenation of both ethane and propane over gallium
oxide or supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of
CO2
has
been
thought
to
proceed
through
a
heterolytic
dissociation reaction pathway [18,19]. The similarity indicates
that the high dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is
probably associated with an abundance of surface medium to
strong acid sites as well as with the conjugated effect of proton
and gallium oxide. However, it has been reported that the
reactivity of ethane on the HZSM-5 surface is only 1/25 of that of
propane [20]. So the ethane conversion on Ga2O3/HZSM-5
catalysts is not so high as the propane conversion under the
same reaction condition. Meanwhile, the major side reactions
during the dehydrogenation, such as oligomerization, cycliza-
tion and cracking, would also occur on the acid sites [18].
Therefore, the selectivity and the stability would be reduced by
increasing the acidity of the catalysts. The amount of strong acid
sites presented on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal
result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)
in our study.
Dehydrogenation of ethane was also run over b-Ga2O3 under
the same reaction conditions as comparison, and the result is
shown in Fig. 7. b-Ga2O3 exhibits relatively higher initial activity
than Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst and the conversion of ethane
reaches 57.3%, while the ethylene selectivity is 47.8%. However, the
stability of b-Ga2O3 is rather poor and the activity drops
dramatically to one-tenth within 5 h. Although the amount of
coke deposited on b-Ga2O3 is almost equal to that on the Ga2O3/
HZSM-5(97) catalyst (1.6 and 1.8 wt%, respectively), the speciﬁc
surface area of b-Ga2O3 (28.6 m2/g) is only about one-tenth of that
of
the
Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)
catalyst
(373 m2/g).
So
the
fast
deactivation of b-Ga2O3 can be attributed to the blocking of
active sites by deposited coke.
One of the main problems when using Ga2O3-based catalysts
in the dehydrogenation of ethane is their deactivation with time
on stream [4]. To examine the likely long-term behavior of the
HZSM-5
supported
gallium
oxide
catalysts
under
reaction
conditions,
we
carried
out
an
extended
70-h
on-stream
operation for dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of
CO2 on these catalysts. As shown in Fig. 8, the activities of
Ga2O3/HZSM-5(15) and Ga2O3/HZSM-5(53) drop with reaction
time. Compared with these catalysts, Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) is more
stable after the initial period, and the ethylene yield over
this catalyst maintains about 14% without any observable trend
of deactivation. The selectivity to the aromatics over Ga2O3/
HZSM-5(97) is below 1%. The Ga2O3/HZSM-5 (170) catalyst is
also very stable for this reaction, although the ethylene yield is
very low.
3.4. Effect of CO2 partial pressure
The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of
ethane over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) catalyst was also investigated, and
the results are shown in Fig. 9. The initial activity of the catalyst
was greatly enhanced by introducing CO2. The initial ethane
conversion increases quickly from 17.4% with raising the CO2/C2H6
ratio until it reaches its peak at 23.7% when the CO2/C2H6 ratio
equals 5, and then it decreases with further increase in the CO2/
C2H6 ratio.
The promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction can be
attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction, which accelerates
the formation of the dehydrogenation products by transforming H2
with CO2 into CO and H2O [6]. This can be proved by the result of
H2/CO2 reaction in the present work (Fig. 10). The Ga2O3/HZSM-
5(97) catalyst is active for the reverse water gas shift reaction.
Meanwhile, CO2 has a negative effect on the reaction by
displacement of the ethane adsorbed on the catalyst surface.
Ethane is thought to be adsorbed dissociatively on gallium oxide,
so basic sites are needed for the adsorption of C2H5
+ as well as the
acidic sites for the adsorption of H. Since CO2 is much more acidic
than ethane, the adsorption of CO2 on the basic sites would
certainly reduce the possibility of the adsorption of ethane on
gallium oxide, leading to a reduction in ethane conversion. Similar
results were observed in the propane dehydrogenation over
titanium oxide supported gallium oxide catalysts [6]. The negative
effect of CO2 displacement on the reaction is not evident at a low
concentration of CO2, and the initial ethane conversion increases
with increasing the CO2/C2H6 ratio. When the CO2 concentration

increases, this negative effect becomes dominant, and the ethane
conversion begins to decrease. This accounts for the variation of
the initial ethane conversion with CO2/C2H6 ratio.
It can also be seen that the stability of the catalysts was greatly
improved after the addition of CO2. The Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97)
catalyst was deactivated rapidly within only 1 h in the absence
of CO2, but when 3% of CO2 was introduced, only about 20% of the
initial activity was lost over the same catalyst within 10 h. The
stability was improved with further increasing in the CO2 partial
pressure. The Boudouard reaction (i.e. C + CO2 ! 2CO), which
removes the carbon deposit from the catalyst surface and improves
the stability of the catalyst, was observed over Ga2O3-loaded
catalysts by Nakagawa et al. [4]. On the other hand, these authors
also reported that the use of CO2 in the dehydrogenation assisted in
the rapid desorption of the product (ethylene) from the catalyst
surface, thus leading to the inhibition of coke formation. Therefore,
the improvement of stability can be attributed to the suppression
of coke formation coming from two aspects: elimination of coke by
the Boudouard reaction and promotion of desorption of ethylene
from the catalyst surface. The coke deposition after on stream for
10 h under different CO2 partial pressures was measured by TG and
is listed in Table 4. It can be seen that the amount of coke reduces as
expected when the CO2/C2H6 ratio increases. For the reaction in the
absence of CO2, the amount of coke deposition is low, which may
be due to the low activity of the catalyst.
4. Conclusions
Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2
was investigated over gallium oxide catalysts supported on HZSM-
5 with different Si/Al ratios. A highly active and stable catalyst
Ga2O3/HZSM-5(97) is obtained, with an ethane conversion of 15%
and ethylene selectivity of 94% without any observable trend of
deactivation in 70 h, which is much better than the b-Ga2O3
catalyst. As the Si/Al ratio increases, the initial activity of HZSM-5
supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreases. The catalytic stability is
superior for the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts with Si/Al ratio higher
than 90. The enhancement of the catalyst stability with increasing
the Si/Al ratio of the support is caused by the decrease of the acidity
of the catalysts, which is revealed by NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of
adsorbed pyridine. Results of the dehydrogenation reaction with
different partial pressures of CO2 indicate that there are two roles
of CO2 existing in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by
removing absorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse
water gas shift reaction, and a negative role by displacing ethane
adsorbed on the basic sites of catalyst. The stability is also
improved greatly by the addition of CO2 due to the suppression of
coke formation.
