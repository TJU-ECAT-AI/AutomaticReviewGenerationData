Abstract
The preparation of hexagonal Mo2C of high specific surface areas from 50 to 100 m2 g-1 and CO uptake number density of 5.0·1014 cm-2 is accomplished by temp.-programmed reaction of MoO3 of low specific surface area in a flowing CH4/H2 mixture.
ChemInform Abstract
The preparation of hexagonal Mo2C of high specific surface areas from 50 to 100 m2 g-1 and CO uptake number density of 5.0·1014 cm-2 is accomplished by temp.-programmed reaction of MoO3 of low specific surface area in a flowing CH4/H2 mixture. Depending on the preparation conditions the material obtained is free of surface contamination by noncarbidic carbon layers. In the latter case an active carbide surface can be created by cleaning the contaminated surface by H2 treatment.
