Introduction 
Patent 
data [ 1 - 31 and literature 
reports 
[4 - 71 have shown that 
pentasil-type zeolites are attractive acid catalysts for the conversion of light 
alkanes into aromatics. More recently, interest in the dehydrocyclization 
of 
propane over H-ZSM-5-supported 
metals, as well over metal silicates, has 
been intensified to ascertain the importance 
of the added metal on the 
overall reaction. 
It was conclusively shown that metal-H-ZSM-5 
catalysts 
have higher activity and better selectivity towards conversion of propane 
into aromatics compared with H-ZSM-5. While it was clearly established that 
the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] 
was to enhance the production of 
propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary inter- 
mediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics 
from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory 
inter- 
preted. Furthermore, 
most of the work reported so far has been carried out 
on gallium-exchanged H-ZSM-5 or on gallosilicates, so that the experimental 
observations refer to the combined effects of gallium and zeolite phases. 
However, some recent results [lo] 
have shown that pure Ga20s, under the 
conditions of the dehydrocyclization 
reaction, was active in the dehydro- 
genation of propane into propene as well in the conversion of methylcyclo- 
hexane 
into toluene. The objective 
of the present work was to further 
elucidate the role of gallium oxide in the dehydrocyclization 
reactions. In 
particular, studies of the dehydrogenation-dehydrocyclization 
of n-hexene, 
hexadiene 
and cyclohexane 
were made in an attempt to assess the im- 
portance of the dehydrogenation 
properties‘of 
GazOB in the overall reaction 
mechanism 
involved during the dehydrocyclization 
of light alkanes by 
Ga-HZSM-5 catalysts. 
Experimental 
Gallium oxide preparation 
Ga,03 was prepared by precipitation of Ga(NO& 
with ammonia. 
The 
solid was filtered, thoroughly washed with distilled water, dried at 373 K and

finally calcined at 773 K in flowing oxygen. The surface area determined by 
the BET method was 20 m* g-‘. 
Test reactions 
Catalytic conversions were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a 
continuous-flow fixed bed microreactor. 0.15 g of Ga,Oa was used for each 
catalytic run. The catalyst bed was heated to 773 K with an oxygen stream 
to remove contamination. The reaction was studied at 773 K at a total flow 
rate of 0.5 1 
h-‘. Hydrocarbon partial pressures were, respectively, 760 torr 
&Ha, 
70 torr propene, 53 torr n-hexene, 50 torr 1,5-hexadiene, 47 torr 
cyclohexane. 
Both feed and products were analyzed on an IGC 120 FB 
Intersmat gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and 
a Shimadzu C-R 3A data processor. 
Results 
Table 1 reports the results obtained for the conversion of the hydro- 
carbons, listed above, over Ga203. Conversion, rate and product selectivity 
are given in this table. On Ga20s, the major reaction of propane was the 
dehydrogenation 
into propene. The rate of formation 
of propene was 
relatively low, the propane conversion never exceeding a few percent. Thus 
the net production of propene was small, the composition mixture never 
approaching the propane-propene 
thermodynamic equilibrium.

When propene was passed over GazOs at 773 K, no reaction occurred, 
in agreement with an earlier report [lo]. 
It can be concluded that Ga*Os is 
not active in the polymerization of olefins. 
In contrast, n-hexene was.found to react readily over Ga,O, at 773 K. 
The major conversion products were cycloolefins and aromatics, benzene 
being produced predominantly. Minor products were comprised of Cs, C4 
and C5 olefins and light alkanes. 
Similarly, 1,5-hexadiene was found very reactive at 773 K over GazOs. 
The disappearance of 1,5-hexadiene produced predominantly benzene and 
cyclohexadiene. 
Small amounts of Cs - C5 olefins were also in the product 
mixture. 
Cyclohexane was dehydrogenated at 773 K over GazOs at a relatively 
low rate, the only two products detected being cyclohexene and benzene. 
Discussion 
Although the kinetic equation for the various reactions has not been 
established in this work a first-order rate law is generally observed with 
respect to the hydrocarbon partial pressure. With this assumption, the data 
in Table 1 indicate that over GazOs, with identical experimental conditions, 
the rates of l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene conversion are comparable and 
nearly 20 times as fast as propane or cyclohexane dehydrogenation. 
As stated above, the major product from l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene 
conversion was benzene, which accounted for over 65% of the hydrocarbons 
generated over Ga*Os, cyclohexadiene plus cyclohexene accounting for 20%. 
These observations reveal that Ga,Os catalyzes cyclization of C6 unsaturated 
hydrocarbons. Furthermore, it is worth noting that only a limited amount 
of cracked products were formed. This finding implies that GazOs does not 
promote 
carbon-carbon 
bond cleavage. One could conclude that GazOs 
exhibits almost non-acidic properties. This conclusion is further reinforced 
by the quasi-absence of alkanes in the l-hexene or 1,5-hexadiene conversion 
products, which indicates that Ga,O, is unable to promote hydrogen-transfer 
reactions between olefins and cycloparaffins, a reaction catalyzed by solid 
acids. 
The reaction paths for the dehydrocyclization 
of l-hexene and 1,5- 
hexadiene can be deduced by comparing the measured product distributions 
listed in Table 1. The facts that from the conversion of l-hexene cyclo- 
hexane could not be detected, and that from the conversion of 1,5-hexadiene 
cyclohexene 
was not formed (selectivity to cyclohexene = 1%) allow the 
conclusion that formation of cycloparaffins by direct ring closure of the 
olefins on GazOs can be excluded. It follows that the dehydrocyclization of 
1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene 
probably takes place via the intermediate 
formation of dienes and trienes, the hydrocarbon chain being closed only 
after at least the diolefins were formed. This means that cyclohexane cannot 
be an intermediate in the dehydrocyclization 
of 1-hexene over GazOs. It 
is concluded from this study that with l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene, and 
probably with other paraffins, aromatic hydrocarbons are formed via de- 
LlO 
hydrogenation 
of the paraffin to generate dienes and trienes, hexatrienes 
being readily cyclized into cyclohexadienes 
even in the absence of catalyst. 
Identical reaction paths for the dehydrocyclization 
of paraffins over oxide 
catalysts, 
such as chromium oxide, have already been well documented 
[ 111. It was concluded that n-paraffins are successively dehydrogenated into 
mono-, di- and tri-olefins, the most favorable ring closure path occurring at 
the triene stage. 
The work presented above leads us to conclude that GaZOs functions 
primarily as a dehydrogenation 
catalyst to form di- and triolefins from 
olefins, the trienes being rapidly cyclized in a non-catalytic gas phase reac- 
tion [12]. The remarkable increase in the yield of aromatics from catalytic 
conversion of propane when H-ZSM-5 was promoted with gallium is thus 
reasonably 
understood 
as the result of the dehydrogenating properties of 
gallium oxide, which easily generate trienes from alkenes. The rapid thermal 
cyclization of trienes also implies that there is no need to develop specific 
cyclization properties for gallium oxide.
