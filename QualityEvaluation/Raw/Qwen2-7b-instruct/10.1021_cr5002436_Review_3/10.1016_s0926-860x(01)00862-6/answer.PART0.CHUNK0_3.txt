[1] "We note 1. Conversions greater than ca. 5% require temperatures of 550 C and above."
[2] "Both the oxidative and non-oxidative propane conversions over the catalysts are greater than the homogeneous conversion. The materials are therefore, acting as catalysts."
[3] "Comparing the catalytic behaviour of the molybdenum containing catalysts with the commercial hydrotalcite (Rc), we see that molybdenum enhances activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation and selectivity, but hardly activity, in non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Thus, molybdenum has a specific catalytic role especially in oxidative dehydrogenation."
[4] "We compare our results with literature data for both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in Fig. 4 by plotting propene yield (Y, Section 2.4.1) versus conversion at 500600 C for the catalysts indicated."
[5] "We regard the intercalated hydrotalcite as the precursor of the active catalyst, a well-dispersed magnesium polymolybdate."

1. The document highlights that conversions exceeding 5% necessitate temperatures of 550°C and higher.
2. The catalysts' ability to convert propane surpasses that of a homogeneous reaction, indicating their catalytic action.
3. Molybdenum boosts activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly over the commercial hydrotalcite, whereas its impact on non-oxidative dehydrogenation is minimal.
4. The document contrasts its findings with those in the literature on both oxidative and non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation by plotting propene yield against conversion at temperatures ranging from 500 to 600°C.
5. The intercalated hydrotalcite is viewed as the precursor to the active catalyst, a well-dispersed magnesium polymolybdate.

1. 文档指出，超过5%的转化需要550°C及以上的温度。
2. 催化剂对丙烷的转化率超过了均相反应，表明它们具有催化作用。
3. 在氧化脱氢过程中，钼可以增强活性和选择性，特别是在与商业水合物相比时，而在非氧化脱氢过程中其影响很小。
4. 文档通过在500到600°C的温度范围内绘制丙烯产率与转化率的关系图，将其结果与文献中关于氧化和非氧化丙烷脱氢的研究进行了对比。
5. 认为插层水合物是活性催化剂的前身，一种分散良好的镁多钼酸盐。
