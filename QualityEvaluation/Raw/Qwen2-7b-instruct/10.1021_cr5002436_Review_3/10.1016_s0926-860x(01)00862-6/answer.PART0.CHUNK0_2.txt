[1] "The preparation of catalysts having molybdate intercalated into a hydrotalcite derived from magnesium aluminium hydroxy carbonate, [Mg6A12(OH)16]CO3·4H2O, has been investigated."
[2] "The highest molybdenum concentrations (2530 wt.%) are for those catalysts prepared at pH 4.5 by the addition of nitric acid to the reaction solutionwhether by the impregnation of the commercial hydrotalcite with ADM (15 and 19) or with terephthalic acid followed by ADM 16 or sodium molybdate 17 or the in situ preparation from magnesium and aluminium nitrates, terephthalic acid and ADM 11."
[3] "The idea is that intercalation of, e.g. glycerol or terephthalic acid will open up the interlayer space of a hydrotalcite so facilitating the subsequent incorporation of molybdate. Our experience (Table 1) was that glycerol did not enhance the molybdate uptake or greatly increase the interlayer spacing (4, 8)."
[4] "Comparing the catalytic behaviour of the molybdenum containing catalysts with the commercial hydrotalcite (Rc), we see that molybdenum enhances activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation and selectivity, but hardly activity, in non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Thus, molybdenum has a specific catalytic role especially in oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "We regard the intercalated hydrotalcite as the precursor of the active catalyst, a well-dispersed magnesium polymolybdate."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation started in the 1980s. Research in this area has evolved significantly since then, focusing on optimizing the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the activity and selectivity of vanadium oxide catalysts. Higher metal loading can lead to increased activity, while the choice of carrier and support surface area can affect the dispersion of the vanadium species, impacting the catalyst's efficiency.

3. Since the 1980s, researchers have investigated the use of various carriers and supports to enhance the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts. These carriers and supports can influence the reaction pathways, stability, and the ability of the catalyst to resist sintering.

4. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by the interactions between the vanadium, the carrier/support, and the reaction environment. Factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of other reactants or inhibitors can alter the valence state of vanadium, affecting its catalytic activity.

5. The intercalated hydrotalcite is considered the precursor of the active catalyst, a well-dispersed magnesium polymolybdate, which shows high efficiency and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
