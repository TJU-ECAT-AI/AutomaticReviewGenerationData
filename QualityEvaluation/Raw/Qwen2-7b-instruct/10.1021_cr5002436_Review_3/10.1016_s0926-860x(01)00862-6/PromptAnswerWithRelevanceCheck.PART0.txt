<p>Efficient catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is much sought as a means of converting propane to a reactive chemical feedstock, propene [13].</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation may be non-oxidative (sometimes called static), i.e. without dioxygen in the reaction mixture, or oxidative, with a reaction mixture that includes dioxygen.</p>
<p>Supported vanadates [38] and molybdates (especially, magnesium molybdate) [915] have been much studied as cat- alysts for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation proceeds according to the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the source of oxygen for the oxidation is lattice oxygen from the catalyst.</p>
<p>The rate-determining step is irreversible disso- ciative chemisorption of propane, the -CH bond dissociating to give an isopropyl radical and H.</p>
<p>The catalysis requires both redox and acidbase functionality of the catalyst [29,4345].</p>
<p>Catalytic properties depend strongly on the compo- sition, structure and method of preparation of the cat- alysts.</p>
<p>Among V-hydrotalcite catalysts those derived from decavanadate are more active than those from pyrovanadate [29].</p>
<p>Magnesium molybdate catalysts are of particular interest and provide a reference point for our work [9,4446].</p>
<p>The efficient catalysts contain a certain excess of MoO3 over MgMoO4.</p>
<p>There is a correlation between Mo(VI) reducibility and activity [9].</p>
<p>The presence of a Mo(V) species, probably hav- ing a distorted pyramid structure, MoO55, is shown by ESR [47,48].</p>
<p>The highest molybdenum concentrations (2530 wt.%) are for those catalysts prepared at pH
4.5 by the addition of nitric acid to the reaction
solutionwhether by the impregnation of the com- mercial hydrotalcite with ADM (15 and 19) or with terephthalic acid followed by ADM 16 or sodium molybdate 17 or the in situ preparation from mag- nesium and aluminium nitrates, terephthalic acid and ADM 11.</p>
<p>The idea is that intercalation of, e.g. glycerol or terephthalic acid will open up the interlayer space of a hydrotalcite so facilitating the subsequent incor- poration of molybdate.</p>
<p>However, when the impregna- tion is carried out at pH 4.5 in the presence of nitric acid (19, 15) molybdate uptake is high (3133 wt.%) with both the uncalcined and calcined materials.</p>
<p>The question also arises whether our materi- als contain any MoO3, an expected product of the thermal decomposition of AHM and ADM.</p>
<p>Comparing the catalytic behaviour of the molyb- denum containing catalysts with the commer- cial hydrotalcite (Rc), we see that molybdenum enhances activity and selectivity in oxidative de- hydrogenation and selectivity, but hardly activity,in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>We compare our results with literature data for both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in Fig. 4 by plotting propene yield (Y, Sec- tion 2.4.1) versus conversion at 500600 C for the catalysts indicated.</p>

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation started in the 1980s. Research in this area has evolved significantly since then, focusing on understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts, influenced by carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The choice of carrier and its surface area can affect the dispersion of vanadium species, impacting their reactivity and stability. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium in the catalyst, which can alter its catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. The behavior of vanadium catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions depends on the type of carrier used. Decavanadate-derived hydrotalcite catalysts tend to be more active than pyrovanadate-derived ones. Magnesium molybdate catalysts are of particular interest, providing a reference point for comparison with vanadium catalysts. Efficient molybdenum/magnesium catalysts contain a certain excess of MoO3 over MgMoO4, showing correlations between Mo(VI) reducibility and activity, with Mo(V) species having a distorted pyramid structure contributing to their catalytic efficiency.

4. The highest molybdenum concentrations in the catalysts are achieved by preparing them at pH 4.5 with the addition of nitric acid. This method facilitates the incorporation of molybdate into the catalyst, enhancing its activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly towards propene production.

5. The intercalation of glycerol or terephthalic acid into hydrotalcite materials is intended to open up the interlayer space, facilitating the subsequent incorporation of molybdate. However, nitric acid is found to be more effective in enhancing molybdate uptake and interlayer spacing, leading to higher molybdenum concentrations and improved catalytic performance.

6. Comparative studies with literature data indicate that vanadium catalysts, especially those derived from decavanadate, exhibit higher activity than molybdenum catalysts. However, molybdenum catalysts offer better selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The layered structure of the catalysts is found to be crucial, as it is destroyed at temperatures around 500-600°C, leading to the formation of MgAl2O4, MgMo2O7, and MgMoO4.

1. 自1980年代以来，对以二氧化钒为基的催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品在烷烃脱氢中的应用进行了探索。该领域的研究已显著发展，重点在于理解这些催化剂中钒物种的性质及其在载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载等因素的影响下的行为。

2. 载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载是影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质的关键因素。所选择的载体及其表面积可以影响钒物种的分散性，进而影响其反应性和稳定性。金属负载决定了催化剂中钒的浓度，这可以改变其催化活性和选择性。

3. 在脱氢反应中，不同载体的钒催化剂的行为取决于使用的载体类型。从十二钒酸盐衍生的水滑石催化剂通常比从焦磷酸盐衍生的更活跃。镁钼酸盐催化剂特别值得关注，为与钒催化剂比较提供了参考点。高效钼/镁催化剂含有钼氧化物（MoO3）相对于镁钼酸盐（MgMoO4）的特定过量，显示了Mo(VI)还原性和活性之间的相关性，Mo(V)物种具有扭曲的金字塔结构，对它们的催化效率有贡献。

4. 最高的钼浓度在pH值为4.5时通过添加硝酸盐制备催化剂时实现。这种方法促进了钼酸盐在催化剂中的掺入，增强了其在氧化脱氢反应中的活性和选择性，特别是在丙烯生产的方向上。

5. 将甘油或对苯二甲酸酯等物质的插入水滑石材料中旨在打开层间空间，从而促进随后的钼掺入。然而，发现硝酸盐比甘油或对苯二甲酸酯更有效地提高了钼的吸收率和层间距，导致更高的钼浓度和改善的催化性能。

6. 与文献数据的比较研究表明，与钼催化剂相比，尤其是从十二钒酸盐衍生的催化剂，钒催化剂表现出更高的活性。然而，钼催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中提供更好的选择性。催化剂的层状结构被认为是关键的，因为它们在约500-600°C的温度下被破坏，形成MgAl2O4、MgMo2O7和MgMoO4。

The factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation include their potential cost-effectiveness, stability, and the ability to produce high-quality propylene. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the structure-reactivity relationships, particularly concerning the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the activity and selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts. For instance, catalysts with a high vanadium loading and a specific carrier type often exhibit enhanced dehydrogenation activity and selectivity towards propylene. The surface area of the support can also influence the dispersion of vanadium species, impacting the catalyst's overall performance. These findings suggest that optimizing these parameters can lead to the development of more efficient and selective dehydrogenation catalysts based on vanadium oxides.

The catalysts prepared in this study show similar patterns in catalytic chemistry, with the slow step being the initial C-H bond breaking leading to the formation of an adsorbed isopropyl radical. This is not surprising since the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves a series of reactions that ultimately result in the production of propene, and the catalysts facilitate these processes efficiently. In oxidative dehydrogenation, catalyst 16 demonstrates notably higher selectivity towards propene, nearly reaching 100%, compared to the homogeneous reaction, which suggests its superior capability in selectively converting propane to propene under the tested conditions.

探索使用范德华氧化物作为Pt和CrOx的替代品进行烷基脱氢的原因包括它们可能的成本效益、稳定性和生成高质量丙烯的能力。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经显著发展，特别是在理解结构反应性关系方面，特别是对于这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对范德华氧化物基催化剂的活性和选择性起着关键作用。例如，高范德华负载和特定载体类型的催化剂通常显示出增强的脱氢活性和丙烯选择性。支持表面的面积也可以影响范德华物种的分散，从而影响催化剂的整体性能。这些发现表明，优化这些参数可以导致开发出更高效和选择性的基于范德华氧化物的脱氢催化剂。

在本研究中制备的催化剂表现出相似的催化化学模式，其中缓慢步骤是初始C-H键断裂，形成吸附的异丙基自由基。这并不令人惊讶，因为丙烷的氧化脱氢涉及一系列反应，最终产生丙烯，并且催化剂促进了这些过程的有效性。在氧化脱氢中，催化剂16显示出对丙烯的显着更高选择性，接近100%，与同质反应相比，这表明其在在一定条件下选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯的优越能力。
