The factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation include their potential cost-effectiveness, stability, and the ability to produce high-quality propylene. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the structure-reactivity relationships, particularly concerning the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the activity and selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts. For instance, catalysts with a high vanadium loading and a specific carrier type often exhibit enhanced dehydrogenation activity and selectivity towards propylene. The surface area of the support can also influence the dispersion of vanadium species, impacting the catalyst's overall performance. These findings suggest that optimizing these parameters can lead to the development of more efficient and selective dehydrogenation catalysts based on vanadium oxides.

The catalysts prepared in this study show similar patterns in catalytic chemistry, with the slow step being the initial C-H bond breaking leading to the formation of an adsorbed isopropyl radical. This is not surprising since the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves a series of reactions that ultimately result in the production of propene, and the catalysts facilitate these processes efficiently. In oxidative dehydrogenation, catalyst 16 demonstrates notably higher selectivity towards propene, nearly reaching 100%, compared to the homogeneous reaction, which suggests its superior capability in selectively converting propane to propene under the tested conditions.

探索使用范德华氧化物作为Pt和CrOx的替代品进行烷基脱氢的原因包括它们可能的成本效益、稳定性和生成高质量丙烯的能力。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经显著发展，特别是在理解结构反应性关系方面，特别是对于这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对范德华氧化物基催化剂的活性和选择性起着关键作用。例如，高范德华负载和特定载体类型的催化剂通常显示出增强的脱氢活性和丙烯选择性。支持表面的面积也可以影响范德华物种的分散，从而影响催化剂的整体性能。这些发现表明，优化这些参数可以导致开发出更高效和选择性的基于范德华氧化物的脱氢催化剂。

在本研究中制备的催化剂表现出相似的催化化学模式，其中缓慢步骤是初始C-H键断裂，形成吸附的异丙基自由基。这并不令人惊讶，因为丙烷的氧化脱氢涉及一系列反应，最终产生丙烯，并且催化剂促进了这些过程的有效性。在氧化脱氢中，催化剂16显示出对丙烯的显着更高选择性，接近100%，与同质反应相比，这表明其在在一定条件下选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯的优越能力。
