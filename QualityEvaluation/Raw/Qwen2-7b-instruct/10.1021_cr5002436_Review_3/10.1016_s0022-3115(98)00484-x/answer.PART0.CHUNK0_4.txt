[1] "In the process of dismantling and declassifying nuclear weapons, the US intends to convert much of the Pu metal to oxide using a hydride-oxidation process [1]."
[2] "However, unlike reactor grade Pu, weapons grade Pu contains minor additions of gallium in order to stabilize the d-phase, making the alloy easily machinable."
[3] "Consequently, to assure proper cladding and fuel performance, Ga must be largely removed from weapons grade plutonium before it can be processed and used."
[4] "In order to avoid aqueous processing of this material, which could produce considerable additional waste, we have proceeded toward the development of a relatively simple thermal process for removing gallium from PuO2x, with the objective of achieving parts per million levels."
[5] "Our proposed removal process involves heating the oxide in an ArH2 environment, probably at temperatures in excess of 1000C, producing as the primary gaseous product Ga2O(g) from decomposition of the Ga2O3 present in the mixture."
[6] "The primary focus of this paper is on the nature of the deposition product, which is of importance for assessing a means for gallium collection."

The exploration of gallium oxide-based catalysts for the removal of gallium from plutonium oxide has been driven by the need to process weapons-grade plutonium safely and efficiently. The goal is to develop a thermal process that can remove gallium from PuO2x to parts per million levels without the use of aqueous processing, which could generate additional waste. This is achieved by heating the oxide in an Ar-H2 environment at temperatures exceeding 1000°C, resulting in the vaporization of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) to form Ga2O(g). The deposited product is crucial for gauging the method of gallium collection. The process aims to ensure the proper cladding and fuel performance of the processed plutonium.

武器级钚的处理需要安全、高效地去除钚氧化物中的镓。为此，人们探索了镓氧化物基催化剂，以实现将镓从PuO2x降低到百万分之几的水平，并避免使用可能导致额外废物产生的水处理过程。通过在氩-氢气环境中加热氧化物至超过1000°C，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）分解形成Ga2O(g)，这是主要产物。沉积产物对于评估镓收集方法至关重要。此过程旨在确保处理后钚的适当包覆和燃料性能。
