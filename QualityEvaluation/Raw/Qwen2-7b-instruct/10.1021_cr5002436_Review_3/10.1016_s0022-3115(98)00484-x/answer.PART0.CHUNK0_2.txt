1. The primary focus of the paper is to describe the nature of the deposition product resulting from the thermal vaporization and deposition of gallium oxide in hydrogen, emphasizing its relevance to gallium collection methods.

2. Before any efforts to remove gallium, it is anticipated that the concentration of Ga2O3 in a typical PuO2 feedstock will be around 0.01.

3. Complex equilibrium calculations were performed using the computer program SOLGASMIX and available thermodynamic data.

4. As the Ga2O(g) gas travels to cooler areas of the furnace, it might undergo back reactions with H2(g) and H2O(g), leading to the condensation of Ga(l) and Ga2O3 on the furnace walls.

5. The calculations were carried out under the assumption that the gas mixture consisted of 1 atmosphere of 6% H2 and a balance of inert gases like Ar or He.

1. 本文的主要关注点是描述在氢气中热蒸发和沉积镓氧化物的沉积产物的性质，强调其对镓收集方法的重要性。

2. 在不进行任何镓去除努力之前，预期典型PuO2原料中的Ga2O3浓度约为0.01。

3. 复杂的平衡计算使用了计算机程序SOLGASMIX和可用的热力学数据进行。

4. 随着Ga2O(g)气体向炉膛的较冷区域移动，它可能会与H2(g)和H2O(g)发生反向反应，并在炉壁上凝结形成Ga(l)和Ga2O3。

5. 进行计算的假设条件是混合气体由1个大气压的6% H2和Ar或He等惰性气体的平衡组成。
