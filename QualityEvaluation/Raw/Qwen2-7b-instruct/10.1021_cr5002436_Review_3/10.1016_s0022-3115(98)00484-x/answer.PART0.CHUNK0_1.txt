The nature of the deposition product, which is crucial for gauging methods of gallium collection, is detailed in the paper. The characterization uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The data align with thermodynamic forecasts, indicating that the deposition product comprises Ga2O3 and metallic Ga. The XPS analysis further reveals an intermediate oxidation state for Ga. On copper substrates, the metallic Ga concentration rises and the Ga2O3 concentration falls with increasing sputtering depth, implying that the outermost layers of the deposit's metallic Ga is susceptible to oxidation upon air exposure.

本文详细阐述了沉积产物的性质，这对于评估镓收集方法至关重要。使用X射线光电子能谱（XPS）对沉积产物进行了表征。数据与热力学预测相吻合，表明沉积产物包含Ga2O3和金属Ga。XPS分析还揭示了Ga的中间氧化态。在铜基板上，金属Ga的浓度随蚀刻深度的增加而增加，Ga2O3的浓度则减少，这表明沉积物最外层的金属Ga在空气暴露下容易被氧化。
