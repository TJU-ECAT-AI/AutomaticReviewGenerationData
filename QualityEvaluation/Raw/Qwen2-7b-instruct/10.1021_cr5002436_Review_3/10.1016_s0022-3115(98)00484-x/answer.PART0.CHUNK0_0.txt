[1] "In the process of dismantling and declassify- ing nuclear weapons, the US intends to convert much of the Pu metal to oxide using a hydrideoxidation process [1]."
[2] "This process yields a PuO2x powder that potentially can be incorporated into a mixed oxide nuclear fuel, a mixture of PuO2 and UO2, or perhaps one day in an advanced non-fertile fuel."
[3] "However, unlike reactor grade Pu, weapons grade Pu contains minor additions of gallium in order to stabilize the d-phase, making the alloy easily machinable."
[4] "Consequently, to assure proper cladding and fuel performance, Ga must be largely removed from weapons grade plutonium before it can be processed and used."
[5] "In order to avoid aqueous processing of this material, which could produce considerable additional waste, we have proceeded toward the development of a relatively simple thermal process for removing gallium from PuO2x."
[6] "our proposed removal process involves heating the oxide in an ArH2 environment, probably at temperatures in excess of 1000C, producing as the primary gaseous product Ga2O(g) from decomposition of the Ga2O3 present in the mixture."
[7] "As described below, the equilibrium partial pressure of Ga2O(g) above Ga2O3 is relatively high in a reducing atmosphere."
[8] "Once evolved, the Ga2O(g) is swept away from the PuO2x by the gas stream and must be collected and removed from the heat-treatment system."
[9] "In this paper, we briey communicate some of the important fundamentals of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the processes of vaporization and deposition."
[10] "The primary focus of this paper is on the nature of the deposition product, which is of importance for assessing a means for gallium collection."
[11] "The deposition products are characterized in detail using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."

1. The primary driving force behind exploring vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation is the reduction of costs and environmental impact associated with the production of hydrocarbons. The research has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst properties such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance activity and selectivity. Vanadium species in these catalysts can exhibit diverse behaviors depending on these factors, influencing the efficiency of paraffin dehydrogenation.
