Thermal vaporization and deposition of gallium oxide in hydrogen Darryl P. Butt *, Youngsoo Park, Thomas N. Taylor Materials Science and Technology Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Materials Technology: Metallurgy, MST-6, P.O. Box 1663, M.S. G755, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA Received 20 May 1998; accepted 13 July 1998 Abstract The thermodynamics of gallium oxide vaporization and deposition in Ar6% H2 at elevated temperatures are de- scribed. It is shown that Ga2O3 vaporizes in H2 as Ga2O(g) at elevated temperatures. During thermal processing the Ga2O(g) moves to cooler zones of the furnace, back reacts with H2(g) and H2O(g) and condenses out as Ga(l) and Ga2O3(s). Upon removal from the furnace, the exposed Ga forms a ubiquitous surface oxide of Ga2O3. X-ray pho- toelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine heat treated Ga2O3 powders and vaporization products deposited onto SiO2 and Cu substrates. In agreement with the thermodynamic predictions, these data demonstrate that the de- position product contained Ga2O3 and metallic Ga. Analysis of the XPS spectra also revealed an intermediate oxidation state for Ga. The precise bonding of this state could not be demonstrated conclusively, but it is suggested that it may be solid Ga2O. For coherent product deposition on Cu the metallic Ga concentration increases and the Ga2O3 concen- tration decreases with sputtering depth, suggesting the metallic Ga in the outermost layers of the deposit is readily oxidized during air exposure. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
There is currently interest in burning weapons grade plutonium in nuclear reactors, making use of its valuable energy while at the same time reducing certain dangers associated with its potential for nuclear weapons pro- liferation. In the process of dismantling and declassify- ing nuclear weapons, the US intends to convert much of the Pu metal to oxide using a hydrideoxidation process [1]. This process yields a PuO2x powder that potentially can be incorporated into a mixed oxide nuclear fuel, a mixture of PuO2 and UO2, or perhaps one day in an advanced non-fertile fuel. However, unlike reactor grade Pu, weapons grade Pu contains minor additions of gal- lium in order to stabilize the d-phase, making the alloy easily machinable. Gallium is a known embrittling agent and alloys rapidly with most metals. Consequently, to assure proper cladding and fuel performance, Ga must be largely removed from weapons grade plutonium be- fore it can be processed and used. In order to avoid aqueous processing of this material, which could pro- duce considerable additional waste, we have proceeded toward the development of a relatively simple thermal process for removing gallium from PuO2x, with the objective of achieving parts per million levels. our pro- posed removal process involves heating the oxide in an ArH2 environment, probably at temperatures in excess of 1000C, producing as the primary gaseous product Ga2O(g) from decomposition of the Ga2O3 present in the mixture. As described below, the equilibrium partial pressure of Ga2O(g) above Ga2O3 is relatively high in a reducing atmosphere. Once evolved, the Ga2O(g) is swept away from the PuO2x by the gas stream and must be collected and removed from the heat-treatment sys- tem.

kinetics of the processes of vaporization and deposition.
The primary focus of this paper is on the nature of the deposition product, which is of importance for assessing a means for gallium collection. The deposition products are characterized in detail using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
2. Thermodynamics of gallium oxide vaporization in
hydrogen Thermodynamic data for the GaOH system were collected [29] and free energies of formation were t,using stepwise multiple linear regression, to the equation DGf  a  bT  cT 1  dT 2  eT 3  fT ln T;1 where af are constants, and T is temperature in Kelvin.
Table 1 shows some of the data pertinent to this brief analysis. Note that other gaseous products such as Ga, GaH, GaO, Ga2O2, and Ga2O3 are not included in these analyses because their equilibrium partial pressures are comparatively low. The constants in Table 1 were used to calculate temperature dependent expressions for the vaporization behavior of gallium oxide from doped PuO2 in Ar6% H2. A temperature-dependent expres- sion for the free energy of reaction can be determined from the mass-action equation Ga2O3s  2H2g ! Ga2Og  2H2Og:2 From this equation the following relationship was de- rived from which Ga2O(g) partial pressures can be cal- culated:pGa2O  aGa2O3p2

Alternatively, the vaporization of Ga2O(g) may be assessed using the mass action equation Ga2O3s ! Ga2Og  O2g;4 where the partial pressure of Ga2O(g) may be calculated using the equation pGa2O  aGa2O3 pO2 exp 75:69396  3:7071

:5 Eq. (5) may be substituted for Eq. (3) by considering how the partial pressure of oxygen is controlled by the H2/H2O ratio according to buer reaction H2g  1=2O2g ! H2Og:6 It is apparent from Eqs. (5) and (6) that the higher the H2/H2O ratio, the higher will be pGa2O (i.e., pGa2O is inversely related to pO2). Thus, the vaporization of Ga2O would be expected to be more rapid in dry versus moist hydrogen. The equations described above can be used to calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of Ga2O above various PuO2Ga2O3 solid solutions. In a typical PuO2 feedstock, it is anticipated that aGa2O3 will be on the order of 0.01 prior to any eorts to remove Ga.
However, at this date, the activity of Ga2O3 in a typical PuO2 feedstock powder is not precisely known; there- fore, for the purpose of illustration, we must assume certain values of aGa2O3. Fig. 1 shows how the vapor- ization behavior varies with environment as a function of aGa2O3. The calculations were done assuming the gas was a dry mixture of 1 atm of 6% H2 and a balance of inert gas, such as Ar or He. This gas composition rep- resents the experimental gases we are using in our Ga removal studies. It is apparent from Fig. 1, that the vaporization rate under the reducing eect of H2 is rel- atively high, for example at 1000C (1273 K) pGa2O varies between 104 and 102 for aGa2O3 between 1  106 and 1, respectively. Thus, in a dry hydrogen environment, at elevated temperatures, Ga2O3 will vaporize relatively rapidly according to Eq. (2).
Fig. 2 shows the inuence of temperature on the calculated equilibrium composition when 1 mole of Ga2O3 is reacted with 100 moles of Ar6% H2. These complex equilibria were calculated using the computer program SOLGASMIX [10] and available thermody- namic data [29]. The possible formation of the con- densed phases Ga2O and Ga(OH)3 was ignored. Fig. 2 illustrates that at temperatures greater than 720C, Ga2O3 will react with H2 forming only Ga2O(g). Below this temperature, Ga2O(g) will react with H2 forming some Ga(l) (note the melting point of Ga is 30C).

Further, it is predicted that some of the Ga2O(g) will also back react with H2O(g) forming Ga2O3. Thus, we anticipate that in Ar6% H2, at elevated temperatures (>720C) Ga2O3 will vaporize to Ga2O(g). As this gas travels in the gas stream to cooler regions of the furnace, Ga2O(g) may back react with H2(g) and H2O(g) and condense on the furnace walls forming Ga(l) and Ga2O3.
It should be emphasized that these calculations do not preclude the possible condensation of Ga2O or Ga(OH)3 species.
3. Experimental procedures
In order to validate or disprove the deposition pro- cess predicted from the aforementioned thermodynamic calculations, Ga2O3 powder was placed in the hot zone of a controlled atmosphere furnace. The Ga2O3 was
99.999% pure powder (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) with
the major impurity being 4.0 ppm Sn. Ultra high purity Ar6% H2 was owed through the furnace. The gas was gettered using calcium sulfate and 650C copper chips to achieve H2O partial pressures well below 1 ppm. De- position products were collected near the end of the furnace on either fused SiO2 or Cu substrates, i.e., inert or reactive substrates, respectively. The deposition products were always a dark, powdery substance. In the case of products deposited onto SiO2, the residue was carefully removed and mounted as a coherent layer on In foil for analysis. In the case of products deposited onto Cu, the coated substrate was analyzed intact.
The samples were analyzed by XPS in a multitech- nique surface analysis apparatus (Model 5600ci, Physi- cal Electronics, Eden Prairie,
MN).
Spectrometer linearity and absolute energy positions were calibrated to give the Au 4f7=2, Ag 3d5=2, and Cu 2p3=2 peak posi- tions within 0.10 eV of 84.00, 368.30, and 932.65 eV binding energy (BE) [11]. Most of the data were taken using unltered Mg or Al radiation. One exception to this was the sputter-proling measurement on the coated Cu substrate, which was done using a monochromatized Al source. Excitation with the Al sources was preferred as it eliminated the strong overlap between the C 1s and Ga LMM transitions. The C 1s peak is important for carbon-based energy referencing. For this reason only data taken with the Al sources are reported herein. The spectra were taken at a pass energy of 23.5 eV to insure high quality peak shapes. During analyses the spec- trometer aperture settings were set to allow examination of less than one square millimeter of the sample. Sputter proling was done in an XPS mode using 4 keV argon ions with a current density of 6 lA/cm2 and rastering over a (4  4) mm2 area. The sputtering rate for these parameters was measured at 1.5 nm per minute on a
