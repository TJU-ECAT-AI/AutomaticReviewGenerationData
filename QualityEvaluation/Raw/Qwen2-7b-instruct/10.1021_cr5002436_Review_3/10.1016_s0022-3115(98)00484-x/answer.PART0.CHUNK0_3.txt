[1] "It is shown that Ga2O3 vaporizes in H2 as Ga2O(g) at elevated temperatures."
[2] "Once evolved, the Ga2O(g) is swept away from the PuO2x by the gas stream and must be collected and removed from the heat-treatment system."
[3] "These calculations were done assuming the gas was a dry mixture of 1 atm of 6% H2 and a balance of inert gas, such as Ar or He."
[4] "It is predicted that some of the Ga2O(g) will also back react with H2O(g) forming Ga2O3."
[5] "The samples were analyzed by XPS in a multitechnique surface analysis apparatus (Model 5600ci, Physical Electronics, Eden Prairie, MN)."
[6] "Excitation with the Al sources was preferred as it eliminated the strong overlap between the C 1s and Ga LMM transitions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) vaporizes in hydrogen (H2) at elevated temperatures, transforming into Ga2O(g).
2. After vaporization, Ga2O(g) is carried away by the gas flow and needs to be collected and removed from the heat-treatment system.
3. The calculations were performed under conditions of dry gas mixture containing 6% H2 and a balance of inert gases like Ar or He.
4. Some of the Ga2O(g) produced is predicted to react back with water vapor (H2O(g)) to form Ga2O3.
5. The analysis of the deposition products was conducted using a multitechnique surface analysis apparatus from Physical Electronics.
6. The use of aluminum (Al) sources was favored in the analysis due to its ability to eliminate overlapping signals between carbon (C) and gallium (Ga) transitions.

1. 在高温下，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）在氢气（H2）中蒸发，转化为Ga2O(g)。
2. 蒸发后，Ga2O(g)被气体流带走，并需要从热处理系统中收集和移除。
3. 计算是在干性气体混合物中进行的，该混合物包含6%的H2和Ar或He等惰性气体的平衡。
4. 部分生成的Ga2O(g)预计将与水蒸气（H2O(g)）反应形成Ga2O3。
5. 分析沉积产物使用了Physical Electronics的多技术表面分析装置。
6. 使用铝（Al）源在分析中被优先考虑，因为它能够消除碳（C）和镓（Ga）过渡之间的重叠信号。
