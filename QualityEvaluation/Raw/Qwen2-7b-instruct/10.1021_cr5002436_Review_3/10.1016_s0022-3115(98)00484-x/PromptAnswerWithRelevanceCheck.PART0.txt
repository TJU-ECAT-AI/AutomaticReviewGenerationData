[1] "In the process of dismantling and declassify- ing nuclear weapons, the US intends to convert much of the Pu metal to oxide using a hydrideoxidation process [1]."
[2] "This process yields a PuO2x powder that potentially can be incorporated into a mixed oxide nuclear fuel, a mixture of PuO2 and UO2, or perhaps one day in an advanced non-fertile fuel."
[3] "However, unlike reactor grade Pu, weapons grade Pu contains minor additions of gallium in order to stabilize the d-phase, making the alloy easily machinable."
[4] "Consequently, to assure proper cladding and fuel performance, Ga must be largely removed from weapons grade plutonium before it can be processed and used."
[5] "In order to avoid aqueous processing of this material, which could produce considerable additional waste, we have proceeded toward the development of a relatively simple thermal process for removing gallium from PuO2x."
[6] "our proposed removal process involves heating the oxide in an ArH2 environment, probably at temperatures in excess of 1000C, producing as the primary gaseous product Ga2O(g) from decomposition of the Ga2O3 present in the mixture."
[7] "As described below, the equilibrium partial pressure of Ga2O(g) above Ga2O3 is relatively high in a reducing atmosphere."
[8] "Once evolved, the Ga2O(g) is swept away from the PuO2x by the gas stream and must be collected and removed from the heat-treatment system."
[9] "In this paper, we briey communicate some of the important fundamentals of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the processes of vaporization and deposition."
[10] "The primary focus of this paper is on the nature of the deposition product, which is of importance for assessing a means for gallium collection."
[11] "The deposition products are characterized in detail using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."

1. The primary driving force behind exploring vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation is the reduction of costs and environmental impact associated with the production of hydrocarbons. The research has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing catalyst properties such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance activity and selectivity. Vanadium species in these catalysts can exhibit diverse behaviors depending on these factors, influencing the efficiency of paraffin dehydrogenation.

The nature of the deposition product, which is crucial for gauging methods of gallium collection, is detailed in the paper. The characterization uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The data align with thermodynamic forecasts, indicating that the deposition product comprises Ga2O3 and metallic Ga. The XPS analysis further reveals an intermediate oxidation state for Ga. On copper substrates, the metallic Ga concentration rises and the Ga2O3 concentration falls with increasing sputtering depth, implying that the outermost layers of the deposit's metallic Ga is susceptible to oxidation upon air exposure.

本文详细阐述了沉积产物的性质，这对于评估镓收集方法至关重要。使用X射线光电子能谱（XPS）对沉积产物进行了表征。数据与热力学预测相吻合，表明沉积产物包含Ga2O3和金属Ga。XPS分析还揭示了Ga的中间氧化态。在铜基板上，金属Ga的浓度随蚀刻深度的增加而增加，Ga2O3的浓度则减少，这表明沉积物最外层的金属Ga在空气暴露下容易被氧化。

The exploration of gallium oxide-based catalysts for the removal of gallium from plutonium oxide has been driven by the need to process weapons-grade plutonium safely and efficiently. The goal is to develop a thermal process that can remove gallium from PuO2x to parts per million levels without the use of aqueous processing, which could generate additional waste. This is achieved by heating the oxide in an Ar-H2 environment at temperatures exceeding 1000°C, resulting in the vaporization of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) to form Ga2O(g). The deposited product is crucial for gauging the method of gallium collection. The process aims to ensure the proper cladding and fuel performance of the processed plutonium.
