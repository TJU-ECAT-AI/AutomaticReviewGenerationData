<p>Indeed, the oxidized form of Ga/ZSM-5, where the main fraction of gallium ions is assumed to be present in the form of isolated gallyl ions, was found to be initially the most active for light alkane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>This finding was explained by rapid reduction of the gallyl ions under the reductive conditions of propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Clearly, currently available theoretical results do not satisfactorily agree with such experimental observations.</p>
<p>However, the oxidized catalyst deactivates with time on stream.</p>
<p>After prolonged reaction, the dehydrogenation activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 becomes equal to that of a catalyst containing predominantly Ga+ ions.</p>
<p>It was estimated that on average 1000 molecules of propane were converted per the oxidized gallium site before being reduced to Ga+.</p>
<p>Clearly, gallyl ions cannot be considered as catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the properties and performance of vanadium oxide catalysts. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, the carrier type can affect the dispersion of vanadium oxide, impacting its reactivity and stability. The support surface area influences the specific surface area and porosity of the catalyst, which in turn affects the accessibility of reactants and products. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium species, impacting the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity towards desired products. Through systematic studies, researchers aim to optimize these parameters to enhance the catalytic activity and lifetime of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.
