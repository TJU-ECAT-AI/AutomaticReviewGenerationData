<p>Indeed, the oxidized form of Ga/ZSM-5, where the main fraction of gallium ions is assumed to be present in the form of isolated gallyl ions, was found to be initially the most active for light alkane dehydrogenation.10 In addition to this, a high activity of the oxidized gallium-exchanged zeolites in the H/D reaction has been confirmed both experimentally 11 and theoretically. 12 However, the oxidized catalyst deactivates with time on stream. After prolonged reaction, the dehydrogenation activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 becomes equal to that of a catalyst containing predominantly Ga+ ions.10 This finding was explained by rapid reduction of the gallyl ions under the reductive conditions of propane dehydrogenation. It was estimated that on average 1000 molecules of propane were converted per the oxidized gallium site before being reduced to Ga+.</p>

The study explores the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites. The research employs density functional theory cluster modeling to analyze the mechanism. Key points include:

1. Initial activation of ethane occurs either through heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule. 

2. Both paths are favored thermodynamically and kinetically over initial CH activation over reduced gallium species. However, regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. 

3. Reduction of the gallyl ions upon catalytic reaction is preferred over regeneration of the active sites. 

4. Side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. 

5. Catalytic cycles can occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, but these sites cannot be responsible for the stable catalytic activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

本文研究了氧化镓/ZSM-5（GaO+）离子作为氧化镓活性位点模型的乙烷脱氢机制。通过密度泛函理论簇建模分析了这一机制的关键点包括：

1. 乙烷初始激活可通过过gallyl离子上的CH键异裂或由外层氧原子氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子，遵循烷基型机制。

2. 两种途径在热力学和动力学上均优于初始CH键活化过程中的还原镓物种。

3. gallyl离子的再生非常困难，而gallyl离子的快速还原在丙烷脱氢的还原条件下更受青睐。

4. 讨论了乙醇在GaO+位点的侧向反应。

5. 脱氢循环可以在gallyl离子上发生，涉及稳定中间体的一步乙烷分子转换，但这些位点无法解释氧化Ga/ZSM-5催化剂的稳定催化活性。
