<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach.</p>
<p>Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule.</p>
<p>In the latter case, ethanol rapidly reacts with the adsorption site producing a stable intermediate corresponding to the so-called carbenium initial activation.</p>
<p>Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species.</p>
<p>The subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult.</p>
<p>In addition, possible side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites were discussed.</p>
<p>Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>

1. The study focused on the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites, employing density functional theory cluster modeling. 
2. Ethane activation occurred through either heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond by the gallyl ion or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom, leading to formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule. 
3. The carbenium activation mechanism was favored over the alkyl mechanism in terms of kinetics and thermodynamics.
4. The regeneration of the gallyl ion proved challenging, suggesting limitations in its catalytic activity.
5. The paper also explored side reactions involving ethanol conversion over GaO+ sites.
6. Despite the potential for catalytic cycles, the gallyl ions were not found to be responsible for the stable catalytic activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.
