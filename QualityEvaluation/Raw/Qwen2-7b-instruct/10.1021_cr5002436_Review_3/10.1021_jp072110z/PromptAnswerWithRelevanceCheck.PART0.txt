<p>Indeed, the oxidized form of Ga/ZSM-5, where the main fraction of gallium ions is assumed to be present in the form of isolated gallyl ions, was found to be initially the most active for light alkane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>This finding was explained by rapid reduction of the gallyl ions under the reductive conditions of propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Clearly, currently available theoretical results do not satisfactorily agree with such experimental observations.</p>
<p>However, the oxidized catalyst deactivates with time on stream.</p>
<p>After prolonged reaction, the dehydrogenation activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 becomes equal to that of a catalyst containing predominantly Ga+ ions.</p>
<p>It was estimated that on average 1000 molecules of propane were converted per the oxidized gallium site before being reduced to Ga+.</p>
<p>Clearly, gallyl ions cannot be considered as catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the properties and performance of vanadium oxide catalysts. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, the carrier type can affect the dispersion of vanadium oxide, impacting its reactivity and stability. The support surface area influences the specific surface area and porosity of the catalyst, which in turn affects the accessibility of reactants and products. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium species, impacting the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity towards desired products. Through systematic studies, researchers aim to optimize these parameters to enhance the catalytic activity and lifetime of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. Carrier type affects the dispersion of the vanadium oxide, influencing its reactivity and stability. Support surface area impacts the accessibility of the active sites, affecting the reaction rates. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium species, impacting the overall catalytic performance.

3. The nature of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts can vary depending on the preparation conditions and reaction conditions. These species play crucial roles in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, with the ability to promote both hydrogenolysis and hydrogen shift reactions. Understanding the specific types of vanadium species present and their reactivity under different conditions is essential for optimizing catalyst performance.

The study explores the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites. The research employs density functional theory cluster modeling to analyze the mechanism. Key points include:

1. Initial activation of ethane occurs either through heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule. 

2. Both paths are favored thermodynamically and kinetically over initial CH activation over reduced gallium species. However, regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. 

3. Reduction of the gallyl ions upon catalytic reaction is preferred over regeneration of the active sites. 

4. Side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. 

5. Catalytic cycles can occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, but these sites cannot be responsible for the stable catalytic activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.
