<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach.</p>
<p>Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule.</p>
<p>In the latter case, ethanol rapidly reacts with the adsorption site producing a stable intermediate corresponding to the so-called carbenium initial activation.</p>
<p>Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species.</p>
<p>The subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult. It is shown that the reduction of the gallyl ions upon the catalytic reaction is strongly preferred over the regeneration of the active sites.</p>
<p>Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>

The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites, using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane occurs through heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion or oxidation by an extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. The carbenium mechanism is thermodynamically and kinetically favored over the alkyl mechanism. The regeneration of the gallyl ion is challenging, with reduction being favored over regeneration. Multiple catalytic cycles can occur, but these sites are not the primary source of stable catalytic activity for the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

研究集中在使用密度泛函理论簇模型方法对氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石中乙烷脱氢化在GaO+离子上的催化作用。初始乙烷活化可以通过通过GaO+离子的烷基型机制进行异裂或由外晶格氧原子氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子实现。通过碳正离子机制的活化比烷基机制更热力学和动力学上有利。GaO+离子的再生非常困难，还原比再生更受青睐。多个催化循环可以在这些离子上发生，但这些位点不是氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石稳定催化活性的主要来源。
