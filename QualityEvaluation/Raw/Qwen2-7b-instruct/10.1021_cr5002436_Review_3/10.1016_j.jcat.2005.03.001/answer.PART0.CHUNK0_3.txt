[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity [1,2]."
[2] "Since carbon diox- ide is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of carbon dioxide is attractive not only economically but also ecologically."
[3] "The olefin yield is greatly increased in the presence of CO2."
[4] "Gallium oxide catalysts after reaction for 6 h in the presence of CO2 were studied by means of XRD, TGA,and N2 adsorption methods."
[5] "The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."
[6] "The β-Ga2O3 catalyst was pretreated either in N2 or in H2 at 500 C for 1 h before reaction."
[7] "Meanwhile, the selectivity for propene on the catalyst pretreated in H2 is slightly lower than that on the catalyst pretreated in N2 during the whole course of reaction."
[8] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3."
[9] "The low basicity and, consequently, the weak adsorption of CO2 are probably correlated with the low conversion of CO2."
[10] "TPR and XPS results show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."

1. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant in partial oxidation reactions like reforming and oxidative coupling of methane is economically and ecologically favorable. It also shows high propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

2. Carbon dioxide contributes to increasing olefin yields in catalytic processes.

3. XRD, TGA, and N2 adsorption methods were used to study the changes in gallium oxide catalysts after reacting with CO2 for 6 hours.

4. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 leads to a lesser amount of coke deposition on the catalyst.

5. The β-Ga2O3 catalyst was pretreated with either N2 or H2 at 500°C for 1 hour prior to reaction.

6. The catalyst pretreated with H2 exhibits a slightly lower propene selectivity throughout the reaction compared to the one treated with N2.

7. The coke deposit amount and specific surface areas of the catalysts after the reaction are documented in Table 3.

8. Low CO2 conversion is likely linked to the low basicity of the gallium oxide catalysts.

9. About 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C, but this part cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration.

1. 在重整和甲烷氧化耦合等部分氧化反应中，使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂是经济和生态上具有吸引力的。它在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中也表现出高丙烯选择性。

2. 二氧化碳有助于提高催化过程中的烯烃产率。

3. 使用XRD、TGA和N2吸附方法研究了在与二氧化碳反应6小时后镓氧化物催化剂的变化。

4. β-Ga2O3的低表面积导致催化剂上的焦炭沉积较少。

5. β-Ga2O3催化剂在500°C下用N2或H2预处理1小时后再进行反应。

6. 用H2预处理的催化剂在整个反应过程中显示的丙烯选择性略低于用N2预处理的催化剂。

7. 表3记录了催化剂反应后的焦炭沉积量和特定表面面积。

8. 低CO2转化可能与镓氧化物催化剂的低碱度有关。

9. 大约有15 mol%的新镓氧化物催化剂可以在500°C以下被还原，但这部分还原的氧化物在反应和氧气再生后无法恢复。
