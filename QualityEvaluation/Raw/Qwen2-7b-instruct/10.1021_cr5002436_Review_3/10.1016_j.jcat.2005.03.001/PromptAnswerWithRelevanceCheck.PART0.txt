Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence or absence of CO2 over four polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated. β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2. 

H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C. The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction. 

The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide. Furthermore, increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. These factors influence the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert paraffins into olefins while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the reaction environment can significantly enhance the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide-based catalysts. This is primarily due to the promotion of the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction, which facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, the conjugated effect of protons and oxide surfaces in the presence of CO2 can accelerate the reaction kinetics, leading to higher yields of olefins.

The β-Ga2O3 polymorph of gallium oxide stands out as one of the most active catalysts for dehydrogenating propane to propene, especially when CO2 is present. The high surface area and the abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites, related to coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxide, contribute to its superior catalytic performance. These acid sites are likely responsible for the enhanced reaction rates and selectivities observed in β-Ga2O3.

Temperature variations impact the dehydrogenation process, with higher temperatures generally increasing the conversion of propane to propene. However, the selectivity towards propene decreases with increased temperature. The presence of CO2 tends to reduce the selectivity further, indicating a trade-off between conversion and product purity at elevated temperatures.

Pretreatment of the β-Ga2O3 catalyst in nitrogen (N2) or hydrogen (H2) before the reaction can affect its performance. Treatment in H2 leads to a slight decrease in initial propane conversion but improves the catalyst's stability, resulting in a propane conversion that becomes comparable to that of the N2-treated catalyst after 6 hours of reaction. This suggests that hydrogen pretreatment might help in preserving the catalyst's activity over longer reaction times.

The reducibility of the gallium oxide catalysts under hydrogen (H2) exposure is limited, with only about 15 mol% of the fresh catalysts being reduced below 500°C. Importantly, this reduced oxide component does not recover after oxygen (O2) regeneration, indicating a potential role in the initial stages of the reaction that could influence its efficiency. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation and understand its implications on the catalytic mechanism.

In summary, the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has led to advancements in catalyst design and optimization. The use of CO2 as an oxidant has been shown to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly impact the catalyst's performance. The conjugated effect of protons and oxide surfaces, along with the presence of specific acid sites, play key roles in the enhanced catalytic activity observed in β-Ga2O3 and other gallium oxide polymorphs.

对范德蒙氧化物基催化剂作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索，主要受到成本效益和环境友好性驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于提高催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对于确定这些催化剂中范德蒙物种的性质和行为至关重要。这些因素影响着催化剂高效转化烷烃为烯烃的能力，同时最小化不希望的副反应。

二氧化碳(CO2)在反应环境中的存在能显著增强范德蒙氧化物基催化剂的催化活性。这主要是由于促进了水气逆向转移反应和布杜奥反应，从而加速了脱氢过程。此外，在CO2存在下，氧化物表面与质子的共轭效应可以加快反应动力学，导致更高的烯烃产率。

β-Ga2O3镓氧化物的多晶形态是脱氢丙烷为丙烯最活跃的催化剂之一，尤其是在CO2存在的条件下。高表面面积和表面中等强度酸位的存在，与配位不饱和Ga3+离子以及氧化物的共轭效应有关，共同促成了其优越的催化性能。这些酸位可能是观察到β-Ga2O3中反应速率和选择性提升的原因。

温度变化对脱氢过程有影响，较高的温度通常会增加丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率。然而，丙烯的选择性随温度升高而降低。CO2的存在倾向于进一步降低选择性，表明在较高温度下存在转换与产物纯度之间的权衡。

在反应前对β-Ga2O3催化剂进行氮(N2)或氢(H2)预处理可以影响其性能。在H2预处理后，初始丙烷转化率略有下降，但催化剂稳定性得到改善，6小时反应后，丙烷转化率与N2预处理的催化剂相当。这表明氢预处理可能有助于保持催化剂的活性更长时间。

镓氧化物催化剂在氢(H2)暴露下的可还原性有限，只有大约15摩尔%的原始催化剂能够在低于500°C的条件下被还原。重要的是，这种还原的氧化物成分在氧气(O2)再生后不能恢复，暗示其在反应初期可能在效率上发挥作用。需要进一步的研究来确认这一观察结果及其对催化机制的影响。

总之，对范德蒙氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索已经推动了催化剂设计和优化的发展。使用CO2作为氧化剂已经显示出增强这些催化剂的活性和稳定性的潜力。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对催化剂性能产生显著影响。质子和氧化物表面的共轭效应，以及特定酸位的存在，在观察到的β-Ga2O3和其他镓氧化物多晶形态中的增强催化活性中扮演关键角色。

Journal of Catalysis 232 (2005) 143151 www.elsevier.com/locate/jcat Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide

The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.

Gallium oxide has five polymorphs, designated α-, β-, γ -, δ-, and ε-Ga2O3. Of these, β-Ga2O3 is the stable form. All of these phases of gallium oxide except ε-Ga2O3 can be prepared under specific conditions. In this work, the four polymorphs of gallium oxide (α-,β-, γ -, δ-Ga2O3) were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption at 196 C, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopy. The catalytic performance of these polymorphs for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence or absence of CO2 was compared and discussed in relation to their physicochemical properties and the mechanism of the reaction.

The dehydrogenation of propane was run over the gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 500 C; the reaction data are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. CO was detected in the reaction product. Again, the gallium oxides behave differently in the reaction. For all of the catalysts the initial conversion of propane is reduced in the presence of CO2, but the catalysts are more stable with respect to reaction time. The propane conversions of the catalysts at steady state in the presence of CO2 are only slightly lower than those in the absence of CO2, and the activity order of the gallium oxides is unchanged. β-Ga2O3 remains intrinsically two to three times more active than the other types of gallium oxide. In the meantime, the selectivity for propene is also improved on β-Ga2O3 in the presence of CO2. It can be as high as 97.6% at steady state. Moreover, in comparison with chromium oxide, β-Ga2O3 is more active for the reaction in the presence of CO2. Its specific activity is almost twice as great as that of chromium oxide.

The gallium oxide catalysts after reaction for 6 h in the presence of CO2 were studied by means of XRD, TGA, and N2 adsorption methods. Fig. 4 illustrates the XRD patterns of the used catalysts, which are similar to those of the fresh catalysts, confirming the absence of structural change of the oxides during reaction. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3.

The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited. In the absence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on β-Ga2O3 is obviously increased, and the reduction in surface area after reaction is more evident.

The β-Ga2O3 catalyst was pretreated either in N2 or in H2 at 500 C for 1 h before reaction. The effect of the pretreatment atmosphere on the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 was studied; the results are shown in Fig. 6. The initial propane conversion is decreased from 23.3 to 13.6% after H2 pretreatment, but the catalyst becomes more stable. After 6 h of reaction, the propane conversion on the catalyst pretreated in H2 becomes the same as that on the catalyst pretreated in N2. In the meantime, the selectivity for propene on the catalyst pretreated in H2 is slightly lower than that on the catalyst pretreated in N2 during the whole course of reaction.

A regeneration treatment of the β-Ga2O3 catalyst after 6 h of reaction at 500 C in the presence of CO2 was attempted. As shown in Fig. 7, the propane conversion on β-Ga2O3 catalyst decreases from 23.3 to 10.8% after 6 h on stream. The reaction was interrupted under a N2 stream, and then O2 was introduced at 500 C for 1 h to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst. The propane conversion on the regenerated catalyst is 17.0%, which is much lower than the initial conversion, showing that the original activity of the catalyst could not be fully restored. Meanwhile, after the second and third regeneration, the activity of the catalyst is almost fully recovered. The increase in the activity after regeneration is due to the removal of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst, and the reduction in the activity after the first regeneration could be due to the loss of some temporary active sites on the fresh catalyst.

Among the gallium oxides, β-Ga2O3 is the most stable one, and it can exist above 500 C; so the effect of reaction temperature on dehydrogenation of propane over β-Ga2O3 in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied. The reaction results are given in Fig. 5. At 500 C, the initial conversion of propane in the presence of CO2 is lower. However, it increases more steeply with temperature, so above 550 C it starts to surpass the initial conversion of propane in the absence of CO2, implying that the activation of CO2 is favored at higher reaction temperatures. In both cases, the selectivity for propene is reduced as the reaction temperature is increased, but the reduction is more significant in the presence of CO2.

The above measurements indicate that the gallium oxides are principally acidic oxides with medium acid strength. Only a negligible amount of basic sites exists on the oxides, implying that the acidic sites may play a more important role in the competition among the gallium oxides.

The reducibility of the four polymorphs of gallium oxide was studied by H2-TPR; the results are shown in Fig. 9 and Table 6. Small reduction peaks appear in the TPR profiles of all of the samples above 200 C, indicating that small parts of the gallium oxides can be reduced by H2 at rather low temperature. Comparing our experimental conditions with those in the literature, it could be postulated that the omission of the reduction peak in the literature is caused by the low BET surface area (2.90 m2/g) of the β-Ga2O3 used or the low concentration of gallium oxide (1.7 mol%) on the supported catalyst. Nevertheless, the amount of gallium oxide reduced by H2 according to the TPR data is limited for all of the samples. After reduction, the amount of low-valence gallium oxide in the sample is only about 15 mol%.

It is more interesting to note that the O2-regenerated β-Ga2O3 catalyst, after 6 h of reaction in the presence of CO2, is not reduced by H2 in TPR measurements, indicating that the part of the reducible gallium oxide species in the catalyst is not restored after regeneration.

To confirm the valence change of gallium after reduction by H2, the XPS spectra for β-Ga2O3 were recorded before and after reduction. The deconvoluted spectra in the Ga (3d) region appear in Fig. 10. Only two peaks appear in the spectrum of β-Ga2O3 at 25.0 and 20.8 eV, respectively, which can be assigned to O(2s) and Ga3+(3d) bands, according to the literature. A new small peak appears in the spectrum of β-Ga2O3 at 19.6 eV after reduction by H2 at 500 C for 1 h. This shift in binding energy (1.2 eV) can be attributed to the presence of Ga2+O species in the reduced sample. From the ratio of the area of peak C to the total peak area, the amount of Ga3+ reduced to Ga+ can be calculated. The calculated value shows that about 2.5 mol% of Ga2O3 is reduced, that is, 0.05 mol H2 per mol of Ga2O3 is consumed during reduction. This result is in accord with the H2-TPR data in Table 6.

The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism. However, gallium oxide is hardly reduced and the redox cycle is irreversible under the reaction temperature according to the experimental results in this work, so the redox mechanism is probably inapplicable for the reaction.

Previous studies have shown that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, leading to the formation of Hand H+ ions. Hence it has also been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. The alkoxides would decompose further to form the dehydrogenation products. Based on the analogy of gallium oxide to aluminum oxide, these acid sites should be the Lewis acid sites formed via abstraction of OH groups from gallium cations in tetrahedral positions. It is known that tetrahedral Ga ions exist in the structure of β- and γ -Ga2O3, and surely they are the source of the Lewis acidity. By contrast, α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted only by octahedral Ga3+, and theoretically the formation of Lewis acid sites on these oxides is unlikely. However, the results show that the surface acidities of γ -, α-, and δ-Ga2O3 are similar when normalized to unit surface area. These unexpected phenomena were interpreted as the occurrence of some surface reconstruction in α-Ga2O3, giving rise to tetrahedral GaIV species from bulk octahedral GaVI, because there is a high preference for tetrahedral versus octahedral coordination in the presence of d10 Ga3+ cations due to an enhanced polarizing power. The small peak around 180 ppm in the 71Ga NMR spectrum of α-Ga2O3 confirms that a small number of tetrahedral GaIV ions are present in our α-Ga2O3 sample. More importantly, these GaIV ions formed by surface reconstruction are situated on the surface of the sample, and they are all accessible to the reactant and probe molecules.

As regards the promoting effect of CO2, the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in the presence of CO2. The CO in the reaction products is associated with these reactions.

In summary, the dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, in both the presence and absence of CO2. It is even more active than chromium oxide in the presence of CO2. H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C, and the reduced gallium oxide is not restored after O2 regeneration. Thus, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 occurs on gallium oxide, probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism. The reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in the presence of CO2. NH3-TPD measurement shows that the surface acid site density of β-Ga2O3 is the highest among all of the polymorphs, which facilitates the conjugated effect of protons and oxide and promotes the reaction. 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopic studies suggest that the surface acidity of the gallium oxides is related to the presence of tetracooordinated GaIV ions.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has gained momentum due to the rising demand for alkenes. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements focusing on carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to optimize vanadium species' nature and behavior in these catalysts.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of vanadium species, impacting the accessibility and reactivity of these species. A larger surface area provides more sites for vanadium species to interact with reactants, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium in the catalyst, which is crucial for achieving the optimal balance between activity and stability.

Research has also shown that the choice of support material can alter the electronic properties of vanadium species, affecting their reactivity. Supports with high surface areas and good thermal stability, such as metal oxides or carbides, are commonly used. These supports can stabilize vanadium species, preventing them from aggregating or being leached out during the reaction, thus maintaining the catalyst's efficiency.

The behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by the interaction with the support surface. For instance, vanadium can form various complexes with the support, such as V-O bonds or coordination complexes, which can affect its redox properties and the ability to catalyze dehydrogenation reactions. The type of support material and its surface chemistry play a critical role in determining the stability and reactivity of vanadium species.

Moreover, the optimization of metal loading is essential for achieving the desired catalytic performance. Too low a loading may result in insufficient active sites, while too high a loading can lead to aggregation of vanadium species, reducing the surface area available for reactions and potentially causing poisoning effects due to the formation of inert compounds.

In summary, the selection and modification of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading are key factors in controlling the nature and behavior of vanadium species in catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. These parameters influence the dispersion, stability, and reactivity of vanadium species, ultimately affecting the overall catalytic performance and efficiency of the catalysts. The optimization of these variables is crucial for developing more efficient and sustainable catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

此外，范德华物种在催化剂中的行为受到支撑表面的相互作用的影响。例如，范德华物种可以与支撑形成各种复合物，如V-O键或配合物，这可能会影响它们的还原性及其催化脱氢反应的能力。支撑材料的种类及其表面化学特性对于确定范德华物种的稳定性和反应性至关重要。

此外，金属负载的优化对于实现所需催化性能至关重要。负载过低可能导致活性位点不足，而负载过高可能导致范德华物种聚集，减少可用于反应的表面积，并可能因形成惰性化合物而导致中毒效应。

总之，选择和修改载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载量是控制催化剂中范德华物种性质的关键因素。这些参数影响范德华物种的分散性、稳定性和反应性，最终影响催化剂的整体催化性能和效率。优化这些变量对于开发更高效、更可持续的脱氢催化剂至关重要。
