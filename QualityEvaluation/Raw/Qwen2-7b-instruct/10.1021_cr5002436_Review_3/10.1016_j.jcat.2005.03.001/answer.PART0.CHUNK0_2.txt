The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. These factors influence the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert paraffins into olefins while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the reaction environment can significantly enhance the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide-based catalysts. This is primarily due to the promotion of the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction, which facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Additionally, the conjugated effect of protons and oxide surfaces in the presence of CO2 can accelerate the reaction kinetics, leading to higher yields of olefins.

The β-Ga2O3 polymorph of gallium oxide stands out as one of the most active catalysts for dehydrogenating propane to propene, especially when CO2 is present. The high surface area and the abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites, related to coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxide, contribute to its superior catalytic performance. These acid sites are likely responsible for the enhanced reaction rates and selectivities observed in β-Ga2O3.

Temperature variations impact the dehydrogenation process, with higher temperatures generally increasing the conversion of propane to propene. However, the selectivity towards propene decreases with increased temperature. The presence of CO2 tends to reduce the selectivity further, indicating a trade-off between conversion and product purity at elevated temperatures.

Pretreatment of the β-Ga2O3 catalyst in nitrogen (N2) or hydrogen (H2) before the reaction can affect its performance. Treatment in H2 leads to a slight decrease in initial propane conversion but improves the catalyst's stability, resulting in a propane conversion that becomes comparable to that of the N2-treated catalyst after 6 hours of reaction. This suggests that hydrogen pretreatment might help in preserving the catalyst's activity over longer reaction times.

The reducibility of the gallium oxide catalysts under hydrogen (H2) exposure is limited, with only about 15 mol% of the fresh catalysts being reduced below 500°C. Importantly, this reduced oxide component does not recover after oxygen (O2) regeneration, indicating a potential role in the initial stages of the reaction that could influence its efficiency. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation and understand its implications on the catalytic mechanism.

In summary, the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has led to advancements in catalyst design and optimization. The use of CO2 as an oxidant has been shown to enhance the catalytic activity and stability of these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly impact the catalyst's performance. The conjugated effect of protons and oxide surfaces, along with the presence of specific acid sites, play key roles in the enhanced catalytic activity observed in β-Ga2O3 and other gallium oxide polymorphs.

对范德蒙氧化物基催化剂作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索，主要受到成本效益和环境友好性驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点在于提高催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对于确定这些催化剂中范德蒙物种的性质和行为至关重要。这些因素影响着催化剂高效转化烷烃为烯烃的能力，同时最小化不希望的副反应。

二氧化碳(CO2)在反应环境中的存在能显著增强范德蒙氧化物基催化剂的催化活性。这主要是由于促进了水气逆向转移反应和布杜奥反应，从而加速了脱氢过程。此外，在CO2存在下，氧化物表面与质子的共轭效应可以加快反应动力学，导致更高的烯烃产率。

β-Ga2O3镓氧化物的多晶形态是脱氢丙烷为丙烯最活跃的催化剂之一，尤其是在CO2存在的条件下。高表面面积和表面中等强度酸位的存在，与配位不饱和Ga3+离子以及氧化物的共轭效应有关，共同促成了其优越的催化性能。这些酸位可能是观察到β-Ga2O3中反应速率和选择性提升的原因。

温度变化对脱氢过程有影响，较高的温度通常会增加丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率。然而，丙烯的选择性随温度升高而降低。CO2的存在倾向于进一步降低选择性，表明在较高温度下存在转换与产物纯度之间的权衡。

在反应前对β-Ga2O3催化剂进行氮(N2)或氢(H2)预处理可以影响其性能。在H2预处理后，初始丙烷转化率略有下降，但催化剂稳定性得到改善，6小时反应后，丙烷转化率与N2预处理的催化剂相当。这表明氢预处理可能有助于保持催化剂的活性更长时间。

镓氧化物催化剂在氢(H2)暴露下的可还原性有限，只有大约15摩尔%的原始催化剂能够在低于500°C的条件下被还原。重要的是，这种还原的氧化物成分在氧气(O2)再生后不能恢复，暗示其在反应初期可能在效率上发挥作用。需要进一步的研究来确认这一观察结果及其对催化机制的影响。

总之，对范德蒙氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索已经推动了催化剂设计和优化的发展。使用CO2作为氧化剂已经显示出增强这些催化剂的活性和稳定性的潜力。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对催化剂性能产生显著影响。质子和氧化物表面的共轭效应，以及特定酸位的存在，在观察到的β-Ga2O3和其他镓氧化物多晶形态中的增强催化活性中扮演关键角色。
