1. Carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, including the reforming of methane and the oxidative coupling of methane. It has been reported to provide a high selectivity for propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 

2. The utilization of carbon dioxide as an oxidant is attractive not only economically but also environmentally, due to its status as a major greenhouse gas.

3. The properties of gallium oxide catalysts after reacting with carbon dioxide for 6 hours were analyzed using XRD, TGA, and N2 adsorption techniques.

4. The effectiveness of carbon dioxide in enhancing the catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.

1. 近年来，二氧化碳被用作重整和甲烷氧化耦合等部分氧化反应的氧化剂。在丙烷的二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中，已经报告了较高的丙烯选择性。

2. 使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂不仅在经济上具有吸引力，而且在环境方面也具有吸引力，因为它是主要的温室气体之一。

3. 在存在二氧化碳的情况下，对反应6小时后的镓氧化物催化剂进行了XRD、TGA和N2吸附方法的分析。

4. 二氧化碳增强β-Ga2O3催化活性的效果在550°C以上的温度下更为明显。
