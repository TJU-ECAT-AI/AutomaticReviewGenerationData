The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.

Gallium oxide has five polymorphs, designated α-, β-, γ -, δ-, and ε-Ga2O3. Of these, β-Ga2O3 is the stable form. All of these phases of gallium oxide except ε-Ga2O3 can be prepared under specific conditions. In this work, the four polymorphs of gallium oxide (α-,β-, γ -, δ-Ga2O3) were prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption at 196 C, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopy. The catalytic performance of these polymorphs for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence or absence of CO2 was compared and discussed in relation to their physicochemical properties and the mechanism of the reaction.

The dehydrogenation of propane was run over the gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 500 C; the reaction data are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. CO was detected in the reaction product. Again, the gallium oxides behave differently in the reaction. For all of the catalysts the initial conversion of propane is reduced in the presence of CO2, but the catalysts are more stable with respect to reaction time. The propane conversions of the catalysts at steady state in the presence of CO2 are only slightly lower than those in the absence of CO2, and the activity order of the gallium oxides is unchanged. β-Ga2O3 remains intrinsically two to three times more active than the other types of gallium oxide. In the meantime, the selectivity for propene is also improved on β-Ga2O3 in the presence of CO2. It can be as high as 97.6% at steady state. Moreover, in comparison with chromium oxide, β-Ga2O3 is more active for the reaction in the presence of CO2. Its specific activity is almost twice as great as that of chromium oxide.

The gallium oxide catalysts after reaction for 6 h in the presence of CO2 were studied by means of XRD, TGA, and N2 adsorption methods. Fig. 4 illustrates the XRD patterns of the used catalysts, which are similar to those of the fresh catalysts, confirming the absence of structural change of the oxides during reaction. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3.

The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited. In the absence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on β-Ga2O3 is obviously increased, and the reduction in surface area after reaction is more evident.

The β-Ga2O3 catalyst was pretreated either in N2 or in H2 at 500 C for 1 h before reaction. The effect of the pretreatment atmosphere on the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 was studied; the results are shown in Fig. 6. The initial propane conversion is decreased from 23.3 to 13.6% after H2 pretreatment, but the catalyst becomes more stable. After 6 h of reaction, the propane conversion on the catalyst pretreated in H2 becomes the same as that on the catalyst pretreated in N2. In the meantime, the selectivity for propene on the catalyst pretreated in H2 is slightly lower than that on the catalyst pretreated in N2 during the whole course of reaction.

A regeneration treatment of the β-Ga2O3 catalyst after 6 h of reaction at 500 C in the presence of CO2 was attempted. As shown in Fig. 7, the propane conversion on β-Ga2O3 catalyst decreases from 23.3 to 10.8% after 6 h on stream. The reaction was interrupted under a N2 stream, and then O2 was introduced at 500 C for 1 h to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst. The propane conversion on the regenerated catalyst is 17.0%, which is much lower than the initial conversion, showing that the original activity of the catalyst could not be fully restored. Meanwhile, after the second and third regeneration, the activity of the catalyst is almost fully recovered. The increase in the activity after regeneration is due to the removal of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst, and the reduction in the activity after the first regeneration could be due to the loss of some temporary active sites on the fresh catalyst.

Among the gallium oxides, β-Ga2O3 is the most stable one, and it can exist above 500 C; so the effect of reaction temperature on dehydrogenation of propane over β-Ga2O3 in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied. The reaction results are given in Fig. 5. At 500 C, the initial conversion of propane in the presence of CO2 is lower. However, it increases more steeply with temperature, so above 550 C it starts to surpass the initial conversion of propane in the absence of CO2, implying that the activation of CO2 is favored at higher reaction temperatures. In both cases, the selectivity for propene is reduced as the reaction temperature is increased, but the reduction is more significant in the presence of CO2.

The above measurements indicate that the gallium oxides are principally acidic oxides with medium acid strength. Only a negligible amount of basic sites exists on the oxides, implying that the acidic sites may play a more important role in the competition among the gallium oxides.

The reducibility of the four polymorphs of gallium oxide was studied by H2-TPR; the results are shown in Fig. 9 and Table 6. Small reduction peaks appear in the TPR profiles of all of the samples above 200 C, indicating that small parts of the gallium oxides can be reduced by H2 at rather low temperature. Comparing our experimental conditions with those in the literature, it could be postulated that the omission of the reduction peak in the literature is caused by the low BET surface area (2.90 m2/g) of the β-Ga2O3 used or the low concentration of gallium oxide (1.7 mol%) on the supported catalyst. Nevertheless, the amount of gallium oxide reduced by H2 according to the TPR data is limited for all of the samples. After reduction, the amount of low-valence gallium oxide in the sample is only about 15 mol%.

It is more interesting to note that the O2-regenerated β-Ga2O3 catalyst, after 6 h of reaction in the presence of CO2, is not reduced by H2 in TPR measurements, indicating that the part of the reducible gallium oxide species in the catalyst is not restored after regeneration.

To confirm the valence change of gallium after reduction by H2, the XPS spectra for β-Ga2O3 were recorded before and after reduction. The deconvoluted spectra in the Ga (3d) region appear in Fig. 10. Only two peaks appear in the spectrum of β-Ga2O3 at 25.0 and 20.8 eV, respectively, which can be assigned to O(2s) and Ga3+(3d) bands, according to the literature. A new small peak appears in the spectrum of β-Ga2O3 at 19.6 eV after reduction by H2 at 500 C for 1 h. This shift in binding energy (1.2 eV) can be attributed to the presence of Ga2+O species in the reduced sample. From the ratio of the area of peak C to the total peak area, the amount of Ga3+ reduced to Ga+ can be calculated. The calculated value shows that about 2.5 mol% of Ga2O3 is reduced, that is, 0.05 mol H2 per mol of Ga2O3 is consumed during reduction. This result is in accord with the H2-TPR data in Table 6.

The dehydrogenation of propane or ethane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism. However, gallium oxide is hardly reduced and the redox cycle is irreversible under the reaction temperature according to the experimental results in this work, so the redox mechanism is probably inapplicable for the reaction.

Previous studies have shown that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide, leading to the formation of Hand H+ ions. Hence it has also been suggested that propane can heterolytically dissociate on gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species. The alkoxides would decompose further to form the dehydrogenation products. Based on the analogy of gallium oxide to aluminum oxide, these acid sites should be the Lewis acid sites formed via abstraction of OH groups from gallium cations in tetrahedral positions. It is known that tetrahedral Ga ions exist in the structure of β- and γ -Ga2O3, and surely they are the source of the Lewis acidity. By contrast, α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted only by octahedral Ga3+, and theoretically the formation of Lewis acid sites on these oxides is unlikely. However, the results show that the surface acidities of γ -, α-, and δ-Ga2O3 are similar when normalized to unit surface area. These unexpected phenomena were interpreted as the occurrence of some surface reconstruction in α-Ga2O3, giving rise to tetrahedral GaIV species from bulk octahedral GaVI, because there is a high preference for tetrahedral versus octahedral coordination in the presence of d10 Ga3+ cations due to an enhanced polarizing power. The small peak around 180 ppm in the 71Ga NMR spectrum of α-Ga2O3 confirms that a small number of tetrahedral GaIV ions are present in our α-Ga2O3 sample. More importantly, these GaIV ions formed by surface reconstruction are situated on the surface of the sample, and they are all accessible to the reactant and probe molecules.

As regards the promoting effect of CO2, the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in the presence of CO2. The CO in the reaction products is associated with these reactions.

In summary, the dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, in both the presence and absence of CO2. It is even more active than chromium oxide in the presence of CO2. H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C, and the reduced gallium oxide is not restored after O2 regeneration. Thus, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 occurs on gallium oxide, probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism. The reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 account for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in the presence of CO2. NH3-TPD measurement shows that the surface acid site density of β-Ga2O3 is the highest among all of the polymorphs, which facilitates the conjugated effect of protons and oxide and promotes the reaction. 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopic studies suggest that the surface acidity of the gallium oxides is related to the presence of tetracooordinated GaIV ions.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has gained momentum due to the rising demand for alkenes. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements focusing on carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to optimize vanadium species' nature and behavior in these catalysts.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of vanadium species, impacting the accessibility and reactivity of these species. A larger surface area provides more sites for vanadium species to interact with reactants, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium in the catalyst, which is crucial for achieving the optimal balance between activity and stability.

Research has also shown that the choice of support material can alter the electronic properties of vanadium species, affecting their reactivity. Supports with high surface areas and good thermal stability, such as metal oxides or carbides, are commonly used. These supports can stabilize vanadium species, preventing them from aggregating or being leached out during the reaction, thus maintaining the catalyst's efficiency.

The behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by the interaction with the support surface. For instance, vanadium can form various complexes with the support, such as V-O bonds or coordination complexes, which can affect its redox properties and the ability to catalyze dehydrogenation reactions. The type of support material and its surface chemistry play a critical role in determining the stability and reactivity of vanadium species.

Moreover, the optimization of metal loading is essential for achieving the desired catalytic performance. Too low a loading may result in insufficient active sites, while too high a loading can lead to aggregation of vanadium species, reducing the surface area available for reactions and potentially causing poisoning effects due to the formation of inert compounds.

In summary, the selection and modification of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading are key factors in controlling the nature and behavior of vanadium species in catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. These parameters influence the dispersion, stability, and reactivity of vanadium species, ultimately affecting the overall catalytic performance and efficiency of the catalysts. The optimization of these variables is crucial for developing more efficient and sustainable catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation processes.
