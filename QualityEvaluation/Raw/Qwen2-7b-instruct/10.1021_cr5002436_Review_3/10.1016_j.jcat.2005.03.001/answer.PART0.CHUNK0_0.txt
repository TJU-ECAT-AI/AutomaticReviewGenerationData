Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence or absence of CO2 over four polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated. β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2. 

H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C. The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction. 

The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 is probably associated with an abundance of surface medium-strong acid sites related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide. Furthermore, increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C.

Answer: The high catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 in dehydrogenating propane to propene is associated with its ability to generate abundant surface medium-strong acid sites. These sites are related to the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of protons and oxide. Increasing the reaction temperature aids in activating CO2 over β-Ga2O3, enhancing the catalyst's performance. The promoting effect of CO2 is more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.

高活性β-Ga2O3在丙烷脱氢为丙烯中的催化活性与表面产生大量中强酸性位点有关。这些位点与Ga3+离子的配位不饱和状态以及质子和氧化物的共轭效应相关。提高反应温度有助于激活CO2，增强β-Ga2O3催化剂的性能。CO2的促进作用在550°C以上更为明显。
