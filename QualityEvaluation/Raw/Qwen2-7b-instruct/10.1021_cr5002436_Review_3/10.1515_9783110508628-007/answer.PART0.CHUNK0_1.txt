Jahrbcher f. Nationalkonomie u. Statistik (Lucius & Lucius, Stuttgart 2012) Bd. (Vol.) 232/6 Diskussionsbeitrag / Discussion Paper FIRE for the Euro: A Superior Way to Bond Market Stabilization Friedrich Heinemann* ZEW Mannheim

Introduction: "More than two years after the outbreak of the confidence crisis in euro government bond markets the situation remains fragile."

Summary: "This contribution proposes fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) as an alternative."

Principles: "The FIRE concept is based on the insight that the bad equilibrium in Euro government bond markets creates winners and losers."

Advantages: "FIRE does not involve any guarantees on the side of the giving countries."

Quantifications: "A simulation based on the market conditions in May 2012 indicates the equalization amounts which may be associated with its implementation."

Conclusion: "Europe has established numerous important institutions such as new fiscal rules or liquidity facilities in its fight against the debt crisis."
