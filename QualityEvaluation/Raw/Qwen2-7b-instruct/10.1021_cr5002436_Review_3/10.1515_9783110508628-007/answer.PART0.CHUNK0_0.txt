[1] "The confidence crisis has immediate destructive consequences: Crisis countries are faced with a sudden rise of refinancing costs which put a large additional burden on their reform and consolidation task."

[2] "This contribution proposes a third option which has so far been overlooked. This third option is the establishment of a fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) scheme and is developed in detail in the following."

[3] "The FIRE concept is based on the insight that the bad equilibrium in Euro government bond markets creates winners and losers."

[4] "FIRE does not involve any guarantees on the side of the giving countries. The sup- port would be achieved through a transparent fiscal instrument and would not cre- ate any hardly predictable contingent liabilities."

[5] "One criticism of the FIRE concept could be that it might be less credible in the eyes of markets compared to full scale joint and several guarantees or ECB bond pur- chases. This might be true but this seeming disadvantage is an additional strength."

[6] "Euro area countries should establish a mutual FIRE fund based on a FIRE Treaty. The Treaty's contents could be limited to the decision procedure and a fundamental agree- ment on euro zone countries' readiness to equalize interest rate differentials in situations of market panics."

[7] "A simulation based on the market conditions in May 2012 indicates the equalization amounts which may be associated with its implementation."

[8] "Given the May 2012 market conditions, these countries are: Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Austria."

[9] "The amount of 5.7 bn. EUR for the cost of the FIRE scheme refers to the annual interest rate subsidy for both countries' total emissions in 2012."
