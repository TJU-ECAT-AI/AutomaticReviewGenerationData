<quotes>

[1] "The confidence crisis has immediate destructive consequences: Crisis countries are faced with a sudden rise of refinancing costs which put a large additional burden on their reform and consolidation task."

[2] "This contribution proposes a third option which has so far been overlooked. This third option is the establishment of a fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) scheme and is developed in detail in the following."

[3] "The FIRE concept is based on the insight that the bad equilibrium in Euro government bond markets creates winners and losers."

[4] "FIRE does not involve any guarantees on the side of the giving countries. The sup- port would be achieved through a transparent fiscal instrument and would not cre- ate any hardly predictable contingent liabilities."

[5] "One criticism of the FIRE concept could be that it might be less credible in the eyes of markets compared to full scale joint and several guarantees or ECB bond pur- chases. This might be true but this seeming disadvantage is an additional strength."

[6] "Euro area countries should establish a mutual FIRE fund based on a FIRE Treaty. The Treaty's contents could be limited to the decision procedure and a fundamental agree- ment on euro zone countries' readiness to equalize interest rate differentials in situations of market panics."

[7] "A simulation based on the market conditions in May 2012 indicates the equalization amounts which may be associated with its implementation."

[8] "Given the May 2012 market conditions, these countries are: Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Austria."

[9] "The amount of 5.7 bn. EUR for the cost of the FIRE scheme refers to the annual interest rate subsidy for both countries' total emissions in 2012."

1. The confidence crisis in euro government bond markets has immediate destructive consequences, as crisis countries are faced with a sudden rise in refinancing costs, significantly burdening their reform and consolidation tasks.

2. The document proposes the establishment of a fiscal interest rate equalization (FIRE) scheme as a third solution, which has not been widely considered before. 

3. The FIRE concept stems from the understanding that the imbalance in Euro government bond markets results in winners and losers.

4. FIRE supports countries without involving any guarantees, ensuring transparency and predictable liabilities.

5. Despite potential credibility issues, these are viewed as an advantage since it requires countries to be capable of long-term reforms for the scheme to be effective.

6. To implement the FIRE scheme, euro area countries should establish a mutual fund under a FIRE Treaty, focusing on decision procedures and readiness to equalize interest rates.

7. A simulation was conducted based on market conditions in May 2012 to estimate the equalization amounts associated with the implementation of the FIRE program.

8. According to the May 2012 market conditions, Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Austria would contribute to the program's financing.

9. The cost of the FIRE scheme, estimated at 5.7 billion euros, refers to the annual interest rate subsidy for the total emissions of both countries in 2012.

[1] "The confidence crisis in euro government bond markets can make reasonable attempts futile."
[2] "Self-fulfilling panics in euro government bond markets can undermine the effectiveness of efforts to stabilize the market."
[3] "FIRE's stabilizing function requires that the subsidy received, sr, be large enough to ensure benefitting countries regain a sustainable long-run financing situation given a consequential reform and consolidation path."
[4] "FIRE allows a credible conditionality which links the continuing flow of interest rate subsidies to ongoing structural and fiscal reforms on the side of the benefitting countries."
[5] "FIRE can also be helpful in a later stage of the crisis, serving as a bridge into the market and speeding up the return to the market."
[6] "In order to safeguard FIRE's credible availability, provisions should clarify that a veto of single countries would not prevent other countries from participating in the FIRE scheme."
[7] "The EUR-13 debt weighted average (which excludes the three program countries and which is the relevant group for a mutual FIRE fund) trades at an average of 3.8 percentage points in the period between January 2008 and May 2012."
[8] "Assuming an average maturity of five years, the discounted value for the subsidies over the full maturity of one year's new emissions would add up to approximately 27.5 bn. EUR."
[9] "This result reflects the fact that these three countries benefit most from the safe haven-effect."
