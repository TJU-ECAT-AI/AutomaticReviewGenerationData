1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to produce olefins, which are crucial components in synthetic rubbers, plastics, automotive fuel components, and other valuable chemical products. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on modifying the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts through the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed vanadium species.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of vanadium species, while support surface area influences the accessibility of reactants to these species. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium species, impacting their reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Research has revealed that vanadium oxide can exist in various forms, including isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. The structure of these species changes upon exposure to water vapor, and the vanadium density varies depending on the metal loading.

4. Lower metal loadings result in the predominance of isolated vanadates, which then condense into polyvanadates and eventually bulk V2O5 crystallites as the loading increases. This change in structure impacts the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The BET surface area decreases with higher metal loadings due to the blockage of pores by vanadium oxide species. This phenomenon affects the catalyst's efficiency in dehydrogenation processes.

6. XRD patterns confirm that the vanadium oxide species is well dispersed on the surface of the support for lower metal loadings, while the XRD patterns of higher metal loadings exhibit additional characteristic peaks of crystalline V2O5.

7. The vanadia densities of the catalysts vary, with the 1V sample having a density of 1.1 V/mn2, the 3.5V sample having a density of 3.7 V/nm2, and the 8V sample having a density of 10.4 V/mn2.

8. The UVvisible DRS spectra of the fresh catalysts indicate the increasing polymeric nature of vanadia species, while the spectra of the reduced catalysts typically show a V3+ state.

9. The average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina catalyst is calculated as 3.8, while that of the 3.5% VOx/alumina catalyst is calculated as 2.6. These values align with the findings from UVvisible DRS.

10. The 3.5V catalyst, which contains mainly polyvanadate surface species, exhibits the highest initial conversion but also experiences significant deactivation.

11. The 1V catalyst, which predominantly consists of isolated vanadates, has a low TOF for butane dehydrogenation and a high selectivity for carbon deposition.

12. The 8V catalyst, despite reducing to a 3+ oxidation state like the 3.5V catalyst, shows less effectiveness in butane dehydrogenation due to the presence of significantly more V2O5.

13. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1-butene, which then isomerizes to trans-2-butene.

14. The amount of carbon found on each catalyst, after removing the reaction intermediates, follows an order of alumina < 1V < 3.5V < 8V, indicating the role of vanadium species in generating non-C4 carbonaceous deposits.

15. Pore blocking by large carbonaceous entities is expected to influence the reaction over time, affecting the catalyst's performance.

16. This new understanding of the catalyst deactivation mechanism has significant implications for catalyst and process design, potentially enabling the creation of catalysts with enhanced stability and efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 对烷烃脱氢为烯烃的催化反应，利用氧化钒基催化剂替代铂和铬氧化物作为生产合成橡胶、塑料、汽车燃料成分和其他宝贵化学产品的基本构件，具有重要意义。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，主要集中在通过载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量调整分散在表面的钒物种的结构和物理化学性质，以改良催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 载体类型影响钒物种的分散度，支持表面面积影响反应物对这些物种的可达性，而金属负载则决定了钒物种的浓度，从而影响它们在脱氢反应中的活性和选择性。

3. 研究表明，氧化钒可以以孤立的单核钒物种、一维或二维多聚钒酸盐域或晶格态V2O5的形式存在。这些物种的结构在水蒸气暴露下会发生变化，而不同金属负载下的钒密度也有所差异。

4. 较低金属负载导致孤立的范德塔物种占主导地位，随后会凝聚成多聚钒酸盐并最终形成V2O5晶粒，随着负载量的增加，这种变化影响催化剂的性能。

5. BET表面积随金属负载的增加而降低，这是由于氧化钒物种堵塞了孔隙。这种现象会影响脱氢过程的效率。

6. X射线衍射图案证实，较低金属负载时的氧化钒物种在支撑表面上均匀分布，而较高金属负载时的X射线衍射模式显示出结晶的V2O5特征峰。

7. 催化剂中钒的密度各不相同，1V样品的密度为1.1 V/mn2，3.5V样品的密度为3.7 V/nm2，8V样品的密度为10.4 V/mn2。

8. 非可见光谱显示，新鲜催化剂的物种逐渐表现出更复杂的聚合性质，而还原后的催化剂的谱图通常显示V3+状态。

9. 计算得出，1% VOx/alumina催化剂的平均氧化态为3.8，而3.5% VOx/alumina催化剂的平均氧化态为2.6。这些值与非可见光谱的发现相符。

10. 主要由多聚钒酸盐表面物种构成的3.5V催化剂在初始转化率方面最高，但其也表现出最显著的失活。

11. 主要由孤立的范德塔物种构成的1V催化剂，在脱氢反应中的TOF较低，碳沉积选择性较高。

12. 尽管8V催化剂在还原后也呈现V3+氧化态，但由于存在更多V2O5晶粒，其在脱氢反应中的效果不如3.5V催化剂。

13. 但烷脱氢的主要产物是1-丁烯，随后转化为反式-2-丁烯。

14. 在去除反应中间体后，每种催化剂上的碳含量按照以下顺序排列：氧化铝 < 1V < 3.5V < 8V，这表明钒物种在生成非C4碳沉积物中起着作用。

15. 预期大碳化合物实体堵塞孔隙将影响反应过程的持续时间，从而影响催化剂的性能。

16. 对催化剂失活机制的新理解对催化剂和工艺设计有重大意义，可能使催化剂在脱氢反应中具有更高的稳定性和效率。
