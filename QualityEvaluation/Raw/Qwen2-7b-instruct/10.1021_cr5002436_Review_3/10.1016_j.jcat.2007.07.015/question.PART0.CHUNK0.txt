Journal of Catalysis 251 (2007) 5968 www.elsevier.com/locate/jcat Dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadia catalysts supported on θ-alumina
S. David Jackson , Sreekala Rugmini
WestCHEM, Department of Chemistry, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, Scotland, UK Received 27 March 2007; revised 10 July 2007; accepted 13 July 2007 Available online 23 August 2007 Abstract Dehydrogenation of n-butane was studied over three θ-alumina supported catalysts with different loadings of VOx. The catalysts were charac- terised by UVvisible spectroscopy in the as-prepared state and the reduced state. The catalyst with a 1% V loading exhibited a 4+ oxidation state after reduction, whereas the catalysts with 3.5 and 8% V loadings were reduced to a 3+ oxidation state. Oxygen chemisorption gave oxidation state values of 3.8 for the 1% catalyst and 2.6 for the 3.5% catalyst. Both the rate and turnover frequency data confirmed that the sample with the highest proportion of polyvanadate species (3.5V) was the most effective dehydrogenation catalyst. Analysis of the deactivation indicated that butane isomerisation was slow, and deactivation of the isomerisation site was faster than that of the dehydrogenation site. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation was 1-butene, which then isomerised to trans-2-butene. More than three-quarters of the deactivation was due to strongly bound reaction intermediates, which can be removed from the surface at room temperature by treatment in 2% O2/Ar. The amount of carbon found on each catalyst after removal of the reaction intermediates was alumina < 1V < 3.5V < 8V. Therefore, the VOx species plays a role in generation of the non-C4 carbonaceous deposits, suggesting either that spillover occurs from the VOx to the support or that some VOx sites catalyse the production of coke but do not catalyse dehydrogenation. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a highly impor- tant route for the production of olefins, which are the building blocks of synthetic rubbers, plastics, automotive fuel compo- nents, and other valuable chemical products. Industrial chem- ical processes use chromia- or platinum-based catalysts gen- erally supported on alumina and promoted with alkali metals [13]. These processes operate in a cyclical fashion to miti- gate against the severe catalyst deactivation that is observed.
The high temperatures required to achieve sensible yields for the dehydrogenation reaction lead to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition [4,5]. Numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based de- hydrogenation catalysts have been reported [610]. Alumina- supported vanadia has been extensively studied over the last few years, with the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts modified by the structural and physicochemical prop- * Corresponding author.

It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two- dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites.
At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovana- dates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases.
It is notable that the structure of dispersed vanadia changes on exposure to water vapour [1618]. The extent of this ef- fect depends on the nature of the support and has been studied in detail using XANES, Raman, and UVvisible spectroscopic studies [16]. Silica-supported vanadia is highly susceptible to structural changes on exposure to water at room temperature.
Water has little effect on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/TiO2 structure at room temperature, but at high temperature its effect on the surface structure becomes significant [17]. Further, the redox properties of the vanadia catalysts are important for reactions,and the average oxidation state during catalytic operation de- pends on the relative rates of reduction and reoxidation, as has been discussed previously [12,1921]. 0021-9517/$  see front matter  2007 Elsevier Inc.

A series of vanadia catalysts have been prepared and char- acterised using UVvisible excited Raman spectroscopy [22].
Earlier studies on 1 and 3.5% V on alumina showed that iso- lated VOx species are much more effective than polyvana- date species at catalysing carbon deposition during butane de- hydrogenation. It also has been observed that polyvanadate species are more effective than isolated vanadia species in de- hydrogenation [23]. Here we report the results of our inves- tigation on θ-alumina-supported vanadia catalysts for the di- rect dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes and butadiene.
Three different vanadia loadings (1, 3.5, and 8% V) on θ- alumina were prepared and characterised using X-ray diffrac- tion (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), oxy- gen uptake measurements, and thermal analyses. All three cat- alysts were evaluated, and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was carried out on the coked catalysts to study the nature of the carbon deposit.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impreg- nation with θ-alumina as the support. Before impregnation, the alumina was predried at 353 K overnight. An aqueous NH4VO3 (>99%, Aldrich) solution was used to prepare the catalyst with a 1% w/w V loading. Oxalic acid (99%, Aldrich) was added into the solutions (NH4VO3/oxalic acid = 0.5 molar) for high VOx loadings (3.5 and 8% V), to ensure dissolution of NH4VO3. The θ-alumina support (1/20 trilobes, surface area = 101 m2 g1,pore volume = 0.60 ml g1) was supplied by Johnson Matthey,
UK. After impregnation, the samples were mixed thoroughly
using a rotavap for 2 h at 350 K, dried by purging with air at 393 K overnight, and finally calcined at 823 K for 6 h. The alumina-supported vanadia catalysts with vanadium contents of 1, 3.5, and 8% are designated 1, 3.5, and 8V, respectively.
2.2. XRD analysis
The crystalline structure of the support and catalysts was studied by XRD analysis with a Siemens D 5000 instrument using CuKα radiation and operated at 40 kV and 30 mA.
2.3. UVvisible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
UVvisible spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary 5000 Win UVvisNIR spectrophotometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance attachment (Harrick) with full environmental con- trol. Catalyst reduction was carried in situ using H2 at a flow rate of 10 cm3 min1.
2.4. Nitrogen adsorption
The surface area of the support and the catalysts were deter- mined from the nitrogen adsorption curve using a Micromerit- ics Gemini III 2375 surface area analyzer after the samples were degassed at 393 K overnight.
2.5. Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the catalyst precursor and the catalysts was performed using an SDT Q 600 ther- mal analyser coupled to an online mass spectrometer to analyse evolved gases. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out using the thermal analyser. All measurements were performed with a heating rate of 5 deg min1.
2.6. Oxygen uptake measurements
Oxygen uptake measurements were carried out at room tem- perature and also at 873 K after the catalyst was reduced at 873 K using pure H2. After reduction, the catalyst surface was purged with He for 30 min, and then pulses of oxygen (15 mol) were introduced at the desired temperature un- til saturation. The amount of oxygen consumed was moni- tored using an online thermal conductivity detector connected to the effluent of the reactor. The percent uptake is expressed as [O(ads)/M(catalyst)] ×100, assuming an O:M stoichiometry of 1.
2.7. Dehydrogenation activity evaluation
The activity and selectivity of each catalyst were deter- mined using a fixed-bed, continuous-flow reactor. The catalyst (0.25 cm3) was reduced in pure hydrogen (40 cm3 min1) for 1 h at 873 K. The flow was switched to argon, and the system was purged for 30 min. Subsequently, n-butane was introduced at a flow rate of 60 cm3 min1 at 873 K (GHSV = 14,400) and atmospheric pressure. Reaction products were analysed at reg- ular intervals using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 Series-FID, Varian Chrompack capillary column CP7568). Re- generation of the catalysts was carried out using 2% O2/Ar.
After a dehydrogenation reaction, the catalyst was purged with argon at 873 K for 0.5 h to remove adsorbed reactant/products from the catalyst surface. The catalyst was then cooled to room temperature in a flow of argon, after which the gas flow was switched to 2% O2/Ar and the catalyst was heated to 873 K at a programmed heating rate of 10 deg min1. The temperature was maintained at 873 K until regeneration was complete. The total process was monitored by online mass spectrometry.The conversion and selectivity were calculated (on a car- bon basis) from the reaction products (P ), the total amount of n-butane fed to the reactor (X), and the amount of butane out (Y) along with the reaction products:%conversion =
(X Y)/X
× 100,%selectivity =
P/(X Y)
× 100.
The yield of a specific product was obtained by multiplying the n-butane conversion by the corresponding selectivity.
2.8. Microanalysis (C and H) of the spent catalysts
An Exeter Analytica CE-440 elemental analyzer was used to determine %C and %H in the catalysts after evaluation of dehydrogenation activity.

3. Results and discussion
The main characteristics of the vanadia catalysts used in the present study are given in Table 1. A decrease in BET surface area with higher metal loadings was generally observed and could be related to the blockage of pores by the VOx species.
Earlier studies on these catalysts revealed [22,23] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2,polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface den- sities of 1.24.4 V/nm2, and V2O5 formed at a surface den- Table 1 Physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts Sample Sample description Oxygen uptake Surface area (m2/g) At 300 K At 873 K θ-Alumina θ-Alumina

1.1 V/mn2 for the 1V sample, 3.7 V/nm2 for the 3.5V sam-
ple, and 10.4 V/mn2 for the 8V sample. XRD patterns of the support and the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. For lower metal loadings, XRD peak position and intensity were the same as for the support alumina, indicating (as expected) that the vanadium oxide species was well dispersed on the surface of the support.
However, the XRD pattern for 8V exhibited additional char- acteristic peaks of crystalline V2O5 at 2θ values of 26.3and
34.6[12,24].
Each sample was analysed by TGA-H2. A slow continuous loss of water at the beginning was followed by the reduction of vanadia species. Fig. 2 shows the TGA-H2 obtained with the support and the catalysts. The curves are broad, and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading in the order 8V < 3.5V < 1V, with reduction for each sample completed by 873 K. This difference in onset of reduction may be attributed to different reducibility of vanadia species, monovanadates, polyvanadates,and V2O5 coexisting on the catalysts surfaces. The weight loss at the reduction step increased with vanadia loading: 0.3% for 1V, 1.1 for 3.5V, and 2.1% for 8V. Translating these weights into oxygen loss reveals a 1:1 relationship between vanadium atoms and oxygen atom loss (Table 2). This suggests a 2-point change in the vanadium oxidation state; therefore, if the vana- dium was in a 5+ oxidation state before reduction, then it would convert to 3+ after reduction. This was investigated by in situ UVvisible DRS (Fig. 3). Before reduction, the catalysts were in a V5+ oxidation state with typical charge transfer bands at 267 nm (37,450 cm1) for 1V, 290 nm (34,480 cm1) for
3.5V, and 357 nm (28,000 cm1) for 8V. This change in posi-
tion of the charge transfer band is indicative of the increasing polymeric nature of the vanadia [25]. Over the course of the reduction, the spectrum changed (Fig. 4) to give a spectra typ- ical for a V3+ state with dd transitions at around 575 nm (17,390 cm1) for 3.5V and 625 nm (16,000 cm1) for 8V.
However the 1V spectrum is more indicative of V4+, with a sin- gle band at 585 nm (17,090 cm1).

Given that active vanadium surface species and their reduc- tion behaviours are important parameters that may determine the alkane dehydrogenation activity [2527], further investi- gation of the reduced species was undertaken using dioxygen chemisorption at 293 and 873 K. Bulk reoxidation at 873 K can be directly compared with the TGA-H2 weight loss figures.
In earlier work [23], we had used the bulk uptake figures as a measure of an average vanadium oxidation state when the cat- alyst was reduced. By this method, the average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina was calculated as 3.8, whereas the av- erage oxidation state for the 3.5% VOx/alumina was calculated as 2.6. Both of these figures are in excellent agreement with the findings from UVvisible DRS. The bulk reoxidation data in conjunction with the TGA results indicate that for the 1V catalyst containing principally isolated vanadate species, only 66% of the oxygen removed can be replaced. For the 3.5V cat- alyst, all of the oxygen removed can be replaced, whereas for the 8V catalyst, 141% of the oxygen removed can be replaced.
Fig. 5. UVvisible DRS spectrareduction and reoxidation.
This trend in difficulty of oxygen replacement also has been ob- served in TEOM studies [28] and is also seen in the UVvisible
DRS. Once reduced, the 3.5V sample did not regain its orig-
inal state even after high-temperature oxidation; however, the reduced 8V sample did convert to a species similar to the origi- nal state (Fig. 5).
3.1. Dehydrogenation of n-butane
Various aspects of supported vanadia catalysts have been ex- tensively studied for both the direct and oxidative dehydrogena- tion of n-butane [8,2932]. Dehydrogenation of n-butane was studied for the catalysts as well as for the support θ-alumina.
Fig. 6 shows activity profiles for the fresh and regenerated cat- alysts. The conversions and product distributions (analysis at 15 min) of fresh and regenerated catalysts are given in Ta- bles 3 and 4, respectively. The alumina support yielded only cracked products, with the yield of C1C3s remaining the same after vanadia incorporation, indicating that the alumina was the principal source of the cracked products formed over the cat- alysts. Previous characterisation by Raman spectroscopy [22] revealed that isolated VOx species dominated at surface den- sities <1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexist with monovanadates at surface densities of 1.24.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at surface density >4.4 V/nm2. Therefore, it is worthwhile to

and TOF data that the sample with the highest proportion of polvanadate species (3.5V) is the most effective dehydrogena- tion catalyst. These results are in keeping with earlier studies on ODH of propane using vanadia catalysts, where the data in- dicated that the monovanadate structure was significantly less active than polyvanadates [24]. The VOAl species present in monovanadate structures appear to be more difficult to re- 64

The dependence of conversion/yield on time on stream is different for catalysts with different surface vanadia species.
The 3.5V catalyst, which contains mainly polyvanadate sur- face species, gave the highest initial conversion but also ex- hibited the most significant deactivation. After regeneration,however, the 3.5V catalyst became more stable to deactivation,possibly reflecting the change in surface species as identified by UVvisible DRS. In comparison, the 1 and 8V catalysts showed no significant difference in behaviour after regenera- Table 6 Product composition (%) of butenes and 1,3-butadiene Catalyst C-4 product composition (%) Trans-2-butene 1-Butene Cis-2-butene 1,3-Butadiene Equilibrium

tion. 1,3-Butadiene appeared as one of the reaction products only when 3.5V was used for dehydrogenation, emphasizing the high activity and selectivity of polyvanadate species toward dehydrogenation.
Comparison of deactivation on a product basis revealed that the rate of deactivation was not identical for the butane isomers (Fig. 7). The rate of decay of 1-butene was systematically lower over each of the catalysts. Considering the ratio of butenes produced during the course of the reaction over the three cata- lysts provides more insight into the reaction sequence (Table 6).
Although 1-butene was the least thermodynamically favoured isomer, it was always present above the equilibrium value and became more dominant as the catalyst deactivated. Similarly,the equilibrium ratio of trans:cis was 1:1, yet the ratio typ- ically was >1.25:1. Achieving this behaviour requires various processes. First, any butane isomerisation must be slow, and the deactivation of the isomerisation site must be faster than that of the dehydrogenation site. Second, the primary product must be 1-butene, which then isomerises to trans-2-butene. Note that 1-butene cannot isomerise to solely to cis-2-butene, but can pos- sibly isomerise to both 2-butene isomers, with a bias toward the trans isomer.
Carbon deposition is the main cause of deactivation in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. Deposition of carbon oc- curs through progressive dehydrogenation, condensation, poly- merisation, and cyclisation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface. Olefinic precursors formed on the metal ac- tive sites are known to migrate to the support and convert through condensation and polymerisation reactions to form polyolefinic/polyaromatic/graphitic types of coke [3335].
Temperature-programmed techniques have been used to study gasification of coke on spent catalyst surfaces [36]. In the present study, we used TPO and microanalysis (of C and H) of spent catalysts to probe catalyst deactivation.
As expected, online MS indicated that all hydrocarbon com- ponents were rapidly swept out of the reactor at 873 K when the gas stream was switched from butane to argon, and no other gases apart from the argon carrier were detected during the cool-down period. However, when 2% O2/Ar was passed over the sample at room temperature, C4 species were evolved.
Fig. 8 shows the evolution of butane, butanes, and butadiene from the three catalysts and the alumina support. From the des- orption profiles, it can be seen that the amount of retained C4 was proportional to the amount of VOx on the surface. These species were desorbed from the catalyst on contact with oxy-

The finding of desorption of C4 gases,which are strongly adsorbed and stable at 873 K in an in- ert atmosphere but are easily displaced by an oxidising gas at room temperature, is surprising. This desorption process can be viewed as an oxidative displacement, resulting in recombina- tion of reaction intermediates (hydrogen and alkyl, alkenyl, and alkadienyl) from the surface of reduced VOx species and acid sites on the alumina. To understand the effect of these species on deactivation, the gas flow was switched back to argon and the catalyst was reheated to 873 K, at which point the flow was switched to butane and the activity was measured. The activity recorded was >75% of that regained after a full regeneration in- volving heating in O2/Ar at 873 K (Fig. 9). Indeed, after 1 h on stream, there was no detectable difference between room tem- perature regeneration and regeneration at 873 K. When a TPO was run following this desorption, combustion of carbon was observed. This reaction/regeneration cycle was repeated, and similar evolution of C4 gases at room temperature was ob- served (not shown). The TPO patterns of first use and regen- erated catalysts, shown in Figs. 10 and 11, demonstrate the presence of different types of coke species on the catalyst sur- faces over and above the C4 gases that are desorbed at room temperature. Note that the removal of this coke had little ef- fect on the regeneration of activity, suggesting that much of the polyaromatic/polyolefinic/graphitic coke identified by spec- troscopy was associated not with the VOx species, but rather with the support. The TPO of the 3.5V fresh catalyst after reac- tion indicated two different types of coke species, whereas that of regenerated catalyst showed only one peak. The temperature profile was not linear over the complete range, which could po- tentially lead to artefacts; however, the TPOs of the fresh and regenerated catalysts exhibited identical temperature profiles and thus should have been internally consistent. These results are in agreement with the reactivity profile and the UVvisible DRS in recording a change between the fresh and regenerated catalysts.
Spent catalysts after n-butane dehydrogenation activity eval- uation were analysed for total C and H content; the results are reported in Table 7. The amount of carbon on the used support could not be measured by the elemental analyser even though the support appeared light black in colour. The C:H ratio of 1V catalyst after evaluation was found to be 0.9, very close to that of polystyrene monomer [23]. However, the C:H ratio for the
3.5V spent catalyst was much higher than that for both the 1 and
8V catalysts, suggesting the presence of highly carbonaceous polyaromatic or graphitic carbon on the surface. The variation in the C:H ratio was as would be expected from the TPO data,with each catalyst having differing species present. The amount of carbon found on each catalyst also was in agreement with the TPO findings, exhibiting an order of carbon deposition of alu- mina of < 1V < 3.5V < 8V. Note that these analyses required exposure of the catalyst to air at room temperature, causing the catalyst to lose adsorbed butane, butanes, and butadiene. The findings indicate that the VOx species plays a role in the gen- eration of the non-C4 carbonaceous deposit, suggesting either that spillover occurs from the VOx to the support or that there are VOx sites that catalyse production of coke but do not catal- yse dehydrogenation.
4. Conclusions
Our UVvis spectroscopic characterisation and oxygen chemisorption study of 1, 3.5, and 8% VOx/θ-alumina cata- lysts combined with testing and TPO have revealed much about the nature of the active species and the cause of catalyst de- activation. The catalyst with a 1% V loading (1V) exhibited 66

This species gave a low TOF for butane dehydrogenation and a high selectivity for carbon lay- down. In contrast, the 3.5% V-loaded catalyst (3.5V) reduced to give a 3+ oxidation state and the highest proportion of poly- vanadate species [22]. This catalyst had the highest TOF for butane dehydrogenation and was the most effective catalyst.
The 8% V loaded catalyst (8V) contained significantly more V2O5 than 3.5V but also reduced to a 3+ oxidation state;however, it was noticeably less effective at butane dehydrogena- tion. Taken together, these results and those from the literature reveal that the optimum species for dehydrogenation is a re- duced polyvanadate. The exact nature of the species (e.g., the optimum polyvanadate array size), requires further investiga- tion.
We found that the primary product of butane dehydrogena- tion was 1-butene, which then isomerised to trans-2-butene.
Rather surprisingly, butane isomerisation was slow, and the de- activation profiles of the butanes showed sites that catalysed dehydrogenation and sites that catalysed butane isomerisation.
The isomerisation site deactivated faster than the dehydrogena- tion site, leading to an enhanced selectivity to 1-butene with increasing time on stream.
It has long been assumed that deactivation in these systems is due to carbon laydown and the formation of polynuclear aromatics. However, in this study we have been able to show that >75% of the observed catalyst deactivation is due not to polynuclear aromatics, but rather to strongly bound reaction in- termediates. These intermediates can be removed from the sur- face under mild conditions, as butane, butanes, and butadiene,by treatment in 2% O2/Ar at room temperature. This discovery has implications for catalyst regeneration and maintenance of activity. 68

This is not to say that polynuclear aromatics are not formed.
Indeed, TPO and Raman analysis [23] has revealed that polynu- clear aromatics are formed and have differing natures depend- ing on the vanadia species. However, they have little influence on catalyst deactivation in the early stages. Clearly, pore block- ing by these large entities can be expected to influence the reaction over time. The amount of carbon retained by each cat- alyst after removal of the reaction intermediates was alumina < 1V < 3.5V < 8V, indicating that VOx species also played a role in the generation of the non-C4 carbonaceous deposit.Our findings also indicate that spillover from the VOx to the support occurred and that some VOx sites catalysed coke pro- duction. The possibility of producing polyvanadates that catal- yse dehydrogenation but not carbon laydown is a tantalising prospect. Minor C1C3 products were formed over the alumina support and were generally independent of vanadia loading,suggesting that they had little effect on formation of the polynu- clear aromatics.This new understanding of the mechanism of catalyst de- activation has significant implications for catalyst and process design. Currently aggressive combustion of retained carbon, in all its forms, is used not only to regenerate the catalyst, but also to balance the heat requirements. It is possible to envision a fu- ture catalyst in which no polynuclear aromatics are deposited and any regeneration is subtly done in situ with little heat gen- eration, presenting new challenges to the process engineer.
