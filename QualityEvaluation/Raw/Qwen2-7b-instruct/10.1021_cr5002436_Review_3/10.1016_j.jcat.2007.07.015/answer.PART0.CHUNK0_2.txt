[3] "Alumina-supported vanadia has been extensively studied over the last few years, with the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts modified by the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed species supported on the surface [1115]."
[4] "It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites."
[5] "At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovana- dates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to produce olefins, which are essential components in synthetic rubber, plastics, automotive fuel, and other chemical products. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on the modification of catalyst activity and selectivity through the control of structural and physicochemical properties, particularly the nature and behavior of vanadium species on the catalyst surface. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have substantial impacts on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. For instance, at low vanadium coverages, isolated monovanadates dominate, condensing into polyvanadates and V2O5 crystallites as loading increases. The extent of this effect varies depending on the support material, which can be studied using spectroscopic techniques like XANES, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Catalysts with different vanadium loadings exhibit distinct oxidation states after reduction, with those containing the highest proportion of polyvanadate species showing superior dehydrogenation activity. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1-butene, which subsequently isomerizes to trans-2-butene. Deactivation mechanisms involve the accumulation of strongly bound reaction intermediates, which can be removed under mild conditions, such as treating the catalyst with 2% oxygen in argon at room temperature.

对于烷烃脱氢生产烯烃这一重要途径，使用钒氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品，主要驱动力是它们能够生产出合成橡胶、塑料、汽车燃料成分以及其他宝贵化学产品的基本组成部分——烯烃。自1980年代以来，对这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，通过控制催化剂表面的结构和物理化学性质，特别是钒物种的性质，来调整催化剂的活性和选择性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等参数对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为有着重大影响。例如，在低钒覆盖度时，孤立的单范德华物种占主导地位，随着负载量增加，它们会凝聚成多范德华域或最终形成V2O5晶体。这种效果的强度取决于支撑材料的性质，可以通过XANES、拉曼和紫外可见光谱等技术进行详细研究。不同负载量的催化剂在还原后显示出不同的氧化状态，那些含有最高比例多范德华物种的催化剂具有最佳的脱氢活性。但烷脱氢的主要产物是1-丁烯，随后异构化为顺式-2-丁烯。催化剂失活机制涉及强吸附反应中间体的积累，这些中间体可以在室温下通过处理催化剂与2%氧气的氩气混合物而被去除。
