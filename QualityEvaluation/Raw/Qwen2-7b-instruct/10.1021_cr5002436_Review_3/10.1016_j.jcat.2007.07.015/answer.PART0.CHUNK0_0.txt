The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective processes in the production of olefins, essential components in synthetic rubber, plastics, automotive fuel, and other chemicals. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on modifying the activity and selectivity of vanadia catalysts through adjustments to the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts are influenced by these variables. For instance, the 1% vanadium catalyst exhibited a 4+ oxidation state, while the 3.5% and 8% catalysts were reduced to a 3+ oxidation state. The catalyst with the highest proportion of polyvanadate species was found to be the most effective for dehydrogenation, based on both rate and turnover frequency data. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation was 1-butene, which then isomerized to trans-2-butene. Strongly bound reaction intermediates caused more than three-quarters of the deactivation, which could be removed from the surface at room temperature through treatment in 2% O2/Ar.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物在轻烷烃脱氢生产烯烃过程中的替代选择的探索，是出于对更高效、成本效益更高的产品生产的需求。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展，重点在于通过改变载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载来调整范德华催化剂的活性和选择性。这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为受这些变量的影响。例如，1%的钒催化剂显示出4+的氧化状态，而3.5%和8%的催化剂则被还原到3+的氧化状态。具有最高比例聚钒酸盐物种的催化剂被发现是最有效的脱氢催化剂，基于速率和周转频率数据。但烷的脱氢产物主要是1-丁烯，然后异构化为反式-2-丁烯。强结合反应中间体导致了超过四分之三的失活，可以通过在室温下使用2% O2/Ar处理从表面上除去。
