The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective processes in the production of olefins, essential components in synthetic rubber, plastics, automotive fuel, and other chemicals. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on modifying the activity and selectivity of vanadia catalysts through adjustments to the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts are influenced by these variables. For instance, the 1% vanadium catalyst exhibited a 4+ oxidation state, while the 3.5% and 8% catalysts were reduced to a 3+ oxidation state. The catalyst with the highest proportion of polyvanadate species was found to be the most effective for dehydrogenation, based on both rate and turnover frequency data. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation was 1-butene, which then isomerized to trans-2-butene. Strongly bound reaction intermediates caused more than three-quarters of the deactivation, which could be removed from the surface at room temperature through treatment in 2% O2/Ar.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. 

The literature highlights that high temperatures required for dehydrogenation lead to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition. Studies have reported numerous improvements and developments of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly alumina-supported vanadia catalysts, which can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites depending on the vanadium loading. Earlier studies showed that isolated VOx species are more effective than polyvanadate species in catalyzing carbon deposition during butane dehydrogenation. Polyvanadate species were found to be more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation. A series of vanadia catalysts were prepared and characterized using UVvisible excited Raman spectroscopy. The main characteristics of the catalysts used in the study are provided in Table 1.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to produce olefins, which are essential components in synthetic rubber, plastics, automotive fuel, and other chemical products. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on the modification of catalyst activity and selectivity through the control of structural and physicochemical properties, particularly the nature and behavior of vanadium species on the catalyst surface. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have substantial impacts on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. For instance, at low vanadium coverages, isolated monovanadates dominate, condensing into polyvanadates and V2O5 crystallites as loading increases. The extent of this effect varies depending on the support material, which can be studied using spectroscopic techniques like XANES, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Catalysts with different vanadium loadings exhibit distinct oxidation states after reduction, with those containing the highest proportion of polyvanadate species showing superior dehydrogenation activity. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1-butene, which subsequently isomerizes to trans-2-butene. Deactivation mechanisms involve the accumulation of strongly bound reaction intermediates, which can be removed under mild conditions, such as treating the catalyst with 2% oxygen in argon at room temperature.

对于烷烃脱氢生产烯烃这一重要途径，使用钒氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品，主要驱动力是它们能够生产出合成橡胶、塑料、汽车燃料成分以及其他宝贵化学产品的基本组成部分——烯烃。自1980年代以来，对这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，通过控制催化剂表面的结构和物理化学性质，特别是钒物种的性质，来调整催化剂的活性和选择性。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等参数对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为有着重大影响。例如，在低钒覆盖度时，孤立的单范德华物种占主导地位，随着负载量增加，它们会凝聚成多范德华域或最终形成V2O5晶体。这种效果的强度取决于支撑材料的性质，可以通过XANES、拉曼和紫外可见光谱等技术进行详细研究。不同负载量的催化剂在还原后显示出不同的氧化状态，那些含有最高比例多范德华物种的催化剂具有最佳的脱氢活性。但烷脱氢的主要产物是1-丁烯，随后异构化为顺式-2-丁烯。催化剂失活机制涉及强吸附反应中间体的积累，这些中间体可以在室温下通过处理催化剂与2%氧气的氩气混合物而被去除。

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to produce olefins, which are crucial components in synthetic rubbers, plastics, automotive fuel components, and other valuable chemical products. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on modifying the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts through the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed vanadium species.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Carrier type affects the dispersion of vanadium species, while support surface area influences the accessibility of reactants to these species. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium species, impacting their reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Research has revealed that vanadium oxide can exist in various forms, including isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. The structure of these species changes upon exposure to water vapor, and the vanadium density varies depending on the metal loading.

4. Lower metal loadings result in the predominance of isolated vanadates, which then condense into polyvanadates and eventually bulk V2O5 crystallites as the loading increases. This change in structure impacts the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The BET surface area decreases with higher metal loadings due to the blockage of pores by vanadium oxide species. This phenomenon affects the catalyst's efficiency in dehydrogenation processes.

6. XRD patterns confirm that the vanadium oxide species is well dispersed on the surface of the support for lower metal loadings, while the XRD patterns of higher metal loadings exhibit additional characteristic peaks of crystalline V2O5.

7. The vanadia densities of the catalysts vary, with the 1V sample having a density of 1.1 V/mn2, the 3.5V sample having a density of 3.7 V/nm2, and the 8V sample having a density of 10.4 V/mn2.

8. The UVvisible DRS spectra of the fresh catalysts indicate the increasing polymeric nature of vanadia species, while the spectra of the reduced catalysts typically show a V3+ state.

9. The average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina catalyst is calculated as 3.8, while that of the 3.5% VOx/alumina catalyst is calculated as 2.6. These values align with the findings from UVvisible DRS.

10. The 3.5V catalyst, which contains mainly polyvanadate surface species, exhibits the highest initial conversion but also experiences significant deactivation.

11. The 1V catalyst, which predominantly consists of isolated vanadates, has a low TOF for butane dehydrogenation and a high selectivity for carbon deposition.

12. The 8V catalyst, despite reducing to a 3+ oxidation state like the 3.5V catalyst, shows less effectiveness in butane dehydrogenation due to the presence of significantly more V2O5.

13. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1-butene, which then isomerizes to trans-2-butene.

14. The amount of carbon found on each catalyst, after removing the reaction intermediates, follows an order of alumina < 1V < 3.5V < 8V, indicating the role of vanadium species in generating non-C4 carbonaceous deposits.

15. Pore blocking by large carbonaceous entities is expected to influence the reaction over time, affecting the catalyst's performance.

16. This new understanding of the catalyst deactivation mechanism has significant implications for catalyst and process design, potentially enabling the creation of catalysts with enhanced stability and efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 对烷烃脱氢为烯烃的催化反应，利用氧化钒基催化剂替代铂和铬氧化物作为生产合成橡胶、塑料、汽车燃料成分和其他宝贵化学产品的基本构件，具有重要意义。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，主要集中在通过载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量调整分散在表面的钒物种的结构和物理化学性质，以改良催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 载体类型影响钒物种的分散度，支持表面面积影响反应物对这些物种的可达性，而金属负载则决定了钒物种的浓度，从而影响它们在脱氢反应中的活性和选择性。

3. 研究表明，氧化钒可以以孤立的单核钒物种、一维或二维多聚钒酸盐域或晶格态V2O5的形式存在。这些物种的结构在水蒸气暴露下会发生变化，而不同金属负载下的钒密度也有所差异。

4. 较低金属负载导致孤立的范德塔物种占主导地位，随后会凝聚成多聚钒酸盐并最终形成V2O5晶粒，随着负载量的增加，这种变化影响催化剂的性能。

5. BET表面积随金属负载的增加而降低，这是由于氧化钒物种堵塞了孔隙。这种现象会影响脱氢过程的效率。

6. X射线衍射图案证实，较低金属负载时的氧化钒物种在支撑表面上均匀分布，而较高金属负载时的X射线衍射模式显示出结晶的V2O5特征峰。

7. 催化剂中钒的密度各不相同，1V样品的密度为1.1 V/mn2，3.5V样品的密度为3.7 V/nm2，8V样品的密度为10.4 V/mn2。

8. 非可见光谱显示，新鲜催化剂的物种逐渐表现出更复杂的聚合性质，而还原后的催化剂的谱图通常显示V3+状态。

9. 计算得出，1% VOx/alumina催化剂的平均氧化态为3.8，而3.5% VOx/alumina催化剂的平均氧化态为2.6。这些值与非可见光谱的发现相符。

10. 主要由多聚钒酸盐表面物种构成的3.5V催化剂在初始转化率方面最高，但其也表现出最显著的失活。

11. 主要由孤立的范德塔物种构成的1V催化剂，在脱氢反应中的TOF较低，碳沉积选择性较高。

12. 尽管8V催化剂在还原后也呈现V3+氧化态，但由于存在更多V2O5晶粒，其在脱氢反应中的效果不如3.5V催化剂。

13. 但烷脱氢的主要产物是1-丁烯，随后转化为反式-2-丁烯。

14. 在去除反应中间体后，每种催化剂上的碳含量按照以下顺序排列：氧化铝 < 1V < 3.5V < 8V，这表明钒物种在生成非C4碳沉积物中起着作用。

15. 预期大碳化合物实体堵塞孔隙将影响反应过程的持续时间，从而影响催化剂的性能。

16. 对催化剂失活机制的新理解对催化剂和工艺设计有重大意义，可能使催化剂在脱氢反应中具有更高的稳定性和效率。

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation because they offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to precious metal catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on improving catalyst stability and activity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. 

2. Since the 1980s, the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research has evolved to improve catalyst stability and activity, with a focus on understanding the effects of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species behavior.

3. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several factors, including the type of carrier used, the surface area of the support, and the loading of vanadium. These factors impact the dispersion of vanadium species, which in turn affects their reactivity and stability.

4. The redox properties of vanadia catalysts play a crucial role in determining their performance. The average oxidation state during catalytic operations depends on the relative rates of reduction and reoxidation, which is an important consideration in the design of these catalysts.

5. Polyvanadate species have been found to be more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation reactions. The exact nature of the optimal polyvanadate array size for maximum dehydrogenation activity requires further investigation.

6. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1-butene, which then isomerizes to trans-2-butene. Surprisingly, butane isomerization is a slower process, contributing to the selectivity for 1-butene over time.

7. The findings suggest that the presence of VOx species plays a role in the generation of non-C4 carbonaceous deposits. This indicates that spillover from VOx to the support occurs, and some VOx sites catalyze coke production.

8. The potential to produce polyvanadates that catalyze dehydrogenation without causing carbon deposition presents a promising avenue for future catalyst development. This could lead to catalysts with minimal polynuclear aromatic deposition and efficient in-situ regeneration, offering new challenges for process engineers.
