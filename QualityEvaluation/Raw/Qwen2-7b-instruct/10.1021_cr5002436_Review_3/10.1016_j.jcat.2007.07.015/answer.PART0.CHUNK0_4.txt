[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a highly important route for the production of olefins, which are the building blocks of synthetic rubbers, plastics, automotive fuel components, and other valuable chemical products."
[2] "Industrial chemical processes use chromia- or platinum-based catalysts generally supported on alumina and promoted with alkali metals [13]."
[3] "These processes operate in a cyclical fashion to mitigate against the severe catalyst deactivation that is observed."
[4] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a highly important route for the production of olefins."
[5] "It is notable that the structure of dispersed vanadia changes on exposure to water vapour [1618]."
[6] "The extent of this effect depends on the nature of the support and has been studied in detail using XANES, Raman, and UVvisible spectroscopic studies [16]."
[7] "Silica-supported vanadia is highly susceptible to structural changes on exposure to water at room temperature."
[8] "Water has little effect on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/TiO2 structure at room temperature, but at high temperature its effect on the surface structure becomes significant [17]."
[9] "Further, the redox properties of the vanadia catalysts are important for reactions, and the average oxidation state during catalytic operation depends on the relative rates of reduction and reoxidation, as has been discussed previously [12,1921]."
[10] "A series of vanadia catalysts have been prepared and characterised using UVvisible excited Raman spectroscopy [22]."
[11] "Earlier studies on 1 and 3.5% V on alumina showed that isolated VOx species are much more effective than polyvanadate species at catalysing carbon deposition during butane dehydrogenation."
[12] "It also has been observed that polyvanadate species are more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation [23]."
[13] "The catalyst with a 1% V loading (1V) exhibited a 4+ oxidation state after reduction and existed principally as a monovanadate [22]."
[14] "This species gave a low TOF for butane dehydrogenation and a high selectivity for carbon laydown."
[15] "In contrast, the 3.5% V-loaded catalyst (3.5V) reduced to give a 3+ oxidation state and the highest proportion of polyvanadate species [22]."
[16] "This catalyst had the highest TOF for butane dehydrogenation and was the most effective catalyst."
[17] "The exact nature of the species (e.g., the optimum polyvanadate array size), requires further investigation."
[18] "We found that the primary product of butane dehydrogenation was 1-butene, which then isomerised to trans-2-butene."
[19] "Rather surprisingly, butane isomerisation was slow, and the deactivation profiles of the butanes showed sites that catalysed dehydrogenation and sites that catalysed butane isomerisation."
[20] "Clearly, pore blocking by these large entities can be expected to influence the reaction over time."
[21] "The amount of carbon retained by each catalyst after removal of the reaction intermediates was alumina < 1V < 3.5V < 8V, indicating that VOx species also played a role in the generation of the non-C4 carbonaceous deposit."
[22] "Our findings also indicate that spillover from the VOx to the support occurred and that some VOx sites catalysed coke production."
[23] "The possibility of producing polyvanadates that catalyse dehydrogenation but not carbon laydown is a tantalising prospect."

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation because they offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to precious metal catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on improving catalyst stability and activity. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. 

2. Since the 1980s, the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research has evolved to improve catalyst stability and activity, with a focus on understanding the effects of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species behavior.

3. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several factors, including the type of carrier used, the surface area of the support, and the loading of vanadium. These factors impact the dispersion of vanadium species, which in turn affects their reactivity and stability.

4. The redox properties of vanadia catalysts play a crucial role in determining their performance. The average oxidation state during catalytic operations depends on the relative rates of reduction and reoxidation, which is an important consideration in the design of these catalysts.

5. Polyvanadate species have been found to be more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation reactions. The exact nature of the optimal polyvanadate array size for maximum dehydrogenation activity requires further investigation.

6. The primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1-butene, which then isomerizes to trans-2-butene. Surprisingly, butane isomerization is a slower process, contributing to the selectivity for 1-butene over time.

7. The findings suggest that the presence of VOx species plays a role in the generation of non-C4 carbonaceous deposits. This indicates that spillover from VOx to the support occurs, and some VOx sites catalyze coke production.

8. The potential to produce polyvanadates that catalyze dehydrogenation without causing carbon deposition presents a promising avenue for future catalyst development. This could lead to catalysts with minimal polynuclear aromatic deposition and efficient in-situ regeneration, offering new challenges for process engineers.
