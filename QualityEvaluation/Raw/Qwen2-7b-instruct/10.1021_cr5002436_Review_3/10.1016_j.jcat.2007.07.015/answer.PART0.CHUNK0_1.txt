The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and selective catalysts for the production of olefins. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on modifying the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts by adjusting the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed species on the surface. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. 

The literature highlights that high temperatures required for dehydrogenation lead to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition. Studies have reported numerous improvements and developments of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly alumina-supported vanadia catalysts, which can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites depending on the vanadium loading. Earlier studies showed that isolated VOx species are more effective than polyvanadate species in catalyzing carbon deposition during butane dehydrogenation. Polyvanadate species were found to be more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation. A series of vanadia catalysts were prepared and characterized using UVvisible excited Raman spectroscopy. The main characteristics of the catalysts used in the study are provided in Table 1. The conversion and selectivity of the catalysts were calculated based on the reaction products and the total amount of n-butane fed to the reactor.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究，主要由生产烯烃的需求驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究不断发展，重点是通过调整表面分散物种的结构和物理化学性质来修改范德华支持催化剂的活性和选择性。载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载等变量在影响这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为方面起着关键作用。

文献表明，用于脱氢所需的高温会导致催化剂由于焦炭沉积而失活。已报道了对现有催化剂的改进和基于范德华的脱氢催化剂的发展，特别是氧化铝支持的范德华催化剂，它们可以以孤立的单体范德华物种、多维聚范德华域或块状V2O5晶粒的形式存在，具体取决于钒加载量。早期研究表明，在但烷脱氢过程中，孤立的VOx物种比聚范德华物种更有效于催化碳沉积。聚范德华物种被发现比孤立的范德华物种更有效地进行脱氢。一系列的范德华催化剂通过紫外可见激发拉曼光谱进行了制备和表征。研究使用的催化剂的主要特性在表1中提供。催化剂的转化率和选择性根据反应产物和输入到反应器中的正丁烷总量计算得出。
