[1] "This new process is energy-saving and environmentally friendly."
[2] "It was estimated that the energies required for producing 1 t of styrene by a present commercial process using steam and by a new process using CO2 were 1.5 · 109 and 1.9 · 108 cal, respectively."
[3] "The development of catalysts with improved dehydrogenation activity for the new process is required, since the commercial K-promoted iron oxide catalysts do not work effectively for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the propene selectivity of the catalytic reaction remains an unsolved problem due to the overoxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
[5] "Since CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of CO2 is attractive not only economically but also ecologically."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for energy-saving and environmentally friendly processes. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on optimizing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in influencing the performance of these catalysts. For instance, the use of CO2 as a reactant has gained attention due to its environmental benefits, offering an alternative to oxygen-based processes. However, achieving high propene selectivity without overoxidation remains a challenge. The utilization of CO2 in catalytic reactions not only promises economic advantages but also contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with ecological goals.

对钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索，主要是为了推动节能和环保工艺的发展。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点是优化催化剂中钒物种的性质与行为。载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等变量在影响催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。例如，二氧化碳作为反应物的使用因其环境效益而受到关注，为氧气基过程提供了一种替代方案。然而，在避免过氧化导致丙烯过度氧化的同时实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个难题。利用二氧化碳在催化反应中的应用不仅能够带来经济优势，还能有助于减少温室气体排放，符合生态目标。
