The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on improving catalyst activity, stability, and selectivity. Key factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The carrier type can affect the dispersion of vanadium species, influencing their reactivity. Surface area impacts the amount of active sites available for reactions, while metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium, affecting its oxidation state and coordination environment. Variables such as synthesis conditions, impurities, and post-treatment processes also play crucial roles in shaping the properties of vanadium-based catalysts. The evolution of this field has led to the development of novel catalyst designs that offer improved performance over traditional Pt and CrOx catalysts, contributing to advancements in petrochemical processing and sustainable energy applications.

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the increasing interest in energy-saving and environmentally friendly processes. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalyst performance through modifications such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These changes influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalysts, enhancing their efficiency in paraffin dehydrogenation.

2. The use of CO2 in the dehydrogenation process is attractive not only economically but also ecologically due to its role in promoting energy savings and environmental friendliness. This process aims to reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact associated with traditional dehydrogenation methods.

3. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts has been extensively studied. The catalysts' characteristics, including their structure and surface properties, have been thoroughly characterized using advanced analytical techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, UVVis DRS, XPS, SEM, EDX, FTIR, and surface acidity/basicity measurements. These characterizations have helped in understanding the correlation between the catalyst's properties and its catalytic activities in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The XRD patterns of the GZ catalysts reveal the presence of both tetragonal and monoclinic phases of ZrO2, with the transformation from the metastable tetragonal phase being retarded upon the incorporation of Ga2O3. The intensity of diffractive peaks for GZ catalysts decreases with increased Ga2O3 content, indicating a decrease in the crystallinity of ZrO2.

5. Raman spectroscopy analysis shows that the Raman peaks become less intense and the resolution of certain bands decreases with increased Ga2O3 content, suggesting a decrease in the degree of crystalline ZrO2 order.

6. UVVis DRS studies confirm the presence of two intense adsorption maxima at 210 and 228 nm, associated with the normal energy gap transition in crystalline ZrO2, and a broad shoulder peak at around 305 nm, related to transitions involving localized levels near the valence and conduction bands due to defects and non-stoichiometry.

7. The surface acidity and basicity of the GZ catalysts are measured using NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD methods, respectively. The results indicate that the number of acid sites increases with the Ga2O3 content up to 15%, after which it decreases. Similarly, the number of base sites first increases and then decreases with the Ga2O3 content.

8. Incorporating gallium oxide into ZrO2 catalysts enhances the catalytic activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, although the selectivity to styrene decreases to some extent. The activity of GZ catalysts is approximately twice that of ZrO2. The conversion of ethylbenzene on GZ catalysts initially increases and then decreases with increased Ga2O3 content.

9. The dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts is less efficient compared to ethylbenzene dehydrogenation. The catalysts deactivate faster during propane dehydrogenation, and the selectivity to propene is lower than that to styrene, indicating a higher propensity for cracking reactions during propane dehydrogenation.

10. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture plays a crucial role in promoting the dehydrogenation reaction through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Additionally, CO2 might facilitate the elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction, contributing to the overall catalytic performance of the Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 对于帕拉芬脱氢，对铂和CrOx的替代物的钒氧化物基催化剂的探索，已由对节能和环境友好的过程的兴趣驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经显著发展，重点是通过改变载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等方法来改进催化剂性能。这些变化影响了催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，从而提高了它们在帕拉芬脱氢方面的效率。

2. 在使用CO2的过程中，CO2的使用不仅在经济上而且在生态上都是吸引人的，因为它有助于减少传统脱氢方法所需的能量消耗和环境影响。这个过程旨在降低与传统脱氢方法相关的能源消耗和环境影响。

3. 对于乙基苯和丙烷在Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂上的脱氢反应进行了广泛的研究。通过X射线衍射、拉曼光谱、紫外可见漫反射光谱、X射线光电子光谱、扫描电子显微镜、能谱X射线、傅里叶变换红外光谱、NH3和CO2的温度程序脱附（NH3-TPD和CO2-TPD）以及N2吸附方法对催化剂的特性进行了详尽的表征。这些表征帮助理解了催化剂的性质与其在脱氢反应中的催化活性之间的关系。

4. GZ催化剂的X射线衍射图案揭示了锆氧二面体和单斜晶相的存在，其中从不稳定四方相到热力学有利的单斜相的转变被Ga2O3的引入所抑制。随着Ga2O3含量的增加，GZ催化剂的衍射峰强度减弱，表明ZrO2的结晶度下降。

5. 拉曼光谱分析显示，Raman峰的强度降低，某些波段的分辨率降低，这表明ZrO2的结晶度下降。

6. 紫外可见漫反射光谱研究表明，存在两个强烈的吸收最大值，分别位于210和228纳米，与晶体ZrO2的正常能量带隙转换相关联，并且大约在305纳米处有一个宽的肩峰，与涉及价带和导带附近局部化能级的转换有关，由于缺陷和非化学计量比。

7. GZ催化剂的表面酸性和碱性通过NH3-TPD和CO2-TPD方法测量。结果表明，在Ga2O3含量增加至15%时，酸性位点的数量增加，之后减少。同样地，总碱性位点的数量首先增加，然后减少随Ga2O3含量的变化。

8. 将镓氧化物引入到ZrO2催化剂中显著增强了乙基苯脱氢的活性，尽管选择性到苯乙烯略有下降。GZ催化剂的活性约为ZrO2的两倍。随着Ga2O3含量的增加，乙基苯在GZ催化剂上的转化率最初增加，然后减少。

9. 丙烷在Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂上的脱氢效率低于乙基苯脱氢。催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中更快地失活，丙烯的选择性低于苯乙烯，这表明在丙烷脱氢过程中有更高的裂解反应倾向。

10. 反应混合物中存在的CO2在促进脱氢反应方面起着关键作用，通过逆水煤气变换反应。此外，CO2可能通过布杜尔反应帮助去除焦炭，从而提高Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂在脱氢反应中的整体催化性能。
