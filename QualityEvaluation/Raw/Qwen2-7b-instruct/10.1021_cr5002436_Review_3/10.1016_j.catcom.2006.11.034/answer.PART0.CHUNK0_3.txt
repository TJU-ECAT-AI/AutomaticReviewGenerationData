The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for energy-saving and environmentally friendly processes. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on the impact of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type and surface area can influence the dispersion of vanadium, affecting its reactivity and stability. Metal loading, particularly the concentration of vanadium, plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards desired products. Through careful optimization of these parameters, researchers have aimed to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of paraffin dehydrogenation processes, leading to the development of more effective and eco-friendly catalysts.
