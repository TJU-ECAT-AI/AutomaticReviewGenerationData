[1] "Recently, the dehydrogenation of EB in the presence of CO2 has attracted increasing interest."
[2] "It was estimated that the energies required for producing 1 t of styrene by a present commercial process using steam and by a new process using CO2 were"
[3] "The development of catalysts with improved dehydrogenation activity for the new process is required, since the commercial K-promoted iron oxide catalysts do not work effectively for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the propene selectivity of the catalytic reaction remains an unsolved problem due to the overoxidation of propane to carbon dioxide."
[5] "Since CO2 is one of 1566-7367/$ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.catcom.2006.11.034"
[6] "It is interesting to compare dehydrogenation of EB and propane in the presence of CO2. In this work, dehydroge- nation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 cat- alysts has been investigated and compared."
[7] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the intensity of diffractive peaks for GZ catalysts is weakened,suggesting that the degree of crystalline ZrO2 order is decreased."
[8] "However, the present industrial process is thermodynami- cally limited and, moreover, it is very energy consuming due to the required excess of superheated steam and higher reaction temperatures."
[9] "This new process is energy-saving and environmentally friendly."
[10] "It can be seen that both tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 are present in pure ZrO2."
[11] "Moreover, the fraction of monoclinic zirconia, estimated by the formula proposed by Toraya et al. [18], is obviously higher than that of tetragonal zirconia."
[12] "The sharpness of all Raman peaks and, in particular, the resolution of two bands at 269 and 317 nm indicates that ZrO2 and Ga2O3ZrO2 mixed oxides are highly crystalline."
[13] "The bands at 210 and 228 nm are associated with the normal energy gap transition in crystalline ZrO2,"
[14] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, both the intensity of Raman peaks and the resolution of the above two bands become lower, suggesting a decrease in degree of crystalline ZrO2 order."
[15] "The above result also indicates that the surface phase is different from the bulk phase for the 5GZ catalyst."
[16] "The bands at 210 and 228 nm are associated with the normal energy gap transition in crystalline ZrO2,"
[17] "The above observation is in consistence with the XRD results."
[18] "Moreover, the surface area of GZ cat- alysts increases with an increase in Ga2O3 content."
[19] "The above observation is in consistence with the XRD results."
[20] "The nature of acid sites present on the 15GZ catalyst as a representative was measured in situ by FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption (not shown)."
[21] "The same variation trend of GZ catalysts for EB dehydrogenation activity, the number of medium to strong acid sites and total base sites with the Ga2O3 content is observed."
[22] "Moreover, the selectivity to propene is lower than that to styrene, indicating that the side reaction of cracking is more serious during the dehydrogenation of propane."
[23] "In the absence of CO2, EB conversion and propane conver- sion over the 15GZ catalyst are 32.3% and 26.1%, respec- tively, lower than those in the presence of CO2."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on improving catalyst activity, stability, and selectivity. Key factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The carrier type can affect the dispersion of vanadium species, influencing their reactivity. Surface area impacts the amount of active sites available for reactions, while metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium, affecting its oxidation state and coordination environment. Variables such as synthesis conditions, impurities, and post-treatment processes also play crucial roles in shaping the properties of vanadium-based catalysts. The evolution of this field has led to the development of novel catalyst designs that offer improved performance over traditional Pt and CrOx catalysts, contributing to advancements in petrochemical processing and sustainable energy applications.
