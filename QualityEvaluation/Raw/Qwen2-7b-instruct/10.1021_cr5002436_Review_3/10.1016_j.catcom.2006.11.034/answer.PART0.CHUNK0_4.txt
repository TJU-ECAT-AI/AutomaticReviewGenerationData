[1] "Recently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen has been reported to give rather high propene selectivity."
[2] "Since CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases, the use of CO2 is attractive not only economically but also ecologically."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 has been studied over various catalysts, such as Cr2O3 [12,13], rare earth vanadates [14] and Ga2O3 [1517]."
[4] "It is interesting to compare dehydrogenation of EB and propane in the presence of CO2."
[5] "In this work, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts has been investigated and compared."
[6] "The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVVis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectros-opy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), temperature programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD) and N2 adsorp- tion methods."
[7] "The catalytic activities are correlated with the results of surface acidity and basicity measurements."
[8] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the conversion of EB on GZ catalysts first increases and then decreases."
[9] "The selectivity to styrene at the maximum conversion is 93.0%."
[10] "The same variation trend was observed for the yield of styrene, since the selectivity to styrene is similar."
[11] "The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is enhanced markedly after the incorporation of gallium oxide."
[12] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the conversion of EB on GZ catalysts first increases and then decreases."
[13] "The selectivity to styrene at the maximum conversion is 93.0%."
[14] "The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is very low."
[15] "After the incorporation of gallium oxide into ZrO2, the catalyst becomes much more active, suggesting that Ga2O3 is the major active component for propane dehydro- genation in the presence of CO2."

The research explores the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx) for the dehydrogenation of paraffins. This area of research has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. These variables play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes. Specifically, the incorporation of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) into zirconia (ZrO2) modifies the catalyst's structure and enhances its dehydrogenation capabilities for ethylbenzene and propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). The surface acidity and basicity of the catalysts are correlated with their catalytic activities, providing insights into optimizing catalyst performance for these reactions.

这项研究探索了使用钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）在芳烃脱氢方面的替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究不断发展，重点关注载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等变量对钒物种性质和行为的影响。这些因素对于确定催化剂在脱氢过程中的效率和选择性至关重要。特别是，将镓氧化物（Ga2O3）引入氧化锆（ZrO2）中改变了催化剂的结构，并增强了其在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的条件下对乙苯和丙烷的脱氢能力。催化剂的表面酸性和碱性与它们的催化活性之间存在相关性，为优化这些反应的催化剂性能提供了见解。
