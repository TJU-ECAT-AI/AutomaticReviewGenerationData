[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "A new computational method, though, is poised to help with the problem. Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."
[5] "Billinge explains that the procedure was inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation (downgrading) that are used to rank teams in European soccer leagues, such as La Liga in Spain."
[6] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."

Numerical methods can help solve the atomic structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles, by using data from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. A new computational method called the "Liga" method has been developed for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs). This method was inspired by the rules of promotion and relegation in European soccer leagues. It was used to deduce the structure of C60, a buckyball, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample. The calculated data set matched the experimentally measured results closely, but the computed structure deviated slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations.

数值方法可以通过使用X射线和中子衍射研究的数据来解决缺乏长期有序性的材料（如纳米颗粒）的原子结构。开发了一种新的计算方法“联盟”方法，用于通过原子对分布函数（PDF）确定非周期性材料的原子结构。该方法灵感来源于欧洲足球联赛中的升班降级规则。它被用来推断C60（巴基球）的结构，使用从固体样品的中子散射测量中获得的PDF数据。计算数据集与实验测量结果匹配得相当好，但计算结构在一定程度上偏离了C60的理想结构，这是由于数据噪声和实验限制造成的。
