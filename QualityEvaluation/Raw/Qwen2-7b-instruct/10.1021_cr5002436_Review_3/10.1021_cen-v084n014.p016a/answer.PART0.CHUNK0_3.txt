1. The method being discussed here involves using numerical procedures to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and materials lacking long-range order, without relying on traditional crystallography techniques. This is particularly useful for materials like nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, where the absence of long-range order makes crystallography unsuitable. The researchers use data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples, specifically atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), which provide information on interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs sharing specific distances.

2. The computational method developed allows for the determination of atomic structures with subangstrom resolution, even in cases where conventional crystallographic methods fail. This is achieved through an iterative process that ranks the agreement between experimental and theoretical structure data. The method was applied to determine the structure of C60, using PDF data from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckyballs.

3. The atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) used in this method consist of lists detailing interatomic spacings along with a histogram indicating the number of atom pairs that share a particular spacing. These PDFs are crucial for building up cluster structures atom by atom, comparing theoretical data with experimental measurements to refine the structure model.

1. 讨论的方法涉及使用数值过程来确定无序材料（如纳米尺度的半导体块）的原子结构，而不依赖传统的晶体学技术。这特别适用于没有长程有序的材料，例如纳米尺度的半导体块，因为这些材料的缺失使得晶格学方法无法应用。研究人员使用粉末和其他非晶态样品的X射线和中子衍射研究数据，特别是原子对分布函数（PDF），提供了关于原子间距离的信息以及共享特定距离的原子对的数量。 

2. 开发的计算方法允许在常规晶体学方法失败的情况下，通过迭代过程对无序材料进行原子结构的确定，甚至可以达到亚埃级的分辨率。这种方法通过比较实验数据与理论结构数据的一致性来进行排名，从而实现结构模型的优化。该方法被应用于确定Buckyball固体相样本的C60结构，使用中子散射测量得到的PDF数据。

3. 这种方法使用的原子对分布函数（PDF）包括列出的原子间距列表以及指示共享特定距离的原子对数量的直方图。这些PDF对于逐个原子构建簇结构至关重要，通过比较理论数据与实验测量结果来精化结构模型。
