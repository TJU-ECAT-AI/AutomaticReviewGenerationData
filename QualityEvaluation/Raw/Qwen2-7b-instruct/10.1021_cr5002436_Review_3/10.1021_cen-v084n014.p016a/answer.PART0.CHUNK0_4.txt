Numerical methods have been developed to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies. These PDFs consist of lists of interatomic spacings and histograms indicating the frequency of atom pairs sharing specific spacings. Researchers have successfully applied this method to deduce the structure of C60 buckyballs, matching experimental data closely but with slight deviations attributed to noise and experimental limitations. This new approach is expected to be broadly applicable to solving the structures of other aperiodic materials.

已经开发出数值方法来确定非晶材料的原子结构，使用源自X射线和中子衍射研究的原子对分布函数（PDF）。这些PDF包括原子间距离的列表和表示共享特定距离的原子对频率的直方图。研究团队成功地应用了这种方法来推断C60球状分子的结构，实验数据匹配得相当好，但存在微小差异，归因于数据噪声和实验限制。这种新的方法有望广泛应用于解决其他非晶材料的结构问题。
