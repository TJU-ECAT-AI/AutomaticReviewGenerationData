[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "A new computational method, though, is poised to help with the problem. Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."

Numerical methods have been developed to solve the atomic structures of materials that lack long-range order, such as nanoparticles and aperiodic materials, using data from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples. An example of such a method is the Liga method, which was applied to determine the structure of C60 using PDF data from neutron-scattering measurements.

对于缺乏长程有序性的材料，如纳米颗粒和无序材料，已经开发出数值方法来确定其原子结构，使用非晶态样品的X射线和中子衍射研究数据。Liga方法就是其中一种应用实例，它被用于通过中子散射测量的固体相球状体的PDF数据来确定C60的结构。
