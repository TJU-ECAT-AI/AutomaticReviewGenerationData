[1] "Yet for certain types of solids, such as nanometer-sized chunks of semiconductors, the absence of long-range order rules out the possibility of solving the structure via crystallography."
[2] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[3] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[4] "Named accordingly, the Liga method was used to deduce the structure of C60, using PDF data obtained from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample of buckeyballs."
[5] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

Numerical methods have been developed to solve the structures of materials lacking long-range order, particularly nanoparticles and other aperiodic materials. These methods utilize atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), which are derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and noncrystalline samples. An algorithm called Liga was applied to deduce the structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) using PDF data from neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample. The calculated data matched the experimental results closely, though slight deviations were noted due to noise in the data and experimental limitations.

已经开发出数值方法来解决缺乏长程有序的材料的结构，特别是纳米颗粒和其他非周期性材料。这些方法利用了从粉末和非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究中得到的原子对分布函数（PDF）。名为Liga的算法被应用于使用从固体相球状碳分子样本的中子散射测量数据推断C60的结构。计算数据与实验结果非常吻合，尽管由于数据噪声和实验限制，计算结构与理想C60结构略有偏差。
