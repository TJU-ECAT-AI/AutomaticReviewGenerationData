[1] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."
[2] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species."
[3] "With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the por- tion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."
[4] "However, the domain size of the tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species is approximately independent on vanadium loadings."
[5] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[6] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetra- hedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s through research focusing on carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.
2. After calcination at 873 K with 4.5 wt.% vanadium loading, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate. These species are the main contributors to the catalyst's activity.
3. As vanadium loadings increase up to 13.2 wt.%, the portion of dispersed VOx species decreases while the portion of vanadium in the crystalline AlVO4 phase increases. This suggests that the AlVO4 phase formation competes with dispersed VOx species.
4. The domain size of the tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species remains relatively constant across varying vanadium loadings, indicating that the dispersion of these species rather than their domain size impacts the catalyst's activity.
5. The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. This highlights the importance of these species' distribution on the catalyst's surface.
6. Propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation process depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Higher dispersion leads to increased propene selectivity, emphasizing the role of species dispersion in determining product selectivity.

1. 自1980年代以来，通过关注载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等因素，对以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品的研究已经发展起来。这些因素显著影响了这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为。
2. 在873 K下，经过4.5 wt.% 钒负载的煅烧后，分散的孤立和聚合的V5+物种在四面体协调下占主导地位，其中后者是主要物种。
3. 当钒负载增加到13.2 wt.%时，分散的VOx物种的比例减少，而结晶的AlVO4相中的钒比例增加。这表明AlVO4相的形成与分散的VOx物种的竞争。
4. 四面体协调的聚合V5+物种的域大小在不同的钒负载下保持相对不变，表明这些物种的分布而不是其域大小影响催化剂的活性。
5. 烷烃氧化脱氢的催化活性由分散的孤立和聚合四面体协调的V5+物种的数量决定。这强调了这些物种在催化剂表面上的分布对产物选择性的重要性。
6. 烯烃选择性在氧化脱氢过程中取决于四面体协调的V5+物种的分布。更高的分布导致了更高的烯烃选择性，强调了物种分布在确定产物选择性方面的作用。
