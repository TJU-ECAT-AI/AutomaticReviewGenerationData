<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed.</p>
<p>The objective of the present work is, for that reason, the study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium loadings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium.</p>
<p>The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.</p>
<p>Results of characterization for the sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium calcined at 773 and 873 K show that the AlVO4 phase was formed at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Therefore, it is suggested that disturbed VOx polyhedra, mainly in octahedral coordination, have to be considered as a precursor for the AlVO4 phase.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. It is concluded that the AlVO4 phase has only a low catalytic activity since an increase of their amount leads to a decrease of catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity.</p>

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is an exothermic reaction, often conducted at temperatures up to 873 K or higher. High vanadium loadings on alumina supports are used to study the nature of vanadium oxide species at these conditions.

2. The study focuses on characterizing vanadium oxide species formed on alumina after calcination at 873 K with varying vanadium loadings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt%.

3. The highest propene selectivity was achieved with the sample having the greatest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

4. The AlVO4 phase forms at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species when alumina is calcined at 773 K or higher temperatures. Disturbed VOx polyhedra, predominantly in octahedral coordination, are proposed as precursors for the AlVO4 phase.

5. The activity of the catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is influenced by the quantity of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. The AlVO4 phase exhibits minimal catalytic activity.

6. Propene selectivity is contingent upon the dispersion of tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; higher dispersion correlates with higher propene selectivity.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢反应是一个强放热反应，使用更高浓度的原料时，在催化床中观察到的最高温度约为873 K或更高。

2. 本研究的重点是分析在873 K高温下，不同钒负载量（4.5至13.2 wt%）的铝酸盐支持物上形成的钒氧化物物种的性质。

3. 在这些条件下，通过样品获得的最高丙烯选择性来自于具有最大分散的孤立和聚合四面体配合的V5+物种。

4. 当铝酸盐在773 K或更高温度下煅烧时，AlVO4相形成于八面体配合的V5+物种的损失。推测被破坏的VOx多面体，主要是八面体配合，作为AlVO4相的前驱体。

5. 钒氧化物物种的活性对于丙烷氧化脱氢反应的影响是由分散的孤立和聚合四面体配合的V5+物种的数量决定的。AlVO4相的活性很低。

6. 丙烯选择性取决于四面体配合的V5+物种的分散度；分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。
