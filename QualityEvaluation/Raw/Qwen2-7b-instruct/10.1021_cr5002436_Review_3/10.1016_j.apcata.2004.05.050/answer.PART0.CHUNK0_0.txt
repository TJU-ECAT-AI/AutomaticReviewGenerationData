[1] "The nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."
[2] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species."
[3] "With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the portion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."
[4] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[5] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding how various factors like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species. 
2. At a calcination temperature of 873 K for V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3, the dominant vanadium species are dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ in tetrahedral coordination. 
3. As vanadium loadings increase up to 13.2 wt.%, the portion of dispersed VOx species decreases, while the portion of vanadium present in the crystalline AlVO4 phase increases.  
4. The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.
5. Propene selectivity is determined by the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species, with higher dispersion leading to higher propene selectivity.

1. 自1980年代以来，对于将范德华氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的探索已经取得了显著进展，着重于理解载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载如何影响范德华物种的性质和行为。
2. 对于在873 K下煅烧的V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3，主导的钒物种是分散的孤立和聚合的V5+，呈四面体协调。 
3. 当钒负载增加至13.2 wt.%时，分散的VOx物种的比例下降，而存在于结晶AlVO4相中的钒比例增加。  
4. 烷基化脱氢的催化活性受分散的孤立和聚合四面体协调V5+物种的数量影响。 
5. 丙烯选择性由四面体协调V5+物种的分散度决定，分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。
