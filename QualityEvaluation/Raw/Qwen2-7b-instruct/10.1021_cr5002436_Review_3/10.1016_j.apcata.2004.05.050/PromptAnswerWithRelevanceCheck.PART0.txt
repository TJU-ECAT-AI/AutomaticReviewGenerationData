1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is an exothermic reaction, often conducted at temperatures up to 873 K or higher. High vanadium loadings on alumina supports are used to study the nature of vanadium oxide species at these conditions.

2. The study focuses on characterizing vanadium oxide species formed on alumina after calcination at 873 K with varying vanadium loadings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt%.

3. The highest propene selectivity was achieved with the sample having the greatest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

4. The AlVO4 phase forms at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species when alumina is calcined at 773 K or higher temperatures. Disturbed VOx polyhedra, predominantly in octahedral coordination, are proposed as precursors for the AlVO4 phase.

5. The activity of the catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is influenced by the quantity of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. The AlVO4 phase exhibits minimal catalytic activity.

6. Propene selectivity is contingent upon the dispersion of tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; higher dispersion correlates with higher propene selectivity.

[1] "Vanadium species formed on the alumina support after calcination between 773 and 973 K at vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt.% were characterized with different methods (51V NMR, ESR, H2-TPR and in situ UVvis-DRS) and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "By calcination at 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species mainly in tetrahedral coordination, a crystalline AlVO4 phase was formed. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%)."
[3] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[4] "The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity. The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts under various conditions. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the performance of these catalysts.

2. The nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on the vanadium loading but also on the calcination temperature. After calcination at 873 K with varying vanadium loadings (4.5 to 13.2 wt.%), dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate. The proportion of these dispersed VOx species decreases with increasing vanadium loadings, while the portion of vanadium present in the crystalline AlVO4 phase increases.

3. The domain size of the tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species remains approximately the same across different vanadium loadings. This indicates that the dispersion of the catalytically active centers on the alumina surface is a key factor influencing the activity and selectivity of the catalysts.

4. The AlVO4 phase forms at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species at lower vanadium loadings and calcination temperatures. It is suggested that disturbed VOx polyhedra, mainly in octahedral coordination, serve as precursors for the AlVO4 phase. The formation of this phase depends on the dispersion of the adsorbed vanadium species on alumina after drying. After calcination at 973 K, the AlVO4 phase decomposes into vanadia and alumina.

5. The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity, as evidenced by the decrease in activity with an increase in their amount. Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; higher dispersion leads to higher propene selectivity.

6. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites. In contrast, CO2 formation is approximately independent from the dispersion of the VOx species.

1. 用于替代铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）进行烷烃脱氢的钒氧化物基催化剂的探索，主要是为了寻找成本效益高且环境友好的替代品。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，重点在于理解在不同条件下这些催化剂中钒物种的性质与行为。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等因素对这些催化剂的性能具有关键影响。

2. 铝氧化物支持上的钒物种的性质不仅取决于钒负载量，还取决于煅烧温度。在873 K的煅烧温度下，不同范德华负载量（4.5至13.2 wt.%）下，分散的孤立和聚合的V5+表面物种主要以四面体协调为主导。随着范德华负载量的增加，这些分散的VOx物种的比例减少，而作为AlVO4相存在的钒的比例增加。

3. 四面体协调的聚合V5+物种的域大小在不同的范德华负载量下保持大致相同。这表明，活性中心在铝氧化物表面的分布是决定催化剂活性和选择性的重要因素。

4. 当使用较低的钒负载量和煅烧温度时，AlVO4相形成于八面体协调的V5+物种的损失上。有建议指出，被干燥后吸附在铝氧化物上的混乱VOx多面体可能是AlVO4相的前体。在973 K的煅烧温度下，AlVO4相分解为氧化钒和铝。

5. 丙烯氧化的催化活性由分散的孤立和聚合四面体协调的V5+物种的数量决定。AlVO4相和块状V2O5只有较低的催化活性，因为其含量的增加导致活性降低。丙烯选择性依赖于四面体协调的V5+物种的分散；较高的分散导致更高的丙烯选择性。

6. CO是丙烯氧化的主要产物，并且其形成随活性位点分散度的降低而增加。相比之下，CO2形成几乎不受VOx物种分散度的影响。
