[1] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."
[2] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species."
[3] "With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the por- tion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."
[4] "However, the domain size of the tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species is approximately independent on vanadium loadings."
[5] "Results of characterization for the sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium calcined at 773 and 873 K show that the AlVO4 phase was formed at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[6] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[7] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetra- hedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

1. Research in vanadium oxide-based catalysts has evolved significantly since the 1980s, exploring them as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. Factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. 

2. At 873 K calcination, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate the catalyst structure. The polymerized species make up the majority.

3. As vanadium loadings increase up to 13.2 wt.%, the proportion of dispersed VOx species reduces, while the proportion of vanadium in the crystalline AlVO4 phase increases.

4. Despite varying vanadium loadings, the domain size of tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species remains approximately constant.

5. For a sample calcined at 773 and 873 K with 8.9 wt.% vanadium, the AlVO4 phase formation occurs at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

6. The catalytic activity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is largely determined by the quantity of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

7. Propene selectivity is influenced by the dispersion of tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; higher dispersion correlates with greater propene selectivity.

1. 自1980年代以来，对以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂的研究显著发展，它们被用作石蜡脱氢的替代品，Pt和CrOx。影响这些催化剂中范德华物种性质和行为的因素包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载。

2. 在873 K的煅烧下，分散的孤立和聚合的V5+物种在四面体协调下占主导地位，其中聚合物种占主要部分。

3. 随着钒负载量增加到13.2 wt.%，分散的VOx物种的比例减少，而结晶的AlVO4相中的钒比例增加。

4. 不管是不同的钒负载量，四面体协调聚合的V5+物种的域大小大约保持不变。

5. 对于在773和873 K下煅烧的8.9 wt.%的样品，AlVO4相的形成发生在八面体协调的V5+物种的损失上。

6. 烯烃氧化脱氢的催化活性主要由分散的孤立和聚合的四面体协调的V5+物种的数量决定。

7. 丙烯选择性受四面体协调的V5+物种的分散度的影响；更高的分散度与更高的丙烯选择性相关。
