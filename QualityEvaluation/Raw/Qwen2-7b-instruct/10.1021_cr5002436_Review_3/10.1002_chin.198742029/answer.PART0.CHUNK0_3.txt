Answer: There are no relevant quotes provided in the literature that discuss vanadium oxide-based catalysts, their alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document focuses on the synthesis of molybdenum carbide catalysts, which is unrelated to the question asked.

答案：文献中没有与范德华氧化物基催化剂、它们作为异丁烷脱氢反应中铂和CrOx的替代品，以及自1980年代以来该领域研究的发展相关的相关引文。本文档专注于钼碳化物催化剂的合成，与所问问题无关。
