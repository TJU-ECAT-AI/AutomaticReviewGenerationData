The catalytic properties of gallium and gallium oxides supported on aluminosilicates have received attention some 20 years ago owing to their activity in alkane dehydroaromatisation [23,24].
Interest for gallium oxides has been renewed recently on account of their remarkable promoting influence for carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol [25,26].

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Over the past two decades, interest in gallium oxides has been revived due to their notable enhancement of carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol processes.

自20世纪80年代以来，对以范德华氧化物为基底的催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品的研究已经取得了显著进展。研究主要集中在如何通过载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。近二十年来，对镓氧化物的兴趣再次被激发，这主要归功于它们在二氧化碳氢化为甲醇过程中的卓越促进作用。
