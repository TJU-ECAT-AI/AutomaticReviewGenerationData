[1] "Incorporation of gallium and iron into MCM-41-type silicas leads to creation of active and selective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
[2] "Fe-MCM-41 shows the best performance for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation into styrene, in particular, at 600 C, the yield over this catalyst is 38% per pass and selectivity is 82%,which corresponds to 64% of the equilibrium value."
[3] "The catalysts have been characterised by XRD, volumetry, infrared spectroscopy, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."
[4] "Catalytic activity is associated with the presence of nanoparticles of oxides, entrapped in the pores or embedded in the silica network,which generate reducible species able to split CH bonds and allow fast recombinative desorption of hydrogen and olefins."
[5] "The catalytic properties of promoted and unpromoted iron oxides are well documented, be- cause of their dehydrogenation activity and practical use, for instance in styrene production."
[6] "The study revealed a dramatic influence of the time of sample calcination on its catalytic activity."
[7] "The catalysts demonstrated a very low activity (Table 2) but unique characteristics as examplified by the data reported in Table 3, where the selectivities obtained over the four materials at nearly identical conversion levels are compared."

1. The incorporation of gallium and iron into MCM-41-type silicas creates active and selective catalysts for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. 
2. Fe-MCM-41 excels in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation into styrene, achieving a 38% yield per pass and 82% selectivity at 600°C, corresponding to 64% of the equilibrium value.
3. The catalysts' properties were assessed using XRD, volumetry, infrared spectroscopy, ammonia TPD, and TPR.
4. The presence of oxide nanoparticles, either trapped in pores or embedded in the silica matrix, generates reducible species capable of splitting CH bonds and facilitating the rapid recombinative desorption of hydrogen and olefins.
5. Iron oxides, both promoted and unpromoted, are well-documented for their dehydrogenation activity and practical applications, including styrene production.
6. The time of sample calcination significantly impacts the catalyst's activity.
7. The catalysts showed minimal activity, but each possessed unique characteristics as evidenced by the comparison of selectivities across the four materials at similar conversion levels.
