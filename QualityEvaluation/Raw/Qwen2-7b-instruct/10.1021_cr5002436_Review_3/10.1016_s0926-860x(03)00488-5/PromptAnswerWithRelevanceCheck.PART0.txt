<quotes>
The catalytic properties of gallium and gallium oxides supported on aluminosilicates have received attention some 20 years ago owing to their activity in alkane dehydroaromatisation [23,24].
Interest for gallium oxides has been renewed recently on account of their remarkable promoting influence for carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol [25,26].

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Over the past two decades, interest in gallium oxides has been revived due to their notable enhancement of carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol processes.

[1] "Incorporation of gallium and iron into MCM-41-type silicas leads to creation of active and selective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
[2] "Fe-MCM-41 shows the best performance for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation into styrene, in particular, at 600 C, the yield over this catalyst is 38% per pass and selectivity is 82%,which corresponds to 64% of the equilibrium value."
[3] "The catalysts have been characterised by XRD, volumetry, infrared spectroscopy, ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."
[4] "Catalytic activity is associated with the presence of nanoparticles of oxides, entrapped in the pores or embedded in the silica network,which generate reducible species able to split CH bonds and allow fast recombinative desorption of hydrogen and olefins."
[5] "The catalytic properties of promoted and unpromoted iron oxides are well documented, be- cause of their dehydrogenation activity and practical use, for instance in styrene production."
[6] "The study revealed a dramatic influence of the time of sample calcination on its catalytic activity."
[7] "The catalysts demonstrated a very low activity (Table 2) but unique characteristics as examplified by the data reported in Table 3, where the selectivities obtained over the four materials at nearly identical conversion levels are compared."
