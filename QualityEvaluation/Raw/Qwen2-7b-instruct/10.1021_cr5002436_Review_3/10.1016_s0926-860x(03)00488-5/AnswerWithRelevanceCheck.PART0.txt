          "The catalytic properties of gallium and gallium oxides supported on aluminosilicates have received attention some 20 years ago owing to their activity in alkane dehydroaromatisation [23,24]."
          "Interest for gallium oxides has been renewed recently on account of their remarkable promoting influence for carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol [25,26]."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Over the past two decades, interest in gallium oxides has been revived due to their notable enhancement of carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol processes.

          自20世纪80年代以来，对以V2O5为基的催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品的研究已经取得了显著进展。研究主要集中在如何通过载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。近二十年来，对镓氧化物的研究再次引起关注，主要是由于它们在二氧化碳氢化为甲醇过程中显著增强的作用。

          "The catalytic properties of promoted and unpromoted iron oxides are well documented, because of their dehydrogenation activity and practical use, for instance in styrene production."
          "The catalysts demonstrated a very low activity (Table 2) but unique characteristics as exemplified by the data reported in Table 3, where the selectivities obtained over the four materials at nearly identical conversion levels are compared."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          Iron oxides, both promoted and unpromoted, are well-established for their dehydrogenation activity and practical applications, particularly in styrene production. Despite showing minimal activity (Table 2), the catalysts displayed unique characteristics, as evidenced by the comparison of selectivities across the four materials at nearly identical conversion levels (Table 3).

          铁氧化物，无论是促进的还是未促进的，因其脱氢活性和实际应用而得到了充分的研究，尤其是在苯乙烯生产中的应用。尽管显示出了较低的活性（表2），但催化剂表现出了独特的特性，这通过比较四种材料在几乎相同的转化率水平下的选择性（表3）来体现。
