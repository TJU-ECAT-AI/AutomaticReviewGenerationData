<p>The catalytic properties of gallium and gallium oxides supported on aluminosilicates have received attention some 20 years ago owing to their activity in alkane dehydroaromatisation.</p>
<p>Interests for gallium oxides have been renewed recently on account of their remarkable promoting influence for carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol.</p>
<p>The catalytic properties of promoted and unpromoted iron oxides are well documented, because of their dehydrogenation activity and practical use, for instance in styrene production.</p>

Gallium oxides and gallium-based catalysts have been studied for alkane dehydroaromatization for about 20 years. Recently, their role in carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol has gained renewed interest due to their exceptional promotion effect. Iron oxides' catalytic properties, especially their dehydrogenation activity, are well established and widely utilized, notably in styrene production.
