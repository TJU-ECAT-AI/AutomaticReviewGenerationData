[1] "The rapidly increasing demand for MTBE (methyl- tertiary-butyl ether), because of its ability to replace lead additives in gasoline, requires new sources of isobutene, the starting material which, by addition to methanol, produces MTBE [1]."
[2] "All these processes need a preliminary step, the isomerization of the abundant n-butane into valuable isobutane."
[3] "The objective of this article is to present the catalytic activity and the physical characterization of this new material when applied to n-butane dehydrogenation [14,15]."
[4] "However, the addition of 5 Torr of steam was not sufcient and both conversion and selectivity were found in an intermediate situation when compared to dry feed and to 18 Torr of steam."
[5] "Clearly, the addition of steam to the reactant feed allowed the stabilization of the Mo oxycarbide stoichiometry (MoOxCy), with low carbon content,leading to a signicant stabilization of the dehydrogenation selectivity."
[6] "However, the deactivation due to the sintering or the recrystalliza- tion of the active phase was also observed."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and oxygen-insensitive catalysts capable of efficiently converting paraffins into olefins. Since the 1980s, research in this area has focused on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the behavior and nature of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors play crucial roles in determining the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalysts. For instance, the choice of carrier can alter the dispersion of vanadium species, affecting the surface area available for reactions. Surface area and metal loading can impact the activity of the catalysts by influencing the number of active sites and the proximity of reactants to these sites. Overall, the research aims to optimize the performance of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation by fine-tuning these parameters.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has driven by the increasing demand for MTBE, which requires new sources of isobutene. The lack of natural abundance of isobutene has led to its synthesis from crude oil fractions or natural gas. Traditional routes, such as the FCC C3C4 cut or steam cracking, do not efficiently convert the abundant n-butane into isobutene. The use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts offers the potential for higher selectivity, stability, and activity compared to Pt and CrOx. Research in this area aims to improve catalyst performance, particularly in terms of dehydrogenation activity, stability, and selectivity, and to investigate the influence of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Future work will focus on the application of these catalysts in integrated processes, enhancing their microstructure, and understanding the different carbon species present on them.

探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为异丁烯合成的替代品，以满足MTBE（甲基叔丁基醚）的需求，这种需求源于汽油中铅添加剂的替代。由于没有丰富的天然异丁烯来源，它必须从原油馏分或天然气中合成。传统的途径，如FCC C3C4切割或蒸汽裂解，对将大量正丁烷转化为异丁烯的效率不高。使用钒氧化物基催化剂具有相对于铂和CrOx提供更高的选择性、稳定性和活性的潜力。这一领域的研究旨在提高催化剂性能，特别是提高脱氢活性、稳定性和选择性，并调查载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载对钒物种性质和行为的影响。未来的工作将集中在这些催化剂在集成过程中的应用，增强它们的微观结构，以及理解附着在其上的不同碳物种。

蒸汽的引入大大稳定了催化剂的选择性，使其保持在约80%，避免了广泛的碳化。然而，蒸汽或氧气的引入导致了脱氢活性的降低，因为这有利于活性相的结块。随着氢与碳氢化合物摩尔比的下降，去活化过程变得更加显著。然而，可以通过在相同反应温度下进行短时间的氧化再生过程完全恢复失活的催化剂。

Part I. n-Butane dehydrogenation on unsupported carbon modied MoO3 (MoOxCy): effect of steam on the catalyst stability Marc J. Ledouxa,*

[1] "Along with sintering an additional deactivation due to coke formation was also observed."
[2] "The catalyst was strongly deactivated when the H2:n-butane molar ratio was decreased because of the formation of coke on the surface blocking access to the active site."
[3] "The initial conversion was lower with the fast activation but stable; the isomer selectivity (isobuta- neisobutene) was also lower probably because of the smaller amount of amorphous active oxycarbide formed by the fast activation."
[4] "The oxidation of the deactivated catalyst could be done in a couple of minutes at the reaction temperature of 823 K with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen containing 5% of oxygen."

In addition to sintering, coke formation also caused an additional deactivation. The catalyst was strongly deactivated when the hydrogen-to-n-butane molar ratio was decreased due to the formation of coke on the surface, blocking access to the active site. The initial conversion was lower with the fast activation but stable; the isomer selectivity (isobutane-isobutene) was also lower possibly because of the smaller amount of amorphous active oxycarbide formed by the fast activation. The deactivated catalyst could be oxidized in a couple of minutes at the reaction temperature of 823 K using a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen containing 5% of oxygen.

除了结块之外，焦炭形成还引起了额外的失活。当氢与n-丁烷的摩尔比降低时，由于表面形成焦炭，阻断了活性位点的访问，催化剂被强烈失活。初始转化率较低，但快激活稳定；异构选择性（异丁烷-异丁烯）也较低，可能是因为快激活形成了较少的非晶态活性氧化碳化物。失活催化剂可以在反应温度为823 K的情况下，在含氧5%的氧气和氮气混合物中几分钟内被氧化。

4.4. Hydrogen partial pressure effect on the dehydrogenation activity Because of the limitation due to heat transfer difficulties discussed above (highly endothermic reaction),the kinetics of the reaction according to butane partial pressure could not be performed accurately but the role of the hydrogen partial pressure was investigated.

The n-butane partial pressure was kept constant at 0.1 bar and hydrogen was diluted by a helium ow in order to obtain 0.9, 0.6, 0.1 and 0.05 bar of hydrogen,all other parameters being kept constant. The results are reported in Fig. 12 and it is clear that the diminu- tion of the hydrogen pressure did not affect the P C4 selectivity but strongly increased the drop in the conversion after the high initial activity.

The research has explored vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their potential to offer selectivity, stability, and activity akin to Pt-based catalysts, yet with lower cost and environmental requirements. Since the 1980s, advancements have focused on optimizing the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the literature highlights the role of steam in stabilizing the catalyst selectivity and preventing extensive carburization, while the hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratio significantly impacts deactivation processes like sintering and coke formation, affecting the dehydrogenation activity.
