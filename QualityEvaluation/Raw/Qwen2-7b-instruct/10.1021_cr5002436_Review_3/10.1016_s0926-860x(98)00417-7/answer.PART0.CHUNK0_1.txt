[1] "The rapidly increasing demand for MTBE (methyl- tertiary-butyl ether), because of its ability to replace lead additives in gasoline, requires new sources of isobutene, the starting material which, by addition to methanol, produces MTBE [1]."
[2] "There is no abundant natural source of this light olen and consequently it has to be synthesized from crude oil fractions or natural gas, the main sources of hydrocarbons."
[3] "Two routes are currently in use: the exploitation of the FCC C3C4 cut (uidized-bed catalytic cracking) or of the steam cracker and the direct dehydrogenation of iso- butane."
[4] "Unless signicant modications to the running conditions are made, the FCC C3C4 cut only contains about 10 wt% of isobutene, and the subsequent iso- merization of the n-butenes (about 2030 wt% of the C3C4) into isobutene on acidic catalysts is not very efcient."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and oxygen-insensitive catalysts capable of efficiently converting paraffins into olefins. Since the 1980s, research in this area has focused on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the behavior and nature of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors play crucial roles in determining the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalysts. For instance, the choice of carrier can alter the dispersion of vanadium species, affecting the surface area available for reactions. Surface area and metal loading can impact the activity of the catalysts by influencing the number of active sites and the proximity of reactants to these sites. Overall, the research aims to optimize the performance of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation by fine-tuning these parameters.
