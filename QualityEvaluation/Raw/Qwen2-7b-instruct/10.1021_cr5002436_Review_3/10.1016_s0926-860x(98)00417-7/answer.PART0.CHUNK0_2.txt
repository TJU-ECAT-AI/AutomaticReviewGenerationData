[1] "The rapidly increasing demand for MTBE (methyl- tertiary-butyl ether), because of its ability to replace lead additives in gasoline, requires new sources of isobutene, the starting material which, by addition to methanol, produces MTBE [1]."
[2] "There is no abundant natural source of this light olen and consequently it has to be synthesized from crude oil fractions or natural gas, the main sources of hydrocarbons."
[3] "Two routes are currently in use: the exploitation of the FCC C3C4 cut (uidized-bed catalytic cracking) or of the steam cracker and the direct dehydrogenation of iso- butane."
[4] "Unless signicant modications to the running conditions are made, the FCC C3C4 cut only contains about 10 wt% of isobutene, and the subsequent iso- merization of the n-butenes (about 2030 wt% of the C3C4) into isobutene on acidic catalysts is not very efcient."
[5] "The objective of this article is to present the catalytic activity and the physical characterization of this new material when applied to n-butane dehydrogenation [14,15]."
[6] "Future articles will be devoted to more applied research dealing with specic requirements of the integrated process and additional improvement of the catalyst and its microstructure characterization."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has driven by the increasing demand for MTBE, which requires new sources of isobutene. The lack of natural abundance of isobutene has led to its synthesis from crude oil fractions or natural gas. Traditional routes, such as the FCC C3C4 cut or steam cracking, do not efficiently convert the abundant n-butane into isobutene. The use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts offers the potential for higher selectivity, stability, and activity compared to Pt and CrOx. Research in this area aims to improve catalyst performance, particularly in terms of dehydrogenation activity, stability, and selectivity, and to investigate the influence of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Future work will focus on the application of these catalysts in integrated processes, enhancing their microstructure, and understanding the different carbon species present on them.

探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为异丁烯合成的替代品，以满足MTBE（甲基叔丁基醚）的需求，这种需求源于汽油中铅添加剂的替代。由于没有丰富的天然异丁烯来源，它必须从原油馏分或天然气中合成。传统的途径，如FCC C3C4切割或蒸汽裂解，对将大量正丁烷转化为异丁烯的效率不高。使用钒氧化物基催化剂具有相对于铂和CrOx提供更高的选择性、稳定性和活性的潜力。这一领域的研究旨在提高催化剂性能，特别是提高脱氢活性、稳定性和选择性，并调查载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载对钒物种性质和行为的影响。未来的工作将集中在这些催化剂在集成过程中的应用，增强它们的微观结构，以及理解附着在其上的不同碳物种。
