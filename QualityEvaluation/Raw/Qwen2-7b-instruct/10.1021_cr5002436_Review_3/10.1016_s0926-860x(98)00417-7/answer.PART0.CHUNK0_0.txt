[1] "The rapidly increasing demand for MTBE (methyl- tertiary-butyl ether), because of its ability to replace lead additives in gasoline, requires new sources of isobutene, the starting material which, by addition to methanol, produces MTBE [1]."
[2] "All these processes need a preliminary step, the isomerization of the abundant n-butane into valuable isobutane."
[3] "The objective of this article is to present the catalytic activity and the physical characterization of this new material when applied to n-butane dehydrogenation [14,15]."
[4] "However, the addition of 5 Torr of steam was not sufcient and both conversion and selectivity were found in an intermediate situation when compared to dry feed and to 18 Torr of steam."
[5] "Clearly, the addition of steam to the reactant feed allowed the stabilization of the Mo oxycarbide stoichiometry (MoOxCy), with low carbon content,leading to a signicant stabilization of the dehydrogenation selectivity."
[6] "However, the deactivation due to the sintering or the recrystalliza- tion of the active phase was also observed."

1. The increasing demand for MTBE, driven by its use in gasoline as a lead replacement, necessitates new sources of isobutene, which is obtained through the isomerization of abundant n-butane.
2. The dehydrogenation of isobutane is a critical step in the production of MTBE.
3. The aim of the article is to showcase the catalytic activity and physical properties of a newly developed material when applied to the dehydrogenation of n-butane.
4. The addition of 5 Torr of steam did not significantly stabilize the catalyst, resulting in intermediate conversion and selectivity levels compared to the dry feed and 18 Torr of steam.
5. Adding steam to the reactant feed stabilizes the Mo oxycarbide, lowering its carbon content and significantly stabilizing the dehydrogenation selectivity.
6. The catalyst experienced deactivation due to sintering or recrystallization of the active phase, despite the stabilizing effect of steam.

1. MTBE需求的迅速增长，由于其作为汽油中铅替代物的能力，需要新的异丁烯来源，这是通过将甲醇添加到异丁烯中生成MTBE的基础。
2. 异丁烯的脱氢是生产MTBE过程中的关键步骤。
3. 文章的目标是展示在n-丁烷脱氢应用中新型材料的催化活性和物理特性。
4. 添加5 Torr蒸汽未能显著稳定催化剂，导致与干燥饲料和18 Torr蒸汽相比，转化率和选择性处于中间水平。
5. 将蒸汽加入反应物流中，可以稳定Mo氧化碳化物，降低其碳含量，显著稳定脱氢选择性。
6. 虽然蒸汽具有稳定作用，但催化剂仍因活性相的聚集或再结晶而发生失活。
