Part I. n-Butane dehydrogenation on unsupported carbon modied MoO3 (MoOxCy): effect of steam on the catalyst stability Marc J. Ledouxa,*

[1] "The introduction of steam into the feed largely stabilized the catalyst selectivity at around 80% by avoiding the extensive carburization."
[2] "However, the introduction of steam or oxygen led to a lower dehydrogenation activity by favoring the active phase sintering."
[3] "This latter deactivation process becomes more pronounced as the hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratio decreased."
[4] "However, the deactivated catalyst can be totally recovered by applying a short oxidative regeneration process at the same reaction temperature."

蒸汽的引入大大稳定了催化剂的选择性，使其保持在约80%，避免了广泛的碳化。然而，蒸汽或氧气的引入导致了脱氢活性的降低，因为这有利于活性相的结块。随着氢与碳氢化合物摩尔比的下降，去活化过程变得更加显著。然而，可以通过在相同反应温度下进行短时间的氧化再生过程完全恢复失活的催化剂。

Part I. n-Butane dehydrogenation on unsupported carbon modied MoO3 (MoOxCy): effect of steam on the catalyst stability Marc J. Ledouxa,*

[1] "Along with sintering an additional deactivation due to coke formation was also observed."
[2] "The catalyst was strongly deactivated when the H2:n-butane molar ratio was decreased because of the formation of coke on the surface blocking access to the active site."
[3] "The initial conversion was lower with the fast activation but stable; the isomer selectivity (isobuta- neisobutene) was also lower probably because of the smaller amount of amorphous active oxycarbide formed by the fast activation."
[4] "The oxidation of the deactivated catalyst could be done in a couple of minutes at the reaction temperature of 823 K with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen containing 5% of oxygen."

In addition to sintering, coke formation also caused an additional deactivation. The catalyst was strongly deactivated when the hydrogen-to-n-butane molar ratio was decreased due to the formation of coke on the surface, blocking access to the active site. The initial conversion was lower with the fast activation but stable; the isomer selectivity (isobutane-isobutene) was also lower possibly because of the smaller amount of amorphous active oxycarbide formed by the fast activation. The deactivated catalyst could be oxidized in a couple of minutes at the reaction temperature of 823 K using a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen containing 5% of oxygen.

除了结块之外，焦炭形成还引起了额外的失活。当氢与n-丁烷的摩尔比降低时，由于表面形成焦炭，阻断了活性位点的访问，催化剂被强烈失活。初始转化率较低，但快激活稳定；异构选择性（异丁烷-异丁烯）也较低，可能是因为快激活形成了较少的非晶态活性氧化碳化物。失活催化剂可以在反应温度为823 K的情况下，在含氧5%的氧气和氮气混合物中几分钟内被氧化。
