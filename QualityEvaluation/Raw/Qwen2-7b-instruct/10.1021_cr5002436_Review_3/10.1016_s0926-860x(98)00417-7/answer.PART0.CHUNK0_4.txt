Part I. n-Butane dehydrogenation on unsupported carbon modied MoO3 (MoOxCy): effect of steam on the catalyst stability Marc J. Ledouxa,*

...The introduction of steam into the feed largely stabilized the catalyst selectivity at around 80% by avoiding the extensive carburization.

However, the introduction of steam or oxygen led to a lower dehydrogenation activity by favoring the active phase sintering.

Along with sintering an additional deactivation due to coke formation was also observed.

This latter deactivation process becomes more pronounced as the hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratio decreased.

However, the deactivated catalyst can be totally recovered by applying a short oxidative regeneration process at the same reaction temperature.

4.4. Hydrogen partial pressure effect on the dehydrogenation activity Because of the limitation due to heat transfer difficulties discussed above (highly endothermic reaction),the kinetics of the reaction according to butane partial pressure could not be performed accurately but the role of the hydrogen partial pressure was investigated.

The n-butane partial pressure was kept constant at 0.1 bar and hydrogen was diluted by a helium ow in order to obtain 0.9, 0.6, 0.1 and 0.05 bar of hydrogen,all other parameters being kept constant. The results are reported in Fig. 12 and it is clear that the diminu- tion of the hydrogen pressure did not affect the P C4 selectivity but strongly increased the drop in the conversion after the high initial activity.

The research has explored vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their potential to offer selectivity, stability, and activity akin to Pt-based catalysts, yet with lower cost and environmental requirements. Since the 1980s, advancements have focused on optimizing the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the literature highlights the role of steam in stabilizing the catalyst selectivity and preventing extensive carburization, while the hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratio significantly impacts deactivation processes like sintering and coke formation, affecting the dehydrogenation activity.

自1980年代以来，研究探索了以钒氧化物为基础的催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品，原因在于它们有可能提供与Pt基催化剂相媲美的选择性、稳定性和活性，同时具有更低的成本和环境要求。这一领域的进展集中在优化载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载，以增强这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。文献指出蒸汽在维持催化剂选择性和防止过度碳化方面的作用，而氢气与烃类分子的摩尔比显著影响如聚集和焦炭形成等失活过程，从而影响脱氢活性。
