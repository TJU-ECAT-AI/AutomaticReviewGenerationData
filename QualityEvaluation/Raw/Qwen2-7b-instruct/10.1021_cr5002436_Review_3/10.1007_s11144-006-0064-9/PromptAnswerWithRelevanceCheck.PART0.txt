[1] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ZrO2."
[2] "High activity of the VOx/Cact, VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2 and VOx/ZnO can be associated with their lowest initial temperature of reduction."
[3] "Consequntly, the low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K (the temperature used for the isobutane dehydrogenation tests) gives the catalysts with low activity."
[4] "The highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."
[5] "Another though undesirable effect of acidity, is the formation of small amounts of the isomerization products (selectivity up to 3%)."
[6] "The results obtained show that CO2 enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction carried out over VOx/Cact catalyst. Opposite trend is observed when vanadium is supported on the ZnO and Al2O3 surface, what can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength - the catalyst surface can be partially blocked for the isobutane by adsorbed carbon dioxide."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to reduce costs and environmental impacts associated with traditional catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several factors, including the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Specifically, the catalyst's activity and selectivity are affected by the reducibility of the vanadium oxide, which in turn depends on the initial temperature of reduction and the nature of the support material. Catalysts with higher initial reduction temperatures tend to have lower activity. The acidity of the catalyst surface plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of isobutane, enhancing activity over certain catalysts like VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3. However, this acidity can also lead to the formation of undesired isomerization products. The presence of carbon dioxide in the reaction mixture tends to enhance the activity of VOx/Cact catalysts, while it has an opposite effect on catalysts supported on zinc oxide and aluminum oxide surfaces due to the blocking of the catalyst surface by adsorbed carbon dioxide.

对于正构烷烃脱氢的铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代，探索范德华氧化物基催化剂的驱动力在于降低与传统催化剂相关联的成本和环境影响。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点是优化催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。这些催化剂中钒物种的性质受到载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等几个因素的影响。具体而言，催化剂的活性和选择性受钒氧化物的可还原性影响，这反过来又取决于还原起始温度和支持材料的性质。具有较高还原起始温度的催化剂往往活性较低。催化剂表面的酸性在异丁烷脱氢过程中扮演着关键角色，提高了VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3等催化剂的活性。然而，这种酸性也可能导致不希望的异构化产物的形成。二氧化碳在反应混合物中的存在倾向于增强VOx/Cact催化剂的活性，而在锌氧化物和铝氧化物表面上的催化剂则显示出相反的效果，这是由于吸附的二氧化碳阻塞了催化剂表面。

[1] "The great demand for olefins as a feedstock for industrial processes is the reason why the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is an important commercial process."
[2] "For example, in 1996 about 1.93 million tons of isobutene were consumed in Western Europe, not including refinery operations such as alkylation and polymerization."
[3] "Moreover, isobutene is polymerized or copolymerized to polyisobutylene and butyl rubber (about 28% of total demand), and is used for impact-resistant and antioxidant additives for plastics, and in many other applications."
[4] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]."
[5] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts."

[7] "The opposite trend was observed over alumina supported vanadium oxide,where the isobutane conversion in the carbon dioxide atmosphere was much lower than that in the inert gas flow (13.2% and 26.2% respectively)."
[8] "The initial temperature of the H2 uptake is around 500-600 K for the most active catalysts,while the Tmax position is increasing in the sequence Cact<ZnO<TiO2<Al2O3 <ZrO2<SiO2 <La2O3<CeO2, which is in agreement with the earlier report [12]."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the significant demand for olefins in industrial processes. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the optimization of catalyst performance through the adjustment of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. The presence of carbon dioxide can enhance the isobutane conversion in reactions carried out over certain vanadium oxide catalysts, such as those supported on carbon (Cact) or aluminum oxide (Al2O3). However, for other supports like zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide, carbon dioxide may block the catalyst surface, leading to decreased activity. The reducibility of the catalysts, which is influenced by the nature of the support and vanadium loading, plays a crucial role in determining their activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The results show that the activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2. The high activity of the first four catalysts correlates with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. The high activity of the most active catalysts (VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3) is associated with their considerable acidity, which likely relates to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface. However, this acidity can lead to the formation of small amounts of isomerization products, which is an undesirable effect.

Carbon dioxide enhances isobutane conversion in reactions carried out over VOx/Cact catalysts. However, opposite trends are observed when vanadium is supported on zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) surfaces. This can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength, which can partially block the catalyst surface for isobutane, affecting its reactivity.

探索以二氧化钒为基的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，是由于对烯烃的工业过程需求巨大。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展起来，重点是通过调整载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载来优化催化剂性能。这些变量影响了催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。碳二**氧化物的存在可以增强在某些二氧化钒催化剂中进行的异丁烷脱氢反应的异丁烯产率，如在碳（Cact）或氧化铝（Al2O3）上支持的催化剂。然而，在其他支持物如氧化锌（ZnO）和氧化铝（Al2O3）中，二氧化碳可能会阻塞催化剂表面，导致活性降低。

催化剂的还原性受到支持物性质和钒负载的影响，对于脱氢反应来说至关重要。结果表明，支持的二氧化钒催化剂的活性按以下顺序递减：Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2。前四种高活性催化剂的高活性与它们能够在较低温度下还原的能力有关。最活跃的催化剂（VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3）的高活性与它们显著的酸性相关，这可能与异丁烷吸附在催化剂表面上有关。然而，这种酸性会导致少量异构化产物的形成，这是不希望有的效果。

二氧化碳增强了在VOx/Cact催化剂上进行的异丁烷转化。然而，在氧化锌（ZnO）和氧化铝（Al2O3）上支持的钒催化剂中观察到相反的趋势。这可以解释为存在中等强度的基本站点，可能会部分阻塞催化剂表面，影响异丁烷的反应性。

活性的提高与它们在较低温度下还原的能力有关。最活跃的催化剂（VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3）的高活性与它们的显著酸性相关，这可能与异丁烷在催化剂表面的吸附有关。然而，这种酸性会导致少量异构化产物的形成，这是不希望有的效果。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the catalyst's structure, particularly the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. For instance, the carrier type, such as carbonaceous (Cact), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon dioxide (SiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), lanthanum oxide (La2O3), cerium oxide (CeO2), titanium oxide (TiO2), and zirconium oxide (ZrO2), affects the catalyst's reactivity. Specifically, the catalysts' ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures correlates with their activity. The presence of basic sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface can block the isobutane, leading to a decrease in activity when vanadium is supported on zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). However, carbon dioxide (CO2) enhances the isobutane conversion in reactions over the vanadium oxide/carbonaceous (VOx/Cact) catalyst.

对铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)作为石蜡脱氢催化剂的替代品的探索，主要是出于更高效和成本效益更高的催化剂的需求。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经显著发展，特别关注优化催化剂结构，包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等。这些因素影响了在催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，载体类型（如碳质（Cact）、氧化铝（Al2O3）、二氧化硅（SiO2）、氧化锌（ZnO）、镧系氧化物（La2O3）、铈氧化物（CeO2）、二氧化钛（TiO2）和氧化锆（ZrO2））影响催化剂的活性。具体来说，催化剂在较低温度下进行还原的能力与它们的活性有关。在氧化锌（ZnO）和氧化铝（Al2O3）上负载的钒的存在导致基本强度中等的基本位点存在于催化剂表面，这可能阻碍异丁烷，从而降低活性。然而，二氧化碳（CO2）可以增强在碳氧化物/钒氧化物（VOx/Cact）催化剂反应中的异丁烷转化率。
