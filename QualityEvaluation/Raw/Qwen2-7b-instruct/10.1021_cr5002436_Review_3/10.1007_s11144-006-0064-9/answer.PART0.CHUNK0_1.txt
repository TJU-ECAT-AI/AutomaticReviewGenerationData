[1] "The great demand for olefins as a feedstock for industrial processes is the reason why the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is an important commercial process."
[2] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]."
[3] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts."
[4] "The highest isobutene yield reported in the literature (32.6%) for the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide was obtained over K-Cr-MnO/SiO2, but the temperature of the process was 923 K [6]."
[5] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the high demand for olefins in industrial processes. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on catalyst design that improves efficiency and reduces costs. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Specifically, catalysts with higher surface areas and lower initial reduction temperatures tend to exhibit better activity. Variables like acidity and the presence of basic sites can also affect catalyst performance.
