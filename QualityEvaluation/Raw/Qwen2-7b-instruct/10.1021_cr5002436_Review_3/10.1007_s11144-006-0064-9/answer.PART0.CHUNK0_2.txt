[1] "The great demand for olefins as a feedstock for industrial processes is the reason why the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is an important commercial process."
[2] "For example, in 1996 about 1.93 million tons of isobutene were consumed in Western Europe, not including refinery operations such as alkylation and polymerization."
[3] "Moreover, isobutene is polymerized or copolymerized to polyisobutylene and butyl rubber (about 28% of total demand), and is used for impact-resistant and antioxidant additives for plastics, and in many other applications."
[4] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]."
[5] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts."
[6] "The highest isobutene yield reported in the literature (32.6%) for the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide was obtained over K-Cr-MnO/SiO2, but the temperature of the process was 923 K [6]."
[7] "The opposite trend was observed over alumina supported vanadium oxide,where the isobutane conversion in the carbon dioxide atmosphere was much lower than that in the inert gas flow (13.2% and 26.2% respectively)."
[8] "The initial temperature of the H2 uptake is around 500-600 K for the most active catalysts,while the Tmax position is increasing in the sequence Cact<ZnO<TiO2<Al2O3 <ZrO2<SiO2 <La2O3<CeO2, which is in agreement with the earlier report [12]."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the significant demand for olefins in industrial processes. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the optimization of catalyst performance through the adjustment of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. The presence of carbon dioxide can enhance the isobutane conversion in reactions carried out over certain vanadium oxide catalysts, such as those supported on carbon (Cact) or aluminum oxide (Al2O3). However, for other supports like zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide, carbon dioxide may block the catalyst surface, leading to decreased activity. The reducibility of the catalysts, which is influenced by the nature of the support and vanadium loading, plays a crucial role in determining their activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The results show that the activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2. The high activity of the first four catalysts correlates with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. The high activity of the most active catalysts (VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3) is associated with their considerable acidity, which likely relates to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface. However, this acidity can lead to the formation of small amounts of isomerization products, which is an undesirable effect.

Carbon dioxide enhances isobutane conversion in reactions carried out over VOx/Cact catalysts. However, opposite trends are observed when vanadium is supported on zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) surfaces. This can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength, which can partially block the catalyst surface for isobutane, affecting its reactivity.

探索以二氧化钒为基的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，是由于对烯烃的工业过程需求巨大。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展起来，重点是通过调整载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载来优化催化剂性能。这些变量影响了催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。碳二**氧化物的存在可以增强在某些二氧化钒催化剂中进行的异丁烷脱氢反应的异丁烯产率，如在碳（Cact）或氧化铝（Al2O3）上支持的催化剂。然而，在其他支持物如氧化锌（ZnO）和氧化铝（Al2O3）中，二氧化碳可能会阻塞催化剂表面，导致活性降低。

催化剂的还原性受到支持物性质和钒负载的影响，对于脱氢反应来说至关重要。结果表明，支持的二氧化钒催化剂的活性按以下顺序递减：Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 > ZrO2。前四种高活性催化剂的高活性与它们能够在较低温度下还原的能力有关。最活跃的催化剂（VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3）的高活性与它们显著的酸性相关，这可能与异丁烷吸附在催化剂表面上有关。然而，这种酸性会导致少量异构化产物的形成，这是不希望有的效果。

二氧化碳增强了在VOx/Cact催化剂上进行的异丁烷转化。然而，在氧化锌（ZnO）和氧化铝（Al2O3）上支持的钒催化剂中观察到相反的趋势。这可以解释为存在中等强度的基本站点，可能会部分阻塞催化剂表面，影响异丁烷的反应性。

活性的提高与它们在较低温度下还原的能力有关。最活跃的催化剂（VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3）的高活性与它们的显著酸性相关，这可能与异丁烷在催化剂表面的吸附有关。然而，这种酸性会导致少量异构化产物的形成，这是不希望有的效果。
