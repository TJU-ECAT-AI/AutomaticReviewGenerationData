[1] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ZrO2."
[2] "High activity of the VOx/Cact, VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2 and VOx/ZnO can be associated with their lowest initial temperature of reduction."
[3] "Consequntly, the low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K (the temperature used for the isobutane dehydrogenation tests) gives the catalysts with low activity."
[4] "The highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."
[5] "Another though undesirable effect of acidity, is the formation of small amounts of the isomerization products (selectivity up to 3%)."
[6] "The results obtained show that CO2 enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction carried out over VOx/Cact catalyst. Opposite trend is observed when vanadium is supported on the ZnO and Al2O3 surface, what can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength - the catalyst surface can be partially blocked for the isobutane by adsorbed carbon dioxide."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to reduce costs and environmental impacts associated with traditional catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several factors, including the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Specifically, the catalyst's activity and selectivity are affected by the reducibility of the vanadium oxide, which in turn depends on the initial temperature of reduction and the nature of the support material. Catalysts with higher initial reduction temperatures tend to have lower activity. The acidity of the catalyst surface plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of isobutane, enhancing activity over certain catalysts like VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3. However, this acidity can also lead to the formation of undesired isomerization products. The presence of carbon dioxide in the reaction mixture tends to enhance the activity of VOx/Cact catalysts, while it has an opposite effect on catalysts supported on zinc oxide and aluminum oxide surfaces due to the blocking of the catalyst surface by adsorbed carbon dioxide.

对于正构烷烃脱氢的铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代，探索范德华氧化物基催化剂的驱动力在于降低与传统催化剂相关联的成本和环境影响。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点是优化催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。这些催化剂中钒物种的性质受到载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等几个因素的影响。具体而言，催化剂的活性和选择性受钒氧化物的可还原性影响，这反过来又取决于还原起始温度和支持材料的性质。具有较高还原起始温度的催化剂往往活性较低。催化剂表面的酸性在异丁烷脱氢过程中扮演着关键角色，提高了VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3等催化剂的活性。然而，这种酸性也可能导致不希望的异构化产物的形成。二氧化碳在反应混合物中的存在倾向于增强VOx/Cact催化剂的活性，而在锌氧化物和铝氧化物表面上的催化剂则显示出相反的效果，这是由于吸附的二氧化碳阻塞了催化剂表面。
