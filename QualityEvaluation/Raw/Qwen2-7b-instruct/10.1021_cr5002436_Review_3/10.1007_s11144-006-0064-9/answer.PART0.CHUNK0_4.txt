[1] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ZrO2."
[2] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures."
[3] "Consequntly, the low reducibility of VOx/La2O3 and VOx/CeO2 at 873 K (the temperature used for the isobutane dehydrogenation tests) gives the catalysts with low activity."
[4] "The results obtained show that CO2 enhances isobutane conversion in the reaction carried out over VOx/Cact catalyst."
[5] "Opposite trend is observed when vanadium is supported on the ZnO and Al2O3 surface, what can be explained by the presence of basic sites of medium strength - the catalyst surface can be partially blocked for the isobutane by adsorbed carbon dioxide."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the catalyst's structure, particularly the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. For instance, the carrier type, such as carbonaceous (Cact), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon dioxide (SiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), lanthanum oxide (La2O3), cerium oxide (CeO2), titanium oxide (TiO2), and zirconium oxide (ZrO2), affects the catalyst's reactivity. Specifically, the catalysts' ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures correlates with their activity. The presence of basic sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface can block the isobutane, leading to a decrease in activity when vanadium is supported on zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). However, carbon dioxide (CO2) enhances the isobutane conversion in reactions over the vanadium oxide/carbonaceous (VOx/Cact) catalyst.

对铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)作为石蜡脱氢催化剂的替代品的探索，主要是出于更高效和成本效益更高的催化剂的需求。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经显著发展，特别关注优化催化剂结构，包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等。这些因素影响了在催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，载体类型（如碳质（Cact）、氧化铝（Al2O3）、二氧化硅（SiO2）、氧化锌（ZnO）、镧系氧化物（La2O3）、铈氧化物（CeO2）、二氧化钛（TiO2）和氧化锆（ZrO2））影响催化剂的活性。具体来说，催化剂在较低温度下进行还原的能力与它们的活性有关。在氧化锌（ZnO）和氧化铝（Al2O3）上负载的钒的存在导致基本强度中等的基本位点存在于催化剂表面，这可能阻碍异丁烷，从而降低活性。然而，二氧化碳（CO2）可以增强在碳氧化物/钒氧化物（VOx/Cact）催化剂反应中的异丁烷转化率。
