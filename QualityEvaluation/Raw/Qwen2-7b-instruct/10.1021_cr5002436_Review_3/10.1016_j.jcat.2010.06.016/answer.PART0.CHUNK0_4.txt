<p>Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]. Such materials are hydrothermally stable and are capable of dispersing small Pt particles due to the presence of Al cations at the support surface [10]. The basic character of the support is also desirable, since it minimizes coke formation.</p>
<p>Several investigators have shown, though, that in the absence of a promoter, Pt supported on Mg(Al)O and other supports have poor alkene selectivity and accumulate coke rapidly due to readsorption of the alkene on the Pt surface [8,1118]. High alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18].</p>
<p>Hydrotalcites were prepared with Ga cations substituting for Al, i.e., Mg(Ga)(Al)O following the procedure described in [19]. When Pt was dispersed on these materials and reduced at 873 K, Ga3+ cat ions present at the surface of the support were reduced to Ga atoms, which then formed PtGa alloys with the dispersed Pt nanoparticles. The presence of such alloys was confirmed by EXAFS, STEM-EDX, and high-resolution TEM.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research in this field has focused on improving the nature and behavior of vanadium species within catalysts through various methods. Key factors influencing the performance of these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, the presence of aluminum cations in magnesium oxide (MgO) supports enhances the dispersion of platinum (Pt) particles, contributing to better catalytic activity and selectivity. Moreover, promoters like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), and germanium (Ge) have been introduced to achieve high alkene selectivity, minimize coke formation, and improve overall catalyst activity. The substitution of aluminum (Al) with gallium (Ga) in hydrotalcite-like structures results in the formation of PtGa alloys upon reduction, which is confirmed through various analytical techniques. This modification leads to improved performance in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

自1980年代以来，对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品在烷烃脱氢中的应用进行了大量研究。该领域的研究重点是通过多种方法改进催化剂中钒物种的性质。影响这些催化剂性能的关键因素包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载量。例如，镁氧化物（MgO）支持中的铝离子的存在有助于铂（Pt）颗粒的分散，从而提高催化活性和选择性。此外，锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）和锗（Ge）等促进剂的引入能够实现高烯烃选择性、减少焦炭形成以及提高整体催化剂活性。在类似水滑石结构中用镓（Ga）替换铝（Al）导致在还原过程中形成PtGa合金，这一结论通过各种分析技术得到证实。这种修改使烷烃脱氢过程表现出更好的性能。
