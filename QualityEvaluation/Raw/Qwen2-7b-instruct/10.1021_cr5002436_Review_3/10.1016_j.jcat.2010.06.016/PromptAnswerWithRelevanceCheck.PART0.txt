Catalyst performance of novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation Georges Siddiqi, Pingping Sun, Vladimir Galvita, Alexis T.

Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge- nation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.
Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.

本文研究了新型Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的性能。催化剂性能与支持物中Ga含量密切相关。乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活性峰值出现在Ga/Pt比为1.45.4时。向原料气中添加氢气导致活性峰值出现，相对于烷烃而言。镓的存在抑制了焦炭的形成，导致了与传统双金属催化剂相比更低的失活和焦炭形成。丙烷脱氢过程中较高的Pt覆盖度是由来源于丙烷的焦炭前体导致的，这是导致丙烷脱氢过程中较高失活水平的原因之一。

Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.
The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane. 

The deactivation of the catalysts was calculated by comparing the percentage change in alkene concentration at the outlet between 1 and 120 min time on stream: Dalkene alkene1 min alkene120 min=alkene1 min 100%

The ratio of hydrogen to ethane partial pressure in the feed was varied from 0 to 2.5, while maintaining the total flow constant by appropriate addition of He. Experiments conducted with the empty reactor showed that the conversion of ethane and propane was less than 0.05% at 893 K.

The selectivity to ethene was determined from Eq. (1) and the selectivity to propene was determined from Eq. (2):
SC2H4 % C2H4=C2H4 0:5CH4 100%
1
SC3H6 % C3H6=C3H6 2=3C2H4 1=3CH4
2=3C2H6 100%

The activity, selectivity, deactivation, and carbon formation after 2 h TOS is presented in Table 1 for Pt, PtSn, and PtGa supported on Mg(Al)O) and for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O. For ethane dehydroge- nation, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, PtSn/Mg(Al)O, and PtGa/Mg(Al)O display comparable activity, selectivity, and deactivation; however, the deposition of coke is 50% less than that observed for the other three catalysts.

The effects of time on stream on the activity and selectivity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Al)O for propane dehydrogenation are presented in Fig. 6. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O exhibit an initial propene activ- ity that is about 2.5 higher than that of Pt/Mg(Al)O. However, after 2 h TOS, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O loses 30% of its initial activity and Pt/ Mg(Al)O looses 40% of its original activity, a significantly higher extent of deactivation than was observed during ethane dehydro- genation.

The effects of reductionreactionoxidation cycles on catalyst activity during ethane and propane dehydrogenation.
For ethane dehydrogenation, there is a slight increase in activity compared to the first cycle after the second, but a decrease in activ- ity in the following third cycle. The loss in activity between the first and third cycles at 120 min TOS is 2.1%.

The observation of a maximum in catalyst activity with increas- ing Ga/Pt ratio very likely reflects the influence of a monotonic de- crease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused by the presence of Ga atoms at the catalyst surface.

The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.

The effects of H2/C3H8 ratio on the rate of propene formation and the propene selectivity. The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25. Unlike the case of ethene dehydrogenation, the product concentration of propene does not approach that predicted for equilibrium conversion of the feed. The H2/C3H8 ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene pro- duced by ethane dehydrogenation.

For ethane dehydrogenation, there is a slight increase in activity compared to the first cycle after the second, but a decrease in activ- ity in the following third cycle. The loss in activity between the first and third cycles at 120 min TOS is 2.1%. For propane dehydrogena- tion, the trend changes to a constant decrease in activity with re- peated cycles, the loss in activity between the first and third cycles after 120 min TOS amounting to 14.8%.

The loss in activity for ethane dehydrogenation after 2 h on stream was minimal (3%) in the case of Pt, PtSn, and PtGa supported on Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Ga)(A- l)O but much more significant in the case of propane dehydrogena- tion (2545%).

The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation be- tween loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation.

The loss in activity due to sintering of the metal particles is likely minimal.

The amount of CO chemisorbed before and after alkane dehydro- genation for 2 h was measured for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O (Ga/Pt = 5.4) in an attempt to determine the loss in active sites. The data in Table 2 show after ethane 44% sites capable of CO chemisorption are lost after ethane dehydrogenation, but 98% of such sites are lost after propane dehydrogenation.

We hypothesize that coke not only alters the number of sites for CO adsorption, but also decreases the heat of CO adsorption. Consistent with the latter idea, CO adsorption experiments on Pt(1 1 1), (5 5 7) and (13, 1, 1) surfaces before and after hydrocar- bon reaction have shown that there is a decrease in the CO desorption temperature after hydrocarbon reaction, indicating that the deposited carbonaceous species weaken the binding of CO.

1. 活化催化剂的性能计算通过比较在第一分钟和第120分钟后流出物中烯烃浓度的变化百分比来完成：Dalkene = alkene1 min - alkene120 min/alkene1 min × 100%。

2. 将氢气与乙烷的分压比例从0变化到2.5，同时通过适当添加He保持总流量恒定。在空反应器实验中显示，在893 K时，乙烷和丙烷的转化率小于0.05%。

3. 乙烷的选择性用方程（1）确定，丙烯的选择性用方程（2）确定：
SC2H4 % = C2H4/C2H4 × 0.5CH4 × 100%

SC3H6 % = C3H6/C3H6 × 2/3C2H4 × 1/3CH4

4. 对于丙烷脱氢，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在2小时内的时间流下活性损失了30%，而Pt/Mg(Al)O催化剂则损失了40%，这比乙烷脱氢的活性损失要高得多。

5. 添加氢气到进料中导致丙烯形成速率增加到H2/C3H8比例为1.25。与乙烷脱氢的情况不同，产物的丙烯浓度并没有接近预测的均衡转换量。H2/C3H8的比例对丙烯选择性的影响比对由乙烷脱氢产生的乙烯选择性的影响更大。

This study investigates the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide. The catalyst's performance is highly dependent on the Ga content in the support, with a peak activity observed at a Ga/Pt ratio of 1.45.4 for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The selectivity increases monotonically with the Ga/Pt ratio, reaching nearly 100% at a ratio of 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed enhances the dehydrogenation rate, particularly due to hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane, and no direct correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The extent of deactivation was lower for propane than ethane, yet the amount of coke deposited was higher in the case of ethane. The higher deactivation observed in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane. Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke exceeds the exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles. The introduction of hydrogen to the feed increases the dehydrogenation rate until a certain H2/alkane ratio, after which the rate decreases monotonically.

本研究考察了在Mg(Ga)(Al)O混合氧化物上支持的Pt催化剂对乙烷和丙烷的脱氢作用。催化剂的性能高度依赖于支持物中的Ga含量，对于乙烷和丙烷脱氢，在Ga/Pt比率为1.45.4时观察到峰值活性。选择性随Ga/Pt比率的增加而单调增加，达到近100%的比率约为5.4。向反应物中添加氢气可以提高脱氢速率，特别是由于氢原子协助脱氢烷基物种形成的脱氢作用，这些物种是在解离吸附反应物烷烃后形成的。与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭较少，并且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的直接相关性。对于丙烷脱氢，失活程度低于乙烷，但沉积的焦炭量更高。在丙烷脱氢中观察到更高的失活是由于丙烷衍生的Pt覆盖层中焦炭前体的覆盖率更高。由于沉积的碳量超过暴露的Pt，可以得出结论，大部分焦炭位于支持物上而不是位于Pt颗粒上。将氢气引入反应物中可以提高脱氢速率，直到某个H2/烷烃比值，之后该速率呈单调下降趋势。

<p>Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]. Such materials are hydrothermally stable and are capable of dispersing small Pt particles due to the presence of Al cations at the support surface [10]. The basic character of the support is also desirable, since it minimizes coke formation.</p>
<p>Several investigators have shown, though, that in the absence of a promoter, Pt supported on Mg(Al)O and other supports have poor alkene selectivity and accumulate coke rapidly due to readsorption of the alkene on the Pt surface [8,1118]. High alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18].</p>
<p>Hydrotalcites were prepared with Ga cations substituting for Al, i.e., Mg(Ga)(Al)O following the procedure described in [19]. When Pt was dispersed on these materials and reduced at 873 K, Ga3+ cat ions present at the surface of the support were reduced to Ga atoms, which then formed PtGa alloys with the dispersed Pt nanoparticles. The presence of such alloys was confirmed by EXAFS, STEM-EDX, and high-resolution TEM.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research in this field has focused on improving the nature and behavior of vanadium species within catalysts through various methods. Key factors influencing the performance of these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. For instance, the presence of aluminum cations in magnesium oxide (MgO) supports enhances the dispersion of platinum (Pt) particles, contributing to better catalytic activity and selectivity. Moreover, promoters like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), and germanium (Ge) have been introduced to achieve high alkene selectivity, minimize coke formation, and improve overall catalyst activity. The substitution of aluminum (Al) with gallium (Ga) in hydrotalcite-like structures results in the formation of PtGa alloys upon reduction, which is confirmed through various analytical techniques. This modification leads to improved performance in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

自1980年代以来，对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品在烷烃脱氢中的应用进行了大量研究。该领域的研究重点是通过多种方法改进催化剂中钒物种的性质。影响这些催化剂性能的关键因素包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载量。例如，镁氧化物（MgO）支持中的铝离子的存在有助于铂（Pt）颗粒的分散，从而提高催化活性和选择性。此外，锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）和锗（Ge）等促进剂的引入能够实现高烯烃选择性、减少焦炭形成以及提高整体催化剂活性。在类似水滑石结构中用镓（Ga）替换铝（Al）导致在还原过程中形成PtGa合金，这一结论通过各种分析技术得到证实。这种修改使烷烃脱氢过程表现出更好的性能。
