<p>The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support was investigated. Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4.</p>
<p>The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane.</p>
<p>Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.</p>
<p>The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.</p>
<p>Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.</p>
<p>When H2 was added to the feed, the rate of alkene formation increased up to a certain H2/alkane ratio. Above this ratio, the rate of alkene formation decreased monotonically.</p>

This study investigates the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide. The catalyst's performance is highly dependent on the Ga content in the support, with a peak activity observed at a Ga/Pt ratio of 1.45.4 for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The selectivity increases monotonically with the Ga/Pt ratio, reaching nearly 100% at a ratio of 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed enhances the dehydrogenation rate, particularly due to hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane, and no direct correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The extent of deactivation was lower for propane than ethane, yet the amount of coke deposited was higher in the case of ethane. The higher deactivation observed in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane. Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke exceeds the exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles. The introduction of hydrogen to the feed increases the dehydrogenation rate until a certain H2/alkane ratio, after which the rate decreases monotonically.

本研究考察了在Mg(Ga)(Al)O混合氧化物上支持的Pt催化剂对乙烷和丙烷的脱氢作用。催化剂的性能高度依赖于支持物中的Ga含量，对于乙烷和丙烷脱氢，在Ga/Pt比率为1.45.4时观察到峰值活性。选择性随Ga/Pt比率的增加而单调增加，达到近100%的比率约为5.4。向反应物中添加氢气可以提高脱氢速率，特别是由于氢原子协助脱氢烷基物种形成的脱氢作用，这些物种是在解离吸附反应物烷烃后形成的。与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢产生的焦炭较少，并且没有发现焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间的直接相关性。对于丙烷脱氢，失活程度低于乙烷，但沉积的焦炭量更高。在丙烷脱氢中观察到更高的失活是由于丙烷衍生的Pt覆盖层中焦炭前体的覆盖率更高。由于沉积的碳量超过暴露的Pt，可以得出结论，大部分焦炭位于支持物上而不是位于Pt颗粒上。将氢气引入反应物中可以提高脱氢速率，直到某个H2/烷烃比值，之后该速率呈单调下降趋势。
