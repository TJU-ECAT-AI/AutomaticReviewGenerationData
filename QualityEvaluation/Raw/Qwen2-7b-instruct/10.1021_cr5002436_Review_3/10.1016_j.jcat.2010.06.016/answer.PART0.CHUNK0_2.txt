[1] "The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support was investigated."
[2] "Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4."
[3] "The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation."
[4] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane."
[6] "The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane."
[7] "The amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."
[8] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."

1. The research explored the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation. Research in this field has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the role of various factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at a Ga/Pt ratio of 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of the Ga/Pt ratio, reaching nearly 100% at a ratio of 5.4.

3. The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in an increase in the dehydrogenation rate, attributed to hydrogen-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane.

4. The presence of gallium (Ga) in the support suppressed coke formation. 

5. Less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation. There was no correlation between coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

6. The higher level of deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane is attributed to a higher coverage of platinum (Pt) by coke precursors derived from propane rather than ethane.

7. The amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, suggesting that most of the coke resides on the support rather than on the Pt particles.

8. The amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, confirming that most of the coke resides on the support, with only a small amount residing on the Pt particles.

1. 自1980年代以来，研究探索了以二氧化钒为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品在烷烃脱氢反应中的应用。这一领域的研究重点在于理解载体类型、支撑表面面积以及金属负载等因素对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的影响。

2. 对于乙烷和丙烷脱氢，活性的峰值发生在Ga/Pt比为1.45.4时，选择性是Ga/Pt比的单调函数，在比值为5.4时接近100%。

3. 添加氢气到反应流中导致活性增加，这归因于氢原子辅助下的烷基物种脱氢，该物种是烷烃吸附过程中的产物。

4. 支撑材料中的镓（Ga）的存在抑制了焦炭的形成。

5. 烷烃脱氢过程中，丙烷产生的焦炭量少于乙烷。焦炭形成与催化剂失活之间没有相关性。

6. 由于丙烷产生的焦炭覆盖铂（Pt）颗粒的程度高于乙烷，因此在丙烷脱氢过程中观察到更高的失活水平。

7. 产生的焦炭量大于暴露的Pt量，表明大部分焦炭存在于支撑材料上，而只有少量存在于Pt颗粒上。

8. 产生的焦炭量大于暴露的Pt量，证实大部分焦炭存在于支撑材料上，仅有一小部分位于Pt颗粒上。
