Catalyst performance of novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation Georges Siddiqi, Pingping Sun, Vladimir Galvita, Alexis T. Bell * Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1462, USA a r t i c l e i n f a r t i c l e i n f a b s t r a c t Article history: Received 8 May 2010 Revised 28 June 2010 Accepted 29 June 2010 Available online 10 August 2010 Keywords: Ethane Propane Alkane dehydrogenation Pt Hydrotalcite a b s t r a c t The dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using a Pt catalyst supported on a novel Mg(Ga)(Al)O mixed oxide support was investigated. Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support,a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4. The addition of hydrogen to the feed resulted in a peak in activity with respect to H2/alkane. The increase in dehydrogenation rate with H2 addition is attributed to H-atom-assisted dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of the reactant alkane. Beyond the peak in activity with H2 addition, a further increase in H2 feed concentration contribute to alkene hydrogenation, thereby reducing the net rate of dehydroge- nation. Hydrogen addition to the feed, however, had relatively little effect on alkene selectivity, which remained near 100%. The presence of Ga also suppressed coke formation. Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Thus, the extent of deactivation was lower for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, whereas the amount of coke deposited was higher in the former case.
Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles.
The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane. 

The deactivation of the catalysts was calculated by comparing the percentage change in alkene concentration at the outlet between 1 and 120 min time on stream: Dalkene alkene1 min alkene120 min=alkene1 min 100%

The ratio of hydrogen to ethane partial pressure in the feed was varied from 0 to 2.5, while maintaining the total flow constant by appropriate addition of He. Experiments conducted with the empty reactor showed that the conversion of ethane and propane was less than 0.05% at 893 K.

The selectivity to ethene was determined from Eq. (1) and the selectivity to propene was determined from Eq. (2):
SC2H4 % C2H4=C2H4 0:5CH4 100%
1
SC3H6 % C3H6=C3H6 2=3C2H4 1=3CH4
2=3C2H6 100%

The activity, selectivity, deactivation, and carbon formation after 2 h TOS is presented in Table 1 for Pt, PtSn, and PtGa supported on Mg(Al)O) and for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O. For ethane dehydroge- nation, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, PtSn/Mg(Al)O, and PtGa/Mg(Al)O display comparable activity, selectivity, and deactivation; however, the deposition of coke is 50% less than that observed for the other three catalysts.

The effects of time on stream on the activity and selectivity of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Al)O for propane dehydrogenation are presented in Fig. 6. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O exhibit an initial propene activ- ity that is about 2.5 higher than that of Pt/Mg(Al)O. However, after 2 h TOS, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O loses 30% of its initial activity and Pt/ Mg(Al)O looses 40% of its original activity, a significantly higher extent of deactivation than was observed during ethane dehydro- genation.

The effects of reductionreactionoxidation cycles on catalyst activity during ethane and propane dehydrogenation.
For ethane dehydrogenation, there is a slight increase in activity compared to the first cycle after the second, but a decrease in activ- ity in the following third cycle. The loss in activity between the first and third cycles at 120 min TOS is 2.1%.

The observation of a maximum in catalyst activity with increas- ing Ga/Pt ratio very likely reflects the influence of a monotonic de- crease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused by the presence of Ga atoms at the catalyst surface.

The higher level of deactivation seen during propane versus ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to a higher coverage of Pt by coke precursors derived from propane than ethane.

The effects of H2/C3H8 ratio on the rate of propene formation and the propene selectivity. The addition of H2 to the feed causes the rate of propene formation to increase up to a H2/C3H8 ratio of 1.25. Unlike the case of ethene dehydrogenation, the product concentration of propene does not approach that predicted for equilibrium conversion of the feed. The H2/C3H8 ratio has a somewhat larger effect on the selectivity to propene than on the selectivity to ethene pro- duced by ethane dehydrogenation.

For ethane dehydrogenation, there is a slight increase in activity compared to the first cycle after the second, but a decrease in activ- ity in the following third cycle. The loss in activity between the first and third cycles at 120 min TOS is 2.1%. For propane dehydrogena- tion, the trend changes to a constant decrease in activity with re- peated cycles, the loss in activity between the first and third cycles after 120 min TOS amounting to 14.8%.

The loss in activity for ethane dehydrogenation after 2 h on stream was minimal (3%) in the case of Pt, PtSn, and PtGa supported on Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Ga)(A- l)O but much more significant in the case of propane dehydrogena- tion (2545%).

The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation be- tween loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation.

The loss in activity due to sintering of the metal particles is likely minimal.

The amount of CO chemisorbed before and after alkane dehydro- genation for 2 h was measured for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O (Ga/Pt = 5.4) in an attempt to determine the loss in active sites. The data in Table 2 show after ethane 44% sites capable of CO chemisorption are lost after ethane dehydrogenation, but 98% of such sites are lost after propane dehydrogenation.

We hypothesize that coke not only alters the number of sites for CO adsorption, but also decreases the heat of CO adsorption. Consistent with the latter idea, CO adsorption experiments on Pt(1 1 1), (5 5 7) and (13, 1, 1) surfaces before and after hydrocar- bon reaction have shown that there is a decrease in the CO desorption temperature after hydrocarbon reaction, indicating that the deposited carbonaceous species weaken the binding of CO.

1. 活化催化剂的性能计算通过比较在第一分钟和第120分钟后流出物中烯烃浓度的变化百分比来完成：Dalkene = alkene1 min - alkene120 min/alkene1 min × 100%。

2. 将氢气与乙烷的分压比例从0变化到2.5，同时通过适当添加He保持总流量恒定。在空反应器实验中显示，在893 K时，乙烷和丙烷的转化率小于0.05%。

3. 乙烷的选择性用方程（1）确定，丙烯的选择性用方程（2）确定：
SC2H4 % = C2H4/C2H4 × 0.5CH4 × 100%
1
SC3H6 % = C3H6/C3H6 × 2/3C2H4 × 1/3CH4
2=3C2H6 × 100%

4. 对于丙烷脱氢，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在2小时内的时间流下活性损失了30%，而Pt/Mg(Al)O催化剂则损失了40%，这比乙烷脱氢的活性损失要高得多。

5. 添加氢气到进料中导致丙烯形成速率增加到H2/C3H8比例为1.25。与乙烷脱氢的情况不同，产物的丙烯浓度并没有接近预测的均衡转换量。H2/C3H8的比例对丙烯选择性的影响比对由乙烷脱氢产生的乙烯选择性的影响更大。

6. 金属颗粒熔化引起的活性损失很可能很小。

7. 在尝试确定活性丧失后烷烃脱氢的活性之前，测量了Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O（Ga/Pt = 5.4）催化剂上在2小时内烷烃脱氢前后的CO吸附量。数据显示，在乙烷脱氢后，44%的能够进行CO吸附的表面点丢失了，但在丙烷脱氢后，这种表面点的98%都丢失了。
