The promotion of water in the activation of hydrocarbons catalyzed by binuclear gallium sites in ZSM-5 zeolite is due to the formation of reactive partially hydrolyzed gallium species. The catalytic cycle for mononuclear gallium sites starts with the desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. However, the high energy barrier for hydrogen recombination, at 305 kJ/mol, is due to the low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. The quantum-chemical cluster calculations demonstrate that the cluster with 14 atoms is large enough to encompass all crucial interactions between the cationic species and the zeolite framework, enabling the activation of small molecules such as H2 and H2O. The binuclear gallium species exhibit higher activity compared to single-site Ga+ species, which is consistent with the lower energy required for hydrogen recombination. The dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer occurs through initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

水在由双核镓位点催化并在ZSM-5沸石中激活的烃类中的促进作用，是由于形成活性部分水解的镓物种。单核镓位点的催化循环从[HGa3+(H)(OH)]+的H2脱附开始，形成GaO+离子。然而，氢重组的能量壁垒高达305 kJ/mol，这是由于与氧原子相连的氢原子的极低酸性所致。量子化学簇计算表明，包含14个原子的簇足够大，可以涵盖所有关键的物种与沸石框架之间的相互作用，并能激活诸如H2和H2O这样的小分子。二核镓物种的活性高于单一镓+物种，这与氢重组所需的较低能量一致。烷烃在Ga2O2二聚体上的脱氢通过由Ga3+和额外框架上的氧原子形成的Lewis酸对的异裂开始，随后是烯烃脱附和氢重组。
