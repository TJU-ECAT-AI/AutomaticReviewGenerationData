Water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5 relates to transformation of single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core.

Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity.

Addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates.

The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species.

Since hydrogen-atom recombination at the hydroxylated structuresII and IV is required to initiate alkane dehydrogenation, the corresponding energetics were evaluated.

Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1).

In contrast, the effect on H2O desorption is much smaller.

The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group.

Hydrogen evolution is observed around 600K over Ga+/ZSM-5 in an atmosphere of 0.3vol% H2O in He.

Four Oatoms are detected at a distance of 1.84Å.

A GaGa coordination is identified at an interatomic distance of 2.98Å with a coordination number close to one.

A GaAl backscatterer at a distance of 2.72Å with a coordination number of 1.1 is included.

While EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data, the computations have been carried out for one specific ring structure.

Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate.

Water promotes hydrocarbon activation catalyzed by binuclear gallium sites in ZSM-5. The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly improves propane dehydrogenation over gallium/zsm-5 catalysts. This improvement is attributed to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. Quantum-chemical computations suggest that hydrogen recombination, essential for initiating the catalytic cycle, is more favorable over binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium 3+ complexes compared to mononuclear gallium oxide + ions. The presence of water leads to the formation of reactive partially hydrolyzed gallium species. This results in a higher activity of gallium species containing a gallium 2 oxide 2 core structure, which facilitates hydrogen desorption and enhances the catalytic efficiency. The main product of the reaction is propylene, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation as water content rises. The enhanced activity of gallium clusters containing a gallium 2 oxide 2 core is consistent with lower energy for hydrogen recombination.

水促进了ZSM-5中二核氧桥接镓站点催化下的烃类活化。向烃类进料中添加蒸汽显著提高了在镓/zsm-5催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢反应效率。这种改进归因于反应中间体羟基化态浓度的增加。量子化学计算表明，启动催化循环所需的氢再组合比二核氧桥接的镓3+复合物更容易发生，与单核镓氧化物+离子相比。水的存在导致形成活性部分水解的镓物种。这导致了包含镓2氧化物2核心结构的镓物种活动性增强，从而促进氢再组合并提高催化效率。主要产物是丙烯，随着水含量的增加，轻微增加了甲烷和乙烯的生成。镓簇中包含镓2氧化物2核心结构的增强活性符合氢再组合能较低这一事实。

Water significantly enhances the dehydrogenation of propane over gallium zeolite catalysts, leading to an increase in the concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. Quantum chemical computations show that hydrogen recombination is more favorable in binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium complexes compared to mononuclear gallium oxide ions. Studies have elucidated the mechanism of alkane activation by single gallium Lewis acid sites. The introduction of water to the reaction mixture substantially boosts the activity of the catalyst, as it facilitates the formation of reactive gallium species. This enhancement is attributed to the ability of water to promote the transformation of single gallium ions to binuclear gallium complexes. Hydrogen evolution is observed at temperatures around 600K. Although EXAFS analysis offers averaged structural information, the computational models focus on a specific ring structure within the zeolite. It is crucial to continuously add water to sustain a high concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates for optimal catalytic performance.

水显著提高了在沸石催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的活性，导致反应中间体羟基化物浓度的增加。量子化学计算显示，在氧桥联二核镓复合物中，氢重组比单核镓氧化物离子更有利于催化循环的启动。研究揭示了单核镓Lewis酸位点激活烷烃的机制。将水添加到反应物中能大幅提高催化剂活性，因为它促进了镓物种的反应性形成。这种增强归因于水促进单核镓离子转化为二核氧桥联镓复合物的能力。观察到氢在约600K的温度下释放。虽然X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析提供平均结构信息，但计算模型集中在沸石中的特定环结构上。为了达到最佳催化性能，需要持续添加水以维持高浓度的羟基化反应中间体。

Water is added to the feed to strongly increase the activity of propane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5. The main product remains propylene, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation due to protolytic cracking of propane. The formation of methane and ethylene indicates some regeneration of Brnsted acid protons, which are formed upon hydrolysis of gallium species. The presence of ethylene over methane is attributed to additional proton-catalyzed oligomerization/cracking reactions of propylene. The carbon selectivity to dehydrogenated products remains over 85%. The activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is evident from the increased amount of hydrogen formed. No carbon oxides were detected in the reactor effluent. The activity decrease at higher steam partial pressures is likely due to more complete hydrolysis of the active intrazeolitic Ga sites.

The promotion of water in the activation of hydrocarbons catalyzed by binuclear gallium sites in ZSM-5 zeolite is due to the formation of reactive partially hydrolyzed gallium species. The catalytic cycle for mononuclear gallium sites starts with the desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. However, the high energy barrier for hydrogen recombination, at 305 kJ/mol, is due to the low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. The quantum-chemical cluster calculations demonstrate that the cluster with 14 atoms is large enough to encompass all crucial interactions between the cationic species and the zeolite framework, enabling the activation of small molecules such as H2 and H2O. The binuclear gallium species exhibit higher activity compared to single-site Ga+ species, which is consistent with the lower energy required for hydrogen recombination. The dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer occurs through initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

水在由双核镓位点催化并在ZSM-5沸石中激活的烃类中的促进作用，是由于形成活性部分水解的镓物种。单核镓位点的催化循环从[HGa3+(H)(OH)]+的H2脱附开始，形成GaO+离子。然而，氢重组的能量壁垒高达305 kJ/mol，这是由于与氧原子相连的氢原子的极低酸性所致。量子化学簇计算表明，包含14个原子的簇足够大，可以涵盖所有关键的物种与沸石框架之间的相互作用，并能激活诸如H2和H2O这样的小分子。二核镓物种的活性高于单一镓+物种，这与氢重组所需的较低能量一致。烷烃在Ga2O2二聚体上的脱氢通过由Ga3+和额外框架上的氧原子形成的Lewis酸对的异裂开始，随后是烯烃脱附和氢重组。
