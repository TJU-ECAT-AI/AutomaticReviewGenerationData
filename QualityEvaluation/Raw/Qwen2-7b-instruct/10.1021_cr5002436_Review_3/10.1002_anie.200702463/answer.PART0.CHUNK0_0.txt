Water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5 relates to transformation of single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core.

Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity.

Addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates.

The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species.

Since hydrogen-atom recombination at the hydroxylated structuresII and IV is required to initiate alkane dehydrogenation, the corresponding energetics were evaluated.

Coordination of the hydroxyl group of the [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion to the neighboring gallium cation results in a significant decrease of the reaction energy for H2 recombination (147kJmol1) compared to that from the isolated [Ga(H)(OH)]+ ion (242kJmol1).

In contrast, the effect on H2O desorption is much smaller.

The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group.

Hydrogen evolution is observed around 600K over Ga+/ZSM-5 in an atmosphere of 0.3vol% H2O in He.

Four Oatoms are detected at a distance of 1.84Å.

A GaGa coordination is identified at an interatomic distance of 2.98Å with a coordination number close to one.

A GaAl backscatterer at a distance of 2.72Å with a coordination number of 1.1 is included.

While EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data, the computations have been carried out for one specific ring structure.

Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate.
