Water is added to the feed to strongly increase the activity of propane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5. The main product remains propylene, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation due to protolytic cracking of propane. The formation of methane and ethylene indicates some regeneration of Brnsted acid protons, which are formed upon hydrolysis of gallium species. The presence of ethylene over methane is attributed to additional proton-catalyzed oligomerization/cracking reactions of propylene. The carbon selectivity to dehydrogenated products remains over 85%. The activity of Ga/ZSM-5 compared to HZSM-5 is evident from the increased amount of hydrogen formed. No carbon oxides were detected in the reactor effluent. The activity decrease at higher steam partial pressures is likely due to more complete hydrolysis of the active intrazeolitic Ga sites.

The promotion of propane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 by adding water to the feed is due to the formation of reactive partially hydrolyzed gallium species. This leads to an increase in activity and the formation of propylene as the main product, along with slight increases in methane and ethylene. The regeneration of Brnsted acid protons, formed upon hydrolysis of gallium species, is responsible for the additional cracking reactions leading to ethylene formation over methane. The carbon selectivity to dehydrogenated products remains high above 85%, and no carbon oxides are detected in the reactor effluent. The activity decrease at higher steam pressures is attributed to the more complete hydrolysis of the active gallium sites within the zeolite.

向原料中添加水促进了Ga/ZSM-5对丙烷的转化，这归因于形成活性部分水解镓物种。这导致了活性的增加和丙烯作为主要产物的形成，同时伴有少量甲烷和乙烯的生成。Brnsted酸性质子的再生，这些质子是通过镓物种的水解形成的，负责额外的裂解反应导致乙烯的形成超过甲烷。碳选择性到脱氢产物保持在85%以上，没有检测到碳氧化物在反应器流出物中。在较高蒸汽压力下活动下降的原因是活性镓位点在沸石内的更完全水解。
