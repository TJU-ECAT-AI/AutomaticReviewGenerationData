Water promotes hydrocarbon activation catalyzed by binuclear gallium sites in ZSM-5. The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly improves propane dehydrogenation over gallium/zsm-5 catalysts. This improvement is attributed to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. Quantum-chemical computations suggest that hydrogen recombination, essential for initiating the catalytic cycle, is more favorable over binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium 3+ complexes compared to mononuclear gallium oxide + ions. The presence of water leads to the formation of reactive partially hydrolyzed gallium species. This results in a higher activity of gallium species containing a gallium 2 oxide 2 core structure, which facilitates hydrogen desorption and enhances the catalytic efficiency. The main product of the reaction is propylene, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation as water content rises. The enhanced activity of gallium clusters containing a gallium 2 oxide 2 core is consistent with lower energy for hydrogen recombination.

水促进了ZSM-5中二核氧桥接镓站点催化下的烃类活化。向烃类进料中添加蒸汽显著提高了在镓/zsm-5催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢反应效率。这种改进归因于反应中间体羟基化态浓度的增加。量子化学计算表明，启动催化循环所需的氢再组合比二核氧桥接的镓3+复合物更容易发生，与单核镓氧化物+离子相比。水的存在导致形成活性部分水解的镓物种。这导致了包含镓2氧化物2核心结构的镓物种活动性增强，从而促进氢再组合并提高催化效率。主要产物是丙烯，随着水含量的增加，轻微增加了甲烷和乙烯的生成。镓簇中包含镓2氧化物2核心结构的增强活性符合氢再组合能较低这一事实。
