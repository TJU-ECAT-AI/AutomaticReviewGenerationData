Water significantly enhances the dehydrogenation of propane over gallium zeolite catalysts, leading to an increase in the concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. Quantum chemical computations show that hydrogen recombination is more favorable in binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium complexes compared to mononuclear gallium oxide ions. Studies have elucidated the mechanism of alkane activation by single gallium Lewis acid sites. The introduction of water to the reaction mixture substantially boosts the activity of the catalyst, as it facilitates the formation of reactive gallium species. This enhancement is attributed to the ability of water to promote the transformation of single gallium ions to binuclear gallium complexes. Hydrogen evolution is observed at temperatures around 600K. Although EXAFS analysis offers averaged structural information, the computational models focus on a specific ring structure within the zeolite. It is crucial to continuously add water to sustain a high concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates for optimal catalytic performance.

水显著提高了在沸石催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的活性，导致反应中间体羟基化物浓度的增加。量子化学计算显示，在氧桥联二核镓复合物中，氢重组比单核镓氧化物离子更有利于催化循环的启动。研究揭示了单核镓Lewis酸位点激活烷烃的机制。将水添加到反应物中能大幅提高催化剂活性，因为它促进了镓物种的反应性形成。这种增强归因于水促进单核镓离子转化为二核氧桥联镓复合物的能力。观察到氢在约600K的温度下释放。虽然X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析提供平均结构信息，但计算模型集中在沸石中的特定环结构上。为了达到最佳催化性能，需要持续添加水以维持高浓度的羟基化反应中间体。
