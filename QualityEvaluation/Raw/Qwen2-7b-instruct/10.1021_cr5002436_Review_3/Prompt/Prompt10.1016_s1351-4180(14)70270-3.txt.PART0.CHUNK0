MARKETS AND
BUSINESS
Market value of catalysts to rise to more than $22 bn by 2021, predicts Ceresana The latest study published by the market research institute Ceresana projects that the total market value of catalysts will increase to more than $22 bn by 2021. North America accounts for a world market share of 42%. The US, which processes a particularly large amount of crude oil,is the largest consumer of catalysts.
The Asia Pacific region is a fast growing market with China exhibiting the highest growth rate of the 20 countries analyzed by Ceresana.
Chinese demand will increase by
4.5%/y. Demand in Western Europe is
falling, with the southern EU countries affected by the financial crisis. About 80% of all the catalysts consumed are utilized in the refining of crude oil, for example in processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, or reforming. For polymerization, Ceresana forecasts the most dynamic development at an AAGR of 3.1%/y until 2021, with the synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene accounting for the major share. The global market for bioplastics like polypropylene and polyethylene is expected to grow at an AAGR of almost 20%/y in the next eight years.
Ceresana forecasts revenues generated with catalysts for chemical synthesis to increase to approximately $8.7 bn during the next eight years due to the upturn of global economic development.

TechNavios analysts forecast the global zeolite market to grow at a CAGR of 7.33% over the period 2013-2018. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased use of zeolites in catalysis and petroleum refining.
The global zeolite market has also been witnessing the trend of increase in production capacities. However, the intense competition leading to price wars could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.

Total annual production of biobased chemicals stood at around 113 M tonnes in 2013, with ethanol capacity reaching about 89 M tonnes. Propylene and pygas co-products are now being overshadowed by plant-derived products (eg sugars and glycerol) in the production of commodity chemicals like butanediol, isoprene,paraxylene, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid and isosorbide. With lower overall greenhouse gas emissions, bio-based chemicals are now taking over due to consumer demand and corporate sustainability initiatives. Propylene glycol is now being produced by Archer Daniels Midland from biodiesel co-product glycerol, while bio-based 1,4-butanediol is now being supplied by BASF using Genomaticas technology. Sorbitol and lactic acid production from bio-based acrylic acid is now being developed by Cargill Inc,in collaboration with BASF and Novozymes. Bio-based 1,3- propanediol is now being produced by DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Products, a DuPont-Tate & Lyle jv, as raw material for engineering plastics, fibres and personal care products. Bio-based epichlorohydrin is now being produced from glycerol by Jiangsu Yangnong Chemical, Solvay, and Vinythai Public Co Ltd. Bio-based isobutanol and paraxylene are now being produced by Gevo Inc on commercial and pilot scales,respectively. Bio-based butanol and acetone are now being derived from agricultural wastes (eg corn stover and cobs) by Laihe Rockley Biochemicals.

Bunge (an agribusiness company) and Solazyme (a company producing algal oils) have formed a jv that will produce renewable oils from its facility in Moema, Brazil. The facility has a capacity of 100,000 tonne/y. The oils will be sold to consumers in the chemicals, fuels, nutrition, and personal care products industry. Gevo (a biobased chemicals firm) has started shipping renewable p-xylene produced from sugar-based isobutyl alcohol to Toray Industries of Japan.Meanwhile, Enerkem (a firm converting municipal waste to fuels) has started its first full-scale facility in Edmonton, AB, Canada. The plant will produce methanol and ethanol from waste amounting to 10 M gal/y.

licensing processes for the on- purpose production of linear butenes and butadiene. BASF has developed process technology and catalysts as well as the extraction technologies,while Linde is providing its expertise for the integration, optimization, and commercialization of the process. The new process will deliver an on- purpose route from butane to butadiene via butenes. Currently, the industry relies mainly on butadiene as a co-product from naphtha-cracking to ethylene. The shift to lighter cracker feedstock results in reduced volumes of co-products. Therefore the on- purpose production of higher olefins is gaining more and more importance.

Lactic acid is the building block for NatureWorks Ingeo lactide intermediates and polymers used in consumer and industrial products worldwide. The joint development programme, which started in Jun 2013 between Calysta and NatureWorks, is focused on creation of a commercially viable methane-to- lactic-acid process. The key aims are providing a structurally simplified,lower cost Ingeo production platform and diversifying NatureWorks feedstock portfolio. If successful, the technology could directly access carbon from methane produced from societys organic wastes in wastewater treatment, landfill decomposition, and anaerobic digestion. While the critical lab scale first stage of the project has confirmed methane conversion to lactic acid,much additional development work remains. A full demonstration of commercial feasibility may require up to five years of development effort.
The companies will share commer- cialization rights for select products developed under the agreement.
