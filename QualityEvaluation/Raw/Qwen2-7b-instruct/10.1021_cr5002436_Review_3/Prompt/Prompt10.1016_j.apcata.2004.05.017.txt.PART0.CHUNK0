Experiments are developed at 520 C in a fixed bed microreactor. Catalyst characterization via TPR demonstrates the presence of different VOx species with the nature of these species being a function of the catalyst support. The acidic properties of the prepared catalysts are also evaluated using NH3 TPD with the following order of acidity being observed: VOX/-Al2O3 > VOxM/-Al2O3 > VOx/USY. Reactivity experiments show that the VOx/USY provides both the highest catalytic activity and butane selectivity, with the VOx/-Al2O3 displaying a lower activity and butane selectivity and the other tested catalyst samples being essentially inactive. The superior performance of the VOx/USY catalyst is assigned to its mild acidity. 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in oxygen free atmo- spheres is a valuable approach to produce alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. While sup- ported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial pro- cesses [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36].
Important drawbacks still exist with the implementation of this catalytic reaction. First, alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and it requires relatively high tem- peratures and low pressures to yields significant fractions of alkenes. Under these conditions, thermal cracking to lighter alkanes and coke formation are also promoted with the alkane transformation being quite unselective given all CH and CC bonds display close reactivity. As a reference, an industrial based Pt catalyst 0.1PtZn silicate/Al2O3 (Philips Corresponding author. Tel.: +54-291-4861700;fax: +54-291-4861600.E-mail address: mvolpe@plapiqui.edu.ar (M. Volpe).
STAR) at a 538 C displays a conversion of 29.8% and a selectivity to olefins of 76.4%.
Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier. In this con- text, the purpose of this work is to determine the activity and selectivity of supported vanadium on four different materi- als: -Al2O3 and -Al2O3, USY (ultrastable HY) and NaY zeolite.
Both, -alumina and USY zeolite are solid acids. It is thus expected that alkane dehydrogenation using these sup- ports will be accompanied with undesired cracking and cok- ing leading to significant catalyst deactivation. In contrast,the use of non-acidic -alumina and NaY zeolite may be valuable given the potential minimization of unwanted sec- ondary reactions.
Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acidbase properties are studied here. Characterization of these cata- lysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). 0926-860X/$  see front matter  2004 Elsevier B.V.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A number of VOx catalysts were considered in the present study as follows: -Al2O3 (Rh one Poulenc, 120 m2/g),-Al2O3 (Rh one Poulenc,13 m2/g),
USY
(TOSOH
320HOA, ultra stable Y zeolite, 3.5% Na and 626 m2/g) and NaY (Strem Chemicals PRODUCT #: 14-8960, 731 m2/g).
Before preparing the supported vanadium catalysts, the particles of support were calcined at 500 C for 4 h under a GC quality air flow. Following this, approximately 2 g of support were contacted with V(AcAc)3 (vanadium III acety- lacetonate) solutions (Aldrich, 99.998% pure) in toluene.
The support impregnation was performed at room tem- perature for a 24 h period. The impregnated particles were filtered and separated from the supernatant liquid and the re- sulting cake was washed three times with fresh solvent. The resulting cake was dried first at 150 C and following this,the impregnated particles (catalyst precursor) were calcined under a GC quality air stream at 600 C for a 6 h period.
The same preparation methodology was consistently adopted while impregnating the various supports and this led to VOx supported on USY, NaY, -Al2O3 and -Al2O3.
For the purpose of identifying the several VOx supported catalysts the following codes are adopted in the upcoming sections: VOx/USY (VOx supported on USY), VOx/NaY (VOx supported on NaY), VOx/-Al2O3 (VOx supported on -Al2O3) and VOx/-Al2O3(VOx supported on -Al2O3).
In addition to preparing an additional sample of VOx sup- ported on -Al2O3, a slightly different method was adopted.
The alumina support was contacted with a pH 4 NH4VO3 (ammonium metavanadate) aqueous solution at room tem- perature for 24 h. Samples were subsequently filtered and calcined under air flow at 500 C for 4 h. This sample is re- ferred, in the present study as VOxM/-Al2O3.
Once the various catalyst samples prepared, the bulk amount of vanadium in each one of the catalysts was deter- mined using atomic absorption spectroscopy.
2.2. Samples characterization
2.2.1. N2 and Ar Isotherms
Nitrogen and argon adsorption were carried out at 77 K on an ASAP 2010 automatic adsorption analyzer equipped with micropore option (from 7Micromeritics). Before the measurements, samples weighing from 0.1 to 0.3 g were degassed at 100 C for 1 h and at 300 C for 10 h. Adsorption isotherms were measured in the 106 to 1, relative pressure range.
2.2.2. Temperature programmed reduction and oxidation
Both TPO and TPR experiments over fresh samples were conducted using an AutoChem II instrument.
A reducing gas mixture (10.2% H289.8% Ar) was al- lowed to contact the catalyst sample at a 50 ml STP/min.
Temperature was increased at 10 C/min up to a maximum of 900 C. Hydrogen concentration changes were determined in the outlet gas stream via a TCD detector. The area of the resulting peaks was integrated numerically, yielding the to- tal hydrogen uptake volume.
TPO experiments were subsequently carried out employ- ing the same method as for TPR analysis with samples be- ing pretreated at 500 C for 1 h under a 50 ml STP/min in- ert gas flow. Following this, samples were contacted with 5% O295% He gas mixture. TPOs were effected for both VOx/USY and VOx/-Al2O3 after 40 or 80 min of having the catalyst sample under reducing conditions. TPO experiments also allowed estimating the coke deposited on aged catalysts.
In these cases a 100 mg catalyst sample was employed.
2.2.3. Temperature programmed desorption
An AutoChem II analyzer from Micromeritics was used for TPD analysis. The catalyst sample (ranging 0.10.3 g),set in a quartz container, was degassed for 2 h at 500 C. The sample was brought to saturation level using an NH3/He gas mixture (4.55% ammonia, 95.55% helium). The adsorption of ammonia was carried out for 1 h at 140 C. The ammonia flow was then switched off, and replaced by an inert purge gas (He) at a 50 ml STP/min rate for 1 h at the same tem- perature of ammonia adsorption. Then, the temperature was raised using a 15 C/min ramp. As the temperature increased,desorption took place with the TCD signal being recorded.
2.3. Activity measurements
Catalytic activity tests were performed in a fixed bed micro-reactor with a mass of catalyst in the 0.070.25 g range. The weight of the catalyst sample was selected to keep in all cases a close to constant amount of vanadium,set at 4 mg.
The catalytic test was initiated with the catalyst sample being preheated using a 5 C/min ramp under airflow until the 520 C reaction temperature was reached. This precon- ditioning of the catalysts secured that the supported VOx was under the fully oxidized state.
Following this, the true catalytic test was initiated feed- ing to the microreactor a 30 ml STP/min 10% of n-butane in nitrogen mixture. The outlet reactor products were GC an- alyzed periodically (every 4 min for a 1 h period), using a TCD detector and a Chromwas packed column.
On the basis of the data obtained the overall n-butane conversion and selectivity towards butenes formation were calculated.

3.1. Catalysts bulk composition
Vanadium content for the various prepared catalysts is re- ported in Table 1. It can be observed that for both the NaY and -Al2O3 supports, a small amount of vanadium was in-

It was also noticed that the amount of supported V on -Al2O3 in- creased for the sample prepared via the NH4VO3 precursor.
3.2. Catalysts characterization
3.2.1. BET area measurements
BET areas of the bare supports and those of the corre- sponding VOx/support samples are reported in Table 1. It was noticed that the specific surface area of the support was unaffected upon the introduction of VOx for both  and alumina. In contrast with this, a strong decrease of the specific surface area was observed for the USY supported catalyst, with the BET area being reduced by nearly 50% after vanadium impregnation. Considering the large size of the V(AcAc)3 molecule, in the 50 Ã range, it can be spec- ulated that the VOx/USY impregnation via the acetylaceto- nate molecule incorporation into the zeolite cage is largely unsuccessful with the VOx species precursor essentially dis- persed on the zeolite extra framework surface.
In this respect, it is important to mention that, vanadium oxides are known fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts poisons, with vanadium oxide species destroying the Brn- sted acid sites and the structure of the ultrastable zeolite USY [7]. While, in the case of the catalysts of the present study, VOx species are not exposed to steam, an important require- ment for preventing the zeolite collapse. Although H2O was formed during the initial calcination via combustion of the acetyl acetone, water was formed in minute amounts. On this basis it can be stated, that the prepared catalysts were in an essentially free of steam/water atmosphere during the preparation or pretreatment process. Thus there was no opportunity for the zeolite destruction to take place.
The theoretical coverage of the catalyst, Î¸, is calculated assuming a V2O5 unit cell area of 0.165 nm2 in the (1 0 0) plane of vanadium pentoxide [8] and also considering the initial BET area of the support, as reported in Table 1. It can thus, be appreciated that a VOx theoretical partial cov- erage of the supports is obtained for all the catalysts, except for VOxM/-Al2O3. In the latter case, the amount of VOx exceeds the monolayer capacity of the support and this sug- gests the presence of V2O5 crystallites or a vanadia over layer on this catalyst sample.

3.2.2. Temperature programmed reduction
TPR is widely used to investigate the different types of oxidized species in vanadium oxides catalysts [912].
Fig. 1 reports the TPR profile for VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst showing a main peak at 460 C with a shoulder at 410 C.
This is consistent with the well-known strong affinity be- tween alumina and vanadia [13]. As a result, monomeric or dimeric vanadates are formed at low vanadia load- ings, with more prevalent polyvanadates chains at higher V-concentrations. Even more the higher vanadium concen- trations may yield a supported monolayer [12,13]. Taking this into account, the H2 consumption peak in the b pro- file of Fig. 1, corresponding to VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts, is assigned to VOx chains or bi-dimensional species reduc- tion, while the lower temperature shoulder is postulated as the result of the reduction of mono or divandates species.
In the case of VOxM/-Al2O3 (profile a in Fig. 1) a broad H2 consumption peak between 400 and 600 C is ob- served. Since the V loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of the low surface -Al2O3, it is expected that a V overlayer could grow on this support and that the consumption peak could be assigned to the reduction of those species.
Finally, the TPR profile of VOx/USY (profile c in Fig. 1) displays distinctive trends of those corresponding to VOx supported on  and -alumina. Three peaks were now no- ticed, with maximum temperature peaks placed at 580, 670 and 780 C, respectively, and a shoulder at 460 C. The 460 C shoulder is attributed to the reduction of isolated VOx species, while 580, 670 and 780 C peaks are assigned to a three step crystalline V2O5 reduction [12].
In order to interpret these TPR profiles the following has to be considered: (a) a vanadia monolayer over USY is quite unlikely to be present, given the acid character of the zeolite support, (b) VOV bond formation is not viable and VOx chains or a VOx monolayer are not expected to develop.
Complementary XRD analyses were also effected to con- firm the existence of crystalline V-oxide phases on the USY 72

Unfortunately,the XRD failed to show VOx modifications of the zeolite structure, and this given the vanadia crystallite sizes were below the minimum XRD detection limit. While only a mi- nor decrease of the intensity of XRD peaks was observed,this change could not be positively assigned to a specific modification of the zeolite (extend of dehydration, reduction of zeolite concentration by the addition of vanadia species,slight framework dislocation/destruction).
3.2.3. TPO/TPR cycles
Catalysts undergo under the conditions of free of oxygen atmosphere dehydrogenation of n-butane rapid deactivation due to coke. Thus, it is necessary to restore catalyst activity with frequent catalyst regenerations. In this context, succes- Fig. 3. Successive TPR profiles for VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst.

Fig. 3 reports the TPR profiles for VOx/-Al2O3 cata- lyst with no observable activity change through successive calcinationreduction cycles. These results show, that re- peated calcination does not alter the reducibility of the sup- ported V-species. In agreement with this, minor variations were observed in terms of the observable gas consumption for various TPRs.
On the other hand, the TPRs for the VOx/USY catalyst show (Fig. 4) that this catalyst does undergo transforma- tions through oxidationreduction cycles. Fig. 4 shows that while the first two TPR were close, subsequent treatments display, in the high temperature range, quite different H2 consumption patterns. Thus, it appears that the peaks as-

The number assigned to each one of the TPR profiles refers to the number of calcinationreduction cycles performed over the sample. signed to V2O5 crystallites become less defined, with the three-dimensional oxide species not being able to remain unaffected under regeneration conditions. Regarding hydro- gen consumption patterns, as reported in Fig. 4, it is proven that the total H2 consumption slightly diminishes from the first to the last experiment.
3.2.4. Temperature programmed desorption of NH3
NH3 TPD is frequently used to characterize the strength as well as the acid site amount on a solid surface. Due to its strong acidity and small molecular dimensions (3.70 ÃÃ
3.99 ÃÃ3.11 Ã) [14] ammonia is a suitable probe molecule
for all OH groups on zeolite, even those accessible through pores, channels, or windows 4 Ã. Fig. 5 reports the am- monia TPD for some of the catalysts used in this work. Be- Fig. 5.

3.2.4.1. USY and VOx/USY.
The USY zeolite sample dis- played one single peak at 271 C. This peak was assigned to both Brnsted and Lewis low-strength acid sites. Upon ad- dition of VOx on the USY support, the TPD peak strongly decreases (refer to profiles a and b in Fig. 5). While de- scribing this effect it is important to consider that V loadings in the zeolite are quite low (6.3%). Considering the very large surface available in the USY support only partial sur- face coverage is achieved. Thus, it is possible to argue that the VOx addition reduces the acidity of the zeolite and this is likely to be due to the V2O5 crystallite phase formation,which blocks zeolite windows and supercages and strongly hinders NH3 accessibility. It is perhaps possible that in a situation like the one described, the NH3 only measures the external surface and/or cracks surfaces of the USY.
Another interesting observation relates to the shifting of TPD peak from 271 to 240 C for USY and VOx/USY, re- spectively. It is very likely this shift is the result of the VOx own acidity, with the acidity measured via TPD being the combined contribution of the support and of VOx species.

and VOx/-Al2O3.
Concerning

acidity in -Al2O3, profile c in Fig. 5, a 253 C peak was observed with this peak being assigned to the support acidity. It can be noticed comparing this TPD profile with the one corresponding to VOx/-Al2O3 that the acid site concentration decreases considerably after adding the VOx to the support (refer d profile). This acidity reduction may be attributed to the coverage of the surface of the -alumina with VOx species. However, since the support coverage is partially accomplished (refer to Table 1, last column) a cer- tain number of acid sites remain vacant after VOx addition.
3.2.4.3. Î±-Al2O3 and VOxM/-Al2O3.
A minor desorp- tion peak was observed in the TPD profile of -Al2O3, a non-acid solid. Surprisingly, the acidity increased for the VOxM/-Al2O3. It appears, in this respect, that the sup- ported VOx monolayer also contributes with its own acidity. 74

3.3. Catalytic activity
Catalytic runs were preceded with a number of blank runs. During these blank runs, the support only was loaded in the reactor. No measurable n-butane conversion was ob- served at the catalytic reaction conditions, for both -Al2O3 or -Al2O3. This proves two important facts: (a) the alu- mina support is inert under reaction conditions; (b) there is no contribution of the homogeneous n-butane conversion.
Furthermore blank tests with USY gave low 13% n-butane conversions proving again the lack of contribution of the support as well as the negligible homogenous conversion of n-butane.
Concerning the catalytic activity experiments, n-butane conversions on VOx/USY, VOx/-Al2O3 and VOxM/-Al2O3 catalysts are reported in Fig. 6. Data corresponding to VOx/-Al2O3 and VOx/NaY are not reported in Fig. 6 or reviewed in this section given the negligible catalytic activity observed for these two catalysts.
At
520 C
and with a n-butane/nitrogen feed of
1:9 mol/mol, the allowed thermodynamic n-butane conver-
sion to 1-butene, cis and trans 2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene,is 65%. It should in this respect be noted that the experi- mentally observed n-butane conversion for both VOx/USY and VOx/-Al2O3 was considerably lower than the thermo- dynamic upper conversion limit.
Regarding the reaction experiments, as reported in Fig. 6,one can observe a starting reaction phase where n-butane conversion increases with time-on-stream. This consis- tent result obtained for both VOx/-Al2O3 and VOx/USY yielded, respectively, at 4 min, maxima of 9 and 11% n-butane conversions. Thus, it appears that the n-butane dehydrogenation, under a free of oxygen atmosphere, pro- Fig. 6. n-Butane conversion at 520 C with calcined VOx/support catalysts. References: () VOx/-Al2O3; () VOx/USY; (+) VOxM/-Al2O3. ceeds via an initiation phase with the formation of key intermediate species or active site that plays an important role later in the subsequent reaction steps.
Following this initial phase, with n-butane conversion reaching a maximum level, n-butane conversion starts de- creasing with VOx/-Al2O3 becoming fully inactive and VOx/USY stabilizing in a low activity level at 40 min of time-on-stream.
Harlin et al. [6] measured n-butane conversion at 580 C and WHVS of 5 h1over VOx supported on calcined alumina. These authors also observed a slight increase in conversion from 18 to 23% during the first 5 min of time-on-stream and this was in agreement with the findings of this study showing an initial reaction period of increased catalytic activity.
In Fig. 6 it can also be noticed that the VOx/USY re- mains for all the time-on-stream studied more active than VOx/-Al2O3. Even though cracking reactions, promote coke formation; the VOx/USY catalyst still remains, after 40 min, catalytically active. It thus appears as if the surface in this catalyst is subjected, after a given time-on-stream, to a much slower activity losses, still displaying under these conditions a favorable performance towards the reactions leading to olefin formation.
The VOxM/-Al2O3 displayed however, a very lim- ited n-butane conversion, even though a relatively high concentration of VOx species is present on this catalyst,and its acidity is higher than the acidity of the VOx/USY (refer to Table 2). This behavior can be assigned to the formation of a vanadia overlayer on the -Al2O3 support with the expected result of a low fraction of V-species ex- posed, leading overall to a low concentration of V-active sites.

Finally, if one envision this reactor as a continuous cir- culating fluidized bed reactor the data of this study allows to predict that one should remove the successfully prepared catalyst (e.g. VOx/USY) every 30 min of catalyst residence time and this to achieve a good level of overall activity. Fol- lowing this the catalyst should be fully reoxidized and sent back again for another catalytic dehydrogenation cycle.
Concerning reaction products the following species were consistently observed during the catalytic activity tests: COx,1-butene, 2-trans and 2-cis butene, 1,3-butadiene, and small amounts of methane, propane and i-butane. The formation of coke was also detected in the spent catalysts (refer to Section 4). Given coke amounts were estimated to be, in all cases below 2% coke was not included in selectivity calcu- lations. In addition no oxygenated products were detected thus no oxygenate species were needed to be accounted in the selectivity analysis.
The dependence of alkene selectivity, S%, with cata- lyst time-on-stream is described in Fig. 7 and this for the most active catalysts: VOx/USY and VOx/-Al2O3. Prod- uct distribution is reported in Table 3 for a 4 min catalyst time-on-stream. Reviewing product distribution, it was also Table 3 Distribution of products at 4 min of reaction for the dehydrogenation of n-butane with calcined VOx/USY and VOx/-Al2O3 Catalyst

In addition it was also observed that the selectivity pattern was very specific for each one of the catalysts studied. No selectivity results cor- responding to VOxM/-Al2O3 are reported and this given the uncertainty of defining selectivity at low conversions.
The %S increased consistently (refer to Fig. 7) for both the VOx/USY, from 55 to 75% and for the VOx/-Al2O3,from 45 to 60%. An interesting result was that butenes selec- tivity of the VOx/USY catalyst surpassed in all cases those for VOx/-Al2O3. These differences in the butene selectiv- ity were ascribed to the acidity differences between these two catalysts, a dominant property determining butane de- hydrogenation into butenes.
Another consistent and valuable observation both for VOx/-Al2O3 and for VOx/USY, was given by the fact that COx formation was only noticeably at 4 min with no COx measurements afterwards. This early COx formation can be linked to the reduction of V5+ sites and this happens at the same time-on-stream than the maximum n-butane conver- sion is observed (Fig. 6). Furthermore, this free of COx prod- uct species, for times-on-stream larger than 4 min was very encouraging, given it allows to argue that two of the catalysts developed in this study display a high selective for n-butane conversion, yielding valuable non-COx products only.
Table 3 reports the fractions of other than butenes and COx product species formed via cracking and isomerization reactions (propane, methane, isobutane). Selectivity towards these species is higher for VOx/-Al2O3 than for VOx/USY,during the first 4 min.
3.3.1. Activity of regenerated sample
Due mainly to the coke formation, samples become in- active with time-on-stream. Thus, it is important to estab- 76

In this context, the dehydrogenation reaction was car- ried out over used VOx/-Al2O3 and VOx/USY catalysts.
The aged samples were calcined in situ for 1 h at the reac- tion temperature and subsequently a new catalytic test was carried out. Once again, the activity and selectivity were measured at the same conditions as for fresh samples. The dependence of n-butane conversion with time-on-stream for a regenerated VOx/USY sample is reported in Fig. 8. For the sake of comparison the data corresponding to a fresh VOx/USY sample are also reported. Both catalyst tested, dis- played an activity-selectivity behavior with time-on-stream very close to the one for the fresh catalyst indicating that the catalyst deactivation by coke can be completely reversed and that the nature of VOx species was the same following reaction-regeneration treatments.
3.4. Temperature programmed oxidation
TPO tests were carried out for VOx/-Al2O3 and VOx/USY fresh and spent catalysts only and this to deter- mine the amounts of coke formed during the reaction period (gray lines in Fig. 9). The gray TPO curves show a broad negative peak, assigned to the formation of CO2 resulting from coke oxidation.
In both cases, the coke was calcined at the close temper- atures, suggesting that the nature of coke species was, for both catalysts, similar. Even more given that calcinations were effected under oxygen excess conditions, it was as- sumed that combustion was complete and the TCD signals were directly proportional to the CO2 formed and thus to the coke present on the catalyst surface.
On this basis the COx amount evolved per gram of vana- dium (reported in Table 3) was calculated. It was observed that this amount was much higher (approximately twice) for VOx/-Al2O3 than for VOx/USY. These findings show higher coke levels on the VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst and are in agreement with the catalytic test results, which indicate that cracking reactions and catalyst decay are more dominant over VOx/-Al2O3 than over VOx/USY.
Furthermore, the TPO profiles in the subsequent second oxidation cycle (black lines in Fig. 9) showed a main peak,with these positive peaks representing O2 consumption of an 5% O2/95% He mixture. A maximum peak at 130 C was observed for VOx/-Al2O3. This early peak was assigned 50 150 250 350 450 550 650 Temperature (C) TCD signal (A.U.) (a) (a) (b) (b) Fig. 9. TPO profiles.

77 to the VOx1 species re-oxidation. For the VOx/USY there were however, two extra peaks centered at 190 and 450 C,respectively. The first one was similar to the one observed for vanadium on alumina, while the peak at the higher tem- perature was assigned to the oxidation of partially reduced vanadia crystallites. Thus, TPO profiles were, in this respect well in agreement with TPR curves and pointed towards the presence of V2O5 crystallites on VOx/USY catalysts.
4. Discussion
Based on the reported results, it can be mentioned that the n-butane catalytic dehydrogenation in a free of oxygen atmosphere, both in terms of activity and selectivity is related to the various catalyst surface properties as described via the several characterization tests performed.
In this respect, it was observed that the nature of the sup- port, be this USY or -alumina, leads to different vanadium species, well dispersed mono or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayer or V2O5 crystallites.
The vanadium pentoxide crystallites formed are specific species of the VOx/USY catalyst, and this leads to a num- ber of effects such as blocking of windows and supercages,reduction of specific surface area and TPD acidity modifi- cations. The V2O5 crystallites appear to limit considerably isomerization and cracking reactions favoring coke forma- tion. Besides, well-dispersed VOx species, also present in the VOx/USY catalyst, promote the formation of butenes,turning the VOx/USY in the most active and selective cata- lysts for the n-butane catalytic dehydrogenation.
Concerning the VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst, TPR results show highly dispersed vanadia on the alumina surface, with no evidence of V2O5 crystallites formation.
Furthermore, VOx addition appears to reduce support acidity, as observed via ammonia TPD, yielding as a result slightly acidic catalysts, with this mild acidity being criti- cal to the formation of active sites. Even more, given the relatively high catalytic dehydrogenation activity observed a high concentration of VOx exposed active sites can be hypothesized.
It also appears in the catalytic dehydrogenation of butane there are significant mechanistic changes occurring during the first minutes of catalyst time-on-stream. During this ini- tial phase either the nature or the controlling reaction step changes with VOx forming some COx. Once this initial pe- riod completed no additional formation of COx is noticed with all observed products being hydrocarbon species. Since the n-butane conversion increases during the first few min- utes of reaction, one could envisage that a pre-reduction prior to catalyst exposure to n-butane (a common treatment for both Pt and Cr2O3 supported on alumina catalyst) could as well increase the initial conversion. Supporting this view it can be stated that in separate catalytic runs performed by our group over prereduced VOx/-Al2O3 under H2 flow at 520 C, and this led at 4 min to higher n-butane con- versions than while using calcined catalysts. Furthermore,under those conditions no COx was detected. However, no reproducible data was obtained over prereduced VOx/USY,and the effect of pre-reduction on catalyst performance, is considered to be a substantial issue, left for a forthcoming study.
Finally, regarding to VOxM/-Al2O3 catalyst, the selected catalyst preparation leads to an essentially inactive material.
It is hypothesized, on the basis of TPR data, that there is a vanadium overlayer formed which strongly contribute to the low activity of this catalyst.
Results of the present study also point towards the signif- icance of moderating, as much as possible, the butane and butenes catalytic cracking activity of the prepared catalysts.
Cracking reactions are promoted on the acid sites of the bare support with selectivity towards the desired olefin products being negatively affected. Thus, catalytic cracking activity should be restricted, as much as possible, using weak acidity supports with all this leading to a minimization of undesir- able cracking reactions.
As a result and from the scenario depicted above, it can be suggested that the best butane dehydrogenation catalyst in oxygen free atmosphere should be one designed, as is the case of the VOx/USY, with a highly dispersed reduced VOx phase on a slightly acidic support.
5. Conclusions
The following are the relevant conclusion of the present study: Several VOx catalysts supported on different oxide carri- ers were successfully prepared.
VOx/USY and VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts prepared via im- pregnation with V(AcAc)3 precursors, dried and cal- cined, led to active and selective materials for n-butane dehydrogenation under a free oxygen atmosphere.
The VOx/USY catalysts provided a high 6075% alkene selectivity. This selectivity, was higher than the one for the VOx/-Al2O3, with this selectivity difference being assigned to the mild VOx/USY acidity.
