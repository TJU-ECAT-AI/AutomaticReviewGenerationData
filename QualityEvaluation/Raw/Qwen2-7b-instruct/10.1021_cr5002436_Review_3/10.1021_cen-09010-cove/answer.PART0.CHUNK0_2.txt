[1] "And while petrochemical companies in other regions, notably Europe, are strug gling to turn a profit, North American firms are raking in substantial returns."
[2] "Beyond large projects, nearly every producer of ethylene or derivatives is contemplating expansions to take advantage of low raw material costs."
[3] "This advantage of natural gas liquids over naphtha is enormous. According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liq uids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naph tha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."
[4] "Profit margins for eth ylene on the spot market are now the high est they have been since 1988. Spot prices have been extremely high, even though demand is relatively tepid, he says."
[5] "Of the companies that announced new ethylene crackers over the past year, Chev ron Phillips was the first out of the gate with an announcement last spring. It intends to build a 1.5 million-metric-ton ethylene crack er at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas, and downstream polyethylene plants."

Answer: 
The document highlights that the shale boom has significantly influenced the North American petrochemical industry, leading to substantial returns for firms compared to struggling European companies. This prosperity is attributed to the abundance and low cost of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, which has become the primary feedstock for ethylene production. The cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is notably lower than using light naphtha, providing a substantial advantage. As a result, companies are investing heavily in new ethylene crackers and expansions to capitalize on the low raw material costs. Notable examples include Chevron Phillips Chemical, which plans to construct a 1.5 million-metric-ton ethylene cracker and downstream polyethylene plants in Texas.

文档显示，页岩气革命对北美化工行业的巨大影响导致了北美企业的丰厚回报，这与欧洲同行的困境形成鲜明对比。这种繁荣得益于天然气液体（尤其是乙烷）的丰富和低成本，成为乙烯生产的首选原料。从乙烷制取乙烯的成本远低于使用轻质石脑油，提供了巨大的优势。因此，企业大量投资新建乙烯裂解装置和扩张，以利用低廉的原材料成本。例如，雪佛龙菲力浦化学公司计划在德克萨斯州的巴顿湾设施建设一座150万吨级的乙烯裂解装置及下游聚乙烯工厂。
