[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Beyond large projects, nearly every producer of ethylene or derivatives is contemplating expansions to take advantage of low raw material costs."
[4] "Shale is also beginning to underpin chemical deals."
[5] "Until 2005, shale deposits - which lie beneath a wide swath of the country - were an eccentric source of natural gas."
[6] "That was about the time that exploration companies perfected horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques to liberate gas that was tightly locked into shale."
[7] "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
[8] "The new output has driven U.S. natural gas prices below $3.00 per million Btu for the first time in more than a decade."
[9] "At more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than five times as expensive as natural gas on an energy content basis."
[10] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."
[11] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
[12] "Although cheap shale gas is now the dominant driver of the U.S. petrochemical industry, the global financial turmoil is still making itself known."
[13] "In particular, the possibility of a Greek debt default last summer caused uncertainty in financial markets and economic slowing."

[17] "Novas Thomson expects North American output of polyethylene, the largest-volume ethylene derivative, to rise 1.5-2.0%."
[18] "The reason for their optimism is a so-called virtuous cycle that will secure a reliable supply of feedstocks."
[19] "With its success tied to petrochemical makers that buy natural gas liquids, the gas industry needs chemical companies to build more capacity."
[20] "Thus, the market will see only incremental capacity additions until 2016."
[21] "These projects will cap an enormous spate of capacity additions."
[22] "North American firms will add about 8.4 million metric tons per year of new ethylene capacity by 2017, IHS's Stekla says, a 35% expansion of the region's output."

The provided literature discusses the transformation of the North American petrochemical industry due to the shale boom. This shift has led to a significant decrease in the cost of natural gas liquids, making them the primary feedstock for petrochemical facilities. Companies such as Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical have announced plans for new complexes focusing on the production of ethylene and related derivatives. This trend indicates a shift in investment towards North America, as the region's petrochemical industry benefits from low raw material costs and a stable supply of feedstocks.

The global financial turmoil, particularly the uncertainty surrounding a possible Greek debt default, has influenced the industry, leading to a slowdown in certain aspects of the business. However, profitability is expected to rebound, with profit margins for ethylene on the spot market reaching their highest level since 1988. The growth in North American output is anticipated to remain consistent with past years, with projections for a 1.5-2.0% increase in polyethylene output.

The shale boom has enabled a virtuous cycle, securing a reliable supply of feedstocks and attracting investments from petrochemical companies. While the market is expected to see incremental capacity additions until 2016, the expansion of ethylene capacity in North America is projected to reach about 8.4 million metric tons per year by 2017, representing a 35% expansion of the region's output. Companies like Chevron Phillips, Dow, Sasol, Shell, Formosa Plastics, and Nova Chemicals have announced new ethylene crackers, with Nova being particularly ambitious in its pursuit of leveraging the shale boom.

Industry experts, such as Nova's president, Grant Thomson, express doubt about the traditional notion of a seven-year petrochemical cycle, suggesting that the industry's resilience and adaptability, particularly in response to the shale boom, have challenged conventional wisdom. The focus on natural gas liquids as a primary feedstock and the anticipation of a potential downturn in the petrochemical business cycle around 2017 highlight the evolving dynamics within the industry.

The literature does not address the specific factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s. The variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts, such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, are not covered in the provided content.

该文献讨论了北美石化行业因页岩热潮而发生的转变。这一转变导致了天然气液体成本的大幅降低，使其成为石化设施的主要原料。诸如雪佛龙菲利普斯化学、杜邦化学、富士塑料、萨索尔和壳牌化学等公司宣布计划建立新的复杂结构，专注于生产乙烯及其衍生物。这表明投资正转向北美，因为该地区的石化行业得益于低廉的原材料成本和稳定的原料供应。

全球金融危机的动荡，特别是希腊债务违约可能性带来的市场不确定性，对行业产生了影响，导致某些业务领域放缓。然而，盈利能力预计会反弹，乙烯现货市场的利润率达到自1988年以来的最高水平。北美输出量的增长预计将保持与过去几年相似的趋势，预计聚乙烯输出量将增长1.5-2.0%。

页岩热潮使得一个所谓的良性循环得以形成，确保了可靠的原料供应，并吸引了石化公司的投资。虽然市场预计在2016年前仅会出现增量产能增加，但北美乙二醇产能的扩张预计将达到每年约840万吨，相当于2017年地区产出的35%扩张。诸如雪佛龙菲利普斯、杜邦、萨索尔、壳牌、富士塑料和诺瓦化学等公司宣布建立新的乙二醇裂解器，其中诺瓦化学在利用页岩热潮方面最为雄心勃勃。

行业专家，如诺瓦化学总裁格兰特·汤姆森，对传统七年石化周期理论持怀疑态度，指出行业韧性以及对页岩热潮响应的适应性挑战了传统的智慧。以天然气液体作为主要原料的重点和对潜在周期性下跌的预期，突显了行业动态的变化。

文献并未探讨推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的具体因素，也未讨论自1980年代以来研究领域的演变。影响钒物种性质的变量，如载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载，不在提供的内容中得到覆盖。
