[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
[4] "At more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than five times as expensive as natural gas on an energy content basis."
[5] "The cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb."
[6] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
[7] "Low natural gas prices have caused gas exploration companies to cut back on drilling."
[8] "The only thing that can meaningfully affect the drilling for gas liquids is if we get a sharp correction in oil prices."
[9] "With its success tied to petrochemical makers that buy natural gas liquids, the gas industry needs chemical companies to build more capacity."
[10] "These projects will cap an enormous spate of capacity additions."

The shale boom is forcing North American petrochemical executives to adapt to new realities, including investing in North America again. Five major companies have announced plans for significant expansions in ethylene and derivative production, utilizing cheap ethane. Shale gas extraction has become a substantial source of natural gas in the US, making it abundant and affordable. This has led to a significant shift in feedstock preference from naphtha to natural gas liquids for ethylene production, with the former being notably more expensive. Ethylene plants now focus more on ethane, resulting in reduced production of coproducts like propylene. However, the gas industry's drilling activities have slowed due to the high oil prices, which maintain a healthy premium for natural gas liquids compared to natural gas, yet offer a discount relative to oil, making them economically viable. The petrochemical sector's success is closely linked to the availability and affordability of natural gas liquids, driving the gas industry to encourage chemical companies to build more capacity. This trend will lead to substantial capacity additions in the coming years, capping a period of rapid expansion.

这场页岩气繁荣正在迫使北美石化行业的高管们适应新的现实，包括重新在北美投资。五大主要公司宣布计划进行大规模的乙烯和衍生产品生产扩张，利用廉价的乙烷。页岩气开采已成为美国天然气的一个重要来源，使其既丰富又经济实惠。这导致从石脑油到天然气液体的生产原料偏好发生了重大转变，后者的价格明显更高。乙烯工厂现在更侧重于乙烷，导致丙烯等副产品的产量减少。然而，由于高油价，油气行业的钻探活动已经放缓，天然气液体与天然气相比维持着健康的溢价，但与石油相比则有折扣，使它们成为经济上可行的原材料。石化行业的成功与天然气液体的可用性和经济性紧密相关，促使油气行业鼓励化工企业增加产能。这一趋势将导致未来几年产能显著增加，标志着一个快速扩张时期的顶峰。
