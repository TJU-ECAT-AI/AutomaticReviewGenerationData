[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the dehydrogenation of ethane (37), propane (8, 9) or isobutane (10), ethylbenzene (1114), and isopropylbenzene (15), and the coupling of methane (1618)."
[2] "In order to reduce energy consumption in ethene production and to obtain high alkene selectivity, we have proposed the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide (reaction 3)."
[3] "The activity of the Ga2O3 and Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was 24 times higher than that without CO2."
[4] "The present study deals with the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene (reaction 3) over several gallium-loaded catalysts. It also describes the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallium-loaded catalysts."
[5] "The presence of CO2 markedly promoted the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3 and Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts."
[6] "The Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst exhibited a high ethene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[7] "Increasing CO2 partial pressure was found to be an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst at 923 K."
[8] "Over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, the deposited carbon in the absence of CO2 seemed to be larger and less reactive than that in the presence of CO2."
[9] "Both CO2 and steam played important roles in the maintenance of catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst."
[10] "For carbon deposition during the reaction, Raman spectra and temperature-programmed reaction with CO2 also indicated the validity of the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2."
[11] "In terms of the transient response to a certain amount of ethene adsorption in the pulsed reaction over Ga2O3-loaded catalysts in the presence and in the absence of CO2, the promoting effect of CO2 was observed in the rapid desorption of ethene from the catalyst surface."
