[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the dehydrogenation of ethane (37), propane (8, 9) or isobutane (10), ethylbenzene (1114), and isopropylbenzene (15), and the coupling of methane (1618). However, the roles of CO2 in these reactions remain unclear."
[2] "We previously reported that Ga2O3 and Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts showed a high catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in the presence of carbon."
[3] "Increasing CO2 partial pressure was found to be an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst at 923 K."
[4] "Over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, the deposited carbon in the absence of CO2 seemed to be larger and less reactive than that in the presence of CO2."

1. Several studies have attempted to utilize carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons, including ethane, propane, isobutane, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, and methane. Despite these efforts, the specific roles of carbon dioxide in these reactions are not well understood.

2. Our previous research has demonstrated that gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and gallium oxide loaded on titanium dioxide (Ga2O3/TiO2) catalysts exhibit a high catalytic efficiency for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene when carbon dioxide is present.

3. The study found that increasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was effective in enhancing the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over a gallium oxide/titanium oxide (Ga2O3/TiO2) catalyst at a temperature of 923 K.

4. It was noted that the amount of deposited carbon on the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst was larger and less reactive in the absence of carbon dioxide compared to when carbon dioxide was present.

1. 近年来，研究人员尝试将二氧化碳作为乙烷、丙烷、异丁烷、乙苯、异丙苯以及甲烷等烃类的脱氢反应中的氧化剂。然而，二氧化碳在这类反应中的作用机制尚未完全明了。

2. 我们之前的研究发现，镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和镓氧化物负载在钛氧化物（Ga2O3/TiO2）上的催化剂，在有碳存在的情况下，表现出高效的乙烷脱氢为乙烯的能力。

3. 研究表明，提高二氧化碳分压能够有效提升923 K下Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂对乙烷脱氢为乙烯的催化效率。

4. 结果显示，没有二氧化碳时，Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂上沉积的碳量更大且活性较低，而在存在二氧化碳的情况下则相反。
