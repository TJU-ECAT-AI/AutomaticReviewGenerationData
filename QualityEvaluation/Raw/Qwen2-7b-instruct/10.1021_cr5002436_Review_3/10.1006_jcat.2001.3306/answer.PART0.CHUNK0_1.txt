[1] "Over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, the presence of CO2 markedly promoted the dehydrogenation of ethane as compared with the absence of CO2."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation under a CO2 atmosphere, the roles of CO2 would be considered as follows:"
[3] "The activity of the Ga2O3 and Ga2O3/TiO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was 24 times higher than that without CO2."
[4] "Increasing CO2 partial pressure was found to be an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst at 923 K."
[5] "Over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, the deposited carbon in the absence of CO2 seemed to be larger and less reactive than that in the presence of CO2."

The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallium-loaded catalysts was examined. It was found that the presence of CO2 significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of ethane compared to its absence. The activity of gallium oxide and gallium oxide/titanium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 was 24 times higher than in the absence of CO2. Increasing the partial pressure of CO2 was identified as an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over a gallium oxide/titanium oxide catalyst at 923 K. Additionally, it was noted that the deposited carbon in the absence of CO2 seemed to be larger and less reactive than that in the presence of CO2.

在对负载有镓催化剂的乙烷脱氢过程中二氧化碳的作用进行了研究。结果发现，与二氧化碳不存在的情况相比，二氧化碳的存在显著提高了乙烷的脱氢效率。镓氧化物和镓氧化物/二氧化钛催化剂在二氧化碳存在的活性是其不存在时的24倍。发现增加二氧化碳的分压是923 K下使用二氧化钛催化剂进行乙烷脱氢至乙烯的有效催化剂。此外，还指出在二氧化碳不存在的情况下沉积的碳似乎比存在二氧化碳时更大且反应性更差。
