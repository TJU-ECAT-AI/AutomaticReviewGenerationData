[1] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3-loaded catalysts was examined. Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst was found to be the most effective for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in the presence of CO2 at 923 K."
[2] "The activity of the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 increased with increases in the partial pressure of CO2."
[3] "Over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, the presence of CO2 markedly promoted the dehydrogenation of ethane as compared with the absence of CO2."
[4] "To maintain high catalytic activity, cofeeding of CO2 and steam was effective in the case of the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst."
[5] "The amount of deposited carbon over the Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was smaller and had a higher reactivity than that formed under Ar."
[6] "In the presence of CO2, a large amount of ethane was dehydrogenated."
[7] "Both CO2 and steam played important roles in the maintenance of catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation started in the 1980s. Since then, research has focused on optimizing catalyst performance by adjusting carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading impact the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. In particular, the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst was found to be highly effective for dehydrogenating ethane to ethene in the presence of CO2 at 923 K. Increasing the partial pressure of CO2 enhances the activity of the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst. CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane, reducing carbon deposition and assisting in the rapid desorption of ethene from the catalyst surface. To maintain high catalytic activity, the use of CO2 and steam together is effective in this process.

自1980年代以来，对以二氧化钒为基础的催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品进行了探索。研究重点集中在通过调整载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载来优化催化剂性能。这些因素影响了催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量影响催化剂的活性和选择性。特别是，发现Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂在923 K下在二氧化碳的存在下对于乙烷脱氢成乙烯非常有效。增加二氧化碳的压力可以增强Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂的活性。二氧化碳促进了乙烷的脱氢，减少了碳沉积，并有助于乙稀从催化剂表面的快速脱附。为了维持高催化活性，二氧化碳和蒸汽的联合使用对此过程是有效的。
