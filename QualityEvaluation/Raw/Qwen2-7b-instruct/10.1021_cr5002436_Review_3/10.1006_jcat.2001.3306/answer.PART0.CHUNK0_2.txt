[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the dehydrogenation of ethane."
[2] "Increasing CO2 partial pressure was found to be an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst at 923 K."
[3] "Over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, the deposited carbon in the absence of CO2 seemed to be larger and less reactive than that in the presence of CO2."
[4] "Both CO2 and steam played important roles in the maintenance of catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective and more environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the complex behavior of vanadium species under various operating conditions. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the activity, stability, and selectivity of these catalysts. For instance, a higher surface area and appropriate metal loading can enhance the dispersion of vanadium species, leading to improved catalytic performance. Different carriers might affect the reaction kinetics and product distribution differently, necessitating careful selection based on specific application requirements. The interaction between vanadium species and the carrier, as well as the support surface area, can influence the reactivity and selectivity towards desired products. Moreover, the optimization of metal loading ensures efficient utilization of the active sites, maximizing the yield of target products while minimizing byproducts. Overall, advancements in catalyst design, synthesis methods, and characterization techniques have contributed to a better understanding of vanadium oxide-based catalysts, enabling their application in various industrial processes, including paraffin dehydrogenation.
