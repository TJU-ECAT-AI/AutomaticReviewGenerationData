The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallium-loaded catalysts was examined. It was found that the presence of CO2 significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of ethane compared to its absence. The activity of gallium oxide and gallium oxide/titanium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 was 24 times higher than in the absence of CO2. Increasing the partial pressure of CO2 was identified as an effective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over a gallium oxide/titanium oxide catalyst at 923 K. Additionally, it was noted that the deposited carbon in the absence of CO2 seemed to be larger and less reactive than that in the presence of CO2.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for cost-effective and more environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the complex behavior of vanadium species under various operating conditions. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the activity, stability, and selectivity of these catalysts. For instance, a higher surface area and appropriate metal loading can enhance the dispersion of vanadium species, leading to improved catalytic performance. Different carriers might affect the reaction kinetics and product distribution differently, necessitating careful selection based on specific application requirements. The interaction between vanadium species and the carrier, as well as the support surface area, can influence the reactivity and selectivity towards desired products. Moreover, the optimization of metal loading ensures efficient utilization of the active sites, maximizing the yield of target products while minimizing byproducts. Overall, advancements in catalyst design, synthesis methods, and characterization techniques have contributed to a better understanding of vanadium oxide-based catalysts, enabling their application in various industrial processes, including paraffin dehydrogenation.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation started in the 1980s. Since then, research has focused on optimizing catalyst performance by adjusting carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading impact the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. In particular, the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst was found to be highly effective for dehydrogenating ethane to ethene in the presence of CO2 at 923 K. Increasing the partial pressure of CO2 enhances the activity of the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst. CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane, reducing carbon deposition and assisting in the rapid desorption of ethene from the catalyst surface. To maintain high catalytic activity, the use of CO2 and steam together is effective in this process.
