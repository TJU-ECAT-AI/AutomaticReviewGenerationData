[1] "In this work, we show for the first time that carbonaceous material, coke, deposited during reaction over VOx/Al2O3 can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[2] "At low reaction temperatures, e.g. 823 K, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network. At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[3] "THz spectroscopy is shown to be a valuable new resource in the catalyst characterisation toolkit. THz-TDS has the capability to distinguish between polyaromatic carbons on the basis of their long-range order and conductivity."
[4] "It is notable that commercially, alkane dehydrogenation also suffers from rapid deactivation at these lower reaction temperatures."
[5] "Additionally, TEM data presented in Section 3.4.2 revealed significant structural similarities between carbonaceous material deposited at high temperature over VOx/Al2O3 and nanostructured carbons, such as CNFs."
[6] "Intriguingly, carbonaceous overlayers formed on mineral surfaces during FisherTropsch-type reactions have also been proposed as the active phase for catalytic reduction reactions in protostellar nebulae."

1. The research in this area has evolved since the 1980s by exploring vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

2. Factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts include their potential cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits compared to precious metals like platinum. Research has aimed to optimize catalyst composition and structure to enhance activity and stability. Variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading can affect the dispersion of vanadium species and the overall catalytic performance.

3. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts can be influenced by carrier type, which affects the support properties like surface area and porosity. Support surface area impacts the availability of active sites and the likelihood of vanadium species clustering. Metal loading determines the concentration of active vanadium species on the support, impacting the catalyst's activity and stability.

4. Rapid deactivation is a common issue encountered in alkane dehydrogenation processes at lower reaction temperatures. This is attributed to the formation of coke deposits on the catalyst surface, which can lead to deactivation. Understanding the factors influencing coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance is crucial for developing more stable and efficient catalysts.

5. The research demonstrates that carbonaceous material, specifically coke, deposited during reaction over vanadium oxide/Al2O3 catalysts can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. The coke's activity is linked to its structural organization, with high-temperature deposition leading to more extensive and highly ordered structures compared to lower temperatures.

6. The phenomenon of carbonaceous deposits providing or enhancing catalytic activity is not limited to dehydrogenation reactions. It extends to various catalytic processes, including reduction reactions in protostellar nebulae and the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds over supported metal catalysts. This highlights the broad applicability of carbonaceous materials in catalysis.
