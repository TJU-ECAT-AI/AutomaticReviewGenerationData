[1] "In this work both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported carbon nanofibres (CNFs) are shown to be active for the dehydrogenation of butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen."
[2] "Their activity in these reactions is shown to be depen- dent upon their structure, with different reaction temperatures yielding structurally different coke deposits."
[3] "In the low-temperature regime, e.g. 823 K, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network. At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[4] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[5] "Relating the catalyst activity shown in Fig. 2, to the nature of the coke, clear trends are apparent."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance the performance of vanadium species in these catalysts.

2. The activity of carbonaceous material deposited on vanadium oxide/Al2O3 catalysts and unsupported carbon nanofibres (CNFs) for butane dehydrogenation depends on their structure. Different reaction temperatures lead to the formation of structurally distinct coke deposits on these catalysts.

3. In the low-temperature regime (e.g., 823 K), the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network. In contrast, at high reaction temperatures (e.g., 973 K), more extensive and highly ordered coke deposits are formed.

4. The high-temperature regime (e.g., 973 K) is characterized by the deposition of highly ordered coke deposits on the catalyst surfaces. These deposits are crucial for the enhanced activity observed at these temperatures.

5. The relationship between the structure of the coke deposits and the catalyst activity provides clear trends that are evident in the results presented in Figure 2.

1. 对于正构烷烃脱氢化，探索使用钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬酸盐氧化物（CrOx）的替代品，主要是为了寻求更高效且成本效益更高的催化剂。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究取得了显著进展，着重优化载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等参数，以提升钒物种在这些催化剂中的性能。

2. 在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上沉积的碳质材料以及未支持的碳纳米纤维（CNFs）对正丁烷脱氢化的作用依赖于它们的结构。不同的反应温度会导致形成结构各异的焦炭沉积。

3. 在低温区域（例如，823 K），焦炭结构较差，不呈现扩展的石墨烯网络状。而在高温区域（例如，973 K），则形成了更为广泛且高度有序的焦炭沉积。

4. 在高温区域（例如，973 K），高度有序的焦炭沉积在催化剂表面上形成。这些沉积是高温下观察到的增强活性的关键因素。

5. 焦炭沉积结构与催化剂活性之间的关系提供了在图2中展示的结果中明显可见的趋势。
