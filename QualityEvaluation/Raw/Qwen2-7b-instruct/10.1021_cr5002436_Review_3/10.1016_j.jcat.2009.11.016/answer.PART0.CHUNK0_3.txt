[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes are of signif- icant industrial importance."
[2] "In this work, we show for the first time that carbonaceous material, coke, deposited during reaction over VOx/Al2O3 can act as an active catalyst in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[3] "Significantly, from between 80 and 110 min on stream at 973 K, selectivity, conversion and yield all remain constant and do not deactivate with increasing exposure to n-butane."
[4] "However, in that study the possible catalytic action of the coke was not considered."
[5] "Increasing the selectivity of zeolite catalysts through carbon deposition is a strategy employed industrially in xylene isomerisation."
[6] "Additionally, THz spectroscopy is shown to be a valuable new resource in the catalyst characterisation toolkit."

Research into vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. The focus has shifted towards understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species on different supports, carrier types, and metal loadings. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the structure and activity of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the study demonstrates that carbonaceous material, specifically coke, deposited during reaction over vanadium oxide on alumina can act as an active catalyst in the dehydrogenation of n-butane. The activity of coke deposits is confirmed through a comparison with unfunctionalized carbon nanofibers, which exhibit almost identical activity. The research highlights the importance of carbon-based materials in dehydrogenation reactions and showcases the potential of terahertz spectroscopy in catalyst characterization. The study also addresses the deactivation issues encountered at lower reaction temperatures in commercial alkane dehydrogenation processes.

自1980年代以来，对以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬酸盐的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究已经显著发展。研究重点转向了理解不同支撑物、载体类型和金属负载对五价钒物种性质的影响。诸如载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素会影响这些催化剂中五价钒物种的结构和活性。例如，研究表明，在铝酸盐上反应过程中沉积的碳质材料，尤其是焦炭，可以作为非氧化性脱氢化n-丁烷的活性催化剂。通过与未功能化的碳纳米纤维进行比较，证实了焦炭沉积物的活性。研究还通过对比焦炭和五氧化二钒/氧化铝催化剂在973K下的表现，展示了焦炭在脱氢反应中的潜在作用。此外，研究强调了碳基材料在脱氢反应中的活性，并展示了太赫兹光谱在催化剂表征方面的潜在价值。研究也指出，在商业烷烃脱氢过程中遇到的快速失活问题。
