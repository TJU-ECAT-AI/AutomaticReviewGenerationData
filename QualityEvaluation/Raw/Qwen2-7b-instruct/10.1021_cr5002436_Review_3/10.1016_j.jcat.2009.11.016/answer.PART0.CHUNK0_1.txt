[1] "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s."
[2] "In this work, both carbonaceous material deposited on vanadium oxide/alumina catalysts during reaction and unsupported carbon nanofibres are shown to be active for the dehydrogenation of butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen."
[3] "The role of carbonaceous deposits in dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions has been extensively researched. In industrial alkane dehydrogenation, significant coke deposition causes rapid deactivation of the catalyst."
[4] "In contrast to many other reaction systems, in dehydrogenation reactions, polyaromatic coke deposits are not always directly implicated in catalyst deactivation."
[5] "Recent studies have demonstrated that such large ensembles play only a minor role in deactivation during n-butane dehydrogenation."
[6] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, such carbonaceous deposits are not only not implicated in catalyst deactivation, but instead have been suggested as being catalytically active in their own right."
[7] "Notably, significant deactivation was not observed over a period of 100 h."
[8] "In this work, we have applied a number of complementary techniques to the study of coke formed over vanadium oxide/alumina during butane dehydrogenation. One such method is terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, and this work represents the first application of this spectroscopy in the study of coke."
