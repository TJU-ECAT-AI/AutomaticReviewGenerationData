[1] "The dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was investigated over various solid acid catalysts such as zeolites and silicaalumina at temperatures ranging from 453 to 573 K under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the dehydration process."
[3] "H-mordenites were the most active for the dehydration."
[4] "It was suggested that the catalyst activity could be correlated with the number of strong Brnsted acid sites in the catalyst."
[5] "The H-mordenite was more stable with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90 than with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20."

The investigation of dehydration of ethanol into ethylene over various solid acid catalysts, including zeolites and silicaalumina, under atmospheric pressure and temperatures ranging from 453 to 573 K, revealed that H-mordenites were the most active catalysts for this process. The catalytic activity was found to correlate with the number of strong Brnsted acid sites within the catalyst. Moreover, it was noted that H-mordenites with a specific SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90 showed better stability compared to those with a ratio of 20.

在453至573 K的温度范围内，在大气压下对不同固体酸催化剂（如沸石和硅铝酸盐）进行的乙醇脱水成乙烯的研究发现，蒙脱石是此过程中最活跃的催化剂。催化活性与催化剂中的强布兰斯德酸位点数量相关。此外，指出SiO2/Al2O3比为90的蒙脱石具有更好的稳定性，与比率为20的蒙脱石相比。
