[1] "In the present study, the dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was investigated over various solid acid catalysts such as zeolites and silicaalumina at temperatures ranging from 453 to 573 K under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the dehydration process. H-mordenites were the most active for the dehydration."
[3] "The catalyst activity during the dehydration could be correlated with the number of strong Brnsted acid sites."
[4] "The H-mordenite was more stable with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90 than with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation was driven by the need to find cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on improving catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was studied over different solid acid catalysts, with H-mordenites showing the highest activity. This suggests that the type of catalyst significantly influences the efficiency of the dehydration process.

3. The activity of the catalyst during the dehydration process is closely linked to the presence of strong Brnsted acid sites. These sites are essential for the effective conversion of ethanol to ethylene.

4. H-mordenite catalysts are more stable when the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is 90 compared to a ratio of 20. This indicates that the composition of the catalyst can impact its performance and longevity under dehydration conditions.

1. 对于石蜡脱氢，使用氧化钒基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品进行探索，主要是为了寻找成本效益高且环境友好的催化剂。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究有了显著进展，重点是提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载等因素对钒物种在这些催化剂中的性质和行为至关重要。

2. 在不同固体酸催化剂上进行了乙醇脱水为乙烯的研究，氢莫来石显示出最高的活性。这表明催化剂类型对脱水过程的效率有重大影响。

3. 催化剂在脱水过程中活动性的关键在于强布兰斯特酸位的存在。这些位点对于有效将乙醇转化为乙烯至关重要。

4. 当SiO2/Al2O3的比例为90时，氢莫来石催化剂比比例为20时更稳定。这意味着催化剂的组成可以影响其性能和寿命，在脱水条件下。
