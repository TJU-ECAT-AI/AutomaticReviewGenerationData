[1] "Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the dehydration process."
[2] "H-mordenites were the most active for the dehydration."
[3] "It was suggested that the catalyst activity could be correlated with the number of strong Brnsted acid sites in the catalyst."
[4] "The H-mordenite was more stable with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90 than with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20."

The dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was studied over various solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites and silica-alumina, at temperatures from 453 to 573 K under atmospheric pressure. Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the dehydration process. H-mordenites showed the highest activity for the dehydration, and the catalyst activity was found to correlate with the number of strong Brnsted acid sites. Additionally, H-mordenite exhibited better stability with a higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.

在453到573 K的温度范围内，在大气压力下，对各种固体酸催化剂（如沸石和硅铝酸盐）进行乙醇脱水研究。乙二醇通过乙醚在脱水过程中产生乙烯。莫登石显示出最高的脱水活性，并且催化剂活性与催化剂中的强布恩斯酸位点数量相关。此外，当SiO2/Al2O3比值较高时，莫登石表现出更好的稳定性。
