[1] "The dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was investigated over various solid acid catalysts such as zeolites and silicaalumina at temperatures ranging from 453 to 573 K under atmospheric pressure."
[2] "Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the dehydration process."
[3] "H-mordenites were the most active for the dehydration."
[4] "It was suggested that the catalyst activity could be correlated with the number of strong Brnsted acid sites in the catalyst."
[5] "Further, the H-mordenite was more stable with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90 than with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20."

The investigation of dehydration of ethanol into ethylene over solid acid catalysts was conducted under specific conditions. Zeolites and silicaalumina were utilized as catalysts, with the process occurring at temperatures ranging from 453 to 573 K under atmospheric pressure. Ethylene production occurred through the formation of diethyl ether during the dehydration process. H-mordenites demonstrated the highest activity for this transformation. The catalyst's efficiency was linked to the presence of strong Brnsted acid sites. Moreover, the H-mordenite showed greater stability with a higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90 compared to a ratio of 20.

对在特定条件下使用固体酸催化剂（如沸石和硅铝酸盐）进行乙醇脱水成乙烯的研究进行了考察。在453至573 K的温度范围内，在大气压下进行实验。脱水过程中，通过二乙醚形成乙炔。具有强布郎斯特酸位点的催化剂显示出最高活性。H-蒙脱石在SiO2/Al2O3比例为90时表现出比比例为20时更高的稳定性。
