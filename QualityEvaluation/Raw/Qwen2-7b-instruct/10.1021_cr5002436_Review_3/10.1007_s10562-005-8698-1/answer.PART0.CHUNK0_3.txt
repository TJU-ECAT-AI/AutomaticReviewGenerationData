[1] "Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the dehydration process."
[2] "H-mordenites were the most active for the dehydration."
[3] "The catalyst activity during the dehydration could be correlated with the number of strong Brnsted acid sites."
[4] "The H-mordenite was more stable with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90 than with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20."

The dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was studied over various solid acid catalysts, with H-mordenites showing the highest activity. The catalyst's performance was linked to the quantity of strong Brnsted acid sites it possessed. Moreover, H-mordenites demonstrated greater stability when the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio was 90 compared to a ratio of 20.

在研究中，通过不同固体酸催化剂对乙醇脱水成乙烯的过程，发现H莫来石表现出最高活性。催化剂的性能与其中强布伦斯特酸位点的数量相关。此外，当SiO2/Al2O3比例为90时，H莫来石比比例为20时更稳定。
