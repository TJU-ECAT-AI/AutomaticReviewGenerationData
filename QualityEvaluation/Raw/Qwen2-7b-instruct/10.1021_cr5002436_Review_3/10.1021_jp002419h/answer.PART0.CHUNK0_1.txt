[1] "The Mo surface densities for all MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo contents below 11 wt % MoO3 are below this monolayer capacity."
[2] "The bulk structures of pure ZrO2 and of supported MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were determined by powder X-ray diffraction."
[3] "X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figures 2A for the ZrO2 support treated in air at 723, 773, or 873 K."
[4] "The incorporation of cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Y3+, La3+, Ce4+, W6+, and V5+, into ZrO2 inhibits the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2 and the conversion of tetragonal ZrO2 to the monoclinic phase."
[5] "The formation of Zr(MoO4)2 via solid-state reactions of MoO3 and ZrO2 was studied using an intimate physical mixture of crystalline MoO3 and ZrOx(OH)4-2x with the expected stoichiometry of Zr(MoO4)2 (Mo/Zr = 2)."
[6] "The stable structure of Zr(MoO4)2 at 973 K is hexagonal with two-dimensional networks of MoO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra (as illustrated in Figure 4)."
[7] "For samples with low Mo concentrations (11 wt %), neither Raman spectroscopy nor X-ray diffraction detected bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures because the MoOx surface density of these samples remained well below the monolayer value of 5 Mo/nm2 at all treatment temperatures."

1. The Mo surface densities for MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo contents below 11 wt % MoO3 are below the monolayer capacity of 5 Mo/nm2.
2. The bulk structures of ZrO2 and MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were determined using powder X-ray diffraction.
3. X-ray diffraction patterns were used to analyze the ZrO2 support treated in air at various temperatures.
4. The addition of certain cations inhibits the crystallization of ZrO2 and converts tetragonal ZrO2 to monoclinic phase.
5. Solid-state reactions between MoO3 and ZrO2 were studied to form Zr(MoO4)2 using a physical mixture of crystalline materials.
6. The stable structure of Zr(MoO4)2 at 973 K is hexagonal with a network of MoO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra.
7. For MoOx/ZrO2 samples with low Mo concentrations, no bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures were detected due to MoOx surface densities below 5 Mo/nm2 at all treatment temperatures.

1. MoOx/ZrO2样品中Mo含量低于11wt% MoO3时，Mo表面密度低于每平方纳米5个Mo的单层容量。
2. ZrO2和MoOx/ZrO2催化剂的结构通过粉末X射线衍射确定。
3. 使用X射线衍射图案分析了在不同温度下处理的ZrO2支持。
4. 某些离子的添加抑制了ZrO2的结晶，并将四方ZrO2转化为单斜相。
5. 使用具有预期Zr(MoO4)2（Mo/Zr=2）化学式的结晶MoO3和ZrOx(OH)4-2x的物理混合物研究了MoO3和ZrO2之间的固态反应以形成Zr(MoO4)2。
6. 在973 K下稳定的Zr(MoO4)2结构是六角形的，由MoO4四面体和ZrO6八面体组成的二维网络。
7. 对于低Mo浓度的MoOx/ZrO2样品，由于所有处理温度下MoOx表面密度均低于每平方纳米5个Mo的单层值，因此未检测到任何Bulk MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2结构。
