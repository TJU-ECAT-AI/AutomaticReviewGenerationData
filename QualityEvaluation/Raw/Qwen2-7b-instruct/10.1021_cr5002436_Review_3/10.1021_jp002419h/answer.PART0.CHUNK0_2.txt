[1] "Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions."
[2] "The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support."
[3] "The Mo surface densities for all MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo contents below 11 wt % MoO3 are below this monolayer capacity"
[4] "The incorporation of cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Y3+, La3+, Ce4+, W6+, and V5+, into ZrO2 inhibits the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2 and the conversion of tetragonal ZrO2 to the monoclinic phase."
[5] "Bulk MoO3 is expected to form in samples with higher MoOx surface densities; this was detected by Raman in the 20.7 wt % MoOx/ZrO2 sample."

1. Supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been commonly utilized in selective oxidation reactions.
2. The structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide evolves through a series of stages, transitioning from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers, and eventually to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures. This transformation is influenced by the molybdenum surface density, treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support.
3. Mo surface densities on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts below 5 Mo/nm² are below the monolayer capacity.
4. Adding cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Y3+, La3+, Ce4+, W6+, and V5+ to ZrO2 impedes the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2 and its subsequent conversion to the monoclinic phase.
5. Bulk MoO3 is anticipated to form in samples with higher MoOx surface densities, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy in the 20.7 wt % MoOx/ZrO2 sample.

1. 支持的钒氧化物催化剂已被广泛应用于选择性氧化反应中。
2. ZrO2支持的钼氧化物结构从孤立的MoOx阶段发展到二维寡聚体，最终形成MoO3或Zr(MoO4)2的宏观结构。这一过程受到钼表面密度、处理温度以及支持体活性的影响。
3. MoOx/ZrO2催化剂上的钼表面密度低于5 Mo/nm²时，其处于单层容量以下。
4. 添加镁离子、钙离子、Y3+、La3+、Ce4+、W6+和V5+等阳离子到ZrO2中可以抑制非晶态ZrOx(OH)4-2x的结晶为四方晶型ZrO2，并阻止其向单斜晶型转化。
5. 预期在钼氧化物表面密度较高的样品中形成bulk MoO3，在20.7 wt % MoOx/ZrO2样品中通过拉曼光谱得到了证实。
