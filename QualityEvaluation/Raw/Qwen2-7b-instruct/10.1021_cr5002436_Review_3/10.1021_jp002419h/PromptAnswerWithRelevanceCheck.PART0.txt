<p>The thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes has led to extensive evaluation of oxide catalysts for these reactions. Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature.</p>
<p>The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support.</p>
<p>Isolated tetrahedral MoO4, two-dimensional polymolybdates, tetragonalpyramidal OMoO4, and crystalline MoO3 and Zr(MoO4)2 species were detected by Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopies and by X-ray diffraction in MoOx/ZrO2 samples with 144 wt % MoO3 after treatment in air at 393973 K.</p>
<p>For Mo surface densities below the polymolybdate monolayer values (5 Mo/nm2), no crystalline MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 were detected by these methods after thermal treatment at 393973 K.</p>
<p>The size of these two-dimensional polymolybdate domains increased with increasing Mo surface density; this process led to a shift in the ν(MoO) Raman band, to changes in the near-edge X-ray absorption spectra, and to a decrease in the UVvisible edge energy with increasing surface density.</p>
<p>Domain growth occurred via oligomerization of isolated tetrahedral MoOx as thermal treatments decreased the ZrO2 surface area available to disperse the MoOx species.</p>
<p>This formation of MoOMo linkages was reversed at higher temperatures (973 K), which led to the dissociation on MoOMo bonds in polymolybdates and to the formation of tetragonalpyramidal OMoO4 species.</p>
<p>Crystalline MoO3 and Zr(MoO4)2 were formed in samples with Mo surface densities above 5 Mo/nm2.</p>
<p>Treatment in air at temperatures below 873 K leads to the preferential formation of MoO3, while higher temperatures favor the solid-state reaction between MoO3 and ZrO2 to form exclusively Zr(MoO4)2.</p>

<p>The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the impact of various factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables like carrier type and support surface area influence the dispersion of metal species, affecting their reactivity and stability. Metal loading determines the amount of active site available for catalytic reactions. The structure of supported vanadium oxides evolves from isolated species to two-dimensional oligomers and eventually to bulk structures, depending on the metal surface density, treatment temperature, and support reactivity. The evolution of structure leads to changes in spectroscopic properties and catalytic activity. Higher metal surface densities facilitate the formation of more complex structures, such as polymolybdate domains, while treatment temperatures can induce transformations between different structures. The preference for MoO3 formation versus Zr(MoO4)2 formation depends on the treatment temperature, with MoO3 being more likely at lower temperatures and Zr(MoO4)2 at higher temperatures.</p>

<p>范德华烷烃氧化脱氢的热力学可行性推动了基于氧化钒催化剂的研究，作为铂和CrOx的替代品用于芳烃脱氢。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展，关注的是载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的影响。变量如载体类型和支撑面积影响金属物种的分散性，影响其反应性和稳定性。金属负载决定了活性位点的数量，影响催化反应。支持的钒氧化物结构从孤立物种演变到二维寡聚体，最终演变成固体结构，这取决于金属表面积密度、处理温度和支持反应性。结构的演变导致光谱属性和催化活性的变化。更高的金属表面积密度促进了更复杂结构（如多钼酸盐域）的形成，而处理温度可以诱导结构之间的转变。在较低温度下更倾向于形成MoO3，在较高温度下更倾向于形成Zr(MoO4)2，这种倾向依赖于处理温度。</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. The surface density of vanadium oxides on supports plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Factors such as carrier type and support surface area impact the dispersion of vanadium species, affecting their reactivity and stability. Metal loading determines the concentration of active sites, impacting the catalytic performance. Studies have shown that the thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions has driven extensive evaluations of oxide catalysts, including supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts are notably influenced by the surface density of molybdenum oxides, which can be adjusted through modifications in the catalyst preparation process. For instance, samples with low molybdenum content exhibit characteristics indicative of isolated tetrahedral molybdenum oxide species, whereas higher molybdenum content leads to the formation of two-dimensional polymolybdate structures and eventually bulk molybdenum oxide or molybdenum zirconate compounds. The crystallization behavior of zirconia supports and the formation of specific molybdenum zirconate phases are also influenced by treatment temperatures and the presence of certain cations. The structure of catalysts evolves from isolated molybdenum oxide species to two-dimensional oligomers and potentially to crystalline structures depending on the molybdenum surface density and treatment conditions. The nature of these structures impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
