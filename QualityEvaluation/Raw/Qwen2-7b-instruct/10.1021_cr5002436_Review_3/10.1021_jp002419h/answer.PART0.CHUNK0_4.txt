<p>The thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes has led to extensive evaluation of oxide catalysts for these reactions. Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature.</p>
<p>Mo surface densities for all MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo contents below 11 wt % MoO3 are below this monolayer capacity</p>
<p>The incorporation of cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Y3+, La3+, Ce4+, W6+, and V5+, into ZrO2 inhibits the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2 and the conversion of tetragonal ZrO2 to the monoclinic phase.</p>
<p>For samples with low Mo concentrations (11 wt %), neither Raman spectroscopy nor X-ray diffraction detected bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures because the MoOx surface density of these samples remained well below the monolayer value of 5 Mo/nm2 at all treatment temperatures.</p>
<p>Crystalline MoO3 is expected to form in samples with higher MoOx surface densities; this was detected by Raman in the 20.7 wt % MoOx/ZrO2 sample.</p>
<p>After treatment at 723 or 773 K, the frequency of the MoO stretching band at 1001 cm-1 was slightly shifted to 1002 and 1003 cm-1.</p>
<p>A new band at 817 cm-1 emerged after treatment of 973 K along with a new band at 1006 cm-1. These two new bands reflect the formation of tetragonalpyramidal OMoO4 species.</p>
<p>The weakening of the 833 cm-1 band after treatment at 973 K suggests the formation of tetragonalpyramidal OMoO4 species via dissociation of MoOMo bonds in polymolybdate species.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. The surface density of vanadium oxides on supports plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Factors such as carrier type and support surface area impact the dispersion of vanadium species, affecting their reactivity and stability. Metal loading determines the concentration of active sites, impacting the catalytic performance. Studies have shown that the thermodynamic feasibility of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions has driven extensive evaluations of oxide catalysts, including supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts are notably influenced by the surface density of molybdenum oxides, which can be adjusted through modifications in the catalyst preparation process. For instance, samples with low molybdenum content exhibit characteristics indicative of isolated tetrahedral molybdenum oxide species, whereas higher molybdenum content leads to the formation of two-dimensional polymolybdate structures and eventually bulk molybdenum oxide or molybdenum zirconate compounds. The crystallization behavior of zirconia supports and the formation of specific molybdenum zirconate phases are also influenced by treatment temperatures and the presence of certain cations. The structure of catalysts evolves from isolated molybdenum oxide species to two-dimensional oligomers and potentially to crystalline structures depending on the molybdenum surface density and treatment conditions. The nature of these structures impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

自1980年代以来，范德华氧化物催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的探索已经取得了显著进展。研究集中在理解载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的影响。范德华氧化物的表面密度在确定氧化脱氢反应催化剂的有效性方面起着关键作用。载体类型和支持表面面积影响了钒物种的分散，从而影响其活性和稳定性。金属负载决定了活性位点的浓度，影响催化性能。研究表明，氧化脱氢反应的热力学可行性驱动了对氧化物催化剂的广泛评估，包括支持的钒和钼氧化物。丙烷氧化脱氢速率和选择性在钼氧化物/ZrO2催化剂上的表现明显受钼氧化物表面密度的影响，可以通过调整催化剂制备过程来改变钼含量和处理温度。例如，低钼含量样品显示出孤立四面体钼氧化物物种的特征，而高钼含量导致二维多钼酸盐结构的形成，最终可能形成钼氧化物或钼锆化合物。氧化锆支持的结晶行为以及钼锆化合物的形成也受到处理温度和某些离子存在的影响。催化剂的结构从孤立的钼氧化物物种发展到二维寡聚体，并且在适当的条件下可能形成晶体结构，这取决于钼表面密度和处理条件。这些结构的性质影响了氧化脱氢反应的催化活性和选择性。
