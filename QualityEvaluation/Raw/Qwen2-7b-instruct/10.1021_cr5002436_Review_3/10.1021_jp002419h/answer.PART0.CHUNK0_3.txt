[1] "Supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides have been widely used for selective oxidation reactions."
[2] "Recently, propane ODH rates and selectivity on MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were shown to depend strongly on the MoOx surface density, which was varied by changing the Mo content and the catalyst treatment temperature."
[3] "The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide from isolated MoOx to two-dimensional oligomers and ultimately to MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 bulk structures depends on the Mo surface density, the treatment temperature, and the reactivity of the support."
[4] "ZrO2-supported MoOx with Mo surface densities ranging from 0.35 to 50 Mo/nm2 were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy in order to understand how their structures evolved during catalyst synthesis and pretreatment."
[5] "The Mo surface densities for all MoOx/ZrO2 samples with Mo contents below 11 wt % MoO3 are below this monolayer capacity"
[6] "The bulk structures of pure ZrO2 and of supported MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts were determined by powder X-ray diffraction."
[7] "X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figures 2A for the ZrO2 support treated in air at 723, 773, or 873 K."
[8] "The incorporation of cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Y3+, La3+, Ce4+, W6+, and V5+, into ZrO2 inhibits the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2 and the conversion of tetragonal ZrO2 to the monoclinic phase."

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their potential for selective oxidation reactions. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on catalyst development and optimization.

2. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables affect the structure and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts.

3. The evolution of the structure of ZrO2-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts, particularly in relation to the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, depends on the molybdenum surface density, treatment temperature, and reactivity of the support material.

4. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were utilized to study the structural changes of MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts during synthesis and pretreatment. The MoOx surface density on ZrO2 varied widely, affecting the catalyst's performance.

5. The MoOx surface density on ZrO2 below the monolayer capacity (5 Mo/nm2) for all MoOx/ZrO2 samples with a Mo content below 11 wt % MoO3 was found to be below the monolayer coverage limit.

6. Powder X-ray diffraction was employed to determine the bulk structures of ZrO2 and supported MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts, revealing insights into their crystallinity and composition.

7. The use of cations such as magnesium (Mg2+), calcium (Ca2+), yttrium (Y3+), lanthanum (La3+), cerium (Ce4+), tungsten (W6+), and vanadium (V5+) inhibited the crystallization of amorphous ZrOx(OH)4-2x into tetragonal ZrO2.

8. Solid-state reactions of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) with zirconia (ZrO2) were studied using an intimate physical mixture of crystalline MoO3 and ZrOx(OH)4-2x, leading to the formation of Zr(MoO4)2 through a series of thermal treatments.

9. The stable structure of Zr(MoO4)2 at 973 K featured a hexagonal arrangement of MoO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra, forming two-dimensional networks.

10. In tetrahedral MX4 species with Td symmetry, all four normal modes of vibration are Raman-active, while in species with lower symmetry, such as OMoO3 in Zr(MoO4)2, these modes split into two modes (A1 + E).

12. For catalyst samples with low molybdenum concentrations (11 wt %), neither Raman spectroscopy nor X-ray diffraction detected bulk MoO3 or Zr(MoO4)2 structures due to the MoOx surface density remaining below the monolayer value at all treatment temperatures.

13. After thermal treatment at 773 and 873 K, the MoO stretching band frequency at 1001 cm-1 shifted slightly to 1002 and 1003 cm-1.
