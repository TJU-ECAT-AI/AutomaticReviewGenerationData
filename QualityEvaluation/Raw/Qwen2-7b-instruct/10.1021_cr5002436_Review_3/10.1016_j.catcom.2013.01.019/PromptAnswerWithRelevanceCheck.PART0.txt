The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been influenced by advancements in understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species, particularly in relation to carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Research has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on optimizing these factors to enhance catalyst efficiency and stability. Vanadium species' characteristics are crucial in determining the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation processes. The use of different carriers, supports with varied surface areas, and precise metal loadings can significantly affect the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Studies have shown that the presence of a hard template during the synthesis of gallium oxide materials helps maintain the mesopore structure during recrystallization, contributing to higher stability and resistance to deactivation. Additionally, the incorporation of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of alkanes leads to enhanced olefin yields and reduced coke deposition through participating in specific chemical reactions, such as the reverse water-gas shift and Boudouard reactions. The catalytic properties of mesoporous oxides, like gallium oxide, have been extensively studied in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, demonstrating promising outcomes in terms of product selectivity and stability over multiple reaction cycles. The results highlight the potential of these materials in alternative dehydrogenation pathways, offering viable alternatives to traditional catalysts.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements focusing on optimizing carrier types, support surface areas, and metal loadings to enhance the performance of vanadium species in these catalysts. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the use of specific carriers can affect the dispersion of vanadium species, thereby impacting their reactivity and stability. Similarly, the surface area of the support influences the accessibility of reactants and products, affecting the overall efficiency of the catalytic process. Metal loadings determine the concentration of active vanadium sites, which in turn affects the catalytic activity and selectivity. The high stability of Ga2O3m under the operation conditions indicates that it can maintain its catalytic performance even after multiple dehydrogenation cycles, suggesting a potential application as a robust catalyst in paraffin dehydrogenation processes.
