1. The hydrolysis and polymerization of transition-metal alkoxides are harder to control compared to silica alkoxides, resulting in poor mesopore structure and low thermal stability of final solids after the removal of templating agent.

2. The new method of gallium oxide synthesis using a hard template provides a stable support, which remains after high temperature crystallization.

3. CO2, formed as a valuable by-product, can be utilized in chemical synthesis.

4. In the dehydrogenation of propane, CO2 enhances olefin yield and suppresses coke deposition through participation in reverse water-gas shift and Boudouard reactions.

5. During 4 hours at 823 K, propene was produced with a yield of 10-18% and high selectivity of 91-95%.

6. Pure mesoporous gallium oxide showed better resistance to deactivation during the DHP-CO2 process compared to gallium oxide synthesized without a hard template.

7. For dehydrogenation of propane, α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibited higher selectivity compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3.

8. Over mesoporous oxides, propene was obtained with slightly higher selectivity compared to the reference Ga2O3-t sample.

1. 对于过渡金属醇盐的水解和聚合的控制比硅醇盐更困难，导致在模板剂移除后最终固体具有较差的介孔结构和较低的热稳定性。

2. 使用硬模板的新镓氧化物合成方法提供了稳定的支撑，该支撑在高温结晶后仍存在。

3. 形成的二氧化碳可以作为有价值的副产品用于化学合成。

4. 在使用镓含材料进行丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳通过参与逆向水煤气变换和布杜瓦德反应增强了烯烃产率并抑制了焦炭沉积。

5. 在823 K下4小时内，丙烯的产生量为10-18%，选择性为91-95%。

6. 纯介孔镓氧化物在DHP-CO2过程中显示出更好的抗失活性能，与没有硬模板的镓氧化物相比。

7. 对于丙烷脱氢，α-和β-Ga2O3多晶相的产率选择性高于δ-和γ-Ga2O3。

8. 在介孔氧化物上，与参考Ga2O3-t样品相比，丙烯的选择性略高。
