[1] "Taking into account the advantages of the nanocasting route and the promising catalytic performance of Ga-containing materials, we decided to prepare thermally stable ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials using CMK-3 as a hard template."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2), pure mesoporous Ga2O3m and mixed GaAlO(Al/Ga=1:4) exhibit a promising catalytic performance."
[3] "Over the most active materials, during 4 h on stream at 823 K, propene was produced with the yield of 1018% and high selectivity of 9195%."
[4] "However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."

1. The decision to prepare thermally stable ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials using CMK-3 as a hard template was made considering the benefits of the nanocasting route and the catalytic performance of gallium-containing materials.

2. Pure mesoporous Ga2O3m and mixed GaAlO with an atomic ratio of 1:4 show promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

3. During 4 hours of operation at 823 K, the yield of propene was 1018% and the selectivity was 9195%.

4. The mesoporous Ga2O3m material demonstrates high stability under operation conditions, regaining its catalytic performance quickly after regeneration with air.
