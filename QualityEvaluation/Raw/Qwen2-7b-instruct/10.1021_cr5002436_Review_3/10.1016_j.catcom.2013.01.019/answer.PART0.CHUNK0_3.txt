[1] "The synthesis of ordered mesoporous inorganic materials has attracted a lot of scientific interest due to their uniform mesopore sizes, high specific surface areas and ease of surface functionalization,which are features important in catalytic applications."
[2] "In the case of Ga2O3, the presence of hard template suppresses collapse of mesopore structure that typically occurs during gallium oxide recrystallization."
[3] "Over the most active materials, during 4 h on stream at 823 K, propene was produced with the yield of 1018% and high selectivity of 9195%."
[4] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]."
[5] "However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."

1. The synthesis of ordered mesoporous inorganic materials has gained significant scientific interest due to their uniform pore sizes, high surface areas, and ease of surface modification, which are crucial attributes for catalytic applications. 
2. The use of a hard template in the synthesis of gallium oxide helps maintain the mesopore structure during recrystallization, which is typically lost.
3. When tested, the most active gallium oxide materials showed propene production yields of 10-18% and selectivities of 91-95% after 4 hours at 823 K.
4. In the propane dehydrogenation process in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2), the selectivity towards propene is influenced by two factors: the acidity of the gallium oxide phase composition or the support properties.
5. Upon short air regeneration, the mesoporous gallium oxide material almost fully regains its catalytic efficiency.
