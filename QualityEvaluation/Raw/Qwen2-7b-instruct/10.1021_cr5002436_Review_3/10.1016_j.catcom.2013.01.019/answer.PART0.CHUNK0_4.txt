<p>The synthesis of ordered mesoporous inorganic materials has attracted a lot of scientific interest due to their uniform mesopore sizes, high specific surface areas and ease of surface functionalization,which are features important in catalytic applications.</p>
<p>In the case of Ga2O3, the presence of hard template suppresses collapse of mesopore structure that typically occurs during gallium oxide recrystallization.</p>
<p>Over the most active materials, during 4 h on stream at 823 K, propene was produced with the yield of 1018% and high selectivity of 9195%.</p>
<p>Moreover,pure mesoporous gallium oxide exerted a higher resistance on deactivation during the DHP-CO2 process in comparison with gallium oxide prepared without a hard template.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the high catalytic performance of pure Ga2O3 and mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 materials is attributed to the surface gallium sites with a relatively weak acidity.</p>
<p>During 4 h of process over mesoporous oxides, propene was obtained with slightly higher selectivity than over the reference Ga2O3-t sample.</p>
<p>Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied temperatures.</p>
<p>In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking.</p>
<p>This suggests a high stability of Ga2O3m under the operation conditions.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements focusing on optimizing carrier types, support surface areas, and metal loadings to enhance the performance of vanadium species in these catalysts. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the use of specific carriers can affect the dispersion of vanadium species, thereby impacting their reactivity and stability. Similarly, the surface area of the support influences the accessibility of reactants and products, affecting the overall efficiency of the catalytic process. Metal loadings determine the concentration of active vanadium sites, which in turn affects the catalytic activity and selectivity. The high stability of Ga2O3m under the operation conditions indicates that it can maintain its catalytic performance even after multiple dehydrogenation cycles, suggesting a potential application as a robust catalyst in paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品进行探索，以寻找更经济和环保的催化剂。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，着重于优化载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载量，以提高这些催化剂中钒物种的性能。载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载量等因素影响着这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，特定载体的使用可以影响钒物种的分散性，从而影响它们的反应性和稳定性。同样，支持表面的面积影响反应物和产物的可接近性，进而影响催化过程的整体效率。金属负载量决定了活性钒位的数量，这反过来又影响催化活性和选择性。Ga2O3m在操作条件下的高稳定性表明，即使经过多次脱氢周期后，它仍能保持其催化性能，这表明其可能在石蜡脱氢过程中作为一种坚固的催化剂的应用潜力。
