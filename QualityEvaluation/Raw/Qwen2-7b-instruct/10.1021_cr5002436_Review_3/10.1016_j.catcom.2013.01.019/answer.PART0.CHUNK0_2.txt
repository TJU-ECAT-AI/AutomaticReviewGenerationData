The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been influenced by advancements in understanding the nature and behavior of vanadium species, particularly in relation to carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Research has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with a focus on optimizing these factors to enhance catalyst efficiency and stability. Vanadium species' characteristics are crucial in determining the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation processes. The use of different carriers, supports with varied surface areas, and precise metal loadings can significantly affect the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Studies have shown that the presence of a hard template during the synthesis of gallium oxide materials helps maintain the mesopore structure during recrystallization, contributing to higher stability and resistance to deactivation. Additionally, the incorporation of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of alkanes leads to enhanced olefin yields and reduced coke deposition through participating in specific chemical reactions, such as the reverse water-gas shift and Boudouard reactions. The catalytic properties of mesoporous oxides, like gallium oxide, have been extensively studied in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, demonstrating promising outcomes in terms of product selectivity and stability over multiple reaction cycles. The results highlight the potential of these materials in alternative dehydrogenation pathways, offering viable alternatives to traditional catalysts.
