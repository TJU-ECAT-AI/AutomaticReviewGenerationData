[1] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8."
[2] "Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."
[3] "The initial conversion of propane on the catalysts decreased in the order Ga8Al2O15 > γ -Ga2O3 > Ga5Al5O15 > Ga2Al8O15, with the same tendency observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area."
[4] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples."
[5] "For all of the catalysts, propane conversion decreased with increasing reaction time."
[6] "This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."
[7] "The participation of surface Ga3+ Lewis sites in gallia-based catalysts for hydrocarbon activation has been reported."
[8] "Remarkable stability for propane dehydrogenation was recently reported for an HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3 catalyst at 873 K, but at the expense of marked side reactions, such as propane aromatization."
[9] "It is noteworthy that even after 50 h on stream, high conversion of propane (up to 22.5%) was still maintained for Ga5Al5O15."
