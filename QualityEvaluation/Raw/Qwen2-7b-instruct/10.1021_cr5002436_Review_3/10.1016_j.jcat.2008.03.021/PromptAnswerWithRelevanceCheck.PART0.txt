[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
[2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
[3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[4] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

The research focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 using a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides. The maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8. The most notable discovery is the significantly improved stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15. The high activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides is linked to the abundance of specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems. The weak surface acidity, specifically the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface, plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and stability.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for environmentally friendly and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the nature and behavior of vanadium species through various parameters. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading have been crucial in influencing the effectiveness of vanadium-based catalysts. The aim is to achieve high activity and selectivity while maintaining stability over multiple reaction cycles.

1. Commercial gallium oxide (Ga2O3) has been found to exhibit exceptional activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2), surpassing other metal oxides like chromium (Cr2O3) and vanadium (V2O5) in certain applications.

2. Some recent studies have shown that supported gallium oxides can be more active and stable for the dehydrogenation of lighter alkanes compared to traditional catalysts, especially when aiming for chromium-free processes.

3. Chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen, as they offer an environmentally friendly alternative.

4. The current study aimed to develop a novel gallium-aluminum oxide (Ga2O3Al2O3) solid solution system that could significantly enhance the activity and stability for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.

5. The formation of a gallia-alumina solid solution between gallium oxide and aluminum oxide allows for the creation of a higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity, contributing to the catalyst's high activity and stability.

6. To the researchers' knowledge, the utilization of gallium-aluminum oxide solid solutions as catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation had not been reported prior to this study.

7. Across all gallium-containing materials tested, the selectivity towards propylene was consistently high (over 91%), while the highest conversion of propane reached 51.7%.

8. The beneficial impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) on the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples, suggesting a complex interplay between the catalyst's structure and CO2's role.

9. This unusual behavior might be attributed to a significant reduction in propane adsorption capacity when CO2 is introduced into the system, potentially affecting the catalyst's performance.

10. Achieving a higher population of low-coordinated gallium (Ga3+) sites on the surface of gallium oxide-based catalysts appears to be a viable strategy for enhancing the activity and selectivity of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

在探索以范德华氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的过程中，环保和成本效益成为主要驱动力。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，重点是通过各种参数优化范德华物种的性质和行为。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量对范德华基催化剂的有效性至关重要。

1. 商业化的镓氧化物（Ga2O3）在二氧化碳（CO2）存在的条件下表现出极高的活性，用于乙烷到乙烯的脱氢反应，其性能明显优于铬（Cr2O3）和钒（V2O5）等其他金属氧化物。

2. 一些近期的研究表明，在某些应用中，支持的镓氧化物比传统的催化剂更能高效稳定地进行轻质烷烃的脱氢反应，尤其是在追求无铬催化剂时。

3. 无铬催化剂对于在无氢的情况下进行丙烷脱氢非常有吸引力，因为它们提供了一种环境友好的替代方案。

4. 当前的研究旨在开发一种新型的镓铝氧化物（Ga2O3Al2O3）固溶体系统，该系统可以显著提高丙烷催化脱氢的活性和稳定性。

5. 镓铝氧化物固溶体的形成允许在镓氧化物和氧化铝之间产生更多的表面镓位点，具有较弱的拉曼酸性，这有助于催化剂的高活性和稳定性。

6. 到研究人员的了解，镓铝氧化物固溶体作为烷烃脱氢催化剂的应用此前尚未报道。

7. 在所有镓含材料测试中，丙烯的选择性始终很高（超过91%），而丙烷的最大转化率达到了51.7%。

8. 碳氧化物（CO2）对丙烷脱氢的促进作用在所有样品中并未观察到，这可能表明催化剂结构与CO2作用之间的复杂相互影响。

9. 这一不寻常的现象可能归因于引入CO2系统后丙烷吸附能力的显著降低，可能影响催化剂的性能。

10. 通过在镓氧化物基催化剂的表面上实现更高数量的低配位镓（Ga3+）位点，似乎是一种增强丙烷脱氢活性和选择性的可行策略。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer competitive catalytic performance while addressing environmental concerns associated with chromium usage. Since the 1980s, research in this area has focused on developing vanadium oxide catalysts with optimized properties, including carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, to enhance the nature and behavior of vanadium species. These factors influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Notably, the literature highlights the importance of achieving a higher population of low-coordinated surface gallium (Ga)3+ sites in gallium oxide-based catalysts for improving the dehydrogenation efficiency of propane. This strategy leverages the Lewis acidity of surface Ga3+ sites to facilitate the activation of hydrocarbon species, leading to more efficient and stable dehydrogenation reactions.
