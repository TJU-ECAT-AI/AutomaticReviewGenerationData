[1] "In recent years, Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes [5,1721]."
[2] "This was prompted by Nakagawas reports of exceptionally high activity of the commercial Ga2O3 for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 [20]."
[3] "Although commer- cial Ga2O3 has been shown to be far superior for the ethane de- hydrogenation reaction compared with Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts,some recent studies have demonstrated that supported gallium oxides can be more active and stable for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [5,2123]."
[4] "For all of the Ga-containing materials, the selec- tivity to propylene was always high (>91%), whereas the highest conversion of propane was 51.7%."
[5] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples."
[6] "In this respect, it appears that more active cata- lysts for propane dehydrogenation can be obtained by achieving a higher population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3-based catalysts."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer competitive catalytic performance while addressing environmental concerns associated with chromium usage. Since the 1980s, research in this area has focused on developing vanadium oxide catalysts with optimized properties, including carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, to enhance the nature and behavior of vanadium species. These factors influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Notably, the literature highlights the importance of achieving a higher population of low-coordinated surface gallium (Ga)3+ sites in gallium oxide-based catalysts for improving the dehydrogenation efficiency of propane. This strategy leverages the Lewis acidity of surface Ga3+ sites to facilitate the activation of hydrocarbon species, leading to more efficient and stable dehydrogenation reactions.

近年来，镓氧化物催化剂作为烷烃脱氢过程潜在候选者的兴趣日益增长，这主要是由于它们有可能提供与铬基催化剂相当但环境友好的催化性能。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究重点是开发具有优化特性的钨氧化物催化剂，包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载，以增强钨物种的性质。这些因素影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。文献强调通过在镓氧化物基催化剂中实现低配位表面镓（Ga）3+位点的更高密度来提高丙烷脱氢效率的重要性。这一策略利用表面Ga3+位点的Lewis酸性来促进烃类物种的活化，从而实现更高效的稳定脱氢反应。
