[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
[2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
[3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[4] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

The research focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 using a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides. The maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8. The most notable discovery is the significantly improved stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15. The high activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides is linked to the abundance of specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems. The weak surface acidity, specifically the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface, plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and stability.

研究重点是使用一系列GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物对丙烷进行催化脱氢，在有或无CO2的情况下。在x=8时，观察到最大初始活性和丙烯产率。最显著的发现是在高转化水平下，Ga5Al5O15的稳定性显著提高。GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的高活性与形成Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体系统中表面Ga3+位点相关的大量特定表面酸性位点有关。表面弱酸性，特别是表面弱路易斯酸位点的密度，对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。
