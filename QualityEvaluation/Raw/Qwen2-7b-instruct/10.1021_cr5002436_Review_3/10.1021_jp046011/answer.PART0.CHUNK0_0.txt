[1] "Supported vanadia catalysts have attracted significant interest in recent decades due to their good catalytic performance in many redox reactions such as dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, and selective reduction of NOx."
[2] "Three kinds of bonds between vanadium and oxygen are present in these VOx species: VO, VOV, and VOS (S, support). It is generally accepted that the bridging VOS bond is critical for redox reactions catalyzed by supported VOx."
[3] "The broad Raman band at around 910 cm-1, observed on dehydrated V/δ-, γ-Al2O3 at all V loadings (0.0114.2 V/nm2), is assigned to the interface mode (VOAl) instead of the conventionally assigned VOV bond."
[4] "Two types of frequency shifts of the VO stretching band (10131035 cm-1) have been observed in the Raman spectra of V/Al2O3: a shift as a function of surface VOx density and a shift as a function of excitation wavelength."
[5] "It is notable that most Raman studies of supported VOx catalysts were carried out using a single excitation wavelength in the visible region (either 514 or 532 nm)."
[6] "Excitation of Raman spectra within the absorption region will produce resonance-enhanced spectra from the subset of VOx species with absorptions at the excitation wavelength."
[7] "Through measurement of the Raman spectra at several wavelengths, more information can be obtained about the various VOx species in the distribution."
[8] "The reason lies in the strong electronic absorptions in the UV and visible wavelength regions exhibited by most transition-metal oxides which make it possible to measure resonance-enhanced Raman spectra."
[9] "By comparison with those of model vanadium compounds,32 UVvis absorption bands at around 240 and 290 nm were assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated monovanadate."
[10] "For example, in Figure 6A, the peak maximum at 903 K for 0.16 V shifts to 802 K for 1.2 V, to 784 K for 4.4 V, back to 803 K for 8 V, and to 818 K with a split at 868 K for 14.2 V."
[11] "The high-temperature peak at ca. 873903 K is mainly due to isolated adsorbed vanadia species that bind strongly to the alumina support, presumably via three VOAl bonds."
[12] "The similarity of the TPR profiles of vanadia on δ- and γ-Al2O3 shows that the support phase (environment) has little effect on the reducibility of the three surface VOx species."
