[1] "Supported vanadia catalysts have attracted significant interest in recent decades due to their good catalytic performance in many redox reactions 1-6 such as dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, and selective reduction of NOx."
[2] "A better understanding of the catalytic properties of supported vanadium oxides requires determination of the structurereactivity relationships of the supported VOx catalysts."
[3] "Three kinds of bonds between vanadium and oxygen are present in these VOx species: VO, VOV, and VOS (S, support)."
[4] "It is generally accepted that the bridging VOS bond is critical for redox reactions catalyzed by supported VOx."
[5] "Most Raman studies of supported VOx catalysts were carried out using a single excitation wavelength in the visible region (either 514 or 532 nm)."
[6] "Several recent investigations on supported transition-metal oxides, including vanadium oxides under ambient conditions, using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths."
[7] "By comparison with those of model vanadium compounds, the bands at 270, 340, and 412 nm have been ascribed to polyvanadate in either tetrahedral or pentahedral coordination."
[8] "For example, in Figure 6A, the peak maximum at 903 K for 0.16 V shifts to 802 K for 1.2 V, to 784 K for 4.4 V, back to 803 K for 8 V, and to 818 K with a split at 868 K for 14.2 V."
[9] "The broad Raman band at ca. 910 cm-1, previously assigned to VOV vibrations in polyvanadates, is observed on V/Al2O3 with surface densities as low as 0.01 V/nm2 and is assigned to the interface mode (VOAl)."
[10] "Because of the resonance enhancement effect and the avoidance of fluorescence in UV Raman spectroscopy, UV Raman can provide structural information on VOx species at extremely low surface VOx density (down to 0.01 V/nm2), where the VOx is not detectable by visible Raman."

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have gained attention for their effectiveness in redox reactions like dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxidation of methanol, ammoxidation, and selective reduction of NOx. Research in this field has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and reactivity.

2. The catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxides is influenced by the type of carrier material, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species within the catalyst.

3. Vanadium-oxygen bonds present in vanadium oxide species include VO, VOV, and VOS. The VOS bond is considered crucial for redox reactions catalyzed by supported VOx catalysts.

4. Most Raman spectroscopy studies of supported VOx catalysts have traditionally used a single visible wavelength for excitation. However, recent investigations suggest that utilizing both UV and visible wavelengths could provide more comprehensive structural information.

5. The electronic absorption properties of vanadium oxides in the UV and visible regions allow for resonance-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, which can reveal details about supported metal oxides that might not be accessible through conventional methods.

6. The shift in the reduction peak maximum for different surface VOx densities indicates how the structure and composition of supported VOx catalysts change with varying metal loading.

7. The interface mode (VOAl) between vanadium and alumina is observed in Raman spectroscopy at low surface densities, offering insight into the active site for redox reactions.

8. UV Raman spectroscopy enables the detection of vanadium oxide species at very low surface densities, where visible Raman might fail to provide sufficient information due to limitations in signal strength and interference from fluorescence.
