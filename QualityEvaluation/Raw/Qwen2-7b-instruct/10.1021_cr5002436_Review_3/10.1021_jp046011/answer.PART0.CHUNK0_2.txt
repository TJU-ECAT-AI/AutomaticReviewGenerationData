[1] "Supported vanadia catalysts have attracted significant interest in recent decades due to their good catalytic performance in many redox reactions such as dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, and selective reduction of NOx."
[2] "A better understanding of the catalytic properties of supported vanadium oxides requires determination of the structurereactivity relationships of the supported VOx catalysts."
[3] "Three kinds of bonds between vanadium and oxygen are present in these VOx species: VO, VOV, and VOS (S, support)."
[4] "The presence of these species is a function of VOx loading, the nature of the support, and the ambient environment."
[5] "It is generally accepted that the bridging VOS bond is critical for redox reactions catalyzed by supported VOx."
[6] "It is notable that most Raman studies of supported VOx catalysts were carried out using a single excitation wavelength in the visible region (either 514 or 532 nm)."
[7] "However, several recent investigations on supported transition-metal oxides, including vanadium oxides under ambient conditions, using both UV and visible wavelength Raman excitations suggest that more complete and sometimes new structural information of supported metal oxides can be achieved by using multiple excitation wavelengths."
[8] "The reason lies in the strong electronic absorptions in the UV and visible wavelength regions exhibited by most transition-metal oxides which make it possible to measure resonance-enhanced Raman spectra."
[9] "Through measurement of the Raman spectra at several wavelengths, more information can be obtained about the various VOx species in the distribution."
[10] "Moreover, when UV excitation is employed, even Raman spectra from supported VOx at low loadings (<1wt %) on oxides having strong fluorescence are possible because of the avoidance of fluorescence and enhanced sensitivity."
[11] "The present work is aimed at a further study of the structure of VOx supported on alumina using both UV (244 nm) and visible (488 nm) excited Raman spectroscopy and especially the structure of supported VOx at extremely low surface density (down to 0.01 V/nm2)."

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have gained significant interest due to their effectiveness in redox reactions like dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, ammoxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, and selective reduction of NOx. Research in this field has evolved significantly over the past decades, focusing on understanding the structure-reactivity relationships of supported vanadium oxides.

2. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading. These factors determine the structure of vanadium oxide species present on the catalyst surface.

3. Vanadium oxides contain three types of bonds between vanadium and oxygen: VO, VOV, and VOS (where S represents the support).

4. The composition of vanadium oxide species is contingent upon the amount of vanadium oxide (loading), the characteristics of the support material, and the environmental conditions.

5. The bridging VOS bond is considered crucial for redox reactions catalyzed by supported vanadium oxides.

6. Most Raman spectroscopy studies of supported vanadium oxides utilized a single excitation wavelength in the visible region.

7. Recent investigations on supported transition-metal oxides, including vanadium oxides, using both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light excitations have shown that employing multiple wavelengths can provide more comprehensive structural information about supported metal oxides.
