[1] "Supported vanadia catalysts have attracted significant interest in recent decades due to their good catalytic performance in many redox reactions."
[2] "It is our intention to use these supported VOx materials as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, and with this in mind, the suitability of various alumina phases was considered."
[3] "Since the dehydrogenation reaction operates near the temperature for phase transition from γ-Al2O3 to δ-Al2O3, 23,24 the δ-alumina phase is expected to be more stable for dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Raman spectra of dehydrated V/δ-Al2O3 samples are presented in Figure 1A, which also includes the spectra of δ-Al2O3 and V2O5 for comparison."
[5] "The Raman band at ca. 1023 cm-1 can be assigned to the VO stretching mode of surface VOx species."
[6] "It is striking to note that some Raman features due to surface VOx species can be distinguished for V/δ-Al2O3 samples at extremely low surface density even down to 0.01 V/nm2."
[7] "The UVvis spectra in Figure 5A imply that tetrahedral VOx species are present on the support surface at surface densities below 1.2 V/nm2 while pentahedral VOx and V2O5 are the main species at surface densities above 1.2 V/nm2."
[8] "The high-temperature peak at ca. 873903 K is mainly due to isolated adsorbed vanadia species that bind strongly to the alumina support, presumably via three VOAl bonds."
[9] "The broad Raman band at ca. 910 cm-1, previously assigned to VOV vibrations in polyvanadates, is observed on V/Al2O3 with surface densities as low as 0.01 V/nm2 and is assigned to the interface mode (VOAl)."
[10] "Because of the resonance enhancement effect and the avoidance of fluorescence in UV Raman spectroscopy, UV Raman can provide structural information on VOx species at extremely low surface VOx density (down to 0.01 V/nm2), where the VOx is not detectable by visible Raman."
[11] "The present study suggests that a complete structural characterization of supported metal oxide catalysts requires a multiwavelength excitation approach in Raman spectroscopy."

1. The interest in vanadium oxide-based catalysts has grown significantly in recent decades due to their effectiveness in various redox reactions, making them a potential alternative to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. Research in this field has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the development of catalysts with improved activity and selectivity.

2. The choice of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading plays a crucial role in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Different carriers can alter the dispersion of vanadium oxides, influencing their reactivity and stability.

3. The study of vanadium oxide catalysts on aluminas aims to optimize their performance for alkane dehydrogenation. Considering the stability requirements for dehydrogenation reactions, δ-alumina is preferred over γ-alumina due to its higher stability at the temperatures involved.

4. The Raman spectra analysis helps distinguish between various types of vanadium oxide species on the surface of aluminas. The spectra reveal the presence of isolated vanadia, polymerized vanadia, and crystalline V2O5, depending on the loading and support.

5. The VO stretching mode band observed in the Raman spectra is indicative of the vanadium-oxygen bonds in the vanadium oxide species. The band at around 1023 cm-1 specifically corresponds to the vibration of the vanadium-oxygen bond in the surface species.

6. Even at extremely low surface densities (down to 0.01 V/nm2), Raman spectroscopy can identify specific features of vanadium oxide species on the alumina surface, which might not be detectable using visible Raman spectroscopy.

7. The UVvis spectra provide insights into the coordination structure of vanadium oxide species on the support. Below a surface density of 1.2 V/nm2, tetrahedral coordination is predominant, whereas higher densities indicate the presence of pentahedral coordination and crystalline V2O5.

8. The TPR (Temperature Programmed Reduction) profiles of vanadium oxide catalysts on aluminas indicate the distribution and reducibility of surface species. The peaks at lower temperatures correspond to isolated adsorbed vanadia, while higher temperature peaks are associated with clustered vanadia species and well-dispersed V2O5.

9. The Raman band at around 910 cm-1, originally assigned to VOV vibrations in polyvanadates, has been reinterpreted as an interface mode (VOAl) between vanadium and alumina. This finding is significant for understanding redox reactions catalyzed by supported vanadium oxides.

10. The use of UV Raman spectroscopy allows for the detection of vanadium oxide species at very low surface densities (down to 0.01 V/nm2), which enhances the sensitivity to isolated and less polymerized species compared to visible Raman spectroscopy.

11. The study concludes that a comprehensive structural characterization of supported metal oxide catalysts necessitates the use of multiwavelength excitation approaches in Raman spectroscopy, providing a more complete understanding of the catalyst's structure and behavior.

1. 在过去几十年中，对含钒氧化物催化剂的兴趣显著增加，它们在许多氧化还原反应中的性能良好，这使其成为烷烃脱氢等应用的潜在替代品，例如铂和铬氧化物催化剂。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究不断发展，重点是开发具有更好活性和选择性的催化剂。
