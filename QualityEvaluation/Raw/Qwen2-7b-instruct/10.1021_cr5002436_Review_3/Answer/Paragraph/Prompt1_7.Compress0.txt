{"Quotes": "\"[1] For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst systems.\n          [2] However, several drawbacks are associated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.\n          [3] The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.\n          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins.\n          [5] In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions.\n          [6] Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.\n          [7] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.\n          [8] The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst.\"", "English": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. The development of silicon carbide (SiC) materials has shown promise in various applications, including catalytic processes due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and good mechanical strength. These properties, combined with their ability to be prepared with high surface area, make SiC a suitable candidate for use as a catalyst support.\n\n          Research has indicated that molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. This is advantageous compared to chromium oxide catalysts, which deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, often leaving carcinogenic Cr6+ ions after regeneration. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.\n\n          The active phase in dehydrogenation consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is crucial for the formation of this active phase. This phase likely comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity observed in this catalyst system. The surface area of the support, metal loading, and carrier type influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the current performance of the system is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium under the tested conditions. Further improvements are needed for it to be ready for industrial use.\n\n          Earlier studies showed that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane but is unstable under the required reaction conditions. In contrast, molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation.

The presence of both hydrogen and steam is necessary for the formation of this active phase, which likely consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is located on the catalyst's uppermost layer.

Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.\n          [3] The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.\n          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins.\n          [5] In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions.\n          [6] Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.\n          [7] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.\n          [8] The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst.\"", "English": "The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. The development of silicon carbide (SiC) materials has shown promise in various applications, including catalytic processes due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and good mechanical strength. These properties, combined with their ability to be prepared with high surface area, make SiC a suitable candidate for use as a catalyst support.\n\n          Research has indicated that molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. This is advantageous compared to chromium oxide catalysts, which deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, often leaving carcinogenic Cr6+ ions after regeneration. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.\n\n          The active phase in dehydrogenation consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is crucial for the formation of this active phase. This phase likely comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity observed in this catalyst system. The surface area of the support, metal loading, and carrier type influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the current performance of the system is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium under the tested conditions. Further improvements are needed for it to be ready for industrial use.\n\n          Earlier studies showed that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane but is unstable under the required reaction conditions. In contrast, molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation. The active phase involves molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is necessary for the formation of this active phase, which likely consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is located on the catalyst's uppermost layer. The active phase on the silica-supported catalyst might contain more carbon (carbide-like phase), resulting in a non-selective catalyst.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00190-8"},

Variables such as the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Alumina is commonly used as a support due to its high surface area and stability. The surface area of the support affects the dispersion of vanadium oxide particles, influencing the availability of active sites. Metal loading refers to the amount of vanadium relative to the support, impacting the redox properties and the ability of the catalyst to undergo various transformations. Metal promoters like magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) can alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, affecting its activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.\n\n          The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without magnesium and zirconium was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure.
