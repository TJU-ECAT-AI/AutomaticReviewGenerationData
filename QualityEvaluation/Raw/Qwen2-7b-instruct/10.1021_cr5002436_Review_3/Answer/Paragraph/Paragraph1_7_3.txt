The development of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the pursuit of sustainable and economically viable catalytic systems. Research since the 1980s has significantly advanced our understanding of structure-reactivity relationships, with a focus on enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are intricately linked to factors including the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading. Gallium oxides, for instance, have demonstrated remarkable activity in alkane dehydroaromatization, and their recent resurgence highlights the exceptional promotion effect in carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol. Surface area critically impacts catalytic activity, often aligning closely with maximum activity levels, and is notably insensitive to changes in particle size within specified ranges, underscoring the importance of impregnated area over physical structure.

            The dynamic role of gallium in alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts, transforming from Ga+3 species to a highly dispersed, monomeric hydride form coordinated to oxygen, has been elucidated. This hydride species releases hydrogen under high surface hydrogen fugacity, active only at reaction conditions, and upon cooling, reoxidizes to Ga+3, indicating its existence solely under operational conditions. This reversible transformation underscores the catalyst's dynamic nature.

            In the realm of paraffin dehydrogenation, vanadium oxide catalysts have emerged as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide, offering significant advantages in terms of sustainability and cost-effectiveness. Research has underscored the pivotal role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the properties and performance of vanadium species. Early studies have shown that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity but instability, whereas molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide (SiC) is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation, indicating the potential for further industrial application.

            The integration of promoting elements and optimized support systems leads to highly active and selective catalysts, exemplified by PtSn/Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for dehydrogenating ethane and propane respectively. The activity measurements conducted at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor highlight the effectiveness of these catalysts, with the products analyzed online using techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and gas chromatography (GC).

            The incorporation of zinc cations into zeolite catalysts significantly enhances alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization processes, increasing turnover rates and aromatic site-time yields. This modification also boosts the rate of hydrogen recombination desorption, affecting alkene conversion. Notably, the presence of zinc cations leads to an elevated ratio of propene aromatization to hydrogenation compared to conventional catalysts, supporting the catalyst's ability to reduce β-scission rates, leading to a higher synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products.

            The efficiency of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation is significantly influenced by the bulk In/Pt ratio, achieving maximum activity at 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. Alloying In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, with carbon primarily depositing on the support in ethane dehydrogenation and partly on PtIn nanoparticles in propane dehydrogenation. This alloying also minimally decreases coke deposition, enhancing catalyst longevity and performance.

            The patent data and literature reports have shown that pentasil-type zeolites are attractive acid catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes into aromatics. While it was established that the major role of Pt was to enhance the production of propene from propane, the role of gallium appeared less satisfactorily interpreted. On Ga20s, the major reaction of propane was the dehydrogenation into propene. GaO, is not active in the polymerization of olefins, but it catalyzes cyclization of C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons and does not promote hydrogen-transfer reactions between olefins and cycloparaffins, a reaction catalyzed by solid acids. With l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene, and probably with other paraffins, aromatic hydrocarbons are formed via dehydrogenation of the paraffin to generate dienes and trienes.

            The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have thus evolved significantly since the 1980s, with ongoing research focusing on the optimization of carrier materials, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance catalyst properties and performance. Future directions might involve exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to further advance the field of petrochemical processing.
