The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have seen significant advancements since the 1980s, focusing on factors like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Gallium oxides, for instance, were noted for their activity in alkane dehydroaromatization around two decades ago and their recent resurgence highlights their exceptional promotion in carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol, showcasing the versatility and evolving nature of these catalysts in petrochemical processing.

            Vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation have evolved, driven by the need for sustainable and economically viable catalytic systems. Research since the 1980s has advanced, focusing on understanding structure-reactivity relationships and enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Surface area critically impacts catalytic activity, aligning closely with maximum activity levels. Activity is notably insensitive to particle size changes within specified ranges, underscoring the importance of impregnated area over physical structure.

            The chemical state of gallium in working alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts was explored, revealing that gallium species initially present as Ga+3 transform during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions, reducing to a highly dispersed, monomeric hydride form coordinated to oxygen. This hydride species releases hydrogen under high surface hydrogen fugacity, active only at reaction conditions, demonstrating the dynamic role of gallium in these catalysts. Upon cooling, the reduced gallium reoxidizes to Ga+3, indicating its existence solely under operational conditions.

            In another study, it was found that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity but instability under required reaction conditions. In contrast, molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide (SiC) was identified as an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane, offering a significant improvement over chromium oxide catalysts that deactivate rapidly and leave carcinogenic Cr6+ ions post-regeneration. Platinum catalysts, needing additives and being sensitive to feed impurities, are less favorable compared to the molybdenum oxide supported on SiC system.

            Since the 1980s, research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has emphasized the optimization of carrier materials, support surface area, and metal loading to influence vanadium species' behavior. Key findings include the highest activity after CO reduction, increased i-butene selectivity with magnesium (Mg), and the formation of V3+ and V4+ species with different coordinations. These species' activity varies, with V4+ (A) considered higher than V3+. The presence of promoters like Mg and Zr alters catalyst properties, impacting activity and selectivity.

            The text highlights the evolution of catalyst development in response to the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation. The incorporation of zinc cations into zeolite catalysts significantly enhances alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization processes, increasing turnover rates and aromatic site-time yields. This modification also boosts the rate of hydrogen recombination desorption, affecting alkene conversion. Notably, the presence of zinc cations leads to an elevated ratio of propene aromatization to hydrogenation compared to conventional catalysts.

            The efficiency of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation is significantly influenced by the bulk In/Pt ratio, peaking at 0.48, which results in a PtIn alloy with 12% In. Alloying indium (In) with platinum (Pt) causes a substantial decrease in the accumulation of carbon during both reactions, with carbon primarily depositing on the support in ethane dehydrogenation and partly on PtIn nanoparticles in propane dehydrogenation. This alloying also minimally decreases coke deposition, a common issue post-catalyst use, thereby enhancing catalyst longevity and performance.

            The role of gallium in catalytic processes was less satisfactorily interpreted, particularly in the context of its activity in alkane dehydroaromatization and its non-promotion of hydrogen-transfer reactions between olefins and cycloparaffins. With hexene and hexadiene, and likely other paraffins, aromatic hydrocarbons are formed via dehydrogenation of the paraffin to generate dienes and trienes.

            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the synergistic effects of multiple metal oxides, the optimization of carrier materials for enhanced stability and activity, and the development of catalysts with improved selectivity towards desired products, potentially addressing the limitations in alkane aromatization and hydrogen transfer reactions catalyzed by solid acids. There is also a need to investigate the potential of gallium-based catalysts in tandem with other metals or in novel combinations to enhance their activity and selectivity in paraffin dehydrogenation and related processes.

            基于\[10.1016/s0926-860x(03)00488-5\]的深度分析。从\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]和\[\[10.1021/jp807864z\]\]的综合理解。自1980年代以来，vanadium氧化物基催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品的发展和表征经历了显著的进步，重点在于载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等参数，以影响vanadium物种的性质和行为。例如，大约20年前，ga离子在烷烃脱氢芳构化中的活性受到关注，并且最近对其的重新关注表明了其在二氧化碳氢化为甲醇中的非凡促进作用，这体现了这些催化剂在石油化工加工中的多功能性和不断演变的特性。

            自1980年代以来，对于paraffin脱氢用vanadium氧化物催化剂的发展，主要由可持续性和经济性的需求驱动。研究已经取得了进展，专注于理解结构反应性关系并增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。表面面积对催化活性的影响极为关键，与最大活性水平紧密相关。活性在特定范围内颗粒尺寸变化时保持相对不敏感，强调了浸渍面积的重要性，而不是物理结构。

            对于工作烷基脱氢环二聚化催化剂中ga的状态进行了深入探索，结果表明ga物种最初以Ga+3的形式存在，在氢处理或丙烷反应期间降低到高度分散、单核的氢化形式，与氧配位。这种氢化物种在高表面氢分压下释放氢气，仅在反应条件下有效，展示了ga在这些催化剂中的动态作用。冷却后，还原的ga重新氧化为Ga+3，表明其仅在操作条件下存在。

            在另一项研究中，发现未支持的molybdenum trioxide（MoO3）与碳修饰表现出高初始活性但不稳定，不符合所需反应条件。相比之下，molybdenum oxide支持在硅碳（SiC）上被确定为n-丁烷脱氢的活性和稳定的催化剂，相对于快速失活并留下致癌Cr6+离子的铬氧化物催化剂提供了显著改进。铂催化剂需要添加剂，并且对原料杂质（如水分和氧化合物）敏感，与molybdenum oxide支持在SiC系统相比，后者更优。

            从1980年代开始，关于vanadium氧化物基催化剂用于paraffin脱氢的研究强调了优化载体材料、支持表面面积和金属负载以影响vanadium物种行为的重要性。关键发现包括在CO处理后达到最高活性，通过镁（Mg）增加i-butene的选择性，并形成V3+和V4+物种，具有不同的配位。这些物种的活性不同，其中V4+（A）被认为比V3+更高。促进剂如Mg和Zr改变了催化剂的属性，影响了活性和选择性。

            文本强调了响应寻找替代铂和铬氧化物催化剂的paraffin脱氢过程的需求而发展的催化剂开发。锌离子的引入到沸石催化剂中显著增强了烷基脱氢和芳香化过程，提高了周转率和芳香位时间产率。这种修改还增强了氢再组合脱附的速率，影响了烯烃的转换。值得注意的是，锌离子导致丙烷转化为丙烯的比例增加，相比传统催化剂而言，这增加了丙烷转化为芳香烃的效率。

            对于Pt/Mg(In)(Al)催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢中的效率受批量In/Pt比率的影响显著，峰值出现在0.48，产生含12% In的PtIn合金。将铟（In）与铂（Pt）合金化引起碳积累的显著减少，在乙烷脱氢过程中主要沉积在支撑物上，在丙烷脱氢过程中，部分碳也沉积在PtIn纳米颗粒上。这种合金化也轻微减少了焦炭沉积，这是催化剂使用后的常见问题，从而提高了催化剂的寿命和性能。

            关于ga在催化过程中的作用的解释不太令人满意，尤其是在其在烷基脱氢芳构化中的活性和非促进氢转移反应之间的相互作用。对于己烯和己二烯以及可能的其他烷基，通过烷基脱氢生成二烯和三烯来形成芳香烃。

            整合的理解和前瞻性的展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，有潜力探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来的研究努力可能会集中在多个金属氧化物协同效应、优化载体材料以提高稳定性和活性，以及开发具有更好目标产物选择性的催化剂上，有可能解决固体酸催化下的烷基芳构化和氢转移反应的局限性。还需要调查ga基催化剂与其他金属或新型组合的潜力，以增强它们在paraffin脱氢及相关过程中的活性和选择性。
