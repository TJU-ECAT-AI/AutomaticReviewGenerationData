        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/s0926-860x(03)00488-5\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ie50442a027\] and \[10.1021/jp807864z\]. The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have significantly evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the structure-reactivity relationships of vanadium oxides and the influence of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species behavior. Gallium oxides' activity in alkane dehydroaromatization was noted circa 20 years ago, and their recent resurgence highlights their exceptional promotion in carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol. These catalysts' properties, particularly those of gallium oxides, have significantly improved, offering promising alternatives in petrochemical processing. 

        The catalytic properties of gallium and gallium oxides supported on aluminosilicates have received attention some 20 years ago owing to their activity in alkane dehydroaromatisation \[10.1016/s0926-860x(03)00488-5\]. Interest for gallium oxides has been renewed recently on account of their remarkable promoting influence for carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol \[10.1021/ie50442a027\]. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation have emerged as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide since the 1980s, emphasizing factors like carrier type, surface area, and metal loading. Surface area critically impacts catalytic activity, aligning closely with maximum activity levels. Activity is notably insensitive to particle size changes within specified ranges, underscoring the importance of impregnated area over physical structure \[10.1021/jp807864z\].

        Exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more sustainable and economically viable catalytic systems \[10.1021/jp807864z\]. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the structure-reactivity relationships of vanadium oxides \[10.1021/ie50442a027\]. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors including the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading \[10.1021/jp807864z\].

        The development of a simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials provided a basis for correlating information on the action of adsorbents in this application \[10.1021/ie50442a027\]. Activated aluminas were impregnated with varying quantities of molybdenum and their catalytic activities determined for dehydrocyclization of n-heptane to toluene at atmospheric pressure \[10.1021/ie50442a027\]. Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained \[10.1021/ie50442a027\]. Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity \[10.1021/ie50442a027\]. Compari-son of the calculated molybdenum area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdenum at maximum activity \[10.1021/ie50442a027\]. Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh \[10.1021/ie50442a027\].

        The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst \[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00190-8\]. The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst \[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00190-8\]. Early studies showed that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity but instability, whereas molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation, indicating the potential for further industrial application \[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00190-8\].

        The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without Mg and Zr was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580C under atmospheric pressure \[10.1006/jcat.2001.3329\]. The catalyst activity was evaluated, after reduction with H2 and CO, as a function of the amount of the promotor \[10.1006/jcat.2001.3329\]. The dehydro- genation activity was highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased and the formation of coke decreased with the addition of Mg \[10.1006/jcat.2001.3329\]. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, during CO reduction, V3+ species and two kinds of V4+ species with different coordinations (A and B) were formed on the catalyst surface \[10.1006/jcat.2001.3329\].

        The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008\]. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008\]. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008\]. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles \[10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008\].

        Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization \[10.1006/jcat.1998.2312\]. The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1) \[10.1006/jcat.1998.2312\]. Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates \[10.1006/jcat.1998.2312\].

        The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have seen significant advancements since the 1980s, driven by the quest for sustainable and cost-effective catalytic solutions. Research efforts have concentrated on understanding the intricate structure-reactivity relationships of vanadium oxides, optimizing carrier types, support surface areas, and metal loadings to enhance vanadium species' behavior. These catalysts offer a viable alternative to precious metal catalysts like platinum and chromium oxide, presenting an avenue for more environmentally friendly and economically feasible petrochemical processing.

Additionally, the development of in-situ monitoring tools for real-time characterization of catalyst performance could provide deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of vanadium species under operational conditions, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable petrochemical processing technologies.

        铝硅酸盐上的镓和镓氧化物的催化性能在大约20年前引起了人们的关注，因为它们在烷烃芳香化中的活性而受到关注；最近，人们对镓氧化物的兴趣被重新点燃，这是由于它们在二氧化碳氢化为甲醇中的显著促进作用。自20世纪80年代以来，范德华氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢的替代品的发展已经取得了显著进展，强调了载体类型、表面面积和金属负载对范德华物种行为的影响。表面面积对于催化活性至关重要，与最大活性水平紧密相关。活性对特定范围内的颗粒大小变化相对不敏感，突出了浸渍面积的重要性，而非物理结构\[10.1021/jp807864z\]。

        探索范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品在烷烃脱氢中的应用，旨在提供更可持续和经济有效的催化系统的需求。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，重点关注范德华氧化物的结构反应性关系的理解\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]。范德华物种在这些催化剂中的性质受多种因素影响，包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载\[10.1021/jp807864z\]。

        表面测量简单方法的基础为吸附剂在本应用中的作用提供了联系信息\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]。在不同量的钼被浸渍的活化铝上确定了其在大气压力下将庚烷脱氢为苯酚的催化活性\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]。活性几乎线性地增加，直到达到依赖于铝面积的浓度为止\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]。进一步增加面积产生的活动增加速度远低于活性增加速度\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]。比较计算的钼面积与实验值的最大活性显示，最大活性时铝表面覆盖一层钼\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]。活性对从2到20网孔尺寸的变化相对不敏感\[10.1021/ie50442a027\]。

        形成的活性相需要氢和蒸汽的存在，可能由碳修饰的钼氧化物组成，并限于催化剂的顶层\[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00190-8\]。在硅酸盐支持的催化剂中形成的活性相可能包含更多碳（类似碳化物相），导致非选择性催化剂\[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00190-8\]。早期研究表明，未支持的钼氧化三氧化物（MoO3）与碳修饰后可以显示出高初始活性，但稳定性较差，而钼氧化物支持在SiC上被认为是n-丁烷脱氢的有效稳定催化剂，表明进一步工业应用的潜力\[10.1016/s0926-860x(99)00190-8\]。

        硅酸盐改性的五硅酸盐中交换锌离子增加了乙烷、丙烷和丙烯芳构化的转化率、位点时间产率和氢气消耗速率\[10.1006/jcat.1998.2312\]。丙烯芳构化（r2）与丙烯氢化（r1）速率比率在含锌样品中高于H-ZSM5，尽管锌离子增加了脱氢氢化步骤（r1，r1）的速率\[10.1006/jcat.1998.2312\]。锌离子不仅催化烷烃脱氢（r1），还催化烯烃转换速率\[10.1006/jcat.1998.2312\]。

        自20世纪80年代以来，范德华氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢的替代品的发展取得了显著进展，旨在满足可持续性和成本效益的需求。研究重点集中在理解范德华氧化物的结构反应性关系，优化载体类型、支撑表面面积和金属负载，以增强范德华物种的行为。这些催化剂为铂和铬氧化物等贵金属催化剂提供了可行的替代方案，提供了更具环境友好性和经济可行性的石油化工处理途径。
