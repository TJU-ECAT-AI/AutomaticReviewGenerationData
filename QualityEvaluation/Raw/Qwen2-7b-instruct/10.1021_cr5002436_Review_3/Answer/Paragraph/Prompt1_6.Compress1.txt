Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.\n          [3] The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.\n          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins.\n          [5] In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions.\n          [6] Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.\n          [7] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.\n          [8] The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst.\"", "English": "Vanadium oxide-based catalysts emerged as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation in the 1980s, driven by the search for more stable and less toxic catalysts.

Unlike chromium oxide, which deactivates rapidly and leaves carcinogenic Cr6+ ions post-regeneration, and platinum, sensitive to feed impurities, molybdenum oxide supported on SiC exhibited high initial activity and stability. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is essential for the formation of the active molybdenum oxide-modified carbon phase, which is confined to the catalyst's uppermost layer.
