The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have seen significant advancements since the 1980s, focusing on factors like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Gallium oxides, for instance, were noted for their activity in alkane dehydroaromatization around two decades ago and their recent resurgence highlights their exceptional promotion in carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol, showcasing the versatility and evolving nature of these catalysts in petrochemical processing.

            Vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation have evolved, driven by the need for sustainable and economically viable catalytic systems. Research since the 1980s has advanced, focusing on understanding structure-reactivity relationships and enhancing catalyst stability and activity. Surface area critically impacts catalytic activity, aligning closely with maximum activity levels. Activity is notably insensitive to particle size changes within specified ranges, underscoring the importance of impregnated area over physical structure.

            The chemical state of gallium in working alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts was explored, revealing that gallium species initially present as Ga+3 transform during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions, reducing to a highly dispersed, monomeric hydride form coordinated to oxygen. This hydride species releases hydrogen under high surface hydrogen fugacity, active only at reaction conditions, demonstrating the dynamic role of gallium in these catalysts. Upon cooling, the reduced gallium reoxidizes to Ga+3, indicating its existence solely under operational conditions.

            In another study, it was found that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity but instability under required reaction conditions. In contrast, molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide (SiC) was identified as an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane, offering a significant improvement over chromium oxide catalysts that deactivate rapidly and leave carcinogenic Cr6+ ions post-regeneration. Platinum catalysts, needing additives and being sensitive to feed impurities, are less favorable compared to the molybdenum oxide supported on SiC system.

            Since the 1980s, research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has emphasized the optimization of carrier materials, support surface area, and metal loading to influence vanadium species' behavior. Key findings include the highest activity after CO reduction, increased i-butene selectivity with magnesium (Mg), and the formation of V3+ and V4+ species with different coordinations. These species' activity varies, with V4+ (A) considered higher than V3+. The presence of promoters like Mg and Zr alters catalyst properties, impacting activity and selectivity.

            The text highlights the evolution of catalyst development in response to the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation. The incorporation of zinc cations into zeolite catalysts significantly enhances alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization processes, increasing turnover rates and aromatic site-time yields. This modification also boosts the rate of hydrogen recombination desorption, affecting alkene conversion. Notably, the presence of zinc cations leads to an elevated ratio of propene aromatization to hydrogenation compared to conventional catalysts.

            The efficiency of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation is significantly influenced by the bulk In/Pt ratio, peaking at 0.48, which results in a PtIn alloy with 12% In. Alloying indium (In) with platinum (Pt) causes a substantial decrease in the accumulation of carbon during both reactions, with carbon primarily depositing on the support in ethane dehydrogenation and partly on PtIn nanoparticles in propane dehydrogenation. This alloying also minimally decreases coke deposition, a common issue post-catalyst use, thereby enhancing catalyst longevity and performance.

            The role of gallium in catalytic processes was less satisfactorily interpreted, particularly in the context of its activity in alkane dehydroaromatization and its non-promotion of hydrogen-transfer reactions between olefins and cycloparaffins. With hexene and hexadiene, and likely other paraffins, aromatic hydrocarbons are formed via dehydrogenation of the paraffin to generate dienes and trienes.

            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the synergistic effects of multiple metal oxides, the optimization of carrier materials for enhanced stability and activity, and the development of catalysts with improved selectivity towards desired products, potentially addressing the limitations in alkane aromatization and hydrogen transfer reactions catalyzed by solid acids. There is also a need to investigate the potential of gallium-based catalysts in tandem with other metals or in novel combinations to enhance their activity and selectivity in paraffin dehydrogenation and related processes.
