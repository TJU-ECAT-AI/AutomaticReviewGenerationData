The development and utilization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have significantly evolved since the 1980s, with a critical emphasis on understanding the influence of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. 

        Gallium oxides, notably, received attention approximately two decades ago for their activity in alkane dehydroaromatization, highlighting their potential in petrochemical processing. Their recent resurgence underscores the remarkable promotional effect they exert on carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol, demonstrating a significant shift in their application scope. These catalysts' properties, particularly those of gallium oxides, have undergone substantial development, offering promising alternatives in the realm of petrochemical processing.

        Vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation have seen considerable advancement since the 1980s, with research focusing on elucidating structure-reactivity relationships and enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The surface area plays a pivotal role in determining catalytic activity, aligning closely with maximum activity levels. Activity is notably insensitive to changes in particle size within specified ranges, underscoring the importance of impregnated area over physical structure. The quotes affirm the critical role of surface area in catalytic activity, showcasing a direct correlation and the formation of a monolayer of molybdenum at peak activity.

        Driven by sustainability and cost-effectiveness, vanadium oxide catalysts have emerged as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation. Research since the 1980s has advanced, focusing on understanding the structure-reactivity relationships and enhancing catalyst stability and activity. The factors that significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading.

        Gallium in alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts undergoes transformation from Ga+3 species to a highly dispersed, monomeric hydride form coordinated to oxygen. This hydride species releases hydrogen under high surface hydrogen fugacity, active only at reaction conditions. Upon cooling, the reduced Ga reoxidizes to Ga+3, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist solely under operational conditions. The reversible nature of this transformation underscores the dynamic role of Ga in these catalysts.

        Since the 1980s, research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has focused on carrier materials, support surface area, and metal loading's effect on vanadium species. Key findings include the highest activity after CO reduction, increased i-butene selectivity with Mg, and the formation of V3+ and V4+ species with different coordinations. These species' activity varies, with V4+ (A) considered higher than V3+. The presence of promoters like Mg and Zr alters catalyst properties, impacting activity and selectivity. Experimental setups involve activity measurements at 580°C under atmospheric pressure, with online analysis for products and coke formation.

        Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization. The ratio of propene aromatization to propene hydrogenation rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps. Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation but also alkene conversion rates, increasing the rate of alkane aromatization by enhancing the rate of recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps.

        The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio, peaking at 0.48, resulting in a PtIn alloy with 12% In. Alloying In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation, reducing carbon primarily on the support in ethane dehydrogenation and partly on PtIn nanoparticles in propane dehydrogenation. This alloying also minimally decreases coke deposition, enhancing catalyst longevity and performance.

        The patent data and literature reports have shown that pentasil-type zeolites are attractive acid catalysts for converting light alkanes into aromatics. While it was established that the major role of Pt was to enhance the production of propene from propane, the role of gallium appeared less satisfactorily interpreted. On Ga20s, the major reaction of propane was dehydrogenation into propene, indicating its potential in petrochemical processing. Gallium oxides are not active in the polymerization of olefins but catalyze cyclization of C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons and do not promote hydrogen-transfer reactions between olefins and cycloparaffins, a reaction catalyzed by solid acids.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with enhanced selectivity and stability, exploring the synergistic effects of multiple metals in catalyst formulations, and investigating the use of novel carrier materials and support surfaces that could further optimize vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. Additionally, there is a need to understand the underlying mechanisms governing the dynamic behavior of vanadium species and the role of promoters in catalysis, which could lead to the design of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for petrochemical processing.

        铝酸盐中交换锌离子的修改增加了乙烷和丙烷脱氢的周转率、芳香族位点时间产率和氢消耗速率。丙烷转化为芳香族化合物的比例在锌含量样品中比在H-ZSM5中更高，尽管锌离子增加了脱氢化氢化步骤的速率。锌离子不仅催化烷烃脱氢化，而且催化烯烃转化速率，通过增加在C-H活化步骤中形成的氢原子的再组合脱附率来增加烷烃芳香化。

        Pt/Mg(In)(Al)催化剂用于乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活动性是基本In/Pt比率的强函数，峰值为0.48，导致含有12% In的PtIn合金。In与Pt的合金化显著减少了乙烷和丙烷脱氢期间碳的积累。碳主要在乙烷脱氢中沉积在支撑上，在丙烷脱氢中一部分也沉积在PtIn纳米粒子上。这种合金化也显著减少了焦炭沉积，从而增强了催化剂的寿命和性能。

        专利数据和文献报告表明，五硅基型沸石是将轻烷烃转化为芳烃的有吸引力的酸催化剂。虽然已明确指出铂的主要作用是增强丙烷转化为丙烯的生产，但镓的作用解释得不太令人满意。在Ga20s上，丙烷的主要反应是脱氢生成丙烯，表明它在石油化学加工中的潜在用途。镓氧化物不参与烯烃聚合，但催化C6不饱和烃的环化，并且不促进烯烃和环烷烃之间的氢转移反应，这是由固体酸催化的反应。
