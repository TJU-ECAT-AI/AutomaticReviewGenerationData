            The development and utilization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation have undergone significant progress since the 1980s, aiming to provide more sustainable and economically viable catalytic solutions. The historical context and advancements in this field are deeply intertwined with the optimization of carrier types, support surface areas, and metal loadings, which significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

            Since the pioneering work of the 1980s, researchers have identified the need for catalysts that can operate efficiently under thermodynamic conditions while minimizing the drawbacks associated with traditional Pt and CrOx catalysts. These drawbacks include rapid deactivation, carcinogenic properties of CrOx post-regeneration, and the sensitivity of Pt catalysts to impurities in the feedstock.

            A pivotal development has been the emergence of molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide (SiC) as an active and stable catalyst for paraffin dehydrogenation, demonstrating advantages over CrOx catalysts in terms of stability and reduced health risks. The active phase, composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon, requires hydrogen and steam for formation, highlighting the importance of specific conditions in catalyst activation.

            The carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance. Surface area significantly affects catalytic activity, showing a linear increase with the addition of molybdenum up to an optimal area, beyond which activity increases less rapidly. The insensitivity of activity to particle size changes emphasizes the impact of the impregnated area rather than physical properties of the carrier.

            Beyond molybdenum, modifications of pentasil zeolites with zinc (Zn) cations have shown promise in enhancing turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal efficiency during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization. The incorporation of Zn cations not only catalyzes alkane dehydrogenation but also accelerates alkene conversion rates, thereby increasing the rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products.

            The exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more sustainable and economically viable catalytic systems. Research has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the structure-reactivity relationships of vanadium oxides. The behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts is influenced by various factors, including the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading.

            The dynamic nature of gallium's role in alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts, as observed in reference \[10.1016/jcat.1993.1079\], underscores the importance of understanding the chemical state of elements within catalysts. Gallium species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps, transforming from Ga+3 species to a monomeric hydride species during reactions, facilitating hydrogen release.

            The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt, as exemplified by the interaction between tin (Sn) and platinum (Pt), can significantly influence the catalyst's properties. Studies suggest that Sn forms a variety of bimetallic alloys, enhancing the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuating the adsorption of the product alkene, thereby increasing alkene selectivity.

            Mg(Ga)(Al)O, with its moderately basic and high thermal stability properties, has become particularly attractive as a support material for Pt-based catalysts. This support allows for the preparation of catalysts with elements other than aluminum (Al), such as zinc (Zn), gallium (Ga), and indium (In), broadening the scope of catalyst design.

            The integration of gallium oxides, previously noted for alkane dehydroaromatization, has gained renewed interest due to their remarkable promoting influence for carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol. This showcases the versatility and enhanced functionality of vanadium oxide-based catalysts across various chemical transformations.

            The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation represent a pivotal step in the evolution of catalytic technologies. These catalysts offer improved stability, selectivity, and environmental compatibility, addressing the challenges posed by traditional catalysts and paving the way for more sustainable industrial applications.

            The integrative understanding and prospective outlook based on the detailed analysis of the aforementioned references suggest that there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of catalyst composition, the development of novel carrier materials, and the investigation of synergistic effects between multiple metals and carriers to further enhance catalyst performance and broaden the scope of applications. The goal would be to create catalysts that not only match but exceed the performance of traditional Pt and CrOx catalysts, ensuring efficient and environmentally friendly paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

            镁镓铝（Mg(Ga)(Al)O），因其中等碱性和高热稳定性的特性，已成为Pt基催化剂的特别吸引人的支持材料。这种支持允许使用除铝（Al）以外的元素制备催化剂，如锌（Zn）、镓（Ga）和铟（In），拓宽了催化剂设计的视野。

            镓氧化物，以前因烷烃脱氢芳构化而受到关注，最近因其促进二氧化碳氢化成甲醇的非凡影响力而重新引起了人们的兴趣。这表明了范德瓦尔氧化物基催化剂在各种化学转化方面的灵活性和增强的功能性。
