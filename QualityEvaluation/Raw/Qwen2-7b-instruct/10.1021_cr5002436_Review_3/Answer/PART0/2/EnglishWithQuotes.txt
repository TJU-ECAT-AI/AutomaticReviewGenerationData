The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without Mg and Zr was examined in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure. The dehydrogenation activity was found to be highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased with the addition of Mg. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of V3+ species and two types of V4+ species with different coordination environments on the catalyst surface during CO reduction. The goal of this work was to investigate the impact of Mg and Zr as promoters on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts.\n\n          Activity measurements were performed at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor. The products were analyzed online using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.). Conversion and selectivities were calculated based on the carbon balance from the reactor product. The vanadium and promoter contents of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts are presented in Table 1. The XRD pattern of the V5 catalyst displayed reflections typical of the alumina support. It was noted that the presence of Mg vanadates cannot be ruled out due to the possibility of their crystal size being below the detection limit of the method (3133). The crystalline size of all the catalysts, as calculated from the half-width of the diffraction peak from γ-alumina using the Scherrer equation, was 58 2 A. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were comparable to the BET surface area of the alumina support treated under identical conditions. The ESR spectra of the sample V5 after different treatments are shown in Figure 6. Species A and B were characterized by specific ESR parameters. Species A was predominant after calcination, while species B was more present after CO reduction. The amounts of V4+ relative to the total V content were similar after calcination and hydrogen reduction for the three catalysts under study.\n\n          The research focused on understanding how Mg and Zr, as promoters, affect the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and the formation of specific vanadium species on the catalyst surface.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.2001.3329"},
