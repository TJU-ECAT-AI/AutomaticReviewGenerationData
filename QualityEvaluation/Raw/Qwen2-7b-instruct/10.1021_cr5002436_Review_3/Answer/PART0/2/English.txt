The modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc cations lead to enhanced turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during the aromatization of ethane, propane, and propene. Zinc cations not only facilitate the dehydrogenation of alkanes (r1) but also accelerate the conversion of alkenes. The zinc cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization through the acceleration of hydrogen recombination desorption from the C-H activation steps.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and possibly more selective alternatives. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on understanding the unique catalytic properties of vanadium oxides under different conditions. Key factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables impact the electronic structure and redox properties of vanadium, affecting its ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions efficiently and selectively. For instance, the choice of carrier material can alter the dispersion of vanadium species, influencing their reactivity and stability. Surface area affects the availability of active sites for reaction, while metal loading impacts the concentration of vanadium ions participating in catalytic processes. Overall, optimizing these parameters is crucial for enhancing the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, aiming to achieve higher yields of aromatics with improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact.

Several drawbacks are associated with chromium oxide and platinum catalysts used for paraffin dehydrogenation. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, and a part of the regenerated chromium is in the carcinogenic oxidation state Cr6+. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.

          Silicon carbide materials have been widely utilized in various applications due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and mechanical strength. Their use in catalysis exploits these properties.

          Molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide (SiC) has demonstrated significant activity in the isomerization of n-paraffins. This suggests that the SiC support enhances the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide.

          In the context of dehydrogenation, the active phase was found to consist of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon, confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is critical for the formation of the most active and stable phase, which is likely composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.

          Among the catalysts tested, those supported on SiC showed the best selectivity for dehydrogenation. This indicates that the SiC support facilitates the optimal formation of the active dehydrogenation catalyst phase.

Ethylene, propylene, and butene are widely used in the production of rubber, plastics, and various other products. Thermal dehydrogenation, similar to steam cracking, is an endothermic process occurring at temperatures between 973 and 1073 K. It can also generate methane and coke as secondary products.

The relationship between surface area and activity was examined for molybdenum impregnated onto activated alumina. It was found that activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was reached. Further increase of area led to a much slower increase in activity. At maximum activity, the alumina surface was covered with a monolayer of molybdenum, and the activity was relatively insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range.

There are no specific quotes provided in the document regarding the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s, or how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

The addition of Ga to the hydrotalcite-like precursor material led to a slight decrease in the surface area and pore volume of the calcined support. The dispersion of the Pt particles was determined using H2 chemisorption, as detailed in Table 2. As the ratio of Ga to the total of Ga and Al in the support increased, the average size of the supported Pt particles increased from 1.2 nm to 2.2 nm. During H2 reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at temperatures between 773 and 873 K, some Ga3+ ions near the surface were reduced to Ga atoms by hydrogen atoms diffusing from the supported Pt particles, resulting in the formation of PtGa alloys with Ga/Pt ratios ranging from 0.1 to 1.1.

The influence of promoters magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts was studied. The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without Mg and Zr was examined in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure. The dehydrogenation activity was found to be highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased with the addition of Mg. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of V3+ species and two types of V4+ species with different coordination environments on the catalyst surface during CO reduction. The goal of this work was to investigate the impact of Mg and Zr as promoters on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

          Activity measurements were performed at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor. The products were analyzed online using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.). Conversion and selectivities were calculated based on the carbon balance from the reactor product. The vanadium and promoter contents of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts are presented in Table 1. The XRD pattern of the V5 catalyst displayed reflections typical of the alumina support. It was noted that the presence of Mg vanadates cannot be ruled out due to the possibility of their crystal size being below the detection limit of the method (3133). The crystalline size of all the catalysts, as calculated from the half-width of the diffraction peak from γ-alumina using the Scherrer equation, was 58 2 A. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were comparable to the BET surface area of the alumina support treated under identical conditions. The ESR spectra of the sample V5 after different treatments are shown in Figure 6. Species A and B were characterized by specific ESR parameters. Species A was predominant after calcination, while species B was more present after CO reduction. The amounts of V4+ relative to the total V content were similar after calcination and hydrogen reduction for the three catalysts under study.

          The research focused on understanding how Mg and Zr, as promoters, affect the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and the formation of specific vanadium species on the catalyst surface.

The products were analyzed online using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.). Conversion and selectivities were calculated based on the carbon balance from the reactor product. The vanadium and promoter contents of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts are presented in Table 1. The XRD pattern of the V5 catalyst displayed reflections typical of the alumina support. It was noted that the presence of Mg vanadates cannot be ruled out due to the possibility of their crystal size being below the detection limit of the method (3133). The crystalline size of all the catalysts, as calculated from the half-width of the diffraction peak from γ-alumina using the Scherrer equation, was 58 2 A. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were comparable to the BET surface area of the alumina support treated under identical conditions. The ESR spectra of the sample V5 after different treatments are shown in Figure 6. Species A and B were characterized by specific ESR parameters. Species A was predominant after calcination, while species B was more present after CO reduction. The amounts of V4+ relative to the total V content were similar after calcination and hydrogen reduction for the three catalysts under study.

          The research focused on understanding how Mg and Zr, as promoters, affect the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and the formation of specific vanadium species on the catalyst surface.

The modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc cations lead to enhanced turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during the aromatization of ethane, propane, and propene. Zinc cations not only facilitate the dehydrogenation of alkanes (r1) but also accelerate the conversion of alkenes. The zinc cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization through the acceleration of hydrogen recombination desorption from the C-H activation steps.

1. The document does not discuss vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential to offer cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and possibly more selective alternatives. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on understanding the unique catalytic properties of vanadium oxides under different conditions. Key factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. These variables impact the electronic structure and redox properties of vanadium, affecting its ability to promote dehydrogenation reactions efficiently and selectively. For instance, the choice of carrier material can alter the dispersion of vanadium species, influencing their reactivity and stability. Surface area affects the availability of active sites for reaction, while metal loading impacts the concentration of vanadium ions participating in catalytic processes. Overall, optimizing these parameters is crucial for enhancing the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, aiming to achieve higher yields of aromatics with improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact.

Several drawbacks are associated with chromium oxide and platinum catalysts used for paraffin dehydrogenation. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, and a part of the regenerated chromium is in the carcinogenic oxidation state Cr6+. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.

          Since the 1980s, research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly. The focus has been on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

          Silicon carbide materials have been widely utilized in various applications due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and mechanical strength. Their use in catalysis exploits these properties.

          Molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide (SiC) has demonstrated significant activity in the isomerization of n-paraffins. This suggests that the SiC support enhances the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide.

          In the context of dehydrogenation, the active phase was found to consist of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon, confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is critical for the formation of the most active and stable phase, which is likely composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.

          Among the catalysts tested, those supported on SiC showed the best selectivity for dehydrogenation. This indicates that the SiC support facilitates the optimal formation of the active dehydrogenation catalyst phase.

Ethylene, propylene, and butene are widely used in the production of rubber, plastics, and various other products. Thermal dehydrogenation, similar to steam cracking, is an endothermic process occurring at temperatures between 973 and 1073 K. It can also generate methane and coke as secondary products.

The relationship between surface area and activity was examined for molybdenum impregnated onto activated alumina. It was found that activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was reached. Further increase of area led to a much slower increase in activity. At maximum activity, the alumina surface was covered with a monolayer of molybdenum, and the activity was relatively insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range.

There are no specific quotes provided in the document regarding the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s, or how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

The addition of Ga to the hydrotalcite-like precursor material led to a slight decrease in the surface area and pore volume of the calcined support. The dispersion of the Pt particles was determined using H2 chemisorption, as detailed in Table 2. As the ratio of Ga to the total of Ga and Al in the support increased, the average size of the supported Pt particles increased from 1.2 nm to 2.2 nm. During H2 reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at temperatures between 773 and 873 K, some Ga3+ ions near the surface were reduced to Ga atoms by hydrogen atoms diffusing from the supported Pt particles, resulting in the formation of PtGa alloys with Ga/Pt ratios ranging from 0.1 to 1.1.

The influence of promoters magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts was studied. The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without Mg and Zr was examined in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure. The dehydrogenation activity was found to be highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased with the addition of Mg. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of V3+ species and two types of V4+ species with different coordination environments on the catalyst surface during CO reduction. The goal of this work was to investigate the impact of Mg and Zr as promoters on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts.
