[1] "More recently, interest in the dehydrocyclization of propane over H-ZSM-5-supported metals, as well over metal silicates, has been intensified to ascertain the importance of the added metal on the overall reaction."
          [2] "While it was clearly established that the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] was to enhance the production of propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary intermediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory interpreted."

          [8] "The remarkable increase in the yield of aromatics from catalytic conversion of propane when H-ZSM-5 was promoted with gallium is thus reasonably understood as the result of the dehydrogenating properties of gallium oxide, which easily generate trienes from alkenes."

"[1] Two types of catalyst are currently used in the commercial dehydrogenation processes of isobutane: supported chromium oxide and supported platinum metal [1,2].
          [3] Since their development several decades ago, silicon carbide materials have been used in a broad range of applications [3] that exploit their high thermal conductivity, high resistance to oxidation, considerable chemical inertness and good mechanical strength.
          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins [9,10].
          [5] The active phase in dehydrogenation was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.
          [6] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the most active and stable phase, and the amount of steam was critical.
          [7] Selectivity for dehydrogenation was best with the SiC supported catalyst."

          [2] "Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained."
          [3] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
          [4] "Comparison of the calculated molybdenum area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdenum at maximum activity."
          [5] "Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh."
