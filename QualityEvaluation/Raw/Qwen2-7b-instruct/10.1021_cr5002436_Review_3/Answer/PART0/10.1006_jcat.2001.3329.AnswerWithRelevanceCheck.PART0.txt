          Researchers have explored the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for the dehydrogenation of paraffins. Since the 1980s, this field of research has evolved, focusing on the role of carrier materials, support surface area, and metal loading in determining the activity and selectivity of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables such as the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Alumina is commonly used as a support due to its high surface area and stability. The surface area of the support affects the dispersion of vanadium oxide particles, influencing the availability of active sites. Metal loading refers to the amount of vanadium relative to the support, impacting the redox properties and the ability of the catalyst to undergo various transformations. Metal promoters like magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) can alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, affecting its activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

          The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without magnesium and zirconium was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure. The activity was evaluated after reduction with hydrogen and carbon monoxide, varying with the amount of promoter added. The dehydrogenation activity was highest after carbon monoxide reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased with the addition of magnesium. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of vanadium species with different coordination environments during carbon monoxide reduction. Both vanadium species, V4+ (A) and V3+, were found to be active in the dehydrogenation process, with the activity of V4+ (A) considered higher than that of V3+. The activity of the catalysts with and without promoters was studied as a function of reaction time and pretreatment.

          Activity measurements were conducted at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor, utilizing a Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.) for product analysis. Hydrocarbons formed during the dehydrogenation were also analyzed online with a gas chromatograph (GC) HP 6890 after 10 minutes on stream. The carbon balance did not account for the coke formed on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation. Some of the catalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts were heated to 580-585°C under 5% oxygen flow in the fixed-bed microreactor and then reduced with 5% hydrogen or carbon monoxide in nitrogen for 30 minutes before XPS analysis.

          自1980年代以来，研究人员已探索以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品，用于烷烃的脱氢反应。这一领域的发展着重于载体材料、支持表面面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中五氧化二钒物种的活性和选择性的影响。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等因素影响五氧化二钒物种的性质和行为。氧化铝通常用作支持材料，因其高表面积和稳定性。支持材料的表面积影响了五氧化二钒颗粒的分散，从而影响活性位点的可用性。金属负载指的是相对于支持材料的五氧化二钒含量，这影响了催化剂的还原性质及其在脱氢反应中的各种转化能力。镁（Mg）和锆（Zr）等金属促进剂可以改变催化剂的电子性质，从而影响其活性和选择性。

          在580°C下，在大气压力下对含有和不含镁和锆的氧化铝支持的五氧化二钒催化剂进行了脱氢化异丁烷和正丁烷的研究。活动性在氢气和一氧化碳还原后进行评估，根据促进剂的量变化。脱氢化活性在使用碳一氧化碳后最高，添加镁后i-己烯的选择性增加。X射线光电子光谱、电子自旋共振、温度程序化还原和傅里叶变换红外测量揭示了碳一氧化碳还原过程中催化剂表面上具有不同配位环境的五氧化二钒物种的形成。在脱氢化过程中，两种五氧化二钒物种，V4+（A）和V3+，均被发现是活性的，其中V4+（A）被认为比V3+更活跃。含有和不含有促进剂的催化剂的活性随反应时间和预处理的变化进行了研究。

          活性测量在580°C下在固定床微反应器中进行，利用傅里叶变换红外气体分析仪（Gasmet，Temet仪器有限公司）对产品进行分析。在10分钟后进行气相色谱分析（GC）HP 6890，以在线分析脱氢化过程中形成的烃类化合物。碳平衡没有考虑催化剂上形成的焦炭。一些催化剂通过X射线光电子光谱（XPS）进行了分析。催化剂被加热到580-585°C，在固定床微反应器中以5%的氧气流速下，然后在室温下用氢或一氧化碳在氮气中还原30分钟，然后再进行XPS分析。

          The influence of promoters magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts was studied. The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without Mg and Zr was examined in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure. The dehydrogenation activity was found to be highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased with the addition of Mg. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of V3+ species and two types of V4+ species with different coordination environments on the catalyst surface during CO reduction. The goal of this work was to investigate the impact of Mg and Zr as promoters on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

          Activity measurements were performed at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor. The products were analyzed online using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.). Conversion and selectivities were calculated based on the carbon balance from the reactor product. The vanadium and promoter contents of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts are presented in Table 1. The XRD pattern of the V5 catalyst displayed reflections typical of the alumina support. It was noted that the presence of Mg vanadates cannot be ruled out due to the possibility of their crystal size being below the detection limit of the method (3133). The crystalline size of all the catalysts, as calculated from the half-width of the diffraction peak from γ-alumina using the Scherrer equation, was 58 2 A. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were comparable to the BET surface area of the alumina support treated under identical conditions. The ESR spectra of the sample V5 after different treatments are shown in Figure 6. Species A and B were characterized by specific ESR parameters. Species A was predominant after calcination, while species B was more present after CO reduction. The amounts of V4+ relative to the total V content were similar after calcination and hydrogen reduction for the three catalysts under study.

          The research focused on understanding how Mg and Zr, as promoters, affect the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, particularly in terms of activity, selectivity, and the formation of specific vanadium species on the catalyst surface.

          探讨了镁（Mg）和锆（Zr）作为促进剂对支持的范德华氧化物催化剂催化性能的影响。在580°C下，在大气压力下，对含有和不含镁和锆的氧化铝支持的范德华氧化物催化剂的初始活性进行了研究，用于脱氢异丁烷和正丁烷。在CO还原后，脱氢活性最高，添加镁后i-己烯的选择性增加。X射线光电子光谱、电子自旋共振、温度程序化还原和傅里叶变换红外测量揭示了在CO还原过程中，催化剂表面上形成了V3+物种以及两种不同配位的V4+物种（A和B）。研究的目的是探讨镁和锆作为促进剂对支持的范德华氧化物催化剂催化性能的影响。

          活性测量在580°C下在固定床微反应器中进行。产品通过傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）气体分析仪（Gasmet，Temet仪器有限公司）在线分析。基于碳平衡计算转换率和选择性。表1列出了支持的范德华氧化物催化剂中的钒和促进剂含量。V5催化剂的XRD模式显示了典型的铝酸盐支持反射。由于其晶体尺寸可能低于方法的检测限（3133），因此无法排除镁范德华盐的存在。所有催化剂的晶粒尺寸，通过施瑞克方程从γ-氧化铝的衍射峰半宽度计算得出，为58 2 A。催化剂的BET表面积与在相同条件下处理的氧化铝支持的BET表面积相当。样本V5在不同处理后的ESR谱图见图6。物种A和B具有特定的ESR参数。在煅烧后，物种A占主导地位，而在使用CO进行还原后，物种B的量更大。三种催化剂下，煅烧和氢还原后V4+相对于总V含量的比例相似。

          研究侧重于理解镁和锆作为促进剂如何影响在烷烃脱氢过程中支持的范德华氧化物催化剂的催化性能，特别是在活性、选择性和催化剂表面特定范德华物种形成方面的表现。
