          Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation due to the demand for more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems. Research in this field has advanced notably since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the structure-reactivity relationship and improving the stability and activity of vanadium-based catalysts. The characteristics and actions of vanadium species within these catalysts are affected by several factors, such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.
