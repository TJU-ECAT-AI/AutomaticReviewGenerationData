"The catalytic properties of promoted and unpromoted iron oxides are well documented, because of their dehydrogenation activity and practical use, for instance in styrene production."
          "The catalysts demonstrated a very low activity (Table 2) but unique characteristics as exemplified by the data reported in Table 3, where the selectivities obtained over the four materials at nearly identical conversion levels are compared."
