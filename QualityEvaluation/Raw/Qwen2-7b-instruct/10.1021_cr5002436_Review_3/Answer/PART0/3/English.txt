Iron oxides, both promoted and unpromoted, are well-established for their dehydrogenation activity and practical applications, particularly in styrene production. Despite showing minimal activity (Table 2), the catalysts displayed unique characteristics, as evidenced by the comparison of selectivities across the four materials at nearly identical conversion levels (Table 3).
