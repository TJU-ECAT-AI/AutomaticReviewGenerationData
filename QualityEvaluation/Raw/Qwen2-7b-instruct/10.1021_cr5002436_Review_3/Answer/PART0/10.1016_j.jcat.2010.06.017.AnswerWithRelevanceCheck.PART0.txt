          "Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers."
          "A further attraction of alkane dehydrogenation is that hydrogen, the principal byproduct, is a valuable commodity that can readily be used for many purposes within a petroleum refinery,e.g., hydrocracking and heteroatom removal."
          "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."
          "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re."
          "The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn. EXAFS, Mossbauer, and TEM studies of supported SnPt catalysts suggest that Sn forms a variety of bimetallic alloys, which enhance the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene."
          "The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself."
          "Mg(Ga)(Al)O is particularly attractive because it is moderately basic and exhibits high thermal stability to steam and reaction-oxidation cycling."
          "In a recent study, we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."
          "A further attraction of hydrotalcite-derived supports is that they can be prepared with elements other than Al, e.g., Zn, Ga, In."
          "We have recently exploited this characteristic by preparing and evaluating a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on optimizing catalyst properties such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to improve the performance and selectivity of vanadium species in these catalysts.

          "The addition of Ga to the hydrotalcite-like precursor material caused a small decrease in the surface area of the calcined support as well as the pore volume."
          "The dispersion of the Pt particles on calcined hydrotalcite-like supports, determined by H2 chemisorption, is presented in Table 2."
          "The size of the supported particles increased from an average of 1.2 nm to 2.2 nm as the Ga/(Ga + Al) ratio increased from 0 to 1."
          "Upon H2 reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at 773873 K, a portion of the Ga3+ cations near the surface are reduced to Ga atoms by H atoms spilled over from the supported Pt particles, leading to the formation of PtGa alloys ranging in Ga/Pt ratio from 0.1 to 1.1."

          The addition of Ga to the hydrotalcite-like precursor material led to a slight decrease in the surface area and pore volume of the calcined support. The dispersion of the Pt particles was determined using H2 chemisorption, as detailed in Table 2. As the ratio of Ga to the total of Ga and Al in the support increased, the average size of the supported Pt particles increased from 1.2 nm to 2.2 nm. During H2 reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at temperatures between 773 and 873 K, some Ga3+ ions near the surface were reduced to Ga atoms by hydrogen atoms diffusing from the supported Pt particles, resulting in the formation of PtGa alloys with Ga/Pt ratios ranging from 0.1 to 1.1.

          添加镓到类水滑石前体材料中导致煅烧支撑物的表面积和孔体积略有下降。Pt粒子的分散通过H2化学吸附确定，详情见表2。随着支持物中Ga与Ga+Al总和的比例从0增加到1，支持的Pt颗粒的平均尺寸从1.2 nm增加到2.2 nm。在773至873 K的H2还原下，部分靠近表面的Ga3+离子被扩散自支持的Pt颗粒上的氢原子还原为Ga原子，从而形成Ga/Pt比介于0.1至1.1之间的PtGa合金。
