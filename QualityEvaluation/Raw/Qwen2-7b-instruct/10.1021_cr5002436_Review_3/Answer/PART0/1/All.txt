Hydrocarbons formed during the dehydrogenation were also analyzed online with a gas chromatograph (GC) HP 6890 after 10 minutes on stream. The carbon balance did not account for the coke formed on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation. Some of the catalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts were heated to 580-585°C under 5% oxygen flow in the fixed-bed microreactor and then reduced with 5% hydrogen or carbon monoxide in nitrogen for 30 minutes before XPS analysis.", "Chinese": "自1980年代以来，研究人员已探索以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品，用于烷烃的脱氢反应。这一领域的发展着重于载体材料、支持表面面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中五氧化二钒物种的活性和选择性的影响。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等因素影响五氧化二钒物种的性质和行为。氧化铝通常用作支持材料，因其高表面积和稳定性。支持材料的表面积影响了五氧化二钒颗粒的分散，从而影响活性位点的可用性。金属负载指的是相对于支持材料的五氧化二钒含量，这影响了催化剂的还原性质及其在脱氢反应中的各种转化能力。镁（Mg）和锆（Zr）等金属促进剂可以改变催化剂的电子性质，从而影响其活性和选择性。\n\n          在580°C下，在大气压力下对含有和不含镁和锆的氧化铝支持的五氧化二钒催化剂进行了脱氢化异丁烷和正丁烷的研究。活动性在氢气和一氧化碳还原后进行评估，根据促进剂的量变化。脱氢化活性在使用碳一氧化碳后最高，添加镁后i-己烯的选择性增加。X射线光电子光谱、电子自旋共振、温度程序化还原和傅里叶变换红外测量揭示了碳一氧化碳还原过程中催化剂表面上具有不同配位环境的五氧化二钒物种的形成。在脱氢化过程中，两种五氧化二钒物种，V4+（A）和V3+，均被发现是活性的，其中V4+（A）被认为比V3+更活跃。含有和不含有促进剂的催化剂的活性随反应时间和预处理的变化进行了研究。\n\n          活性测量在580°C下在固定床微反应器中进行，利用傅里叶变换红外气体分析仪（Gasmet，Temet仪器有限公司）对产品进行分析。在10分钟后进行气相色谱分析（GC）HP 6890，以在线分析脱氢化过程中形成的烃类化合物。碳平衡没有考虑催化剂上形成的焦炭。一些催化剂通过X射线光电子光谱（XPS）进行了分析。催化剂被加热到580-585°C，在固定床微反应器中以5%的氧气流速下，然后在室温下用氢或一氧化碳在氮气中还原30分钟，然后再进行XPS分析。", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.2001.3329"},
