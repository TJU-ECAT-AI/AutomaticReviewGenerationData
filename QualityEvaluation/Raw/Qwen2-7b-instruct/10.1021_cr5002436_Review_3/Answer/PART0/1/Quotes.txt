[L7] "Patent data [ 1 - 31 and literature reports [4 - 71 have shown that pentasil-type zeolites are attractive acid catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes into aromatics."
          [L8] "While it was clearly established that the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] was to enhance the production of propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary intermediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory interpreted."

"[1] For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst systems.
          [2] However, several drawbacks are associated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.
          [3] The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.
          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins.
          [5] In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions.
          [6] Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.
          [7] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.
          [8] The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst."

          "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."
          "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

          [4] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
          [5] "Compari-son of the calculated molybdenum area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdenum at maximum activity."
          [6] "Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh."

[1] "Exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more sustainable and economically viable catalytic systems."
          [2] "Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the structure-reactivity relationships of vanadium oxides."
          [3] "The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors including the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading."

"Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers."
          "A further attraction of alkane dehydrogenation is that hydrogen, the principal byproduct, is a valuable commodity that can readily be used for many purposes within a petroleum refinery,e.g., hydrocracking and heteroatom removal."
          "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."
          "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re."
          "The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn. EXAFS, Mossbauer, and TEM studies of supported SnPt catalysts suggest that Sn forms a variety of bimetallic alloys, which enhance the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene."
          "The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself."

          [3] "The dehydro- genation activity was highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased and the formation of coke decreased with the addition of Mg."
          [4] "According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,electron spin resonance, temperature programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, during CO reduction, V3+ species and two kinds of V4+ species with different coordina- tions (A and B) were formed on the catalyst surface."
          [5] "Apparently both V4+ and V3+ species were active in the dehydrogenation, and tentatively, we conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than that of V3+."
          [6] "The activity of supported vanadium oxide, with and without a promotor, was studied here as a function of re- action time and the catalyst pretreatment."

[L7] "Patent data [ 1 - 31 and literature reports [4 - 71 have shown that pentasil-type zeolites are attractive acid catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes into aromatics."
          [L8] "While it was clearly established that the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] was to enhance the production of propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary intermediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory interpreted."

"[1] For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst systems.
          [2] However, several drawbacks are associated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.
          [3] The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.
          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins.
          [5] In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions.
          [6] Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.
          [7] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.
          [8] The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst."

          [2] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."
          [3] "Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates."
          [4] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
          [5] "Hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts."
          [6] "Reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 lead primarily to undesired products of β-scission reactions."
          [7] "Turnover rates, aro- matic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during alkane conversion increase as the density of exchanged Zn cations increases in H-ZSM5."
          [8] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles,leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aro- matic products."
          [9] "Zn species increase the rate of propane dehydrogenation (r1); therefore, they must also catalyze the reverse reaction: propene hydrogenation (r1)."
          [10] "Relative rates of propene hydrogenation (r1) and conversion to other products (r2) (Scheme 2) can be measured from the rate of isotopic scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene and from the isotopic content of the other reaction products."

"The catalytic properties of gallium and gallium oxides supported on aluminosilicates have received attention some 20 years ago owing to their activity in alkane dehydroaromatisation [23,24]."
          "Interest for gallium oxides has been renewed recently on account of their remarkable promoting influence for carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol [25,26]."

[L7] "Patent data [ 1 - 31 and literature reports [4 - 71 have shown that pentasil-type zeolites are attractive acid catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes into aromatics."
          [L8] "While it was clearly established that the major role of Pt [8] or Zn [4,9] was to enhance the production of propene from propane, CsH, being considered the first necessary intermediate in the overall reaction steps leading to the formation of aromatics from propane, the role of gallium appeared to be less satisfactory interpreted."
          [L9] "On Ga20s, the major reaction of propane was the dehydrogenation into propene."
          [L10] "Ga*Os is not active in the polymerization of olefins."
          [L11] "Ga,O, catalyzes cyclization of C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons."
          [L12] "Ga,O, does not promote hydrogen-transfer reactions between olefins and cycloparaffins, a reaction catalyzed by solid acids."
          [L13] "With l-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene, and probably with other paraffins, aromatic hydrocarbons are formed via dehydrogenation of the paraffin to generate dienes and trienes."

"[1] For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst systems.
          [2] However, several drawbacks are associated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.
          [3] The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.
          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins.
          [5] In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions.
          [6] Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.
          [7] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.
          [8] The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst."

"The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."
          "The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios."
          "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."
          "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[1] "The development of a simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials (1) provided a basis for correlating information on the action of adsorbents in this application."
          [2] "Activated aluminas were impregnated with varying quantities of molybdenum and their catalytic activities determined for dehydrocyclization of n-heptane to toluene at atmospheric pressure."
          [3] "Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained."
          [4] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
          [5] "Compari-son of the calculated molybdenum area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdenum at maximum activity."
          [6] "Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh."

[1] "Exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more sustainable and economically viable catalytic systems."
          [2] "Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in understanding the structure-reactivity relationships of vanadium oxides."
          [3] "The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors including the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading."

"Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers."
          "A further attraction of alkane dehydrogenation is that hydrogen, the principal byproduct, is a valuable commodity that can readily be used for many purposes within a petroleum refinery,e.g., hydrocracking and heteroatom removal."
          "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."
          "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re."
          "The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn. EXAFS, Mossbauer, and TEM studies of supported SnPt catalysts suggest that Sn forms a variety of bimetallic alloys, which enhance the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene."
          "The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself."
          "Mg(Ga)(Al)O is particularly attractive because it is moderately basic and exhibits high thermal stability to steam and reaction-oxidation cycling."
          "In a recent study, we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."
          "A further attraction of hydrotalcite-derived supports is that they can be prepared with elements other than Al, e.g., Zn, Ga, In."
          "We have recently exploited this characteristic by preparing and evaluating a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."

[1] "The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide cata- lysts with and without Mg and Zr was studied in the dehydrogena- tion of i-butane and n-butane at 580C under atmospheric pres- sure."
          [2] "The catalyst activity was evaluated, after reduction with H2 and CO, as a function of the amount of the promotor."
          [3] "The dehydro- genation activity was highest after CO reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased and the formation of coke decreased with the addition of Mg."
          [4] "According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,electron spin resonance, temperature programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, during CO reduction, V3+ species and two kinds of V4+ species with different coordina- tions (A and B) were formed on the catalyst surface."
          [5] "Apparently both V4+ and V3+ species were active in the dehydrogenation, and tentatively, we conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than that of V3+."
          [6] "The activity of supported vanadium oxide, with and without a promotor, was studied here as a function of re- action time and the catalyst pretreatment."
          [7] "The activity measurements were carried out at 580C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor."
          [8] "The products were analyzed on-line with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.)."
          [9] "The hydrocarbons formed during the dehydrogenation were also analyzed on-line with a gas chromatograph (GC) HP 6890 after 10 min on stream."
          [10] "The coke formed on the catalyst dur- ing the dehydrogenation was not taken into account in the carbon balance."
          [11] "Some of the catalysts were investigated with XPS. For this purpose, the catalysts were heated to 580585C under 5% oxygen flow in the fixed-bed microreactor and some of the catalysts were then reduced with 5% H2 or 5% CO in N2 for 30 min."
