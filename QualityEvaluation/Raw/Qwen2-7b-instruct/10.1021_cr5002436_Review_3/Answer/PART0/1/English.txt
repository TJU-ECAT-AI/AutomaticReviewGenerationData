The modification of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc cations leads to increased turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization. The ratio of propene aromatization to propene hydrogenation rates is higher on catalysts containing zinc compared to H-ZSM5, despite zinc increasing the rate of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps. Zinc cations not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes but also accelerate the conversion of alkenes. Zinc cations enhance the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of hydrogen recombination desorption from the activation of C-H bonds.

The chemical state of gallium in working alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts involves Ga species initially present in fresh catalysts that reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, likely as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, indicating that active forms of Ga exist only under reaction conditions.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. The development of silicon carbide (SiC) materials has shown promise in various applications, including catalytic processes due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and good mechanical strength. These properties, combined with their ability to be prepared with high surface area, make SiC a suitable candidate for use as a catalyst support.

          Research has indicated that molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. This is advantageous compared to chromium oxide catalysts, which deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, often leaving carcinogenic Cr6+ ions after regeneration. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.

          The active phase in dehydrogenation consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is crucial for the formation of this active phase. This phase likely comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity observed in this catalyst system. The surface area of the support, metal loading, and carrier type influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the current performance of the system is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium under the tested conditions. Further improvements are needed for it to be ready for industrial use.

          Earlier studies showed that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane but is unstable under the required reaction conditions. In contrast, molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation. The active phase involves molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is necessary for the formation of this active phase, which likely consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is located on the catalyst's uppermost layer. The active phase on the silica-supported catalyst might contain more carbon (carbide-like phase), resulting in a non-selective catalyst.

The efficiency of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation depends significantly on the bulk In/Pt ratio. A peak activity is reached at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, resulting in a PtIn alloy with 12% In. Alloying In with Pt leads to a substantial reduction in carbon accumulation during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Carbon deposition primarily occurs on the support during ethane dehydrogenation, and a portion also accumulates on PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation.

Variables such as the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Alumina is commonly used as a support due to its high surface area and stability. The surface area of the support affects the dispersion of vanadium oxide particles, influencing the availability of active sites. Metal loading refers to the amount of vanadium relative to the support, impacting the redox properties and the ability of the catalyst to undergo various transformations. Metal promoters like magnesium (Mg) and zirconium (Zr) can alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, affecting its activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

          The initial activity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts with and without magnesium and zirconium was studied in the dehydrogenation of i-butane and n-butane at 580°C under atmospheric pressure.

The dehydrogenation activity was highest after carbon monoxide reduction, and the selectivity toward i-butene increased with the addition of magnesium. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of vanadium species with different coordination environments during carbon monoxide reduction. Both vanadium species, V4+ (A) and V3+, were found to be active in the dehydrogenation process, with the activity of V4+ (A) considered higher than that of V3+. The activity of the catalysts with and without promoters was studied as a function of reaction time and pretreatment.

          Activity measurements were conducted at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor, utilizing a Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.) for product analysis. Hydrocarbons formed during the dehydrogenation were also analyzed online with a gas chromatograph (GC) HP 6890 after 10 minutes on stream. The carbon balance did not account for the coke formed on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation. Some of the catalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts were heated to 580-585°C under 5% oxygen flow in the fixed-bed microreactor and then reduced with 5% hydrogen or carbon monoxide in nitrogen for 30 minutes before XPS analysis.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, temperature-programmed reduction, and Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed the formation of vanadium species with different coordination environments during carbon monoxide reduction. Both vanadium species, V4+ (A) and V3+, were found to be active in the dehydrogenation process, with the activity of V4+ (A) considered higher than that of V3+. The activity of the catalysts with and without promoters was studied as a function of reaction time and pretreatment.

          Activity measurements were conducted at 580°C under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed microreactor, utilizing a Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer (Gasmet, Temet Instruments Ltd.) for product analysis. Hydrocarbons formed during the dehydrogenation were also analyzed online with a gas chromatograph (GC) HP 6890 after 10 minutes on stream. The carbon balance did not account for the coke formed on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation. Some of the catalysts were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The catalysts were heated to 580-585°C under 5% oxygen flow in the fixed-bed microreactor and then reduced with 5% hydrogen or carbon monoxide in nitrogen for 30 minutes before XPS analysis.

The modification of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc cations leads to increased turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization. The ratio of propene aromatization to propene hydrogenation rates is higher on catalysts containing zinc compared to H-ZSM5, despite zinc increasing the rate of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps. Zinc cations not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes but also accelerate the conversion of alkenes. Zinc cations enhance the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of hydrogen recombination desorption from the activation of C-H bonds.

The chemical state of gallium in working alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts involves Ga species initially present in fresh catalysts that reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, likely as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, indicating that active forms of Ga exist only under reaction conditions.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. The development of silicon carbide (SiC) materials has shown promise in various applications, including catalytic processes due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and good mechanical strength. These properties, combined with their ability to be prepared with high surface area, make SiC a suitable candidate for use as a catalyst support.

          Research has indicated that molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. This is advantageous compared to chromium oxide catalysts, which deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, often leaving carcinogenic Cr6+ ions after regeneration. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.

          The active phase in dehydrogenation consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is crucial for the formation of this active phase. This phase likely comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity observed in this catalyst system. The surface area of the support, metal loading, and carrier type influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the current performance of the system is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium under the tested conditions. Further improvements are needed for it to be ready for industrial use.

          Earlier studies showed that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane but is unstable under the required reaction conditions. In contrast, molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation. The active phase involves molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is necessary for the formation of this active phase, which likely consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is located on the catalyst's uppermost layer. The active phase on the silica-supported catalyst might contain more carbon (carbide-like phase), resulting in a non-selective catalyst.

The efficiency of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation depends significantly on the bulk In/Pt ratio. A peak activity is reached at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, resulting in a PtIn alloy with 12% In. Alloying In with Pt leads to a substantial reduction in carbon accumulation during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Carbon deposition primarily occurs on the support during ethane dehydrogenation, and a portion also accumulates on PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation. Catalyst usage for either reaction resulted in coke deposition, but the addition of In to Pt significantly decreased the coke amount.
