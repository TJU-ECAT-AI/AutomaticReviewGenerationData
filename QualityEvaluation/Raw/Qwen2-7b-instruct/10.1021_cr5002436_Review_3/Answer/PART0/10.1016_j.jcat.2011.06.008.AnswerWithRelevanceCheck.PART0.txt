          "The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."
          "The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios."
          "During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."
          "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

          The efficiency of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation depends significantly on the bulk In/Pt ratio. A peak activity is reached at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, resulting in a PtIn alloy with 12% In. Alloying In with Pt leads to a substantial reduction in carbon accumulation during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Carbon deposition primarily occurs on the support during ethane dehydrogenation, and a portion also accumulates on PtIn nanoparticles during propane dehydrogenation. Catalyst usage for either reaction resulted in coke deposition, but the addition of In to Pt significantly decreased the coke amount.

          Pt/Mg(In)(Al)催化剂用于乙烷和丙烷脱氢的效率依赖于整体In/Pt比例。在0.48的整体In/Pt比下达到峰值活性，形成含12% In的PtIn合金。将In与Pt合金化导致了乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中碳沉积量的大幅减少。在乙烷脱氢过程中，碳主要沉积在支撑物上，而在丙烷脱氢过程中，部分碳也沉积在PtIn纳米颗粒上。使用任何反应的催化剂都观察到了焦炭沉积，但将In添加到Pt中显著减少了焦炭量。

          "Ethylene, propylene, and butene are used extensively to produce rubber, plastics and many other products."
          "While thermal dehydrogenation, like steam cracking, is an endothermic process, it occurs at lower temperatures, 9731073 K, but can also produce methane and coke as byproducts."

          Ethylene, propylene, and butene are widely used in the production of rubber, plastics, and various other products. Thermal dehydrogenation, similar to steam cracking, is an endothermic process occurring at temperatures between 973 and 1073 K. It can also generate methane and coke as secondary products.

          乙烯、丙烯和丁烯广泛用于橡胶、塑料和其他多种产品的生产。热脱氢化类似于蒸汽裂解，是一个吸热过程，在973至1073 K的温度范围内发生。它也可以产生甲烷和焦炭等副产品。
