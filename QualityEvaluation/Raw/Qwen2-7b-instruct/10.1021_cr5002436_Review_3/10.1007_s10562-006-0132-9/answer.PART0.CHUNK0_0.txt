[1] "The activity of the vanadium magnesium binary oxides supported on Cact, SiO2, c-Al2O3 and ZnO in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene under the carbon dioxide or inert gas atmosphere was investigated."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research efforts have focused on optimizing catalyst properties, including carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, to enhance the activity and selectivity of vanadium species. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the activity of the vanadium magnesium binary oxides supported on different carriers like activated carbon (Cact), silica (SiO2), aluminum oxide (c-Al2O3), and zinc oxide (ZnO) was investigated under carbon dioxide or inert gas atmospheres for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. The role of carbon dioxide in this process was determined through additional tests involving the RWGS reaction, gasification of coke, and regeneration of partially reduced catalysts. Furthermore, temperature-programmed techniques like TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and TPD-CO2 were utilized to characterize the catalysts. It was found that, while the one-step pathway of the process cannot be completely excluded, carbon dioxide enhances the dehydrogenation of isobutane over bulk, silica, and activated carbon supported vanadium magnesium oxides by promoting the RWGS reaction and gasification of coke, indicating a dominant role in the two-step pathway.

自1980年代以来，对以范德华氧化物为替代品的催化剂进行的探索已经显著发展起来，用于正构烷烃脱氢。研究工作集中在优化催化剂属性，包括载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载，以增强范德华物种的活性和选择性。变量如载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载在决定这些催化剂中范德华物种的性质和行为方面起着关键作用。例如，对在不同载体（如活性碳（Cact）、硅（SiO2）、铝氧（c-Al2O3）和锌（ZnO））上支持的范德华镁二元氧化物进行了调查，用于在二氧化碳或惰性气体气氛下将异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯。确定了二氧化碳在该过程中的作用，通过额外测试涉及RWGS反应、焦炭气化和部分还原催化剂再生。此外，使用了温度程序技术，如TPR-H2、TPD-NH3和TPD-CO2来表征催化剂。发现尽管单步路径的过程不能完全排除，但二氧化碳通过促进RWGS反应和焦炭气化，增强了由范德华镁氧化物支持的大量、硅和活性碳的异丁烷脱氢，这表明主要作用在于两步路径。
