Activity of vanadium magnesium oxide supported catalysts in the dehydrogenation of isobutane Jan Ogonowski and El_ zbieta Skrzyn ska* Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology, Cracow University of Technology, ul. Warszawska 24, Krako w, 31-155, Poland Received 14 June 2006; accepted 29 June 2006 The activity of the vanadium magnesium binary oxides supported on Cact, SiO2, c-Al2O3 and ZnO in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene under the carbon dioxide or inert gas atmosphere was investigated. The highest isobutene yield (34.8%) was obtained over active carbon supported catalyst. The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process was determined on the basis of additional tests: the RWGS reaction, gasification of coke and regeneration of partially reduced catalysts. The temperature- programmed techniques (TPR-H2, TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2) were used to characterize the catalysts.
KEY WORDS: isobutane dehydrogenation; VMgOx supported catalysts; role of carbon dioxide.
1. Introduction
At present, isobutene is typically obtained by cata- lytic dehydrogenation of isobutane and as a by-product of steam cracking or a fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha. The AAB Lummus Global, the world leader of catalytic dehydrogenation technology, have licensed eight CATOFIN process units, which provide isobu- tylene with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) [1,2]. Dehydrogenation of isobutane is known as an equilibrium and endother- mic reaction (1). iC4H10  iC4H8  H2 DHo 298  117:28 kJ=mol 1 For thermodynamics reasons, significant yield of alkene requires operation at relatively high temperatures what causes high-energy costs. Moreover, such process con- ditions favor undesired thermal cracking reactions to lighter hydrocarbons and leads to rapid catalyst deac- tivation by coke [35].
An alternative to this process is an oxidative dehy- drogenation (ODH) of isobutane by molecular oxygen (2). iC4H10  0:5O2 ! iC4H8  H2O DHo 298  124:68 kJ=mol 2 The ODH gives the following benefits: the reaction is irreversible and exothermic, process can be carried out at lower temperatures and there is no carbon deposition deactivating the catalyst. However, using oxygen as an oxidant of isobutane brings several problems, such as flammability of the reaction mixture, necessity of the heat removal and the presence of deep oxidation reac- tions, which are very hard to control. These side reac- tions lower the process selectivity due to the production of undesired carbon oxides [46]. Therefore, it is expected that replacing oxygen in the oxidative dehy- drogenation reactions by weak oxidants, such as SO2, N2O and CO2, will suppress these disadvantages [710].
Recently, several attempts were made to use carbon dioxide as an unconventional source of oxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane [916]. The overall reaction can be described as follow (3):iC4H10  CO2  iC4H8  CO  H2O DHo 298  158:41 kJ=mol 3 It has to be pointed out that the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide can proceed by two different reaction pathways. The first one is a direct process, shown in the equation 3, where the CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation through reoxidizing the catalyst surface, reduced by isobutane. This one-step pathway is in agreement with the Mars and van Krev- elen mechanism [11,12]. The second one, known as a two-step pathway, is a simple dehydrogenation (equa- tion 1) followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS, equation 4):

Many results indicate that isobutene is formed by both presented mechanisms [11,12]. More- over, in the dehydrogenation process carbon dioxide can *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We found that VMgOx catalyst (V/Mg = 0.11 molar ratio) prepared by citrate method exhibit relatively high activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The pres- ence of carbon dioxide enhanced the alkane conversion [17], as in the case of the active carbon supported vanadium oxide [18]. The opposite trend was observed over VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/ZnO catalysts while silica supported vanadium oxide didnt show considerable sensitivity to the reaction atmosphere [18]. Those experiments brought us the question how much the catalytic performance and the physicochemical proper- ties of the vanadium magnesium oxide catalyst can be changed by loading it on the new mentioned supports.
To find the answer, catalytic tests with isobutane and carbon dioxide were carried out together with the temperature-programmed reduction and desorption analysis.
2. Experimental
The supported VMgOx catalysts with the V/Mg molar ratio of
0.11
were prepared by combined impregnation - citrate method. The supports: Cact, c- Al2O3, SiO2 and ZnO were suspended in a transparent aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate, magne- sium nitrate and citric acid in such amount to yield a nominal 4 wt% of V2O5. Next, the slurry was evapo- rated at 353 K while stirring, and then dried at 373 K for 12 h. Except the active carbon supported catalyst,the solid precursors were calcined in static air at 923 K for 6 h, pressed to thin discs and crushed to form the final bulk catalyst samples (d = 0.20.3 mm). Prior the impregnation the silica gel was dried for 3 h at 180 C to obtain anhydrous silicon dioxide. All the supports were powdered while the activated carbon was crushed to the particles with 0.20.3 mm diameter. The unsupported VMgOx catalyst was prepared by the citrate method [17].
The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was carried out under atmospheric pressure at 873 K. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were placed in a reactor and outgassed in helium for 0.5 h. Then the reactor was fed with iC4H10 and CO2 (or He) in the molar ratio of 1:6 and total flow rate 35 cm3 min)1. In the case of active carbon supported catalyst, the sample was first activated at 923 K in carbon dioxide flow (30 cm3 min)1). After 10 min, the temperature was lowered to 873 K and the sample was degassed for further 10 min in helium. The products formed during the dehydrogenation were analyzed on-line with two gas chromatographs. The details were given elsewhere [16,17].
The specific surface area (BET method) of the cata- lysts was determined at 77 K using nitrogen as the adsorbate. The temperature-programmed studies were carried out in a quartz reactor connected on-line with a thermal conductivity detector. All the samples were pretreated using the same procedure as that used for the catalytic tests. For TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2 experi- ments, the outgassed samples (0.2 g) were cooled to room temperature under dry helium flow and than sat- urated with ammonia or carbon dioxide for 0.5 h (30 cm3 min)1). The unadsorbed gases were flushed out of the reactor by flowing helium (60 cm3 min)1), and finally the temperature was increased to 873 K at the heating rate of 10 K min)1. Desorbed species were analyzed on-line. For the TPR-H2 experiments the cat- alysts were taken in such amounts as to give the samples with 8 mg of V2O5 content. The catalysts were reduced with the mixture of hydrogen and argon (1:9 volume ratio, 30 cm3 min)1) by programming the temperature from room temperature to 900 K at the constant heating rate of 10 K min)1. The maximum temperature was kept unchanged, until the rate of hydrogen consumption returned to the initial value. The TCD peak areas were calibrated by injections of dry, gaseous ammonia, car- bon dioxide and pure argon for TPD and TPR experi- ments respectively. The reduction extent of V species (H2/V)mol and the average formal oxidation number of vanadium after TPR-H2 analysis were calculated [19].
3. Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the isobutane conversion and isobu- tene selectivity as a function of the reaction time at 873 K. The process was carried out both in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide. To minimize the adverse thermal effect and to keep the vanadium content in the samples at the same level of 18 mg V2O5, precisely 0.4 g of the supported catalysts were taken to the catalytic tests. Moreover, the unsupported VMgOx was diluted with glass grains (weight ratio of 1:4) what allowed obtaining the reactor packing with the same vanadium content. To identify the possibility of thermal dehy- drogenation of isobutane over the glass, blank test also has been carried out (0.4 g of glass particles with 0.2
0.3 mm diameter).
For unsupported vanadium magnesium oxide and active carbon supported catalyst after 10 min of the reaction, the isobutane conversion was higher in the presence of carbon dioxide than that under helium atmosphere. However, when the reaction period was increased, the reduction of catalyst activity was lower in the presence of helium. Therefore, the isobutene yield in the CO2 was higher only at the first part of process. Only

ska/Activity of vanadium magnesium oxide supported catalysts 80 in the case of silica supported vanadium magnesium oxide, the isobutane conversion in the carbon dioxide flow was higher than that in helium during the whole experiment. The opposite trend was observed when the dehydrogenation was carried out over VMgOx/Al2O3 and VMgOx/ZnO  then the isobutene yield in helium was higher than that in the presence of carbon dioxide.
Moreover, the catalytic activity of the alumina sup- ported vanadium magnesium oxide gradually increased to a small extent during the first 30 min of the run in helium atmosphere. Thermal dehydrogenation over glass particles gave traces of isobutene (1% yield) in the both atmospheres.
Because of the rapid catalyst deactivation, the most interesting are first minutes of the dehydrogenation process. Data presented in table 1 show initial average results of the isobutane dehydrogenation over the vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts used in this work.
To measure the average conversion and selectivity within first 10 min of the process, the gases at the reactor outlet were collected in separate bottles and then analyzed chromatographically. 70 80 90 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time [min] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time [min] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time [min] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time [min] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time [min] 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time [min] Conversion and selectivity [%] 25 15 35 VMgOx/Cact 45 70 80 90 Conversion and selectivity [%] 25 15 35 45 70 80 90 Conversion and selectivity [%] 25 15 35 45 70 80 90 Conversion and selectivity [%] 25 15 35 45 70 80 90 Conversion and selectivity [%] 25 15 35 45 70 80 90 Conversion and selectivity [%] 25 15 35 45 VMgOx/Al2O3 VMgOx blank test VMgOx/SiO2 VMgOx/ZnO Figure 1.

ska/Activity of vanadium magnesium oxide supported catalysts 81 The main products of the isobutane dehydrogenation were isobutene, propene and methane. There were also small amounts of propane, ethane and ethylene. Only over alumina, silica and active carbon supported cata- lysts traces of n-butenes were detected in the both reaction atmospheres. The selectivity to n-C4 hydrocar- bons was constant during the isobutane dehydrogena- tion,except for the VMgOx/Cact catalyst,where n-butenes disappeared after 0.5 h of reaction. The presence of the isomerization products can be explained by relatively strong acidity of the catalysts (table 2).
This effect is related to the fact that isobutane and larger hydrocarbons have a negative charge on the most reactive hydrogen, what favors their interaction with electrophilic (acidic) surfaces. Nevertheless, electron- donating olefins are more basic than the corresponding paraffins, so their desorption from acidic surfaces is more difficult [20,21]. Strong interaction with the cata- lyst surface may promote further isomerization and degradation of the dehydrogenation products to coke,which was confirmed by our experiments. Except for hydrocarbons, hydrogen, carbon oxide and water were detected. Small amount of CO detected during the iso- butane dehydrogenation in helium could come from interaction of lattice oxygen with the reagents. Forma- tion of atomic oxygen from magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3V2O8), proposed by Burrows et al. [22], proceeds according to the equation (6) with simultaneous reduc- tion of vanadium ions from V+5 to V+3 Mg3V2O8 ! 2MgO  MgV2O4  2O 6 The subsequent reaction of atomic oxygen with H2 shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium. This can explain the small growth of the isobutane conversion, which was observed over alumina supported catalyst during the first 30 min of the process carried out in helium atmo- sphere. For the same reason and the possibility of fur- ther hydrogenolysis, the H2/iC4H8 molar ratio was below one for the dehydrogenation of isobutane in helium over VMgOx/SiO2 catalyst.
In the presence of an oxidizing agent (CO2) the lattice oxygen becomes available for the Mars and van Krev- elen reaction mechanism [11,12], but it is known from the literature that the reversibility of the reaction (6) is very low [22]. Therefore, most of carbon oxide produced during the dehydrogenation in CO2 atmosphere comes from the reverse water gas shift reaction (4) and the gasification of coke (5). To confirm this hypothesis additional tests were carried out.
A stream of CO2 (30 cm3 min)1) was passed through the fresh, coked and partially reduced catalyst at 873 K.
All the products were collected during the first 10 min of each test and analyzed chromatographically. Carbon oxide yields calculated from the tests (i.e., the blank test, the gasification of coke and the reoxidation of vanadium respectively), were compared with the aver- age amount of CO formed in the RWGS reaction (H2:CO2 = 1:6 molar ratio). From the data presented in table 2 it is clearly seen that the highest CO yields were obtained during the reverse water gas shift reac- tion. The blank tests over unsupported VMgOx and supported alumina, silica and zinc oxide catalysts,showed that carbon dioxide does not interact with the vanadium at high oxidation state. Although consider- able amount of CO was formed over freshly activated VMgOx/Cact, we have to take into account the nature of the support, which can interact with the carbon dioxide in the Boudouard reaction (5). Moreover, the TPR-H2 and XRD analysis proved that active carbon supported catalysts contain vanadium oxide at a lower oxidation state [18,23]. Therefore, the carbon dioxide can also participate in reoxidation of the catalyst. Possibility of such reaction was confirmed by the tests with partially reduced catalysts, where measurable amounts of CO were detected.
The nature of the catalyst surface was tested by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2.
As the probe gases were adsorbed at room temperature,the first peak (up to 373 K) should be associated with the physisorbed NH3 and CO2. The higher temperatures maxima can be assigned to desorption of chemisorbed species from the sites of different strength [24]: weak (below 473 K), medium (473573 K) and strong (above 573 K). The amounts of desorbed ammonia and carbon dioxide were calculated from the overall TCD signal areas, calibrated by injections of pure NH3 and CO2.
The percentage of strong acidic (basic) site were deter- mined from the ratio of the TPD area for the particular temperature region, to the TPD area associated with chemisorption (table 3).
The percentage of strong basic sites in VMgOx sup- ported catalysts decreases in the sequence: ZnO > Al2O3 > Cact > VMgOx > SiO2. The same order is observed for the average carbon oxide yields in the reverse water gas shift reaction (table 2). Moreover, the CO/iC4H8 molar ratios obtained for the dehydrogena- tion in carbon dioxide flow (table 1) decrease in similar Table 2 The average CO yields for the reaction of CO2 with hydrogen (RWGS), coke (gasification) and reduced vanadium (reoxidation) in comparison with the blank test (fresh catalyst)* Catalyst The average yield of CO (%) from Blank test Gasification

ska/Activity of vanadium magnesium oxide supported catalysts 82 fashion. Therefore, the high concentration of strong basic centers on the catalyst surface facilitates conver- sion of CO2 (acidic molecule). As carbon dioxide adsorbs at the basic sites, the relative acidity of the catalysts surface increases. Consequently, the selectivity to isobutene decreases, whereas the selectivity to isom- erization and degradation products increases. This conclusion stays in agreement with our experiments,where the isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 gave lower isobutene selectivity than that in helium atmosphere (table 1).
Figure 2 shows the TPR-H2 profiles of the tested VMgOx catalysts. The initial temperature of hydrogen uptake is around 580660 K for all of the catalysts studied. Moreover, its position increases in the same sequence as Tmax  the temperature of maximum hydrogen consumption (table 4). Because of extremely high hydrogen uptake over VMgOx/Cact, the TPR-H2 experiments were done for the non-loaded supports (figure 3).
Only two of the supports show positive TCD signal during the TPR-H2 experiment. ZnO profile shows small hydrogen uptake with the maximum at 673 K, which can be related to some reduction of Zn2+ to zinc metal [25]. On the other hand, very high consumption of hydrogen by activated carbon is caused by the chemical nature of the support. It is well known that activation of carbon with oxidizing acids and heating it in carbon dioxide flow yields various oxygen-containing species on its surface. The most important of them are: carboxylic acids and anhydrides, carboxyl-carbonates, lactones,phenols and quinines [26]. Decomposition of oxygen functional groups on carbon surface upon heating in an inert atmosphere has been the subject of many investi- gations [2628]. It is well established that thermal treatment of activated carbon at 923 K eliminates almost all of the CO2-yielding complexes like carboxylic acids, anhydrides and lactones. Despite that, carbon surface still contains an appreciable amount of phenolic and quinolic groups, which have carbon oxide evolution maxima at 900 and 1100 K respectively [26]. These phenomena were confirmed by simple test, where carbon sample was activated in CO2 flow and outgassed in argon at 923 K. The sample still contained some oxygen groups on the surface, as CO was detected upon further heating of sample at the temperature above 900 K.
Despite that, no methane was detected during the tem- perature-programmed reduction experiment.
Presence of reducible oxygen groups would explain high hydrogen uptake by both activated carbon and carbon-supported VMgOx catalyst. Consequently, the proper hydrogen consumption by vanadium species (table 4) was calculated as the difference between the H2 uptake over VMgOx loaded catalyst and that corre- sponding to the support.
As the hydrogen consumption by VMgOx species was similar for all of the supported catalysts, the average oxidation number (nav) of vanadium was established to Table 3 The catalysts BET surface areas and the results from TPD experiments Catalyst BET (m2/g) NH3 desorption (mmol NH3 /gcat) CO2 desorption (mmol CO2/gcat) Overall NH3/CO2 Total

ska/Activity of vanadium magnesium oxide supported catalysts 83 be around 4. That means that magnesium orthovana- date (Mg3V2O8) is reduced on the catalyst surface mainly to Mg2VO4. Chang et al. [29] proved that reversibility of such reduction is relatively high in the presence of oxygen (7), what is caused by similarity between the structure of both vanadates. 2Mg2VO4  1 2 O2 ! Mg3V2O8  MgO 7 As the transformation between the structures requires only a small shift in oxy gen atom positions [29], there is a great possibility for a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide, to oxidize the catalyst surface. Such reaction explains the presence of carbon oxide among the prod- ucts collected during the CO2 interaction with partially reduced catalyst (table 2).
4. Conclusions
Loading of vanadium magnesium oxide onto SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO and Cact afford new catalysts with different performance in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction.
Large surface area of the supported catalysts is not the crucial parameter deciding about their catalytic activity.
Much more important are both redox and acidbase properties of the catalysts. Low reducibility of the silica supported VMgOx causes low isobutane conversion,while its dominating acidic character decides about low conversion of carbon dioxide. Analogously, low acidity and high concentration of strong basic centers on active carbon, alumina and zinc oxide supported catalysts improves the activation of carbon dioxide.
The performed tests show that isobutane dehydro- genation in carbon dioxide atmosphere over VMgOx catalysts proceed mostly via a two-step pathway. High conversions in the RWGS reaction, especially well seen over alumina and zinc oxide supported catalysts, indi- cate that the main role of CO2 is removing hydrogen from the reaction mixture and releasing the thermody- namic limitation of equilibrium. From the other site, the formation of CO in the experiments carried out over coked and partially reduced catalysts indicates that carbon dioxide shows some activity in the catalyst reoxidation and coke gasification reactions at 873 K.
Moreover, low activity of the bulk, silica and active carbon supported VMgOx in RWGS reaction, together with promoting effect of CO2 in the isobutane dehy- drogenation, indicate that one-step pathway of the process cannot be completely excluded. In comparison to Al2O3 and ZnO supported samples, the other VMgOx catalysts are also characterized by slightly higher tem- perature of maximum hydrogen consumption and lower content of strong acid and basic sites.
