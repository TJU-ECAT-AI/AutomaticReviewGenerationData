[1] "At present, isobutene is typically obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane and as a by-product of steam cracking or a fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha."
[2] "Dehydrogenation of isobutane is known as an equilibrium and endothermic reaction (1)."
[3] "The overall reaction can be described as follow (3):iC4H10  CO2  iC4H8  CO  H2O DHo 298  158:41 kJ=mol"
[4] "Many results indicate that isobutene is formed by both presented mechanisms [11,12]."
[5] "Low reducibility of the silica supported VMgOx causes low isobutane conversion,while its dominating acidic character decides about low conversion of carbon dioxide."
[6] "An alternative to this process is an oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of isobutane by molecular oxygen (2)."
[7] "However, using oxygen as an oxidant of isobutane brings several problems, such as flammability of the reaction mixture, necessity of the heat removal and the presence of deep oxidation reactions, which are very hard to control."
[8] "Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process carbon dioxide can act as a diluent, it delivers the required heat and reduces coking of catalyst by the coke gasification [1015]: Ccoke  CO2  2CO DHo 298  172:42 kJ=mol"
[9] "The main products of the isobutane dehydrogenation were isobutene, propene and methane. There were also small amounts of propane, ethane and ethylene."
[10] "For the same reason and the possibility of further hydrogenolysis, the H2/iC4H8 molar ratio was below one for the dehydrogenation of isobutane in helium over VMgOx/SiO2 catalyst."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for cost-effective and efficient catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has focused on understanding the role of different variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Silica-supported vanadium magnesium oxide (VMgOx) exhibits low isobutane conversion due to its low reducibility and acidic character, which limits the conversion of carbon dioxide. Conversely, active carbon, alumina, and zinc oxide supported catalysts show improved performance due to their acidic character, which enhances the conversion of carbon dioxide. The two-step pathway is predominant in the dehydrogenation of isobutane in carbon dioxide atmosphere, where carbon dioxide removes hydrogen from the reaction mixture and releases the thermodynamic limitation of equilibrium. The one-step pathway cannot be completely excluded, as indicated by the high activity of the catalysts in the RWGS reaction and the promoting effect of carbon dioxide in the isobutane dehydrogenation.

对于正烷烃脱氢，使用范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品进行探索，主要是为了寻找成本效益高且高效的催化剂。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究集中在理解不同变量如载体类型、支持面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的影响。由于其低还原性和酸性特征，二氧化硅支持的VMgOx表现出较低的异丁烷转化率。相反，活性碳、氧化铝和锌氧化物支持的催化剂因其酸性特征而表现出更好的性能，这能促进二氧化碳的转化。在二氧化碳气氛下的异丁烷脱氢过程中，主要存在两步路径，其中二氧化碳从反应混合物中移除氢并释放热力学平衡限制。一步路径不能完全排除，这从催化剂在水煤气变换反应中的高活性以及二氧化碳在异丁烷脱氢过程中的促进作用中可以看出。
