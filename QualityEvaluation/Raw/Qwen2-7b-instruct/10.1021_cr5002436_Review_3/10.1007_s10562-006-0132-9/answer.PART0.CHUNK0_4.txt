[1] "At present, isobutene is typically obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane and as a by-product of steam cracking or a fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha."
[2] "Dehydrogenation of isobutane is known as an equilibrium and endothermic reaction."
[3] "The overall reaction can be described as follow (3):iC4H10  CO2  iC4H8  CO  H2O"
[4] "Many results indicate that isobutene is formed by both presented mechanisms."
[5] "To find the answer, catalytic tests with isobutane and carbon dioxide were carried out together with the temperature-programmed reduction and desorption analysis."
[6] "For TPD-NH3 and TPD-CO2 experiments, the outgassed samples (0.2 g) were cooled to room temperature under dry helium flow and than saturated with ammonia or carbon dioxide for 0.5 h (30 cm3 min)1)."
[7] "The details were given elsewhere [16,17]."
[8] "Moreover, the catalysts were placed in a reactor and outgassed in helium for 0.5 h."
[9] "The products formed during the dehydrogenation were analyzed on-line with two gas chromatographs."
[10] "The specific surface area (BET method) of the cata- lysts was determined at 77 K using nitrogen as the adsorbate."
[11] "The temperature-programmed studies were carried out in a quartz reactor connected on-line with a thermal conductivity detector."
[12] "For TPD and TPR experi- ments respectively."
[13] "The reduction extent of V species (H2/V)mol and the average formal oxidation number of vanadium after TPR-H2 analysis were calculated."
[14] "Data presented in table 1 show initial average results of the isobutane dehydrogenation over the vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts used in this work."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire for catalysts that are more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and potentially more efficient. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts through various modifications such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.

2. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts by affecting the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts. Carrier type can alter the distribution and accessibility of the vanadium species, while support surface area impacts the interaction of the catalyst with reactants and products. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium in the catalyst, which in turn affects the redox and acid-base properties that are crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction.

1. 使用范德华氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品进行烷烃脱氢的探索，主要是出于对更经济、环境友好且可能更高效的催化剂的需求。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究已经显著发展，重点是通过修改载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载等方法优化这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。

2. 载体类型、支持表面积和金属负载等因素影响着范德华氧化物基催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，这会改变催化剂的物理和化学属性。载体类型可以改变物种的分布和可接近性，而支持表面积会影响催化剂与反应物和产物的相互作用。金属负载决定了催化剂中钒的浓度，从而影响其还原性和酸碱性质，这些都是脱氢反应所必需的。
