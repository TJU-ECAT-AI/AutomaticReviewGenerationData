The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research efforts have focused on optimizing catalyst properties, including carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, to enhance the activity and selectivity of vanadium species. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For instance, the activity of the vanadium magnesium binary oxides supported on different carriers like activated carbon (Cact), silica (SiO2), aluminum oxide (c-Al2O3), and zinc oxide (ZnO) was investigated under carbon dioxide or inert gas atmospheres for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. The role of carbon dioxide in this process was determined through additional tests involving the RWGS reaction, gasification of coke, and regeneration of partially reduced catalysts. Furthermore, temperature-programmed techniques like TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and TPD-CO2 were utilized to characterize the catalysts. It was found that, while the one-step pathway of the process cannot be completely excluded, carbon dioxide enhances the dehydrogenation of isobutane over bulk, silica, and activated carbon supported vanadium magnesium oxides by promoting the RWGS reaction and gasification of coke, indicating a dominant role in the two-step pathway.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find cost-effective, sustainable, and potentially more selective catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on the development of novel catalyst compositions, modifications to existing ones, and the optimization of operational conditions. The behavior and nature of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by various factors, including the type of carrier (support material), the surface area of the support, and the metal loading.

Different carriers such as silica, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, and activated carbon, along with varying metal loadings, can alter the redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts, impacting their activity and selectivity. Large surface areas of the supported catalysts, though seemingly important, are not the sole determinant of catalytic activity. Instead, the redox and acid-base characteristics of the catalysts play crucial roles in the dehydrogenation process. For instance, the low reducibility of silica-supported vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts leads to lower isobutane conversion, while its acidic character influences the conversion of carbon dioxide.

In the context of carbon dioxide (CO2) usage, it acts as a diluent, delivering required heat and reducing catalyst coking through the gasification of coke. In the dehydrogenation process, CO2 can participate in multiple pathways, primarily through a two-step mechanism where it removes hydrogen from the reaction system, releasing the thermodynamic limitation of equilibrium. The role of CO2 in the reaction is further highlighted by its ability to suppress undesired reactions, such as the formation of carbon oxides, and to promote the reoxidation of catalysts and the gasification of coke.

Research findings suggest that the one-step pathway of the dehydrogenation process cannot be completely ruled out, even when considering the significant role of CO2 in facilitating a two-step pathway. The complex interplay between CO2 and the catalyst surface, along with the dynamic nature of vanadium species, underscores the multifaceted approach needed to optimize vanadium oxide-based catalysts for efficient paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

对范德华氧化物基催化剂作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)等烷基化脱氢的替代品的研究，主要是为了寻找成本效益高、可持续且可能更选择性的催化剂。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，着重于新型催化剂成分的开发、现有催化剂的改良以及操作条件的优化。在这些催化剂中，范德华物种的行为和性质受到多种因素的影响，包括载体（支持材料）的类型、支持材料的表面积和金属负载量。

不同的载体，如硅胶、铝氧、锌氧和活性碳，以及不同的金属负载量，可以改变催化剂的还原性和酸碱性，影响其活性和选择性。尽管大表面积的支撑催化剂看似重要，但它们并非决定催化活性的唯一因素。相反，催化剂的还原性和酸碱特性对于脱氢过程至关重要。例如，硅胶支持的范德华镁氧化物催化剂的低可还原性导致较低的异丁烷转化率，而其酸性特征则影响二氧化碳的转化。

在二氧化碳（CO2）使用方面，它作为一种稀释剂，提供必要的热量并通过焦炭气化减少催化剂积碳。在脱氢过程中，CO2可以参与多个途径，主要通过两步机制，其中它从反应系统中去除氢，释放热力学平衡的限制。CO2在反应中的作用进一步体现在其抑制不希望的反应，如碳氧化物的形成，并促进催化剂再氧化和焦炭气化的能力。

研究结果表明，单步路径过程不能完全排除，即使考虑到CO2在促进两步路径过程中的重要作用。CO2与催化剂表面之间的复杂相互作用，以及范德华物种的动态性质，强调了优化范德华氧化物基催化剂以实现高效烷基化脱氢过程所需采取的综合方法。
