[1] "At present, isobutene is typically obtained by cata- lytic dehydrogenation of isobutane and as a by-product of steam cracking or a fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha."
[2] "Dehydrogenation of isobutane is known as an equilibrium and endothermic reaction (1). iC4H10  iC4H8  H2 DHo 298  117:28 kJ=mol 1"
[3] "Moreover, such process conditions favor undesired thermal cracking reactions to lighter hydrocarbons and leads to rapid catalyst deac- tivation by coke [35]."
[4] "However, using oxygen as an oxidant of isobutane brings several problems, such as flammability of the reaction mixture, necessity of the heat removal and the presence of deep oxidation reac- tions, which are very hard to control."
[5] "Recently, several attempts were made to use carbon dioxide as an unconventional source of oxygen in the oxidative dehy- drogenation of isobutane [916]."
[6] "In this case CO2 removes hydrogen from the reaction system and releases the thermodynamic limitation of equilibrium [4]."
[7] "We found that VMgOx catalyst (V/Mg = 0.11 molar ratio) prepared by citrate method exhibit relatively high activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane."
[8] "Moreover, the catalytic activity of the alumina sup- ported vanadium magnesium oxide gradually increased to a small extent during the first 30 min of the run in helium atmosphere."
[9] "Data presented in table 1 show initial average results of the isobutane dehydrogenation over the vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts used in this work."
[10] "Table 3 The catalysts BET surface areas and the results from TPD experiments"
[11] "Low reducibility of the silica supported VMgOx causes low isobutane conversion,while its dominating acidic character decides about low conversion of carbon dioxide."
[12] "The performed tests show that isobutane dehydro- genation in carbon dioxide atmosphere over VMgOx catalysts proceed mostly via a two-step pathway."
[13] "Moreover, low activity of the bulk, silica and active carbon supported VMgOx in RWGS reaction, together with promoting effect of CO2 in the isobutane dehy- drogenation, indicate that one-step pathway of the process cannot be completely excluded."
[14] "In comparison to Al2O3 and ZnO supported samples, the other VMgOx catalysts are also characterized by slightly higher tem- perature of maximum hydrogen consumption and lower content of strong acid and basic sites."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxides for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to find more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on the development of new catalyst compositions and optimization of reaction conditions. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play critical roles in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts.

2. The catalytic activity of vanadium magnesium oxide (VMgOx) catalysts, particularly those prepared by the citrate method, exhibits relatively high activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The presence of carbon dioxide enhances the alkane conversion, as evidenced by experiments with active carbon-supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

3. The activity of the alumina-supported vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts increases slightly during the first 30 minutes of the reaction in a helium atmosphere, indicating that the catalyst's performance can be influenced by the reaction conditions.

4. Initial average results of isobutane dehydrogenation over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts demonstrate varying degrees of conversion and selectivity depending on the support material used.

5. The catalysts' BET surface areas and results from temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments provide insights into the surface properties of the vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts, including their acidity and basicity characteristics.

6. Silica-supported VMgOx catalysts exhibit low isobutane conversion due to their high reducibility and dominant acidic character, which limits the conversion of carbon dioxide.

7. The isobutane dehydrogenation process over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts in carbon dioxide atmosphere primarily follows a two-step pathway, where carbon dioxide plays a role in removing hydrogen from the reaction system and releasing the thermodynamic limitation of equilibrium.

8. The bulk, silica, and active carbon-supported VMgOx catalysts show low activity in the water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, suggesting that they may not efficiently convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, while promoting isobutane dehydrogenation.

9. The VMgOx catalysts differ in their maximum hydrogen consumption temperature and the content of strong acid and basic sites, which influences their performance in both RWGS and isobutane dehydrogenation reactions.

10. Vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts with different support materials (silica, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, and activated carbon) exhibit distinct catalytic performances in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction, with alumina-supported catalysts showing improved performance in RWGS and isobutane dehydrogenation processes compared to silica and carbon-supported catalysts.
