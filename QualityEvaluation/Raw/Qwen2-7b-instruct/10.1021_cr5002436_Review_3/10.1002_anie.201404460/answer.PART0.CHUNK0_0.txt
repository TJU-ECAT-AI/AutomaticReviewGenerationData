Platinum-Promoted Ga/Al2O3 as Highly Active, Selective, and Stable Catalyst for the Dehydrogenation of Propane

Abstract A novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane is presented. The catalyst consists of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina. We observed a synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst. Additionally, we propose a bifunctional active phase, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and where Pt functions as a promoter.

Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on-purpose production of propene.

A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element. This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element.

Table 1 and Figure1 can be concluded that the catalytic conversion varies strongly between the different catalyst materials. In case of the catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, this value is close to the equilibrium conversion (which is ca. 55% at 620C and 1atm pressure) for the first dehydrogenation cycle. When Pt is absent, the conversion is roughly halved, while the absence of Ga results in an even greater drop in conversion. At the same time, the selectivity is high for all catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, but decreases for the materials containing only Pt or Ga. This implies a synergy between Pt and Ga that results in a highly active and selective catalyst.

Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts. Indeed, a slight increase is observed in propene selectivity after addition of K to the Pt and Ga containing catalysts.

Finally, the bare support displays a very low activity and selectivity and is therefore regarded to be inactive.

For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga.

In addition to the catalytic tests discussed in Figure1 and Table1, a long-term stability test consisting of approximately 150 cycles or 14 days of operation, was performed on the very active Pt3GaK catalyst. The catalytic performance of the catalyst during this experiment is shown in Figure2. It was found that the PDH activity drops significantly during the first two days of testing, after which the catalyst performance remained stable during a twelve-day evaluation period, giving a propane conversion of 31.1% and a selectivity for propene of 92.6%, stressing the high stability of the catalyst material.

Operando Raman and UV/Vis spectra have been collected during the catalytic dehydrogenation experiments and the results are summarized in Table1. From the UV/Vis spectra (FigureS4), it is concluded that the absorption increases during the first minutes on stream for the PtGaK catalyst, after which the spectra do not change anymore.

In Figure3, the operando Raman spectra obtained at the end of the eighth propane dehydrogenation cycle are shown for the different investigated catalysts. Two Raman bands typical of coke are observed: the so-called D (disordered, at 1320cm−1) and G-band (graphitic coke, at 1590cm−1).

After the eighth cycle, the catalyst materials were not regenerated, but instead collected from the reactor and analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with on-line mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the coke deposits formed. The change of weight per temperature interval as a function of temperature is shown in FigureS5. In addition, during the combustion a distinct CO2 profile is observed for each catalyst by on-line MS analysis, which is shown in FigureS6.

The specific nature of the gallium species present on the catalyst was investigated by collecting 71Ga MAS NMR (magic-angle spinning NMR) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra of the fresh Pt3Ga and 3Ga catalysts (Figure4, FigureS7, and Table2).

Because metallic Ga is a liquid and Ga2O a volatile compound, it is important to consider the reducibility of Ga3+, especially because the dehydrogenation reaction is performed at high temperatures in a reducing atmosphere.

CO chemisorption was used to study the effect of elevated temperatures on the Pt dispersion in reducing or oxidizing environments.

Finally, the Pt3GaK catalyst was compared with a wide range of other catalyst materials reported in literature, as well as a commercial CrOx catalyst (FigureS11).

In summary, different Pt-Ga-K-containing catalyst materials have been examined for the selective dehydrogenation of propane into propene and it was found that the combination of 1000ppm Pt and 1.53wt% Ga results in a highly active and selective catalyst. The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times.

1. The research on platinum-promoted Ga/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation has been driven by the growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on-purpose production of propene from shale gas deposits. The synergy between platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) in these catalysts leads to a highly active and stable catalyst with Ga acting as the active dehydrogenation element and Pt functioning as a promoter. The addition of potassium (K) as an alkali metal dopant increases propene selectivity and decreases coke deposition by poisoning Brnsted acid sites present in PDH catalysts. 

2. The catalytic performance of the catalyst materials under investigation varies significantly, with the Pt and Ga containing catalysts achieving high conversion rates close to the equilibrium conversion (around 55% at 620°C and 1 atm pressure) for the first dehydrogenation cycle. The absence of Pt halves the conversion rate, while the absence of Ga results in an even greater drop in conversion. The selectivity is high for catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, decreasing for materials containing only Pt or Ga. This synergy between Pt and Ga results in a highly active and selective catalyst. 

3. The long-term stability test on the Pt3GaK catalyst shows that the PDH activity drops significantly during the first two days of testing, but the catalyst performance remains stable for the next twelve days, with a propane conversion of 31.1% and a selectivity for propene of 92.6%. This highlights the high stability of the catalyst material.

4. The operando Raman and UV/Vis spectra collected during the catalytic dehydrogenation experiments indicate that the absorption increases for the PtGaK catalyst during the first minutes on stream, after which the spectra remain unchanged. The presence of potassium (K) results in less darkening of the catalyst material, indicating less coke deposition. 

5. The operando Raman spectra of the different catalysts show two Raman bands typical of coke: the D band (disordered, at 1320 cm−1) and the G-band (graphitic coke, at 1590 cm−1). The presence of Pt significantly affects the D/G ratio, with catalysts containing Pt having a lower D/G ratio compared to those without Pt, suggesting that Pt further dehydrogenates carbon deposits, leading to a higher graphitic portion in the coke. 

6. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with online mass spectrometry (MS) of the catalyst materials after the eighth cycle reveals that the Pt-containing catalysts have lower coke deposition compared to non-Pt-containing catalysts. This is attributed to the presence of potassium (K) which poisons Brnsted acid sites, inhibiting the formation of coke.

7. The gallium species present on the catalyst is found to be primarily in the form of tetrahedrally (IV) and octahedrally (VI) coordinated Ga3+. The presence of Pt results in a higher concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, although this alone cannot explain the high activity of the Pt3Ga catalyst. It is proposed that coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are responsible for the activation of the CH bond, with Pt assisting in the recombination of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle.

8. The Pt3GaK catalyst outperforms a wide range of other catalyst materials reported in literature, including a commercial chromium oxide (CrOx) catalyst, in terms of propylene yield when compared with the weight hourly space velocity.

1. 针对来自页岩气沉积物的大量较重烷烃，如丙烷，探索和生产美国的石油和天然气，已经导致其能源竞争力反弹。目前，美国处于近25年来最低的原油进口水平。虽然页岩盆地的石油产量大幅增加，但天然气产量甚至增长更多，能源信息署预测到2040年，美国国内天然气产量的50%将来自页岩。由于世界各地都发现了页岩层，这些新的氢碳源可能会对全球天然气供应产生影响。据估计，全球有207万亿立方米可技术回收的页岩气。中国估计拥有全球最大的页岩气储备，为32万亿立方米。虽然美国之外的大多数页岩气尚未进行生产，但预计这些低成本化学品和燃料生产原料将在全球范围内变得可用。

2. 大量更重的正构烷烃，如丙烷，从页岩气沉积物中获得，这激发了利用丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯的原位生产提供兴趣。在这一背景下，已经宣布在美国新建5个PDH单元，在中国可能建设9至17个PDH单元。大多数项目基于两种主要的现有PDH技术；即UOP的Oleflex流程和CB&I Lummus的CATOFIN流程。尽管对这两种技术的催化剂材料（Pt-Sn/Al2O3用于Oleflex和Cr/Al2O3用于CATOFIN）和过程条件进行了重大改进，但在活性、稳定性和选择性方面仍需要克服挑战。

3. 在这种背景下，我们提出了一种新型非常稳定、活性高且选择性强的催化剂材料，用于丙烷脱氢到丙烯，基于铂镓/氧化铝。一些已发表的论文中，铂和镓被结合以产生PDH催化剂，但在这些系统中，镓被视为促进元素，而铂是脱氢元素。我们的催化剂与之相反，铂含量极低，镓是脱氢元素。观察到铂和镓之间存在协同效应，导致一种非常稳定的催化剂材料，具有很强的抗失活能力，例如由焦炭导致的失活。

4. 为了进行系统研究，准备了九种催化剂材料，通过沉积1000ppm铂、1.5或3重量%镓和0.25重量%钾在氧化铝支持上。详细的关键参数（X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜能量色散X射线光谱（TEM-EDX）和N2物理吸附）在补充信息（图S1和S2，表S1）中给出。从这些表征数据中可以得出结论，所有化合物都在催化剂材料上均相且高度分散，没有发现结晶纳米颗粒的证据。

5. 准备的材料在实验室规模的反应器中进行了测试，每次循环包括15分钟的PDH步骤，在620°C下，随后在750°C下用空气处理30分钟。反应器在这些步骤之间用氦气冲洗。生成的气体流由气相色谱法分析（补充信息中描述）。设置还允许使用原位Raman和紫外/可见光谱法跟踪催化剂材料上的焦炭沉积。表1总结了前八次PDH周期中准备的每种催化剂材料的活动性和选择性数据。图1显示了在每八次PDH周期中，Al2O3支持、铂、3Ga、Pt3Ga和Pt3GaK催化剂材料的丙烷转化率（X，绿色）和丙烯选择性（S，蓝色）比较。

6. 第八周期结束时，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性在所有催化剂材料中都有所下降。显然，铂和镓两者都是必不可少的，以获得高度活性、选择性和稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂。

7. 表1和图1可以得出结论，催化转化率在不同催化剂材料之间变化很大。在包含铂和镓的催化剂中，这个值接近620°C和1大气压下的平衡转化率（约为55%）。当铂不存在时，转化率大致减半，而仅含镓的材料的转化率则下降更大。同时，所有包含铂和镓的催化剂的选择性都很高，但对于仅含铂或镓的材料，选择性有所降低。这表明铂和镓之间存在协同作用，导致高度活性和选择性的催化剂。

8. 碱金属掺杂剂，如钾，已知可以提高丙烯选择性并减少焦炭沉积，通过毒化PDH催化剂上的Brnsted酸中心。确实，在铂和镓包含的催化剂中添加钾后，丙烯选择性略有增加。

9. 作为活性催化剂的基础，未掺杂的支撑材料显示出非常低的活性和选择性，并被认为是无活性的。在第一个PDH周期之后，转化率和选择率没有下降，验证了催化剂没有被失活。实际上，对于GaK、Ga、和3Ga催化剂，丙烷转化率甚至增加了。这表明这些催化剂需要一个激活期，与暴露于氧气的高温有关。确实，通过在第一次丙烷脱氢周期之前，用氧气在750°C下预处理催化剂，转化率从14.7%增加到20.5%。在620°C下，用空气预处理催化剂，然后进行反应，对转化率的影响较小，第一次丙烷脱氢周期的转化率仅为18.5%。显然，高温再生期间需要高温度。

10. 对于第八次循环，所有催化剂的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性都有所下降。失活程度最小的是包含铂和镓的催化剂。众所周知，基于铂的脱氢催化剂由于金属纳米粒子的聚集而失活，这是一种在脱氢反应条件下被激发的效果。因此，即使在本研究中执行的脱氢和氧化是在相对较高温度下进行的，也没有观察到铂镓催化剂的失活：这些材料继续超越仅含镓的材料，表现出更高的性能，这表明它们之间的协同作用仍然存在。

11. 此外，进行了大约150次循环或14天操作的长期稳定性测试，测试了非常活跃的Pt3GaK催化剂。实验中催化剂的催化性能如图2所示。发现PDH活性在测试的前两天显著下降，之后催化剂性能在接下来的十二天评估期内保持稳定，给定的丙烷转化率为31.1%，丙烯选择性为92.6%，强调了催化剂材料的高稳定性。

12. 运行第八个丙烷脱氢周期时，收集了不同催化剂材料的操作中获得的原位拉曼和紫外/可见光谱，并总结在表1中。根据紫外/可见光谱（图S4），可以得出结论，在最初的几分钟内，PtGaK催化剂的吸收增加，之后谱图不再改变。

13. 图3中显示了第八个丙烷脱氢周期结束时不同研究催化剂的原位拉曼谱。典型的焦炭两个拉曼带被观察到：所谓的D带（无序，位于1320cm−1）和G带（石墨状焦炭，位于1590cm−1）。

14. 在第八个循环结束后，催化剂材料没有再生，而是从反应器中收集并使用热重分析（TGA）结合在线质谱（MS）来研究形成的焦炭沉积物。温度间隔相对于温度的变化图如图S5所示。此外，在燃烧过程中，每个催化剂上都观察到了特定的CO2轮廓，如图S6所示。这些轮廓准确地描述了焦炭燃烧的温度，其对应的温度区间是300至650°C；该温度区间的质量损失包括在表1中。检测到的CO2量非常少，对于仅含铂、未掺杂的支撑材料和含钾的催化剂，这意味着这些催化剂表面上沉积的焦炭较少，这与使用原位UV/Vis光谱法观察到的情况一致。

15. 特定的镓物种的存在被研究通过收集新鲜的Pt3Ga和3Ga催化剂的71Ga MAS NMR（魔角旋转NMR）和XPS（X射线光电子能谱）谱（图4、图S7和表2）。

16. 由于镓是一种液体，镓2O是一种挥发性化合物，考虑镓3+的还原性非常重要，尤其是在高温度和还原气氛下执行脱氢反应的情况下。

17. 使用CO化学吸附研究了在还原或氧化环境中，铂的分布随温度升高的影响。

18. 最后，将Pt3GaK催化剂与文献中报道的多种其他催化剂材料以及商业铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂进行了比较（图S11）。

19. 总结起来，检查了含有铂-镓-钾的几种不同催化剂材料用于丙烷选择性脱氢到丙烯，发现1000ppm铂和1.53重量%镓的组合导致高度活性和选择性强的催化剂。催化剂对焦炭的抵抗力很强，能够长时间保持活性。
