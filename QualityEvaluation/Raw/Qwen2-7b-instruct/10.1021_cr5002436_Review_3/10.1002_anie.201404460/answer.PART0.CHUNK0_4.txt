[1] "While oil production has greatly increased in these shale plays, natural gas has increased even more significantly, with the Energy Information Agency projecting that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas production within the USA will come from shale."
[2] "Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on purpose production of propene."
[3] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."
[4] "The synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."
[5] "A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as promoter."
[6] "From Table1 and Figure1, it can be concluded that the catalytic conversion varies strongly between the different catalyst materials. In case of the catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, this value is close to the equilibrium conversion (which is ca. 55% at 620C and 1atm pressure) for the first dehydrogenation cycle."
[7] "For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga."

The exploration and production of hydrocarbons from shale basins have driven the interest in propane dehydrogenation technologies. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on catalyst materials capable of converting propane to propene efficiently. Factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The synergy between platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) in the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst material results in a highly active and stable system, resistant to deactivation. Gallium acts as the active dehydrogenation element, while platinum serves as a promoter. The conversion efficiency varies among different catalyst materials, but the PtGa system maintains high levels of activity and selectivity across multiple cycles.

从页岩盆地的石油和天然气开采活动推动了丙烷脱氢技术的研究兴趣。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，专注于开发能够高效将丙烷转化为丙烯的催化剂材料。载体类型、支撑表面积以及金属负载等变量对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为产生影响。铂（Pt）和镓（Ga）在PtGa/Al2O3催化剂材料中的协同作用导致了一个高度活性且稳定的系统，该系统能够抵抗失活。镓作为脱氢作用的活性元素，而铂则作为促进剂发挥作用。不同催化剂材料的转化效率存在差异，但PtGa体系在整个循环周期内都能保持高活性和选择性。
