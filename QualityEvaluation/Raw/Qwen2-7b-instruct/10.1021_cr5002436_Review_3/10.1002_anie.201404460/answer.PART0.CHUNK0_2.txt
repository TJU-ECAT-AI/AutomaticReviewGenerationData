[1] "The recent exploration and production of hydrocarbons from shale basins in the USA such as in Barnett, Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford, has led to a rebound in its energy competitiveness."
[2] "Currently, the USA is at the lowest level of crude oil imports in 25years."
[3] "While oil production has greatly increased in these shale plays, natural gas has increased even more significantly, with the Energy Information Agency projecting that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas production within the USA will come from shale."
[4] "These developments will without a doubt impose significant technical and economic challenges and opportunities on the chemical industry as a whole."
[5] "Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17PDH units may be built in China."
[6] "Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome."
[7] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."
[8] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element."
[9] "This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element."
[10] "A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."
[11] "It was found that the PDH activity drops significantly during the first two days of testing, after which the catalyst performance remained stable during a twelve-day evaluation period, giving a propane conversion of 31.1% and a selectivity for propene of 92.6%, stressing the high stability of the catalyst material."
