The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by advancements in technology and a growing demand for efficient and cost-effective processes in the petrochemical industry. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with studies focusing on optimizing various parameters such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to enhance the performance of vanadium-based catalysts. These catalysts are particularly valuable due to their ability to efficiently convert paraffins into olefins, such as propene from propane, which is crucial for the production of numerous chemical products. The synergy between gallium (Ga) and platinum (Pt) in the catalyst material leads to a highly active and stable catalyst, capable of resisting deactivation and maintaining high efficiency over prolonged reaction times. Moreover, the stability of the mixed AlGa oxide prevents its reduction, ensuring the regeneration of active sites and continuous catalyst performance.
