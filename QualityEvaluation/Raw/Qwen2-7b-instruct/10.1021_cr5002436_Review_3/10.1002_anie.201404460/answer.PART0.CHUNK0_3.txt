[1] "Currently, the USA is at the lowest level of crude oil imports in 25years."
[2] "While oil production has greatly increased in these shale plays, natural gas has increased even more significantly, with the Energy Information Agency projecting that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas production within the USA will come from shale."
[3] "A recent study estimates that there are 207trillion cubic meters of technically recoverable shale gas globally. China is estimated to have the worlds largest reserves in shale at 32trillion cubic meters."
[4] "Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome."
[5] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element."
[6] "Evidently, both Pt and Ga are required to obtain a highly active selective and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[7] "From Table1 and Figure1, it can be concluded that the catalytic conversion varies strongly between the different catalyst materials. In case of the catalysts containing both Pt and Ga, this value is close to the equilibrium conversion (which is ca. 55% at 620C and 1atm pressure) for the first dehydrogenation cycle."
[8] "In fact, for the GaK, Ga, and 3Ga catalysts, the propane conversion even increases. This implies that these catalysts require an activation period, related to the exposure to oxygen at 750C."
[9] "Finally, the bare support displays a very low activity and selectivity and is therefore regarded to be inactive."
[10] "For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga."
[11] "Interestingly, the presence of Pt in the catalyst material has a significant effect on the D/G ratio. In Figure3 the lighter colored spectra represent the coke formed on Pt-containing catalysts; the darker colored spectra of their non-Pt-containing counterparts."
[12] "On the contrary, the apparent concentration of Pt is high on the surface (1.3wt% observed versus 1000ppm), suggesting that the Pt is well dispersed on the surface."
[13] "Nevertheless, such a relatively small increase in active sites cannot account for the high activity observed for the Pt3Ga catalyst, compared to 3Ga."
[14] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."
[15] "When comparing the propylene yield with the weight hourly space velocity, the Pt3GaK catalyst displays a superior activity, further highlighting the excellent catalytic performance of the material."

1. The exploration and production of hydrocarbons from shale basins in the USA, particularly in areas like the Barnett, Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford, have significantly increased, leading to a decrease in crude oil imports to the lowest level in 25 years. Natural gas production has surpassed oil production, with projections indicating that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas produced in the USA will come from shale formations. These developments have global implications, as shale gas is found in abundance worldwide, with China having the largest estimated reserves.

2. Research on catalyst materials for paraffin dehydrogenation has seen substantial improvements in materials such as Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN. However, challenges remain in enhancing their activity, stability, and selectivity.

3. In studies combining Pt and Ga for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), Ga is often considered a promoter element rather than the active dehydrogenation component. The synergy between Pt and Ga in the current catalyst results in a highly active and stable catalyst.

4. The catalytic conversion varies significantly among different catalyst materials. Catalysts containing both Pt and Ga exhibit high conversion rates close to equilibrium conversion, demonstrating a synergistic effect.

5. The presence of both Pt and Ga is essential for achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Catalysts lacking either element show significantly lower conversion rates.

6. Catalysts containing Ga require an activation period after exposure to oxygen at 750°C, which enhances their activity. The bare support catalyst is inactive, highlighting the importance of metal incorporation.

7. The eighth cycle of the dehydrogenation process leads to a drop in propane conversion and propene selectivity across all catalysts. Catalysts containing both Pt and Ga experience the least severe deactivation.

8. The D/G ratio in the Raman spectra provides insights into the nature of coke deposits on the catalyst surface. Pt-containing catalysts exhibit a lower D/G ratio, suggesting a higher proportion of graphitic coke.

9. The surface composition analysis reveals that the concentration of Ga on the catalyst surface is slightly higher in Pt3Ga compared to 3Ga catalysts, indicating the influence of Pt on the distribution of Ga species.

10. The reducibility of Ga3+ in the catalyst is confirmed by TPR and XPS experiments, demonstrating that the mixed GaAl oxide is too stable to be reduced under standard conditions.

11. The Pt dispersion does not correlate with the activity of the catalyst, indicating that Pt is not the primary active site for PDH reactions. Instead, coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are responsible for the activation of CH bonds.

12. The Pt3GaK catalyst outperforms other catalyst materials in terms of propylene yield when compared to the weight hourly space velocity, showcasing its superior catalytic performance.

1. 美国从页岩盆地开采的石油和天然气产量大幅增长，导致过去25年来美国的原油进口量降至最低水平。天然气产量超过了原油产量，能源信息署预测到2040年，美国50%的天然气生产将来自页岩。这些发展在全球范围内具有重要影响，因为页岩气在世界各地储量丰富，其中中国拥有最大的页岩气储量。

2. 对于烷烃脱氢反应的催化剂材料研究，已对铂锡/氧化铝（Oleflex）和铬/氧化铝（CATOFIN）等材料进行了显著改进，但仍然需要解决活性、稳定性和选择性方面的挑战。
