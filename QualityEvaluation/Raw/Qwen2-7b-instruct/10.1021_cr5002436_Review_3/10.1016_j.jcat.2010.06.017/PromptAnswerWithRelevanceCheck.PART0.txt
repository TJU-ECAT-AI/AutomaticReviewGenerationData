<p>It is also possible that the metal nanoparticles in Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 are richer in Ga than those in sample with a Ga/Pt = 5.4 because of higher concentration of Ga in the bulk of the former catalyst.</p>
<p>The non-uniformity of the Ga/Pt ratio seen in Figs. 11 and 12 after</p>
<p>Reduction at 873 K suggests that the individual metal particles of the Ga/Pt ratios vary from one to another.</p>
<p>Upon reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at temperatures above 773 K, a portion of the Ga3+ near the surface of the support is reduced to Ga atoms which then migrate and diffuse into the supported Pt nanoparticles, thereby forming PtGa alloys of varying composition.</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose that during the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to form GaPt alloys.</p>

The evolution of research into vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s has been influenced by several factors. The primary drivers have been the need to find alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts, which are expensive and have environmental concerns. Since the 1980s, researchers have focused on optimizing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts through various methods. Key variables influencing their performance include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The carrier type affects the distribution and stability of vanadium species. A larger support surface area can lead to more efficient interaction between the catalyst and reactants. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium in the catalyst, impacting its activity and selectivity. Research has shown that the type of support, such as alumina, silica, or zeolites, can significantly affect the catalytic activity and stability of vanadium-based catalysts. Surface area and metal loading, when optimized, can enhance the efficiency of paraffin dehydrogenation reactions, leading to the production of alkenes from paraffins. The goal is to develop catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability, reducing the environmental impact and cost of the process.

<p>In a recent study [39], we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of eth- ane to ethene.</p>
<p>The highest dehydrogenation activity was obtained with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.3, whereas 100% ethene selectivity was achieved for a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.4, with only a small loss in dehydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>A further attraction of hydrotalcite-derived supports is that they can be prepared with elements other than Al, e.g., Zn, Ga, In.</p>
<p>We have recently exploited this characteristic by preparing and evaluating a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.</p>
<p>To achieve intimate contact between the Sn precursor and the Pt particles, reduced Pt/Mg(Al)O was reacted with tetrabutyl tin and then reduced in H2.</p>
<p>As-prepared catalyst samples (reduced at 723 K after Pt(acac)2 deposition) were pressed into wafers and then placed into a stainless steel cell in which the sample could be heated or cooled in the presence of flowing gas.</p>
<p>The presence of two peaks is due to two types of octahedrally coordinated Ga, differing in the presence of Mg or Mg and Al in the second nearest-neighbor coordination sphere.</p>
<p>As seen in spectrum B, increasing the Ga/Pt ratio to 12 had no detectable effect on the 71Ga NMR spectrum.</p>
<p>However, further increasing the Ga/Pt ratio to 96 (spec- trum C) resulted in the occurrence of additional peaks at 58.2 ppm and 201.1 ppm, characteristic of Ga cations with five- and fourfold coordination.</p>
<p>EXAFS analysis suggests that after reduction at 723 K, platinum is present as a mixture of Pt and PtOx.</p>
<p>An even larger change in the EXAFS pattern was observed when as-prepared Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 was reduced in H2 at 873 K.</p>
<p>In this case, the PtPt coordination (dPt Pt = 2.75 Å) was found to be 5.2  1.0 and the PtGa coordination (dPtGa = 2.58 Å) was found to be 3.6  2.4, giving a total Pt coordination of 8.8  3.3.</p>
<p>The Ga K-edge XANES and EXAFS patterns taken of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 reduced at 723 K and 873 K are shown in Fig. 10.</p>
<p>Virtually, no change in the patterns is observed either with Ga/Pt ratio or temperature of reduction, indicating that most of the Ga remains in the support and that migration of only a small amount of Ga to the Pt is responsible for the significant change in PtGa backscattering seen in Pt LIII edge EXAFS patterns.</p>
<p>The non-uniformity of the Ga/Pt ratio seen in Figs. 11 and 12 after reduction at 873 K suggests that the individual metal particles of the Ga/Pt ratios vary from one to another.</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose that during the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to form GaPt alloys.</p>

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts are not directly addressed. The catalyst preparation involves the introduction of the modifying element, Ga, from a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material. Pt nanoparticles are dispersed onto the support using an organometallic precursor, followed by reduction. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are described. The document proposes a mechanism for the formation of PtGa alloys during the synthesis and reaction of the catalysts, involving the reduction of Ga3+ near the surface of the support to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to form alloys. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the dispersion of Pt particles on the support. The size of the supported particles increases with increasing Ga content, reflecting the need for Al atoms at the support surface to anchor the dispersed Pt. The reduction of Ga3+ to Ga atoms at high temperatures allows for the formation of PtGa alloys, with the Ga/Pt ratio varying among individual metal particles.

<p>Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers.</p>
<p>A further attraction of alkane dehydrogenation is that hydrogen, the principal byproduct, is a valuable commodity that can readily be used for many purposes within a petroleum refinery,e.g., hydrocracking and heteroatom removal.</p>
<p>Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation.</p>
<p>Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16].</p>
<p>The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn. EXAFS [79], Mossbauer [1012], and TEM [1315] studies of supported SnPt catalysts suggest that Sn forms a variety of bimetallic alloys, which enhance the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene [1628].</p>
<p>The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O] [3136].</p>
<p>Mg(Ga)(Al)O is particularly attractive because it is moderately basic and exhibits high thermal stability to steam and reaction-oxidation cycling [37,38].</p>
<p>In a recent study [39], we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene.</p>

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on optimizing catalyst properties such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to improve the performance and selectivity of vanadium species in these catalysts.

2. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts are influenced by several variables. Carrier type affects the dispersion and stability of vanadium compounds, influencing their reactivity. A higher surface area of the support can increase the availability of vanadium sites, enhancing the catalytic activity. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium in the catalyst, impacting its reactivity balance between alkane dehydrogenation and coke formation. Proper tuning of these variables can lead to catalysts with improved efficiency and selectivity for paraffin dehydrogenation.
