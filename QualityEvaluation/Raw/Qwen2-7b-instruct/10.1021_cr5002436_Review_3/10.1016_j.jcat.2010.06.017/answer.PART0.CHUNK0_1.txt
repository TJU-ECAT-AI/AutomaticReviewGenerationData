<p>In a recent study [39], we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of eth- ane to ethene.</p>
<p>The highest dehydrogenation activity was obtained with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.3, whereas 100% ethene selectivity was achieved for a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.4, with only a small loss in dehydrogenation activity.</p>
<p>A further attraction of hydrotalcite-derived supports is that they can be prepared with elements other than Al, e.g., Zn, Ga, In.</p>
<p>We have recently exploited this characteristic by preparing and evaluating a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.</p>
<p>To achieve intimate contact between the Sn precursor and the Pt particles, reduced Pt/Mg(Al)O was reacted with tetrabutyl tin and then reduced in H2.</p>
<p>As-prepared catalyst samples (reduced at 723 K after Pt(acac)2 deposition) were pressed into wafers and then placed into a stainless steel cell in which the sample could be heated or cooled in the presence of flowing gas.</p>
<p>The presence of two peaks is due to two types of octahedrally coordinated Ga, differing in the presence of Mg or Mg and Al in the second nearest-neighbor coordination sphere.</p>
<p>As seen in spectrum B, increasing the Ga/Pt ratio to 12 had no detectable effect on the 71Ga NMR spectrum.</p>
<p>However, further increasing the Ga/Pt ratio to 96 (spec- trum C) resulted in the occurrence of additional peaks at 58.2 ppm and 201.1 ppm, characteristic of Ga cations with five- and fourfold coordination.</p>
<p>EXAFS analysis suggests that after reduction at 723 K, platinum is present as a mixture of Pt and PtOx.</p>
<p>An even larger change in the EXAFS pattern was observed when as-prepared Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 was reduced in H2 at 873 K.</p>
<p>In this case, the PtPt coordination (dPt Pt = 2.75 Å) was found to be 5.2  1.0 and the PtGa coordination (dPtGa = 2.58 Å) was found to be 3.6  2.4, giving a total Pt coordination of 8.8  3.3.</p>
<p>The Ga K-edge XANES and EXAFS patterns taken of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 reduced at 723 K and 873 K are shown in Fig. 10.</p>
<p>Virtually, no change in the patterns is observed either with Ga/Pt ratio or temperature of reduction, indicating that most of the Ga remains in the support and that migration of only a small amount of Ga to the Pt is responsible for the significant change in PtGa backscattering seen in Pt LIII edge EXAFS patterns.</p>
<p>The non-uniformity of the Ga/Pt ratio seen in Figs. 11 and 12 after reduction at 873 K suggests that the individual metal particles of the Ga/Pt ratios vary from one to another.</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose that during the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to form GaPt alloys.</p>

The document discusses the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts are not directly addressed. The catalyst preparation involves the introduction of the modifying element, Ga, from a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material. Pt nanoparticles are dispersed onto the support using an organometallic precursor, followed by reduction. The activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are described. The document proposes a mechanism for the formation of PtGa alloys during the synthesis and reaction of the catalysts, involving the reduction of Ga3+ near the surface of the support to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to form alloys. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the dispersion of Pt particles on the support. The size of the supported particles increases with increasing Ga content, reflecting the need for Al atoms at the support surface to anchor the dispersed Pt. The reduction of Ga3+ to Ga atoms at high temperatures allows for the formation of PtGa alloys, with the Ga/Pt ratio varying among individual metal particles.
