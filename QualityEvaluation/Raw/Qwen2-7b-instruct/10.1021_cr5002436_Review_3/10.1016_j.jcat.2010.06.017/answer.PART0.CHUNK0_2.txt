<p>Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers.</p>
<p>A further attraction of alkane dehydrogenation is that hydrogen, the principal byproduct, is a valuable commodity that can readily be used for many purposes within a petroleum refinery,e.g., hydrocracking and heteroatom removal.</p>
<p>Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation.</p>
<p>Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16].</p>
<p>The means by which the promoting element interacts with Pt and influences its catalytic properties are best understood for Sn. EXAFS [79], Mossbauer [1012], and TEM [1315] studies of supported SnPt catalysts suggest that Sn forms a variety of bimetallic alloys, which enhance the dissociative adsorption of the reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene [1628].</p>
<p>The composition of the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts influences the stability of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the support itself. Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O] [3136].</p>
<p>Mg(Ga)(Al)O is particularly attractive because it is moderately basic and exhibits high thermal stability to steam and reaction-oxidation cycling [37,38].</p>
<p>In a recent study [39], we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene.</p>
<p>A further attraction of hydrotalcite-derived supports is that they can be prepared with elements other than Al, e.g., Zn, Ga, In.</p>
<p>We have recently exploited this characteristic by preparing and evaluating a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.</p>

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts. Since the 1980s, research in this area has evolved significantly, focusing on optimizing catalyst properties such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading to improve the performance and selectivity of vanadium species in these catalysts.

2. The nature and behavior of vanadium species in vanadium oxide-based catalysts are influenced by several variables. Carrier type affects the dispersion and stability of vanadium compounds, influencing their reactivity. A higher surface area of the support can increase the availability of vanadium sites, enhancing the catalytic activity. Metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium in the catalyst, impacting its reactivity balance between alkane dehydrogenation and coke formation. Proper tuning of these variables can lead to catalysts with improved efficiency and selectivity for paraffin dehydrogenation.

1. 对于烷烃脱氢的探索，钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬酸盐（CrOx）的替代品，主要是为了提高效率、降低成本和环保性。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究取得了显著进展，着重优化催化剂的性质，如载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载，以改善钒物种在这些催化剂中的性能和选择性。

2. 钒氧化物基催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的影响。载体类型影响了钒化合物的分散性和稳定性，从而影响其活性。支持的比表面积越高，钒物种的可用性越大，可以增强催化活性。金属负载决定了催化剂中钒的浓度，影响了烷烃脱氢与焦炭形成之间的反应平衡。通过适当地调整这些变量，可以得到具有更高效率和选择性的催化剂。
