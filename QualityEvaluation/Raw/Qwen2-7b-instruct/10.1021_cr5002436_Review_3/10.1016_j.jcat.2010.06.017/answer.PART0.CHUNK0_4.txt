<p>In a recent study [39], we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene. The support was produced by calcining a hydrotac- lite-like precursor prepared with an Mg/Al ratio of 5.</p>
<p>After reduction at 723 K produces mainly metallic Pt particles. The average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles increased from 1.4 nm to 2.2 nm with increasing Ga content, and decreasing Al content of the support, demonstrating the importance of support Al atoms in stabilizing the dispersion of Pt.</p>
<p>Reduction at 773873 K, PtGa alloys were observed. It is proposed that at high reduction temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of the metal particles spill over onto the support where they reduce Ga3+ cation to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys.</p>
<p>The dispersion of the Pt particles on calcined hydrotalcite-like supports, determined by H2 chemisorption, is presented in Table 2. Pt supported on Mg(Al)O has a dispersion of 84%, corresponding to an average particle size of 1.35 nm. The dispersion of Pt on Mg(Ga)(Al)O tended to decrease with increasing Ga/Pt ratio from about 78% to 52%, corresponding to an increase in average Pt particle size from 1.5 to 2.2 nm.</p>
<p>Evidence for the interactions of Ga with Pt was obtained from EXAFS. Pt LIII edge EXAFS data were acquired for as-prepared Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 12, reduced in H2 at 723 K, and following reduction of 773 K (Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 5.4) and 873 K (Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 12).</p>
<p>Additional evidence for the formation of PtGa alloys was obtained from EDX analysis of the samples. EDX was conducted on larger particles of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 after reduction at 723 K and 873 K.</p>
<p>The non-uniformity of the Ga/Pt ratio seen in Figs. 11 and 12 after reduction at 873 K suggests that the individual metal particles of the Ga/Pt ratios vary from one to another.</p>
<p>We propose that during the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt nanoparticles to form GaPt alloys.</p>

This study describes the synthesis and characterization of a new catalyst, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, for alkane dehydrogenation. The introduction of Ga into the catalyst increases the average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles, ranging from 1.4 nm to 2.2 nm, and the dispersion of Pt tends to decrease with increasing Ga/Pt ratio, from 84% to 52%. The reduction of the catalyst at high temperatures (773 K to 873 K) leads to the formation of PtGa alloys, which are attributed to the reduction of Ga3+ cations to Ga atoms on the surface of the Pt particles, facilitating the formation of PtGa alloys. The dispersion and size of the Pt nanoparticles are influenced by the content of Ga and Al in the support, highlighting the role of Al atoms in stabilizing the dispersion of Pt. The proposed mechanism involves the spilling of H atoms from the Pt particles onto the support, reducing Ga3+ cations to Ga atoms, which then interact with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys.

这项研究描述了一种新型催化剂Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O的合成和表征，用于烷烃脱氢。Ga的引入增加了Pt纳米颗粒的平均直径，范围从1.4 nm到2.2 nm，并且随着Ga/Pt比例的增加，Pt的分散度从84%降低到52%。在较高温度（773 K至873 K）下还原催化剂会导致形成PtGa合金，这归因于表面Pt颗粒释放的H原子将Ga3+离子还原为Ga原子，从而促进形成PtGa合金。Pt纳米颗粒的分散性和大小受到支持物中Ga和Al含量的影响，强调了Al原子在稳定Pt分散中的作用。提出的机制涉及从Pt颗粒释放的H原子扩散到支撑体上，将Ga3+离子还原为Ga原子，然后与支撑的Pt相互作用形成PtGa合金。
