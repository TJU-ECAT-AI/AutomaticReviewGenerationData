The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the increasing availability of low-cost propane from shale gas and co-production of hydrogen. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Variables such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading affect the activity and stability of the catalysts. The use of Al2O3SiO2 materials, with varying SiO2 content, has shown promising results in enhancing the dehydrogenating activity of in situ formed carbon species, especially when the catalysts possess the largest possible surface area and an optimal ratio of support acidic sites to vanadium species. The optimal duration of the dehydrogenation cycle for Siral-based catalysts to prevent significant loss of initial propene yield is determined to be 6 hours. The presence of carbon deposits, which are initially formed on support sites, plays a crucial role in the catalyst's behavior, acting as an additional dehydrogenation site when vanadium species become covered by coke. However, their activity is lower compared to VOx species, leading to catalyst deactivation over time.

对于丙烷脱氢，使用铂和CrOx催化剂的探索已被低成本的页岩气中可获得的丙烷以及氢气的并行生产所推动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已专注于理解载体类型、支持表面面积和钼负载如何影响钼物种的性质和行为。诸如载体类型、支持表面面积和钼负载这样的变量会影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。使用含有不同SiO2含量的Al2O3SiO2材料在提高原位形成碳物种的脱氢活性方面显示出有希望的结果，特别是当催化剂具有最大的可能表面积和支持酸性位点与钼物种的最佳比例时。对于Siral基催化剂，确定6小时为避免初始丙烯产量显著损失的理想脱氢周期长度。碳沉积物的存在起着关键作用，这些沉积物最初在支持位点上形成，当钼物种被焦炭覆盖时，它们充当额外的脱氢位点。然而，它们的活性低于钼氧化物物种，导致催化剂随时间失效。

Introduction Propene is the second most important petrochemical after ethylene with an annual production of around 79 million metric tons in 2011.1 Its demand has been steadily growing for the past twenty years thanks to rising production of various polymers. Today, propene is mostly produced as a by-product of the steam cracking of naphtha and liquid petroleum gas or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy frac- tions of crude oils. Since the existing production capacities cannot completely fulfil the propene demand, two alternative processes were commercialized: non-oxidative propane dehy- drogenation (DH)2 and metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene.3 The former becomes increasingly important given the avail- ability of low cost propane from shale gas and co-production of hydrogen. Moreover, the dehydrogenation route is inde- pendent of the state of steam crackers or FCC plants, unlike the metathesis process.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective methods of propene production. Since the 1980s, researchers have been investigating the use of vanadium species, particularly in the context of non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH), due to its independence from the operational status of steam crackers or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) plants. The availability of low-cost propane from shale gas has further emphasized the importance of DH technology. Research in this area aims to optimize the nature and behavior of vanadium species in catalysts, considering factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.

Continuous flow catalytic tests
DH
tests were carried out in a multi-channel set-up consisting of 15 plug flow fixed-bed quartz tube reactors of
3.8 mm inner diameter. All catalytic experiments were carried
out at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1200 L h1 kg1 and an overall pressure of 1.2 bar. Each reactor was filled with 300 mg of fresh catalyst. The catalysts were initially heated in parallel at 5 K min1 to 550 C in air (10 mL min1 per reactor), held in air flow for 1 h and then flushed with N2 for 20 min. Hereafter, a mixture of 40 vol.% C3H8 in N2 was fed at a rate of 6 mL min1 per reactor. The experiment was run for either 6 or 27 h followed by cooling the reactors to room temperature in N2.
