[1] "The highest spacetime yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst 3 at a propane conversion of 30% were achieved over the catalysts based on the Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively."
[2] "The optimal duration of the DH cycle without a significant loss of initial propene yield over Siral-based catalysts was determined to be 6 h."
[3] "Since their activity is significantly lower than that of VOx species, the catalysts start to deactivate when the latter also become covered by coke."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the increasing availability of low-cost propane from shale gas and co-production of hydrogen. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on understanding the role of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Variables such as the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading affect the activity and stability of the catalysts. The use of Al2O3SiO2 materials, with varying SiO2 content, has shown promising results in enhancing the dehydrogenating activity of in situ formed carbon species, especially when the catalysts possess the largest possible surface area and an optimal ratio of support acidic sites to vanadium species. The optimal duration of the dehydrogenation cycle for Siral-based catalysts to prevent significant loss of initial propene yield is determined to be 6 hours. The presence of carbon deposits, which are initially formed on support sites, plays a crucial role in the catalyst's behavior, acting as an additional dehydrogenation site when vanadium species become covered by coke. However, their activity is lower compared to VOx species, leading to catalyst deactivation over time.

对于丙烷脱氢，使用铂和CrOx催化剂的探索已被低成本的页岩气中可获得的丙烷以及氢气的并行生产所推动。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已专注于理解载体类型、支持表面面积和钼负载如何影响钼物种的性质和行为。诸如载体类型、支持表面面积和钼负载这样的变量会影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。使用含有不同SiO2含量的Al2O3SiO2材料在提高原位形成碳物种的脱氢活性方面显示出有希望的结果，特别是当催化剂具有最大的可能表面积和支持酸性位点与钼物种的最佳比例时。对于Siral基催化剂，确定6小时为避免初始丙烯产量显著损失的理想脱氢周期长度。碳沉积物的存在起着关键作用，这些沉积物最初在支持位点上形成，当钼物种被焦炭覆盖时，它们充当额外的脱氢位点。然而，它们的活性低于钼氧化物物种，导致催化剂随时间失效。
