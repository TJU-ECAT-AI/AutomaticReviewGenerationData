Introduction Propene is the second most important petrochemical after ethylene with an annual production of around 79 million metric tons in 2011.1 Its demand has been steadily growing for the past twenty years thanks to rising production of various polymers. Today, propene is mostly produced as a by-product of the steam cracking of naphtha and liquid petroleum gas or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy frac- tions of crude oils. Since the existing production capacities cannot completely fulfil the propene demand, two alternative processes were commercialized: non-oxidative propane dehy- drogenation (DH)2 and metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene.3 The former becomes increasingly important given the avail- ability of low cost propane from shale gas and co-production of hydrogen. Moreover, the dehydrogenation route is inde- pendent of the state of steam crackers or FCC plants, unlike the metathesis process.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more efficient and cost-effective methods of propene production. Since the 1980s, researchers have been investigating the use of vanadium species, particularly in the context of non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH), due to its independence from the operational status of steam crackers or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) plants. The availability of low-cost propane from shale gas has further emphasized the importance of DH technology. Research in this area aims to optimize the nature and behavior of vanadium species in catalysts, considering factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.

对于丙烯的生产，铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）等催化剂的替代品，尤其是非氧化性丙烷脱氢（DH）催化剂的研究，已被驱动以实现更高效、成本效益更高的生产方法。自1980年代以来，研究人员一直在探索使用各种钒物种，特别是在无氧丙烷脱氢的情况下，因为它不受蒸汽裂解器或流化床催化裂化（FCC）装置运行状态的影响。从页岩气中获得的低成本丙烷的可用性进一步强调了DH技术的重要性。研究领域旨在优化催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，考虑载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等因素。

Continuous flow catalytic tests
DH
tests were carried out in a multi-channel set-up consisting of 15 plug flow fixed-bed quartz tube reactors of
3.8 mm inner diameter. All catalytic experiments were carried
out at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1200 L h1 kg1 and an overall pressure of 1.2 bar. Each reactor was filled with 300 mg of fresh catalyst. The catalysts were initially heated in parallel at 5 K min1 to 550 C in air (10 mL min1 per reactor), held in air flow for 1 h and then flushed with N2 for 20 min. Hereafter, a mixture of 40 vol.% C3H8 in N2 was fed at a rate of 6 mL min1 per reactor. The experiment was run for either 6 or 27 h followed by cooling the reactors to room temperature in N2.

The catalysts were initially heated in parallel at a rate of 5 K/min to reach 550°C in an air environment (10 mL/min per reactor), then maintained at this temperature for 1 hour before being flushed with nitrogen for 20 minutes. Following this, a mixture of 40% volume of propane (C3H8) in nitrogen was introduced at a flow rate of 6 mL/min per reactor. The experiments were run for either 6 or 27 hours, after which the reactors were cooled to room temperature in nitrogen.

Analysis of formation and removal of carbon deposits To quantify carbon deposits formed during the DH reaction,we performed TPO of spent catalysts after the 27 h experi- ment and after the 10th cycle of the 6 h test. The amounts of carbon formed in the corresponding DH tests were deter- mined by integrating the CO and CO2 profiles recorded in the TPO tests and are given in Table 1.

To assess the formation and removal of carbon deposits during the dehydrogenation process, we conducted thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) tests on spent catalysts after a 27-hour experiment and after the 10th cycle of a 6-hour test. The quantities of carbon produced in these respective dehydrogenation tests were calculated by integrating the CO and CO2 profiles recorded during the TPO tests and are listed in Table 1.
