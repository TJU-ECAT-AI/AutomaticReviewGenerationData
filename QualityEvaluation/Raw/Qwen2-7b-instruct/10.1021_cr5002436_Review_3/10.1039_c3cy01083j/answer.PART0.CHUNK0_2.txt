<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document explores the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on the effects of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the stability and activity of vanadium oxide species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reactions.
