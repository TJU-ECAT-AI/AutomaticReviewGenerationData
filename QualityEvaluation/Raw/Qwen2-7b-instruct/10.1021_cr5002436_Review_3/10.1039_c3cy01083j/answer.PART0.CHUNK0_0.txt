[1] "Propene is the second most important petrochemical after ethylene with an annual production of around 79 million metric tons in 2011."
[2] "Since the existing production capacities cannot completely fulfill the propene demand, two alternative processes were commercialized: non-oxidative propane dehy- drogenation (DH) and metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene."
[3] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."
[4] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction."
[5] "All catalysts deactivated with time on stream, but restored their initial performance after oxidative regeneration as proven in a sequence of 10 DH/regeneration cycles lasting in total over 60 h."
[6] "Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species."
[7] "The highest spacetime yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst 3 at a propane conversion of 30% were achieved over the catalysts based on the Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively."
[8] "The optimal duration of the DH cycle without a significant loss of initial propene yield over Siral-based catalysts was determined to be 6 h."

1. Propene is a key petrochemical with significant annual production, and alternative processes like non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) have been developed due to the inability to meet the propene demand with existing production capacities.

2. VOx-based catalysts were explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts in the DH reaction, aiming to improve on-stream stability and performance.

3. The highest spacetime yield of propene achieved with VOx catalysts was only 25% lower than that with industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts under comparable conditions.

4. The research aimed to enhance the potential of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. Catalysts showed deactivation over time, but regained their initial performance after oxidative regeneration, demonstrating stable catalytic behavior.

6. The acidic properties of the support material were critical in generating active carbon species involved in the DH process.

7. Catalysts with Al2O3 supports containing 10% and 1% SiO2 showed the highest spacetime yields of propene production, reaching 146 and 158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst 3, respectively.

8. An optimal 6-hour duration for the DH cycle was determined to prevent significant loss of initial propene yield over Siral-based catalysts.

1. 丙烯是仅次于乙烯的重要石油化工产品，2011年的年度产量约为7900万吨。

2. 由于现有生产能力无法完全满足丙烯需求，两种替代工艺被商业化：非氧化性丙烷脱氢（DH）和乙烷与2-丁烯的裂解。

3. 在相同的反应条件下，使用VOx基催化剂获得的最高时空产率比工业相关PtSn/Al2O3低25%。

4. 研究旨在进一步探索基于VOx的催化剂在DH反应中的潜力。

5. 所有催化剂随时间下降，但在氧化再生后恢复了初始性能，在一系列10个DH/再生周期中持续了超过60小时。

6. 支持材料的酸性性质对于产生参与DH过程的活性碳物种至关重要。

7. 含有10%和1%二氧化硅的Al2O3支持的催化剂显示出最高的时空产率，分别达到146和158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst 3。

8. 确定了6小时的最优DH周期长度，以防止Siral基催化剂初始丙烯产率的显著损失。
