1. Five commercial dehydrogenation (DH) technologies vary in reactor type, operational mode, and catalyst use. Chromia alumina catalysts are utilized in CATOFIN and FBD-3, while alumina-supported platinum catalysts are used in Oleflex, PDH, and STAR processes.
2. The highest spacetime yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst 3 were achieved at 30% propane conversion over catalysts based on Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively.
3. All catalysts deactivated over time on stream but restored their initial performance after oxidative regeneration, proven in a sequence of 10 DH/regeneration cycles spanning over 60 h.
4. The acidic properties of the support are essential for generating catalytically active carbon species.

1. 五种商业化的脱氢（DH）技术在反应器类型、操作模式和催化剂使用上有所不同。CATOFIN（授权给LummusHoudry）和FBD-3（SnamprogettiYarsintez）使用铬氧化铝催化剂，而奥莱克斯（UOP）、PDH（LindeBASFStatoil）和STAR（Krupp Uhde）过程则使用铝氧载体铂催化剂。
2. 在30%丙烷转化率下，基于Sirol支持物的催化剂，其中SiO2含量分别为10wt.%和1wt.%，最高实现了146和158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst 3的时空产率。
3. 所有催化剂在流化床运行中逐渐失效，但在氧化再生后恢复了初始性能，这在10个连续的DH/再生循环中得到证实，这些循环总共持续了超过60小时。
4. 支持物的酸性特性对于生成催化活性碳物种至关重要。
