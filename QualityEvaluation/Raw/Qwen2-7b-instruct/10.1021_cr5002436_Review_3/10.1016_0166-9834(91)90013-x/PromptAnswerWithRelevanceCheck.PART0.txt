[1] "The nature and surface distribution of the molybdenum species present on supported molybdena catalysts, which depend strongly on the preparation conditions (impregnation procedure, molybdenum loading, pH of impregnation,drying and calcination conditions, nature of the support, etc. ) , have been the subject of numerous investigations using various physico-chemical techniques [l-6 and references therein], including temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."
[2] "Since it would be interesting to examine the pH effect for catalysts covering a wide range of molybdenum loadings, we report in this work a comparative study of the effect of the impregnation pH on the structure of MOO,supported on A1203 and Si02 by a combined use of TPR, X-ray diffraction (XRD ), and zeta potential measurements."
[3] "The specific surface area of calcined catalysts decreased slightly with increasing molybdenum loading, probably due to blocking of the narrower pores of the support."
[4] "In the case of SiOz-supported catalysts, the detection of diffraction lines whose positions are in good agreement with crystalline MOO, occurred at relatively low (6 wt.-% MOO,) loading and even at basic pH, as Figs. lb and c show, but their relative intensities do not completely agree with Moos. These lines were significantly more intense at acidic pH, and obviously at high mo- lybdenum loadings."
[5] "For the purpose of a better comparison, Fig. 3 shows the variation of the ZPC with the molybdenum loading for the catalysts prepared at pH 2 and 11."
[6] "Thus the Mo(6)A-2 catalysts exhibited practically only a reduction peak in the high temperature region (T,,, cz 849 C ), while the 18 wt.-% MOO,loadings catalysts presented two well defined peaks at ca. 445 and ca. 770 C, respectively."
[7] "This increase of MO, species upon decreasing the impregnation pH, can be understood by considering that the impregnation pH controls the proportion of MOO:-
and Mo,Oz,through the equilibrium 7MoOi- + 8H+ +Mo,O& +4Hz0 and also the surface charge of the support according to its IEP."
[8] "The peak at ca. 490 C, which is indicative of a discrete MOO,phase."
[9] "Another significant difference between the A1203- and SiO,-supported catalysts is that for the latter there appeared a second peak ( T_ - - 600 o C ), very close to that corresponding to the first reduction step of bulk Mo03."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient catalytic systems. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the composition and structure of catalysts to enhance their performance. Key factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include the carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading.

1. The nature and surface distribution of molybdenum species on supported molybdena catalysts, which are crucial for their catalytic activity, are influenced by preparation conditions such as impregnation procedure, molybdenum loading, pH of impregnation, drying and calcination conditions, nature of the support, etc.

2. To investigate the impact of impregnation pH on the structure of molybdenum oxides supported on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2), a comparative study using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and zeta potential measurements was conducted.

3. As molybdenum loading increases, the specific surface area of calcined catalysts tends to decrease slightly due to the blocking of narrower pores within the support material.

4. For silica-supported catalysts, the detection of diffraction lines matching crystalline molybdenum oxide occurred at low molybdenum loadings and even at basic pH levels. These lines were more intense at acidic pH and high molybdenum loadings, indicating the formation of crystalline molybdenum oxide species.

5. The variation of the zero point of charge (ZPC) with molybdenum loading was plotted for catalysts prepared at pH 2 and 11, providing insights into the dispersion of molybdenum species on the surface.

6. Catalysts with 6% molybdenum loading exhibited only one reduction peak at higher temperatures, whereas catalysts with 18% molybdenum loading showed two distinct peaks at around 445°C and 770°C, respectively.

7. The increase in the proportion of octahedrally coordinated molybdenum species upon decreasing the impregnation pH is attributed to the control of the proportion of molybdenum oxide species through the equilibrium reactions and the surface charge of the support.

8. The presence of a peak at approximately 490°C signifies the existence of a discrete crystalline molybdenum oxide phase.

9. A second peak was observed in the TPR profiles of silica-supported catalysts at around 600°C, closely resembling the first reduction step of bulk molybdenum oxide, indicating the presence of two different molybdenum oxide bulk phases with varying characteristics.

对于将钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）替代品用于烷烃脱氢的探索，主要是为了寻找更经济、环保且高效的催化系统。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，重点是优化催化剂的组成和结构以提高其性能。影响钒物种在这些催化剂中性质和行为的关键因素包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载。

1. 支撑钼化物催化剂上钼物种的性质和表面分布受到浸渍程序、钼负载量、浸渍pH值、干燥和煅烧条件、支撑材料性质等因素的影响。

2. 对于铝氧化物（Al2O3）和二氧化硅（SiO2）支持的钼氧化物催化剂，通过比较温度程序化还原（TPR）、X射线衍射（XRD）和ζ电位测量的方法，研究了浸渍pH值对其结构的影响。

3. 当钼负载量增加时，煅烧后催化剂的特定表面积略有下降，这可能是由于支撑材料中较窄孔道被堵塞所致。

4. 对于二氧化硅支持的催化剂，在较低钼负载量和甚至基本pH水平下检测到了与结晶钼氧化物相匹配的衍射线。这些线条在酸性pH和高钼负载量下更为强烈，表明形成了结晶钼氧化物物种。

5. 对于在pH 2和11下制备的催化剂，钼负载量与零点电荷（ZPC）的变化图提供了有关表面钼物种分散的信息。

6. 针对6%钼负载量的催化剂仅在较高温度区域表现出一个还原峰，而18%钼负载量的催化剂则显示出两个清晰的峰，分别位于约445°C和770°C。

7. 降低浸渍pH值导致钼物种比例增加的解释是，浸渍pH值控制了钼氧化物物种的比例以及通过平衡反应和支撑体的表面电荷。

8. 大约490°C处的峰表示存在一个离散的结晶钼氧化物相。

9. 硅支持催化剂的TPR轮廓中观察到大约600°C的一个第二峰，非常接近纯钼氧化物的第一还原步骤，表明存在两种不同钼氧化物固态相，其特性有所不同。
