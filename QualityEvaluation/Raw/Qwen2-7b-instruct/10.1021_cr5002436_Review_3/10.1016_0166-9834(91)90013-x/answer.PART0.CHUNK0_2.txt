[1] "The influence of the impregnation pH (at 2-11) and molybdenum content (6-18 wt.-% MOO,) on the surface structure of Mo03/A1203 and MoO,/SiO,catalysts has been studied by temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction and zeta potential measurements."
[2] "Recently, the sensitivity of the TPR technique to detect the changes in the surface structure of alumina-supported molybdena catalysts produced by phosphorus incorporation has been shown."
[3] "Since the phosphorus is usually added as phosphoric acid, which implies the use of impregnating solutions with different pH, depending on the preparation method and the loadings of phosphorus and active metal, it is thus interesting to determine the influ- ence of the pH of the impregnating solution, independently of the effect of phosphorus."
[4] "We report in this work a comparative study of the effect of the impregnation pH on the structure of MOO,supported on A1203 and Si02 by a combined use of TPR, X-ray diffraction (XRD ), and zeta potential measurements."
[5] "The specific surface area of calcined catalysts decreased slightly with increasing molybdenum loading, probably due to blocking of the narrower pores of the support."
[6] "Attempts to confirm this genesis of Al,(MoO,),by XRD study of MO (18)A-2 samples calcined at 300 and 400 C failed; their diffractograms showed lines hardly distinguishable from the background of A1203,"
[7] "The XRD patterns of all the Al,O,-supported catalysts, except the MO (14)A-2, did not differ significantly from that of the A1203, which is in accordance with the literature [ 10,16,17]."
[8] "The XRD patterns of the catalysts prepared at pH 2 exhibited a higher sharpness than those prepared at pH 11, as Fig. 1 shows."
[9] "In contrast with the AlaOs-supported catalysts, all the SiO,-supported cat- alysts showed the peak at T,,, - - 490 C, which is indicative of a discrete MOO,phase."
[10] "This MOO,phase which forms predominantly at acidic pH values may result from the unadsorbed Mo,O& species, and also from the decomposition of the molybdosilicic acid which was formed during the impregnation."
[11] "The presence of small crystals of MOO, in the silica catalysts was corroborated by the XRD results (Fig. lb and c)."
