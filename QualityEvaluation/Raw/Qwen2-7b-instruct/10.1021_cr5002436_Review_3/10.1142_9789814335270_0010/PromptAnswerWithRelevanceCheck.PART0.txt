1. The growth of consumer credit in Asia has been significant in recent years, driven by factors such as the US household indebtedness and global financial turmoil. The levels of credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always smoothly matched those in mature markets. This has been partly due to a relaxation in screening and lending standards of card issuers amidst increased market competition. There was also a failure of market discipline, leading to a situation where policy interventions resembled crisis management operations.

2. An important question in the context of the 2003 Korean credit card crisis was whether the levels of credit card cash advances impact the asset quality of card lending portfolios. Research found strong evidence suggesting that higher levels of cash advances indeed worsen the asset quality.

3. Policymakers in other Asian markets have acknowledged the lessons from the three episodes of credit card lending distress in Asia. They have implemented measures to address the risks, focusing on early detection of warning signs, enhancing information flows, and upgrading prudential and supervisory frameworks.

4. The Korean credit card crisis was characterized by a boom in credit card lending, driven by government policies aimed at cushioning the economic downturn after the Asian financial crisis. However, the role of tax incentives was overstated, as the bulk of increased credit card spending was likely a simple substitution for cash spending. The crisis also involved the failure of market discipline, with the bond market failing to price the rising credit risks adequately.

5. The 2003 Korean credit card crisis saw the bond market failing to price the rising credit risks of card companies until the full crisis broke out. This encouraged aggressive balance sheet expansion, as the quality of card issuers' portfolios deteriorated. The failure of market discipline can be attributed to information asymmetry, regulatory authorities' late disclosure of information, and opaque and complex ABS deals. The lack of effective market discipline is a case of market failure.

6. The Korean credit card crisis was influenced by the business model of monoline credit card operations relying on wholesale funding. This model resembles an originate and distribute type, which might encourage regulatory arbitrage and lax underwriting standards. The widespread re-aging practice among card issuers also delayed the recognition of the problem, allowing excessive accumulation of risk during the lending boom phase.

7. The Korean government intervened in the crisis through providing liquidity support to the financial market and arranging a controversial rescue of the failing LG Card. The rescue was large-scale, involving the state-owned Korean Development Bank (KDB) lending to LG Card, ensuring the joint control of LG Card by the creditor banks, and eventually coordinating a debt-equity swap to wipe out the majority shareholders' equity and substantially reduce the minority shareholders'.

8. The Korean credit card crisis highlighted the role of excessive cash advances in affecting asset quality. The findings showed that higher levels of cash advances, especially those lagged two and three quarters, were major determinants of the quality of credit card assets.

9. The Korean credit card crisis had significant effects on the financial system, causing a contraction in credit card receivables and heavy losses for card issuers. The crisis was most spectacular in Korea, with credit card balances equivalent to as much as one-fifth of total bank loans outstanding at the peak of the boom.

10. The unwinding of the earlier excess lending in Korea sometimes intertwined with ongoing local business down cycles. The crisis led to a credit crunch and a prolonged downturn in private consumption in 2003. In contrast, credit card woes in Hong Kong were overshadowed by the protracted local asset price deflation at the time.

11. The Korean experience underscores the importance of policymakers focusing on detecting early warning signs before imbalances build up excessively for too long. It is crucial to recognize that a benign economic environment does not guarantee the absence of a consumer debt crisis. Policymakers need to strengthen their capacity for on-site examinations and maintain access to confidential information, particularly during market development transitions.

12. Governments can assist in enhancing information flows in the consumer credit market by encouraging credit information reporting and sharing. This facilitates the functioning of the market and helps mitigate information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers.

13. Policymakers may benefit from upgrading their prudential and supervisory frameworks, especially during the liberalization process. This includes refining and differentiating provisioning requirements for credit card receivables, setting capital requirements as a cushion for off-balance sheet securitization, and imposing restrictions like income tests, credit limits, and minimum repayment requirements to enhance financial stability.

1. 近年来，亚洲消费者信贷的增长显著，部分原因是美国家庭债务过多和全球金融动荡。亚洲信用卡持有量和贷款额并未总是平滑地达到成熟市场的水平。这在一定程度上是由于信用卡发行商在加剧的市场竞争中放宽了筛选和贷款标准。市场纪律的失败也是一个问题，债券市场未能充分定价信贷风险，直到危机全面爆发。

2. 韩国2003年的信用卡危机中，一个关键问题是信用卡现金借款水平如何影响信用卡贷款组合的质量。研究发现，较高的现金借款确实损害了资产质量。

3. 其他亚洲国家的政策制定者已经注意到了亚洲这三个信用卡贷款困境的教训，并相应地采取了措施来应对风险，包括加强早期预警信号的检测、增强信息流通以及升级审慎和监管框架。

4. 政策制定者通过政府政策缓解亚洲金融危机后经济衰退的影响，导致信用卡借贷激增。然而，税激励的作用被夸大了，因为大部分增加的信用卡支出可能是现金支出的简单替代品。危机也涉及市场纪律的失败，债券市场未能在卡公司投资组合质量恶化时合理定价。

5. 韩国信用卡危机中，债券市场未能充分定价卡公司的信贷风险，直到全面危机爆发。这种做法鼓励了银行激进的资产负债表扩张。市场纪律的失败可以归因于信息不对称、监管机构迟缓的信息披露以及复杂和不透明的ABS交易。缺乏有效的市场纪律是一种市场失灵的情况。

6. 韩国信用卡危机受到依赖批发融资的信用卡业务模式的影响。这种模式类似于一种发起和分发类型，可能鼓励监管套利和宽松的放贷标准。信用卡发行商普遍采用的再老化实践也延迟了问题的识别，允许风险在贷款繁荣阶段过度积累。

7. 韩国政府通过向金融市场提供流动性支持和安排LG卡的争议性救援介入危机。这包括韩国开发银行（KDB）对LG卡的贷款、确保债权人银行控制LG卡，并最终协调了一项债务-股权交换，使得债权人银行记录了3万亿韩元的会计利润。

8. 韩国信用卡危机强调了在信贷过度增长过长之前，政策制定者重视检测早期预警信号的重要性。需要认识到，在良好的经济环境下，不会保证没有消费者债务危机。政策制定者需要加强现场检查能力并保持机密信息访问权，尤其是在市场发展转型期间。

9. 政府可以通过鼓励信用信息报告和共享来帮助增强消费者信贷市场的信息流通。这有助于缓解放贷者与借款人之间的信息不对称，促进市场的正常运作。

10. 政策制定者可以从改善审慎和监管框架中受益，尤其是在自由化过程中。这包括细化和差异化信用卡应收账款的拨备要求、设定针对或有负债证券的资本要求、实施如收入测试、信贷限额和最低还款要求等限制措施以增强金融稳定性。

11. 韩国的经验强调了政策制定者在信贷累积过度过长之前重视检测早期预警信号的重要性。需要认识到，良好的经济环境并不保证没有消费者债务危机。政策制定者需要加强现场检查能力并保持机密信息访问权，特别是在市场发展过渡期。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to reduce costs and environmental impacts associated with traditional catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the properties of vanadium species within the catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the behavior and efficiency of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors influence the structure and activity of the catalysts, affecting the conversion of paraffins to olefins during the dehydrogenation process.

2. The factors that have contributed to the unsustainable credit lending boom in Asia, particularly in the context of the Korean credit card market, include easy monetary conditions, financial liberalization, economies of scale in the credit card business, limited information reporting and sharing, various forms of the principal-agent problem, and the seasoning effect of a fast-growing lending portfolio. These factors collectively led to a relaxation of lending standards, excessive growth in credit card lending, and a subsequent boom-bust cycle characterized by rising credit costs, tightened lending standards, contracting credit, increased credit loss, significant balance sheet adjustments, heightened risks to the financial system, and economic damages.

3. Excessive indebtedness played a pivotal role in exacerbating the Korean credit card crisis. As credit card debt accumulated, it led to higher credit costs, tighter lending standards, and a contraction of credit availability. This, in turn, resulted in further credit loss, large balance sheet adjustments, increased risks to the financial system, and economic downturns. The situation was exacerbated by the collapse of the asset quality of credit card portfolios, leading to a scenario akin to a credit crunch where credit contraction and deterioration in asset quality reinforced each other.

4. The role of cash advances in the credit card asset quality of the Korean credit card market was significant. The study found strong evidence that higher levels of cash advances, particularly those lagged two and three quarters, were major determinants of the quality of credit card assets. This suggests that excessive cash lending and the deliberate targeting of the less creditworthy segment of the market by credit card companies led to riskier card portfolios, poorer asset quality, and eventual credit losses. The seasoning effect in credit card lending might have initially boosted earnings for issuers, but higher levels of cash advances increased the riskiness of the card portfolio.

5. Policymakers should focus on detecting early warning signs of imbalances building up excessively for too long before they reach critical levels. It is challenging to sound the alarm when profits are on the rise during a lending boom. However, reasonable average debt-to-GDP or liability-to-asset ratios and low initial losses should not lead to complacency. Policymakers need to strengthen their capacity to recognize problems early, especially during periods of structural change and economic prosperity, to prevent potential crises.

6. Enhancing information flows to facilitate the functioning of the consumer credit market is essential. This includes encouraging credit information reporting and sharing to mitigate information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers. Following the recent episodes of distress, credit reporting and sharing in both Hong Kong and Korea have improved considerably. The implementation of a central consumer credit information service that provides both negative and positive credit data in Hong Kong and the refinement and enhancement of the local system in Taiwan demonstrate the importance of maintaining robust and comprehensive credit reporting systems.

7. Upgrading prudential and supervisory frameworks is necessary, particularly during the liberalization process. This includes refining and differentiating provisioning requirements for credit card receivables, implementing explicit capital requirements for retained exposure or contingent liabilities arising from off-balance sheet securitization, and imposing restrictions on income tests, credit limits, and minimum repayment requirements. These restrictions, when deployed preemptively or sufficiently early, can enhance financial stability and mitigate risks associated with consumer lending.

8. The challenges in managing credit card lending crises highlight the importance of proactive policymaking and the need for continuous improvement in prudential regulations. The experiences from the Korean credit card crisis have led to the introduction of formal guidelines on credit card operations, such as setting minimum annual income requirements, credit limits, and minimum monthly repayment requirements, in countries like Thailand and Indonesia. These measures aim to mitigate risks and prevent future crises by ensuring a more balanced and sustainable growth of credit card lending.

1. 随着对铂金(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)等传统催化剂成本和环境影响的减少的需求，对钒氧化物基催化剂作为替代品的研究已显著增加，用于石蜡脱氢。自1980年代以来，这一领域研究的发展集中在优化催化剂中的钒物种属性上。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量在决定催化剂中钒物种的行为和效率方面起着关键作用。这些因素影响催化结构和活性，影响石蜡在脱氢过程中转化为烯烃的过程。

2. 近年来亚洲消费者信贷的快速增长，特别是在韩国信用卡市场的危机中，是由宽松的货币政策、金融自由化、信用卡业务的规模经济、有限的信息报告与共享、代理问题的多种形式以及快速增长贷款组合的季节效应共同推动的。这些因素导致了放贷标准的放松、信用卡贷款的过度增长，并引发了一波又一波的危机，表现为信贷成本上升、放贷标准收紧、信贷紧缩、信用损失增加、大量资产负债表调整、金融系统风险增加和经济损害。

3. 过度负债加剧了韩国信用卡危机。随着信用卡债务的积累，它导致了更高的信贷成本、更严格的放贷标准和信贷供给的收缩。这反过来导致了进一步的信用损失、大规模资产负债表调整、金融系统风险增加和经济衰退。资产质量的崩溃是这种情况的关键因素，导致了一种类似于信贷紧缩的状况，其中信贷紧缩和资产质量恶化相互强化。

4. 韩国信用卡市场中现金借款对资产质量的影响是显著的。研究发现，特别滞后两季度和三个季度的高额现金借款是信用卡资产质量的主要决定因素。这表明，过度的现金借贷和信用卡公司对较不信用客户群的故意目标定位导致了风险较高的信用卡组合、较低的资产质量和最终的信贷损失。信贷卡贷款的“调味”效应可能最初提高了发行商的收益，但较高的现金借款水平增加了信用卡组合的风险性。

5. 政府应关注在过长的时间内累积过多不平衡的早期预警信号，在利润上升的时期发出警报是一个挑战。然而，合理的平均债务/GDP或负债/总资产比率和初始较低的损失不应导致自满。政府需要加强其能力，以尽早识别问题，特别是在结构性变化和经济繁荣期间，以防止潜在的危机。

6. 增强信用市场信息流通，促进信用信息报告与共享，对于缓解放贷者与借款人之间的信息不对称至关重要。从最近的困境事件中，香港和韩国的信用报告和共享有了显著改进。香港实施了一个提供负面和正面信用数据的中央消费者信用信息服务，而台湾对本地系统的改进和增强则强调了保持强大和全面信用报告系统的重要性。

7. 在金融自由化进程期间，升级审慎和监管框架是必要的。这包括细化为信用卡应收账款制定的拨备要求，实施保留暴露或与离散账簿证券化相关的潜在负债的明确资本要求，以及对收入测试、信用限额和最低还款要求的限制。当这些限制在提前部署或足够早时被实施时，它们可以增强金融稳定性和减轻与消费者贷款相关风险。

8. 管理信用卡贷款危机的挑战突显了前瞻性的政策制定和持续改进审慎法规的重要性。韩国信用卡危机的经验导致泰国和印尼等国家引入了关于信用卡操作的正式指导方针，如设定最低年度收入要求、信用限额和最低月度还款要求。这些措施旨在通过确保信用卡贷款的平衡和可持续增长来减轻风险。
