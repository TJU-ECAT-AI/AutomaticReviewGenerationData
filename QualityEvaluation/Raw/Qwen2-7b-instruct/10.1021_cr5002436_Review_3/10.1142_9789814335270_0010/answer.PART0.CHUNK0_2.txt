1. The growth of consumer credit in Asia has been significant in recent years, driven by factors such as the US household indebtedness and global financial turmoil. The levels of credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always smoothly matched those in mature markets. This has been partly due to a relaxation in screening and lending standards of card issuers amidst increased market competition. There was also a failure of market discipline, leading to a situation where policy interventions resembled crisis management operations.

2. An important question in the context of the 2003 Korean credit card crisis was whether the levels of credit card cash advances impact the asset quality of card lending portfolios. Research found strong evidence suggesting that higher levels of cash advances indeed worsen the asset quality.

3. Policymakers in other Asian markets have acknowledged the lessons from the three episodes of credit card lending distress in Asia. They have implemented measures to address the risks, focusing on early detection of warning signs, enhancing information flows, and upgrading prudential and supervisory frameworks.

4. The Korean credit card crisis was characterized by a boom in credit card lending, driven by government policies aimed at cushioning the economic downturn after the Asian financial crisis. However, the role of tax incentives was overstated, as the bulk of increased credit card spending was likely a simple substitution for cash spending. The crisis also involved the failure of market discipline, with the bond market failing to price the rising credit risks adequately.

5. The 2003 Korean credit card crisis saw the bond market failing to price the rising credit risks of card companies until the full crisis broke out. This encouraged aggressive balance sheet expansion, as the quality of card issuers' portfolios deteriorated. The failure of market discipline can be attributed to information asymmetry, regulatory authorities' late disclosure of information, and opaque and complex ABS deals. The lack of effective market discipline is a case of market failure.

6. The Korean credit card crisis was influenced by the business model of monoline credit card operations relying on wholesale funding. This model resembles an originate and distribute type, which might encourage regulatory arbitrage and lax underwriting standards. The widespread re-aging practice among card issuers also delayed the recognition of the problem, allowing excessive accumulation of risk during the lending boom phase.

7. The Korean government intervened in the crisis through providing liquidity support to the financial market and arranging a controversial rescue of the failing LG Card. The rescue was large-scale, involving the state-owned Korean Development Bank (KDB) lending to LG Card, ensuring the joint control of LG Card by the creditor banks, and eventually coordinating a debt-equity swap to wipe out the majority shareholders' equity and substantially reduce the minority shareholders'.

8. The Korean credit card crisis highlighted the role of excessive cash advances in affecting asset quality. The findings showed that higher levels of cash advances, especially those lagged two and three quarters, were major determinants of the quality of credit card assets.

9. The Korean credit card crisis had significant effects on the financial system, causing a contraction in credit card receivables and heavy losses for card issuers. The crisis was most spectacular in Korea, with credit card balances equivalent to as much as one-fifth of total bank loans outstanding at the peak of the boom.

10. The unwinding of the earlier excess lending in Korea sometimes intertwined with ongoing local business down cycles. The crisis led to a credit crunch and a prolonged downturn in private consumption in 2003. In contrast, credit card woes in Hong Kong were overshadowed by the protracted local asset price deflation at the time.

11. The Korean experience underscores the importance of policymakers focusing on detecting early warning signs before imbalances build up excessively for too long. It is crucial to recognize that a benign economic environment does not guarantee the absence of a consumer debt crisis. Policymakers need to strengthen their capacity for on-site examinations and maintain access to confidential information, particularly during market development transitions.

12. Governments can assist in enhancing information flows in the consumer credit market by encouraging credit information reporting and sharing. This facilitates the functioning of the market and helps mitigate information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers.

13. Policymakers may benefit from upgrading their prudential and supervisory frameworks, especially during the liberalization process. This includes refining and differentiating provisioning requirements for credit card receivables, setting capital requirements as a cushion for off-balance sheet securitization, and imposing restrictions like income tests, credit limits, and minimum repayment requirements to enhance financial stability.

1. 近年来，亚洲消费者信贷的增长显著，部分原因是美国家庭债务过多和全球金融动荡。亚洲信用卡持有量和贷款额并未总是平滑地达到成熟市场的水平。这在一定程度上是由于信用卡发行商在加剧的市场竞争中放宽了筛选和贷款标准。市场纪律的失败也是一个问题，债券市场未能充分定价信贷风险，直到危机全面爆发。

2. 韩国2003年的信用卡危机中，一个关键问题是信用卡现金借款水平如何影响信用卡贷款组合的质量。研究发现，较高的现金借款确实损害了资产质量。

3. 其他亚洲国家的政策制定者已经注意到了亚洲这三个信用卡贷款困境的教训，并相应地采取了措施来应对风险，包括加强早期预警信号的检测、增强信息流通以及升级审慎和监管框架。

4. 政策制定者通过政府政策缓解亚洲金融危机后经济衰退的影响，导致信用卡借贷激增。然而，税激励的作用被夸大了，因为大部分增加的信用卡支出可能是现金支出的简单替代品。危机也涉及市场纪律的失败，债券市场未能在卡公司投资组合质量恶化时合理定价。

5. 韩国信用卡危机中，债券市场未能充分定价卡公司的信贷风险，直到全面危机爆发。这种做法鼓励了银行激进的资产负债表扩张。市场纪律的失败可以归因于信息不对称、监管机构迟缓的信息披露以及复杂和不透明的ABS交易。缺乏有效的市场纪律是一种市场失灵的情况。

6. 韩国信用卡危机受到依赖批发融资的信用卡业务模式的影响。这种模式类似于一种发起和分发类型，可能鼓励监管套利和宽松的放贷标准。信用卡发行商普遍采用的再老化实践也延迟了问题的识别，允许风险在贷款繁荣阶段过度积累。

7. 韩国政府通过向金融市场提供流动性支持和安排LG卡的争议性救援介入危机。这包括韩国开发银行（KDB）对LG卡的贷款、确保债权人银行控制LG卡，并最终协调了一项债务-股权交换，使得债权人银行记录了3万亿韩元的会计利润。

8. 韩国信用卡危机强调了在信贷过度增长过长之前，政策制定者重视检测早期预警信号的重要性。需要认识到，在良好的经济环境下，不会保证没有消费者债务危机。政策制定者需要加强现场检查能力并保持机密信息访问权，尤其是在市场发展转型期间。

9. 政府可以通过鼓励信用信息报告和共享来帮助增强消费者信贷市场的信息流通。这有助于缓解放贷者与借款人之间的信息不对称，促进市场的正常运作。

10. 政策制定者可以从改善审慎和监管框架中受益，尤其是在自由化过程中。这包括细化和差异化信用卡应收账款的拨备要求、设定针对或有负债证券的资本要求、实施如收入测试、信贷限额和最低还款要求等限制措施以增强金融稳定性。
