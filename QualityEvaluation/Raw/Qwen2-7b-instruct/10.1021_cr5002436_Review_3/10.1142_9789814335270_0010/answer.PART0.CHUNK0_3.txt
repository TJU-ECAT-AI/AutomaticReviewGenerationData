The factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation include easy monetary conditions, financial liberalization, economies of scale in the credit card business, limited information reporting and sharing, various forms of principal-agent problems, and the seasoning effect of a rapidly growing lending portfolio. These factors contributed to unsustainable credit lending booms. Excessive indebtedness led to rising credit costs, tighter lending standards, reduced credit availability, increased credit losses, large balance sheet adjustments, risks to the financial system, and economic damage. Policymakers in Asian emerging markets, such as China and India, need to understand the risks associated with consumer lending and implement enhanced supervisory measures, improved market infrastructure, and appropriate prudential regulations to mitigate these risks.

探索以二氧化钒为基催化剂作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的原因包括宽松的货币政策、金融自由化、信用卡业务的规模经济、有限的信息报告与共享、代理问题的多种形式以及快速增长的贷款组合的成熟效应。这些因素导致了不稳定的信用贷款泡沫。过度的负债最终导致了信贷成本上升、收紧的信贷标准、信贷规模收缩、进一步的信贷损失、大规模资产负债表调整、金融系统风险以及经济损害。亚洲新兴市场，如中国和印度的政策制定者需要理解消费者信贷的风险，并采取加强监管能力、改善市场基础设施和实施适当的审慎措施来减轻这些风险。
