[1] "Against a background of the excessive US household indebtedness and ongoing global financial turmoil, consumer credit in Asia has grown significantly in recent years."
[2] "Easy monetary conditions, financial liberalization, economies of scales in the credit card business, limited information reporting and sharing, various forms of the principal-agent problem, and the seasoning effect of a fast-growing lending portfolio all contributed to unsustainable credit lending boom."
[3] "Eventually, excessive indebtedness led to rising credit cost and tighter lending standard, contracting credit, further credit loss,big balance sheet adjustments, risks to the financial system and damages to the economy."
[4] "Of the episodes in Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan during the 2000s, Korea experienced the most serious boom-bust cycle in 2003."
[5] "In a search for yield, pension funds and insurance companies also took sizable exposure to credit card companies."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to reduce costs and environmental impacts associated with traditional catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on optimizing the properties of vanadium species within the catalysts. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading play crucial roles in determining the behavior and efficiency of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors influence the structure and activity of the catalysts, affecting the conversion of paraffins to olefins during the dehydrogenation process.

2. The factors that have contributed to the unsustainable credit lending boom in Asia, particularly in the context of the Korean credit card market, include easy monetary conditions, financial liberalization, economies of scale in the credit card business, limited information reporting and sharing, various forms of the principal-agent problem, and the seasoning effect of a fast-growing lending portfolio. These factors collectively led to a relaxation of lending standards, excessive growth in credit card lending, and a subsequent boom-bust cycle characterized by rising credit costs, tightened lending standards, contracting credit, increased credit loss, significant balance sheet adjustments, heightened risks to the financial system, and economic damages.

3. Excessive indebtedness played a pivotal role in exacerbating the Korean credit card crisis. As credit card debt accumulated, it led to higher credit costs, tighter lending standards, and a contraction of credit availability. This, in turn, resulted in further credit loss, large balance sheet adjustments, increased risks to the financial system, and economic downturns. The situation was exacerbated by the collapse of the asset quality of credit card portfolios, leading to a scenario akin to a credit crunch where credit contraction and deterioration in asset quality reinforced each other.

4. The role of cash advances in the credit card asset quality of the Korean credit card market was significant. The study found strong evidence that higher levels of cash advances, particularly those lagged two and three quarters, were major determinants of the quality of credit card assets. This suggests that excessive cash lending and the deliberate targeting of the less creditworthy segment of the market by credit card companies led to riskier card portfolios, poorer asset quality, and eventual credit losses. The seasoning effect in credit card lending might have initially boosted earnings for issuers, but higher levels of cash advances increased the riskiness of the card portfolio.

5. Policymakers should focus on detecting early warning signs of imbalances building up excessively for too long before they reach critical levels. It is challenging to sound the alarm when profits are on the rise during a lending boom. However, reasonable average debt-to-GDP or liability-to-asset ratios and low initial losses should not lead to complacency. Policymakers need to strengthen their capacity to recognize problems early, especially during periods of structural change and economic prosperity, to prevent potential crises.

6. Enhancing information flows to facilitate the functioning of the consumer credit market is essential. This includes encouraging credit information reporting and sharing to mitigate information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers. Following the recent episodes of distress, credit reporting and sharing in both Hong Kong and Korea have improved considerably. The implementation of a central consumer credit information service that provides both negative and positive credit data in Hong Kong and the refinement and enhancement of the local system in Taiwan demonstrate the importance of maintaining robust and comprehensive credit reporting systems.

7. Upgrading prudential and supervisory frameworks is necessary, particularly during the liberalization process. This includes refining and differentiating provisioning requirements for credit card receivables, implementing explicit capital requirements for retained exposure or contingent liabilities arising from off-balance sheet securitization, and imposing restrictions on income tests, credit limits, and minimum repayment requirements. These restrictions, when deployed preemptively or sufficiently early, can enhance financial stability and mitigate risks associated with consumer lending.

8. The challenges in managing credit card lending crises highlight the importance of proactive policymaking and the need for continuous improvement in prudential regulations. The experiences from the Korean credit card crisis have led to the introduction of formal guidelines on credit card operations, such as setting minimum annual income requirements, credit limits, and minimum monthly repayment requirements, in countries like Thailand and Indonesia. These measures aim to mitigate risks and prevent future crises by ensuring a more balanced and sustainable growth of credit card lending.

1. 随着对铂金(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)等传统催化剂成本和环境影响的减少的需求，对钒氧化物基催化剂作为替代品的研究已显著增加，用于石蜡脱氢。自1980年代以来，这一领域研究的发展集中在优化催化剂中的钒物种属性上。载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量在决定催化剂中钒物种的行为和效率方面起着关键作用。这些因素影响催化结构和活性，影响石蜡在脱氢过程中转化为烯烃的过程。

2. 近年来亚洲消费者信贷的快速增长，特别是在韩国信用卡市场的危机中，是由宽松的货币政策、金融自由化、信用卡业务的规模经济、有限的信息报告与共享、代理问题的多种形式以及快速增长贷款组合的季节效应共同推动的。这些因素导致了放贷标准的放松、信用卡贷款的过度增长，并引发了一波又一波的危机，表现为信贷成本上升、放贷标准收紧、信贷紧缩、信用损失增加、大量资产负债表调整、金融系统风险增加和经济损害。

3. 过度负债加剧了韩国信用卡危机。随着信用卡债务的积累，它导致了更高的信贷成本、更严格的放贷标准和信贷供给的收缩。这反过来导致了进一步的信用损失、大规模资产负债表调整、金融系统风险增加和经济衰退。资产质量的崩溃是这种情况的关键因素，导致了一种类似于信贷紧缩的状况，其中信贷紧缩和资产质量恶化相互强化。

4. 韩国信用卡市场中现金借款对资产质量的影响是显著的。研究发现，特别滞后两季度和三个季度的高额现金借款是信用卡资产质量的主要决定因素。这表明，过度的现金借贷和信用卡公司对较不信用客户群的故意目标定位导致了风险较高的信用卡组合、较低的资产质量和最终的信贷损失。信贷卡贷款的“调味”效应可能最初提高了发行商的收益，但较高的现金借款水平增加了信用卡组合的风险性。

5. 政府应关注在过长的时间内累积过多不平衡的早期预警信号，在利润上升的时期发出警报是一个挑战。然而，合理的平均债务/GDP或负债/总资产比率和初始较低的损失不应导致自满。政府需要加强其能力，以尽早识别问题，特别是在结构性变化和经济繁荣期间，以防止潜在的危机。

6. 增强信用市场信息流通，促进信用信息报告与共享，对于缓解放贷者与借款人之间的信息不对称至关重要。从最近的困境事件中，香港和韩国的信用报告和共享有了显著改进。香港实施了一个提供负面和正面信用数据的中央消费者信用信息服务，而台湾对本地系统的改进和增强则强调了保持强大和全面信用报告系统的重要性。

7. 在金融自由化进程期间，升级审慎和监管框架是必要的。这包括细化为信用卡应收账款制定的拨备要求，实施保留暴露或与离散账簿证券化相关的潜在负债的明确资本要求，以及对收入测试、信用限额和最低还款要求的限制。当这些限制在提前部署或足够早时被实施时，它们可以增强金融稳定性和减轻与消费者贷款相关风险。

8. 管理信用卡贷款危机的挑战突显了前瞻性的政策制定和持续改进审慎法规的重要性。韩国信用卡危机的经验导致泰国和印尼等国家引入了关于信用卡操作的正式指导方针，如设定最低年度收入要求、信用限额和最低月度还款要求。这些措施旨在通过确保信用卡贷款的平衡和可持续增长来减轻风险。
