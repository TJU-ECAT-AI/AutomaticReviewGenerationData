         The chemical state of gallium in working alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts involves Ga species initially present in fresh catalysts that reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. Reduced Ga is present in a highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, likely as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, indicating that active forms of Ga exist only under reaction conditions.

         在工作中的烷烃脱氢二聚化催化剂中，镓的化学状态涉及新鲜催化剂中存在的Ga物种，在770 K以下温度下通过氢处理或丙烷反应期间还原。还原的Ga以高度分散的形式存在，没有Ga近邻，可能是一种单核氢化物物种，与沸石通道内的基本氧基配位。这些氢化物物种由于在H-ZSM5上进行丙烷脱氢二聚化时表面氢分压的提高而释放分子氢。当样品在流动的H2中冷却至室温时，还原的Ga物种重新氧化为Ga+3，表明只有在反应条件下才存在活性的Ga形式。
