What factors have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how has research in this area evolved since the 1980s, and how do variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts?

Regular Article The Chemical State of Gallium in Working Alkane Dehydrocyclodimerization Catalysts. In situ Gallium K-Edge X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Abstract Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics. Specifically, they promote the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and thus inhibit undesired cracking reactions. Here, we describe studies of the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge.
Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions.
Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels.
These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5.
Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.
This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites.

The chemical state of gallium in working alkane dehydrocyclodimerization catalysts was studied using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge. Initially present as Ga+3 species, gallium reduces at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions. The reduced gallium is present in a highly dispersed form, likely as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These hydride species release molecular hydrogen due to high surface hydrogen fugacities during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Reduced gallium species reoxidize to Ga+3 upon cooling to room temperature in flowing H2, indicating that active gallium forms exist solely under reaction conditions.

在工作烷烃脱氢二聚化催化剂中，通过Ga K-边X射线吸收原位技术研究了镓的化学状态。初始存在的Ga+3物种在低于770 K的温度下，在氢预处理或丙烷反应期间还原。还原的镓以高度分散的形式存在，可能是一种单体氢化物物种，与沸石通道中的基本氧基配位。这些氢化物物种由于在H-ZSM5上进行丙烷脱氢二聚化时表面氢分压的增加而释放分子氢。在冷却至室温并流过H2时，还原的镓物种重新氧化为Ga+3，表明仅在反应条件下存在活性镓形式。

在工作中的烷烃脱氢二聚化催化剂中，镓的化学状态涉及新鲜催化剂中存在的Ga物种，在770 K以下温度下通过氢处理或丙烷反应期间还原。还原的Ga以高度分散的形式存在，没有Ga近邻，可能是一种单核氢化物物种，与沸石通道内的基本氧基配位。这些氢化物物种由于在H-ZSM5上进行丙烷脱氢二聚化时表面氢分压的提高而释放分子氢。当样品在流动的H2中冷却至室温时，还原的Ga物种重新氧化为Ga+3，表明只有在反应条件下才存在活性的Ga形式。这项研究强调了原位技术对于理解催化位点的化学形式的重要性，并避免仅基于反应前后表征得出误导性结论。
