Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O.
Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm.
Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

Catalyst stability is further enhanced by using a metal oxide support free of acid sites that can promote carbon deposition through polymerization of the product alkene.
Recent work has shown that calcined hydrotalcite-like materials, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are ideal for this purpose.
Moreover, the Al cations present at the support surface help stabilize the dispersed metal particles against sintering.

Metal oxide supports free of acid sites, such as Mg(Al)O, enhance catalyst stability by preventing carbon deposition via the polymerization of the product alkene. Calcined hydrotalcite-like materials, specifically Mg(Al)O, are optimal for this application. Additionally, the Al ions at the support surface aid in stabilizing the dispersed metal particles against sintering.
