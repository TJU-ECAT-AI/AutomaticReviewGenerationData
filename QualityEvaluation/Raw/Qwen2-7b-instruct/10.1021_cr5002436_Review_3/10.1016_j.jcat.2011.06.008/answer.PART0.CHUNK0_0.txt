Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

The Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts were prepared by dispersing Pt on a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium. Upon reduction, bimetallic PtIn particles with an average diameter of 1 nm were observed. The In content of these particles increased with higher bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In.

<quotes>
The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The combination of In with Pt leads to a notable reduction in carbon buildup during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation processes. The rate of carbon accumulation decreases most markedly as the overall In/Pt ratio goes from 0 to 0.48, and the decrease becomes slower for higher In/Pt ratios.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon primarily deposits on the support. In contrast, during propane dehydrogenation, some of the carbon also deposits on the PtIn nanoparticles.
