Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm. Analysis of Pt LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data shows that the In content of the bimetallic particles increases with increasing bulk In/Pt ratio and reduction temperature.

The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts' activities for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are highly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the highest activity is reached at a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, which corresponds to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities towards ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. Incorporating In with Pt results in a significant reduction of carbon accumulation during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation.
