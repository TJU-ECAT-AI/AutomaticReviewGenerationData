Novel Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O. Upon reduction in H2 at temperatures above 673 K, bimetallic particles of PtIn are observed by TEM, which have an average diameter of 1 nm.

The activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al) catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48. The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation began in the 1980s. Since then, research has focused on understanding how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Key factors influencing the effectiveness of vanadium oxide catalysts include the precise control of vanadium oxidation state, the role of the carrier in facilitating vanadium redox reactions, and the impact of metal loading on the dispersion and stability of vanadium species. Studies have shown that optimizing these parameters can significantly enhance the catalytic performance of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.
