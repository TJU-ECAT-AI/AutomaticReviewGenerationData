[1] "Two types of catalyst are currently used in the commercial dehydrogenation processes of isobutane: supported chromium oxide and supported platinum metal [1,2]."
[2] "However, several drawbacks are associated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic."
[3] "The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates."
[4] "Since their development several decades ago, silicon carbide materials have been used in a broad range of applications [3] that exploit their high thermal conductivity, high resistance to oxidation, considerable chemical inertness and good mechanical strength."
[5] "Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins [9,10]."
[6] "The catalytic activity was also compared with activities obtained on corresponding silica and alumina supported catalysts."
[7] "The addition of molybdenum oxide on alumina did not significantly change the surface area based on the area calculated as weight fraction of the support, but on silica, the surface area decreased by about half the original value, indicating the blockage of some pores."
[8] "The TPO spectra of the catalyst after 30 min and 1, 3 and 5 h of reaction (Fig. 6) show the presence of carbon atoms in different forms on the catalyst."
[9] "It is interesting to observe that the formation of carbon monoxide closely followed that of methane (Fig. 8), and in both cases, formation depended on the amount of water present."
[10] "Selectivity for dehydrogenation was best with the SiC supported catalyst."

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of chromium oxide and platinum catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate quickly and require frequent regeneration, with a carcinogenic part of chromium remaining after regeneration. Platinum catalysts are sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.

2. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with the focus shifting to catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and require minimal maintenance. The exploration includes the development of new catalyst supports and the optimization of metal loading and surface area to enhance activity and selectivity.

3. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The carrier type determines the physical properties of the catalyst, such as thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. The support surface area affects the accessibility of reactants to the active sites, while metal loading impacts the concentration of active vanadium species.

4. The presence of both hydrogen and water is required for the formation of the active phase in vanadium oxide-based catalysts, which is likely composed of vanadium oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.

5. The selectivity for dehydrogenation is higher on catalysts supported on silicon carbide (SiC) compared to those on silica or alumina. This suggests that the choice of support plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity.

6. The stability of the catalyst is influenced by the presence of steam in the reactant feed, which preserves the oxygen balance on the surface phase and prevents significant deactivation.

1. 针对异丁烷脱氢过程，采用氧化钨基催化剂作为铂和CrOx的替代品，其探索是基于铬氧化物和铂催化剂的缺点。铬氧化物催化剂快速失活且需要频繁再生，再生后部分铬以致癌的Cr6+状态存在。铂催化剂必须与添加剂结合使用，并且对进料中的水分和氧代物高度敏感。

2. 自上世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究已经发展，重点转向那些能够承受苛刻条件且维护需求最少的催化剂。研究包括新催化剂载体的开发以及优化金属负载和表面积以增强活性和选择性的优化。

3. 载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等变量影响这些催化剂中钨物种的性质和行为。载体类型决定了催化剂的物理特性，如热导率和机械强度。支持表面面积影响反应物到达活性位点的可及性，而金属负载影响活性钨物种的浓度。

4. 形成活性相在钨氧化物基催化剂中需要氢气和水的存在，这可能由改性碳并限制在催化剂最上层的还原钨氧化物组成。

5. 相对于二氧化硅或氧化铝支持的催化剂，硅碳化物（SiC）支持的催化剂的脱氢选择性更高。这表明选择性支持对于确定催化活性和选择性起着关键作用。

6. 催化剂的稳定性受反应物流中蒸汽的存在影响，蒸汽保持表面相上的氧平衡，防止显著的活性丧失。
