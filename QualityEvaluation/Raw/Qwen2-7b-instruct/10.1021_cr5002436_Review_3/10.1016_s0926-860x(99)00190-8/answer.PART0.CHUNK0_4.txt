[1] "For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst systems."
[2] "Two types of catalyst are currently used in the commercial dehydrogenation processes of isobutane: supported chromium oxide and supported platinum metal [1,2]."
[3] "Since their development several decades ago, silicon carbide materials have been used in a broad range of applications [3] that exploit their high thermal conductivity, high resistance to oxidation, considerable chemical inertness and good mechanical strength."
[4] "In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions."
[5] "Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[6] "The active phase in dehydrogenation was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst."
[7] "The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the most active and stable phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst."
[8] "The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase),which resulted in a non-selective catalyst [12]."

1. Thermodynamic considerations necessitate conducting dehydrogenation at high temperatures, which sets forth specific demands for catalyst systems.
2. Currently, commercial dehydrogenation processes for isobutane utilize supported chromium oxide and supported platinum metal catalysts.
3. Silicon carbide materials have been employed in diverse applications due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and mechanical strength.
4. Earlier studies demonstrated that unsupported molybdenum oxide modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, albeit with instability under required reaction conditions.
5. Molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation.
6. The active phase involved in dehydrogenation comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.
7. The formation of the most active and stable phase necessitates the presence of both hydrogen and steam, which is believed to consist of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and situated on the catalyst's uppermost layer.
8. The active phase on the silica-supported catalyst potentially contains more carbon (carbide-like phase), leading to a non-selective catalyst.
