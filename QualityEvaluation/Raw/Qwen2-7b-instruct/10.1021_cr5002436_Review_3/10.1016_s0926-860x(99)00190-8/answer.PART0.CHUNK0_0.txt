The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. The development of silicon carbide (SiC) materials has shown promise in various applications, including catalytic processes due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and good mechanical strength. These properties, combined with their ability to be prepared with high surface area, make SiC a suitable candidate for use as a catalyst support.

Research has indicated that molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. This is advantageous compared to chromium oxide catalysts, which deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, often leaving carcinogenic Cr6+ ions after regeneration. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.

The active phase in dehydrogenation consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is crucial for the formation of this active phase. This phase likely comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity observed in this catalyst system. The surface area of the support, metal loading, and carrier type influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the current performance of the system is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium under the tested conditions. Further improvements are needed for it to be ready for industrial use.

自1980年代以来，对钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究已经发展起来。硅酸盐材料的发展在各种应用中显示出前景，尤其是催化过程，由于其高热导率、抗氧化性、化学惰性和良好的机械强度，这些特性以及它们能够以高表面积制备，使SiC成为合适的催化剂载体。

研究表明，钼氧化物支持在SiC上是n-丁烷脱氢活性和稳定的催化剂。与快速失活且需要频繁再生的铬氧化物催化剂相比，这一发现具有优势。再生后，部分铬会变成致癌的Cr6+离子。铂催化剂需要添加剂，并且对进料中的水和氧代物等杂质高度敏感。

脱氢作用的活性相由钼氧化物与碳改性的组成，并局限于催化剂的最上层。形成这种活性相需要氢气和蒸汽的存在。该相可能包含钼氧化物与碳改性，并负责观察到的催化剂系统中的高脱氢活性和选择性。支持表面面积、金属负载和载体类型影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。然而，在测试条件下，该系统的性能受到热力学平衡的限制。为了使其准备好用于工业使用，还需要进一步改进。
