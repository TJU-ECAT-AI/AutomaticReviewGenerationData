          "[1] For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst systems.
          [2] However, several drawbacks are associated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.
          [3] The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.
          [4] Already, molybdenum oxides supported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins.
          [5] In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac- tion conditions.
          [6] Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane.
          [7] The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the active phase, which probably was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.
          [8] The active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase), which resulted in a non-selective catalyst."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. The development of silicon carbide (SiC) materials has shown promise in various applications, including catalytic processes due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and good mechanical strength. These properties, combined with their ability to be prepared with high surface area, make SiC a suitable candidate for use as a catalyst support.

          Research has indicated that molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. This is advantageous compared to chromium oxide catalysts, which deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, often leaving carcinogenic Cr6+ ions after regeneration. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.

          The active phase in dehydrogenation consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is crucial for the formation of this active phase. This phase likely comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity observed in this catalyst system. The surface area of the support, metal loading, and carrier type influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the current performance of the system is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium under the tested conditions. Further improvements are needed for it to be ready for industrial use.

          Earlier studies showed that unsupported molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) modified with carbon exhibits high initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane but is unstable under the required reaction conditions. In contrast, molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is identified as an active and stable catalyst for n-butane dehydrogenation. The active phase involves molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is necessary for the formation of this active phase, which likely consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is located on the catalyst's uppermost layer. The active phase on the silica-supported catalyst might contain more carbon (carbide-like phase), resulting in a non-selective catalyst.

          自1980年代以来，对以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究已经发展起来。硅酸盐材料的发展在各种应用中显示出前景，尤其是催化过程，由于其高热导率、抗氧化性、化学惰性和良好的机械强度，这些特性以及它们能够以高表面积制备，使SiC成为合适的催化剂载体。

          研究表明，钼酸盐支持在SiC上是用于丁烷脱氢的活性且稳定的催化剂。与快速失活且需要频繁再生的铬氧化物催化剂相比，这一发现具有优势。再生后，部分铬会变成致癌的Cr6+离子。另一方面，铂催化剂需要添加剂，并且对进料中的水和氧代物等杂质高度敏感。

          脱氢作用的活性相由钼酸盐与碳化物复合并局限于催化剂的最上层组成。形成这种活性相需要氢气和蒸汽的共同存在。这一相可能包含钼酸盐与碳化物复合，并且是导致观察到的高脱氢活性和选择性的催化剂系统的原因。支持表面面积、金属负载和载体类型影响这些催化剂中五氧化二钒物种的性质和行为。然而，在测试条件下，该系统的当前表现受限于热力学平衡。为了使其准备好用于工业使用，还需要进一步改进。

          早期研究显示，未支持的钼酸三氧化物（MoO3）通过碳化处理在丁烷脱氢中表现出高初始活性，但不稳定于所需反应条件。相比之下，钼酸盐支持在SiC上被识别为用于丁烷脱氢的活性且稳定的催化剂。活性相由钼酸盐与碳化物复合并局限在催化剂的最上层组成。形成这种活性相需要氢气和蒸汽的共同存在，这一相可能包含钼酸盐与碳化物复合，并且位于催化剂的最上层。在硅酸盐支持体上的活性相可能包含更多的碳（类似石墨相），导致选择性较差的催化剂。

          Several drawbacks are associated with chromium oxide and platinum catalysts used for paraffin dehydrogenation. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, and a part of the regenerated chromium is in the carcinogenic oxidation state Cr6+. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as traces of water and oxygenates.

          Since the 1980s, research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly. The focus has been on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

          Silicon carbide materials have been widely utilized in various applications due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and mechanical strength. Their use in catalysis exploits these properties.

          Molybdenum oxide supported on silicon carbide (SiC) has demonstrated significant activity in the isomerization of n-paraffins. This suggests that the SiC support enhances the catalytic performance of molybdenum oxide.

          In the context of dehydrogenation, the active phase was found to consist of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon, confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is critical for the formation of the most active and stable phase, which is likely composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.

          Among the catalysts tested, those supported on SiC showed the best selectivity for dehydrogenation. This indicates that the SiC support facilitates the optimal formation of the active dehydrogenation catalyst phase.

          在硅碳化物（SiC）上支持的钼氧化物在正构烷烃异构化中显示了显著的活性。这表明SiC支持可以增强钼氧化物的催化性能。

          在脱氢过程中，活性相被发现由钼氧化物与碳化物复合并局限于催化剂的最上层组成。形成最活跃且稳定的相需要氢气和蒸汽的共同存在，这可能是由钼氧化物与碳化物复合并局限于催化剂最上层组成的。

          在测试的催化剂中，SiC支持的催化剂显示出最佳的脱氢选择性。这表明SiC支持促进了活性脱氢催化剂相的最优形成。
