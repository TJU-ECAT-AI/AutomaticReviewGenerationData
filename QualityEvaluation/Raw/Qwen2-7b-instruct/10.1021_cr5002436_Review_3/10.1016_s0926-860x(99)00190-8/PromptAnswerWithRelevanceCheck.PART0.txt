The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s. The development of silicon carbide (SiC) materials has shown promise in various applications, including catalytic processes due to their high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, chemical inertness, and good mechanical strength. These properties, combined with their ability to be prepared with high surface area, make SiC a suitable candidate for use as a catalyst support.

Research has indicated that molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. This is advantageous compared to chromium oxide catalysts, which deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration, often leaving carcinogenic Cr6+ ions after regeneration. Platinum catalysts, on the other hand, need additives and are highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.

The active phase in dehydrogenation consists of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and confined to the uppermost layer of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and steam is crucial for the formation of this active phase. This phase likely comprises molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and is responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity observed in this catalyst system. The surface area of the support, metal loading, and carrier type influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the current performance of the system is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium under the tested conditions. Further improvements are needed for it to be ready for industrial use.

自1980年代以来，对钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究已经发展起来。硅酸盐材料的发展在各种应用中显示出前景，尤其是催化过程，由于其高热导率、抗氧化性、化学惰性和良好的机械强度，这些特性以及它们能够以高表面积制备，使SiC成为合适的催化剂载体。

研究表明，钼氧化物支持在SiC上是n-丁烷脱氢活性和稳定的催化剂。与快速失活且需要频繁再生的铬氧化物催化剂相比，这一发现具有优势。再生后，部分铬会变成致癌的Cr6+离子。铂催化剂需要添加剂，并且对进料中的水和氧代物等杂质高度敏感。

脱氢作用的活性相由钼氧化物与碳改性的组成，并局限于催化剂的最上层。形成这种活性相需要氢气和蒸汽的存在。该相可能包含钼氧化物与碳改性，并负责观察到的催化剂系统中的高脱氢活性和选择性。支持表面面积、金属负载和载体类型影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。然而，在测试条件下，该系统的性能受到热力学平衡的限制。为了使其准备好用于工业使用，还需要进一步改进。

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Key factors driving this exploration include the desire to find more environmentally friendly and less toxic alternatives. The drawbacks of chromium oxide catalysts, such as rapid deactivation and the carcinogenic byproduct Cr6+, have motivated the search for alternatives. Research has focused on modifying the structure of vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly by controlling the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading, to enhance the stability and activity of vanadium species. For instance, the use of silicon carbide (SiC) as a support has been shown to improve the stability and selectivity of the catalyst compared to alumina or silica. Additionally, the interaction between vanadium species and the support plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's behavior, affecting the reduction conditions required to form the active phase. This active phase, often characterized by reduced vanadium oxide modified with carbon and localized at the top layer of the catalyst, exhibits superior dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

自20世纪80年代以来，对以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究取得了显著进展。这一探索的主要驱动因素是寻找更环保且毒性较小的替代方案。铬氧化物催化剂的快速失活和致癌副产品Cr6+的存在促使寻找替代品。研究重点在于通过控制载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等参数来改进五氧化二钒催化剂的结构，以增强五氧化二钒物种的稳定性和活性。例如，使用硅碳（SiC）作为支撑材料已被证明可以提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性，与之相比，使用氧化铝或二氧化硅则效果较差。此外，五氧化二钒物种与支撑材料之间的相互作用对催化剂的行为起着关键作用，决定了形成活性相所需的还原条件。这种活性相通常由局部在催化剂顶部层的还原五氧化二钒与碳改性的相组成，表现出优异的脱氢活性和选择性。

1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the drawbacks of chromium oxide and platinum catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate quickly and require frequent regeneration, with a carcinogenic part of chromium remaining after regeneration. Platinum catalysts are sensitive to impurities in the feed, such as water and oxygenates.

2. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with the focus shifting to catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and require minimal maintenance. The exploration includes the development of new catalyst supports and the optimization of metal loading and surface area to enhance activity and selectivity.

3. Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The carrier type determines the physical properties of the catalyst, such as thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. The support surface area affects the accessibility of reactants to the active sites, while metal loading impacts the concentration of active vanadium species.

4. The presence of both hydrogen and water is required for the formation of the active phase in vanadium oxide-based catalysts, which is likely composed of vanadium oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst.

5. The selectivity for dehydrogenation is higher on catalysts supported on silicon carbide (SiC) compared to those on silica or alumina. This suggests that the choice of support plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity.

6. The stability of the catalyst is influenced by the presence of steam in the reactant feed, which preserves the oxygen balance on the surface phase and prevents significant deactivation.
