[1] "For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst systems."
[2] "However, several drawbacks are associated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regeneration. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic."
[3] "On the silica support, Mo species were reduced at 530C and 730C, but on SiC at higher temperatures."
[4] "The presence of both hydrogen and steam was required for the formation of the most active and stable phase, and the amount of steam was critical."
[5] "The active molybdenum phase was probably composed of reduced molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the catalyst."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Key factors driving this exploration include the desire to find more environmentally friendly and less toxic alternatives. The drawbacks of chromium oxide catalysts, such as rapid deactivation and the carcinogenic byproduct Cr6+, have motivated the search for alternatives. Research has focused on modifying the structure of vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly by controlling the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading, to enhance the stability and activity of vanadium species. For instance, the use of silicon carbide (SiC) as a support has been shown to improve the stability and selectivity of the catalyst compared to alumina or silica. Additionally, the interaction between vanadium species and the support plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's behavior, affecting the reduction conditions required to form the active phase. This active phase, often characterized by reduced vanadium oxide modified with carbon and localized at the top layer of the catalyst, exhibits superior dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

自20世纪80年代以来，对以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究取得了显著进展。这一探索的主要驱动因素是寻找更环保且毒性较小的替代方案。铬氧化物催化剂的快速失活和致癌副产品Cr6+的存在促使寻找替代品。研究重点在于通过控制载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等参数来改进五氧化二钒催化剂的结构，以增强五氧化二钒物种的稳定性和活性。例如，使用硅碳（SiC）作为支撑材料已被证明可以提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性，与之相比，使用氧化铝或二氧化硅则效果较差。此外，五氧化二钒物种与支撑材料之间的相互作用对催化剂的行为起着关键作用，决定了形成活性相所需的还原条件。这种活性相通常由局部在催化剂顶部层的还原五氧化二钒与碳改性的相组成，表现出优异的脱氢活性和选择性。
