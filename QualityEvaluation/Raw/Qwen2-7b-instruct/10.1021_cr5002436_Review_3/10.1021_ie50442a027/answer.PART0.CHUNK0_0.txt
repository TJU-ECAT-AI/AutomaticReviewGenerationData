1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding the relationship between carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, particularly regarding how these factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts.

2. The surface area of the adsorbent material plays a crucial role in determining the activity of catalysts for molybdena impregnated onto activated alumina. As the molybdena concentration increases, activity rises nearly linearly until a concentration dependent on the alumina area is reached. Beyond this value, additional molybdena does not further increase activity.

3. The relationship between surface area and catalyst activity is linear, with activity being dependent on the molybdena concentration. However, the rate of increase of activity slows down with further increases in surface area.

4. The maximum activity is achieved when the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdena. The activity is relatively insensitive to changes in particle size within the range of 2 to 20 mesh.

5. Carbon skeleton rearrangement occurs on a chromia-alumina catalyst, indicating the versatility of catalyst types in dehydrogenation processes.

6. The activated aluminas used in the study were products of the Aluminum Ore Company, with specific chemical compositions listed for the F and H series.

7. Molybdena was sourced as Baker's Analyzed ammonium molybdate with a purity of 83% MOO3 and minor impurities below 0.01%.

8. The n-heptane used in the study had a boiling point of 98.42°C and a freezing point of -90.65°C.

9. The coke deposited on the catalyst was determined by measuring the sum of carbon and hydrogen through combustion analysis, showing an approximate composition of CH.

10. The standard catalyst for comparison was found to have a reduction correction of 1.0 gram, and it was run at various feed rates for durations that ensured a consistent coke deposition.

11. Increasing the reduction temperature, hydrogen flow rate, or duration of reduction leads to higher activity levels, suggesting that a more complete reduction enhances catalytic efficiency.

12. Reproducibility of the results was demonstrated within a margin of 37% for TO and 2% yield for five tests conducted with the standard catalyst.
