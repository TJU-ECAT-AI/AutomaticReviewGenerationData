[1] "The development of a simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials (1) provided a basis for correlating information on the action of adsorbents in this application."
[2] "Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdena until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained."
[3] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
[4] "Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh."
[5] "The relationship between surface area and molybdena concentration was examined for molybdena impregnated onto activated alumina."
[6] "The calculated molybdena area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdena at maximum activity."

1. A straightforward technique for determining the surface areas of porous substances (1) laid the groundwork for linking adsorbent actions in applications involving such materials.
2. The catalytic activity rose almost proportionally with the addition of molybdenum until a concentration tied to the alumina surface area was reached.
3. Beyond a certain point, increasing the surface area resulted in a notably slower rise in activity.
4. Changes in catalyst particle size from 2 to 20 mesh did not significantly impact activity levels.
5. The interaction between surface area and molybdenum concentration was scrutinized in the context of molybdenum being applied to activated alumina.
6. The computed molybdenum area matched the experimental value for peak activity, indicating that the alumina surface was saturated with a monolayer of molybdenum at the highest level of effectiveness.

1. 一种简单的方法用于测量多孔材料的表面积（1），为理解吸附剂在应用中的作用提供了基础。
2. 添加钼后，催化活性几乎呈线性增长，直到达到依赖于氧化铝表面积的浓度为止。
3. 进一步增加表面积导致活动增长速度显著减缓。
4. 颗粒尺寸从2到20目之间变化，对活性水平的影响相对较小。
5. 在研究钼浸渍在活化氧化铝上的情况下，表面区域与钼浓度之间的关系受到了审视。
6. 计算出的钼面积与实验确定的最大活性值相匹配，表明在最大效能时，氧化铝表面被一层单分子层的钼覆盖。
