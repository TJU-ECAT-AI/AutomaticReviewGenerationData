[1] "The development of a simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials (1) provided a basis for correlating information on the action of adsorbents in this application."
[2] "Activated aluminas were impregnated with varying quantities of molybdenum and their catalytic activities determined for dehydrocyclization of n-heptane to toluene at atmospheric pressure."
[3] "Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained."
[4] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
[5] "Compari-son of the calculated molybdenum area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdenum at maximum activity."
[6] "Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh."

The research explored the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation. This area of study has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Variables including these parameters influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. The surface area of the support material significantly affects the catalytic activity, as the surface area correlates with the maximum activity level. The research also noted that the activity was insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range, indicating that the primary factor influencing activity was the impregnated area rather than the physical structure of the catalyst particles.

研究探索了使用钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬酸盐（CrOx）的替代品，用于烷烃脱氢。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展，重点放在载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等参数上。这些变量影响了催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。支持材料的表面积显著影响催化活性，表面面积与最大活性水平成正比。研究还指出，在指定范围内，活性对颗粒大小的变化不敏感，表明影响活性的主要因素是浸渍面积，而不是催化剂颗粒的物理结构。
