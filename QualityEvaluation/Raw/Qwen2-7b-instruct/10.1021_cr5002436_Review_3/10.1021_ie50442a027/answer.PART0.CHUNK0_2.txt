[1] "The develop-ment of a simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials (1) provided a basis for correlating information on the action of adsorbents in this application."
[2] "Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained."
[3] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
[4] "Comparison of the calculated molybdena area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdena at maximum activity."
[5] "Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh."
[6] "Surface areas were measured by the method of Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (I), employing the sorption of n-butane at 0' C."
[7] "To determine activity, it is convenient first to measure and graph TO produced by standard catalyst as a function of feed rate."
[8] "Results are expressed as the millimoles of n-butane which just cover the area of 1 gram of alumina in the sample (m.b./g.)."
[9] "In the range of molybdena concentrations and temperatures employed, the presence of reduced molybdena on the alumina does not change the area of the latter appreciably."
[10] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was determined as the sum of carbon plus hydrogen measured by combustion of a representative sample of the catalyst after the heptane run."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s, primarily focusing on factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Research has shown that the surface area of the support material plays a crucial role in determining the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Specifically, a linear relationship exists between the addition of molybdenum and the catalytic activity, until a concentration dependent on the alumina area is reached. Beyond this point, further increase in molybdenum loading does not lead to significant enhancements in activity. Moreover, the surface area of the catalyst is found to be critical, with a monolayer coverage of molybdenum observed at maximum activity. The activity of the catalyst is also relatively insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range. The measurement of surface area is performed using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, employing the sorption of n-butane at 0°C. The activity of the catalyst is determined by measuring the toluene production rate relative to a standard catalyst, allowing for the calculation of the catalyst's efficiency. Coke deposition on the catalyst is quantified by the sum of carbon and hydrogen measured through combustion analysis of a representative sample after the reaction.

自1980年代以来，对以钒氧化物为基的催化剂作为丙烷脱氢的替代品进行了大量研究，主要集中在载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等关键因素。研究表明，支持材料的表面积在决定催化剂活性和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。具体而言，在钼的添加量与催化活性之间存在线性关系，直到达到依赖于高岭土面积的浓度为止。在此之后，进一步增加钼的负载不会带来显著的活性提升。此外，发现表面面积对于催化剂至关重要，在最大活性时观察到单层钼覆盖。催化剂的活性也对颗粒大小的变化相对不敏感，特别是在指定范围内。通过使用Brunauer-Emmett-Teller（BET）方法，利用0°C的丁烷吸附来测量表面面积。催化剂的活性通过测量相对于标准催化剂的苯乙烯生成速率来确定，从而计算出催化剂的效率。通过燃烧分析代表样品中的焦炭沉积量来量化催化剂上的焦炭沉积，该分析是在反应后进行的。
