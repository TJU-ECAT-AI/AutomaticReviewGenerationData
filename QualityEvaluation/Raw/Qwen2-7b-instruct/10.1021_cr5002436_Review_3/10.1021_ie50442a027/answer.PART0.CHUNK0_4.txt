[1] "The development of a simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials (1) provided a basis for correlating information on the action of adsorbents in this application."
[2] "Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained."
[3] "Activity in creased linearly with surface area to a value dependent on the molybdenum concentration."
[4] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
[5] "The calculated molybdena area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdena at maximum activity."
[6] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was determined as the sum of carbon plus hydrogen measured by combustion of a representative sample of the catalyst after the heptane run."
[7] "Activity increases with increased reduction temperature to 500 O C. (hy- drogen flow rate 2 cubic feet per hour, duration 1.5 hours), with hydrogen flow rate to 1 cubic foot per hour (temperature 500" C., duration 1.5 hours), and with duration of reduction to I hour (temperature 500" C., flow rate 2 cubic feet per hour)."
[8] "The dependence of TO on feed rate is shown in Figure 2. The reaction has a high temperature coefficient, TO increasing roughly 0.870 per'"
[9] "Thus, to attain maximum activity, an alumina area of 0.090 m.b./g. is required for each increment of 0.01 in the atomic ratio on these samples."

1. A simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials provided a foundation for understanding the role of adsorbents in applications like catalysts.
2. The addition of molybdenum increased catalyst activity almost linearly until a concentration based on the alumina area was reached.
3. Activity rose linearly with surface area, depending on the molybdenum concentration.
4. Increasing the surface area led to a much slower increase in activity.
5. The calculated molybdena area matched the experimental value for maximum activity, indicating a monolayer of molybdena covered the alumina surface at peak activity.
6. Coke deposition was measured by combusting a catalyst sample post-heptane run.
7. Increased reduction temperature, hydrogen flow rate, and duration led to higher activity.
8. The reaction's temperature coefficient was high, causing TO to increase roughly 0.870 per degree Celsius.
9. For each 0.01 increment in the atomic ratio, 0.090 m.b./g. of alumina area was needed to achieve maximum activity.
10. The relationship between impregnated area and catalyst activity was linear when activated aluminas of different surface areas and molybdena amounts were tested.
