1. The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Research has focused on understanding the relationship between carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading, particularly regarding how these factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts.

2. The surface area of the adsorbent material plays a crucial role in determining the activity of catalysts for molybdena impregnated onto activated alumina. As the molybdena concentration increases, activity rises nearly linearly until a concentration dependent on the alumina area is reached. Beyond this value, additional molybdena does not further increase activity.

3. The relationship between surface area and catalyst activity is linear, with activity being dependent on the molybdena concentration. However, the rate of increase of activity slows down with further increases in surface area.

4. The maximum activity is achieved when the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdena. The activity is relatively insensitive to changes in particle size within the range of 2 to 20 mesh.

5. Carbon skeleton rearrangement occurs on a chromia-alumina catalyst, indicating the versatility of catalyst types in dehydrogenation processes.

6. The activated aluminas used in the study were products of the Aluminum Ore Company, with specific chemical compositions listed for the F and H series.

7. Molybdena was sourced as Baker's Analyzed ammonium molybdate with a purity of 83% MOO3 and minor impurities below 0.01%.

8. The n-heptane used in the study had a boiling point of 98.42°C and a freezing point of -90.65°C.

9. The coke deposited on the catalyst was determined by measuring the sum of carbon and hydrogen through combustion analysis, showing an approximate composition of CH.

10. The standard catalyst for comparison was found to have a reduction correction of 1.0 gram, and it was run at various feed rates for durations that ensured a consistent coke deposition.

11. Increasing the reduction temperature, hydrogen flow rate, or duration of reduction leads to higher activity levels, suggesting that a more complete reduction enhances catalytic efficiency.

12. Reproducibility of the results was demonstrated within a margin of 37% for TO and 2% yield for five tests conducted with the standard catalyst.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s, primarily focusing on factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Research has shown that the surface area of the support material plays a crucial role in determining the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Specifically, a linear relationship exists between the addition of molybdenum and the catalytic activity, until a concentration dependent on the alumina area is reached. Beyond this point, further increase in molybdenum loading does not lead to significant enhancements in activity. Moreover, the surface area of the catalyst is found to be critical, with a monolayer coverage of molybdenum observed at maximum activity. The activity of the catalyst is also relatively insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range. The measurement of surface area is performed using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, employing the sorption of n-butane at 0°C. The activity of the catalyst is determined by measuring the toluene production rate relative to a standard catalyst, allowing for the calculation of the catalyst's efficiency. Coke deposition on the catalyst is quantified by the sum of carbon and hydrogen measured through combustion analysis of a representative sample after the reaction.

自1980年代以来，对以钒氧化物为基的催化剂作为丙烷脱氢的替代品进行了大量研究，主要集中在载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等关键因素。研究表明，支持材料的表面积在决定催化剂活性和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。具体而言，在钼的添加量与催化活性之间存在线性关系，直到达到依赖于高岭土面积的浓度为止。在此之后，进一步增加钼的负载不会带来显著的活性提升。此外，发现表面面积对于催化剂至关重要，在最大活性时观察到单层钼覆盖。催化剂的活性也对颗粒大小的变化相对不敏感，特别是在指定范围内。通过使用Brunauer-Emmett-Teller（BET）方法，利用0°C的丁烷吸附来测量表面面积。催化剂的活性通过测量相对于标准催化剂的苯乙烯生成速率来确定，从而计算出催化剂的效率。通过燃烧分析代表样品中的焦炭沉积量来量化催化剂上的焦炭沉积，该分析是在反应后进行的。

The research explored the use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) for paraffin dehydrogenation. This area of study has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Variables including these parameters influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. The surface area of the support material significantly affects the catalytic activity, as the surface area correlates with the maximum activity level. The research also noted that the activity was insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range, indicating that the primary factor influencing activity was the impregnated area rather than the physical structure of the catalyst particles.
