          [1] "The development of a simple method for measuring surface areas of porous materials (1) provided a basis for correlating information on the action of adsorbents in this application."
          [2] "Activated aluminas were impregnated with varying quantities of molybdenum and their catalytic activities determined for dehydrocyclization of n-heptane to toluene at atmospheric pressure."
          [3] "Activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was attained."
          [4] "Further increase of area produced much less rapid increase of activity."
          [5] "Compari-son of the calculated molybdenum area with the experimental value for maximum activity shows that the alumina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdenum at maximum activity."
          [6] "Activity was relatively insensitive to change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s, focusing on factors such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. Surface area significantly influences catalytic activity, correlating with the maximum activity level. The activity is insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range, highlighting the importance of the impregnated area over the physical structure of the catalyst particles.

          自1980年代以来，研究使用以钒氧化物为基的催化剂作为铂（Pt）和铬酸盐（CrOx）的替代品，用于烷烃脱氢。该领域研究的重点包括载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载等参数。表面积显著影响催化活性，与最大活性水平成正比。在指定范围内，活性对颗粒大小的变化不敏感，强调了浸渍面积而非催化剂颗粒的物理结构的重要性。

          The relationship between surface area and activity was examined for molybdenum impregnated onto activated alumina. It was found that activity increased nearly linearly with added molybdenum until a concentration dependent on the alumina area was reached. Further increase of area led to a much slower increase in activity. At maximum activity, the alumina surface was covered with a monolayer of molybdenum, and the activity was relatively insensitive to changes in particle size within the specified range.

          在激活氧化铝上浸渍钼的情况下，研究了表面积与活性之间的关系。发现活性几乎呈线性增加，直到达到依赖于氧化铝面积的钼浓度为止。进一步增加表面积导致活性增加速度显著减慢。在最大活性时，氧化铝表面覆盖了一层单分子层的钼，且在指定范围内，活性对颗粒大小的变化相对不敏感。
