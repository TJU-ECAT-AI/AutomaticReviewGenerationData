[1] "At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles."
[2] "At 798 K and in the absence of hydrogen, the major mode of deactivation for the Pt/Sn/K-L catalyst is coking."
[3] "The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produces a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst."

The research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Key factors driving this exploration include the search for more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and stable catalysts. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on understanding the role of different carrier types, support surface area, and metal loadings in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. These factors can significantly impact the catalyst's performance, selectivity, and durability. The presence of potassium on silica-supported vanadium catalysts enhances their selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation, while the addition of tin can lead to deactivation mechanisms involving coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and sintering of metal particles. At lower temperatures (798 K) without hydrogen, the primary mode of deactivation is attributed to coking. The research highlights the importance of optimizing the composition and structure of vanadium oxide catalysts for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

自1980年代以来，对以二氧化钒为基的催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品的研究已经取得了显著进展。推动这一探索的关键因素包括寻找更经济、环保且稳定的催化剂。自1980年代以来，研究重点放在理解不同载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载对钒物种性质及其在这些催化剂中的行为的影响上。这些因素可以显著影响催化剂的性能、选择性和耐用性。钾在二氧化硅支持的钒催化剂上的存在提高了它们对异丁烷脱氢的选择性，而锡的添加可能导致脱活机制，包括结焦、表面锡的富集以及金属颗粒的聚集。在较低温度（798 K）下无氢的情况下，主要的脱活方式归因于结焦。研究表明，优化钒氧化物催化剂的组成和结构对于提高帕拉芬脱氢过程的效率和选择性至关重要。
