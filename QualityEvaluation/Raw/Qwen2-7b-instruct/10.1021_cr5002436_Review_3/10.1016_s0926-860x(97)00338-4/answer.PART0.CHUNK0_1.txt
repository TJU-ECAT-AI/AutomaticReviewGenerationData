Silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation Josephine M. Hill, R.D. Cortright, J.A. Dumesic*

1. "At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibited significantly higher rates of isobutene production compared to the Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalyst."
2. "Addition of Sn and K to Pt decreased the extent of carbon deposition on the catalysts by reducing the size of the Pt surface ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species that lead to coke and other undesirable products (e.g. hydrogenolysis)."
3. "In the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L zeolite become blocked by carbonaceous deposits during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K."
4. "At 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, the Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts exhibit deactivation due to coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and/or sintering of the metal particles."
5. "The presence of Sn may also facilitate the transport of the carbon deposits from the active sites to the support."
6. "The addition of potassium to silica-supported Pt/Sn produces a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst."
7. "However, at 873 K and in the presence of hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K/silica exhibited significantly lower isobutene production rates compared to Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts."
8. "At 798 K and in the absence of hydrogen, the addition of Sn and K to supported Pt catalysts improves the resistance of these catalysts to coking."

1. The Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts produced more isobutene than the Pt/Sn/K/ silica catalyst at 873 K in hydrogen.
2. Sn and K reduced carbon deposition on catalysts by decreasing the size of Pt surface ensembles, inhibiting reactions leading to coke.
3. Carbon deposition blocked pores of Pt/K-L zeolite during isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K without hydrogen.
4. At 873 K in hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts deactivated due to coking, surface tin enrichment, and metal particle sintering.
5. Sn might transport carbon deposits from active sites to the support.
6. Potassium improved the selectivity of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.
7. Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts produced less isobutene than Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts at 873 K in hydrogen.
8. Adding Sn and K to Pt catalysts increased resistance to coking at 798 K without hydrogen.

1. 在873 K氢气存在下，Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂比Pt/Sn/K/硅催化剂产生更多异丁烯。
2. Sn和K通过减少Pt表面簇的大小，抑制导致焦炭和其他不良产品的反应，减少了催化剂上的碳沉积。
3. 氢气不存在的情况下，在798 K时，Pt/K-L沸石上碳沉积堵塞了沸石孔道。
4. 在873 K氢气存在下，Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂由于焦炭形成、表面锡富集和金属颗粒烧结而失效。
5. Sn可能将碳沉积物从活性位点运输到支撑。
6. 添加钾提高了硅支持的Pt/Sn催化剂的异丁烷脱氢选择性。
7. Pt/Sn/K/silica催化剂在873 K氢气条件下产生的异丁烯少于Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂。
8. 向Pt催化剂添加Sn和K增加了在798 K氢气不存在条件下的抗焦炭形成能力。
