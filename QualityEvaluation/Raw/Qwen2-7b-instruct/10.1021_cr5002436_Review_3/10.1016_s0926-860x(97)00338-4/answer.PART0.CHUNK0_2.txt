<p>The origin of this behavior appears to be related to the formation of coke on the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Studies on Pt/Sn/alumina [21,22] and Pt/Sn/NaY-zeolite [10] have shown that the proportion of tin in metallic particles increased with metal particle size.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Merlen et al. [22] have suggested that metallic tin cannot be stabilized in small particles.</p>
<p>Thus, the Sn2 in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst may slowly become reduced in the presence of hydrogen during isobutane dehydrogenation at 873 K and migrate to the Pt/Sn alloy particles, resulting in sur- face enrichment with metallic Sn and the loss of accessible Pt sites.</p>
<p>Although the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst has an important effect on catalytic activity, it is also important to address the location of the carbon (e.g. whether carbon is on the active sites or on the support) [23].</p>
<p>It has been shown that the lower tem- perature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support [14,16,2325].</p>
<p>Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n- butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited.</p>

1. The formation of coke on the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen seems to be the cause of the observed behavior.
2. Research on Pt/Sn/alumina and Pt/Sn/NaY-zeolite has revealed that the proportion of tin in metallic particles rises with increasing particle size.
3. Metallic tin might not be stabilized in small particles, according to Merlen et al.
4. The Sn2 in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst could gradually reduce in the presence of hydrogen during isobutane dehydrogenation at 873 K, moving to the Pt/Sn alloy particles and causing surface enrichment with metallic Sn and a loss of accessible Pt sites.
5. The location of carbon (whether it is on the active sites or the support) plays a crucial role in catalytic activity.
6. Lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra typically indicate carbon on the Pt surface, whereas higher temperature peaks suggest carbon on the support.
7. Liwu et al.'s study on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 found that Sn reduced the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal compared to total carbon deposited.

1. 在没有氢的情况下，催化剂上的焦炭形成似乎是这种行为的原因。
2. 对于Pt/Sn/alumina和Pt/Sn/NaY-沸石的研究显示，随着颗粒尺寸的增加，锡在金属中的比例会上升。
3. 根据Merlen等人的说法，金属锡可能不能稳定在小颗粒中。
4. 在873 K下进行异丁烷脱氢过程中，在氢气的存在下，Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂中的Sn2可能会逐渐还原，移动到Pt/Sn合金颗粒中，并在表面富集金属Sn，导致可访问的Pt位点损失。
5. 碳的位置（它是在活性位点还是在支撑上）对催化活性起着至关重要的作用。
6. TPO谱中的较低温度峰通常表示Pt表面的碳，而较高温度峰则表示支撑上的碳。
7. Liwu等人对Pt/Al2O3和Pt/Sn/Al2O3的研究发现，Sn减少了金属上沉积的碳与总碳沉积的比例。
