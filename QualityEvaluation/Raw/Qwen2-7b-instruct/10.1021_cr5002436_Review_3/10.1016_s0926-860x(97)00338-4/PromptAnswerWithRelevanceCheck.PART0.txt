<p>The origin of this behavior appears to be related to the formation of coke on the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Studies on Pt/Sn/alumina [21,22] and Pt/Sn/NaY-zeolite [10] have shown that the proportion of tin in metallic particles increased with metal particle size.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Merlen et al. [22] have suggested that metallic tin cannot be stabilized in small particles.</p>
<p>Thus, the Sn2 in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst may slowly become reduced in the presence of hydrogen during isobutane dehydrogenation at 873 K and migrate to the Pt/Sn alloy particles, resulting in sur- face enrichment with metallic Sn and the loss of accessible Pt sites.</p>
<p>Although the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst has an important effect on catalytic activity, it is also important to address the location of the carbon (e.g. whether carbon is on the active sites or on the support) [23].</p>
<p>It has been shown that the lower tem- perature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support [14,16,2325].</p>
<p>Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n- butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The formation of coke on the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen seems to be the cause of the observed behavior.
2. Research on Pt/Sn/alumina and Pt/Sn/NaY-zeolite has revealed that the proportion of tin in metallic particles rises with increasing particle size.
3. Metallic tin might not be stabilized in small particles, according to Merlen et al.
4. The Sn2 in the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst could gradually reduce in the presence of hydrogen during isobutane dehydrogenation at 873 K, moving to the Pt/Sn alloy particles and causing surface enrichment with metallic Sn and a loss of accessible Pt sites.
5. The location of carbon (whether it is on the active sites or the support) plays a crucial role in catalytic activity.
6. Lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra typically indicate carbon on the Pt surface, whereas higher temperature peaks suggest carbon on the support.
7. Liwu et al.'s study on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 found that Sn reduced the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal compared to total carbon deposited.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在没有氢的情况下，催化剂上的焦炭形成似乎是这种行为的原因。
2. 对于Pt/Sn/alumina和Pt/Sn/NaY-沸石的研究显示，随着颗粒尺寸的增加，锡在金属中的比例会上升。
3. 根据Merlen等人的说法，金属锡可能不能稳定在小颗粒中。
4. 在873 K下进行异丁烷脱氢过程中，在氢气的存在下，Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂中的Sn2可能会逐渐还原，移动到Pt/Sn合金颗粒中，并在表面富集金属Sn，导致可访问的Pt位点损失。
5. 碳的位置（它是在活性位点还是在支撑上）对催化活性起着至关重要的作用。
6. TPO谱中的较低温度峰通常表示Pt表面的碳，而较高温度峰则表示支撑上的碳。
7. Liwu等人对Pt/Al2O3和Pt/Sn/Al2O3的研究发现，Sn减少了金属上沉积的碳与总碳沉积的比例。

The literature discusses the deactivation mechanisms of Pt/Sn/K catalysts during isobutane dehydrogenation. At 873 K with hydrogen, deactivation occurs due to coking, tin enrichment, and metal particle sintering. Without hydrogen at 798 K, coking becomes the primary deactivation mechanism. The presence of tin and potassium reduces the size of the platinum surface ensembles, inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. Potassium enhances the selectivity of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts. However, Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts show significantly lower isobutene production rates than Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts at 873 K with hydrogen. Adding tin and potassium to supported Pt catalysts increases their resistance to coking at 798 K without hydrogen.

文献讨论了在异丁烷脱氢过程中Pt/Sn/K催化剂的失活机制。在873 K和氢气存在下，失活主要由于结焦、表面锡富集和金属颗粒聚集发生。在798 K且无氢气的情况下，结焦成为主要的失活机制。锡和钾的存在减少了铂表面团簇的大小，抑制了氢解、异构化和结焦反应。钾提高了二氧化硅支持的Pt/Sn催化剂的选择性。然而，在873 K和氢气存在下，Pt/Sn/K/silica催化剂的异丁烯生成速率显著低于Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂。在798 K且无氢气情况下，添加锡和钾到支持的Pt催化剂可以提高它们抵抗结焦的能力。

The research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved significantly since the 1980s. Key factors driving this exploration include the search for more cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and stable catalysts. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on understanding the role of different carrier types, support surface area, and metal loadings in influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species within these catalysts. These factors can significantly impact the catalyst's performance, selectivity, and durability. The presence of potassium on silica-supported vanadium catalysts enhances their selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation, while the addition of tin can lead to deactivation mechanisms involving coking, enrichment of the surface with tin, and sintering of metal particles. At lower temperatures (798 K) without hydrogen, the primary mode of deactivation is attributed to coking. The research highlights the importance of optimizing the composition and structure of vanadium oxide catalysts for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in paraffin dehydrogenation processes.

自1980年代以来，对以二氧化钒为基的催化剂作为石蜡脱氢的替代品的研究已经取得了显著进展。推动这一探索的关键因素包括寻找更经济、环保且稳定的催化剂。自1980年代以来，研究重点放在理解不同载体类型、支持表面面积和金属负载对钒物种性质及其在这些催化剂中的行为的影响上。这些因素可以显著影响催化剂的性能、选择性和耐用性。钾在二氧化硅支持的钒催化剂上的存在提高了它们对异丁烷脱氢的选择性，而锡的添加可能导致脱活机制，包括结焦、表面锡的富集以及金属颗粒的聚集。在较低温度（798 K）下无氢的情况下，主要的脱活方式归因于结焦。研究表明，优化钒氧化物催化剂的组成和结构对于提高帕拉芬脱氢过程的效率和选择性至关重要。
