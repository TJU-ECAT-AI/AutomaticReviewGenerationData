1. During isobutane dehydrogenation at 798 K in the absence of hydrogen, the pores of Pt/K-L-zeolite become blocked by carbon deposits.
2. The presence of tin and potassium enhances the resistance of supported platinum catalysts against coke formation.
3. At 873 K with hydrogen, Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts lose activity due to coke formation, tin surface enrichment, and metal particle sintering.
4. At 798 K without hydrogen, the primary cause of catalyst deactivation for Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts is coke buildup.
5. Adding potassium to silica-supported platinum and tin catalysts yields a highly selective isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst.

1. 在798 K的无氢条件下进行异丁烷脱氢时，Pt/K-L-沸石的孔隙被碳沉积物堵塞。
2. 锡和钾的存在提高了支持型铂催化剂抵抗结焦的能力。
3. 在873 K下有氢气存在的情况下，Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂由于结焦、表面锡富集和金属颗粒烧结而失去活性。
4. 在798 K下无氢气条件下，Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂的主要失活原因是结焦。
5. 将钾添加到二氧化硅支持的铂和锡催化剂中产生了一种高度选择性的异丁烷脱氢催化剂。
