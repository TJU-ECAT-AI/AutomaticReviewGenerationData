The literature discusses the deactivation mechanisms of Pt/Sn/K catalysts during isobutane dehydrogenation. At 873 K with hydrogen, deactivation occurs due to coking, tin enrichment, and metal particle sintering. Without hydrogen at 798 K, coking becomes the primary deactivation mechanism. The presence of tin and potassium reduces the size of the platinum surface ensembles, inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions. Potassium enhances the selectivity of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts. However, Pt/Sn/K/silica catalysts show significantly lower isobutene production rates than Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts at 873 K with hydrogen. Adding tin and potassium to supported Pt catalysts increases their resistance to coking at 798 K without hydrogen.

文献讨论了在异丁烷脱氢过程中Pt/Sn/K催化剂的失活机制。在873 K和氢气存在下，失活主要由于结焦、表面锡富集和金属颗粒聚集发生。在798 K且无氢气的情况下，结焦成为主要的失活机制。锡和钾的存在减少了铂表面团簇的大小，抑制了氢解、异构化和结焦反应。钾提高了二氧化硅支持的Pt/Sn催化剂的选择性。然而，在873 K和氢气存在下，Pt/Sn/K/silica催化剂的异丁烯生成速率显著低于Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂。在798 K且无氢气情况下，添加锡和钾到支持的Pt催化剂可以提高它们抵抗结焦的能力。
