<p>It is expected that new steam crackers will provide sufficient ethylene to meet the growing demand. Propylene production will increase as well; however, according to experts the production capacity will be insufficient to cover the demand.</p>
<p>With the recent high oil prices, research has been directed to the development of processes based on alternative feedstocks for the production of lower olefins.</p>
<p>Although coal has long been used as a feedstock for the chemical industry, for instance, for the production of acetylene via the carbide process and for the synthesis of ammonia, in times of abundant low-cost oil and gas, its role diminished.</p>
<p>The rapid increase of energy demand, the high oil and gas prices, and the strategic drive of coal-rich countries to reduce their dependence on imported crude oil have led to reconsider coal as a primary feedstock for the production of chemicals.</p>
<p>Biomass gasification has potential as a source for hydrocarbon products in view of feedstock flexibility and the possibilities to reduce net CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>With the recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S., (16, 17) new possibilities are open for the transformation of natural gas to olefins.</p>
<p>The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets.</p>
<p>Largely because of the recent high oil prices, the production of lower olefins via naphtha cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry.</p>
<p>There is a growing awareness of the depletion of conventional oil reserves.</p>
<p>Feedstocks such as biomass have lower net CO2 contribution.</p>
<p>Many countries, among them Japan, China, and Brazil, are searching for alternatives to reduce their reliance on imported crude oil and refined products.</p>
<p>Several processes have been developed in an attempt to solve one or more of the challenges encountered by the lower olefins industry.</p>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by factors such as the high cost of precious metals, the search for more environmentally friendly processes, and the desire to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with advancements in catalyst design, synthesis, and understanding of the underlying chemistry.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several factors:

1. **Carrier Type**: The choice of carrier material plays a crucial role in determining the dispersion and stability of vanadium species. Carriers like aluminum oxide, silica, or metal oxides can alter the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. For instance, alumina is often used due to its high surface area and inertness, which can promote better dispersion of vanadium.

2. **Support Surface Area**: The surface area of the support can affect the reactivity and stability of vanadium species. Higher surface area supports can lead to better dispersion of vanadium, potentially enhancing the catalyst's performance. However, the trade-off is often a balance between surface area and the ability to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. **Metal Loading**: The amount of vanadium loaded onto the support influences the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability. Optimal metal loading is crucial for achieving the desired balance between these factors. Too little vanadium may not provide sufficient catalytic activity, while too much can lead to agglomeration, reducing the surface area available for reaction.

These factors collectively impact the effectiveness of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenating paraffins. Researchers aim to optimize these parameters to create catalysts with improved performance characteristics, such as higher activity, better selectivity, and longer lifespans, while also considering economic viability and environmental impact.

探索以五氧化二钒为基础的催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品用于烷烃脱氢，主要受到贵金属成本高、寻求更环保过程以及提高效率和降低能耗等因素的驱动。自1980年代以来，该领域研究已取得显著进展，包括催化剂设计、合成和对基础化学的理解。

五氧化二钒在这些催化剂中的性质受以下几个因素影响：

1. **载体类型**：选择载体材料对于确定五氧化二钒物种的分散性和稳定性至关重要。铝酸盐、硅酸盐或金属氧化物等载体可以改变催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。例如，由于其高表面积和惰性，氧化铝经常被使用，这有助于更好地分散五氧化二钒。

2. **支持表面面积**：支持的表面积会影响五氧化二钒物种的反应性和稳定性。较高的表面积支持可以促进五氧化二钒的更好分散，从而可能增强催化剂的性能。然而，这与能够承受苛刻反应条件的能力之间的平衡是关键。

3. **金属负载量**：负载到支持上的五氧化二钒的数量影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。合适的金属负载量对于实现所需平衡至关重要。过少的五氧化二钒可能导致活性不足，而过多则可能导致聚集，减少可用于反应的表面积。

这些因素共同影响五氧化二钒基催化剂在脱氢烷烃的有效性。研究人员旨在优化这些参数以创建具有改进性能特性的催化剂，如更高的活性、更好的选择性和更长的使用寿命，同时考虑经济可行性和环境影响。

The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values.
