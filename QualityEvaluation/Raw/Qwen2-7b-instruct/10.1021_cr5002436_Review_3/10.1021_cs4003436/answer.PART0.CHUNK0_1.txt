The vast majority of the catalysts suggested for FTO contain iron. In comparison to cobalt, iron is less expensive, it has a lower activity, Fe FischerTropsch products have a higher olefin content, as iron is less reactive to secondary hydrogenation reactions, and it displays lower methane selectivity at the high temperatures necessary to drive alpha to lower values.
