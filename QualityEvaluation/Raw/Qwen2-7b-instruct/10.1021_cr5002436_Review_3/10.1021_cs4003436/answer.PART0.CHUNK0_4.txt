[1] "The FTO process displays lower ethylene and propylene selectivities in comparison to MTO or DMTO."
[2] "The main challenge is to maintain the high C2C4 selectivity at high CO conversion levels."
[3] "Iron can be presented as the metal of choice for the FTO reaction as it is inexpensive, it is highly selective toward olefins, and it is possible to achieve methane selectivities below the prediction of the ASF product distribution."
[4] "The design of effective iron-based catalysts for the selective production of light olefins involves several factors:• The selection of a support that enables the formation of the active phase and its intimate contact with the chemical promoters • The adequate choice of promoters to increase the selectivity to light olefins and minimize methane production • The use of preparation methods that allow obtaining a homogeneous spatial distribution of iron-containing particles with narrow size distribution in the optimum size range • The selection of optimum process conditions to maximize the catalyst life without compromising product selectivity"

1. The FTO process results in lower yields of ethylene and propylene compared to MTO or DMTO.
2. Maintaining high selectivity for C2C4 olefins at high CO conversion levels poses a significant challenge.
3. Iron is a preferred choice for FTO reactions due to its affordability, high olefin selectivity, and ability to achieve methane selectivities below the ASF model predictions.
4. Designing effective iron-based catalysts for light olefin production requires considering the selection of a support that facilitates active phase formation, the use of appropriate promoters to enhance olefin selectivity and reduce methane production, employing preparation methods for homogeneous particle distribution, and optimizing process conditions to prolong catalyst life without sacrificing product selectivity.

1.FTO过程的乙烯和丙烯选择性相比MTO或DMTO要低。
2.在高CO转化率下保持高C2C4烃选择性存在挑战。
3.铁是FTO反应的理想选择，因为它价格低廉、对烯烃的选择性高，并且能够实现低于ASF模型预测的甲烷选择性。
4.设计高效的铁基催化剂用于轻质烯烃生产需要考虑选择促进活性相形成的支持物、使用合适的促进剂以提高烯烃选择性和减少甲烷生成、采用制备方法实现均匀粒子分布、以及优化工艺条件以延长催化剂寿命而不牺牲产品选择性。
