[1] "The constant growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years."
[2] "Apart from high oil prices, there are some other drivers in the search for alternative routes and feedstocks..."
[3] "With the recent discovery of large shale gas reserves in the U.S., (16, 17) new possibilities are open for the transformation of natural gas to olefins."
[4] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets."
[5] "These issues have also opened opportunities for alternative processes for the production of propylene and butylenes."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation started evolving in the 1980s. Research efforts have focused on understanding how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Variables such as carrier type can alter the electronic properties of vanadium, impacting its ability to catalyze dehydrogenation reactions. Surface area affects the accessibility of reactants to the active sites on the catalyst, while metal loading determines the concentration of vanadium species, which can significantly impact the catalytic activity and selectivity. The study of these factors helps in optimizing the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, aiming for higher efficiency and selectivity in the production of olefins.
