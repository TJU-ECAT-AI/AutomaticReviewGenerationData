[1] "It is interesting to observe for instance how the number of patents on the direct production of light olefins from syngas reached maximum values after the oil embargo of 1973 and the second oil crisis in 1979. The shortage and the consequent high cost of oil for the production of light olefins via naphtha cracking increased the urge to develop alternative routes to produce these valuable commodity chemicals via syngas-based processes."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation gained momentum in the 1980s due to the oil crises of 1973 and 1979. The scarcity and elevated cost of oil, particularly when produced through naphtha cracking, spurred research efforts to devise alternative methodologies for synthesizing light olefins from syngas.

由于1973年和1979年的石油危机，对石油的需求量增加导致了石油成本上涨。在通过石脑油裂解生产轻烯烃时，这种稀缺性和成本上涨促使人们开始探索使用水煤气合成法作为替代途径来生产这些宝贵的化工原料。因此，在1980年代，研究人员开始研究以氧化钒为基底的催化剂，将其作为铂和铬氧化物的替代品用于烷烃脱氢反应。
