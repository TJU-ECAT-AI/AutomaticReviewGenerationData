[1] "Since the development of platforming processes in the late 1940s and the later discoveries that Pt catalyzes alkane skeletal rearrangement reactions, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively studied for many applications."
[2] "Silica supported platinum-gold and platinum-copper catalysts prepared from organometallic cluster precursors were characterized with diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO."
[3] "Because of the effects that dipole coupling of adsorbed carbon monoxide molecules can have on the infrared spectrum, coverage studies were employed to evaluate the interactions between CO and the catalyst surfaces."
[4] "The lowering of the CO stretching frequency may be the result of the formation of unique alloys and particle morphologies."
[5] "In the case of the catalyst prepared from the platinum-copper cluster, two peaks were identified in the PtCO stretching region, one of which is postulated to be a bridging or semi-bridging mode between Pt and Cu."
[6] "Dipoledipole coupling is well-known to cause significant shifts in the observed stretching frequency for carbon monoxide bound to metal surfaces."
[7] "As the sample temperature was raised, surface coverage decreased, and the observed CO stretching frequency for platinum bound CO shifted to lower frequencies."
[8] "The high temperature CO stretches for the 1-Pt2Au4 and 1-Pt2Cu4 catalysts suggest the possibility of electronic differences between the cluster derived catalysts and the monometallic 1-Pt catalyst."
[9] "Comparing these two parameters using ambient temperature CO stretching frequencies (in which dipoledipole coupling is still a large factor) suggests a loose correlation may exist."
[10] "However, using the IR data taken at elevated temperatures as a more accurate measure of ν(CO) (hence a more accurate measure of the metalcarbon bond strength), it is clear that there is little or no correlation between ν(CO) and cracking activity."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol-gel processes. These methods have various advantages, including ease of operation, controllable metal loading, and the ability to incorporate multiple metals. However, they may face challenges such as uneven metal distribution, sintering, and metal segregation. The use of organometallic cluster precursors, as seen in this study, offers a potentially more effective method for preparing highly dispersed bimetallic particles with unique morphologies and electronic properties, which can enhance selectivities and discovery of new catalyst properties.

2. The document does not explicitly compare the potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, based on the context provided, using organometallic cluster precursors appears to offer an advantage in preparing catalysts with specific morphologies and electronic properties, which could lead to improved performance compared to catalysts synthesized using traditional methods. This method enables the preparation of catalysts with high dispersion and unique structures, potentially leading to enhanced selectivity and reactivity.
