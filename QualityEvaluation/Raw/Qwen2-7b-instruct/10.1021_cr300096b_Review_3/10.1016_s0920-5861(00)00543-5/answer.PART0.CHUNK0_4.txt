The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnation techniques and the use of organometallic cluster precursors. Impregnation methods include incipient wetness impregnation, where the metal precursor is added to the support material while it is in a liquid state. Organometallic cluster precursors, on the other hand, offer a way to prepare supported catalysts with specific morphologies and electronic properties. These methods compare favorably in terms of catalyst production due to their ability to control particle sizes and dispersions, leading to enhanced catalytic activities and selectivities. However, they may face challenges in achieving highly dispersed particles and uniform compositions, especially when dealing with bimetallic systems.
