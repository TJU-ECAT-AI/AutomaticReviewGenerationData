[1] "Supported alloys comprised of an active group VIII metal and an inactive group IB metal have been examined as catalysts for a wide variety of industrially important reactions."
[2] "Since the development of platforming processes in the late 1940s and the later discoveries that Pt catalyzes alkane skeletal rearrangement reactions, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively studied for many applications."
[3] "A few examples of heterogeneous catalyst applications include the production of vinyl acetate (Pd-Au) [6] ,[7] , emissions control catalysts (Pt-Au) [8] , and the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons (Pt-Cu) [9] ."
[4] "Silica supported platinum-gold and platinum-copper catalysts prepared from organometallic cluster precursors were characterized with diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed CO."
[5] "Because of the effects that dipole coupling of adsorbed carbon monoxide molecules can have on the infrared spectrum, coverage studies were employed to evaluate the interactions between CO and the catalyst surfaces."
[6] "The lowering of the CO stretching frequency may be the result of the formation of unique alloys and particle morphologies."
[7] "DRIFT spectra of the 1-Pt2Au4 ( Fig. 2 ) and 1-Pt2Cu4 ( Fig. 4 ) catalysts at ambient temperature have important distinctions from the impregnated platinum catalyst prepared for this study."
[8] "For all the catalysts investigated, as the sample temperature was raised, surface coverage decreased, and the observed CO stretching frequency for platinum bound CO shifted to lower frequencies."
[9] "The CO coverage experiments cannot attribute the differences in DRIFT spectra to electronic effects, however."
[10] "The observed shifts are on the high end of what might be expected for geometric effects; however, considering the diversity in morphologies and particle sizes of the catalysts involved as well as the possible effects of CO clustering and residual chlorine, the observed shifts are reasonable without invoking traditional electronic effects."

1. Commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation, sol-gel, and molecular cluster precursors. Impregnation methods are straightforward but may not offer precise control over metal particle sizes and distributions. Sol-gel methods can provide more uniform particle sizes but are labor-intensive. Molecular cluster precursors allow for the preparation of highly dispersed particles, offering a promising avenue for enhancing selectivities and discovering new catalyst properties.
2. The synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts using molecular cluster precursors is advantageous because it enables the preparation of highly dispersed particles with unique morphologies and electronic properties. This method facilitates the stabilization of specific morphologies and electronic states, which can be crucial for achieving high selectivities in chemical reactions. The literature indicates that catalysts prepared from bimetallic molecular cluster precursors exhibit different infrared spectroscopy patterns compared to those prepared through conventional impregnation methods. These differences highlight the potential benefits of using molecular cluster precursors in the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in terms of particle dispersion and the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces.

1. 制备双金属催化剂的常用方法包括浸渍法、溶胶-凝胶法和分子簇前体法。浸渍法操作简单，但可能无法精确控制金属颗粒的大小分布。溶胶-凝胶法可以提供更均匀的颗粒大小，但过程较为繁琐。分子簇前体法允许制备高度分散的颗粒，并具有独特的形态和电子性质。这种方法有助于稳定特定的形态和电子状态，这对于实现化学反应的高选择性至关重要。文献表明，从双金属分子簇前体制备的催化剂与通过传统浸渍法制备的催化剂在红外光谱图案上存在差异。这些差异突显了使用分子簇前体在双金属催化剂合成中可能带来的优势，尤其是在颗粒分散性和催化剂表面电子性质方面。
