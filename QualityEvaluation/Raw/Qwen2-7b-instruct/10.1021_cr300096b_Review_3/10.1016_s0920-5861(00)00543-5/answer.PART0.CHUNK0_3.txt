[1] "Recently, we reported on the preparation and characterization of supported bimetallic Pt-Au and Pt-Cu catalysts from the bimetallic molecular cluster precursors Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 and Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8 [29] ,[30] ."
[2] "Because of the effects that dipole coupling of adsorbed carbon monoxide molecules can have on the infrared spectrum, coverage studies were employed to evaluate the interactions between CO and the catalyst surfaces."
[3] "The lowering of the CO stretching frequency may be the result of the formation of unique alloys and particle morphologies."
[4] "In the case of the catalyst prepared from the platinum-copper cluster, two peaks were identified in the PtCO stretching region, one of which is postulated to be a bridging or semi-bridging mode between Pt and Cu."
[5] "In order to evaluate the singleton CO stretching frequency, isotopic dilution studies with O or coverage studies must be employed to eliminate dipole coupling effects."
[6] "The addition of a second metal greatly complicates the preparation and characterization of highly dispersed particles. Factors such as metal segregation and sintering, surface enrichment of the inactive metal, and compositional inhomogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation methods."
[7] "For the cluster derived Pt-Cu catalysts in particular, these ensembles may contain very few platinum atoms and possibly isolated platinum atoms embedded in the copper."
[8] "The details of the general procedure have been previously reported for the support of phosphine stabilized Pt and Pt-Au compounds [34] ,[35] and were similarly employed in this study."
[9] "The DRIFTS spectra of the 1-Pt2Au4 ( Fig. 2 ) and 1-Pt2Cu4 ( Fig. 4 ) catalysts at ambient temperature have important distinctions from the impregnated platinum catalyst prepared for this study."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the use of bimetallic molecular precursors, specifically Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 and Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8, as reported in the literature. These methods are advantageous because they lead to the preparation of highly dispersed particles, which is crucial for maximizing the active metal surface area. However, the preparation and characterization of these bimetallic particles are complicated by factors such as metal segregation and sintering, surface enrichment of the inactive metal, and compositional inhomogeneity, which makes it difficult to achieve highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles using conventional impregnation methods. The use of molecular precursors allows for the preparation of unique particle morphologies, which might contribute to the observed differences in electronic properties compared to catalysts prepared from platinic acid. The DRIFTS spectra of the Pt-Cu catalyst suggest the presence of mixed ensembles involving both platinum and copper, offering possible spectroscopic evidence for such a mixed ensemble binding motif.

本文中提到的最常用的双金属催化剂合成方法是使用双金属分子前体，如Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8和Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8。这些方法的优势在于能够制备出高度分散的颗粒，这对于最大化活性金属表面积至关重要。然而，由于金属分选、烧结、惰性金属表面富集以及双金属颗粒组成不均一等因素的存在，使用常规浸渍法制备高度分散且均匀的双金属颗粒变得困难。使用分子前体可以制备出独特的颗粒形态，这可能解释了与从铂酸盐制备的催化剂相比，观察到的电子性质差异。PT-Cu催化剂的DRIFTS光谱显示存在铂和铜的混合簇，这提供了可能的光谱证据表明存在铂和铜的混合簇绑定模式。
