2.1 "All synthesis was carried out using standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere using a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy as follows."
2.2 "In situ NEXAFS results show that Co remains fully reduced during the reaction when in the presence of Pt, however XPS and TEM recorded during exposure to a reducing hydrogen atmosphere suggest that Pt will segregate to the surface during the reaction preventing the access of reactants to the cobalt component of the catalysts."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere using a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy. These methods offer the potential advantages of precise control over the size and composition of the nanoparticles, facilitating the preparation of model catalysts for studying reactions under realistic conditions. In terms of applications, these methods are widely used for the development of catalysts in various industrial processes, such as the conversion of gases to liquid fuels. The efficacy of these methods lies in their ability to produce well-defined catalyst structures that can be tailored to optimize catalytic performance.

The comparison between these methods and others, such as incipient wetness impregnation, highlights the benefits of colloidal synthesis in terms of control over the particle size and morphology, leading to potentially superior catalytic activity and stability. However, the choice of synthesis method depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst, such as the desired particle size, the need for specific particle shapes, and the compatibility with downstream characterization techniques.

支持双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括在Ar气氛下的标准Schlenk技术使用胶体化学合成策略。这些方法提供了精确控制纳米粒子大小和组成的潜力，有助于制备模型催化剂以研究在真实条件下进行的反应。在应用方面，这些方法广泛用于各种工业过程中的气体到液体燃料转换催化剂的发展。这些方法的有效性在于它们能够产生可定制结构的催化剂，以优化催化性能。

与浸渍湿法等其他方法相比，胶体制备方法的优势在于对颗粒尺寸和形态的控制，这可能导致更优的催化活性和稳定性。然而，选择合成方法取决于催化剂的具体要求，如所需颗粒大小、特定颗粒形状的需求以及与后续表征技术的兼容性。
