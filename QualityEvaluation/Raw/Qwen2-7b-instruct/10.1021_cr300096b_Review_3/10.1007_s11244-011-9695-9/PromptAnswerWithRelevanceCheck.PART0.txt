[1] "All synthesis was carried out using standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere using a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy as follows."
[2] "The metal precursor salts were dissolved in a reducing solvent (oleylamine) at 80 C."
[3] "As-synthesized nanoparticles were then stored in chloroform until further use."
[4] "These were prepared using a method based on that of Alivisatos [14] and modified as follows."
[5] "The resulting colloidal suspension was aged at 205 C for 20 min before terminating the reaction by removing heat and cooling to room temperature."
[6] "This suspension was treated at 100 C in vacuum for 12 h prior to analysis."
[7] "Samples were prepared by drop casting the nanoparticles (in chloroform) onto an ultra thin carbon coated copper TEM grid."
[8] "Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading)."

Answer: The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include colloidal chemical synthesis strategies, which involve dissolving metal precursor salts in reducing solvents at specific temperatures, followed by aging the resulting colloidal suspensions. These methods require storing the as-synthesized nanoparticles in solvents like chloroform before further use. Additionally, modified methods based on those developed by Alivisatos are employed, which include injecting metal precursors into solutions under controlled conditions. After synthesis, the nanoparticles are typically treated at high temperatures in vacuum conditions before being analyzed. For supporting the nanoparticles on a solid substrate, mesoporous silica, such as MCF-17, is used, adjusting the Co concentration in Pt-containing samples to maintain a stable metal loading. These methods enable the precise control of catalyst size, composition, and structure, facilitating detailed investigations under reaction conditions.

这些合成方法主要包括胶体化学合成策略，涉及在特定温度下将金属前体盐溶解于还原溶剂中。然后，通过老化得到的胶体悬浮液。这些方法要求在进一步使用之前将合成的纳米颗粒存放在溶剂如氯仿中。此外，基于Alivisatos开发的方法也被采用，包括快速将金属前体注入溶液中。合成后，纳米颗粒通常在真空条件下经过高温处理，然后再进行分析。为了支持纳米颗粒在固体基质上，使用了多孔硅酸盐，如MCF-17，并根据铂含量样品调整钴的浓度，以维持稳定的金属负载。这些方法能够精确控制催化剂的大小、组成和结构，从而便于在反应条件下进行详细研究。

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere using a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy. These methods are advantageous for their ability to produce catalysts with controlled size and composition. They are widely applied in the production of supported bimetallic catalysts for various applications, including CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

2. The synthesis methods used for supported bimetallic catalysts can vary significantly in their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. For instance, the colloidal chemical synthesis strategy allows for the preparation of catalysts with precise control over size and composition. This is particularly useful in studies of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, where detailed characterization under reaction conditions is crucial. The ability to tailor the catalyst's properties enables researchers to optimize the catalyst for specific reactions, enhancing its performance and efficiency.

3. The ambient pressure XPS results indicate that Pt appears to dominate the surface in the presence of H2. This suggests that under the conditions of the catalytic reaction, which is predominantly reducing, access of the reactants to the cobalt component of the catalysts is very limited. This finding highlights the importance of understanding the surface chemistry of bimetallic catalysts for improving their performance in CO2 hydrogenation and similar reactions.

4. The segregation of Pt to the surface in a reducing atmosphere, as observed through environmental TEM, supports the notion that the promotional effects of Pt on incipient wetness cobalt catalysts might stem from non-uniform nanostructures. This insight could lead to the identification of the actual structure of platinum and cobalt that contributes most effectively in such reactions, potentially leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

2. 制备支持双金属催化剂的方法在优势、应用范围和整体生产效能方面存在显著差异。例如，胶体化学合成策略使得能够根据需要精确控制催化剂的大小和组成。这对于研究CO2氢化反应尤为重要，因为在这种情况下，对催化剂进行反应条件下的详细表征至关重要。这种定制化的能力使研究人员能够优化催化剂以适应特定反应，从而提高其性能和效率。

3. 通过环境XPS结果可以看出，在氢气的存在下，铂似乎占据了表面。这表明，在主要还原的催化反应条件下，反应物对催化剂中钴成分的访问非常有限。这一发现强调了理解双金属催化剂表面化学的重要性，以提高它们在CO2氢化和其他类似反应中的性能。

4. 环境透射电子显微镜观察到铂在还原气氛下向表面的分离，支持了这样的观点：铂在浸渍湿法钴催化剂中所起的促进作用可能源于非均匀纳米结构。这一洞见可能导致对在反应中起有效贡献的铂和钴的实际结构的识别，从而有可能推动更高效和选择性催化剂的发展。
