[1] "All synthesis was carried out using standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere using a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy as follows."
[2] "The metal precursor salts were dissolved in a reducing solvent (oleylamine) at 80 C."
[3] "As-synthesized nanoparticles were then stored in chloroform until further use."
[4] "These were prepared using a method based on that of Alivisatos [14] and modified as follows."
[5] "The resulting colloidal suspension was aged at 205 C for 20 min before terminating the reaction by removing heat and cooling to room temperature."
[6] "This suspension was treated at 100 C in vacuum for 12 h prior to analysis."
[7] "Samples were prepared by drop casting the nanoparticles (in chloroform) onto an ultra thin carbon coated copper TEM grid."
[8] "Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading)."

Answer: The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include colloidal chemical synthesis strategies, which involve dissolving metal precursor salts in reducing solvents at specific temperatures, followed by aging the resulting colloidal suspensions. These methods require storing the as-synthesized nanoparticles in solvents like chloroform before further use. Additionally, modified methods based on those developed by Alivisatos are employed, which include injecting metal precursors into solutions under controlled conditions. After synthesis, the nanoparticles are typically treated at high temperatures in vacuum conditions before being analyzed. For supporting the nanoparticles on a solid substrate, mesoporous silica, such as MCF-17, is used, adjusting the Co concentration in Pt-containing samples to maintain a stable metal loading. These methods enable the precise control of catalyst size, composition, and structure, facilitating detailed investigations under reaction conditions.

这些合成方法主要包括胶体化学合成策略，涉及在特定温度下将金属前体盐溶解于还原溶剂中。然后，通过老化得到的胶体悬浮液。这些方法要求在进一步使用之前将合成的纳米颗粒存放在溶剂如氯仿中。此外，基于Alivisatos开发的方法也被采用，包括快速将金属前体注入溶液中。合成后，纳米颗粒通常在真空条件下经过高温处理，然后再进行分析。为了支持纳米颗粒在固体基质上，使用了多孔硅酸盐，如MCF-17，并根据铂含量样品调整钴的浓度，以维持稳定的金属负载。这些方法能够精确控制催化剂的大小、组成和结构，从而便于在反应条件下进行详细研究。
