2.1 Catalyst Synthesis

The metal precursor salts were dissolved in a reducing solvent (oleylamine) at 80°C. Typically, H2PtCl6 (5.1 mg), Pt(acac)2 (36.0 mg) and Co(acac)2 (25.7 mg) were dissolved in oleylamine (5 mL).

2.1.1 11 nm Pt50Co50 Nanoparticles

This colloidal suspension was then aged at 230°C for 10 min prior to terminating the reaction by removing from the oil bath. The colloidal suspension was allowed to cool down to room temperature before precipitating the nanoparticles with acetone, centrifugation and re-dispersal in chloroform.

2.1.2 10 nm Co Nanoparticles

After evacuation of oleic acid (150 μL) in a 250 mL round bottom flask for 10 min, anhydrous dichlorobenzene (DCB, 15 mL) was added using an airtight syringe. The solution was heated to 173.1°C (as monitored by a submerged K-type thermocouple).

2.1.3 10.5  2.5 nm Co Nanoparticles

Anhydrous benzyl alcohol (15 mL) was added using an airtight syringe to a 250 mL 3-neck round bottom flask containing 111.0 mg PVP55k (evacuated and Ar purged to remove oxygen and moisture).

2.1.4 4 nm Pt50Co50 Nanoparticles

PVP-coated Pt50Co50 NPs were synthesized according to a protocol that has recently been reported by our group [15].

2.1.5 Catalyst Preparation

Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading).

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve dissolving metal precursors in reducing solvents like oleylamine or oleic acid, followed by aging, precipitation, and dispersion steps. The catalyst preparation includes loading the nanoparticles onto a support like mesoporous silica, adjusting the metal loadings for Pt and Co, and conditioning the catalyst under hydrogen at elevated temperatures.

合成支持双金属催化剂的方法包括将金属前体溶解在还原溶剂（如油酸）中，然后进行老化、沉淀和分散步骤。催化剂制备包括将纳米粒子负载到多孔硅等支持材料上，调整铂和钴的负载量，以及在氢气下对催化剂进行预热处理。
