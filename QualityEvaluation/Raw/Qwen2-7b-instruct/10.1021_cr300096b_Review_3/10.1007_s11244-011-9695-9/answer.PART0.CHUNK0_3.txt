[1] "All synthesis was carried out using standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere using a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy as follows."
[2] "Significantly, it was found that, even during reduction in hydrogen, Co nanoparticles still remained in high/non-metallic oxidation states, while their CoPt anologues did indeed contain cobalt in a reduced, fully metallic state."
[3] "The ambient pressure XPS results are presented in Fig. 6a which shows Pt 4f XP spectra of a 4 nm Pt50Co50 sample for three different incident photon energies."
[4] "Environmental TEM (although using larger 11 nm Pt50Co50 nanoparticles) is also indicative of exactly the same phenomenon."
[5] "The most noticeable result is that the PtCo catalysts are much less selective for CH4, producing almost exclusively CO instead."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere, employing a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy. These methods offer advantages in controlling the size and composition of nanoparticles, making them suitable for detailed studies under reaction conditions.

2. The synthesis methods used for bimetallic catalysts are compared in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. The colloidal chemical synthesis strategy allows for precise control over the size and composition of the nanoparticles, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

3. The ambient pressure XPS results reveal that the Pt 4f XP spectra of a 4 nm Pt50Co50 sample for three different incident photon energies, corresponding to probing depths of 0.48, 0.58, and 0.90 nm. This provides insights into the distribution of cobalt and platinum atoms within the nanoparticle.

4. Environmental TEM images demonstrate the surface segregation of platinum in a reducing atmosphere, indicating that under the conditions of the catalytic reaction, which is predominantly reducing, access of the reactants to the cobalt component is very limited.

5. The preliminary catalytic data suggests that the PtCo catalysts exhibit mostly Pt-like chemistry, leading to a preference for CO production over methane, which is a significant finding for understanding the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation.
