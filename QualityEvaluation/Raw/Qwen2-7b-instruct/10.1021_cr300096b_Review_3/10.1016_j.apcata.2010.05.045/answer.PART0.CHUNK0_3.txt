[1] "The experiments were carried out using nanoparticles containing an average of 40 platinum atoms encapsulated in a fourth-generation hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer [G4-OH(Pt40)]."
[2] "The supported catalysts were prepared by dispersing either 0.25 or 0.50 wt% Pt-DENs on a homemade solgel silica via wetness impregnation."
[3] "The size and shape of those nanoparticles were checked by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1 , most nanoparticles show a nearly spherical shape, and approximately the same size."
[4] "The results reported here are in general qualitative agreement with those reported before."
[5] "The catalysts proved to be particularly selective for the promotion of trans-to-cis isomerization: cis-2-butene amounted to more than half of all the products obtained under the conditions used in our catalytic kinetic experiments."

The synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts typically involves the use of colloidal chemistry and self-assembly approaches. These methods enable the precise control of the size and shape of metal nanoparticles, which is advantageous for achieving high selectivity in catalytic reactions. The literature describes the use of fourth-generation hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as templates for synthesizing Pt nanoparticles encapsulated within them (Pt-DENs). These Pt-DENs are then dispersed onto a homemade solgel silica support through wetness impregnation. The TEM analysis confirms the uniformity of the nanoparticles' size and shape. The study also highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate activation method, as treatments in vacuum or oxygen can lead to unwanted side effects. The most effective activation method identified was hydrogen pretreatment, which maintains the nanoparticles' size and shape while enhancing the catalyst's activity. The Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts demonstrate high selectivity for the conversion of trans-2-butene to cis-2-butene, making them particularly suitable for olefin isomerization reactions.

支持双金属催化剂的合成通常采用胶体化学和自组装方法。这些方法能够精确控制金属纳米颗粒的大小和形状，这对于在催化反应中实现高选择性非常有利。文献描述了使用第四代羟基终止聚（亚胺）胺（PAMAM）树状大分子作为模板来合成包覆在其中的铂纳米粒子（Pt-DEN）。然后将这些Pt-DEN分散到自制溶胶硅酸盐载体上，通过湿浸润法。透射电子显微镜分析证实了纳米粒子大小和形状的一致性。研究还强调了选择合适激活方法的重要性，真空或氧气处理可能会带来不利影响。最有效的激活方法是氢前处理，它既能保持纳米粒子的大小和形状，又能增强催化剂的活性。Pt-DEN/SiO2催化剂对反式2-丁烯转化为顺式2-丁烯显示出极高的选择性，特别适合于烯烃异构化反应。
