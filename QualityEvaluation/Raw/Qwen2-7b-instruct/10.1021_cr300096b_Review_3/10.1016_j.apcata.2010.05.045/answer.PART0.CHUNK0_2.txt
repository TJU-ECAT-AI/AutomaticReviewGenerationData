The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are colloidal chemistry and dendrimer templating. Colloidal chemistry allows for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with various well-defined shapes, which can then be dispersed onto a high-surface-area support. Dendrimer templating involves using a dendrimer as a template to encapsulate metal nanoparticles, which are then dispersed onto a support. These methods offer potential advantages such as precise control over the size and shape of the nanoparticles, leading to catalysts with enhanced performance and selectivity in hydrocarbon conversion reactions. In the context of the literature, colloidal chemistry was employed to synthesize Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in a PAMAM dendrimer, which were subsequently dispersed onto a silica support to create a supported catalyst. This method was found to yield catalysts with well-defined Pt nanoparticles (average 1.5 nm in diameter) that showed high activity and selectivity for olefin conversion reactions, particularly in promoting cis-to-trans isomerization.

用于制备支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法是胶体化学和树状大分子模板化。胶体化学允许通过合成具有不同精确形状的金属纳米颗粒，然后将其分散在高表面积载体上。树状大分子模板化涉及使用树状大分子作为模板来包覆金属纳米颗粒，然后将它们分散到载体上。这些方法提供了潜在的优势，如对纳米颗粒的大小和形状的精确控制，从而导致具有增强性能和选择性的催化剂，在烃类转化反应中。在此文献的背景下，胶体化学被用来合成封装在聚氨酰胺树状大分子中的铂纳米颗粒，然后将它们分散在硅酸盐支持材料上以创建支持型催化剂。这种方法被发现能够产生直径约为1.5nm的铂纳米颗粒的催化剂，显示出对烯烃转换反应的高度活性和选择性，特别是促进cis向trans异构化。
