[1] "Colloidal chemistry in particular has proven quite adept to the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with different well-defined shapes [12] ,[13] ,[14]."
[2] "Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to control the growth of colloidal particles to sizes below 5 nm."
[3] "An alternative way to grow small nanoparticles, with diameter of the order of 12 nm and narrow size distributions, is using dendrimer templates [15] ,[16] ."
[4] "The use of such small particle size is expected to display unique catalytic behavior in many reactions."
[5] "Initial characterization of both the original Pt-DEN made by the colloidal synthesis and the catalysts that result after their dispersion on the silica support was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a FEI-Philips CM300 instrument equipped with an EDAX energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) with a Si/Li detector window [41] ."
[6] "In terms of selectivity, a trade off between butane and 1-butene formation was seen during the conversion of trans-2-butene, with the yields for the latter increasing with temperature at the expense of the former."
[7] "A third observation in agreement with previous research is that oxidation of the Pt-DENs occurs upon thermal treatments in O2 atmospheres (Fig. 2 , Fig. 6 ), and that their reduction to a metallic state and the restitution of their catalytic activity can be achieved upon subsequent treatments with H2 (Fig. 6 )."

1. Colloidal chemistry is adept at synthesizing metal nanoparticles with various well-defined shapes. Controlling the growth of colloidal particles to sizes below 5 nm is challenging, while dendrimer templates can generate nanoparticles of around 12 nm with narrow size distributions, suitable for unique catalytic behavior in many reactions.

2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for initial characterization of the Pt-DENs and catalysts dispersed on silica support. This was done using a FEI-Philips CM300 instrument equipped with an EDAX energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS).

3. There's a trade-off between butane and 1-butene formation during the conversion of trans-2-butene. As the reaction temperature increases, the yield of 1-butene rises at the cost of butane formation.

4. The oxidation of Pt-DENs upon thermal treatments in oxygen atmospheres is confirmed. Reduction to a metallic state and restoration of catalytic activity can be achieved through subsequent hydrogen treatments.

1. 特别是胶体化学，已经证明对于合成具有不同精确形状的金属纳米颗粒非常熟练。控制胶体颗粒生长到5nm以下的尺寸非常困难，而使用树枝状分子模板可以生成直径大约为12nm且粒度分布狭窄的纳米颗粒，这些纳米颗粒在许多反应中表现出独特的催化行为。

2. 初始对Pt-DEN和在硅胶支持上分散的催化剂的表征使用了配备Si/Li探测器窗口的FEI-Philips CM300透射电子显微镜（TEM）结合能量色散X射线光谱仪（EDS）进行。

3. 在异丁烯转化为顺式异丁烯的过程中，存在但烷和1-丁烯形成的权衡。随着反应温度的升高，后者形成的比例增加，而前者则减少。

4. 确认了在氧气气氛下的热处理过程中，Pt-DEN会发生氧化。通过后续氢气处理可以将它们还原为金属状态，并恢复其催化活性。
