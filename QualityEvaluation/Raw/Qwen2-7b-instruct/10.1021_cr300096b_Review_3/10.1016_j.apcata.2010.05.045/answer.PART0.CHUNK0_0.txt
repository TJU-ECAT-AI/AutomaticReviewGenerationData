[1] "In order to activate such catalysts, different treatments were explored. It was shown that heating in vacuum leads to extensive dehydrogenation over a wide range of temperatures, with the most chemistry occurring around 400 K, and to the formation of graphitic deposits, which block access to the metal surface."
[2] "Exposures to oxygen atmospheres at high temperatures burn the organic matter, but also oxidize the platinum particles and therefore render them almost inactive for catalysis."
[3] "Hydrogen treatments, on the other hand, may not fully remove the dendritic material, but still make the catalyst quite active toward hydrocarbon conversion reactions."
[4] "The platinum nanoparticles are quite stable under the conditions of these treatments, and do not start to sinter until treatments with H2 at temperatures above 625 K."
[5] "The hydrogen-activated Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts were tested for the conversion of trans-2-butene in the presence of small amounts of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen pretreatments to temperatures as low as 425 K resulted in catalysts with some activity, but H2 exposures at 475 K or higher temperatures were required to attain maximum catalytic conversion."
[6] "The Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts proved to be particularly selective for the promotion of trans-to-cis isomerization: cis-2-butene amounted to more than half of all the products obtained under the conditions used in our catalytic kinetic experiments."

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts commonly employed include:
1. Heating in vacuum, which causes extensive dehydrogenation of the organic matter, but forms graphitic deposits that obstruct the metal surface.
2. Exposure to oxygen atmospheres at high temperatures, which burns the organic matter but also oxidizes the platinum particles, rendering them inactive for catalysis.
3. Hydrogen treatments, which might not fully remove the dendritic material but still make the catalyst active for hydrocarbon conversion reactions.
4. The stability of the platinum nanoparticles is maintained under these treatments, and they start to sinter at temperatures above 625 K.
5. Hydrogen pretreatments to temperatures as low as 425 K result in catalysts with some activity, but H2 exposures at 475 K or higher temperatures are required to achieve maximum catalytic conversion.
6. The Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts are exceptionally selective for promoting trans-to-cis isomerization, with cis-2-butene comprising more than half of all products obtained under the conditions used in catalytic kinetic experiments.

对于支持双金属催化剂的合成方法通常包括：
1. 在真空中的加热，导致有机物质的广泛脱氢化，但形成了阻碍金属表面的石墨沉积物。
2. 高温下的氧气气氛暴露，燃烧了有机物质，但也氧化了铂颗粒，使其对催化作用无效。
3. 氢处理，可能不能完全去除树状材料，但仍使催化剂对烃类转化反应具有活性。
4. 在这些处理条件下，铂纳米颗粒保持稳定，直到在高于625K的氢气处理下开始熔结。
5. 温度低至425K的氢前处理导致催化剂有一定程度的活性，但需要在475K或更高温度下进行H2暴露以达到最大催化转换。
6. Pt-DEN/SiO2催化剂特别适用于促进转到顺转化，顺-2-丁烯占所有在使用催化动力学实验条件获得的产品超过一半。
