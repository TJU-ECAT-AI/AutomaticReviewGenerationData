[1] "In order to activate such catalysts, different treatments were explored. It was shown that heating in vacuum leads to extensive dehydrogenation over a wide range of temperatures, with the most chemistry occurring around 400 K, and to the formation of graphitic deposits, which block access to the metal surface."
[2] "Exposures to oxygen atmospheres at high temperatures burn the organic matter, but also oxidize the platinum particles and therefore render them almost inactive for catalysis."
[3] "Hydrogen treatments, on the other hand, may not fully remove the dendritic material, but still make the catalyst quite active toward hydrocarbon conversion reactions."
[4] "The platinum nanoparticles are quite stable under the conditions of these treatments, and do not start to sinter until treatments with H2 at temperatures above 625 K."
[5] "The hydrogen-activated Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts were tested for the conversion of trans-2-butene in the presence of small amounts of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen pretreatments to temperatures as low as 425 K resulted in catalysts with some activity, but H2 exposures at 475 K or higher temperatures were required to attain maximum catalytic conversion."
[6] "The Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts proved to be particularly selective for the promotion of trans-to-cis isomerization: cis-2-butene amounted to more than half of all the products obtained under the conditions used in our catalytic kinetic experiments."

1. Heating in vacuum, which causes extensive dehydrogenation of the organic matter, but forms graphitic deposits that obstruct the metal surface.
2. Exposure to oxygen atmospheres at high temperatures, which burns the organic matter but also oxidizes the platinum particles, rendering them inactive for catalysis.
3. Hydrogen treatments, which might not fully remove the dendritic material but still make the catalyst active for hydrocarbon conversion reactions.
4. The stability of the platinum nanoparticles is maintained under these treatments, and they start to sinter at temperatures above 625 K.
5. Hydrogen pretreatments to temperatures as low as 425 K result in catalysts with some activity, but H2 exposures at 475 K or higher temperatures are required to achieve maximum catalytic conversion.
6. The Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts are exceptionally selective for promoting trans-to-cis isomerization, with cis-2-butene comprising more than half of all products obtained under the conditions used in catalytic kinetic experiments.

[1] "Colloidal chemistry in particular has proven quite adept to the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with different well-defined shapes [12] ,[13] ,[14]."
[2] "Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to control the growth of colloidal particles to sizes below 5 nm."
[3] "An alternative way to grow small nanoparticles, with diameter of the order of 12 nm and narrow size distributions, is using dendrimer templates [15] ,[16] ."
[4] "The use of such small particle size is expected to display unique catalytic behavior in many reactions."
[5] "Initial characterization of both the original Pt-DEN made by the colloidal synthesis and the catalysts that result after their dispersion on the silica support was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a FEI-Philips CM300 instrument equipped with an EDAX energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) with a Si/Li detector window [41] ."
[6] "In terms of selectivity, a trade off between butane and 1-butene formation was seen during the conversion of trans-2-butene, with the yields for the latter increasing with temperature at the expense of the former."
[7] "A third observation in agreement with previous research is that oxidation of the Pt-DENs occurs upon thermal treatments in O2 atmospheres (Fig. 2 , Fig. 6 ), and that their reduction to a metallic state and the restitution of their catalytic activity can be achieved upon subsequent treatments with H2 (Fig. 6 )."

1. Colloidal chemistry is adept at synthesizing metal nanoparticles with various well-defined shapes. Controlling the growth of colloidal particles to sizes below 5 nm is challenging, while dendrimer templates can generate nanoparticles of around 12 nm with narrow size distributions, suitable for unique catalytic behavior in many reactions.

2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for initial characterization of the Pt-DENs and catalysts dispersed on silica support. This was done using a FEI-Philips CM300 instrument equipped with an EDAX energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS).

3. There's a trade-off between butane and 1-butene formation during the conversion of trans-2-butene. As the reaction temperature increases, the yield of 1-butene rises at the cost of butane formation.

4. The oxidation of Pt-DENs upon thermal treatments in oxygen atmospheres is confirmed. Reduction to a metallic state and restoration of catalytic activity can be achieved through subsequent hydrogen treatments.

2. 初始对Pt-DEN和在硅胶支持上分散的催化剂的表征使用了配备Si/Li探测器窗口的FEI-Philips CM300透射电子显微镜（TEM）结合能量色散X射线光谱仪（EDS）进行。

3. 在异丁烯转化为顺式异丁烯的过程中，存在但烷和1-丁烯形成的权衡。随着反应温度的升高，后者形成的比例增加，而前者则减少。

4. 确认了在氧气气氛下的热处理过程中，Pt-DEN会发生氧化。通过后续氢气处理可以将它们还原为金属状态，并恢复其催化活性。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are colloidal chemistry and dendrimer templating. Colloidal chemistry allows for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with various well-defined shapes, which can then be dispersed onto a high-surface-area support. Dendrimer templating involves using a dendrimer as a template to encapsulate metal nanoparticles, which are then dispersed onto a support. These methods offer potential advantages such as precise control over the size and shape of the nanoparticles, leading to catalysts with enhanced performance and selectivity in hydrocarbon conversion reactions. In the context of the literature, colloidal chemistry was employed to synthesize Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in a PAMAM dendrimer, which were subsequently dispersed onto a silica support to create a supported catalyst. This method was found to yield catalysts with well-defined Pt nanoparticles (average 1.5 nm in diameter) that showed high activity and selectivity for olefin conversion reactions, particularly in promoting cis-to-trans isomerization.

The synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts typically involves the use of colloidal chemistry and self-assembly approaches. These methods enable the precise control of the size and shape of metal nanoparticles, which is advantageous for achieving high selectivity in catalytic reactions. The literature describes the use of fourth-generation hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as templates for synthesizing Pt nanoparticles encapsulated within them (Pt-DENs). These Pt-DENs are then dispersed onto a homemade solgel silica support through wetness impregnation. The TEM analysis confirms the uniformity of the nanoparticles' size and shape. The study also highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate activation method, as treatments in vacuum or oxygen can lead to unwanted side effects. The most effective activation method identified was hydrogen pretreatment, which maintains the nanoparticles' size and shape while enhancing the catalyst's activity. The Pt-DEN/SiO2 catalysts demonstrate high selectivity for the conversion of trans-2-butene to cis-2-butene, making them particularly suitable for olefin isomerization reactions.

支持双金属催化剂的合成通常采用胶体化学和自组装方法。这些方法能够精确控制金属纳米颗粒的大小和形状，这对于在催化反应中实现高选择性非常有利。文献描述了使用第四代羟基终止聚（亚胺）胺（PAMAM）树状大分子作为模板来合成包覆在其中的铂纳米粒子（Pt-DEN）。然后将这些Pt-DEN分散到自制溶胶硅酸盐载体上，通过湿浸润法。透射电子显微镜分析证实了纳米粒子大小和形状的一致性。研究还强调了选择合适激活方法的重要性，真空或氧气处理可能会带来不利影响。最有效的激活方法是氢前处理，它既能保持纳米粒子的大小和形状，又能增强催化剂的活性。Pt-DEN/SiO2催化剂对反式2-丁烯转化为顺式2-丁烯显示出极高的选择性，特别适合于烯烃异构化反应。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the use of templates such as dendrimers to create well-defined nanoparticles. These nanoparticles, typically with diameters of 1.5 nanometers and containing around 40 platinum atoms, are dispersed on a silica support. The methods for activating the catalysts include treatments with hydrogen, which leads to the creation of active and selective catalysts for the conversion of trans olefins to cis counterparts. This contrasts with treatments in vacuum or with oxygen, which are deemed unacceptable due to the deposition of graphitic material and metal oxidation, respectively. The size of the particles is crucial, as small particles display unique rough surfaces and electronic properties that are beneficial for certain catalytic reactions. This research extends the understanding of catalyst selectivity by investigating the impact of particle size on olefin conversion reactions.
