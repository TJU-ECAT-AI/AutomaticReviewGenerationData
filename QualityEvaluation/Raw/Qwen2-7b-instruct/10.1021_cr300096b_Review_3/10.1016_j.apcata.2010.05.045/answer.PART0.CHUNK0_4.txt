[1] "Well-defined platinum-based catalysts were prepared using fourth-generation hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as templates."
[2] "Nanoparticles with an average of 40 Pt atoms and an average diameter of 1.5 nm were produced this way, and dispersed on a homemade solgel silica support."
[3] "A combination of electron microscopy, infrared absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and catalytic kinetic measurements were used to investigate the effect of those treatments on the decomposition and elimination of the material associated with the dendrimer and on the activity and selectivity of the resulting catalysts."
[4] "Neither heating in vacuum nor burning with oxygen was deemed acceptable, because much graphitic material is deposited with the former treatment and metal oxidation is induced by the latter."
[5] "Hydrogen pretreatments, on the other hand, lead to fairly active catalysts with high selectivity for the conversion of trans olefins to their cis counterparts."
[6] "Colloidal chemistry in particular has proven quite adept to the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with different well-defined shapes."
[7] "It has been traditionally believed that this mild and mechanistically subtle reaction is not affected by the structure of the surface of the catalyst."
[8] "As an extension of that work, we are now turning our attention to the effect of particle size, since small platinum particles display unique rough surfaces and also particular electronic properties bordering on those expected from discrete molecular structures."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the use of templates such as dendrimers to create well-defined nanoparticles. These nanoparticles, typically with diameters of 1.5 nanometers and containing around 40 platinum atoms, are dispersed on a silica support. The methods for activating the catalysts include treatments with hydrogen, which leads to the creation of active and selective catalysts for the conversion of trans olefins to cis counterparts. This contrasts with treatments in vacuum or with oxygen, which are deemed unacceptable due to the deposition of graphitic material and metal oxidation, respectively. The size of the particles is crucial, as small particles display unique rough surfaces and electronic properties that are beneficial for certain catalytic reactions. This research extends the understanding of catalyst selectivity by investigating the impact of particle size on olefin conversion reactions.

常用的制备双金属催化剂的方法是使用模板如树状大分子来合成定义明确的纳米颗粒。这些颗粒通常直径为1.5纳米，包含约40个铂原子，并分散在硅胶支持体上。激活催化剂的方法包括氢处理，这会产生对转烯烃转化为顺式产物具有高选择性的活性催化剂。这种方法与在真空或氧气下的处理形成对比，后者被认为不可接受，因为前者会导致沉积石墨材料，而后者会引发金属氧化。颗粒大小至关重要，因为较小的颗粒显示出独特的粗糙表面和接近离域分子结构的电子性质，这些性质对某些催化反应有利。这项研究扩展了对催化剂选择性的理解，通过探究颗粒尺寸对烯烃转化反应的影响。
