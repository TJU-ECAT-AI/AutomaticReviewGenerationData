[1] "The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be well tuned by varying the size, composition and atomic ordering."
[2] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts."
[3] "The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."
[4] "In the successive two-step reduction approach, it is fairly difficult to obtain the coreshell NPs on the sub-10 nm scale, especially in the absence of a stabilizer/surfactant."
[5] "With the limitation effect of the pore/surface structure of a metalorganic framework (ZIF-8), a new type of porous functional material, we have successfully fabricated Au@Ag NPs within 26 nm without the help of a surfactant by a sequential depositionreduction route for Au and Ag."
[6] "The deposition in a reverse order for Au and Ag also produced similar coreshell nanostructures while the shell was composed of AuAg alloy, caused by the galvanic replacement reaction due to the differences in reduction potentials of the two soluble metal salts."

1. Commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs, and utilizing the limitation effect of the pore/surface structure of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) for fabrication without surfactants. These methods offer advantages in tailoring the properties of catalysts by controlling the composition, size, and structure of the cores and shells, and potentially reducing the use of surfactants, which can lead to cleaner and more sustainable production processes.

2. The potential advantages of these methods include precise control over the properties of the catalysts, such as improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, due to the tailored structure and composition of the cores and shells. Applications of these bimetallic coreshell catalysts span various fields, including but not limited to, the selective oxidation of alcohols, hydrogenation reactions, and catalytic methane combustion. The overall efficacy in catalyst production is enhanced by these methods, leading to catalysts with optimized performance for specific reactions.
