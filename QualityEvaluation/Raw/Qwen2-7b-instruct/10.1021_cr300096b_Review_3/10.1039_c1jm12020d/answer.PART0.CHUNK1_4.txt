The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include successive reduction or seeded/epitaxial growth, one-step reduction, galvanic replacement reaction, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and others. These methods offer potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Core-shell structured bimetallic NPs typically exhibit significantly higher catalytic activities than monometallic counterparts or alloy NPs. The development of tri- and multi-metallic NPs for catalysis, particularly in electrochemical catalysis, is a rapidly growing field. The synergistic catalytic effect over heterometallic NPs is attributed to microstructure changes, electronic interaction, modification of electronic structure, indirect functions of components, and changes in predominant reaction pathways.

用于制备支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括连续还原或种子/晶面生长、一步还原、电沉积替代反应、表面相分离、物理混合等。这些方法在催化剂生产中提供了潜在的优势、应用和整体效率。具有核壳结构的双金属NPs通常表现出比单金属或合金NPs显著更高的催化活性。三金属和多金属NPs在催化领域的开发，特别是电化学催化领域，是一个非常热门的话题。异金属NPs的协同催化效果可归因于微结构变化、不同组件之间的电子相互作用、电子结构的修改、成分间接功能以及主导反应路径的变化。
