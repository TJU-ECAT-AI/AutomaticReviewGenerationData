[1] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
[2] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
[3] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
[4] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism."
[5] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the one-step seeding-growth route, galvanic replacement reaction, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and successive reduction. These methods have potential advantages such as simplicity, efficiency, and ability to control the structure of the catalyst. However, their overall efficacy depends on the specific reaction, the type of metals used, and the desired properties of the final product. The one-step seeding-growth route allows for the formation of coreshell structures by exploiting the differential reduction potentials of the metal salts, while the galvanic replacement reaction facilitates the formation of hollow interiors in the catalysts. Surface phase segregation and physical mixing offer ways to create alloys or coreshell structures by manipulating the reaction conditions. Successive reduction enables the controlled growth of one component on top of another. The choice of synthesis method depends on the desired outcome and the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction.

[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."

[4] "The addition of a base increases the activity of all catalysts with various Au/Pd ratios, and the extent of the enhancement is dependent on the nature of the alcohol to be oxidized and on the Au/Pd ratio."
[5] "The synergistic effect between Au and Pd was obvious: the hydrogen production was enhanced by ca. 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt% Ni-only catalyst and ca. 60 times higher hydrogen production rates as compared to 0.5 wt% Pt catalyst."
[6] "By optimizing the calcination and reduction pre-treatment conditions for PtCo/YSZ, the CO concentration can be decreased below 10 ppm in the temperature range of 380423 K."
[7] "The AuCu NPs in the confined space of SBA-15 showed much better performance than monometallic NPs in catalyzing CO oxidation even with the rich presence of H2."
[8] "The synergistic effect between Ni and Ag led to improvement of dispersion and reactivity of Ni in the presence of Ag for precipitated catalysts although Ag was inactive in the reaction."
[9] "The synergistic effect of Pt and Ir with respect to HI decomposition was confirmed by the fact that the bimetallic PtIr/C catalyst with 1 wt% and 0.77 wt%, respectively for Pt and Ir loadings showed much higher catalytic activity and thermostability compared with Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts."

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation, co-reduction, and deposition-reduction. Impregnation involves soaking the support material in a solution containing the metal precursors. Co-reduction combines the reduction of two metal precursors simultaneously. Deposition-reduction involves depositing one metal on the support, then reducing it, followed by depositing and reducing the second metal. The deposition-reduction method is advantageous for fabricating coreshell nanostructures because it allows for precise control over the size and composition of the core and shell. The galvanic replacement reaction during the deposition-reduction process can lead to the formation of alloy shells, enhancing the catalytic properties.
