[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts."
[2] "We classify and discuss the synergistic catalysis over plentiful nanoalloys according to their compositions as follows."
[3] "In the successive two-step reduction approach, it is fairly difficult to obtain the coreshell NPs on the sub-10 nm scale, especially in the absence of a stabilizer/surfactant."
[4] "The deposition in a reverse order for Au and Ag also produced similar coreshell nanostructures while the shell was composed of AuAg alloy, caused by the galvanic replacement reaction due to the differences in reduction potentials of the two soluble metal salts (EAg+/Ag = +0.80 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au = +0.93 eV vs.SHE)."

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation, co-reduction, and deposition-reduction. Impregnation involves soaking the support material in a solution containing the metal precursors. Co-reduction combines the reduction of two metal precursors simultaneously. Deposition-reduction involves depositing one metal on the support, then reducing it, followed by depositing and reducing the second metal. The deposition-reduction method is advantageous for fabricating coreshell nanostructures because it allows for precise control over the size and composition of the core and shell. The galvanic replacement reaction during the deposition-reduction process can lead to the formation of alloy shells, enhancing the catalytic properties.

合成双金属催化剂的方法包括浸渍、共还原和沉积还原。浸渍是将支持材料浸泡在含有金属前体的溶液中。共还原是同时还原两种金属前体。沉积还原涉及在支持材料上沉积一种金属，然后对其进行还原，接着沉积并还原第二种金属。沉积还原方法对于制备核壳纳米结构具有优势，因为它允许对核心和壳层的大小和组成进行精确控制。沉积还原过程中的电化学置换反应可能导致合金壳层的形成，从而增强催化性能。
