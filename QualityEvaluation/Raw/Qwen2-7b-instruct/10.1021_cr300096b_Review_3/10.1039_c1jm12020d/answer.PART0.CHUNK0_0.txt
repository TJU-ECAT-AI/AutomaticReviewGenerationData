[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."
[2] "We classify and discuss the synergistic catalysis over plentiful nanoalloys according to their compositions as follows."
[3] "For example, the AuPd alloy NPs supported on AC with AuPd compositions ranging from 90:10 to 60:40 are also very active in the liquid-phase oxidation of alcohols such as benzylic alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, octenol and octanol, confirming the high synergistic effect of the alloy."
[4] "The addition of a base increases the activity of all catalysts with various Au/Pd ratios, and the extent of the enhancement is dependent on the nature of the alcohol to be oxidized and on the Au/Pd ratio."
[5] "The synergistic effect between Au and Pd was obvious: the hydrogen production was enhanced by ca. 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt% Ni-only catalyst and ca. 60 times higher hydrogen production rates as compared to 0.5 wt% Pt catalyst."
[6] "By optimizing the calcination and reduction pre-treatment conditions for PtCo/YSZ, the CO concentration can be decreased below 10 ppm in the temperature range of 380423 K."
[7] "The AuCu NPs in the confined space of SBA-15 showed much better performance than monometallic NPs in catalyzing CO oxidation even with the rich presence of H2."
[8] "The synergistic effect between Ni and Ag led to improvement of dispersion and reactivity of Ni in the presence of Ag for precipitated catalysts although Ag was inactive in the reaction."
[9] "The synergistic effect of Pt and Ir with respect to HI decomposition was confirmed by the fact that the bimetallic PtIr/C catalyst with 1 wt% and 0.77 wt%, respectively for Pt and Ir loadings showed much higher catalytic activity and thermostability compared with Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts."
[10] "The synergistic effect of the bimetallic system was found to improve the performance of selective catalytic reduction of NO and reduce the cost for Pt group metal-based catalysts."
