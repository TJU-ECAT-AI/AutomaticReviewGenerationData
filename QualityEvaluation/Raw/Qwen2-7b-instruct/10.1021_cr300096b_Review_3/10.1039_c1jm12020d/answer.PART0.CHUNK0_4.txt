[1] "Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts. The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."
[2] "We classify and discuss the synergistic catalysis over plentiful nanoalloys according to their compositions as follows."
[3] "The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective. To this end, however, a second metal must be deposited on the surface of the pre-formed particles, and the pre-formed metal NPs should be chemically surrounded by the deposited element."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve direct reduction, impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol-gel processes. Each method has its own set of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Direct reduction allows for the immediate formation of metal particles, offering control over particle size and shape. Impregnation involves soaking metal precursors into a support material, facilitating the distribution of metals across the surface. Co-precipitation combines the reduction of two or more metals simultaneously, ensuring uniform particle size and composition. Sol-gel processes convert metal-containing solutions into solid materials through hydrolysis and condensation, enabling precise control over the catalyst's structure and properties.

常用的双金属催化剂合成方法包括直接还原、浸渍、共沉淀和溶胶凝胶法。每种方法都有其优势、应用范围和整体效能。直接还原可以立即形成金属颗粒，提供对颗粒大小和形状的控制。浸渍是将金属前体浸泡在支撑材料中，以促进金属在整个表面的分布。共沉淀是同时还原两种或更多金属，确保均匀的颗粒大小和组成。溶胶凝胶过程通过水解和缩聚将含有金属的溶液转化为固体材料，允许精确控制催化剂的结构和性质。
