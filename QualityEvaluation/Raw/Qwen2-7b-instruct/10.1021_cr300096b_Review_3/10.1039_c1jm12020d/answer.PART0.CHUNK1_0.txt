[1] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
[2] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."
[3] "Most recently, Huang et al. have used bayberry tannin (BT), a natural plant polyphenol, as a reducing agent for the one-step synthesis of Au@Pd coreshell NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature."
[4] "In the ODA solvent, M2+ (M = Co, Ni) cannot be reduced whereas Au3+ and M2+ can be co-reduced based on the following reduction mechanism."
[5] "Importantly, it is feasible to adjust the morphology of the Pd shell by varying the Pd2+/Au3+ molar ratio, where Au@Pd NPs with a spherical Pd shell are formed when the Pd2+ amount is insufficient, whereas NPs with a cubic Pd shell are formed when Pd2+ is sufficient."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the one-step seeding-growth route, galvanic replacement reaction, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and successive reduction. These methods have potential advantages such as simplicity, efficiency, and ability to control the structure of the catalyst. However, their overall efficacy depends on the specific reaction, the type of metals used, and the desired properties of the final product. The one-step seeding-growth route allows for the formation of coreshell structures by exploiting the differential reduction potentials of the metal salts, while the galvanic replacement reaction facilitates the formation of hollow interiors in the catalysts. Surface phase segregation and physical mixing offer ways to create alloys or coreshell structures by manipulating the reaction conditions. Successive reduction enables the controlled growth of one component on top of another. The choice of synthesis method depends on the desired outcome and the specific requirements of the catalytic reaction.

常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法包括一步种子生长法、电镀替代反应、表面相分离、物理混合和连续还原。这些方法具有简化操作、提高效率和控制催化剂结构等潜在优势。然而，它们的整体效果取决于特定反应、使用的金属类型以及最终产品的期望性质。一步种子生长法通过利用金属盐的差分还原势来形成核壳结构，而电镀替代反应则促进了催化剂内部空心结构的形成。表面相分离和物理混合提供了一种通过调整反应条件来创建合金或核壳结构的方式。连续还原允许在另一个成分上进行受控生长。选择合成方法取决于预期结果和催化反应的具体要求。
