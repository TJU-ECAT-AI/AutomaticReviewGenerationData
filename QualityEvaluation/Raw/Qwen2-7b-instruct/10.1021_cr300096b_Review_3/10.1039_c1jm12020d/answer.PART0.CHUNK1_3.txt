[1] "Bimetallic alloy NPs have been widely developed with improved catalytic activity. For coreshell structured bimetallic NPs, we have introduced some fabrication strategies, including typical successive reduction or seeded/epitaxial growth, one-step reduction, galvanic replacement reaction, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and so on."
[2] "In recent years, the development of tri- and multi-metallic NPs for catalysis, especially electrochemical catalysis, is becoming a very hot topic. The combination of relatively cheap components with less noble metal into one catalyst affords more opportunities to lower cost and improve catalytic efficiency."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include successive reduction, seeded/epitaxial growth, one-step reduction, galvanic replacement reaction, surface phase segregation, physical mixing, and others. These methods offer improved catalytic activity. The development of tri- and multi-metallic NPs for catalysis, especially in electrochemical catalysis, is a growing field, aiming to combine cheaper, less noble metals to reduce costs and enhance catalytic efficiency.
