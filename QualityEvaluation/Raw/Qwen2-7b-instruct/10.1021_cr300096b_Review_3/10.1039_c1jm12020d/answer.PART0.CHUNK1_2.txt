[1] "Our group reported a rational strategy for fabricating magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs through the one-step seeding-growth route at room temperature under ambient atmosphere within a few minutes."
[2] "The one-step synthetic method was achieved by exposing a mixture of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to the reducing agent NH3BH3 simultaneously, where Co2+ cannot be reduced while Au NPs can be formed first by reduction of Au3+ with NH3BH3 and then act as a catalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 to afford active H species."
[3] "Therefore, the basic concept of this one-step synthesis of the Au@Co coreshell NPs is to take advantage of the different reduction potentials of the two metal salts (ECo2+/Co = 0.28 eV vs.SHE; EAu3+/Au+ = 0.93 eV vs.SHE), where NH3BH3 as a moderate reducing agent is essential."

The most commonly utilized synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is the one-step seeding-growth route, as exemplified by the fabrication of magnetically recyclable Au@Co coreshell NPs. This method allows for the simultaneous exposure of Au3+ and Co2+ precursors to a reducing agent, in this case, NH3BH3. The different reduction potentials of Au3+ and Co2+ enable Au nanoparticles to form first, which then act as a catalyst for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of NH3BH3, generating active H species. This process is made possible by the moderate reducing capability of NH3BH3, which is crucial for the synthesis of Au@Co coreshell NPs.

最常用的制备双金属催化剂的方法是一步种子生长法，以我们小组报道的制备磁性可回收的Au@Co核壳NPs为例。这种方法通过同时将Au3+和Co2+前体暴露于还原剂NH3BH3来实现。不同的是，Au3+和Co2+的还原电势使得Au纳米粒子首先形成，并且随后作为催化剂进行NH3BH3的水解脱氢，产生活性H物种。这个过程得益于NH3BH3中等的还原能力，对于Au@Co核壳NPs的合成至关重要。
