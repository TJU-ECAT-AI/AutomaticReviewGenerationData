The literature focuses on the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt3dPt (111) and Pt3dPt (100) bimetallic structures. It does not directly address the most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts, nor does it compare these methods in terms of potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production.
