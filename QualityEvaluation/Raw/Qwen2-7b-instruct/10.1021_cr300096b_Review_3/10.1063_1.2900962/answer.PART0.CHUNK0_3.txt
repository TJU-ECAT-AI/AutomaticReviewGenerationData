The research primarily focuses on the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt3dPt(111) and Pt3dPt(100) bimetallic structures. It employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations and examines the predicted effect of crystal plane on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the stability of the subsurface structure in these bimetallic systems exposed to oxygen.
