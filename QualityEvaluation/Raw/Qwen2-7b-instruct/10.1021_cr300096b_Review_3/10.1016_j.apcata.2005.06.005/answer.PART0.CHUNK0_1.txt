[1] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "Some recent papers have dealt with the use of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of iso-butane."
[3] "In the field of selective hydrogenations, Consonni et al. have studied Pt/ZnO catalysts in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, and they concluded that the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol) increased with the extent of alloy formation."
[4] "Furthermore, ZnO has n-type semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction between platinum and ZnO can be expected."
[5] "It has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K."
[6] "The results were explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal."
[7] "The use of zinc as promoter or support for selective hydrogenation reactions is not limited to platinum catalysts."
[8] "Au/ZnO catalysts were also selective for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[9] "The superior performance of Au/ZnO catalysts was explained by the formation of interfacial sites adjacent to Au particles that can activate the reactant and facilitate its hydrogenation."
[10] "For this latter reaction, it has been shown that the catalytic performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and tin species, both in the metallic state and in oxidised states."
[11] "Furthermore, ZnO has n-type semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction between platinum and ZnO can be expected."
[12] "The chemical surface analysis of the catalysts, both in fresh and reduced states, was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[13] "The TPR profile obtained with the monometallic Pt/C catalyst shows a broad hydrogen consumption band centred at about 570 K, which can be ascribed to the reduction of Pt(II) species to metallic Pt."
[14] "As the amount of platinum in this catalyst is nearly the same than in the monometallic catalyst, for which a much lower reduction peak was detected, we ascribe this intense reduction peak to the joint reduction of platinum and zinc species."
[15] "The oxidation state of zinc in these catalyst cannot be elucidated by XPS analysis on the basis of the binding energy of the Zn 2p3/2 transition, due to the close appearance of bands corresponding to Zn(II) and metallic Zn species."
[16] "After reduction at 773 K, the most intense band appears at 71.4 eV in all cases, thus indicating the reduction of platinum to the metallic state."
[17] "Although the TPR experiment showed the reduction of Zn(II) species at a temperature lower than 773 K, no clear evidences of the presence of metallic Zn could be found in the AES results."
[18] "The lower CO chemisorption capacity for the bimetallic catalyst could be due to: (i) larger platinum particles; (ii) partial surface coverage of platinum particles by zinc species; and (iii) formation of bimetallic PtZn particles, in which surface platinum is diluted by zinc atoms."
[19] "It seems clear that zinc weakens the interaction of CO with the surface platinum atoms, at least with the main part of them, and this can be originated by the coverage of the strongest adsorption sites by zinc, but also by the weakening of the adsorption sites by a ligand effect caused by alloy formation."
[20] "In the case of PtNi/TiO2, Ea(app) increased from 29 to 54 kJ mol1 when the nickel loading was increased and, at the same time, the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol decreased."
[21] "Similarly, the Ea(app) reported for the monometallic Pt/Carbon black catalyst, 31 kJ mol1, was higher than that for the bimetallic PtSn/Carbon black sample, 18 kJ mol1, which showed a higher selectivity."
[22] "In the case of Pt/ZnO catalysts, up to 85% selectivity to crotyl alcohol was obtained with the catalyst prepared from H2PtCl6 in which the formation of bimetallic PtZn particles were detected."
[23] "This catalytic behaviour was ascribed to both an effect of alloy formation and to a promoter effect by chlorine, which would increase the support Lewis acidity and influence the electronic properties of the metal particles."
[24] "Furthermore, it has also to be taken into account the differences in the experimental conditions with, for example, a crotonaldehyde partial pressure of only 8 Torr versus 28 Torr in this study."
[25] "Thus, the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles (based on TPR and microcalorimetry results) reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles, suppresses the undesired reactions and enhances selectivity and stability."
[26] "Deactivation in this kind of reactions is due to side reactions (mainly isomerization and cracking) which produce blocking of active sites by coke deposition."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include sequential impregnation, where a second non-active metal is added to a previously dried support, and direct co-impregnation, where the metals are introduced simultaneously. These methods offer potential advantages such as controlled metal loading, flexibility in metal selection, and the ability to tailor the catalyst properties for specific applications. Their overall efficacy in catalyst production depends on factors including the desired metal composition, the support material, the reaction conditions, and the intended application.

2. The synthesis methods can vary significantly in their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy based on several criteria. Sequential impregnation typically offers better control over metal distribution and loading, making it suitable for applications requiring precise metal ratios. Direct co-impregnation, on the other hand, might be more advantageous for reactions where the proximity of metals plays a crucial role in the catalytic process, such as in the formation of alloy phases or intermetallic compounds. The choice of method should align with the specific requirements of the catalyst, including the need for enhanced selectivity, stability, or activity in the targeted reaction.

3. In the context of the literature provided, the synthesis methods utilized for supported bimetallic catalysts involve sequential impregnation. This method involves depositing one metal onto the support, allowing for the evaporation of excess solvent, and then depositing the second metal. This approach enables the control of metal loading and composition, facilitating the creation of bimetallic particles that can exhibit unique catalytic properties. The effectiveness of these methods is influenced by parameters such as the choice of metals, support materials, reaction conditions, and the desired outcome in terms of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.
