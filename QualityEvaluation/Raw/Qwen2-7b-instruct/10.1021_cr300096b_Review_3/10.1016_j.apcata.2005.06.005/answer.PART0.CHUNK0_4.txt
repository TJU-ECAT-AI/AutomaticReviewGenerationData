[1] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "Some recent papers have dealt with the use of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of iso-butane."
[3] "Pt/Zn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."
[4] "The results were explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal."
[5] "This means that whereas on Pt catalysts, the adsorption trough the CC double bond is highly favoured, on PtZn catalysts, the adsorption of the carbonyl bond on PtZn bridge sites is able to compete with that of the CC double bond."
[6] "The use of zinc as promoter or support for selective hydrogenation reactions is not limited to platinum catalysts."
[7] "Au/ZnO catalysts were also selective for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde."
[8] "The higher selectivity of the bimetallic PtZn/C catalysts towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, as compared with that of the monometallic counterpart (which only produces butanal and light hydrocarbons), can be attributed to the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve adding a second non-active metal to a noble metal to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds. This approach aims to enhance the catalytic behavior of the noble metal, particularly in heterogeneous catalysis. Methods like impregnation with metal precursors and subsequent reduction treatments are used to prepare these catalysts.

2. Synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts have various advantages depending on their intended applications and overall efficacy. These methods can lead to improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. By forming alloy phases or intermetallic compounds, bimetallic catalysts can exhibit distinct catalytic behaviors, making them suitable for a wide range of chemical transformations.

3. The effectiveness of synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts is largely determined by factors such as the choice of metals, the preparation technique, and the support material used. For instance, impregnation with metal precursors and subsequent reduction treatments are common, and the presence of the noble metal can favor the formation of alloy phases, enhancing the catalytic performance. The specific method chosen depends on the desired properties of the catalyst, such as activity, selectivity, and stability, as well as the nature of the chemical reactions involved.
