The synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts typically involves impregnation methods, where a solution of the metal precursors is applied to the support material. These methods can offer advantages such as precise control over metal loading and particle size. The literature discusses various bimetallic systems including Pt-Sn, Pt-Zn, and Au/ZnO catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions. The effectiveness of these catalysts often depends on factors such as the atomic ratio of the metals, the preparation method, and the interaction between the metals, especially when one metal forms an alloy with the noble metal. Zinc, due to its n-type semiconductor character, can interact strongly with noble metals like platinum, affecting their catalytic behavior. DFT calculations have shown that adding zinc to platinum can weaken the adsorption of olefinic and carbonyl bonds. The use of zinc as a promoter or support in catalysts is not limited to platinum and can enhance selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. Carbonaceous materials, with their high surface area, are increasingly used as supports in bimetallic systems to facilitate the interaction between metals and improve catalytic properties.

在异质催化领域，通过向贵金属添加第二种不活泼金属以形成合金相或互溶化合物来改变其催化行为是一个有趣的研究领域。这些合成方法通常涉及浸渍技术，其中金属前体溶液被施用于载体材料。这种方法提供了精确控制金属负载和颗粒大小的优势。文献中讨论了几种双金属系统，包括Pt-Sn、Pt-Zn和Au/ZnO催化剂，用于选择性氢化反应。这些催化剂的有效性往往取决于金属原子比、制备方法以及金属之间（包括金属状态和氧化状态）的相互作用等因素。由于锌具有n型半导体特性，因此它与铂等贵金属之间可以有很强的相互作用，影响它们的催化性能。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，将锌添加到铂中可以削弱烯烃和羰基键的吸附。锌作为促进剂或支持物在催化剂中的应用不仅局限于铂，而且可以增强氢化反应的选择性。碳基材料因其高比表面积而越来越常被用作双金属体系的载体，以促进金属之间的相互作用并提高催化性能。
