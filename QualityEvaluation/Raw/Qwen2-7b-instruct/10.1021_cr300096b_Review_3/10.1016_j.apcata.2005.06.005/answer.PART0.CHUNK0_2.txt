[1] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve adding a second non-active metal to a noble metal, which can form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds. This approach can lead to distinctive catalytic behavior compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. Supported bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Sn/Al2O3, are widely used in processes like the dehydrogenation of iso-butane. The Pt-Sn system shares similarities with the Pt-Zn system, where platinum and zinc can form alloy phases that exhibit unique catalytic properties.

3. In the context of vapor phase hydrogenation, Pt/ZnO catalysts have been shown to enhance selectivity towards the formation of unsaturated alcohols, like crotyl alcohol, when the extent of alloy formation increases.

4. The introduction of zinc in Pt catalysts leads to enhanced selectivity in the hydrogenation of CO bonds in crotonaldehyde, even though the catalytic activity might be reduced.

5. Pt/ZnO catalysts demonstrate exceptional selectivity in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving up to 99% selectivity at 45% conversion under certain conditions.

6. The formation of PtZn alloy phases after reducing Zn(II) species is favored by the presence of the noble metal, explaining the enhanced selectivity and catalytic behavior of Pt/ZnO catalysts.

7. Au/ZnO catalysts have also shown selectivity for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, achieving selectivities around 70% under specific reaction conditions.
