[1] "The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation, co-precipitation, and coprecipitation followed by reduction."
[2] "In comparison, impregnation involves depositing one metal onto the support and then depositing another metal onto the support in a subsequent step. This method is advantageous because it allows for precise control over the metal loading and the surface area of the catalyst."
[3] "Co-precipitation, on the other hand, involves mixing the metal salts in solution, allowing them to precipitate together onto the support. This method is simpler and less expensive but may lead to less uniform metal distribution."
[4] "Coprecipitation followed by reduction combines the advantages of both impregnation and co-precipitation. It allows for precise control over the metal distribution while reducing the cost associated with co-precipitation."
[5] "These methods are applied in various fields such as selective hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and oxidation reactions. Their efficacy depends on factors like metal composition, support type, and reaction conditions."
