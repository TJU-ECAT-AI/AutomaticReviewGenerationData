[1] "Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed."
[2] "The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S."
[3] "The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3."

1. The document mentions that when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed, there is a strong inhibition of tetralin conversion to decalin. This observation highlights the impact of site competition among aromatic compounds on hydrogenation rates.

2. The presence of fluorine (F) promotes the activity of the catalysts under sulfur conditions. When sulfur is present at a concentration of 1000 ppm in the feed, the activity of the fluorinated catalysts (F-promoted) is significantly higher than that of the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts.

3. The coordination numbers for the Pt/Al2O3, Pt-Pd/Al2O3, and Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3 catalysts are in good alignment with their respective CO uptakes. This suggests that the order of metal dispersion follows the sequence: Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.

1. 当苯并环庚烷或萘存在时，文档指出四氢化萘向十氢化萘的转换受到强烈抑制。这一观察结果强调了芳香化合物之间竞争位点对氢化速率的影响。

2. 文档提到，氟（F）的存在能促进催化剂在硫化物条件下的活性。当硫化物在饲料中以1000 ppm的浓度存在时，含氟催化剂（F促进）的活性显著高于未促进的铂-钯催化剂。

3. Pt/Al2O3、Pt-Pd/Al2O3和Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3三种催化剂的配位数与各自的CO吸收量相匹配。这表明金属分散度的顺序为：Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3。
