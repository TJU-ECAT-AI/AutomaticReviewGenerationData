Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed. Reversible drops in tetralin conversion of almost two orders of magnitude were observed when the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were present in the reactor, even in minute concentrations. That is, tetralin conversion could only be achieved after essentially all the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were converted.

The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S. 

The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.

At the same space velocity (100 h1), the catalyst prepared by aqueous solution, with a higher metal dispersion, exhibited higher hydrogenation activity than the one prepared by ethylene glycol. 

It is important to note that under the high space velocities used in these measurements, the conversion of the sulfur-compound DBT was low, i.e. <20%. Therefore, the concentration of H2S throughout the bed was relatively low.

These results demonstrate the importance of considering the nature of the sulfur compound under the treatment conditions, since the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may be very different from that of the H2S formed from its hydrogenation.

1. The presence of phenanthrene or naphthalene in the feed leads to a significant inhibition of tetralin conversion to decalin. Even at minute concentrations, the conversion of tetralin can only occur after the majority of 2- and 3-ring aromatics are converted.
2. Fluorine (F) promotes the activity of the catalyst under sulfur conditions. On catalysts containing 1000 ppm of sulfur, the F-promoted catalyst showed significantly higher activity compared to the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst.
3. The metal dispersion of the catalysts follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3, correlating with the observed coordination numbers.
4. A catalyst prepared using an aqueous solution showed higher hydrogenation activity compared to one prepared with ethylene glycol, especially at higher metal dispersion levels.
5. Under high space velocities, the conversion of sulfur compounds like DBT was low, resulting in a relatively low concentration of H2S throughout the bed.
6. The nature of the sulfur compound and its conversion under treatment conditions significantly impact the catalyst's activity, as the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may differ from that of hydrogenated sulfur.

1. 当二芳烃或萘存在时，会观察到四氢化萘转化为十氢化萘的显著抑制。即使在微量浓度下，只有在大部分2-和3环芳烃被转化后，才能实现四氢化萘的转化。
2. 氟（F）促进了在含硫条件下催化剂的活性。当硫含量为1000 ppm时，在催化剂上添加氟的催化剂显示出与未添加氟的铂钯催化剂相比显著更高的活性。
3. 催化剂的金属分散度按照Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3的顺序排列，这与观察到的协调数相吻合。
4. 使用水溶液制备的催化剂在高金属分散度时显示出了比使用乙二醇制备的催化剂更高的氢化活性。
5. 在高空速下，硫化合物如DBT的转化率较低，导致床层中H2S的浓度相对较低。
6. 硫化合物的性质及其在处理条件下的转化对催化剂的活性有重大影响，原始硫化合物的毒性可能与氢化硫不同。
