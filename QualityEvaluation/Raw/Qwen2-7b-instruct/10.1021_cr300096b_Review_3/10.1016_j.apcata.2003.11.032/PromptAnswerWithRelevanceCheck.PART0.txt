[1] "The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."
[3] "The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation using ethylene glycol or deionized water. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts became grey after calcinations and were not homogeneous, even within the same pellet."
[4] "The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are incipient wetness impregnation using ethylene glycol or deionized water. These methods differ in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. The addition of fluorine (F) to the catalysts enhances their activity under sulfur conditions. Fluorinated catalysts, such as F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3, exhibit higher activity compared to unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts. The impregnation method affects metal dispersion; the F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by aqueous solution shows higher metal dispersion than the one prepared by ethylene glycol.

[1] "Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed."
[2] "The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S."
[3] "The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3."

1. The document mentions that when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed, there is a strong inhibition of tetralin conversion to decalin. This observation highlights the impact of site competition among aromatic compounds on hydrogenation rates.

2. The presence of fluorine (F) promotes the activity of the catalysts under sulfur conditions. When sulfur is present at a concentration of 1000 ppm in the feed, the activity of the fluorinated catalysts (F-promoted) is significantly higher than that of the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts.

3. The coordination numbers for the Pt/Al2O3, Pt-Pd/Al2O3, and Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3 catalysts are in good alignment with their respective CO uptakes. This suggests that the order of metal dispersion follows the sequence: Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.

1. 当苯并环庚烷或萘存在时，文档指出四氢化萘向十氢化萘的转换受到强烈抑制。这一观察结果强调了芳香化合物之间竞争位点对氢化速率的影响。

2. 文档提到，氟（F）的存在能促进催化剂在硫化物条件下的活性。当硫化物在饲料中以1000 ppm的浓度存在时，含氟催化剂（F促进）的活性显著高于未促进的铂-钯催化剂。

3. Pt/Al2O3、Pt-Pd/Al2O3和Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3三种催化剂的配位数与各自的CO吸收量相匹配。这表明金属分散度的顺序为：Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3。

Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed. Reversible drops in tetralin conversion of almost two orders of magnitude were observed when the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were present in the reactor, even in minute concentrations. That is, tetralin conversion could only be achieved after essentially all the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were converted.

The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S. 

The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.

At the same space velocity (100 h1), the catalyst prepared by aqueous solution, with a higher metal dispersion, exhibited higher hydrogenation activity than the one prepared by ethylene glycol. 

It is important to note that under the high space velocities used in these measurements, the conversion of the sulfur-compound DBT was low, i.e. <20%. Therefore, the concentration of H2S throughout the bed was relatively low.

These results demonstrate the importance of considering the nature of the sulfur compound under the treatment conditions, since the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may be very different from that of the H2S formed from its hydrogenation.

1. The presence of phenanthrene or naphthalene in the feed leads to a significant inhibition of tetralin conversion to decalin. Even at minute concentrations, the conversion of tetralin can only occur after the majority of 2- and 3-ring aromatics are converted.
2. Fluorine (F) promotes the activity of the catalyst under sulfur conditions. On catalysts containing 1000 ppm of sulfur, the F-promoted catalyst showed significantly higher activity compared to the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst.
3. The metal dispersion of the catalysts follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3, correlating with the observed coordination numbers.
4. A catalyst prepared using an aqueous solution showed higher hydrogenation activity compared to one prepared with ethylene glycol, especially at higher metal dispersion levels.
5. Under high space velocities, the conversion of sulfur compounds like DBT was low, resulting in a relatively low concentration of H2S throughout the bed.
6. The nature of the sulfur compound and its conversion under treatment conditions significantly impact the catalyst's activity, as the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may differ from that of hydrogenated sulfur.

3. 催化剂的金属分散度按照Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3的顺序排列，这与观察到的协调数相吻合。
4. 使用水溶液制备的催化剂在高金属分散度时显示出了比使用乙二醇制备的催化剂更高的氢化活性。
5. 在高空速下，硫化合物如DBT的转化率较低，导致床层中H2S的浓度相对较低。
6. 硫化合物的性质及其在处理条件下的转化对催化剂的活性有重大影响，原始硫化合物的毒性可能与氢化硫不同。

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically involve impregnation techniques, such as aqueous impregnation or incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). These methods involve dissolving metal precursors in a solvent and then impregnating them onto the support material. In the context of this study, both ethylene glycol and deionized water were used as solvents for the impregnation process. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the type of support, the metal loading, and the order of impregnation. In this research, the color of the catalysts varied based on the preparation method and the order of metal and additive impregnation. While the specific details of the synthesis methods might differ across various studies and applications, the general approach of using impregnation techniques is commonly utilized in the production of supported bimetallic catalysts.
