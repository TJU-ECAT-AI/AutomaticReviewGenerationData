[1] "A list of the catalysts investigated is presented in Table 1 . The metal weight loadings were adjusted in order to have the same total metal molar fraction in all catalysts."
[2] "The limitation of those studies is that they do not consider reactant competition, which, as we show in this contribution, greatly affects the hydrogenation conversion."
[3] "Overall, the observed TL conversion followed the same trend as metal dispersion."
[4] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are incipient wetness impregnation using ethylene glycol or deionized water. These methods allow for the adjustment of metal weight loadings to ensure the same total metal molar fraction across all catalysts. However, they may not adequately consider reactant competition, which significantly impacts hydrogenation conversion.

2. The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts can vary in terms of potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy based on factors such as the desired metal distribution, catalyst stability, and the specific chemical reactions targeted. Ethylene glycol or deionized water impregnation methods might offer advantages in terms of controlling metal dispersion, but they may not fully address the complexities of reactant competition in certain reactions.

3. In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F demonstrated higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts. This suggests that the addition of fluorine to the catalyst supports can enhance sulfur tolerance and improve overall catalytic performance under sulfur-containing environments.
