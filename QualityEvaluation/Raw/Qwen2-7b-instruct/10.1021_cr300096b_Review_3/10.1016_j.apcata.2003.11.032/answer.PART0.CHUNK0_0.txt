[1] "The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."
[3] "The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation using ethylene glycol or deionized water. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts became grey after calcinations and were not homogeneous, even within the same pellet."
[4] "The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are incipient wetness impregnation using ethylene glycol or deionized water. These methods differ in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. The addition of fluorine (F) to the catalysts enhances their activity under sulfur conditions. Fluorinated catalysts, such as F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3, exhibit higher activity compared to unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts. The impregnation method affects metal dispersion; the F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by aqueous solution shows higher metal dispersion than the one prepared by ethylene glycol.

最常用的制备负载型双金属催化剂的方法是浸渍湿法制备，使用乙二醇或去离子水。这些方法在优势、应用和整体催化剂生产效能方面存在差异。氟化剂（F）的添加可以提高催化剂在硫化物条件下的活性。含氟催化剂，如F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3，比未促进的Pt-Pd催化剂表现出更高的活性。浸渍方法影响金属分散度；通过水溶液制备的F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3催化剂显示出比乙二醇制备的催化剂更高的金属分散度。
