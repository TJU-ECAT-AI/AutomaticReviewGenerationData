[1] "Among the most significant results, a strong inhibition of the tetralin conversion to decalin has been observed when either phenanthrene or naphthalene is present in the feed."
[2] "That is, tetralin conversion could only be achieved after essentially all the 2- and 3-ring aromatics were converted."
[3] "The addition of F has a positive impact on the activity under sulfur. Significantly higher activity was observed on the F-promoted catalyst than on the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst when the feed contained 1000 ppm S."
[4] "The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3."

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically involve impregnation techniques, such as aqueous impregnation or incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). These methods involve dissolving metal precursors in a solvent and then impregnating them onto the support material. In the context of this study, both ethylene glycol and deionized water were used as solvents for the impregnation process. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the type of support, the metal loading, and the order of impregnation. In this research, the color of the catalysts varied based on the preparation method and the order of metal and additive impregnation. While the specific details of the synthesis methods might differ across various studies and applications, the general approach of using impregnation techniques is commonly utilized in the production of supported bimetallic catalysts.

合成方法通常包括浸渍技术，如水溶液浸渍或初始湿润浸渍（IWI）。这些方法涉及将金属前体溶解在溶剂中，然后将其浸渍到支撑材料上。在这个研究中，乙二醇和去离子水都被用作浸渍过程中的溶剂。这些方法的有效性取决于支持物类型、负载量和添加剂的浸渍顺序等因素。在这项研究中，催化剂的颜色根据制备方法和金属及添加剂的浸渍顺序而变化。尽管不同研究和应用的具体细节可能有所不同，但使用浸渍技术通常用于生产支持型双金属催化剂。
