[1] "In the last two decades, pillared layered clays (PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or supports for metal phases."
[2] "Their properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and can be modulated by carefully choosing the different parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus offering a very flexible way to design tailored catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, these materials are quite inexpensive, if compared to zeolites."
[4] "Therefore, their possible use can be extended to a wide range of catalytic reactions, including those related to oil refining and hydrotreating processes."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve utilizing pillared layered clays (PILCs). These methods offer several advantages over zeolites, including complementary properties, modulatable characteristics through various parameters, and lower costs. They are particularly suited for a broad spectrum of catalytic reactions, such as those involved in oil refining and hydrotreating processes.
