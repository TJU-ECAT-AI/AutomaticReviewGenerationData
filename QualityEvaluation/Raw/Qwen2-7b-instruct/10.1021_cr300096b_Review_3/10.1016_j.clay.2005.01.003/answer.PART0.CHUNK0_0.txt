[1] "In the last two decades, pillared layered clays (PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or supports for metal phases."
[2] "Their properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and can be modulated by carefully choosing the different parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus offering a very flexible way to design tailored catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, these materials are quite inexpensive, if compared to zeolites."
[4] "Therefore, their possible use can be extended to a wide range of catalytic reactions, including those related to oil refining and hydrotreating processes."
[5] "New materials having catalytic activity in deep hydrotreating now require:high thio-tolerance;controlled surface acidity, to permit hydrogenolysis/ ring-opening reactions to high molecular weight (HMW) compounds having a high cetane number, but avoiding cracking reactions to low molecular weight (LMW) compounds, outside the diesel range;adjustable mesoporosity, in order to allow the diffusion of such voluminous molecules inside the pores;stability under oxidative regeneration conditions."

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts commonly involve the use of pillared layered clays (PILCs). These materials offer several advantages over zeolites due to their complementary properties and adjustable characteristics through various parameters such as pillaring agent, clay type, particle size, pillaring procedure, and thermal treatment. PILCs are notably more affordable compared to zeolites, making them suitable for a broad spectrum of catalytic applications, particularly in oil refining and hydrotreating processes. For effective catalysts in deep hydrotreating, they must possess high thio-tolerance, controlled surface acidity to facilitate hydrogenolysis/ring-opening reactions on high molecular weight compounds with high cetane numbers, while avoiding cracking reactions on low molecular weight compounds outside the diesel range. Additionally, they should feature adjustable mesoporosity to enable the diffusion of voluminous molecules within the pores and maintain stability under oxidative regeneration conditions.

合成支持双金属催化剂的方法通常涉及使用层状粘土（PILC）。这些材料在与沸石相比时提供了多种优势，因为它们的性质互补，并且可以通过不同的参数（填充剂、粘土类型、颗粒大小、填充过程和热处理）进行调整，从而提供设计定制催化剂的非常灵活的方式。与沸石相比，PILC更便宜，因此适用于广泛的催化反应，特别是石油精炼和氢化处理过程。对于深度氢化处理有效的催化剂，必须具有高硫容忍度，控制表面酸性以允许对高分子量化合物进行氢解/开环反应，具有较高的十六烷值数，同时避免对柴油范围外的低分子量化合物的裂解反应。此外，它们应具有可调的介孔结构，以允许大量分子在孔内扩散，并在氧化再生条件下保持稳定性。
