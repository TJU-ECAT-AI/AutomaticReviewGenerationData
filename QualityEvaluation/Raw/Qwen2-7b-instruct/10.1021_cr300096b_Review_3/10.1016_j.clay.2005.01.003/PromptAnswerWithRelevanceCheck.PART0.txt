[1] "In the last two decades, pillared layered clays (PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or supports for metal phases."
[2] "Their properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and can be modulated by carefully choosing the different parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus offering a very flexible way to design tailored catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, these materials are quite inexpensive, if compared to zeolites."
[4] "Therefore, their possible use can be extended to a wide range of catalytic reactions, including those related to oil refining and hydrotreating processes."
[5] "New materials having catalytic activity in deep hydrotreating now require:high thio-tolerance;controlled surface acidity, to permit hydrogenolysis/ ring-opening reactions to high molecular weight (HMW) compounds having a high cetane number, but avoiding cracking reactions to low molecular weight (LMW) compounds, outside the diesel range;adjustable mesoporosity, in order to allow the diffusion of such voluminous molecules inside the pores;stability under oxidative regeneration conditions."

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts commonly involve the use of pillared layered clays (PILCs). These materials offer several advantages over zeolites due to their complementary properties and adjustable characteristics through various parameters such as pillaring agent, clay type, particle size, pillaring procedure, and thermal treatment. PILCs are notably more affordable compared to zeolites, making them suitable for a broad spectrum of catalytic applications, particularly in oil refining and hydrotreating processes. For effective catalysts in deep hydrotreating, they must possess high thio-tolerance, controlled surface acidity to facilitate hydrogenolysis/ring-opening reactions on high molecular weight compounds with high cetane numbers, while avoiding cracking reactions on low molecular weight compounds outside the diesel range. Additionally, they should feature adjustable mesoporosity to enable the diffusion of voluminous molecules within the pores and maintain stability under oxidative regeneration conditions.

合成支持双金属催化剂的方法通常涉及使用层状粘土（PILC）。这些材料在与沸石相比时提供了多种优势，因为它们的性质互补，并且可以通过不同的参数（填充剂、粘土类型、颗粒大小、填充过程和热处理）进行调整，从而提供设计定制催化剂的非常灵活的方式。与沸石相比，PILC更便宜，因此适用于广泛的催化反应，特别是石油精炼和氢化处理过程。对于深度氢化处理有效的催化剂，必须具有高硫容忍度，控制表面酸性以允许对高分子量化合物进行氢解/开环反应，具有较高的十六烷值数，同时避免对柴油范围外的低分子量化合物的裂解反应。此外，它们应具有可调的介孔结构，以允许大量分子在孔内扩散，并在氧化再生条件下保持稳定性。

[7] "These PILC based catalysts in the hydrogenation of naphthalene under pressure."
[8] "Naphthalene may easily be hydrogenated to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), which can be further, and with higher difficulty, hydrogenated to decahydronaphthalene (decalin) isomers (cis+trans)."
[9] "Cracking reactions of both tetralin and decalin may also occur, giving undesired LMW compounds (mainly gases) that are outside the diesel range."
[10] "On the contrary, useful compounds are those derived from hydrogenolysis/ring-opening pathways and called HMW compounds (mainly alkylcyclohexanes, alkylbenzenes, methylindanes and methylindenes, spyrodecane), having high cetane numbers."

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts are commonly synthesized through a modified pillared layered clay (PILC) process. This method offers flexibility in tailoring catalysts by adjusting parameters such as pillaring agent, clay type, particle size, pillaring procedure, and thermal treatment. Compared to zeolites, PILCs are relatively inexpensive, making them suitable for a broad range of catalytic reactions, including those in oil refining and hydrotreating processes. 

2. The hydrogenation of naphthalene under pressure is a key process in the catalytic tests. This process leads to the formation of tetralin, which can further be hydrogenated to decalin isomers. However, cracking reactions might also occur, producing low molecular weight (LMW) compounds like gases, which are outside the diesel range. The desired products, known as high molecular weight (HMW) compounds, typically include alkylcyclohexanes, alkylbenzenes, methylindanes, methylindenes, and spyrodecane, which have high cetane numbers.

1. 支持双金属催化剂通常通过修改片层粘土（PILC）的过程合成。这种方法可以通过调整参数，如填料剂、粘土类型、颗粒大小、填料过程和热处理，提供定制催化剂的灵活性。与沸石相比，PILC相对便宜，适合广泛范围的催化反应，包括炼油和加氢处理过程。

2. 在压力下对萘的加氢是催化剂测试的关键过程。这一过程导致四氢萘的形成，可以进一步加氢为十氢萘异构体。然而，也可能发生裂解反应，产生低分子量（LMW）化合物，如气体，这些化合物超出柴油范围。预期的产品称为高分子量（HMW）化合物，通常包括烷基环己烷、烷基苯、甲基茚烷、甲基茚烯和环十二烷，具有较高的十六烷值。

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts are commonly synthesized using pillared layered clays (PILCs). These methods offer several advantages over traditional synthesis techniques, including the ability to tailor catalyst properties through careful selection of parameters such as pillaring agent, clay type, particle size, pillaring procedure, and thermal treatment. PILCs are also noted for being more affordable compared to zeolites.

2. The synthesis of PILCs involves modifying existing procedures to create materials with unique properties, such as increased microporosity. In the case mentioned, a montmorillonite was modified to create a material with a specific Al/Ce/Mg atomic ratio, enhancing its suitability for use as a support in catalytic reactions.

3. PILCs are considered suitable for use as supports in various catalytic reactions, including those involved in oil refining and hydrotreating processes. They can replace more expensive materials like dealuminated zeolites and Si/Al MCM-41 types, making them a cost-effective alternative.

4. The use of PILCs as supports for catalysts in these reactions offers several benefits, including the potential for high thio-tolerance, controlled surface acidity for hydrogenolysis/ring-opening reactions, adjustable mesoporosity to facilitate the diffusion of large molecules, and stability under oxidative regeneration conditions.
