[1] "In the last two decades, pillared layered clays (PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or supports for metal phases."
[2] "Their properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and can be modulated by carefully choosing the different parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus offering a very flexible way to design tailored catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, these materials are quite inexpensive, if compared to zeolites."
[4] "Therefore, their possible use can be extended to a wide range of catalytic reactions, including those related to oil refining and hydrotreating processes."
[5] "For this purpose, a Al/Ce/ Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r., pillared montmorillonite with larger than usual micropores was prepared by modifying a known synthetic procedure."
[6] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."
[7] "These PILC based catalysts in the hydrogenation of naphthalene under pressure."
[8] "Naphthalene may easily be hydrogenated to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin), which can be further, and with higher difficulty, hydrogenated to decahydronaphthalene (decalin) isomers (cis+trans)."
[9] "Cracking reactions of both tetralin and decalin may also occur, giving undesired LMW compounds (mainly gases) that are outside the diesel range."
[10] "On the contrary, useful compounds are those derived from hydrogenolysis/ring-opening pathways and called HMW compounds (mainly alkylcyclohexanes, alkylbenzenes, methylindanes and methylindenes, spyrodecane), having high cetane numbers."

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts are commonly synthesized through a modified pillared layered clay (PILC) process. This method offers flexibility in tailoring catalysts by adjusting parameters such as pillaring agent, clay type, particle size, pillaring procedure, and thermal treatment. Compared to zeolites, PILCs are relatively inexpensive, making them suitable for a broad range of catalytic reactions, including those in oil refining and hydrotreating processes. 

2. The hydrogenation of naphthalene under pressure is a key process in the catalytic tests. This process leads to the formation of tetralin, which can further be hydrogenated to decalin isomers. However, cracking reactions might also occur, producing low molecular weight (LMW) compounds like gases, which are outside the diesel range. The desired products, known as high molecular weight (HMW) compounds, typically include alkylcyclohexanes, alkylbenzenes, methylindanes, methylindenes, and spyrodecane, which have high cetane numbers.

1. 支持双金属催化剂通常通过修改片层粘土（PILC）的过程合成。这种方法可以通过调整参数，如填料剂、粘土类型、颗粒大小、填料过程和热处理，提供定制催化剂的灵活性。与沸石相比，PILC相对便宜，适合广泛范围的催化反应，包括炼油和加氢处理过程。

2. 在压力下对萘的加氢是催化剂测试的关键过程。这一过程导致四氢萘的形成，可以进一步加氢为十氢萘异构体。然而，也可能发生裂解反应，产生低分子量（LMW）化合物，如气体，这些化合物超出柴油范围。预期的产品称为高分子量（HMW）化合物，通常包括烷基环己烷、烷基苯、甲基茚烷、甲基茚烯和环十二烷，具有较高的十六烷值。
