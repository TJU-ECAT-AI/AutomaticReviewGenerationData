[1] "In the last two decades, pillared layered clays (PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or supports for metal phases."
[2] "Their properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and can be modulated by carefully choosing the different parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus offering a very flexible way to design tailored catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, these materials are quite inexpensive, if compared to zeolites."
[4] "Therefore PILCs can represent suitable supports for catalysts to be used in these reactions, while replacing the more expensive dealuminated zeolites and Si/Al MCM-41 type materials."
[5] "For this purpose, a Al/Ce/ Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r., pillared montmorillonite with larger than usual micropores was prepared by modifying a known synthetic procedure."

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts are commonly synthesized using pillared layered clays (PILCs). These methods offer several advantages over traditional synthesis techniques, including the ability to tailor catalyst properties through careful selection of parameters such as pillaring agent, clay type, particle size, pillaring procedure, and thermal treatment. PILCs are also noted for being more affordable compared to zeolites.

2. The synthesis of PILCs involves modifying existing procedures to create materials with unique properties, such as increased microporosity. In the case mentioned, a montmorillonite was modified to create a material with a specific Al/Ce/Mg atomic ratio, enhancing its suitability for use as a support in catalytic reactions.

3. PILCs are considered suitable for use as supports in various catalytic reactions, including those involved in oil refining and hydrotreating processes. They can replace more expensive materials like dealuminated zeolites and Si/Al MCM-41 types, making them a cost-effective alternative.

4. The use of PILCs as supports for catalysts in these reactions offers several benefits, including the potential for high thio-tolerance, controlled surface acidity for hydrogenolysis/ring-opening reactions, adjustable mesoporosity to facilitate the diffusion of large molecules, and stability under oxidative regeneration conditions.

1. 支持双金属催化剂通常使用层状粘土基质（PILCs）进行合成。这些方法提供了多种优势，包括通过仔细选择参数（填充剂、粘土类型、颗粒大小、填充过程和热处理）来定制催化剂性质的能力。与沸石相比，PILCs的成本效益更高。

2. PILCs的合成涉及修改现有程序以创建具有独特特性的材料，例如增加微孔体积。在所提及的例子中，制备了一种蒙脱石，其Al/Ce/Mg原子比为50.0/1.0/1.0，增强了其作为催化反应支持物的适用性。

3. PILCs被视为用于各种催化反应的支持物，包括石油精炼和氢化处理过程中的反应。它们可以替代更昂贵的材料，如去铝沸石和Si/Al MCM-41类型，从而成为成本效益更高的替代品。

4. 将PILCs用作催化反应的支持物提供了一系列好处，包括高硫容忍度、控制表面酸性以进行氢解/开环反应、可调整的介孔体积以促进大分子的扩散，以及在氧化再生条件下保持稳定。
