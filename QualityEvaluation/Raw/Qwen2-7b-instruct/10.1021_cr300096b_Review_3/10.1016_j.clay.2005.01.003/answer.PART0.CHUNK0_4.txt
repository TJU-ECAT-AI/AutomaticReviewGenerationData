[1] "In the last two decades, pillared layered clays (PILCs) have been largely used as catalysts and/or supports for metal phases."
[2] "Their properties are complementary to those of zeolites, and can be modulated by carefully choosing the different parameters (pillaring agent, type of clay and particle size, pillaring procedure, thermal treatment), thus offering a very flexible way to design tailored catalysts."
[3] "Moreover, these materials are quite inexpensive, if compared to zeolites."
[4] "Therefore, their possible use can be extended to a wide range of catalytic reactions, including those related to oil refining and hydrotreating processes."
[5] "The removal, within the refinery process, of aromatic hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds from light oil fractions (LCO) coming from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) has received considerable attention in recent years, due to both the increasing demand of diesel fuels and the progressively more strict environmental regulations."
[6] "New materials having catalytic activity in deep hydrotreating now require:high thio-tolerance;controlled surface acidity, to permit hydrogenolysis/ ring-opening reactions to high molecular weight (HMW) compounds having a high cetane number, but avoiding cracking reactions to low molecular weight (LMW) compounds, outside the diesel range;adjustable mesoporosity, in order to allow the diffusion of such voluminous molecules inside the pores;stability under oxidative regeneration conditions."
[7] "For this purpose, a Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r., pillared montmorillonite with larger than usual micropores was prepared by modify- ing a known synthetic procedure."
[8] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts are commonly synthesized through pillared layered clay (PILC) methods, which offer advantages in flexibility and cost-effectiveness compared to zeolites. They can be tailored for various applications, especially in oil refining and hydrotreating processes, requiring high thio-tolerance, controlled surface acidity, adjustable mesoporosity, and stability under oxidative regeneration conditions.

2. The Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r. pillared montmorillonite used in this study was prepared through a modified synthetic procedure, providing a low-cost support for noble metal-containing active phases.

1. 支持双金属催化剂通常通过层状粘土（PILC）方法合成，与沸石相比，这种方法在灵活性和成本效益方面具有优势。它们可以被定制用于各种应用，特别是用于油精炼和氢化处理过程，需要高硫容忍度、可控表面酸性、可调介孔结构以及在氧化再生条件下的稳定性。

2. 本研究中使用的Al/Ce/Mg=50.0/1.0/1.0 a.r.层状蒙脱石是通过修改已知的合成程序制备的，为含贵金属活性相提供了低成本的支撑。
