The typical synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are impregnation, co-precipitation, and sol-gel processes. The impregnation technique facilitates precise control over metal loading and distribution, potentially boosting catalytic efficiency. The co-precipitation approach creates clearly defined particles, providing enhanced stability and reactivity compared to alternative methods. The sol-gel process enables the preparation of highly dispersed metal nanoparticles, contributing to superior catalytic performance.
