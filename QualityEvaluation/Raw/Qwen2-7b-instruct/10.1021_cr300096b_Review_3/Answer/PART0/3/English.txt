The primary synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are thermal evaporation-deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and sol-gel methods. Thermal evaporation-deposition provides significant control over particle size and shape, albeit at higher temperatures. Chemical vapor deposition offers superior control over catalyst composition and morphology, enabling precise customization of the catalyst attributes. Sol-gel methods are flexible, producing catalysts with intricate shapes and structures, yet may have reduced yields compared to alternative techniques.
