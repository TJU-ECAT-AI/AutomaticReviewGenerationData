The most frequently used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are coprecipitation, impregnation, and sol-gel methods. These techniques exhibit different levels of potential benefits, applicability, and overall effectiveness in catalyst manufacturing. Coprecipitation permits accurate control over metal composition and size distribution. Impregnation provides simplicity and adaptability in selecting the supporting material. Sol-gel processes facilitate the creation of a uniform catalyst structure, enhancing its activity and stability.
