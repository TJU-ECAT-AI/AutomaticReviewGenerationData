Incipient wetness impregnation is a traditional approach for preparing supported catalysts by dissolving metal salts in water equivalent to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. However, this method often struggles to maintain narrow particle size distributions. The reverse micelle synthesis method, on the other hand, provides a way to control nanoparticle size, dendrimer encapsulation can encapsulate catalysts, and self-assembly allows for precise control over nanoparticle size and shape. One well-studied model bimetallic system is the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface, which exhibits enhanced hydrogenation activity at low temperatures. The reverse micelle synthesis procedure was adapted from previous work to synthesize uniform, reduced Ni nanoparticles, which were then supported on γ-Al2O3 and deposited with Pt using incipient wetness impregnation.
