Catalyst development involves a series of logical steps aimed at achieving specific objectives, requiring expertise from various scientific and engineering disciplines. Successful processes typically follow a pattern of progression, often involving multiple iterations during commercialization.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include coprecipitation, impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and microemulsion techniques. These methods have distinct advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the catalyst. Coprecipitation offers simplicity and control over particle characteristics, impregnation provides flexibility in support materials and precise control over metal loading, solvothermal synthesis produces highly crystalline and uniform particles, and microemulsion techniques enable the creation of well-dispersed particles with narrow size distributions, enhancing catalyst efficiency and selectivity. The overall efficacy of these methods depends on factors such as the desired particle size, shape, and crystallinity, and the choice of synthesis method also impacts cost-effectiveness and scalability.

Thermal evaporation-impregnation, co-precipitation, and electrodeposition are the most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. Each method offers advantages such as control over particle size and shape, ease of scale-up, and compatibility with various materials. They can be applied in various industrial processes like chemical synthesis, energy conversion, and environmental remediation. The overall efficacy is influenced by factors including specific reaction conditions, metal composition, and support material.

The synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts involves various methods such as incipient wetness impregnation, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer encapsulation, and self-assembly of diblock co-polymers into micelles. Incipient wetness impregnation is a traditional approach for preparing supported catalysts by dissolving metal salts in water equivalent to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. However, this method often struggles to maintain narrow particle size distributions. The reverse micelle synthesis method, on the other hand, provides a way to control nanoparticle size, dendrimer encapsulation can encapsulate catalysts, and self-assembly allows for precise control over nanoparticle size and shape. One well-studied model bimetallic system is the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface, which exhibits enhanced hydrogenation activity at low temperatures. The reverse micelle synthesis procedure was adapted from previous work to synthesize uniform, reduced Ni nanoparticles, which were then supported on γ-Al2O3 and deposited with Pt using incipient wetness impregnation. To achieve a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, a 1.67% weight loading of Pt was measured on the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include co-precipitation, impregnation, and sol-gel techniques. Co-precipitation provides high control over particle size and shape, while impregnation enables precise loading of metals onto the support. Sol-gel processing results in a homogeneous dispersion of metal nanoparticles.
