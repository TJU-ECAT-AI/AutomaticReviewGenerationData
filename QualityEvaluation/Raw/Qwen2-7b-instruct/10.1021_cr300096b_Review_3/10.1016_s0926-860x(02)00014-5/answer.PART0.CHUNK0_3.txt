1. "The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UA) is an important model reaction. In the presence of heterogeneous catalysts both the aldehyde and the olefinic double bond of UA can be hydrogenated [1] ,[2] ."
2. "It has been demonstrated that supported platinum catalysts modified by tin, germanium or iron have much higher selectivities for the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group than the unmodified one [3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ."
3. "This interaction, as shown in Scheme 1 , requires the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, i.e. ionic Snn+ species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface."
4. "In SnO2 supported catalysts a synergism between the oxide and the metal phases has been suggested [9] ,[10] ."
5. "Recently, an alternative reaction mechanism has been put forward [12] suggesting the involvement of PtSnO2 interface in the activation of CO as shown in Scheme 2 ."
6. "Upon using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4 the following Snanch/Pts ratios were obtained: 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively [14] ,[15] ."
7. "In summary, upon using CSRs supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters can be obtained and under optimized conditions the introduction of tin into the support can almost completely be avoided [16] ,[17] ,[18] ."
8. "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ."
9. "In this approach, due to the use of high initial concentration of tin tetraalkyls, high Snanch/Ms ratios (M=Rh, Pt, etc.) were obtained, but a definite amount of tin was also introduced into the support."
10. "The aim of this work is to prove that Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."

1. The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes is an important model reaction in catalysis, often involving both the aldehyde and olefinic double bond being hydrogenated simultaneously.
2. Modified platinum catalysts, such as those containing tin, germanium, or iron, exhibit higher selectivity in hydrogenating the aldehyde group compared to non-modified catalysts.
3. The interaction between tin and platinum, as illustrated in Scheme 1, necessitates the formation of ionic Snnn+Pt ensemble sites, which can be stabilized at the metal site or interface with the support.
4. There is a synergistic relationship between the oxide and metal phases in catalysts containing tin oxide, as suggested in previous studies.
5. An alternative mechanism, proposed recently, involves the PtSnO2 interface in the activation of carbon monoxide, as depicted in Scheme 2.
6. Using tin tetraalkyls such as Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4 yields Snanch/Pts ratios of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively.
7. By employing controlled surface reactions, alloy-type Sn-Pt nanoclusters can be synthesized, minimizing tin introduction into the support under optimized conditions.
8. Other research groups have adopted a similar approach for anchoring tin tetraalkyls onto various noble or transition metals using a one-step method.
9. Despite achieving high Snanch/Ms ratios, some studies introduce a definite amount of tin into the support when using high initial concentrations of tin tetraalkyls.
10. The objective of this study is to validate the effective use of Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and low-temperature CO oxidation, contingent upon the in-situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites on the surface of the alloy type SnPt nanoclusters.

1. 不饱和醛的氢化是一个重要的模型反应，通常涉及醛基和烯烃双键同时被氢化。
2. 含有锡、锗或铁等元素的改性铂催化剂在选择性氢化醛基方面表现出更高的选择性，与非改性催化剂相比。
3. 如图1所示，锡与铂之间的相互作用要求形成Snnn+Pt簇集结构，这些结构可以稳定在金属位点或金属-支持界面。
4. 在含二氧化锡的催化剂中，氧化物与金属相之间存在协同效应，如先前研究中所建议的。
5. 最近提出的一种替代机制涉及PtSnO2界面在碳氧化物激活中的作用，如图2所示。
6. 使用Sn(CH3)4、Sn(C2H5)4和Sn(C4H9)4等锡四烷基化合物可以获得的Snanch/Pts比分别为0.6、0.4和0.3。
7. 通过控制表面反应，可以在优化条件下合成合金型Sn-Pt纳米簇，最大限度地减少对支持的锡引入。
8. 其他研究小组采用了一种类似的方法，将锡四烷基单一步法锚定到各种贵金属或过渡金属上。
9. 尽管能够达到高Snanch/Ms比率，但在使用高初始浓度的锡四烷基化合物时，也会不可避免地向支持中引入一定量的锡。
10. 本研究的目的是验证Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂在选择性氢化α,β-不饱和醛和低温CO氧化中的有效应用，前提是能在合金型SnPt纳米簇表面上原位形成Sn4+Pt簇集结构。
