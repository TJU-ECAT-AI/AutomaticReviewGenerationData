1. "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3. Tin anchored this way appears in the form of a multilayer. In our earlier study it has also been shown that the formation of organotin layers on the platinum surface takes place layer by layer [17] . This study provides further proofs for this build-up process."
2. "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared. Details on the preparation of these catalysts and their test results will be summarized in this study."

1. The Sn anchoring process was modified to allow for a greater amount of tin to be anchored, resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3. The tin is anchored in a multilayer structure, and this process has been proven to form layers on the platinum surface in a sequential manner.

2. The previously discussed results strongly indicate that the alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively utilized in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and low temperature CO oxidation, provided that Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on the supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. To validate this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with various Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared. The details of the preparation of these catalysts and their testing results will be summarized in this study.

1. 通过修改锡锚定过程，允许更多的锡被锚定，从而产生了Snanch/Pts比接近3的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。锡以多层结构被锚定，并且已经证明该过程在铂表面形成层是分层次进行的。

2. 前面讨论的结果强烈表明，合金类型Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂可以有效地用于选择性氢化α，β-不饱和醛和低温CO氧化，前提是可以在支持的合金型SnPt纳米簇上形成Sn4+Pt团簇。为了验证这一假设，制备了具有不同Snanch/Pts比率的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。这些催化剂的准备细节及其测试结果将在本研究中总结。
