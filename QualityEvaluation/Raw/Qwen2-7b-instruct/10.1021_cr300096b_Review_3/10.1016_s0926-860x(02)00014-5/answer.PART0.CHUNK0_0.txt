The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnation techniques, which introduce tin into both the platinum and the support, leading to the formation of alloy type surface entities. However, the described study presents a new method for tin anchoring, which allows for the exclusive introduction of tin into the platinum, creating an alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalyst. This method results in high Snanch/Pts ratios, enabling the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites. These sites are crucial for the activation of carbonyl groups and carbon monoxide molecules, demonstrating the role of tin in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the catalysts.

In summary, traditional impregnation techniques may lead to the introduction of tin into both the platinum and the support, potentially hindering the formation of alloy type surface entities. The novel approach described in the study focuses on selectively anchoring tin onto the platinum surface, avoiding its introduction into the support. This results in catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios, capable of efficiently activating carbonyl groups and carbon monoxide, showcasing the effectiveness of tin in improving the performance of supported Sn-Pt catalysts.

在支持型双金属催化剂的合成中，通常使用浸渍技术，这种方法将锡引入铂和载体中，形成合金类型的表面实体。然而，本文中描述的研究提出了一种新的锡锚定方法，允许仅将锡引入到铂中，从而形成支持的Sn-Pt合金催化剂。这种方法能够实现较高的Snanch/Pts比率，从而促进Sn4+Pt复合体的原位形成。这些复合体对于激活羰基化合物和一氧化碳分子至关重要，证明了锡在增强催化剂活性和选择性方面的作用。

简而言之，传统的浸渍技术可能导致锡同时引入到铂和载体中，这可能阻碍合金类型表面实体的形成。而研究中描述的新方法专注于选择性地将锡锚定到铂表面，避免其进入载体。这种结果导致具有高Snanch/Pts比率的催化剂，能够有效地激活羰基化合物和一氧化碳，展示了锡在提高支持的Sn-Pt催化剂性能方面的有效性。
