[1] "Supported platinum catalysts modified by tin, germanium or iron have much higher selectivities for the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group than the unmodified one."
[2] "With respect to the form of promoters in modified platinum catalysts the role of ionic species has been emphasized."
[3] "It has also been suggested that in supported Sn-Pt catalysts the Snn+carbonyl interaction is responsible for the increased SCO selectivity."
[4] "In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared."
[5] "Upon using CSRs supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters can be obtained and under optimized conditions the introduction of tin into the support can almost completely be avoided."
[6] "In this approach, due to the use of high initial concentration of tin tetraalkyls, high Snanch/Ms ratios (M=Rh, Pt, etc.) were obtained, but a definite amount of tin was also introduced into the support."
[7] "Upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."
[8] "In Pt/SnO2 catalysts these sites can be found at the perimeter of the Pt nanocluster, while in the supported alloy type Sn-Pt catalysts these sites have to be formed in situ at the surface of the SnPt nanocluster."
[9] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include conventional impregnation techniques and controlled surface reactions (CSRs). Conventional impregnation techniques involve introducing tin into both the platinum and the support, leading to the formation of alloy-type surface entities. Controlled surface reactions allow for the formation of supported alloy type Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction, where tin is anchored to the platinum surface and can be introduced into the support under optimized conditions. The use of high initial concentrations of tin tetraalkyls in the synthesis process can lead to high Snanch/Ms ratios, but may also introduce tin into the support. The effectiveness of these methods lies in their ability to tailor the activity and selectivity of the catalysts by controlling the interaction between tin and the support or the metal.

常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法包括常规浸渍技术和控制表面反应（CSR）。常规浸渍技术通过将锡引入铂和载体中，形成合金型表面实体。控制表面反应允许形成具有纯锡-铂相互作用的合金型Sn-Pt催化剂，其中锡被锚定到铂表面上，并在优化条件下可以引入到支持物中。使用高初始浓度的锡四烷基化合物在合成过程中可以导致高的Snanch/Ms比率，但可能会将锡引入到支持物中。这些方法的有效性在于它们能够通过控制锡与支持物或金属之间的相互作用来调整催化剂的活性和选择性。
