The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnation techniques, which introduce tin into both the platinum and the support, leading to the formation of alloy type surface entities. However, the described study presents a new method for tin anchoring, which allows for the exclusive introduction of tin into the platinum, creating an alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalyst. This method results in high Snanch/Pts ratios, enabling the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites. These sites are crucial for the activation of carbonyl groups and carbon monoxide molecules, demonstrating the role of tin in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the catalysts.

In summary, traditional impregnation techniques may lead to the introduction of tin into both the platinum and the support, potentially hindering the formation of alloy type surface entities. The novel approach described in the study focuses on selectively anchoring tin onto the platinum surface, avoiding its introduction into the support. This results in catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios, capable of efficiently activating carbonyl groups and carbon monoxide, showcasing the effectiveness of tin in improving the performance of supported Sn-Pt catalysts.

在支持型双金属催化剂的合成中，通常使用浸渍技术，这种方法将锡引入铂和载体中，形成合金类型的表面实体。然而，本文中描述的研究提出了一种新的锡锚定方法，允许仅将锡引入到铂中，从而形成支持的Sn-Pt合金催化剂。这种方法能够实现较高的Snanch/Pts比率，从而促进Sn4+Pt复合体的原位形成。这些复合体对于激活羰基化合物和一氧化碳分子至关重要，证明了锡在增强催化剂活性和选择性方面的作用。

简而言之，传统的浸渍技术可能导致锡同时引入到铂和载体中，这可能阻碍合金类型表面实体的形成。而研究中描述的新方法专注于选择性地将锡锚定到铂表面，避免其进入载体。这种结果导致具有高Snanch/Pts比率的催化剂，能够有效地激活羰基化合物和一氧化碳，展示了锡在提高支持的Sn-Pt催化剂性能方面的有效性。

1. "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3. Tin anchored this way appears in the form of a multilayer. In our earlier study it has also been shown that the formation of organotin layers on the platinum surface takes place layer by layer [17] . This study provides further proofs for this build-up process."
2. "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared. Details on the preparation of these catalysts and their test results will be summarized in this study."

1. The Sn anchoring process was modified to allow for a greater amount of tin to be anchored, resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3. The tin is anchored in a multilayer structure, and this process has been proven to form layers on the platinum surface in a sequential manner.

2. The previously discussed results strongly indicate that the alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively utilized in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and low temperature CO oxidation, provided that Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on the supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. To validate this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with various Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared. The details of the preparation of these catalysts and their testing results will be summarized in this study.

1. 通过修改锡锚定过程，允许更多的锡被锚定，从而产生了Snanch/Pts比接近3的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。锡以多层结构被锚定，并且已经证明该过程在铂表面形成层是分层次进行的。

2. 前面讨论的结果强烈表明，合金类型Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂可以有效地用于选择性氢化α，β-不饱和醛和低温CO氧化，前提是可以在支持的合金型SnPt纳米簇上形成Sn4+Pt团簇。为了验证这一假设，制备了具有不同Snanch/Pts比率的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。这些催化剂的准备细节及其测试结果将在本研究中总结。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include conventional impregnation techniques and controlled surface reactions (CSRs). Conventional impregnation techniques involve introducing tin into both the platinum and the support, leading to the formation of alloy-type surface entities. Controlled surface reactions allow for the formation of supported alloy type Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction, where tin is anchored to the platinum surface and can be introduced into the support under optimized conditions. The use of high initial concentrations of tin tetraalkyls in the synthesis process can lead to high Snanch/Ms ratios, but may also introduce tin into the support. The effectiveness of these methods lies in their ability to tailor the activity and selectivity of the catalysts by controlling the interaction between tin and the support or the metal.

常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法包括常规浸渍技术和控制表面反应（CSR）。常规浸渍技术通过将锡引入铂和载体中，形成合金型表面实体。控制表面反应允许形成具有纯锡-铂相互作用的合金型Sn-Pt催化剂，其中锡被锚定到铂表面上，并在优化条件下可以引入到支持物中。使用高初始浓度的锡四烷基化合物在合成过程中可以导致高的Snanch/Ms比率，但可能会将锡引入到支持物中。这些方法的有效性在于它们能够通过控制锡与支持物或金属之间的相互作用来调整催化剂的活性和选择性。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnation techniques. However, these methods often lead to the introduction of tin into both the platinum and the support, making it difficult to control the formation of alloy type surface entities. The introduction of tin into the support is also not easily avoided. To address these issues, controlled surface reactions (CSRs) were developed. These reactions allow for the effective anchoring of tin onto the platinum surface, resulting in the formation of supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. This method enables the introduction of tin into the catalyst without affecting the support, thus avoiding the incorporation of tin into the support. By using tin tetraalkyls in excess hydrogen, all of the tin introduced can be anchored onto the platinum surface. This leads to a significant increase in the Snanch/Pts ratio, surpassing the monolayer coverage under optimized conditions. The efficiency of tin anchoring is greatly improved by controlling the tin precursor concentration, reaction time, temperature, and the use of excess hydrogen and oxygen.

支持双金属催化剂的最常见合成方法涉及浸渍技术。然而，这些方法往往会导致铂和载体中都引入锡，这使得控制表面实体的形成变得困难。将锡引入载体也不容易避免。为了解决这些问题，开发了受控表面反应（CSR）。这些反应允许有效地将锡锚定到铂表面上，从而形成支持的合金型SnPt纳米簇。这种方法使在催化剂中引入锡而不影响载体成为可能，从而避免将锡引入载体。通过使用过量的锡四烷基化合物，在氢气气氛下，可以将所有引入的锡锚定到铂表面上。这导致Snanch/Pts比显著超过单层覆盖，在优化条件下。在合适的实验条件下，锡锚定效率得到极大提高，通过控制锡前体浓度、反应时间、温度以及使用过量氢气和氧气。
