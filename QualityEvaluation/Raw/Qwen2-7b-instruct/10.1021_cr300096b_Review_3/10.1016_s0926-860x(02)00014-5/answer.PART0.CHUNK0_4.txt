[1] "In this paper general aspects of catalyst design based on the use of tin tetraalkyls are described in detail."
[2] "In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."
[3] "Upon using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4 the following Snanch/Pts ratios were obtained: 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively."
[4] "Upon using CSRs supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters can be obtained and under optimized conditions the introduction of tin into the support can almost completely be avoided."
[5] "Results of tin anchoring obtained (i) in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen, (ii) in excess hydrogen, and (iii) in the presence of small amount of oxygen strongly indicate (see Table 3 ) that under favorable experimental conditions the Snanch/Pts ratio strongly exceeds the monolayer coverage."
[6] "These results also show that upon using Sn(CH3)4 in excess hydrogen all amount of tin introduced has been anchored."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnation techniques. However, these methods often lead to the introduction of tin into both the platinum and the support, making it difficult to control the formation of alloy type surface entities. The introduction of tin into the support is also not easily avoided. To address these issues, controlled surface reactions (CSRs) were developed. These reactions allow for the effective anchoring of tin onto the platinum surface, resulting in the formation of supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters. This method enables the introduction of tin into the catalyst without affecting the support, thus avoiding the incorporation of tin into the support. By using tin tetraalkyls in excess hydrogen, all of the tin introduced can be anchored onto the platinum surface. This leads to a significant increase in the Snanch/Pts ratio, surpassing the monolayer coverage under optimized conditions. The efficiency of tin anchoring is greatly improved by controlling the tin precursor concentration, reaction time, temperature, and the use of excess hydrogen and oxygen.

支持双金属催化剂的最常见合成方法涉及浸渍技术。然而，这些方法往往会导致铂和载体中都引入锡，这使得控制表面实体的形成变得困难。将锡引入载体也不容易避免。为了解决这些问题，开发了受控表面反应（CSR）。这些反应允许有效地将锡锚定到铂表面上，从而形成支持的合金型SnPt纳米簇。这种方法使在催化剂中引入锡而不影响载体成为可能，从而避免将锡引入载体。通过使用过量的锡四烷基化合物，在氢气气氛下，可以将所有引入的锡锚定到铂表面上。这导致Snanch/Pts比显著超过单层覆盖，在优化条件下。在合适的实验条件下，锡锚定效率得到极大提高，通过控制锡前体浓度、反应时间、温度以及使用过量氢气和氧气。
