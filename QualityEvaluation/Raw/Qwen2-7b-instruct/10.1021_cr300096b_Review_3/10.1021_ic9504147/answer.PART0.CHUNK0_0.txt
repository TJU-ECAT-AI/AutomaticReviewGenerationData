[1] "Supported molecular metal complexes and organometallic compounds have been extensively studied as novel catalysts and metal particle catalyst precursors."
[2] "The field of surface organometallic chemistry deals with this topic and has recently received significant attention."
[3] "There have been very few studies of this type with cationic, phosphine-ligated compounds, and we are unaware of any with this class of cluster compounds."
[4] "All samples subjected to the thermolysis conditions given above were found to be intact by 31P MAS NMR and could be quantitatively desorbed."
[5] "The high activities of the supported PtAu clusters are believed to result from support-promoted, partial PPh3 dissociation."
[6] "The mechanism with the monohydrido cluster 3 also involves PPh3 dissociation followed by the addition of D2 to give a tri(hydrido,deuterido) species or activated complex."

1. Supported molecular metal complexes and organometallic compounds have been widely explored as innovative catalysts and precursors for metal particle catalysts.
2. Surface organometallic chemistry is an area of focus that has gained considerable interest recently.
3. To date, there have been few investigations involving cationic, phosphine-ligated compounds, particularly with regard to this specific class of cluster compounds.
4. Upon undergoing the specified thermolysis conditions, all samples were found to remain intact, as evidenced by 31P MAS NMR analysis, and could be quantitatively desorbed.
5. The enhanced activity of the supported PtAu clusters is hypothesized to stem from the promotion of partial dissociation of a PPh3 ligand by the rigid support material.
6. For cluster 3, the mechanism includes PPh3 dissociation, followed by the incorporation of D2, leading to the formation of a tri(hydrido,deuterido) species or an activated complex.
