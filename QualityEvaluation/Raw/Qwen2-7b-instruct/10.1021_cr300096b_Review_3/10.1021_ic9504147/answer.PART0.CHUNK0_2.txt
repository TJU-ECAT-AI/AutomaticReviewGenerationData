The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve depositing metal complexes or compounds onto a support material. These methods often include impregnation, precipitation, and co-precipitation techniques. Impregnation involves soaking the support in a solution containing the metal precursor, allowing the metal to be absorbed onto the support's surface or within its pores. Precipitation involves adding a metal salt solution to a precipitant solution, which causes the metal to form as a solid on the support. Co-precipitation combines these methods, allowing the metal to form with other components simultaneously. These methods compare in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy based on factors such as catalyst activity, stability, and cost. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst and the desired properties of the final product.

最常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法包括将金属前体溶液浸渍到支撑材料上，使金属吸附到支撑表面或进入其孔隙中。沉淀法是通过向沉淀剂溶液中加入金属盐溶液，使金属在支撑物上形成固体。共沉淀结合了这两种方法，同时允许金属与其他成分一起形成。这些方法在潜在优势、应用和总体效率方面的比较取决于因素如催化剂活性、稳定性及成本。选择方法取决于催化剂的具体需求和最终产品的预期属性。
