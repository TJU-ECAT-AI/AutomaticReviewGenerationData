[2] "The field of surface organometallic chemistry deals with this topic and has recently received significant attention."
[3] "Studies in this field have primarily used transition metal carbonyl cluster compounds deposited on a variety of metal oxide supports."
[4] "Although supported molecular compounds are not likely to be practical catalysts themselves due to their instability, the study of their surface chemistry can provide useful insight into cluster reactivity and the mechanism of thermal activation."
[5] "There have been very few studies of this type with cationic, phosphine-ligated compounds,2 and we are unaware of any with this class of cluster compounds."
[6] "These clusters are very well characterized in solid (single-crystal X-ray diffraction) and solution (NMR, IR, UVvisible spectroscopy) phases."
[7] "All samples subjected to the thermolysis conditions given above were found to be intact by 31P MAS NMR and could be quantitatively desorbed."
[8] "The high activities of the supported PtAu clusters are believed to result from support-promoted, partial PPh3 dissociation."
[9] "The mechanism with the monohydrido cluster 3 also involves PPh3 dissociation followed by the addition of D2 to give a tri(hydrido,deuterido) species or activated complex."
[10] "The rate of heterogeneous H2D2 equilibration with microcrystalline samples of 13 was faster than that in homogeneous solution (TOR = 25 s-1, 1 atm, 30 C),"
[11] "The clusters, treated as described above, could be desorbed from alumina by washing with CH3OH solvent. Complete desorption from silica required washing with CH3OH saturated with KPF6."
[12] "The rate of ethylene hydrogenation was also determined for 1 supported on SiO2 and Al2O3."
[13] "Samples of 3/SiO2 were evacuated at RT until the same pressure was achieved (34 h)."
[14] "The UVvisible spectra of the SiO2-supported clusters were recorded as CH2Cl2 gel/suspensions and compared with their solution spectra."
[15] "Samples dried in air for about 10 min after removal of the CH2Cl2 solvent gave good resolution, enabling accurate determination of the chemical shifts (δ) and coupling constants."
[16] "The rate of heterogeneous H2D2 equilibration was determined for the supported clusters with use of a flow reactor."
[17] "The results are reported in Table 1. The rates are independent of support particle size (4060 to 80100 mesh), indicating that they are not limited by gas diffusion."
[18] "The TOR's for 1 and 2 did not depend significantly on the support but were reproducible only after pretreatment at 135 C under high vacuum."
[19] "The gold cluster [Au(AuPPh3)8](NO3)3 was supported on SiO2 as a control and pretreated at RT under high vacuum."
[20] "The TOR's for these clusters on SiO2 significantly increased (by a factor of 20 for 1/SiO2) after heating at 110 C under H2, although 31P MAS NMR showed no significant changes and desorption indicated no irreversible transformations."
[21] "The fact that 3/SiO2 is highly active (TOR = 170 s-1) without thermolysis under H2 is also consistent with a PPh3 dissociation mechanism."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve depositing transition metal carbonyl cluster compounds onto metal oxide supports. These methods are effective in providing insight into cluster reactivity and thermal activation mechanisms.

2. The high activities of the supported PtAu clusters result from support-promoted, partial PPh3 dissociation, leading to species with a bare Au atom that can effectively bind incoming substrates without forming large intermediates.

3. The mechanism for ethylene hydrogenation involving the supported PtAu clusters involves PPh3 dissociation, followed by the addition of D2 to form a tri(hydrido,deuterido) species or an activated complex.

4. The rate of heterogeneous H2D2 equilibration with microcrystalline samples of the clusters was faster than in homogeneous solution, indicating enhanced reactivity on the surface.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve depositing metal complexes or compounds onto a support material. These methods often include impregnation, precipitation, and co-precipitation techniques. Impregnation involves soaking the support in a solution containing the metal precursor, allowing the metal to be absorbed onto the support's surface or within its pores. Precipitation involves adding a metal salt solution to a precipitant solution, which causes the metal to form as a solid on the support. Co-precipitation combines these methods, allowing the metal to form with other components simultaneously. These methods compare in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy based on factors such as catalyst activity, stability, and cost. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst and the desired properties of the final product.
