2.1 "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
2.2 "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen."
2.3 "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR). Among these, ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple but tend to produce catalysts with lower activity compared to those synthesized through more sophisticated techniques like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced metallic catalyst and depositing promoters through the reduction of precursor compounds by the adsorbed hydrogen. A recent development, MAPR, utilizes microwave irradiation to uniformly heat metal precursors, resulting in shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation, thus offering catalysts with superior catalytic properties.

常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）、还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）。其中，离子交换和浸渍方法简单，但合成的催化剂活性通常低于通过更复杂的HDP和RDP技术合成的催化剂。RDP方法涉及在预还原的金属催化剂上吸附氢气，并通过吸附的氢气还原前体化合物来沉积促进剂。最近提出的一种新方法，即MAPR技术，利用微波辐射均匀加热金属前体，从而缩短结晶时间并实现更均匀的核化，因此提供具有优越催化性能的催化剂。
