[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
[3] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen."
[4] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells."
[5] "It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metal-metal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR). Among these methods, ion-exchange and impregnation are considered simpler, but they often yield catalysts with lower activity compared to those synthesized through more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced metallic catalyst before depositing promoters through the reduction of precursor precursors. The MAPR technique, recently proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells, retains the hydrophobic surface properties of the carbon nanotube (CNT) support and facilitates close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, enhancing the catalytic performance of the Pt active sites. This close contact is due to a metal-metal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic properties.

常用的合成支持双金属催化剂的方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）、还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）。在这些方法中，离子交换和浸渍被认为是更简单的，但它们经常产生活性较低的催化剂与通过更复杂的方法如HDP和RDP合成的催化剂相比。RDP方法涉及在预还原的金属催化剂上吸附氢气，然后通过吸附的氢气将前体前体还原以沉积促进剂。最近提出的MAPR技术用于合成Pt基电催化剂以用于燃料电池，它保留了碳纳米管（CNT）支持的疏水表面特性，并促进了促进剂和Pt纳米颗粒之间的紧密接触，显著提高了Pt活性位点的催化性能。这种紧密接触归因于金属-金属电子相互作用，这极大地改善了催化性质。
