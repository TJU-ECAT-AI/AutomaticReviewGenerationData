[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
[2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen."
[3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells."
[4] "It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metal-metal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR). Among these, ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple but typically yield less active catalysts compared to more sophisticated techniques like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters through the reduction of precursor compounds by the adsorbed hydrogen. Recently, the MAPR technique has been proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells, offering an advantage over traditional methods by preserving hydrophobic surface properties of the support material and enabling closer contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of the active sites.

常用的制备负载型双金属催化剂的方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）、还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）。其中，离子交换和浸渍方法简单，但通常产生的催化剂活性较低，相比之下，更先进的技术如HDP和RDP则表现更好。在RDP方法中，氢气被预先还原的母金属催化剂吸附，随后通过吸附的氢气还原前体化合物来沉积促进剂。最近，提出了MAPR技术用于合成燃料电池用的Pt基电催化剂，该方法的优势在于保留了支撑材料的疏水表面特性，并使促进剂与Pt纳米粒子之间的接触更为紧密，从而显著提高了活性位点的催化性能。
