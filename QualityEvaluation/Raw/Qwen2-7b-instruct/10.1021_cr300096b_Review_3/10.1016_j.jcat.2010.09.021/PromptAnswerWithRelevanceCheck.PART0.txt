[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
[2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen."
[3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells."
[4] "It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metal-metal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites."
[5] "Interestingly, other than generally adopted solvents such as alcohols and alkanes, the as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). Among these, the IMP method is simpler but typically yields catalysts with lower activity compared to those produced by more advanced techniques like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters through the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. A recent innovative method, the microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) technique, has been introduced for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells. This method retains the hydrophobic surface properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and facilitates close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, enhancing the catalytic performance of Pt active sites. Additionally, the use of ethyl acetate (EA) as a solvent in the MAPR process resulted in remarkable improvements in activity and selectivity compared to traditionally used solvents like alcohols and alkanes.

1. 最常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）和还原沉淀（RDP）。其中，IMP方法虽然简单，但合成的催化剂活性通常低于采用更高级技术如HDP和RDP方法制备的催化剂。RDP方法涉及在预还原的母金属催化剂上吸附氢气，然后通过吸附氢气还原前体促进剂来沉积促进剂。最近提出了一种新的制备方法，即微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）技术，用于合成用于燃料电池的Pt基电催化剂。该方法保留了碳纳米管（CNT）的疏水表面特性，并且促进了促进剂与Pt纳米颗粒之间的紧密接触，显著提高了Pt活性位点的催化性能。此外，在MAPR过程中使用乙酸乙酯（EA）作为溶剂，与传统使用的醇类和烷烃等溶剂相比，实现了显著的活性和选择性提升。

Among these methods, ion-exchange and impregnation are considered simpler, but they often yield catalysts with lower activity compared to those synthesized through more sophisticated approaches like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced metallic catalyst before depositing promoters through the reduction of precursor precursors. The MAPR technique, recently proposed for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells, retains the hydrophobic surface properties of the carbon nanotube (CNT) support and facilitates close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, enhancing the catalytic performance of the Pt active sites. This close contact is due to a metal-metal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic properties.

2. Compared to the conventional impregnation method, the MAPR method yields catalysts with higher activity and selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. This is attributed to the method's ability to retain the hydrophobic surface properties of carbon nanotubes and facilitate close contact between platinum active sites and promoters, enhancing catalytic performance.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR). Among these, ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple but tend to produce catalysts with lower activity compared to those synthesized through more sophisticated techniques like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced metallic catalyst and depositing promoters through the reduction of precursor compounds by the adsorbed hydrogen.
