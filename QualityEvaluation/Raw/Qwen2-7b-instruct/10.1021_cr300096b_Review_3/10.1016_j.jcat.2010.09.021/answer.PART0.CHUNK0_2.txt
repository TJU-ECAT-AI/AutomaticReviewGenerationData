[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
[3] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen."
[4] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells."
[5] "In this contribution, we apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR). Among these, ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple but typically yield catalysts with lower activity compared to those produced through more advanced techniques like HDP and RDP. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on the pre-reduced metallic catalyst and depositing promoters by reducing precursor precursors with the adsorbed hydrogen. Recently, the MAPR technique has emerged as a novel method for synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells, offering advantages over conventional methods.
2. Compared to the conventional impregnation method, the MAPR method yields catalysts with higher activity and selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. This is attributed to the method's ability to retain the hydrophobic surface properties of carbon nanotubes and facilitate close contact between platinum active sites and promoters, enhancing catalytic performance.

1. 常用的制备支持双金属催化剂的方法包括离子交换、浸渍（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀（HDP）、还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）。其中，离子交换和浸渍方法虽然简单，但合成的催化剂活性通常低于通过更高级的技术如HDP和RDP制备的催化剂。在RDP方法中，氢吸附在预还原的金属催化剂上，随后通过吸附氢还原前体化合物来沉积促进剂。最近，为燃料电池开发了一种新型的制备方法，即微波辅助聚醇还原（MAPR）技术，用于合成铂基电催化剂。与传统方法相比，MAPR方法能够制备出具有更高活性和选择性的cinnamaldehyde氢化催化剂。
2. 相比于传统的浸渍方法，使用MAPR方法制备的催化剂在cinnamaldehyde氢化反应中的活性和选择性更高。这归因于该方法能够保留碳纳米管的疏水表面特性，并促进铂活性位点与促进剂之间的紧密接触，从而提高催化性能。
