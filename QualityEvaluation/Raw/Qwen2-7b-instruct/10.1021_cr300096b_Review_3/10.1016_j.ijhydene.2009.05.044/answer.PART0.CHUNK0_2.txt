The literature discusses various synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts, including precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. The incipient wetness impregnation method is most frequently used. This method allows for precise control over the metal loading and particle size. However, the literature highlights that the use of organometallic cluster precursors offers advantages such as better control over bimetallic composition and smaller particle sizes.
