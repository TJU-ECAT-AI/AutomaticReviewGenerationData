<quotes>
[1] "The cluster-derived catalysts were found to be more active and selective than a commercial catalyst as well as their salt-derived counterparts."
[2] "The cluster-derived catalysts were found to be significantly more active than all Ru-based salt-derived catalysts, Ru(5)[com] and Co(2.5)."
[3] "In the previous report, the two cluster-derived catalysts were prepared from the cluster anions [HRu3(CO)11] and [Ru5PtC(CO)15]2 [11]."
[4] "The improved ethanol steam reforming efficiencies of the cluster-derived catalysts over the others become more evident when the hydrogen yields YH2 are calculated."
[5] "In the presence of excess steam, the reaction produces a theoretical maximum of six moles of H2 for each mole of injected ethanol."
[6] "The cluster-derived catalysts were found to be significantly more active and selective than the Ru, RuPt salt-derived and commercial catalysts, as well as the Co/ZnO catalyst."
[7] "With the use of cluster precursors, excellent control of bimetallic composition and smaller particle sizes were achieved."
[8] "The high catalytic efficiencies of the cluster-derived catalysts are attributed to the very small sizes of the metallic nanoparticles."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. These methods vary in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. For instance, precipitation is straightforward but may not offer precise control over particle size and composition. Deposition-precipitation and co-precipitation allow for better control of particle size and composition, but they can be complex processes. Sol-gel methods provide good control over morphology and structure, while sonochemical methods can enhance the dispersion of metal nanoparticles. Incipient wetness impregnation is favored for its simplicity and ease of scale-up, but it may not always lead to uniform particle sizes and compositions. Among these, incipient wetness impregnation is the most frequently used method for preparing supported bimetallic catalysts. However, the choice of synthesis method ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst, such as desired particle size, morphology, and composition.

常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法包括沉淀法、沉积沉淀法、共沉淀法、溶胶凝胶法、超声化学法和浸渍法。这些方法在优势、应用范围和整体生产效率方面有所不同。例如，沉淀法操作简便，但可能无法精确控制颗粒大小和组成。沉积沉淀法和共沉淀法则能提供更好的颗粒大小和组成的控制，但过程可能较为复杂。溶胶凝胶法能很好地控制形态和结构，而超声化学法则能增强金属纳米颗粒的分散性。浸渍法因其简单性和易于放大生产而受到青睐，但这种方法可能不一定能始终实现均匀的颗粒大小和组成。然而，选择合成方法最终取决于催化剂的具体需求，如所需颗粒大小、形态和组成等。

Answer: The cluster-derived catalysts outperformed all others in terms of activity and selectivity for ethanol steam reforming. Specifically, the cluster-derived catalysts showed higher ethanol conversion and hydrogen yield compared to commercial catalysts, salt-derived catalysts, and even the Rh catalyst. The bimetallic Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] catalyst, derived from the neutral cluster Ru3(CO)12, exhibited particularly high efficiency, especially at lower temperatures. The presence of platinum in the cluster-derived catalyst helped promote the water gas shift reaction at low temperatures and facilitated the cleavage of the ethanol CC bond. The cluster decarbonylation method proved advantageous in achieving better control of bimetallic composition and smaller particle sizes, making it a promising approach for designing efficient ethanol steam reforming catalysts.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. Among these, incipient wetness impregnation is the most frequently used method. These methods vary in their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Incipient wetness impregnation allows for the precise control of metal loading and particle size, making it suitable for creating catalysts with specific properties. Precipitation methods are versatile and can be adapted for various metal combinations, whereas deposition-precipitation and co-precipitation are useful for creating homogeneous catalysts. Sol-gel processes offer the ability to form porous structures and can lead to the creation of catalysts with tailored porosity. Sonochemical methods involve ultrasonic waves to enhance the synthesis process, leading to the formation of nanoparticles. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on the desired catalyst characteristics and the specific application.
