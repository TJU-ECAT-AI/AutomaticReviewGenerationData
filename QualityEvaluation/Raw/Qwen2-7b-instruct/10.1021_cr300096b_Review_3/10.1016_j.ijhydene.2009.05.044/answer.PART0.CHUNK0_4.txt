"Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date have involved either inorganic oxides[16,17] or oxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipi- tation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently,incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."
