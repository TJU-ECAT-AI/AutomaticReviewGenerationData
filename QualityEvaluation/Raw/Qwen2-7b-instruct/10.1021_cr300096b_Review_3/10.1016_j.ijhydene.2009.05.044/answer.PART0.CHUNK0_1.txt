[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date have involved either inorganic oxides[16,17] or oxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts."
[2] "Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipi- tation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently,incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation. Among these, incipient wetness impregnation is the most frequently used method. These methods vary in their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Incipient wetness impregnation allows for the precise control of metal loading and particle size, making it suitable for creating catalysts with specific properties. Precipitation methods are versatile and can be adapted for various metal combinations, whereas deposition-precipitation and co-precipitation are useful for creating homogeneous catalysts. Sol-gel processes offer the ability to form porous structures and can lead to the creation of catalysts with tailored porosity. Sonochemical methods involve ultrasonic waves to enhance the synthesis process, leading to the formation of nanoparticles. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on the desired catalyst characteristics and the specific application.

到目前为止，大多数乙醇蒸汽重整研究涉及无机氧化物[16,17]或氧化物支持金属[2331]作为催化剂。文献中报道的催化剂制备方法包括沉淀[29,30]、沉积沉淀[23]、共沉淀[30]、溶胶凝胶[31]、声化学[32]，以及最常用的浸渍法[2427]。这些方法在潜在优势、应用和整体效能方面有所不同。浸渍法允许精确控制金属负载和颗粒大小，因此适合制造具有特定性质的催化剂。沉淀法具有灵活性，适用于各种金属组合，而沉积沉淀和共沉淀方法则适用于创建均相催化剂。溶胶凝胶过程能够形成多孔结构，并可能导致催化剂具有定制的孔隙率。声化学方法利用超声波增强合成过程，导致纳米粒子的形成。每种方法都有其强项和弱点，这取决于所需催化剂特性和具体应用。
