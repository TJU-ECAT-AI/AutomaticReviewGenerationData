[1] "Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation."
[2] "This synthesis method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles."
[3] "For example, Lonergan et al. have shown that PtNi catalysts synthesized by simultaneous impregnation were more active for 1,3-butadiene and benzene hydrogenation than catalysts synthesized using sequential impregnation."
[4] "This synthesis process is that the catalyst is formed directly on the walls of the reactor, allowing for high loading and potentially uniform catalyst deposition."
[5] "In the laser-vaporization technique, a low-energy Nd:YAG pulsed laser vaporizes a metal of interest from a rod to create a plasma."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the wet impregnation method, slurry synthesis method, organometallic cluster precursors, reductive deposition precipitation, electroless deposition, colloidal synthesis, core-shell synthesis, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer support synthesis, microwave-assisted polyol reduction, direct deposition on the reactor wall, and laser vaporization. Each method offers unique advantages and applications in catalyst production. Wet impregnation is favored for its ease in sample preparation. The slurry synthesis method is suitable for catalysts with high metal loadings and low surface areas. Organometallic cluster precursors allow for the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles. Reductive deposition precipitation provides highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts. Electroless deposition enables targeted placement of the second metal on the surface of a preexisting monometallic catalyst. Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over the size and composition of bimetallic particles. Core-shell synthesis creates catalysts with a transition metal core and a precious metal shell. Reverse micelle synthesis produces supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm. Microwave-assisted polyol reduction allows for rapid uniform heating of metal precursors. Direct deposition on the reactor wall forms the catalyst directly on the walls, enabling high loading and potentially uniform deposition. Laser vaporization synthesizes monometallic and bimetallic catalysts with uniform size, shape, and composition.

The wet impregnation method is particularly advantageous due to its simplicity and ease of sample preparation. The slurry synthesis method is ideal for catalysts requiring high metal loadings and supports with low surface areas. Organometallic cluster precursors provide a means to achieve higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation is an alternative to organometallic precursor methods, avoiding premature decomposition. Electroless deposition results in targeted placement of the second metal on the surface of a preexisting catalyst. Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over the size and composition of bimetallic particles. Core-shell synthesis creates catalysts with a low-cost transition metal core and a precious metal shell. Reverse micelle synthesis enables the direct control of the size of metallic nanoparticles. Dendrimer support synthesis produces monodisperse particles with a diameter of 12 nm. Microwave-assisted polyol reduction accelerates the synthesis process, leading to more homogeneous nucleation. Direct deposition on the reactor wall forms the catalyst directly on the walls of the reactor, facilitating high loading and potentially uniform deposition. Laser vaporization synthesizes catalysts with uniform size, shape, and composition, offering the opportunity for fundamental correlations between catalytic properties and the size, shape, and composition of bimetallic catalysts.
