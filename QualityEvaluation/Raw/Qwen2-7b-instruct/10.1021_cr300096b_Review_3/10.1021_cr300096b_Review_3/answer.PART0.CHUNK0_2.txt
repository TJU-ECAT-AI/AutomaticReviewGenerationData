[1] "Wet Impregnation Method Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation."
[2] "This synthesis method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles."
[3] "For coreshell systems, it is also desirable to synthesize catalysts with a low-cost transition metal core and Pt or other precious metals at the outermost layer."
[4] "Reverse micelle synthesis is a useful technique because the size of the metallic nanoparticles can be directly controlled by the ratio of water to surfactant."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include wet impregnation, slurry synthesis, organometallic cluster precursors, reductive deposition precipitation, electroless deposition, colloidal synthesis, core-shell synthesis, reverse micelle synthesis, and dendrimer support synthesis. Wet impregnation offers ease in sample preparation, while slurry synthesis is useful for high metal loadings and supports with low surface areas. Organometallic cluster precursors provide more uniform bimetallic catalysts. Reductive deposition precipitation converts monometallic catalysts into bimetallic ones, and electroless deposition selectively deposits metal onto the surface. Colloidal synthesis allows for precise control over particle size and composition. Core-shell synthesis creates catalysts with a low-cost core and precious metal shell. Reverse micelle synthesis enables direct control over particle size via the ratio of water to surfactant. Lastly, dendrimer support synthesis produces monodisperse particles with controlled size.
