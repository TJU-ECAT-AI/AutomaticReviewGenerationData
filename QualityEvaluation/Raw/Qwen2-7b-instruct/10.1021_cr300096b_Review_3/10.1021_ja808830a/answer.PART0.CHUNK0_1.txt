[1] "The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include physical co-precipitation, solvothermal synthesis, and electrodeposition."
[2] "Physical co-precipitation involves mixing two metal salts in an aqueous solution, followed by precipitation and washing to obtain the desired catalyst."
[3] "Solvothermal synthesis requires the use of high-temperature and high-pressure conditions under an inert atmosphere, where the reactants are dissolved in a solvent."
[4] "Electrodeposition is a process where metals are deposited on a substrate through an electrochemical reaction."
[5] "The comparison of these methods reveals that physical co-precipitation is simple and versatile, solvothermal synthesis provides better control over the particle size and morphology, while electrodeposition allows for precise control over the composition and structure of the catalyst."
