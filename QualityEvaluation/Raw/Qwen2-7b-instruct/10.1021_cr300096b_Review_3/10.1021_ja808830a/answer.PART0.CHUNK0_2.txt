The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include co-precipitation, impregnation, and electrodeposition. Co-precipitation is advantageous for its simplicity in controlling particle composition and size. Impregnation allows for precise metal loading onto the support, enhancing stability and activity. Electrodeposition offers the highest control over morphology and composition but demands more complex experimental setups. The efficacy of these methods varies based on factors such as catalyst properties, production scale, and reaction conditions.
