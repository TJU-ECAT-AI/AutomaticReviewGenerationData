The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include coprecipitation, impregnation, solvothermal synthesis, and microemulsion techniques. These methods have distinct advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the catalyst. Coprecipitation is advantageous for its simplicity and control over particle characteristics, while impregnation offers flexibility in support materials and precise control over metal loading. Solvothermal synthesis produces highly crystalline and uniform particles, suitable for catalysts requiring high stability and activity. Microemulsion techniques enable the creation of well-dispersed particles with narrow size distributions, enhancing catalyst efficiency and selectivity. The overall efficacy of these methods depends on factors such as the desired particle size, shape, and crystallinity, and the choice of synthesis method also impacts cost-effectiveness and scalability.
