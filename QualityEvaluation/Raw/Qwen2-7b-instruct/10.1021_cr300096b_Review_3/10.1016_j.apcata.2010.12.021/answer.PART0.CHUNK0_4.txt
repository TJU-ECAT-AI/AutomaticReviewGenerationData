1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer encapsulation, and self-assembly of diblock co-polymers into micelles. These methods vary in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Incipient wetness impregnation is a traditional approach, but it may struggle to maintain narrow particle size distributions. Reverse micelle synthesis offers a way to control nanoparticle size, dendrimer encapsulation can encapsulate catalysts, and self-assembly allows for precise control over nanoparticle size and shape.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation typically involves dissolving the metal salt in water equivalent to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. This method is straightforward but may not always result in uniform particle sizes due to challenges in controlling the size distribution.

3. The literature discusses the challenges associated with maintaining narrow particle size distributions when using incipient wetness impregnation, indicating that achieving uniformity can be difficult.

4. The Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface is a well-studied model bimetallic system that exhibits enhanced activity for hydrogenation reactions, particularly at low temperatures.

5. Recent studies have extended the enhanced hydrogenation activity observed on the Pt-terminated bimetallic model surfaces to oxide-supported Pt/Ni catalysts synthesized through incipient wetness impregnation, demonstrating the potential of this method for improving catalyst performance.

6. The reverse micelle synthesis process was adapted from previous work to synthesize uniform, reduced Ni nanoparticles, which were then supported on γ-Al2O3 and deposited with Pt using incipient wetness impregnation.

7. The Pt precursor was measured to ensure a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, corresponding to a 1.67% weight loading of Pt on the catalyst.

8. High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images revealed that the nanoparticles had a small size (approximately 2 nm) and maintained uniformity before and after high-temperature cleaning treatments.

9. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) confirmed that the majority of Ni was adsorbed onto the support, while the amount of Pt deposition during reverse micelle synthesis was limited.

10. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements confirmed the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds in the step-impregnated catalyst, which contributed to the enhanced activity for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation.

11. The synthesis and characterization results collectively demonstrated the viability of using reverse micelle synthesis to create supported bimetallic catalysts with narrow particle size distributions and improved catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions.
