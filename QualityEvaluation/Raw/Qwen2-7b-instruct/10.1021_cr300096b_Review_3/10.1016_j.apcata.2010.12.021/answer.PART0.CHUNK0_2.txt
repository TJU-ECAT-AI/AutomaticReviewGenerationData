1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation and reverse micelle synthesis. Incipient wetness impregnation involves dissolving the metal salt in water slightly less than the pore volume of the support, aiming to maintain narrow particle size distributions. Reverse micelle synthesis, on the other hand, produces uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions. Both methods aim to control nanoparticle size during synthesis, enhancing the understanding of activity over supported catalysts, especially considering the impact of metal nanoparticle shape and size on catalyst performance.

2. In the context of the paper, reverse micelle synthesis offers the potential to synthesize size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts, providing an alternative to the common incipient wetness impregnation method. This approach allows for the production of uniform metal nanoparticles, which may lead to improved catalyst activity due to better control over particle size and morphology.

3. The paper demonstrates that when comparing the hydrogenation rate constant to CO uptake, the increase in activity with the bimetallic catalyst is more pronounced when considering the metal basis rather than the catalyst basis. This indicates that the enhanced activity is primarily attributed to the bimetallic interactions between Pt and Ni atoms, rather than just an increase in the total amount of metal present in the catalyst. The presence of bimetallic bonds, confirmed through EXAFS measurements, is a key factor contributing to the observed improvement in catalytic activity.

1. 支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括浸渍湿法和反乳液合成。浸渍湿法涉及将金属盐溶解在略小于支撑体孔体积的水中，旨在保持颗粒尺寸分布的狭窄范围。反乳液合成则通过在微乳液中化学还原金属前体来生产均匀的金属纳米粒子，从而实现纳米级别的控制。这两种方法都旨在通过合成过程控制纳米粒子尺寸，从而增强对支持型催化剂性能的理解，特别是考虑到金属纳米粒子的形状和大小对催化剂性能的影响。

2. 在论文中，反乳液合成提供了一种合成尺寸可控的支持型双金属催化剂的可能性，作为传统浸渍湿法合成的替代方法。这种方法允许生产均匀的金属纳米粒子，这可能由于更好的尺寸和形态控制而促进催化剂活性的提高。

3. 论文表明，在比较氢化速率常数与CO吸收时，与基于催化剂的计算相比，当基于金属质量考虑时，双金属催化剂的活性增加更为显著。这表明，活性增强的主要原因是Pt和Ni原子之间的双金属相互作用，而不是催化剂中金属总量的简单增加。通过EXAFS测量确认的双金属键的存在是观察到催化活性改善的关键因素。
