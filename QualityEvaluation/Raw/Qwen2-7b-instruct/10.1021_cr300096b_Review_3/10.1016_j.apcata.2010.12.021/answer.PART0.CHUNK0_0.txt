The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation and reverse micelle synthesis. Incipient wetness impregnation involves dissolving metal salts in water and impregnating them onto a support, typically followed by drying, calcination, and/or heating treatments. This method can lead to sintering and agglomeration of metal particles, making it challenging to maintain narrow particle size distributions. Reverse micelle synthesis, on the other hand, chemically reduces metal precursors within microemulsions, providing two major advantages: restriction of nanoparticle growth by surfactants, leading to uniform particle sizes, and dependence of nanoparticle size on the size of water droplets, allowing for control over particle size. This method enables the synthesis of size-controlled supported bimetallic catalysts, which can exhibit enhanced activity for specific chemical reactions, such as low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. The synthesis and characterization results of the study demonstrate the feasibility of using reverse micelle synthesis for producing bimetallic catalysts with improved activity and narrow particle size distributions.

支持双金属催化剂合成方法通常包括浸渍湿法和反微乳液合成。浸渍湿法涉及溶解金属盐在水中，并将它们浸渍到载体上，随后进行干燥、煅烧等处理。这种方法可能导致金属颗粒发生聚集和烧结，难以维持粒径分布的狭窄性。反微乳液合成则通过在微乳液中化学还原金属前体，提供两个主要优势：通过表面活性剂限制纳米颗粒生长，从而实现均匀的颗粒大小；以及水滴大小依赖于纳米颗粒的大小，允许对颗粒大小进行控制。这种方法能够合成粒径可控的支持双金属催化剂，这些催化剂可以表现出特定化学反应（如低温1,3-丁二烯氢化）的增强活性。研究的合成和表征结果表明，使用反微乳液合成方法制备具有改进活性和狭窄粒径分布的双金属催化剂的可能性。
