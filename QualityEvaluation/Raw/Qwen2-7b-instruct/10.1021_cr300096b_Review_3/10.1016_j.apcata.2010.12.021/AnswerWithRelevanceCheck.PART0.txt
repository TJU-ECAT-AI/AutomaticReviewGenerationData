          [1] "Catalyst design is a complicated matter that spans from the choice of metal precursors and supports to the thermal treatments the catalyst encounters before reaction."
          [2] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support."
          [3] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation."
          [4] "One of the model bimetallic systems that has been previously well-studied is the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface."
          [5] "The reverse micelle synthesis procedure was modified from previous work."
          [6] "The amount of Pt precursor impregnated on the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was measured to achieve a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, corresponding to a 1.67% weight loading of Pt."

          The synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts involves various methods such as incipient wetness impregnation, reverse micelle synthesis, dendrimer encapsulation, and self-assembly of diblock co-polymers into micelles. Incipient wetness impregnation is a traditional approach for preparing supported catalysts by dissolving metal salts in water equivalent to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support. However, this method often struggles to maintain narrow particle size distributions. The reverse micelle synthesis method, on the other hand, provides a way to control nanoparticle size, dendrimer encapsulation can encapsulate catalysts, and self-assembly allows for precise control over nanoparticle size and shape. One well-studied model bimetallic system is the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface, which exhibits enhanced hydrogenation activity at low temperatures. The reverse micelle synthesis procedure was adapted from previous work to synthesize uniform, reduced Ni nanoparticles, which were then supported on γ-Al2O3 and deposited with Pt using incipient wetness impregnation. To achieve a 1:3 atomic ratio of Pt:Ni, a 1.67% weight loading of Pt was measured on the Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

          支持双金属催化剂的合成涉及多种方法，例如浸渍湿法、反胶束合成、树状大分子包封和二嵌段共聚物自组装成胶束。浸渍湿法是一种传统的制备支持催化剂的方法，通过将金属盐溶解在与支撑体孔体积相当或略少的水中。然而，这种方法往往难以维持窄粒径分布。相反，反胶束合成方法提供了一种控制纳米颗粒尺寸的方式，树状大分子包封可以封装催化剂，而自组装则允许对纳米颗粒的大小和形状进行精确控制。一个已经被广泛研究的模型双金属系统是Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面，在低温下表现出增强的氢化活性。反胶束合成过程从先前的工作中进行了调整，以合成均匀的还原Ni纳米颗粒，然后将其负载到γ-Al2O3上，并使用浸渍湿法制备Pt。为了实现Pt：Ni的1：3原子比，测量了Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的1.67%质量负载的Pt。

          [7] "HAADF images collected using TEM showed that nanoparticle size was small (roughly 2 nm) and uniform before supporting and after high-temperature cleaning treatments in O2 and H2."
          [8] "AAS confirms that the majority of Ni is adsorbed onto the support, but the amount of Pt deposition during reverse micelle synthesis is limited."
          [9] "EXAFS measurements confirmed the PtNi bimetallic bond formation in the step-impregnated catalyst, which explained enhanced activity for low-temperature 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation."
          [10] "Overall, our synthesis and characterization results demonstrate the feasibility of using reverse micelle synthesis to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with narrow size distributions and with enhanced hydrogenation activity."

          High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images obtained with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the nanoparticle size was small (around 2 nm) and uniform both before and after high-temperature cleaning treatments using oxygen and hydrogen. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) confirmed that the majority of nickel (Ni) was adsorbed onto the support, but the amount of platinum (Pt) deposition during the reverse micelle synthesis was limited. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements validated the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bond in the catalyst prepared using the step-impregnation method, which contributed to the enhanced activity for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene at low temperatures. The overall synthesis and characterization outcomes illustrate the potential of employing reverse micelle synthesis to produce supported bimetallic catalysts with narrow particle size distributions and improved hydrogenation activity.

          使用透射电子显微镜（TEM）获得的高角度环形暗场（HAADF）图像显示，纳米颗粒的大小约为2 nm，并且在使用氧气和氢气进行高温清洁处理前后保持均匀。通过原子吸收光谱法（AAS）证实，大多数镍（Ni）被吸附到支撑体上，但在反胶束合成过程中沉积的铂（Pt）量有限。扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）测量验证了使用步进浸渍法制备的催化剂中形成的PtNi双金属键，这促进了低温下1,3-丁二烯氢化的增强活性。总体合成和表征结果展示了使用反胶束合成方法制备具有窄粒径分布和改善氢化活性的负载型双金属催化剂的潜力。
