[1] "Catalyst design is a complicated matter that spans from the choice of metal precursors and supports to the thermal treatments the catalyst encounters before reaction."
[2] "Published literature contains many accounts of the challenges of maintaining narrow particle size distributions using incipient wetness impregnation."
[3] "The reverse micelle synthesis method was used to synthesize supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts."
[4] "HAADF images collected using TEM showed that nanoparticle size was small (roughly 2 nm) and uniform before supporting and after high-temperature cleaning treatments in O2 and H2."
[5] "AAS confirms that the majority of Ni is adsorbed onto the support, but the amount of Pt deposition during reverse micelle synthesis is limited."
[6] "EXAFS measurements confirmed the PtNi bimetallic bond formation in the step-impregnated catalyst, which explained enhanced activity for low-temperature 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation."
[7] "Overall, our synthesis and characterization results demonstrate the feasibility of using reverse micelle synthesis to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with narrow size distributions and with enhanced hydrogenation activity."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include incipient wetness impregnation. This method involves dissolving metal salts in water to impregnate the support. However, this process often faces challenges in maintaining narrow particle size distributions. 

2. The reverse micelle synthesis method was investigated in this paper as an alternative approach to improve the nanoparticle size uniformity of bimetallic Pt/Ni nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3.
