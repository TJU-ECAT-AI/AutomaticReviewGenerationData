[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals."
[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods."
[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions."
[4] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals."
[5] "A more detailed description of this process has been published elsewhere."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods. These methods often result in catalysts with inadequate control over metal placement, leading to compositions with both isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) is an industrially-relevant process that allows for better control over metal placement, making it a preferred method for preparing bimetallic catalysts.

[8] "EpB contains two distinctly different functional groups, a CC bond and an epoxy group, which can undergo simple hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis (cleavage of a CC or CO bond), respectively, to form a wide variety of reaction products [11] ."
[9] "However, additional products may be formed from deoxygenation, CC hydrogenolysis, or from epoxide C(#4) bond cleavage [11] ,[16] ."
[10] "Butylene oxide (BO), formed by the selective hydrogenation of the CC bond, is perhaps the most desired product as it can readily be used to manufacture of a variety of chemicals including polyethers, alkylene glycols, epoxy resins, and fuel additives [17] ."
[11] "However, hydrogenation of epoxides using Group VIII metals typically results in hydrogenolysis of the CO bond [16] ."
[12] "In this study a family of catalysts has been synthesized to illustrate the effectiveness of the electroless deposition method to tune bimetallic surfaces for different catalytic purposes."
[13] "The levels of Ag deposition have been intentionally limited to sub-monolayer coverages on the Pt surface, as verified by selective H2 chemisorption on the Pt component of the AgPt bimetallic surface."
[14] "Although the same general trends are observed, the ED-derived catalysts exhibit more dramatic changes in activity and selectivity, suggesting a more targeted and efficient Ag placement on the Pt surface, which is supported by catalyst characterization data."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These methods often result in catalysts with inadequate control over metal placement, yielding a mixture of isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) is an industrially-relevant process that allows for the precise control of metal placement, enabling the targeted deposition of a second metal onto the surface of a pre-existing metal. This method provides more intimate contact between the metals than traditional methodologies, leading to improved catalyst performance and selectivity. In the present study, hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB) was chosen as a probe reaction because it contains two functional groups that can undergo hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis, leading to a wide variety of products. The results demonstrate that ED is effective for synthesizing bimetallic catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for different catalytic purposes.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的常见合成方法包括连续浸渍和共浸渍。这些方法往往导致催化剂中金属分布控制不足，产生孤立的单金属颗粒和成分不同的双金属颗粒混合物。电沉积（ED）是一个工业相关的过程，允许精确控制金属分布，使得将第二种金属精准地沉积到前一种金属表面成为可能。这种方法在金属之间提供了比传统方法更紧密的接触，从而提高了催化剂性能和选择性。在当前的研究中，选择了3,4-环氧丁-1-烯的氢化作为探针反应，因为该化合物包含两个可以进行氢化或氢解裂的官能团，可以形成多种产物。结果表明，ED是合成具有优化活性和不同催化用途的双金属催化剂的有效方法。

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. Traditional methods, however, often result in catalysts with inadequate control over metal placement, leading to compositions with both isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) is another industrially-relevant method that can be applied to a wide range of metals. In ED, the concentration of formaldehyde in the bath plays a crucial role as the rate-limiting step for metal activation.

2. The use of electroless deposition (ED) for synthesizing bimetallic catalysts allows for the controlled deposition of a second metal on the surface of a pre-existing metal, providing a more targeted placement of the metal compared to traditional methods. This results in enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in catalysts.

3. The addition of silver (Ag) to palladium (Pt) in the form of a supported catalyst significantly enhances the conversion of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB) without the catalyst being active for EpB hydrogenation itself. The enhanced activity is attributed to the modification of the Pt surface by the addition of small amounts of Ag, which seems to involve the Ag-induced reduction of the interaction between Ag and EpB.

4. Electroless deposition provides a more targeted placement of a second metal on the surface of a pre-existing metal, promoting the controlled deposition of even small amounts of the second metal. This results in a more precise control over the metal composition, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in catalysts compared to traditional synthesis methods.

1. 受益于额外金属的活性、选择性和稳定性改进，过去几十年中，双金属或多金属催化剂已经取代了单金属催化剂在工业过程中的应用。传统的合成方法，如连续浸渍和共浸渍，通常用于大规模生产双金属和多金属催化剂。然而，这些传统方法往往难以控制金属分布，导致催化剂中存在孤立的单金属颗粒和不同组成比例的双金属颗粒。电镀沉积（ED）是一种工业相关的方法，可以应用于多种金属，并且在ED过程中，甲醛的浓度作为关键步骤，决定了金属的激活速率。

2. 通过电镀沉积（ED）合成双金属催化剂，允许将第二金属精确地沉积在预存在的金属表面，相比传统方法提供更精准的金属分布，从而在催化剂中实现更高效的活性、选择性和稳定性。

3. 将银（Ag）添加到钯（Pt）中形成支持性催化剂，显著提高了3,4-环氧-1-丁烯（EpB）的转化率，而催化剂本身并不参与EpB氢化反应。增强的活性归因于Ag的存在，它似乎通过降低Ag与EpB之间的相互作用来修改Pt表面。

4. 电镀沉积提供了更精准的第二金属在预存金属表面的沉积，促进甚至微量的第二金属的精确控制沉积。这导致了与传统合成方法相比，更精确的金属组成控制，进而提高活性、选择性和稳定性。
