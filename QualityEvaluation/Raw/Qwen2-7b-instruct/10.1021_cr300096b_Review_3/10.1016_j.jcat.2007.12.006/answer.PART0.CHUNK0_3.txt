1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. Traditional methods, however, often result in catalysts with inadequate control over metal placement, leading to compositions with both isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) is another industrially-relevant method that can be applied to a wide range of metals. In ED, the concentration of formaldehyde in the bath plays a crucial role as the rate-limiting step for metal activation.

2. The use of electroless deposition (ED) for synthesizing bimetallic catalysts allows for the controlled deposition of a second metal on the surface of a pre-existing metal, providing a more targeted placement of the metal compared to traditional methods. This results in enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in catalysts.

3. The addition of silver (Ag) to palladium (Pt) in the form of a supported catalyst significantly enhances the conversion of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB) without the catalyst being active for EpB hydrogenation itself. The enhanced activity is attributed to the modification of the Pt surface by the addition of small amounts of Ag, which seems to involve the Ag-induced reduction of the interaction between Ag and EpB.

4. Electroless deposition provides a more targeted placement of a second metal on the surface of a pre-existing metal, promoting the controlled deposition of even small amounts of the second metal. This results in a more precise control over the metal composition, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability in catalysts compared to traditional synthesis methods.

1. 受益于额外金属的活性、选择性和稳定性改进，过去几十年中，双金属或多金属催化剂已经取代了单金属催化剂在工业过程中的应用。传统的合成方法，如连续浸渍和共浸渍，通常用于大规模生产双金属和多金属催化剂。然而，这些传统方法往往难以控制金属分布，导致催化剂中存在孤立的单金属颗粒和不同组成比例的双金属颗粒。电镀沉积（ED）是一种工业相关的方法，可以应用于多种金属，并且在ED过程中，甲醛的浓度作为关键步骤，决定了金属的激活速率。

2. 通过电镀沉积（ED）合成双金属催化剂，允许将第二金属精确地沉积在预存在的金属表面，相比传统方法提供更精准的金属分布，从而在催化剂中实现更高效的活性、选择性和稳定性。

3. 将银（Ag）添加到钯（Pt）中形成支持性催化剂，显著提高了3,4-环氧-1-丁烯（EpB）的转化率，而催化剂本身并不参与EpB氢化反应。增强的活性归因于Ag的存在，它似乎通过降低Ag与EpB之间的相互作用来修改Pt表面。

4. 电镀沉积提供了更精准的第二金属在预存金属表面的沉积，促进甚至微量的第二金属的精确控制沉积。这导致了与传统合成方法相比，更精确的金属组成控制，进而提高活性、选择性和稳定性。
