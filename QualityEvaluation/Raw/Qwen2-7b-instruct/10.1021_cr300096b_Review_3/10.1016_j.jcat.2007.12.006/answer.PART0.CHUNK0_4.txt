[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] ."
[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] ."
[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] ."
[4] "This complex mixture of particles results in poor control of the final catalyst performance and makes any definitive correlations between catalyst performance, catalyst characterization, and catalyst composition virtually impossible."
[5] "Therefore, new, reproducible methods are needed for the preparation of truly bimetallic catalysts."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. However, these methods often result in catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions, leading to poor control of the final catalyst performance. Electroless deposition (ED) is a feasible method that promotes the controlled deposition of even small amounts of a second metal on the surface of a pre-existing metal, providing a more targeted placement of the metal than traditional methods. ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是连续浸渍法和共浸渍法。然而，这些方法往往会导致催化剂中包含孤立的单金属颗粒和成分不同的双金属颗粒，这使得最终催化剂性能的控制变得困难，并且很难建立催化剂性能、催化剂表征和催化剂组成之间的明确关系。电沉积（ED）是一种可行的方法，它能够促进在预存金属表面甚至微量第二金属的可控沉积，从而提供与传统方法相比更为精确的金属放置。ED是一个工业相关的过程，可以应用于多种金属。
