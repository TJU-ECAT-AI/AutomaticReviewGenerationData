[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals."
[2] "These traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions."
[3] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals."
[4] "This methodology promotes the controlled deposition of even small amounts of a second metal on the surface of a pre-existing metal to give a more targeted placement of the metal than that obtained using traditional methodologies."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These methods often lead to a lack of control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts with both isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) stands out as an industrially-relevant process for preparing bimetallic catalysts, offering better control over metal placement compared to traditional methodologies. ED allows for the precise deposition of a second metal onto the surface of an existing metal, leading to a more targeted metal distribution on the catalyst.

常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法包括连续浸渍和共浸渍。这些方法通常会导致金属分布控制不足，产生包含孤立单金属颗粒和组成不同的双金属颗粒的催化剂。电沉积（ED）作为一种工业相关过程，可以应用于各种金属的制备，相较于传统方法提供了更好的金属分布控制。ED允许精确地将第二种金属沉积到现有金属表面，从而在催化剂上实现更精准的金属分布。
