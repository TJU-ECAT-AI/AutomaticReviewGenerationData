[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals [1] ,[2] ,[3] ."
[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods [4] ."
[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [5] ,[6] ,[7] ."
[4] "This complex mixture of particles results in poor control of the final catalyst performance and makes any definitive correlations between catalyst performance, catalyst characterization, and catalyst composition virtually impossible."
[5] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process [8] ,[9] that can be applied to a wide range of metals [8] ."
[6] "A more detailed description of this process has been published elsewhere [10] ."
[7] "In the present study, hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB) was selected as a probe reaction."
[8] "EpB contains two distinctly different functional groups, a CC bond and an epoxy group, which can undergo simple hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis (cleavage of a CC or CO bond), respectively, to form a wide variety of reaction products [11] ."
[9] "However, additional products may be formed from deoxygenation, CC hydrogenolysis, or from epoxide C(#4) bond cleavage [11] ,[16] ."
[10] "Butylene oxide (BO), formed by the selective hydrogenation of the CC bond, is perhaps the most desired product as it can readily be used to manufacture of a variety of chemicals including polyethers, alkylene glycols, epoxy resins, and fuel additives [17] ."
[11] "However, hydrogenation of epoxides using Group VIII metals typically results in hydrogenolysis of the CO bond [16] ."
[12] "In this study a family of catalysts has been synthesized to illustrate the effectiveness of the electroless deposition method to tune bimetallic surfaces for different catalytic purposes."
[13] "The levels of Ag deposition have been intentionally limited to sub-monolayer coverages on the Pt surface, as verified by selective H2 chemisorption on the Pt component of the AgPt bimetallic surface."
[14] "Although the same general trends are observed, the ED-derived catalysts exhibit more dramatic changes in activity and selectivity, suggesting a more targeted and efficient Ag placement on the Pt surface, which is supported by catalyst characterization data."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These methods often result in catalysts with inadequate control over metal placement, yielding a mixture of isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) is an industrially-relevant process that allows for the precise control of metal placement, enabling the targeted deposition of a second metal onto the surface of a pre-existing metal. This method provides more intimate contact between the metals than traditional methodologies, leading to improved catalyst performance and selectivity. In the present study, hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EpB) was chosen as a probe reaction because it contains two functional groups that can undergo hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis, leading to a wide variety of products. The results demonstrate that ED is effective for synthesizing bimetallic catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for different catalytic purposes.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的常见合成方法包括连续浸渍和共浸渍。这些方法往往导致催化剂中金属分布控制不足，产生孤立的单金属颗粒和成分不同的双金属颗粒混合物。电沉积（ED）是一个工业相关的过程，允许精确控制金属分布，使得将第二种金属精准地沉积到前一种金属表面成为可能。这种方法在金属之间提供了比传统方法更紧密的接触，从而提高了催化剂性能和选择性。在当前的研究中，选择了3,4-环氧丁-1-烯的氢化作为探针反应，因为该化合物包含两个可以进行氢化或氢解裂的官能团，可以形成多种产物。结果表明，ED是合成具有优化活性和不同催化用途的双金属催化剂的有效方法。
