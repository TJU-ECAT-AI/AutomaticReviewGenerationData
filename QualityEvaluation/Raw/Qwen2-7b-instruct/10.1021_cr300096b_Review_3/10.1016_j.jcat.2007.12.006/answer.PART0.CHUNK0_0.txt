[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals."
[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods."
[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions."
[4] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals."
[5] "A more detailed description of this process has been published elsewhere."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods. These methods often result in catalysts with inadequate control over metal placement, leading to compositions with both isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) is an industrially-relevant process that allows for better control over metal placement, making it a preferred method for preparing bimetallic catalysts.

1. 制备双金属或多金属催化剂的最常用方法是连续浸渍法或共浸渍法。这些方法通常会导致催化剂中金属分布控制不足，产生包含孤立单金属颗粒和组成不同的双金属颗粒的催化剂。电镀沉积（ED）是一种工业相关的过程，可以应用于多种金属，它能够更好地控制金属分布，因此是制备双金属催化剂的首选方法。
