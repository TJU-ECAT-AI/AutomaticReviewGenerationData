The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include chemical reduction, thermal decomposition, and solvothermal reactions. Chemical reduction offers precise control over particle size and shape, making it advantageous for specific applications requiring precise catalyst properties. Thermal decomposition provides uniform particle sizes, which is beneficial for catalysts where size consistency is crucial. Solvothermal reactions enable the formation of complex structures and shapes, potentially leading to enhanced catalytic activity due to unique surface features. These methods are compared based on their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production.
