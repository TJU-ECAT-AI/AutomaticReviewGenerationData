          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include co-precipitation, impregnation, and sol-gel techniques. Co-precipitation provides high control over particle size and shape, while impregnation enables precise loading of metals onto the support. Sol-gel processing results in a homogeneous dispersion of metal nanoparticles.
