The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the deposition-precipitation method. This method involves precipitating metal salts followed by reduction to form metal particles on the support. The use of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles provides several advantages such as better control over the size and shape of the final catalyst particles, improved stability, activity, and selectivity compared to traditional supported catalysts. Dendrimers facilitate the controlled release of the active species during the reduction process, allowing for easier loading onto a support material.
