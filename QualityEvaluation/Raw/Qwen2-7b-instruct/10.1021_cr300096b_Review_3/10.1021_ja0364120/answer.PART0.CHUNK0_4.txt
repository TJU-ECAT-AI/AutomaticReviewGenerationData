The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within dendrimers. This method provides a controlled environment for the growth of the nanoparticles, allowing for precise control over their size, shape, and distribution on the support material. The dendrimers act as stabilizers and protectors for the nanoparticles during the synthesis process.
