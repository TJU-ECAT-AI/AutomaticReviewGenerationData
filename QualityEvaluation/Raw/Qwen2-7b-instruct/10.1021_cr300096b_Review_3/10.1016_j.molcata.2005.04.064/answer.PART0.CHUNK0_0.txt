The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants, which form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles. This method allows for the successful preparation of metal nanoparticles with diameters of a few nanometers. The advantage of these methods lies in their ability to produce catalysts with controlled particle sizes and compositions. Compared to traditional methods of preparing metal blacks, which typically yield larger particles or aggregates, this approach offers better control over the catalyst's structure, leading to improved performance in various catalytic reactions. Additionally, incorporating the intended support during the synthesis process often results in superior catalyst samples, enhancing their efficiency and selectivity in specific applications.
