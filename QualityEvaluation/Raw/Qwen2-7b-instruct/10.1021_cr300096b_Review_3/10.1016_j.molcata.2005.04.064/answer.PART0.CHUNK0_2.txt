[1] "Monometallic Pt and Pd [18,19] as well as PdPt particles [2022] were synthesized and tested in catalytic reactions [23]."
[2] "The present paper deals with the preparation of PdPt powders of different composition (precipitation in the presence of surfactants), their characterization by photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) and electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM) in the as prepared state, as well as after reduction."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation in the presence of surfactants. These methods offer several potential advantages such as precise control over particle size and morphology, and they are generally considered effective for catalyst production. The literature highlights the preparation of PdPt powders with varying compositions through this method, followed by characterization using advanced techniques like XPS, UPS, TEM, and HRTEM both in the as-prepared state and after reduction. This approach allows for detailed analysis of the catalyst's structure and composition, which is crucial for understanding its behavior and optimizing its performance in catalytic reactions.
