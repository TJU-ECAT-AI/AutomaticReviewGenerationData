[1] "Monometallic Pt and Pd [18,19] as well as PdPt particles [2022] were synthesized and tested in catalytic reactions [23]."
[2] "The synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."
[3] "These behaved as conventional impregnated catalysts [18,20]."
[4] "Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve reducing metal salts in the presence of a surfactant, such as tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C14TABr). This method allows for the creation of nanoparticles with diameters of a few nanometers. When the synthesis takes place in the presence of the intended support, superior catalyst samples are typically produced. These bimetallic particles behave similarly to conventional impregnated catalysts but can offer enhanced performance when synthesized with the support involved.

对于支持型双金属催化剂，常用的合成方法是在表面活性剂（如十四烷基三甲基溴化铵C14TABr）的存在下还原金属盐。这种方法能够产生直径为几个纳米的纳米颗粒。当在预期的支撑物存在下进行合成时，通常可以获得更优秀的催化剂样品。这些双金属粒子的行为类似于传统的浸渍催化剂，但在与所涉及的支撑物结合合成时，可以提供增强的性能。
