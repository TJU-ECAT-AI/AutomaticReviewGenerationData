2.1. "Unfortunately, in the case of the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics to the corresponding anilines, the activity of the Au/TiO2 catalyst could be too low for practical applications."
2.2. "The challenge was then to increase the catalyst activity while preserving its high chemoselectivity."
2.3. "A new optimised bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalyst has been prepared."
2.4. "Thanks to the presence of Pt, the amount of dissociated H2 available on the catalyst surface increases."
2.5. "The resultant catalyst is the most effective catalyst reported, up to now, for hydrogenating nitroaromatic compounds in the presence of other sensitive functionalities."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are deposition-precipitation techniques, which involve depositing metal precursors onto the surface of a support material. These methods offer potential advantages in terms of precise control over the loading of metals and the formation of supported catalysts with tailored properties. The efficacy of these methods largely depends on the specific synthesis conditions, such as the pH of deposition, loading of metal, and calcination temperature, which can lead to variations in the size and morphology of the metal particles. The application of these methods is broad, including the production of catalysts for various chemical transformations, with the goal of enhancing activity and selectivity. In the context of the literature provided, the deposition-precipitation technique was used to synthesize gold catalysts, and a subsequent optimization led to the development of a bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalyst, which exhibited superior activity and selectivity for hydrogenating nitroaromatic compounds compared to monometallic gold catalysts.
