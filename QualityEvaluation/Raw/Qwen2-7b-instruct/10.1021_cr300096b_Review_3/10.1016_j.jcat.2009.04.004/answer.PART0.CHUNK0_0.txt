2.1. "The discovery of gold catalysts for the production of substituted anilines and related derivatives has opened up new possibilities around the chemistry of nitrogenated compounds [1] ,[2] ."
2.2. "Regarding the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, the use of synthesis procedures to create well-dispersed metal, and especially gold nanoparticles, onto the appropriated support allows designing processes where inefficient stoichiometric reducing agents such as sodium hydrosulfide [3] , iron [4] , tin [5] or zinc in ammonium hydroxide [6] , or catalysts based on PbPt/CaCO3 with iron salts in solution or H3PO2Pt/C with vanadium salts in solution [7] ,[8] can be substituted by more efficient and greener catalytic systems."
2.3. "Unfortunately, in the case of the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics to the corresponding anilines, the activity of the Au/TiO2 catalyst could be too low for practical applications [2] ."
2.4. "When attempting to design a more efficient catalyst, it is highly desirable to know the molecular mechanism and the catalytic active sites involved."
2.5. "In the present work, a kinetic and isotopic study has been carried out, which has allowed finding that the rate-controlling step for the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics on Au/TiO2 corresponds to the dissociation of H2 on the gold nanoparticles."
2.6. "Taking this into account, a new optimised bimetallic AuPt/TiO2 catalyst has been prepared."
2.7. "Thanks to the presence of Pt, the amount of dissociated H2 available on the catalyst surface increases, resulting in a solid that is almost one order of magnitude more active than the corresponding monometallic gold material, and can work in solvent-free media."
2.8. "Meanwhile, the high chemoselectivity of gold is preserved."

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts are often synthesized using deposition-precipitation techniques, which involve dispersing metals onto a support material. This method offers advantages in creating catalysts with tailored properties, enhancing activity, and selectivity compared to traditional synthesis methods.

2. Synthesis procedures typically involve dispersing metals like gold and platinum onto a support such as titanium dioxide. These methods enable the creation of well-dispersed metal nanoparticles, which can lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic systems compared to conventional reducing agents.

3. The hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatic compounds using gold catalysts might suffer from insufficient activity for practical applications, necessitating the development of more effective catalysts.

4. Knowledge of the molecular mechanism and active sites involved in catalysis is crucial for the design of improved catalysts.

5. A kinetic and isotopic study revealed that the rate-controlling step for hydrogenating substituted nitroaromatics on gold/titanium dioxide catalysts is the dissociation of hydrogen on gold nanoparticles.

6. By incorporating platinum into the catalyst, the amount of dissociated hydrogen available on the catalyst surface increases, leading to a catalyst that is significantly more active than a pure gold catalyst.

7. This optimized bimetallic catalyst can function effectively in solvent-free media, maintaining the high chemoselectivity characteristic of gold catalysts.

8. The presence of platinum in the catalyst enhances its activity while preserving the selective hydrogenation properties of gold.
