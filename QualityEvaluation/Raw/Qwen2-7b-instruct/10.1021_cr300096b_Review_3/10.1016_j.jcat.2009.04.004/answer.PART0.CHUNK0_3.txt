[1] "The discovery of gold catalysts for the production of substituted anilines and related derivatives has opened up new possibilities around the chemistry of nitrogenated compounds [1] ,[2] ."
[2] "Unfortunately, in the case of the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics to the corresponding anilines, the activity of the Au/TiO2 catalyst could be too low for practical applications [2] ."
[3] "It has been found that, with this catalyst, the controlling step corresponds to the dissociation of H2 on gold atoms of low coordination."
[4] "Taking this into account, a new bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 solid has been prepared that, when optimised, increases the rate of H2 dissociation while preserving high chemoselectivity."
[5] "The resultant catalyst is the most effective catalyst reported, up to now, for hydrogenating nitroaromatic compounds in the presence of other sensitive functionalities."
[6] "Bimetallic goldplatinum catalysts with optimised Pt contents have been designed through kinetic and isotopic studies, showing the highest activity reported up to now for the chemoselective hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatic compounds."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include deposition-precipitation techniques. These methods offer advantages such as the ability to create well-dispersed metal nanoparticles onto appropriate supports, which allows for the design of processes that substitute inefficient reducing agents with more efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic systems. In the context of the document, these methods led to the preparation of a new bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 solid, which when optimized, significantly increases the rate of H2 dissociation while maintaining high chemoselectivity. This catalyst is the most effective one reported for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds in the presence of other sensitive functionalities.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括沉积-沉淀技术。这些方法的优势在于能够将金属纳米颗粒均匀分散到合适的载体上，这使得能够设计出用更高效、更环保的催化系统取代效率较低还原剂的过程。在本文档的背景下，这种方法导致制备了一种新的Au@Pt/TiO2固体，当优化时，显著增加了氢气解离速率，同时保持了高化学选择性。这种催化剂是迄今为止报道的用于在其他敏感功能存在下氢化硝基芳族化合物的最有效催化剂。
