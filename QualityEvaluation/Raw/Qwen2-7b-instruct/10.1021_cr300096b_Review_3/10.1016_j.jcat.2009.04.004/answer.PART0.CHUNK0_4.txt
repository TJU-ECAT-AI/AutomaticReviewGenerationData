[1] "Regarding the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, the use of synthesis procedures to create well-dispersed metal, and especially gold nanoparticles, onto the appropriated support allows designing processes where inefficient stoichiometric reducing agents such as sodium hydrosulfide, iron, tin, or zinc in ammonium hydroxide, or catalysts based on PbPt/CaCO3 with iron salts in solution or H3PO2Pt/C with vanadium salts in solution, can be substituted by more efficient and greener catalytic systems."
[2] "Unfortunately, in the case of the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics to the corresponding anilines, the activity of the Au/TiO2 catalyst could be too low for practical applications."
[3] "Taking this into account, a new optimised bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalyst has been prepared. Thanks to the presence of Pt, the amount of dissociated H2 available on the catalyst surface increases, resulting in a solid that is almost one order of magnitude more active than the corresponding monometallic gold material, and can work in solvent-free media."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve creating well-dispersed metals, particularly gold nanoparticles, onto an appropriate support. This method allows for the substitution of less efficient and environmentally harmful reducing agents with more effective and eco-friendly catalytic systems. For the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, the activity of a monometallic gold catalyst on a titanium dioxide support might be insufficient for practical applications. To address this, a new bimetallic gold-palladium catalyst was synthesized, which, due to the presence of palladium, significantly increases the amount of dissociated hydrogen available on the catalyst surface. This leads to a catalyst that is approximately ten times more active than its monometallic gold counterpart and can operate effectively in solvent-free environments.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法涉及在合适的支撑材料上分散金属，特别是金纳米颗粒。这种方法允许用更有效且环保的还原剂替代效率较低、对环境有害的催化剂。对于硝基芳族化合物的氢化反应，单金属金催化剂在二氧化钛上的活性可能不足以满足实际应用需求。为解决这一问题，制备了一种新的双金属金-钯催化剂。由于钯的存在，该催化剂表面可提供大量解离的氢分子，使其活性约为纯金催化剂的十倍，并且可以在无溶剂条件下有效工作。
