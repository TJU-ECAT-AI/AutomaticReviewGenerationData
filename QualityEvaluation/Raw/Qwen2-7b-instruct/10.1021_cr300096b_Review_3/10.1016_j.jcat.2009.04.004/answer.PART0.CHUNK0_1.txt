[1] "The discovery of gold catalysts for the production of substituted anilines and related derivatives has opened up new possibilities around the chemistry of nitrogenated compounds [1] ,[2] ."
[2] "Unfortunately, in the case of the hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics to the corresponding anilines, the activity of the Au/TiO2 catalyst could be too low for practical applications [2] ."
[3] "A new bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 solid has been prepared that, when optimised, increases the rate of H2 dissociation while preserving high chemoselectivity."
[4] "Taking this into account, a new optimised bimetallic AuPt/TiO2 catalyst has been prepared. Thanks to the presence of Pt, the amount of dissociated H2 available on the catalyst surface increases, resulting in a solid that is almost one order of magnitude more active than the corresponding monometallic gold material, and can work in solvent-free media."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include deposition-precipitation techniques. These methods offer advantages such as precise control over the size and morphology of the metal nanoparticles, leading to improved catalytic performance. By incorporating a second metal like platinum (Pt) into the gold (Au) catalyst, the amount of dissociated hydrogen (H2) available on the catalyst surface increases, enhancing the catalyst's activity by nearly an order of magnitude compared to a monometallic gold catalyst. This improvement allows the catalyst to operate effectively in solvent-free media.

支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括沉积-沉淀技术。这些方法提供了精确控制金属纳米颗粒大小和形态的优势，从而提高催化性能。通过在金（Au）催化剂中加入第二种金属如铂（Pt），催化剂表面可解离的氢（H2）量增加，使催化剂的活性相比单一金属的金催化剂提高近一个数量级。这种改进允许催化剂在无溶剂介质中有效运行。
