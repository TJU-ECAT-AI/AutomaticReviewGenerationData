The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include deposition-precipitation techniques. These methods offer advantages such as precise control over the size and morphology of the metal nanoparticles, leading to improved catalytic performance. By incorporating a second metal like platinum (Pt) into the gold (Au) catalyst, the amount of dissociated hydrogen (H2) available on the catalyst surface increases, enhancing the catalyst's activity by nearly an order of magnitude compared to a monometallic gold catalyst. This improvement allows the catalyst to operate effectively in solvent-free media.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are deposition-precipitation techniques, which involve depositing metal precursors onto the surface of a support material. These methods offer potential advantages in terms of precise control over the loading of metals and the formation of supported catalysts with tailored properties. The efficacy of these methods largely depends on the specific synthesis conditions, such as the pH of deposition, loading of metal, and calcination temperature, which can lead to variations in the size and morphology of the metal particles. The application of these methods is broad, including the production of catalysts for various chemical transformations, with the goal of enhancing activity and selectivity. In the context of the literature provided, the deposition-precipitation technique was used to synthesize gold catalysts, and a subsequent optimization led to the development of a bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalyst, which exhibited superior activity and selectivity for hydrogenating nitroaromatic compounds compared to monometallic gold catalysts.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve creating well-dispersed metals, particularly gold nanoparticles, onto an appropriate support. This method allows for the substitution of less efficient and environmentally harmful reducing agents with more effective and eco-friendly catalytic systems. For the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, the activity of a monometallic gold catalyst on a titanium dioxide support might be insufficient for practical applications. To address this, a new bimetallic gold-palladium catalyst was synthesized, which, due to the presence of palladium, significantly increases the amount of dissociated hydrogen available on the catalyst surface. This leads to a catalyst that is approximately ten times more active than its monometallic gold counterpart and can operate effectively in solvent-free environments.
