[1] "In addition to monometallic DENs, it is also possible to prepare bimetallic materials that have either random alloy or core/shell structures."
[2] "DENs are stable for long periods of time, although some metals, such as Cu and Ag, easily oxidize in air."
[3] "This means that the rates of reactions catalyzed by DENs are often rather slow."
[4] "We know that catalytic reactions occurring within DENs can lead to unusual product distributions, but the scope and underlying reasons for this observation are not known."
[5] "However, surface-confined DENs can be activated by removing the dendrimer, and in favorable cases this does not lead to too much aggregation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Bimetallic materials with random alloy or core/shell structures can be prepared using dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs).
2. Some metals, like copper (Cu) and silver (Ag), tend to oxidize in air, affecting the stability of DENs.
3. The catalytic rates of DENs are often slower compared to traditional catalysts.
4. The specific scope and underlying mechanisms behind unusual product distributions in DEN-catalyzed reactions are not fully understood.
5. Removing the dendrimer can activate surface-confined DENs, leading to catalytic activity without significant aggregation.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 可以通过使用Dendrimer-Encapsulated Nanoparticles（DENs）来制备具有随机合金或核壳结构的二元金属材料。
2. 部分金属，如铜（Cu）和银（Ag），在空气中容易氧化，影响DENs的稳定性。
3. DENs的催化速率往往较慢，相比传统催化剂而言。
4. 对于DEN介导的反应中产生异常产物分布的具体范围及其背后的原因还不完全清楚。
5. 移除Dendrimer可以使表面限制的DENs激活，导致催化活性而不会引起过多的聚集。
