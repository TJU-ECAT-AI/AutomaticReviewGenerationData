[1] "In addition to monometallic DENs, it is also possible to prepare bimetallic materials that have either random alloy or core/shell structures."
[2] "DENs can be rendered soluble in water, organic and fluorous solvents, and even in liquid and supercritical CO2, and this provides a major opportunity to study metal-particle-catalyzed reactions in unusual solvent environments."
[3] "We also know that catalytic reactions occurring within DENs can lead to unusual product distributions, but the scope and underlying reasons for this observation are not known."
[4] "We know that catalytically active DENs can be recycled by attaching appropriate functional groups on the periphery of the dendrimer."
[5] "In the absence of solvent or in the presence of a poor solvent, dendrimers collapse around the encapsulated metal nanoparticle and that this shuts off catalytic activity."
[6] "However, surface-confined DENs can be activated by removing the dendrimer, and in favorable cases this does not lead to too much aggregation."

1. Bimetallic DENs can be synthesized with random alloy or core/shell structures. 
2. DENs can be made soluble in various solvents, including CO2, offering opportunities to study reactions in unconventional media.  
3. Catalytic reactions within DENs can produce unusual product distributions, but the full range and reasons behind this phenomenon are still unknown. 
4. Recyclability of catalytically active DENs is enhanced by adding suitable peripheral functional groups.
5. In poor solvent conditions, dendrimers constrict around encapsulated metal nanoparticles, inhibiting catalytic activity.
6. Surface-restricted DENs can regain activity upon dendrimer removal, with minimal aggregation in favorable scenarios.

1. 双金属DENs可以制成随机合金或核壳结构。 
2. DENs可以在各种溶剂中溶解，包括超临界二氧化碳，为研究在非传统介质中的反应提供了机会。  
3. DEN内的催化反应可以产生异常的产品分布，但这种现象的完整范围和原因仍不清楚。
4. 通过在树状分子的外围添加合适的功能基团，可以提高催化活性DEN的可回收性。
5. 在不良溶剂条件下，树状大分子会紧缩在封装的金属纳米粒子周围，从而抑制催化活性。
6. 表面受限的DENs在去除树状大分子后可以重新激活，且在有利情况下不会引起过多的聚集。
