<quotes>
[1] "In addition to monometallic DENs, it is also possible to prepare bimetallic materials that have either random alloy or core/shell structures."
[2] "DENs can be rendered soluble in water, organic and fluorous solvents, and even in liquid and supercritical CO2, and this provides a major opportunity to study metal-particle-catalyzed reactions in unusual solvent environments."
[3] "We also know that catalytic reactions occurring within DENs can lead to unusual product distributions, but the scope and underlying reasons for this observation are not known."
[4] "We know that catalytically active DENs can be recycled by attaching appropriate functional groups on the periphery of the dendrimer."
[5] "In the absence of solvent or in the presence of a poor solvent, dendrimers collapse around the encapsulated metal nanoparticle and that this shuts off catalytic activity."
[6] "However, surface-confined DENs can be activated by removing the dendrimer, and in favorable cases this does not lead to too much aggregation."

[1] "We have shown that metal ions having an affinity for tertiary amines are sequestered within the interior of PAMAM and PPI dendrimers. Following chemical reduction, HRTEM, SAXS, and catalysis experiments confirm that these ions are reduced to atoms and that the atoms aggregate into nanoparticles having sizes that reflect the original metal-ion-to-dendrimer ratio."
[2] "We also know that DENs can be extracted from within the interior of dendrimers without aggregation and without major changes in size or chemical composition."
[3] "For example, we have shown that Pd DENs prepared using PPI dendrimers modified on their periphery with perfluorinated polyether chains can catalyze the Heck coupling of n-butylacrylate with a range of aryl halides in biphasic fluorous/organic solvents."
[4] "We also know that in the absence of solvent or in the presence of a poor solvent, dendrimers collapse around the encapsulated metal nanoparticle and that this shuts off catalytic activity."
[5] "We know that catalytic reactions occurring within DENs can lead to unusual product distributions, but the scope and underlying reasons for this observation are not known."
[6] "We know that DENs can be immobilized on surfaces and used for electrocatalysis and other forms of heterogeneous catalysis."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Metal ions that can bind to tertiary amines are enclosed in the interior of PAMAM and PPI dendrimers. After chemical reduction, the ions are transformed into atoms that aggregate into nanoparticles whose sizes match the original metal-ion-to-dendrimer ratio. DENs can be extracted from dendrimers without aggregation or significant size or composition changes. 

2. Pd DENs created using PPI dendrimers modified with perfluorinated polyether chains can catalyze the Heck coupling of n-butylacrylate with various aryl halides in biphasic fluorous/organic solvents.

3. In the absence of solvent or with a poor solvent, dendrimers constrict around the encapsulated metal nanoparticles, which inhibits catalytic activity.

4. Processes occurring within DENs can produce atypical product distributions, but the extent and reasons behind this phenomenon are not fully understood.

5. DENs can be anchored onto surfaces and utilized for electrocatalysis and other heterogeneous catalysis methods.

2. 使用含氟聚醚链修饰的PPI树状体的Pd DENs可以催化n-丁基丙烯酸酯与各种芳基卤化物在二相氟素/有机溶剂中的Heck耦合。

3. 在缺乏溶剂或使用不良溶剂的情况下，树状体会围绕封装的金属纳米颗粒收缩，从而抑制催化活性。

[1] "Heterogeneous catalysts can be prepared using DENs by immobilizing the dendrimer template onto a solid support."
[2] "After this step it may be desirable to remove the dendrimer from the encapsulated nanoparticle, but removal of the dendrimer may lead to an increase in both the particle size and the particle-size distribution."
[3] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)."
[4] "However, upon calcination at 630 C the particles grew into large aggregates."
[5] "For example, Pd DENs encapsulated within G6-NH2 were found to have strong interactions with the step edges of HOPG surfaces."
[6] "But upon calcination at 630 C, the particles grew into large aggregates."
[7] "In contrast, we have recently shown that temperatures of 500 C (in air) are required to remove PAMAM dendrimers from Pd or Au DENs supported on titania."
[8] "Calcination using these conditions leads to particle growth; for example, the average particle size of G4-Q32(Au55) nanoparticles deposited on titania increased from 1.7  0.4 nm to 7.2  3.6 nm."
</quotes>

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts can be produced using dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) by first immobilizing the dendrimer template onto a solid support.

2. After immobilizing the dendrimer, removing it might seem desirable, but doing so can cause the particle size and size distribution to increase.

3. Initial attempts to create dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts involved using Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).

4. However, when calcinated at 630°C, the particles aggregated into large clusters.

5. Pd DENs within G6-NH2 were observed to have strong interactions with the step edges of HOPG surfaces.

6. Unfortunately, calcination at 630°C resulted in the particles aggregating into large clusters.

7. In contrast, our recent research has demonstrated that removing PAMAM dendrimers from Pd or Au DENs supported on titania requires temperatures of 500°C in air.

8. Using these conditions, the particle size increased; for instance, the average particle size of G4-Q32(Au55) nanoparticles deposited on titania escalated from 1.7 ± 0.4 nm to 7.2 ± 3.6 nm.

1. 使用DENs可以制备支持型双金属催化剂，方法是首先将树状体模板固定到固体支撑物上。

2. 在移除模板后，可能希望提高颗粒大小和粒度分布，但这种做法可能导致颗粒增大。

3. 初步尝试使用包含在G6-NH2中的Pd DENs支持在mica或高定向石墨（HOPG）上来制备无模板的异相催化剂。

4. 然而，在630°C下热处理时，这些颗粒聚集成了大型簇。

5. 包含在G6-NH2中的Pd DENs被发现在HOPG表面的台阶边缘有很强的相互作用。

6. 不幸的是，在630°C下热处理后，这些颗粒聚集成了大型簇。

7. 相反，我们的最新研究表明，从氧化钛上支持的Pd或Au DENs中移除PAMAM树状体需要在空气中加热至500°C。

8. 使用这种方法，颗粒大小增加；例如，G4-Q32(Au55)纳米颗粒沉积在氧化钛上的平均颗粒大小从1.7±0.4 nm增加到了7.2±3.6 nm。
