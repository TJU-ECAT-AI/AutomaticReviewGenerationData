[1] "We have shown that metal ions having an affinity for tertiary amines are sequestered within the interior of PAMAM and PPI dendrimers. Following chemical reduction, HRTEM, SAXS, and catalysis experiments confirm that these ions are reduced to atoms and that the atoms aggregate into nanoparticles having sizes that reflect the original metal-ion-to-dendrimer ratio."
[2] "We also know that DENs can be extracted from within the interior of dendrimers without aggregation and without major changes in size or chemical composition."
[3] "For example, we have shown that Pd DENs prepared using PPI dendrimers modified on their periphery with perfluorinated polyether chains can catalyze the Heck coupling of n-butylacrylate with a range of aryl halides in biphasic fluorous/organic solvents."
[4] "We also know that in the absence of solvent or in the presence of a poor solvent, dendrimers collapse around the encapsulated metal nanoparticle and that this shuts off catalytic activity."
[5] "We know that catalytic reactions occurring within DENs can lead to unusual product distributions, but the scope and underlying reasons for this observation are not known."
[6] "We know that DENs can be immobilized on surfaces and used for electrocatalysis and other forms of heterogeneous catalysis."

1. Metal ions that can bind to tertiary amines are enclosed in the interior of PAMAM and PPI dendrimers. After chemical reduction, the ions are transformed into atoms that aggregate into nanoparticles whose sizes match the original metal-ion-to-dendrimer ratio. DENs can be extracted from dendrimers without aggregation or significant size or composition changes. 

2. Pd DENs created using PPI dendrimers modified with perfluorinated polyether chains can catalyze the Heck coupling of n-butylacrylate with various aryl halides in biphasic fluorous/organic solvents.

3. In the absence of solvent or with a poor solvent, dendrimers constrict around the encapsulated metal nanoparticles, which inhibits catalytic activity.

4. Processes occurring within DENs can produce atypical product distributions, but the extent and reasons behind this phenomenon are not fully understood.

5. DENs can be anchored onto surfaces and utilized for electrocatalysis and other heterogeneous catalysis methods.

1. 具有与三甲胺亲和性的金属离子被保留在PAMAM和PPI树状体的内部。化学还原后，离子转化为原子并聚集成大小反映原始金属离子与树状体比例的纳米颗粒。DEN可以从树状体中提取而不会出现聚集或显著的尺寸或组成变化。

2. 使用含氟聚醚链修饰的PPI树状体的Pd DENs可以催化n-丁基丙烯酸酯与各种芳基卤化物在二相氟素/有机溶剂中的Heck耦合。

3. 在缺乏溶剂或使用不良溶剂的情况下，树状体会围绕封装的金属纳米颗粒收缩，从而抑制催化活性。

4. 发生在DEN内的过程可能会产生非典型的产物分布，但这种现象的范围和背后的原因尚不完全清楚。

5. DENs可以被固定到表面上并用于电催化和其他异相催化方法。
