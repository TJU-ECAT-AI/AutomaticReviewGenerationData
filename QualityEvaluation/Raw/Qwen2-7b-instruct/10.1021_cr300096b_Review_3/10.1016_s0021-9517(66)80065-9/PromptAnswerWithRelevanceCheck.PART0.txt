[1] "In most of these investigations, the platinum was impregnated on alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by calcination in air, and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at about 500C."
[2] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity meas- urements."
[3] "The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[4] "For catalysts prepared in this way with platinum concentrations less than 1.0 wt %, the results generally indicated that the ratio of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom was close to unity, suggesting high dispersion of the platinum on the support."
[5] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the ease of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnating the support with a solution of chloroplatinic acid, followed by calcination in air and subsequent reduction in hydrogen. These methods are effective for achieving high dispersion of platinum on the support, which influences the catalytic activity of the resulting catalyst. In the context of this study, the platinum was impregnated on alumina or silica-alumina supports, and the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum was found to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole at a moderate surface coverage of 70%. The dispersion of the platinum on alumina was found to be much higher than on silica-alumina, leading to a significant difference in catalytic activity. The difference in catalytic activity between the two supports was attributed to the difference in platinum dispersion, not the surface area, indicating that the intrinsic catalytic properties of platinum were not affected by the support. However, the study suggests that the effect of the support can vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and reaction under study.

支持双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是将氯铂酸溶液浸渍到支撑体上，随后在空气中煅烧，然后在氢气中进行还原。这些方法对于实现铂在支撑体上的高分散效果非常有效，进而影响催化剂的催化活性。在本研究中，铂被浸渍在氧化铝或硅藻土氧化铝上作为支持体，并发现在铂表面覆盖率为70%左右时，氢吸附于铂上的反应为放热反应，放出能量约为7-8 kcal/mole。在氧化铝上的铂分散度远高于在硅藻土氧化铝上，导致两种催化剂的活性存在显著差异。活性差异被归因于铂的分散度不同，而不是表面面积，表明铂的内在催化性质不受支撑体的影响。然而，研究指出，支撑体的作用可能根据具体催化剂和反应的不同而变化。

1. The commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid. These methods are straightforward and effective in loading the desired metal onto the support.

2. The method of preparation involves impregnating alumina or silica-alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by drying and calcination in air. This process ensures a uniform distribution of platinum across the support.

3. The chemisorption data indicates that the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum catalysts is exothermic, especially at higher surface coverages. This implies that the energy released during the adsorption process exceeds the energy absorbed, leading to a net release of energy.

4. The adsorption data can be utilized to estimate the average crystallite size of the platinum on the two different supports. Smaller crystallite sizes might indicate better dispersion of the platinum, which could influence the catalytic activity.

5. The rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation is quantified based on the amount of cyclohexane fed per hour and the weight of the catalyst. The rate is then calculated considering the conversion level, providing insight into the efficiency of the catalyst.

1. 针对负载型双金属催化剂的常见合成方法包括使用氯铂酸浸渍载体。这些方法简便有效，能够将所需金属均匀负载到载体上。

2. 准备过程包括使用水性氯铂酸溶液浸渍氧化铝或硅酸铝，随后干燥并在空气中进行1小时的煅烧至540°C。此步骤确保铂在载体上的均匀分布。

3. 化学吸附数据表明，氢在铂催化剂上的吸附为放热反应，特别是在较高的表面覆盖率下。这意味着吸附过程中释放的能量超过吸收的能量，导致净能量释放。

4. 通过化学吸附数据可以估算两种不同支撑物上铂的平均晶粒尺寸。较小的晶粒尺寸可能表示铂的更好分散，这可能会影响催化活性。

5. 环己烷脱氢化速率基于每小时添加的环己烷量和催化剂的重量进行量化。然后根据转化率计算速率，提供催化剂效率的见解。

[1] "Several groups of workers have recently investigated the chemisorption of hydrogen on supported platinum catalysts."
[2] "The platinum was impregnated on alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by calcination in air, and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at about 500C."
[3] "For catalysts prepared in this way with platinum concentrations less than 1.0 wt %, the results generally indicated that the ratio of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom was close to unity, suggesting high dispersion of the platinum on the support."
[4] "The adsorption of hydrogen on the alumina, at either 200 or 300C, is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on:alumina catalyst."
[5] "From the hydrogen chemisorption data,an estimate of the average crystallite size of the platinum on the two different supports can be made."
[6] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x."
[7] "However, it is possible that the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst may have been limited to some degree by pore diffusion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller than the true ratio of catalytic activities."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnating the metal onto the support material using aqueous solutions of the metal salts, followed by calcination in air and reduction in hydrogen. These methods allow for high dispersion of the metal on the support, which is beneficial for catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the metal concentration, the type of support, and the reduction conditions. The literature shows that for platinum catalysts, the adsorption of hydrogen is higher on alumina than on silica-alumina, suggesting better dispersion of platinum on alumina. The specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is not affected by the support, indicating that the support primarily influences the degree of dispersion of the metal rather than its intrinsic catalytic properties.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是使用水溶液中的金属盐将金属浸渍到支撑材料上，随后在空气中煅烧并在氢气中还原。这些方法允许金属在支撑材料上的高分散，这对于催化活性是有利的。这些方法的有效性取决于诸如金属浓度、支撑类型和还原条件等因素。文献表明，对于铂催化剂，氢的吸附在氧化铝上高于硅酸铝，这表明在氧化铝上铂的分散更好。铂对环己烷脱氢的特定催化活性不受支撑的影响，表明支撑主要影响金属的分散程度而不是其内在的催化性质。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnating the support with chloroplatinic acid, followed by calcination in air and reduction in hydrogen. These methods typically yield a high dispersion of platinum on the support, especially when the platinum concentration is below 1.0 wt %. The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage is often exothermic, with an estimated enthalpy of adsorption of 7-8 kcal/mole. The difference in dispersion between platinum on alumina and silica-alumina is significant, with the platinum surface area being about one-tenth as great on silica-alumina. The specific catalytic activity of the platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support, whereas the role of the support is mainly to affect the degree of dispersion of the active catalytic component. The effect of the support on the catalytic activity can vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and reaction under study.
