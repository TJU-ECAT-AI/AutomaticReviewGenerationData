[1] "In most of these investigations, the platinum was impregnated on alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by calcination in air, and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at about 500C."
[2] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements."
[3] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the case of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnating the support with chloroplatinic acid. This process typically includes calcination in air followed by reduction in hydrogen. These methods offer advantages in controlling the dispersion of metals on the support, influencing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The differences in the effectiveness of these methods depend on factors such as metal concentration, support type, and the specific reaction conditions. The quote "[2]" highlights that the dispersion of platinum is influenced by the concentration of metal employed, which can affect the catalytic activity.
