[1] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements."
[2] "The platinum catalysts used in this work were prepared by impregnation of alumina or silica-alumina with aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by drying and subsequent calcination in air for 1 hr at 540C."
[3] "The adsorption at 200 is higher than at 300, indicating that the adsorption is exothermic."
[4] "From the hydrogen chemisorption data,an estimate of the average crystallite size of the platinum on the two different supports can be made."
[5] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."

1. The commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid. These methods are straightforward and effective in loading the desired metal onto the support.

2. The method of preparation involves impregnating alumina or silica-alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by drying and calcination in air. This process ensures a uniform distribution of platinum across the support.

3. The chemisorption data indicates that the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum catalysts is exothermic, especially at higher surface coverages. This implies that the energy released during the adsorption process exceeds the energy absorbed, leading to a net release of energy.

4. The adsorption data can be utilized to estimate the average crystallite size of the platinum on the two different supports. Smaller crystallite sizes might indicate better dispersion of the platinum, which could influence the catalytic activity.

5. The rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation is quantified based on the amount of cyclohexane fed per hour and the weight of the catalyst. The rate is then calculated considering the conversion level, providing insight into the efficiency of the catalyst.

1. 针对负载型双金属催化剂的常见合成方法包括使用氯铂酸浸渍载体。这些方法简便有效，能够将所需金属均匀负载到载体上。

2. 准备过程包括使用水性氯铂酸溶液浸渍氧化铝或硅酸铝，随后干燥并在空气中进行1小时的煅烧至540°C。此步骤确保铂在载体上的均匀分布。

3. 化学吸附数据表明，氢在铂催化剂上的吸附为放热反应，特别是在较高的表面覆盖率下。这意味着吸附过程中释放的能量超过吸收的能量，导致净能量释放。

4. 通过化学吸附数据可以估算两种不同支撑物上铂的平均晶粒尺寸。较小的晶粒尺寸可能表示铂的更好分散，这可能会影响催化活性。

5. 环己烷脱氢化速率基于每小时添加的环己烷量和催化剂的重量进行量化。然后根据转化率计算速率，提供催化剂效率的见解。
