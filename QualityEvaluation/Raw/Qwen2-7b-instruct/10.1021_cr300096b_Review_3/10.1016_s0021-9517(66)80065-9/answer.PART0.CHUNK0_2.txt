[1] "Several groups of workers have recently investigated the chemisorption of hydrogen on supported platinum catalysts."
[2] "The platinum was impregnated on alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by calcination in air, and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at about 500C."
[3] "For catalysts prepared in this way with platinum concentrations less than 1.0 wt %, the results generally indicated that the ratio of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom was close to unity, suggesting high dispersion of the platinum on the support."
[4] "The adsorption of hydrogen on the alumina, at either 200 or 300C, is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on:alumina catalyst."
[5] "From the hydrogen chemisorption data,an estimate of the average crystallite size of the platinum on the two different supports can be made."
[6] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x."
[7] "However, it is possible that the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst may have been limited to some degree by pore diffusion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller than the true ratio of catalytic activities."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnating the metal onto the support material using aqueous solutions of the metal salts, followed by calcination in air and reduction in hydrogen. These methods allow for high dispersion of the metal on the support, which is beneficial for catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the metal concentration, the type of support, and the reduction conditions. The literature shows that for platinum catalysts, the adsorption of hydrogen is higher on alumina than on silica-alumina, suggesting better dispersion of platinum on alumina. The specific catalytic activity of platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is not affected by the support, indicating that the support primarily influences the degree of dispersion of the metal rather than its intrinsic catalytic properties.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是使用水溶液中的金属盐将金属浸渍到支撑材料上，随后在空气中煅烧并在氢气中还原。这些方法允许金属在支撑材料上的高分散，这对于催化活性是有利的。这些方法的有效性取决于诸如金属浓度、支撑类型和还原条件等因素。文献表明，对于铂催化剂，氢的吸附在氧化铝上高于硅酸铝，这表明在氧化铝上铂的分散更好。铂对环己烷脱氢的特定催化活性不受支撑的影响，表明支撑主要影响金属的分散程度而不是其内在的催化性质。
