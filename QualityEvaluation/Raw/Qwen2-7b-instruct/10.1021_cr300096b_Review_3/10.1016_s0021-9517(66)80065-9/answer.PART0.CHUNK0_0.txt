[1] "In most of these investigations, the platinum was impregnated on alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by calcination in air, and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at about 500C."
[2] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity meas- urements."
[3] "The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[4] "For catalysts prepared in this way with platinum concentrations less than 1.0 wt %, the results generally indicated that the ratio of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom was close to unity, suggesting high dispersion of the platinum on the support."
[5] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the ease of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnating the support with a solution of chloroplatinic acid, followed by calcination in air and subsequent reduction in hydrogen. These methods are effective for achieving high dispersion of platinum on the support, which influences the catalytic activity of the resulting catalyst. In the context of this study, the platinum was impregnated on alumina or silica-alumina supports, and the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum was found to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole at a moderate surface coverage of 70%. The dispersion of the platinum on alumina was found to be much higher than on silica-alumina, leading to a significant difference in catalytic activity. The difference in catalytic activity between the two supports was attributed to the difference in platinum dispersion, not the surface area, indicating that the intrinsic catalytic properties of platinum were not affected by the support. However, the study suggests that the effect of the support can vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and reaction under study.

支持双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是将氯铂酸溶液浸渍到支撑体上，随后在空气中煅烧，然后在氢气中进行还原。这些方法对于实现铂在支撑体上的高分散效果非常有效，进而影响催化剂的催化活性。在本研究中，铂被浸渍在氧化铝或硅藻土氧化铝上作为支持体，并发现在铂表面覆盖率为70%左右时，氢吸附于铂上的反应为放热反应，放出能量约为7-8 kcal/mole。在氧化铝上的铂分散度远高于在硅藻土氧化铝上，导致两种催化剂的活性存在显著差异。活性差异被归因于铂的分散度不同，而不是表面面积，表明铂的内在催化性质不受支撑体的影响。然而，研究指出，支撑体的作用可能根据具体催化剂和反应的不同而变化。
