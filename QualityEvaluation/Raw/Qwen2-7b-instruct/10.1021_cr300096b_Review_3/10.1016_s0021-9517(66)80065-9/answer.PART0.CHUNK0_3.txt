[1] "In most of these investigations, the platinum was impregnated on alumina with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by calcination in air, and subsequent reduction in hydrogen at about 500C."
[2] "The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity meas- urements."
[3] "For catalysts prepared in this way with platinum concentrations less than 1.0 wt %, the results generally indicated that the ratio of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom was close to unity, suggesting high dispersion of the platinum on the support."
[4] "In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[5] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the ease of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."
[6] "The rates of dehydrogenation were deter- mined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quan- tity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of eyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[7] "In other words, the specific catalytic activity of the platinum (rate per unit platinum surface area) for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support."
[8] "However, it should not be concluded that the role of the support is in general limited only to its effect on the surface area of the active catalytic component."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve impregnating the support with chloroplatinic acid, followed by calcination in air and reduction in hydrogen. These methods typically yield a high dispersion of platinum on the support, especially when the platinum concentration is below 1.0 wt %. The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage is often exothermic, with an estimated enthalpy of adsorption of 7-8 kcal/mole. The difference in dispersion between platinum on alumina and silica-alumina is significant, with the platinum surface area being about one-tenth as great on silica-alumina. The specific catalytic activity of the platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support, whereas the role of the support is mainly to affect the degree of dispersion of the active catalytic component. The effect of the support on the catalytic activity can vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and reaction under study.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括将氯铂酸浸渍到载体上，随后在空气中进行煅烧并在氢气中进行还原。这些方法通常能够使铂在载体上的分散度很高，尤其是在铂浓度低于1.0 wt %的情况下。在适度高的表面覆盖率下，氢吸附在铂上的过程往往是放热的，估计的吸附焓为7-8 kcal/mole。铂在氧化铝和硅铝氧化物上的分散度差异显著，铂表面面积在硅铝氧化物上仅为氧化铝的十分之一。铂在环己烷脱氢反应中的特定催化活性基本上不受支持体的影响，而支持体的作用主要在于影响活性催化成分的分散度。支持体对催化活性的影响因所使用的具体催化剂和研究的反应而异。
