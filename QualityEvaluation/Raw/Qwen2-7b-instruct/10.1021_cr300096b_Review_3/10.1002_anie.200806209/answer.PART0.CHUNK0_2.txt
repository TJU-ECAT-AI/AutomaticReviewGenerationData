[1] "Depending on the heat of segregation and the surface mixing energy, the composition of the surface of a bimetallic system can be very different from the bulk."
[2] "This effect is additionally dependent upon the chemical potential of the gas phase, since the strong bonding of adsorbates will result in a gain in energy of the system."
[3] "For this purpose the catalyst was subject to either a gas-phase treatment, or an electrochemical treatment."
[4] "Both methods lead to the same structure, comprising a PtxCoy alloy core with a Pt shell (see Scheme1)."
[5] "The coreshell nanoparticles were also investigated as possible catalyst candidates for oxygen reduction (ORR), which is a key reaction in fuel-cell technology."
[6] "Studies on polycrystalline and single-crystal model systems have shown that alloying Pt with a first-row transition metal leads to an increase in specific activity by a factor of 24."
[7] "In alkaline solution the activity normalized to the mass of Pt of the untreated Pt3Co catalyst is comparable to that of a Pt HSAC catalyst, whereas after a CO-annealing treatment, it increases significantly by a factor of 2.53."
[8] "In acid electrolyte the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst also shows superior activity; compared to plain Pt HSAC the specific activity increased by a factor of 3."
[9] "Interestingly, the CO-annealed Pt3Co nanoparticles are also more active than the chemical-leached sample, as has recently been reported for Pt3Co bulk alloys."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are gas-phase treatments and electrochemical treatments. These methods are advantageous because they enable the formation of core-shell nanoparticles with a Pt shell around a PtxCoy core, leading to a highly active catalyst with a low amount of noble metal. The gas-phase treatment involves placing the catalyst powder into a rotary evaporator and filling it with CO under controlled conditions. The electrochemical treatment involves subjecting the catalyst to potential cycling in CO-saturated electrolyte. Both methods result in a Pt shell surrounding a PtxCoy core, enhancing the catalyst's performance for oxygen reduction in fuel-cell technology. Compared to plain Pt HSAC catalysts, the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst shows superior activity, increasing by factors of 2.53 in alkaline solution and 3 in acid electrolyte. It also outperforms chemically leached samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of CO annealing in catalyst preparation.

最常使用的支持双金属催化剂合成方法是气相处理和电化学处理。这些方法的优势在于能够形成具有Pt壳层围绕PtxCoy核心的核壳纳米粒子，从而得到含有少量贵金属的活性催化剂。气相处理方法包括将催化剂粉末放入旋转蒸发器中，并在控制条件下填充CO。电化学处理方法涉及使催化剂在饱和CO电解液中进行电位循环。两种方法都能形成围绕PtxCoy核心的Pt壳层，增强催化剂在燃料电池技术中的氧还原性能。与纯Pt HSAC催化剂相比，经过CO退火处理的Pt3Co催化剂表现出更优的活性，分别在碱性溶液中增加2.53倍，在酸性电解质中增加3倍。它还优于化学浸出样品，证明了CO退火在催化剂制备中的有效性。
