[1] "Depending on the heat of segregation and the surface mixing energy, the composition of the surface of a bimetallic system can be very different from the bulk."
[2] "This effect is additionally dependent upon the chemical potential of the gas phase, since the strong bonding of adsorbates will result in a gain in energy of the system."
[3] "As a consequence, for bimetallic systems, an enrichment at the surface of the component that binds a certain adsorbate more strongly may occur."
[4] "We use this process to modify an un-leached, carbon-supported Pt3Co alloy high-surface-area catalyst (HSAC) to increase the utilization of platinum in the particles."
[5] "For HSAC catalysts, however, this is generally more complicated."
[6] "To determine the surface condition of the catalyst nanoparticles we used cyclic voltammetry in alkaline electrolyte (Figure1a)."
[7] "Moreover, for the CO-annealed catalyst, the additional oxidation peak at low potentials (0.4VRHE) in the CO-stripping curves (Figure1b), which is an unambiguous sign of Co surface atoms, is not present anymore."
[8] "The coreshell nanoparticles were also investigated as possible catalyst candidates for oxygen reduction (ORR), which is a key reaction in fuel-cell technology."
[9] "Studies on polycrystalline and single-crystal model systems have shown that alloying Pt with a first-row transition metal leads to an increase in specific activity by a factor of 24."
[10] "In acid electrolyte the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst also shows superior activity; compared to plain Pt HSAC the specific activity increased by a factor of 3 (Figure2)."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods aim to achieve coreshell structures with an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell. However, they have significant disadvantages, such as loss in active surface area and material, formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation.

2. The CO-annealing treatment modifies the surface composition of carbon-supported Pt3Co catalyst particles by causing platinum atoms to segregate to the particle surface. This results in the formation of nanoparticles with a platinum shell surrounding an alloy core. This modification leads to a superior activity in the oxygen reduction reaction compared to both a plain platinum catalyst and the untreated alloy particles.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. High-temperature annealing involves heating the catalyst to alter its structure. Chemical leaching selectively removes one component of the alloy, typically the non-noble metal, leaving behind a noble-metal shell. Electrochemical deposition techniques involve depositing the noble metal onto a substrate through electrochemical processes. These methods have varying degrees of success, with high-temperature annealing potentially causing material loss and incomplete noble-metal coverage, while chemical leaching can lead to a loss in active surface area and material. The novel preparation procedure described here uses an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect to overcome these issues, creating a Pt shell around a PtxCoy core without the drawbacks of traditional methods.

常用的双金属催化剂合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属材料化学浸出和电沉积技术。高温退火通过加热改变催化剂结构。化学浸出选择性地去除合金中的一个成分，通常是非贵金属，留下贵金属外壳。电沉积技术则是通过电化学过程在基体上沉积贵金属。这些方法的成功程度不同，高温退火可能导致材料损失和不完全的贵金属覆盖，而化学浸出则可能导致活性表面积损失和材料损耗。这里描述的新型制备程序利用吸附剂诱导的表面分层效应克服这些问题，在不采用传统方法的缺点的情况下，形成了包含Pt壳的PtxCoy核心。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are gas-phase treatments and electrochemical treatments. These methods are advantageous because they enable the formation of core-shell nanoparticles with a Pt shell around a PtxCoy core, leading to a highly active catalyst with a low amount of noble metal. The gas-phase treatment involves placing the catalyst powder into a rotary evaporator and filling it with CO under controlled conditions. The electrochemical treatment involves subjecting the catalyst to potential cycling in CO-saturated electrolyte. Both methods result in a Pt shell surrounding a PtxCoy core, enhancing the catalyst's performance for oxygen reduction in fuel-cell technology. Compared to plain Pt HSAC catalysts, the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst shows superior activity, increasing by factors of 2.53 in alkaline solution and 3 in acid electrolyte. It also outperforms chemically leached samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of CO annealing in catalyst preparation.

最常使用的支持双金属催化剂合成方法是气相处理和电化学处理。这些方法的优势在于能够形成具有Pt壳层围绕PtxCoy核心的核壳纳米粒子，从而得到含有少量贵金属的活性催化剂。气相处理方法包括将催化剂粉末放入旋转蒸发器中，并在控制条件下填充CO。电化学处理方法涉及使催化剂在饱和CO电解液中进行电位循环。两种方法都能形成围绕PtxCoy核心的Pt壳层，增强催化剂在燃料电池技术中的氧还原性能。与纯Pt HSAC催化剂相比，经过CO退火处理的Pt3Co催化剂表现出更优的活性，分别在碱性溶液中增加2.53倍，在酸性电解质中增加3倍。它还优于化学浸出样品，证明了CO退火在催化剂制备中的有效性。

High-temperature annealing can achieve coreshell structures but has significant disadvantages such as the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation. Chemical leaching of the non-noble material can also form coreshell structures, but it results in an incomplete noble-metal shell. Electrochemical deposition techniques offer another method to create coreshell structures, but it requires potential control and can lead to an alteration of the particle size.

The adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect, utilized in this study, offers a novel preparation procedure for coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell. This method uses CO annealing to modify an un-leached, carbon-supported Pt3Co alloy HSAC catalyst, resulting in a superior activity in the oxygen reduction reaction compared to both a plain platinum catalyst and the untreated alloy particles. The CO annealing process leads to a platinum shell surrounding a PtxCoy core, which increases the utilization of platinum in the particles without altering the particle size or causing active-surface-area loss.

The specific activity of the CO-annealed Pt3Co HSAC catalyst is significantly improved compared to the untreated Pt3Co catalyst and plain Pt HSAC catalysts in both alkaline and acidic solutions. The CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst also shows superior activity compared to a chemical-leached Pt3Co sample, confirming that CO annealing induces a similar effect as thermal annealing but with better preservation of the particle size and active surface area.

支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属材料的化学浸出和电沉积技术。高温退火可以实现核壳结构，但存在活性表面积和材料损失、非贵金属外壳不完整以及准备过程中需要控制电压等显著缺点。化学浸出技术也能形成核壳结构，但会导致非贵金属外壳不完整。电沉积技术提供另一种创建核壳结构的方法，但也需要控制电压，并可能导致颗粒尺寸的变化。

本文中利用吸附剂诱导的表面分层效应提出了一种新型制备铂壳核纳米粒子的程序。这种方法使用CO退火来修改未浸出的碳支持的Pt3Co合金高比表面积催化剂（HSAC），结果在氧还原反应中形成了具有明显优越性的催化剂，与纯铂催化剂和未处理的合金颗粒相比。CO退火过程导致铂壳围绕PtxCoy内核，提高了铂在颗粒中的利用率，同时没有改变颗粒大小或造成活性表面积损失。

CO退火Pt3Co HSAC催化剂的特定活性在碱性和酸性溶液中与未经处理的Pt3Co催化剂和纯铂HSAC催化剂相比有了显著提高。与化学浸出的Pt3Co样品相比，CO退火Pt3Co催化剂也显示出更高的活性，这进一步证实了CO退火产生的效果类似于热退火，但能更好地保持颗粒尺寸和活性表面区域。

However, these methods exhibit significant disadvantages, such as the loss of active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation. To overcome these issues, an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect was used to modify an un-leached, carbon-supported Pt3Co alloy high-surface-area catalyst, increasing the utilization of platinum in the particles. This process allows for the detection of the surface condition of catalyst nanoparticles using surface-sensitive techniques like low-energy ion scattering. The CO-annealing method specifically causes platinum atoms to segregate to the surface of the nanoparticles, displacing cobalt to the core, forming a Pt shell around an alloy core without any leaching of cobalt into the electrolyte. This technique results in a highly active catalyst with a low amount of noble metal, showing promising potential for various reactions requiring noble-metal surfaces, not only for oxygen reduction but also for other reactions. Compared to plain Pt HSAC catalysts, the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst demonstrates superior activity in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, increasing the specific activity by factors of 2.53 and 3, respectively.

常用的双金属催化剂合成方法包括将颗粒尺寸减小到纳米级，以增加每单位质量的特定表面积，并从中受益电子结构的变化。这些方法旨在仅在表面放置催化活性金属，确保反应速率不会因存在不活跃的核心材料而受到影响。然而，这些方法表现出显著的缺点，如活性表面积和材料的损失、形成不完整的贵金属外壳以及准备过程中需要对电位进行控制。为了克服这些问题，使用了吸附剂诱导的表面分选效应来修改未泄漏的碳支持的Pt3Co合金高表面积催化剂，以增加铂在粒子中的利用率。这种方法允许通过表面敏感技术，如低能离子散射检测催化剂纳米颗粒的表面状态。CO退火方法特别导致铂原子聚集在纳米颗粒的表面上，将钴置换到核心中，形成围绕合金核心的铂壳，而不会将钴泄漏到电解质中。该技术产生了一种含有少量贵金属的高活性催化剂，显示出在各种需要贵金属表面的反应（不仅限于氧气还原反应）方面的巨大潜力。与纯Pt HSAC催化剂相比，CO退火后的Pt3Co催化剂在碱性和酸性电解质中的活性均有所提高，在碱性电解质中的特定活性增加了2.53倍，在酸性电解质中的特定活性提高了3倍。
