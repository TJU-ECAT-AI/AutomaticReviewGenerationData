[1] "Depending on the heat of segregation and the surface mixing energy, the composition of the surface of a bimetallic system can be very different from the bulk."
[2] "For HSAC catalysts, however, this is generally more complicated."
[3] "By analysis of the adsorption/desorption properties in argon-purged electrolyte and comparison to an untreated Pt HSAC (Figure1a), it is evident that the untreated catalyst surface consists of both Pt and Co atoms, whereas after CO-annealing a Pt shell containing no Co atoms has been formed on the particle surface."
[4] "The coreshell nanoparticles were also investigated as possible catalyst candidates for oxygen reduction (ORR), which is a key reaction in fuel-cell technology."
[5] "Studies on polycrystalline and single-crystal model systems have shown that alloying Pt with a first-row transition metal leads to an increase in specific activity by a factor of 24.7,19"
[6] "In alkaline solution the activity normalized to the mass of Pt of the untreated Pt3Co catalyst is comparable to that of a Pt HSAC catalyst, whereas after a CO-annealing treatment, it increases significantly by a factor of 2.53."
[7] "In acid electrolyte the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst also shows superior activity; compared to plain Pt HSAC the specific activity increased by a factor of 3."
[8] "Interestingly, the CO-annealed Pt3Co nanoparticles are also more active than the chemical-leached sample, as has recently been reported for Pt3Co bulk alloys."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. High-temperature annealing involves heating the catalyst to alter its structure. Chemical leaching selectively removes one component of the alloy, typically the non-noble metal, leaving behind a noble-metal shell. Electrochemical deposition techniques involve depositing the noble metal onto a substrate through electrochemical processes. These methods have varying degrees of success, with high-temperature annealing potentially causing material loss and incomplete noble-metal coverage, while chemical leaching can lead to a loss in active surface area and material. The novel preparation procedure described here uses an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect to overcome these issues, creating a Pt shell around a PtxCoy core without the drawbacks of traditional methods.

常用的双金属催化剂合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属材料化学浸出和电沉积技术。高温退火通过加热改变催化剂结构。化学浸出选择性地去除合金中的一个成分，通常是非贵金属，留下贵金属外壳。电沉积技术则是通过电化学过程在基体上沉积贵金属。这些方法的成功程度不同，高温退火可能导致材料损失和不完全的贵金属覆盖，而化学浸出则可能导致活性表面积损失和材料损耗。这里描述的新型制备程序利用吸附剂诱导的表面分层效应克服这些问题，在不采用传统方法的缺点的情况下，形成了包含Pt壳的PtxCoy核心。
