[1] "Depending on the heat of segregation and the surface mixing energy, the composition of the surface of a bimetallic system can be very different from the bulk."
[2] "For HSAC catalysts, however, this is generally more complicated."
[3] "By analysis of the adsorption/desorption properties in argon-purged electrolyte and comparison to an untreated Pt HSAC (Figure1a), it is evident that the untreated catalyst surface consists of both Pt and Co atoms, whereas after CO-annealing a Pt shell containing no Co atoms has been formed on the particle surface."
[4] "Studies on polycrystalline and single-crystal model systems have shown that alloying Pt with a first-row transition metal leads to an increase in specific activity by a factor of 24.7,19 A similar improvement in catalytic activity could be observed on the CO-annealed Pt3Co HSAC in this study (see Table1)."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. High-temperature annealing can achieve coreshell structures but has significant disadvantages such as the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation. Chemical leaching of the non-noble material can also form coreshell structures, but it results in an incomplete noble-metal shell. Electrochemical deposition techniques offer another method to create coreshell structures, but it requires potential control and can lead to an alteration of the particle size.

The adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect, utilized in this study, offers a novel preparation procedure for coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell. This method uses CO annealing to modify an un-leached, carbon-supported Pt3Co alloy HSAC catalyst, resulting in a superior activity in the oxygen reduction reaction compared to both a plain platinum catalyst and the untreated alloy particles. The CO annealing process leads to a platinum shell surrounding a PtxCoy core, which increases the utilization of platinum in the particles without altering the particle size or causing active-surface-area loss.

The specific activity of the CO-annealed Pt3Co HSAC catalyst is significantly improved compared to the untreated Pt3Co catalyst and plain Pt HSAC catalysts in both alkaline and acidic solutions. The CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst also shows superior activity compared to a chemical-leached Pt3Co sample, confirming that CO annealing induces a similar effect as thermal annealing but with better preservation of the particle size and active surface area.

支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属材料的化学浸出和电沉积技术。高温退火可以实现核壳结构，但存在活性表面积和材料损失、非贵金属外壳不完整以及准备过程中需要控制电压等显著缺点。化学浸出技术也能形成核壳结构，但会导致非贵金属外壳不完整。电沉积技术提供另一种创建核壳结构的方法，但也需要控制电压，并可能导致颗粒尺寸的变化。

本文中利用吸附剂诱导的表面分层效应提出了一种新型制备铂壳核纳米粒子的程序。这种方法使用CO退火来修改未浸出的碳支持的Pt3Co合金高比表面积催化剂（HSAC），结果在氧还原反应中形成了具有明显优越性的催化剂，与纯铂催化剂和未处理的合金颗粒相比。CO退火过程导致铂壳围绕PtxCoy内核，提高了铂在颗粒中的利用率，同时没有改变颗粒大小或造成活性表面积损失。

CO退火Pt3Co HSAC催化剂的特定活性在碱性和酸性溶液中与未经处理的Pt3Co催化剂和纯铂HSAC催化剂相比有了显著提高。与化学浸出的Pt3Co样品相比，CO退火Pt3Co催化剂也显示出更高的活性，这进一步证实了CO退火产生的效果类似于热退火，但能更好地保持颗粒尺寸和活性表面区域。
