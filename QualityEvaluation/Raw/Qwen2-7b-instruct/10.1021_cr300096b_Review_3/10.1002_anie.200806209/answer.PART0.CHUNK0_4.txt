[1] "One approach is to decrease the size of catalyst particles down to the nanometer range to increase the specific surface area per mass, but also to benefit from a change in the electronic structure."
[2] "Ideally only the catalytically active metal is located at the surface, where the reactions take place; the reaction rate should not suffer as a result of the inactive core material."
[3] "A promising class of fuel-cell-cathode catalysts are alloys of platinum with other transition metals."
[4] "All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."
[5] "We use this process to modify an un-leached, carbon-supported Pt3Co alloy high-surface-area catalyst (HSAC) to increase the utilization of platinum in the particles."
[6] "Such a surface-annealing effect can be easily detected on bulk model systems using surface-sensitive techniques, such as low-energy ion scattering."
[7] "For HSAC catalysts, however, this is generally more complicated."
[8] "Moreover, for the CO-annealed catalyst, the additional oxidation peak at low potentials (0.4VRHE) in the CO-stripping curves (Figure1b), which is an unambiguous sign of Co surface atoms, is not present anymore."
[9] "In alkaline solution the activity normalized to the mass of Pt of the untreated Pt3Co catalyst is comparable to that of a Pt HSAC catalyst, whereas after a CO-annealing treatment, it increases significantly by a factor of 2.53."
[10] "In acid electrolyte the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst also shows superior activity; compared to plain Pt HSAC the specific activity increased by a factor of 3 (Figure2)."
[11] "In contrast to thermal annealing, however, CO annealing is better suited for nanocatalysts, since the particle size remains unaltered (see Supporting Information) and no active-surface-area loss occurs."
[12] "Such catalysts prepared by this CO annealing procedure have very promising potential, not only for the oxygen reduction, but also for other reactions requiring noble-metal surfaces."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include decreasing the particle size to the nanometer range to increase the specific surface area per mass and benefiting from a change in the electronic structure. These methods aim to place only the catalytically active metal at the surface, ensuring the reaction rate does not suffer due to the presence of inactive core material. However, these methods exhibit significant disadvantages, such as the loss of active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation. To overcome these issues, an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect was used to modify an un-leached, carbon-supported Pt3Co alloy high-surface-area catalyst, increasing the utilization of platinum in the particles. This process allows for the detection of the surface condition of catalyst nanoparticles using surface-sensitive techniques like low-energy ion scattering. The CO-annealing method specifically causes platinum atoms to segregate to the surface of the nanoparticles, displacing cobalt to the core, forming a Pt shell around an alloy core without any leaching of cobalt into the electrolyte. This technique results in a highly active catalyst with a low amount of noble metal, showing promising potential for various reactions requiring noble-metal surfaces, not only for oxygen reduction but also for other reactions. Compared to plain Pt HSAC catalysts, the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst demonstrates superior activity in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, increasing the specific activity by factors of 2.53 and 3, respectively.

常用的双金属催化剂合成方法包括将颗粒尺寸减小到纳米级，以增加每单位质量的特定表面积，并从中受益电子结构的变化。这些方法旨在仅在表面放置催化活性金属，确保反应速率不会因存在不活跃的核心材料而受到影响。然而，这些方法表现出显著的缺点，如活性表面积和材料的损失、形成不完整的贵金属外壳以及准备过程中需要对电位进行控制。为了克服这些问题，使用了吸附剂诱导的表面分选效应来修改未泄漏的碳支持的Pt3Co合金高表面积催化剂，以增加铂在粒子中的利用率。这种方法允许通过表面敏感技术，如低能离子散射检测催化剂纳米颗粒的表面状态。CO退火方法特别导致铂原子聚集在纳米颗粒的表面上，将钴置换到核心中，形成围绕合金核心的铂壳，而不会将钴泄漏到电解质中。该技术产生了一种含有少量贵金属的高活性催化剂，显示出在各种需要贵金属表面的反应（不仅限于氧气还原反应）方面的巨大潜力。与纯Pt HSAC催化剂相比，CO退火后的Pt3Co催化剂在碱性和酸性电解质中的活性均有所提高，在碱性电解质中的特定活性增加了2.53倍，在酸性电解质中的特定活性提高了3倍。
