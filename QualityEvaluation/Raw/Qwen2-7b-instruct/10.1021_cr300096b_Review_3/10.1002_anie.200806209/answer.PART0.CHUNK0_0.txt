[1] "Depending on the heat of segregation and the surface mixing energy, the composition of the surface of a bimetallic system can be very different from the bulk."
[2] "This effect is additionally dependent upon the chemical potential of the gas phase, since the strong bonding of adsorbates will result in a gain in energy of the system."
[3] "As a consequence, for bimetallic systems, an enrichment at the surface of the component that binds a certain adsorbate more strongly may occur."
[4] "We use this process to modify an un-leached, carbon-supported Pt3Co alloy high-surface-area catalyst (HSAC) to increase the utilization of platinum in the particles."
[5] "For HSAC catalysts, however, this is generally more complicated."
[6] "To determine the surface condition of the catalyst nanoparticles we used cyclic voltammetry in alkaline electrolyte (Figure1a)."
[7] "Moreover, for the CO-annealed catalyst, the additional oxidation peak at low potentials (0.4VRHE) in the CO-stripping curves (Figure1b), which is an unambiguous sign of Co surface atoms, is not present anymore."
[8] "The coreshell nanoparticles were also investigated as possible catalyst candidates for oxygen reduction (ORR), which is a key reaction in fuel-cell technology."
[9] "Studies on polycrystalline and single-crystal model systems have shown that alloying Pt with a first-row transition metal leads to an increase in specific activity by a factor of 24."
[10] "In acid electrolyte the CO-annealed Pt3Co catalyst also shows superior activity; compared to plain Pt HSAC the specific activity increased by a factor of 3 (Figure2)."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods aim to achieve coreshell structures with an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell. However, they have significant disadvantages, such as loss in active surface area and material, formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation.

2. The CO-annealing treatment modifies the surface composition of carbon-supported Pt3Co catalyst particles by causing platinum atoms to segregate to the particle surface. This results in the formation of nanoparticles with a platinum shell surrounding an alloy core. This modification leads to a superior activity in the oxygen reduction reaction compared to both a plain platinum catalyst and the untreated alloy particles.

1. 支持双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属材料的化学浸出和电沉积技术。这些方法旨在实现具有非贵金属核心和贵金属壳层的核壳结构。然而，它们存在显著缺点，如活性表面面积和材料的损失、非贵金属壳层形成不完全以及在准备过程中需要控制电压。

2. CO退火处理通过使铂原子向粒子表面聚集，改变了碳支持的Pt3Co催化剂颗粒的表面组成。这导致形成了具有铂壳包裹合金核心的纳米颗粒。这种修改使得氧还原反应的活性优于纯铂催化剂和未处理的合金颗粒。
