The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include thermal evaporation-impregnation, co-precipitation, and electrodeposition. Thermal evaporation-impregnation involves depositing one metal on a support material and then impregnating it with another metal. Co-precipitation involves the simultaneous precipitation of both metals from a single solution. Electrodeposition utilizes an electric current to deposit metals onto a substrate. These methods have their own potential advantages, such as control over particle size and shape, ease of scale-up, and compatibility with various materials. In terms of applications, they can be used in various industrial processes, including chemical synthesis, energy conversion, and environmental remediation. Overall efficacy depends on factors such as the specific reaction conditions, metal composition, and support material.
