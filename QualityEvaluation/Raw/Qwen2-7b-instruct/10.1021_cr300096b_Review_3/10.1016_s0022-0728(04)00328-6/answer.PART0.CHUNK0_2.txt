1. Commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include chemical reduction, hydrolysis, vacuum deposition, and colloidal methods. These methods vary in their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Chemical reduction and hydrolysis can be effective but may not consistently achieve the desired alloy composition. Vacuum deposition allows precise control over the composition and size of the nanoparticles, while colloidal methods offer ease of synthesis but might struggle with achieving a consistent alloy composition across the prepared nanoparticles.

2. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are chemical reduction, hydrolysis, vacuum deposition, and colloidal methods. These methods differ in their ability to control composition and size, with vacuum deposition offering the most precise control. However, they all face challenges in achieving a consistent alloy composition across the synthesized nanoparticles.
