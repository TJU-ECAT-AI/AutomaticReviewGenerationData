[1] "Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition."
[2] "An attempt has been made to study the optimum PtCo composition for formic acid oxidation using nanoparticles electrochemically deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite."
[3] "Syntheses of nanoparticles with controlled size are therefore of great interest."
[4] "The ultimate metal composition in the nanoparticles follows that in the precursor solution, without loss in control of the particle size."
[5] "The PtCo nanoparticles were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements on several different regions (with analytical areas down to 100 nm in diameter) of each sample of the unsupported PtCo nanoparticles."
[6] "The 1:0.5 atomic ratio of Pt:Co alloy provides the best activity of the different Pt/Co compositions prepared with the same Pt loading."
[7] "In the light of the bi-functional mechanism, Pt and its electronic character will affect mostly the CH cleavage occurring at a low overpotential. The role of Co or its oxides is likely to play the role of OHad and contribute to the removal of CO at higher potentials."
