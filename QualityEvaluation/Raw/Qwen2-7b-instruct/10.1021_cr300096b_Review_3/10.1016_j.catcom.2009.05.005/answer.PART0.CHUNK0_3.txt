[1] "The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase."
[2] "The systems most commonly used are Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3."
[3] "One of the main problems in the application of Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural is the often observed side reactions (hydrogenolysis of the CO bond, decarbonylation, hydrogenation and furan ring opening, etc.)."
[4] "In this regard, modifying the base catalyst, either by adding a more electropositive metal (Fe, Ga, Sn), by deposition of Pt on some partially reducible oxides (TiO2, ZrO2), or by controlling the size of Pt crystals, has been reported as giving good results in increasing the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol."
[5] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include adding a more electropositive metal (such as Fe, Ga, Sn) to the base catalyst, depositing Pt onto partially reducible oxides (like TiO2, ZrO2), or controlling the size of Pt crystals. These methods aim to enhance catalyst selectivity and efficiency. For instance, adding Sn to Pt-based systems has proven effective in increasing the efficiency of catalysts used in the hydrogenation of various unsaturated carbonyl compounds, including furfural. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts leads to better performance in hydrogenation reactions, particularly in the production of furfuryl alcohol.

常用的双金属催化剂合成方法包括向基催化剂中添加更正电性的金属（如Fe、Ga、Sn），在部分还原氧化物（如TiO2、ZrO2）上沉积Pt，或控制Pt晶粒大小。这些方法旨在提高催化剂的选择性和效率。例如，在Pt基系统中加入Sn可以有效提高各种不饱和羰基化合物（如糠醛）氢化反应的效率。添加Sn到Pt催化剂中能显著提升其在制备糠醇方面的性能。
