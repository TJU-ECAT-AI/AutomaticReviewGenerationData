<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve controlled surface reactions. In this context, the bimetallic PtSn catalysts were synthesized using techniques derived from Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M). These methods allow for precise control over the composition and structure of the catalysts, leading to improved activity and selectivity in catalytic reactions.
