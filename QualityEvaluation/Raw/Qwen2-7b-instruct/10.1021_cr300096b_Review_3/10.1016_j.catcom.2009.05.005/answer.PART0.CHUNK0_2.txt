[1] "Hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase."
[2] "The industrial process is conducted at high temperature and pressure, employing a CuCr catalyst, which exhibits a moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol."
[3] "With this type of catalyst, Vannice et al. found that the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol over copper chromite pretreated at 573 K was 70% for 64% of furfural converted."
[4] "In this regard, modifying the base catalyst, either by adding a more electropositive metal (Fe, Ga, Sn), by deposition of Pt on some partially reducible oxides (TiO2, ZrO2), or by controlling the size of Pt crystals, has been reported as giving good results in increasing the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol."
[5] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve modifying the base catalyst by adding more electropositive metals such as Fe, Ga, Sn, depositing Pt on partially reducible oxides like TiO2 or ZrO2, or controlling the size of Pt crystals. These methods aim to enhance the selectivity towards furfuryl alcohol in the hydrogenation of furfural.

常用的复合金属催化剂合成方法包括通过添加更正电性的金属（如Fe、Ga、Sn）修改基催化剂，将Pt沉积在部分可还原氧化物（如TiO2或ZrO2）上，或者控制Pt晶粒大小。这些方法旨在提高在糠醛氢化反应中选择性生成糠醇的能力。
