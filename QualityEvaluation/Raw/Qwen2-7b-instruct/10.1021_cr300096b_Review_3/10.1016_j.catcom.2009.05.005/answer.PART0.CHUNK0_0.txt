[1] "The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase."
[2] "One of the main problems in the application of Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural is the often observed side reactions (hydrogenolysis of the CO bond, decarbonylation, hydrogenation and furan ring opening, etc.)."
[3] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds."
[4] "The systems most commonly used are Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3."
[5] "The main drawback of this system is the toxicity of the catalyst, due to the presence of Cr2O3, which may have important consequences for the environment."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve controlled surface reactions, specifically derived from the Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) technique. This method allows for the selective deposition of metals onto the support surface, creating well-defined bimetallic phases.

2. The main advantages of these synthesis methods include the ability to control the composition and structure of the catalysts, leading to improved activity and selectivity. They offer the potential for high stability and the possibility to reuse the catalysts, which is particularly beneficial for industrial applications. However, the methods also face challenges such as the potential for side reactions and deactivation over multiple cycles.

3. The addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt)-based systems significantly improves the efficiency of catalysts used in the hydrogenation of various unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This enhancement is attributed to the modification of the electronic properties of the Pt sites, which promotes better hydrogenation rates.

4. Among the most commonly employed bimetallic systems are Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3. These systems are favored for their ease of preparation and stability, but they may exhibit limitations in terms of selectivity and environmental impact due to the presence of toxic components like chromium (Cr).

5. The toxicity of the catalyst, particularly due to the presence of chromium (Cr2O3), poses significant environmental concerns. This drawback limits the widespread adoption of certain catalysts in industrial processes, necessitating the development of alternative, safer materials.

1. 合成双金属催化剂的最常用方法是受控表面反应，特别是从表面有机金属化学在金属（SOMC/M）技术衍生而来的方法。这种方法允许将金属选择性地沉积到支持表面上，形成定义明确的双金属相。

2. 这些合成方法的主要优势包括能够控制催化剂的组成和结构，从而提高活性和选择性。它们为实现高稳定性和催化剂的可重复使用提供了可能，这对工业应用特别有益。然而，这些方法也面临着可能的副反应和多次循环后的失活等挑战。

3. 将锡（Sn）添加到铂（Pt）-基系统中显著提高了用于氢化各种不饱和羰基化合物的催化剂的效率。这种增强归因于对Pt位点电子性质的修改，促进了更好的氢化速率。

4. 最常使用的双金属系统包括Pt/C和Pt/Al2O3。这些系统由于其简便的制备方法和稳定性而受到青睐，但它们可能在选择性和环境影响方面存在局限，特别是由于存在有毒成分如铬（Cr2O3）。

5. 催化剂的毒性，尤其是由于存在铬（Cr），对环境构成了重大问题。这一缺点限制了某些催化剂在工业过程中的广泛应用，需要开发替代的、更安全的材料。
