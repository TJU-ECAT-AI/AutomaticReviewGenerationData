[1] "A series of silica-supported platinum and PtM (M = Au or Cu) catalysts was prepared to study the effects of added metal and precursor type on catalyst activity, selectivity, and structure."
[2] "All catalysts used in this study (Pt, Pt and Cu from inorganic salts, Pt and Cu from the Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8 cluster, and Pt and Au from the Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 cluster) contained 0.15 wt% Pt on silica."
[3] "The addition of Cu (either via coimpregnation or via the bimetallic cluster) does not appear to have any significant effect on the deactivation properties of Pt in these catalysts."
[4] "The DRIFTS spectrum of carbon monoxide adsorbed to this catalyst contains a very broad and asymmetric peak associated with CO bound to Pt."
[5] "Both of the cluster-derived catalysts have very similar light hydrocarbon distribution patterns and favor internal rather than terminal bond scission."

1. A series of platinum and bimetallic catalysts with gold or copper were synthesized to investigate the impact of metal addition and precursor type on catalyst performance, structure, and selectivity. 

2. All catalysts utilized in this research contained 0.15% platinum on silica.

3. Incorporating copper, either through coimpregnation or utilizing the bimetallic cluster, seems to not significantly affect the deactivation characteristics of platinum in these catalysts.

4. The infrared spectrum of carbon monoxide bound to the catalyst displays a broad and asymmetric peak attributed to CO bonded to platinum.

5. The two cluster-derived catalysts exhibit identical patterns of light hydrocarbon production and tend towards internal bond cleavage rather than terminal bond cleavage.

1. 本系列研究了一系列铂和双金属催化剂，其中包含金或铜，以探究添加金属和前体类型对催化剂活性、结构和选择性的影响。

2. 所有在本研究中使用的催化剂均含有0.15%的铂。

3. 在这些催化剂中，通过共浸渍或使用双金属簇引入铜似乎不会显著影响铂的失活特性。

4. 碳氧化合物吸附到催化剂上的红外光谱显示了一个宽广且不对称的峰，归因于与铂结合的CO。

5. 这两个簇衍生的催化剂显示出相似的轻烃生成模式，并倾向于内部键断裂而不是末端键断裂。
