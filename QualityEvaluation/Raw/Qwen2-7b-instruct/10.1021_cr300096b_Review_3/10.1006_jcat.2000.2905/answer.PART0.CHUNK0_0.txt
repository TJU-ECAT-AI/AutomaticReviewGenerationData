[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."
[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."
[3] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution (14), particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions."
[4] "Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst (13)."
[5] "Unfortunately, there are few bimetallic PtM clusters that are ligated exclusively by CO and carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable."
[6] "There are many molecular PtM clusters stabilized by phosphine ligands (26, 27); however, previous studies using phosphine-stabilized PtAu clusters as catalyst precursors indicated that that the presence of phosphine residues controls the properties of the resulting catalysts (28–32)."
[7] "In the current study, we extend this research to include the analogous PtCu cluster, Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support, followed by an activation step, usually reduction. A common issue with coimpregnation techniques is the potential separation of precursor ions as they traverse the support's pore structure. While some methods offer control over metal particle sizes and distributions, the overall surface composition can still vary widely. Clustering of one metal on the surface can lead to diverse active sites across the catalyst. There are few bimetallic PtM clusters ligated exclusively by CO, and no carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are available. Phosphine-stabilized PtAu clusters have been studied, but the presence of phosphine residues affects the catalyst properties. This research extends to include the PtCu cluster, Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8, and additional data for the Pt and cluster-derived PtAu catalysts are provided for comparison.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括将单金属前体吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀到载体上，随后进行活化步骤，通常是还原。共浸渍技术常见的问题是，作为它们通过支撑结构孔隙的前体离子可能分离。虽然一些方法可以控制金属颗粒大小和分布，但总体表面组成仍然可能有很大差异。表面金属的聚集体可能导致催化剂中颗粒的多种活性位点。几乎没有仅由CO配体连接的PtM双金属簇，也没有可用的碳氧配体连接的PtCu簇。使用磷配体稳定化的PtAu簇已被研究，但磷配体的存在影响了催化剂的性质。这项研究扩展到了包括Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8簇，并提供了Pt和簇衍生的PtAu催化剂的额外数据以进行比较。
