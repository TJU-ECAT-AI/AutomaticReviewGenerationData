[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."
[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."
[3] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering (13)."
[4] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distribution (14), particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide-ranging distributions."
[5] "Even when overall surface compositions are relatively homogeneous, varying degrees of clustering of one metal on the surface can produce numerous types of active sites on particles throughout the catalyst (13)."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support, followed by an activation step, typically reduction.

2. A common issue encountered with coimpregnation techniques is the separation of precursor ions as they traverse the support's pore structure.

3. High-temperature reduction or annealing can form a more homogeneous alloy, but this process carries the risk of excessive sintering.

4. Some techniques permit some control over metal particle sizes and distributions, but the compositions and surface compositions of the metals can exhibit a wide range of variations.

5. Even with relatively homogeneous overall surface compositions, different degrees of metal clustering on the surface can create diverse active sites across the catalyst particles.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的最常用方法包括吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀单金属前体到载体上，随后进行活化步骤，通常是还原。

2. 共浸渍技术常见的问题是，在通过载体孔结构时，前体离子会发生色谱分离。

3. 高温还原或退火可以形成更均匀的合金，但存在过度烧结的风险。

4. 一些技术允许一定程度的控制金属颗粒大小和分布，但金属的组成和表面组成可能表现出广泛的差异。

5. 即使表面组成相对均匀，表面上不同程度的金属聚集体也可能在催化剂颗粒中产生多种活性位点。
