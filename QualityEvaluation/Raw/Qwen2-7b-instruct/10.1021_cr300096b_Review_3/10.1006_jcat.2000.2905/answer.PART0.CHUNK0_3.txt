1. A variety of silica-supported platinum and PtM (M = Au or Cu) catalysts were synthesized to investigate the impact of added metal and precursor type on catalyst activity, selectivity, and structure.

2. TEM images for the 0.15-Pt and 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts were extensively discussed in a previous study (34).

3. Efforts to directly assess metal particle size for the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts via TEM failed, as particles were too minute to visualize at 300K× magnification.

4. The DRIFTS data did not allow for conclusions regarding electronic or geometric effects of Cu on Pt.

5. The 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst demonstrated significantly higher light hydrocarbon production compared to other catalysts in the study.

6. The 0.15-Pt2Cu4 and 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalysts showed comparable light hydrocarbon distributions, suggesting similar activity profiles.

7. Overnight catalysis run results for 0.15-Pt and the cluster-derived catalysts are illustrated in Figure 9.

8. The enhanced resistance to deactivation observed in the cluster-derived catalysts seems inherent to Au or the PtAu particles.

1. 研究了一系列由二氧化硅支持的铂和PtM（M = Au或Cu）催化剂，以研究添加金属和前体类型对催化剂活性、选择性和结构的影响。

2. 对于0.15-Pt和0.15-Pt2Au4催化剂的TEM图像在先前的研究中进行了详细介绍（34）。

3. 尝试通过TEM直接评估0.15-Pt2Cu4催化剂的金属颗粒尺寸失败，因为即使是在支撑材料的最薄部分也难以成像小于300K×放大倍数的颗粒。

4. DRIFTS数据未能提供关于Cu对Pt的电子或几何效应的结论。

5. 与任何其他催化剂相比，0.15-Pt2Cu4催化剂的轻烃产量高出一倍多。

6. 0.15-Pt2Cu4和0.15-Pt2Au4催化剂的轻烃分布相似，表明它们具有相似的活性特性。

7. 图9展示了0.15-Pt和簇衍生催化剂的过夜催化运行结果。

8. 簇衍生催化剂表现出的增强的抗失活性似乎是由Au或PtAu颗粒的内在性质决定的。
