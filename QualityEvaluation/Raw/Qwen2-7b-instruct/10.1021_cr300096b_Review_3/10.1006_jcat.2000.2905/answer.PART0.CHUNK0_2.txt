1. Almost universally, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are synthesized using a process that involves the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto a support, followed by an activation phase, typically reduction.

2. There are very few bimetallic PtM clusters that are exclusively bound by CO ligands, and carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are not available.

3. The current study expands on previous research to include the analogous PtCu cluster, Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8.

4. Catalyst activation, chemisorption measurements, and catalytic examinations were performed using an RXM-100 catalyst characterization system acquired from Advanced Scientific Designs, Inc.

5. Incorporating Cu (either through coimpregnation or using a bimetallic cluster) does not seem to significantly impact the deactivation characteristics of Pt in these catalysts.

1. 在几乎所有情况下，支持的双金属合金催化剂都是通过将单金属前体吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀到载体上，然后进行激活步骤（通常是还原）来合成的。

2. 很少有仅由CO配体连接的双金属PtM簇，而且无法获得碳氧基化PtCu簇。

3. 当前的研究扩展了先前的研究，包括与Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8等效的PtCu簇。

4. 催化剂的激活、化学吸附测量和催化研究是在从Advanced Scientific Designs，Inc.购买的RXM-100催化剂表征系统中进行的。

5. 通过共浸渍或使用双金属簇添加Cu，并不会显著影响Pt在这些催化剂中的降解特性。
