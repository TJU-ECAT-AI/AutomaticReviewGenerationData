Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 for citral hydrogenation: II. Catalytic properties Abstract Bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction (catalytic reduction method) were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral. Samples were reduced either at 300 C or at 500 C (SMSI effect). For both Rh and Pt series, the unsaturated alcohols (UA) selectivity goes through an optimum as a function of the germanium content whatever the reduction temperature. For low Ge loadings, it was possible to combine the bimetallic and SMSI effects, inducing a high UA selectivity on bimetallic catalysts supported on TiO2. On the other hand, at high Ge loadings the bimetallic effect was predominant and led also to a high UA selectivity. Moreover, TiO2 support contributed to stabilize the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction toward an air exposure at ambient temperature.
1. Introduction
Several studies have been made for developing suitable catalytic systems able to selectively hydrogenate α-,β-unsaturated aldehydes into unsaturated alcohols (UA). The selectivity to UA is highly dependant on the nature of the precious metal used as a catalyst. Monometallic catalysts of both Rh and Pt supported on alumina or silica generally revealed a poor selectivity to UA. However, addition of different modifiers (Sn, Ge, ) on these monometallic systems allowed one to improve the selective hydrogenation of CO bond [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] . In previous works, we have prepared bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts by surface redox reaction for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols [5] ,[6] . The catalyst supports used were alumina and silica. The addition of germanium to rhodium catalysts effectively improved the reaction selectivity towards UA. This effect was more obvious on alumina-supported catalysts on which the UA selectivity reached a maximum near 75% in isopropanol as solvent. However, the air exposure at ambient temperature of these bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts resulted in an irreversible modification of the metallic phase which induced a drop in their catalytic properties for citral hydrogenation [6] ,[7] .
The purpose of the present work was to extend our previous studies to another support, the titania oxide. In fact, this reducible support that presents the strong metalsupport interaction effect (SMSI effect) has been successfully used with monometallic catalysts (Pt based generally) to increase the selectivity to the CO group hydrogenation of various unsaturated aldehydes [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] . Moreover, several authors have observed a promoting effect of the modification of Pt, Ir or Ru monometallic catalysts supported on TiO2 by Fe, Ge or Sn for the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (citral, cinnamaldehyde and crotonaldehyde specially) [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] . On these bimetallic catalysts prepared by coimpregnation or successive impregnation, it was proposed that the presence of ionic species, such as promoters (Feδ+, Geδ+, ) or species generated upon reduction at high temperature of the reducible TiO2 support (i.e., TiO(2x) moieties) led to catalysts highly selective for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond. A cumulative effect of the titania support with the promoter was proposed in some cases.
In this paper, bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction were tested in selective hydrogenation of citral with the aim of combining the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The preparation of the various catalysts (parent monometallic, blank and bimetallic) is described in details in part I of this work [22] .
2.2. Temperature-programmed reduction
The TPR experiments were done with a 1.0 vol.% H2/argon gas mixture. The temperature range was 25500 C with a ramp of 5 C/min. The hydrogen uptake was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. The TPR were conducted on bimetallic catalysts dried at 100 C under hydrogen after their preparation by catalytic reduction, or treated at 100 C under hydrogen after an air exposure, and then transferred to the TPR reactor under inert atmosphere in order to avoid the oxidation by air.
2.3. Citral hydrogenation
The liquid phase hydrogenation of citral was carried out in a 300 mL stirred autoclave (Autoclave Engineers, fitted with a system for liquid sampling) at 70 C and at constant pressure of 7 MPa. Prereduced catalysts (400 mg) were immersed into 90 mL of solvent (isopropanol 99%) without exposure to air before introduction into the autoclave. After a first flush with nitrogen and a second with hydrogen, the temperature was raised to 70 C under 3 MPa of hydrogen. Then a mixture of substrate (3 mL of citral) and of isopropanol (10 mL) was loaded into the autoclave through a cylinder under a 7 MPa hydrogen pressure. Zero time was taken at this moment and stirring was switched on.
Liquid samples were analysed by gas chromatography on a Thermofinnigan chromatograph provided with a FID detector and a capillary column DB-WAX (J&W, 30 m, 0.53 mm i.d.) using nitrogen as carrier gas.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 presents the main reaction pathways that can occur during citral hydrogenation. The reduction of citral can lead to a variety of products. A first step is the reduction of either the CO or the conjugated CC bond to produce geraniol and nerol, referred as unsaturated alcohols (UA), or citronellal, respectively. Consecutive hydrogenation leads to citronellol and finally to 3,7-dimethyloctanol. Apart from these reactions, secondary processes of cyclization or of reaction with the solvent (alcohol) can lead to other by-products like isopulegols or acetals, respectively.

Preliminary runs carried out at different stirring conditions, loadings and catalyst grain sizes have demonstrated the absence of external and internal diffusional limitations.
3.1. Citral hydrogenation over parent monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts
In order to study the influence of the reducible support, the two parent monometallic 1 wt% Rh/TiO2 and 1 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalysts were reduced under hydrogen at 300 C or at 500 C after the calcination step, then tested in citral hydrogenation at 70 C with isopropanol as solvent. Catalysts activated following the above temperatures are denoted in this manuscript as Rh(3 0 0), Pt(3 0 0) and Rh(5 0 0), Pt(5 0 0), respectively. The catalytic properties for the parent Rh and Pt monometallic catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The citral conversion is given for a 15-min reaction time and the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (UA) is reported at 60% citral conversion. For both Rh and Pt catalysts, increasing the reduction temperature from 300 to 500 C leads to a small decrease of the citral conversion, while the UA selectivity is improved. This decrease of activity, in term of conversion, with an increase of the UA selectivity in the course of citral hydrogenation were also observed on Ru/TiO2 reduced at 500 C [21] . Nevertheless, the SMSI effect can induce in some cases an increase of both the selectivity and the conversion as observed with Pt/TiO2 for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation [8] . The promoting effect on the selectivity results from the creation of TiO(2x) partially reduced species of the support at 500 C, which would activate the electronic doublet of oxygen of the carbonyl function and thus would enhance its hydrogenation to the detriment of the conjugated CC bond hydrogenation [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[19] ,[23] ,[24] . Moreover, it can be noticed that the increase of UA selectivity induced by reduction at 500 C is more pronounced with Pt (20% for Pt(3 0 0) versus 38% for Pt(5 0 0)) than with Rh (9% for Rh(3 0 0) versus 22% for Rh(5 0 0)) parent catalysts. In other words, the SMSI effect is higher on Pt than on Rh samples. Same conclusion was drawn from cyclohexane dehydrogenation activities reported in the precedent work [22] . According to Herrmann, the sensitivity to the SMSI varies with the nature of the metal in the order Pt > Rh and is explained for Rh by a greater number of unfilled d-orbitals per metal atom [25] .

Fig. 2 presents a typical temporal concentration profiles of the reactant and the main products during citral hydrogenation on the Rh(5 0 0) parent catalyst. It should be pointed out that once the citral conversion reaches 100%, the UA keep being hydrogenated. This result indicates that the presence of TiO(2x) species does not poison the CC hydrogenation sites, but modifies the CC/CO adsorption competition.

3.2. Influence of Ge addition on Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts
In order to improve the unsaturated alcohol selectivity, the monometallic Rh(3 0 0), Rh(5 0 0), Pt(3 0 0) and Pt(5 0 0) catalysts were modified by addition of various amounts of germanium. The germanium deposit was introduced by catalytic reduction on the parent catalysts (see part I of this work for details) [22] . Previous work carried out on Rh-Ge catalysts prepared by catalytic reduction and supported on alumina or silica, showed that air exposure of these bimetallic systems induced a very marked inhibiting effect on their properties towards the citral hydrogenation [6] . Consequently, bimetallic catalysts were transferred under inert atmosphere towards the autoclave after preparation and activation by reduction (in situ conditions). Nevertheless, the effect of the exposure to air is presented further on in this paper.
Fig. 3 displays the citral conversion after 15 min reaction time of bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 ( Fig. 3 a) and Pt-Ge/TiO2 ( Fig. 3 b) catalysts as a function of the germanium content. After Ge deposition by catalytic reduction, each bimetallic sample was reduced under hydrogen at the temperature applied to the monometallic parent (300 or 500 C). For example, the bimetallic Rh(3 0 0)-Ge/TiO2 catalysts reduced at 300 C will be denoted [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]300 in this manuscript. The same kind of code name is used for the other sets. For each series, the value reported for %Ge equal to 0 corresponds to that of the blank sample. Blank Rh and Pt catalysts were prepared following the catalytic reduction procedure but the germanium salt was replaced by a hydrochloric solution of the same pH, that is pH 1 [5] ,[22] . The blank samples were reduced under hydrogen at the temperature applied to the monometallic parent (300 or 500 C).
Table 1 indicates that both Rh(3 0 0) blank and Pt(3 0 0) blank show the same performances than their parent monometallic counterparts. This result confirms that the blank treatment of the monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts does not lead to a sintering of metal particles as already noticed in the precedent work [22] . Likewise, the Pt(5 0 0) parent and Pt(5 0 0) blank show the same catalytic properties, while those of the Rh(5 0 0) blank and the Rh(5 0 0) parent are different. In this latter case, a drop of the citral conversion in parallel with an increase of the UA selectivity is observed after the blank treatment in comparison with the parent catalyst. A growth of the Rh particle size in the course of the blank treatment (immersion in an aqueous solution followed by a direct reduction under hydrogen) could explain these evolutions. Indeed, it has been shown that the selectivity to UA increases with increasing the metallic particle size of the catalyst for selective hydrogenation of different unsaturated aldehydes. For examples, this effect was observed for Pt on various supports [11] ,[26] ,[27] and for Ir and Os supported on titania [28] ,[29] ,[30] . For our systems, the hypothesis of an increase of the particle size can be discarded since we have reported in Part I of this work that the sizes of the particles for the parent and the blank were comparable for a same metal [22] .

On the other hand, the different behaviours in citral hydrogenation (Pt(5 0 0) blank Pt(5 0 0) parent while Rh(5 0 0) blank Rh(5 0 0) parent) observed for Pt and Rh are in accordance with the results previously obtained for the cyclohexane dehydrogenation study [22] . Indeed, in part I of this work, this model reaction allowed one to conclude that the Rh(5 0 0) blank possesses more TiO(2x) species than the Rh(5 0 0) parent whereas the Pt(5 0 0) blank and Pt(5 0 0) parent samples present the same amount of suboxides. Then, the higher UA selectivity of the Rh(5 0 0) blank is explained by the presence of more TiO(2x) moieties in comparison with its Rh(5 0 0) parent catalyst.On the [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]300 set, the germanium addition inhibits the hydrogenating activity but the conversion goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content ( Fig. 3 a). In the case of the [Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]500 series, the citral conversion increases up to 0.8 wt% deposited Ge, then decreases. Finally, for the two series of catalysts, the most loaded germanium samples present the lowest hydrogenating activities. The germanium deposition on Pt(3 0 0)/TiO2 induces first a slight increase of the citral conversion and then a decrease beyond 0.2 wt% Ge ( Fig. 3 b). Thus, the conversion drops near 10% for the [Pt(3 0 0)-1.1 wt% Ge]300 sample. For the [Pt(5 0 0)-Ge]500 series, the conversion drastically decreases above 0.2 wt% Ge, then tends towards a plateau near 10%.It should be pointed out that for both reduction temperatures (300 and 500 C) the shape of the conversion curves are different for Rh and Pt based catalysts ( Fig. 3 a and b, respectively). The Pt-Ge/TiO2 samples present similar evolutions than Fe-Ir/TiO2 catalysts reported in the literature [20] . In brief, in the catalysts reduced at low temperature the additive leads to an increase of the conversion until a maximum and then to a decrease for higher additive loading. Conversely, the conversion obtained for the series reduced at high temperature decreases continuously with the modifier addition. On the other hand, the evolutions observed for the Rh-Ge/TiO2 catalysts for both reduction temperatures are still similar to those obtained for Rh-Ge/SiO2 and Rh-Ge/Al2O3 which imply an optimum of conversion as function of Ge content [2] ,[5] ,[6] . The low SMSI effect observed on Rh/TiO2 catalyst in comparison with Pt/TiO2 or Ir/TiO2 could explain their different behaviours observed for the hydrogenation of citral once modified by an additive [19] ,[25] .
Finally, whatever the nature of the metal (Rh or Pt), for a same Ge content, the citral conversion is lower after reduction at 500 C than at 300 C. This phenomenon does not result from a variation of the metal particle sizes, since the TEM study showed comparable sizes for catalysts reduced at 300 and 500 C [22] . This behaviour results from the presence of TiO(2x) species which cover a part of the Rh or Pt surface after a reduction at 500 C. Consequently, the same inhibiting effect of Ge after a reduction at 500 C appears for lower Ge content in comparison with their counterparts reduced at 300 C. Otherwise, a change of the reduction degree of germanium in contact with rhodium after reduction at 500 C could also contribute to this phenomenon.
After reduction at 300 C, the evolutions of the selectivities for unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol), citronellal and citronellol are reported in Fig. 4 a and b as a function of the germanium content for Rh(3 0 0)-Ge and Pt(3 0 0)-Ge series, respectively. The UA selectivity increases with the germanium content, then reaches a maximum and finally decreases for the highest contents. An opposite behaviour is observed for the citronellol and citronellal selectivities. These evolutions as a function of the Ge content are similar to those previously observed for Rh-Ge/SiO2 and Rh-Ge/Al2O3 catalysts reduced at 300 C [2] ,[5] ,[6] . Moreover, the decrease of UA selectivities at high Ge contents does not result from citronellal formation, but from the appearance of secondary products.

Product's selectivities at 60% citral conversion as a function of Ge content for: (a) [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]3 0 0 and (b) [Pt(3 0 0)-Ge]300 bimetallic catalysts: () unsaturated alcohols; () citronellal; () citronellol (in dotted lines: selectivity for citral conversion lower than 60%).The comparison of the UA selectivities obtained after reduction at 300 and 500 C are given in Fig. 5 a and b for Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge series, respectively. It is clear, for both cases, that the same UA selectivity is obtained for lower Ge content for samples reduced at 500 C. This result is not surprising since TiO(2x) species reduced at 500 C participate also to the activation of the CO bond. For low Ge contents, it is thus possible to add the bimetallic (Ge oxidized species) and SMSI effects (TiO(2x) species) for the Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts in accordance with previous work on Ru-Sn/TiO2 [21] . For higher Ge contents (1.3 wt%Ge for Rh and 0.5 wt%Ge for Pt) there is no more beneficial effect from the SMSI induced by reduction at 500 C.Download: Download full-size image Fig. 5.

On the other hand, in the case of Pt based catalysts, it is obtained after reduction at 500 C ([Pt(5 0 0)-0.4 wt% Ge]500, S = 90%).
3.3. Influence of the reduction temperature of the bimetallic catalysts
3.3.1. Bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts
The results presented above related to Rh(3 0 0)-Ge and Rh(5 0 0)-Ge catalysts prepared by catalytic reduction and in situ reduced at 300 and 500 C, respectively, as their monometallic parent catalyst. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of the reduction temperature at the end of the preparation of these two series of bimetallic systems: Rh(3 0 0)-Ge were reduced at 500 C in order to induce a reducible support effect, while Rh(5 0 0)-Ge were reduced at 300 C to limit this effect.
3.3.1.1. Bimetallic Rh(3 0 0)-Ge
Fig. 6 defers the citral conversions after 15 min reaction time and the UA selectivities of Rh(3 0 0)-Ge and Rh(5 0 0)-Ge systems following the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C) and the Ge content. For the blank Rh(3 0 0)/TiO2 catalyst (%Ge = 0), an increase of the reduction temperature from 300 to 500 C induces a decrease of the citral conversion from 74% to 49%, and on the other hand, an increase of the UA selectivity from 10% to approximately 20%. The catalytic performances of the blank Rh(3 0 0) reduced at 500 C are located between those of the blank Rh(3 0 0) reduced at 300 C and the blank Rh(5 0 0) reduced at 500 C. This phenomenon cannot be explained by evolutions of the metal particle sizes since all the Rh-Ge/TiO2 samples have average particle diameters ranging between 2.0 and 3.0 nm whatever the reduction temperature (see part I of this work) [22] . The fact that Rh(3 0 0) blank reduced at 500 C is less active and more selective than after a reduction at 300 C can be explained by the occurrence of the SMSI effect after the final reduction at 500 C. Nevertheless, it is more active and less selective than the Rh(5 0 0) blank reduced at 500 C which would then possess more TiO(2x) species. Effectively, it was demonstrated in Part I of this work that the blank treatment destroys only a part of the TiO(2x) species of support on catalysts initially reduced at 500 C [22] . Then, in the case of Rh samples, a new reduction at 500 C at the end of the treatment would create other TiO(2x) species which migrate on metal surface, beside those already existing. In this case, the SMSI effect can thus be enhanced to some extent with a new reduction at high temperature.

(a) Citral conversion after 15 min reaction time and (b) unsaturated alcohols selectivity at 60% citral conversion as a function of Ge content for Rh-Ge bimetallic catalysts: () [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]300; () [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]5 0 0; () [Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]500; () [Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]300 (in dotted lines: selectivity for citral conversion lower than 60%).Concerning the bimetallic [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]500 catalysts, whatever the Ge content, the citral conversions ( Fig. 6 a) are close to those obtained for [Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]500. On the other hand, increasing the reduction temperature to 500 C of the Rh(3 0 0)-Ge catalysts surprisingly does not improve the UA selectivity for low Ge contents (1 wt%). This result can be explained by both: (i) the presence of Ge on rhodium for the Rh(3 0 0)-Ge set which would partially hinder the formation of TiO(2x) species developed by reduction at 500 C as proposed for the Ru-Sn/TiO2 system [21] , (ii) a more reduced state of the Ge in contact with Rh after reduction at 500 C whereas according to the literature an oxidized form of Ge would be the promoter site for activation of CO [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[31] . For a high Ge content (1.6 wt%), the increase of reduction temperature from 300 C ([Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]3 0 0) to 500 C ([Rh(3 0 0)Ge]500] leads even to a less selective catalyst for UA production.
3.3.1.2. Bimetallic Rh(5 0 0)-Ge
The bimetallic [Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]300 catalysts keep almost the same hydrogenating activity than after a reduction at 500 C ([Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]500) ( Fig. 6 a). In terms of UA selectivity, a decrease of the final reduction (300 C versus 500 C) leads to a loss of the properties ( Fig. 6 b).
In summary, for Ge contents 1 wt% the two sets of catalysts [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]500 and [Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]300 are less selective than the [Rh(5 0 0)-Ge]500 systems. This indicates that two subsequent reductions at 500 C (parent and bimetallic) are necessary to increase the amount of TiO(2x) species and thus to combine the support and the bimetallic effects.
For Ge contents >1 wt%, a reduction at 500 C either of the parent or/and the bimetallic catalysts leads to a loss of UA selectivity compared to that obtained for [Rh(3 0 0)-Ge]300. The bimetallic effect is then predominant at high Ge loadings.
3.3.2. Bimetallic Pt-Ge catalysts
On the [Pt(5 0 0)-Ge]500 series, the UA selectivity is pretty high (8090%) in the 0.20.4 wt% Ge range ( Fig. 5 b). In that case the two promoter effects (bimetallic and SMSI) cumulate. However, the citral conversions of these systems are rather low. With the aim of enhancing catalyst activity, the bimetallic Pt(5 0 0)-Ge/TiO2 catalysts were reduced at only 300 C, thus decreasing the reducible support effect. As shown in Fig. 7 a and b, the performances of the [Pt(5 0 0)-Ge]300 systems in terms of conversion and UA selectivity are intermediary between those of the [Pt(5 0 0)-Ge]500 and [Pt(3 0 0)-Ge]300 sets. These results can be explained by a memory effect of the reduction of the parent catalyst at 500 C. Indeed, it was observed in part I of this paper that some TiO(2x) species formed by reduction at 500 C of the parent catalyst remain on the metallic surface after immersion in water and subsequent reduction at 300 C [22] .

3.4. Influence of air exposure of bimetallic catalysts
A former study carried out on Rh-Ge catalysts prepared by catalytic reduction and supported on alumina or silica, showed that air exposure of these bimetallic systems leads to an irreversible modification of their surface state [6] ,[7] . Then, bimetallic catalysts were transferred under inert atmosphere towards the autoclave at the end of their preparation. Nevertheless, in the present work it was interesting to study the impact of air exposure on the catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalysts supported on the reducible TiO2 support. In that way, the reduced bimetallic samples were exposed to air at ambient temperature during one night, then reduced again under hydrogen before their in situ transfer towards the autoclave. The catalytic properties of selected Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge bimetallic samples submitted to this treatment are reported in Table 2 .

For example, for the Rh(3 0 0)-1.6 wt%Ge and Rh(3 0 0)-1.8 wt% Ge systems, the air exposure involves a higher citral conversion after reduction at 300 C, in agreement with the shape of the citral conversion curve as a function of Ge content ( Fig. 3 a). Indeed, in Fig. 3 a, in the range 11.8 wt%Ge, the citral conversion is all the more high as the Ge content is low. Likewise, concerning the UA selectivity, after exposure to air, the Rh(3 0 0)-1.6 wt% Ge catalyst presents a small decrease whereas a slight increase is observed for the Rh(3 0 0)-1.8 wt% Ge sample. These observations are still in agreement with the evolution of the UA selectivity curve in Fig. 5 a. Indeed, in Fig. 5 a, the in situ Rh(3 0 0)-1.6 wt% Ge showing the best selectivity, the air exposure induces inevitably a decrease of the UA selectivity. On the other hand, the Rh(3 0 0)-1.8 wt% Ge being after the optimum, an air exposure involves an increase of the UA selectivity.
In the case of the Pt-Ge/TiO2 samples, the comparison of Table 2 and Fig. 3 , Fig. 5 leads to the same conclusion, i.e., an air exposure induces the behaviour of a catalyst with a lower Ge content.All these results can be explained by a segregation of Ge from the bimetallic particles on the catalysts after air exposure. Nevertheless, this segregation must be rather small as indicated by the TPR profiles of the in situ and exposed to air Rh(3 0 0)-1.8 wt%Ge bimetallic catalyst ( Fig. 8 ). The TPR measurements were performed following the protocol described in Section 1 . As reported in part I of this work, the main peak around 200250 C corresponds to the reduction of partially oxidized Ge species close to Rh particles [22] . It can be seen in Fig. 8 that the air exposure treatment induces a small increase of this peak. On the other hand, by comparison with previous work on Rh-Ge/Al2O3 [6] , the air exposure does not increase the H2 consumption near 500 C corresponding to oxidized Ge species isolated on the support. Thus, it can be concluded that the TiO2 support contributes to stabilize the bimetallic particles prepared by catalytic reduction.

4. Conclusions
Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide, prepared by the catalytic reduction method, were reduced either at 300 C or at 500 C (SMSI effect). All these systems were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral.
The addition of germanium- to titania-supported 1 wt% Rh or 1 wt% Pt catalysts strongly modified their catalytic properties. For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C). At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined. In this case, both oxidized Ge and TiO(2x) species participate to the activation of the CO bond. On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C. The bimetallic effect is then predominant at high Ge loadings. As a consequence, for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C), the optimum for the UA selectivity was obtained at lower germanium contents compared to their counterparts reduced at 300 C.
Moreover, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support.
