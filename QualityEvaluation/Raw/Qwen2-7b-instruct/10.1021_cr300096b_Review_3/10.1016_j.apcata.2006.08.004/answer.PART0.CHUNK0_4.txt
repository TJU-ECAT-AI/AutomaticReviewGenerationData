[1] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 for citral hydrogenation: II. Catalytic properties Abstract Bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction (catalytic reduction method) were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral."
[2] "Samples were reduced either at 300 C or at 500 C (SMSI effect)."
[3] "For both Rh and Pt series, the unsaturated alcohols (UA) selectivity goes through an optimum as a function of the germanium content whatever the reduction temperature."
[4] "At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined."
[5] "On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C."
[6] "As a consequence, for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C), the optimum for the UA selectivity was obtained at lower germanium contents compared to their counterparts reduced at 300 C."
[7] "Moreover, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve surface redox reactions, specifically catalytic reduction methods. These methods are advantageous due to their ability to prepare catalysts with desired properties, such as enhanced selectivity for specific reactions, and they are applicable for various types of reactions including hydrogenation processes.

2. The potential advantages of using TiO2 as a support material for bimetallic catalysts include its strong metalsupport interaction effect (SMSI effect), which can increase the selectivity for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. Additionally, TiO2 provides stability to the bimetallic particles prepared via catalytic reduction, unlike supports such as alumina or silica.

3. The synthesis methods allow for the tuning of catalyst properties by controlling parameters such as the reduction temperature, germanium content, and the type of metal used. This flexibility enables the optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions, such as the selective hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols (UA).

4. The stability of the bimetallic particles prepared on TiO2 support is noteworthy, particularly when compared to those prepared on supports like alumina or silica. This stability is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity over multiple reaction cycles, which is essential for industrial applications where prolonged use is required.

5. The synthesis methods allow for the combination of the bimetallic effect (enhanced catalytic activity due to the synergistic interaction between two metals) and the SMSI effect (increased reactivity of the metal surface due to the interaction with the support) to achieve optimal catalytic performance. This synergy is particularly evident when optimizing the germanium content and reduction temperature for the highest UA selectivity.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的最常用方法是表面氧化还原反应，特别是催化还原法。这些方法的优势在于能够准备具有所需特性的催化剂，如特定反应的选择性增强，并适用于各种反应，包括氢化过程。

2. 使用TiO2作为支持材料制备双金属催化剂的潜在优势包括其强金属-支撑相互作用效应（SMSI效应），可以增加不饱和醛的氢化选择性。此外，TiO2对通过催化还原法制备的双金属颗粒提供了稳定性，而与其他支持材料如氧化铝或硅胶相比。

3. 合成方法允许通过控制参数如还原温度、锗含量和所用金属类型来调整催化剂特性。这种灵活性使优化催化剂性能以适应特定反应成为可能，例如选择性氢化柠檬醛为不饱和醇。

4. 与在氧化铝或硅胶上制备的颗粒相比，TiO2支持的双金属颗粒的稳定性值得注意。这种稳定性对于维持多次反应周期中的催化活性至关重要，这是工业应用中需要的。

5. 合成方法允许结合双金属效应（由于两种金属之间的协同作用而增强的催化活性）和SMSI效应（由于与支撑物的相互作用导致金属表面活性增强）以实现最佳催化性能。这种协同作用特别明显，当优化锗含量和还原温度以获得最高不饱和醇选择性时。
