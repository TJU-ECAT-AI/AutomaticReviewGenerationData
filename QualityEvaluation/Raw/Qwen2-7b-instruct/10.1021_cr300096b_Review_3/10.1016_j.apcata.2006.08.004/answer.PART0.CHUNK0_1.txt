[2] "The addition of germanium- to titania-supported 1 wt% Rh or 1 wt% Pt catalysts strongly modified their catalytic properties."
[3] "For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C)."
[4] "At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined."
[5] "On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C."
[6] "The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve catalytic reduction, as demonstrated by the preparation of Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts on TiO2. These methods offer advantages such as precise control over particle size and morphology, leading to potentially superior catalytic performance compared to conventional impregnation methods.

2. The potential advantages of the catalytic reduction method include better dispersion of metal particles, enhanced stability, and improved activity and selectivity. The application of this method is widespread across various industries, including petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals, due to its ability to tailor catalyst properties for specific reaction conditions.

3. In terms of overall efficacy, the catalytic reduction method has proven effective in synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts with tailored properties for a wide range of reactions. This is evidenced by the ability to achieve high selectivities, such as the optimal UA selectivity observed in the citral hydrogenation process discussed.

4. The method allows for the combination of the bimetallic effect and the SMSI effect, as demonstrated by the enhancement of UA selectivity when germanium is added to the catalysts. The reduction temperature plays a crucial role in determining the balance between these effects, with higher temperatures favoring the SMSI effect at lower germanium contents and the bimetallic effect at higher contents.

5. The stability of the bimetallic particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 is noteworthy, as it contrasts with the findings on alumina or silica supports. This stability suggests that the reducible TiO2 support contributes to the stabilization of the bimetallic particles, which may be attributed to the strong metal-support interaction effect (SMSI).

6. The method offers a high degree of control over the synthesis process, allowing for the optimization of catalyst properties for specific applications. This controllability is evident in the ability to adjust germanium content and reduction temperature to achieve desired catalytic outcomes, such as the maximum UA selectivity observed in the study.

1. 常用的合成双金属催化剂支持的方法是催化还原，如在TiO2上制备Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂。这些方法的优点包括对颗粒大小和形态的精确控制，这可能比传统浸渍方法提供更好的催化性能。

2. 催化还原方法的优势包括更均匀的金属颗粒分散、增强的稳定性以及改善的活性和选择性。这种方法在石油化学、制药和精细化学品等领域广泛应用，因为它能够根据特定的反应条件定制催化剂特性。

3. 总体而言，催化还原方法在合成具有特定性质的支持双金属催化剂方面非常有效。这从在讨论中观察到的高选择性（如在柠檬醛氢化过程中获得的最佳不饱和醇选择性）中得到证明。

4. 该方法允许结合双金属效应和SMSI效应，如通过添加锗到催化剂中增强不饱和醇的选择性所显示的那样。降低温度对于确定这些效应之间的平衡至关重要，更高温度有利于在较低锗含量下促进SMSI效应，在较高含量下则有利于双金属效应。

5. 与氧化铝或硅胶相比，TiO2支持的双金属粒子的稳定性值得赞扬。这可能是由于TiO2支持的强金属-支持相互作用效应（SMSI）导致的稳定化，这表明TiO2支持对双金属粒子具有贡献。

6. 该方法提供了高度的合成过程可控性，允许优化催化剂特性以满足特定应用需求。这种可控性体现在能够调整锗含量和降低温度以实现所需的催化结果，如观察到的最大不饱和醇选择性。
