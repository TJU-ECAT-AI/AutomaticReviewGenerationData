<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The synthesis methods most commonly utilized for supported bimetallic catalysts in this document are the catalytic reduction method. These methods involve reducing the catalysts either at 300 C or at 500 C. The potential advantages of these methods include the ability to combine the bimetallic effect with the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect. Applications include the selective hydrogenation of citral, where the catalysts can exhibit high selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. Overall efficacy is notable, especially when germanium is added to the catalysts, leading to optimized selectivity depending on the reduction temperature and germanium content.

本文中用于支持双金属催化剂合成的主要方法是催化还原法。这些方法包括在300°C或500°C下还原催化剂。这些方法的优势在于能够结合双金属效应和强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）效应。应用包括选择性氢化柠檬醛，其中催化剂可以表现出高选择性饱和醇。总的来说，该方法的有效性很高，尤其是当向催化剂添加锗时，可以根据还原温度和锗含量优化选择性。
