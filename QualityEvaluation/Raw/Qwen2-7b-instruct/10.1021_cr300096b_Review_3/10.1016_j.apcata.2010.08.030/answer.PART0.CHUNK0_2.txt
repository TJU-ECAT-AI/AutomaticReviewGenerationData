[1] "The most active catalyst coating, designated COAT-1Pt2Co, could decrease CO concentrations from 1% to a value of less than 10 ppm for GHSV values ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1."
[2] "Experimental results showed that the addition of Co improves catalytic activity. This improvement is partly related to the formation of Pt3Co, coinciding with an increase in the average particle size."
[3] "The co-existence of Co metal and its oxides on the catalyst surface were revealed to be a consequence of the gradual oxidation of Co by the gas phase O2 during the initial stages of the PROX reaction."
[4] "This synergetic effect of Co0 and Cox+ may be yet another reason for the superior activities of PtCo catalysts."
[5] "The high accessibility of the reactant to Pt3Co species is favorable and crucial for PROX."

1. The most active catalyst coating, COAT-1Pt2Co, could reduce carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations from 1% to less than 10 ppm across a wide range of gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1.

2. The addition of cobalt (Co) to the catalyst improved its activity, which was partly attributed to the formation of Pt3Co intermetallic compounds, leading to an increase in the average particle size.

3. The presence of both Co metal and its oxides on the catalyst surface resulted from the gradual oxidation of Co by gas phase oxygen during the initial stages of the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (PROX) reaction.

4. The synergistic effect between Co0 and Cox+ might contribute to the enhanced activity of PtCo catalysts.

5. The high availability of reactants to Pt3Co species is advantageous and essential for the PROX reaction.

1. 最具活性的催化剂涂层COAT-1Pt2Co可以在从40,000到120,000ml/g/h的广泛的气体小时空间速度（GHSV）范围内，将二氧化碳（CO）浓度从1%降低至少于10ppm。

2. 添加钴（Co）提高了催化剂的活性，这主要与形成Pt3Co互金属化合物以及平均粒子大小的增加有关。

3. 铜金属和其氧化物的存在是由于在PROX反应的初始阶段，气体相氧逐渐氧化铜的结果。

4. Co0和Cox+的协同效应可能是PtCo催化剂活性更高的另一个原因。

5. 反应物对Pt3Co物种的高度可接近性对于PROX反应是有利且至关重要的。
