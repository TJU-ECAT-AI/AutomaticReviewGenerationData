1. The most active catalyst coating, COAT-1Pt2Co, can reduce CO concentrations from 1% to less than 10 ppm across a wide range of gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1. 
2. This catalyst works effectively across a broad temperature range.
3. Adding cobalt enhances the catalytic activity.
4. The improved activity is linked to the formation of a Pt3Co intermetallic compound, leading to an increase in the average particle size.
5. The presence of both metallic cobalt and its oxides on the catalyst surface is due to the cobalt's gradual oxidation by gas-phase oxygen during the initial PROX reaction phase.

1. 最活跃的催化剂涂层COAT-1Pt2Co可以在从40,000到120,000ml/g1/h1的宽范围气小时空间速度（GHSV）下，将CO浓度从1%降低至少于10ppm。
2. 这种催化剂在较宽的温度范围内工作有效。
3. 添加钴可以增强催化活性。
4. 活动性的提高与形成Pt3Co互金属化合物有关，导致平均颗粒尺寸的增加。
5. 随着气体相氧在初始PROX反应阶段对钴的逐渐氧化，表面同时存在金属钴及其氧化物。
