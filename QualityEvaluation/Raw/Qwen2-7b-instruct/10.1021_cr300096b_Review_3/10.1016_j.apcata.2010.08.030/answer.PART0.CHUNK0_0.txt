1. Supported noble metals like platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), ruthenium (Ru), gold (Au), rhodium (Rh), and iridium (Ir) are commonly used in the development of PROX catalysts. Among these, platinum-based catalysts are of particular interest due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. The preference for Pt-based catalysts in PROX applications stems from their superior performance compared to other noble metals.

3. Cobalt (Co) is the most frequently used promoter in Pt-based catalysts because it enhances the catalytic activity of PROX reactions.

4. There are multiple methods available for carbon monoxide (CO) removal from hydrogen-rich gas streams, including cryogenic separation, pressure swing adsorption, selective diffusion, preferential oxidation of CO (PROX), and CO methanation.

5. The PROX reaction demands a catalyst that is active, selective, and stable.

6. A PtCo catalyst is anticipated to excel in PROX reactions due to the superior performance of PtCo catalysts in comparison to other Pt-based catalysts.

7. The incorporation of Co results in the formation of Pt3Co intermetallic compounds, leading to a slight increase in the average particle size of the catalyst.

8. The promotional impact of Co in PROX is substantiated by the formation of the Pt3Co intermetallic compound and the synergistic effect of Co0 and Cox+.

9. The high availability of reactants to Pt3Co species is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of the PROX reaction.

10. The objective is to develop a low-loading Pt catalyst capable of reducing CO concentrations in hydrogen-rich gas streams to low parts per million (ppm) levels at low temperatures and high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV).
