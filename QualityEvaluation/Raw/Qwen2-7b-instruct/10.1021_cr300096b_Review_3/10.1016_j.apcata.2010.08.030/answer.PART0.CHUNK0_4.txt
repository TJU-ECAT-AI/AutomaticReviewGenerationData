<p>The synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts typically involves impregnation methods, where a metal salt solution is added to a support material, followed by drying and calcination. This approach allows for the precise control of metal loading and distribution.</p>
<p>This study investigated the catalytic properties of PtCo catalyst coatings for preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (PROX) reactions in hydrogen-rich gas streams. An active catalyst coating was obtained at lower temperatures with lower Pt loading. The most active catalyst coating, designated COAT-1Pt2Co, could decrease CO concentrations from 1% to a value of less than 10 ppm for GHSV values ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1. This catalyst coating can work at a wide window of operation in terms of temperature.</p>
<p>Experimental results showed that the addition of Co improves catalytic activity. This improvement is partly related to the formation of Pt3Co, coinciding with an increase in the average particle size. The co-existence of Co metal and its oxides on the catalyst surface were revealed to be a consequence of the gradual oxidation of Co by the gas phase O2 during the initial stages of the PROX reaction.</p>

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts are often synthesized through impregnation methods, which enable precise control over metal loading and distribution.
2. The most active catalyst coating in this study, COAT-1Pt2Co, was able to reduce CO concentrations to less than 10 ppm across a range of GHSV values from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g1 h1.
3. The addition of Co to the catalyst coating enhances its activity, partly due to the formation of Pt3Co, which correlates with an increase in the average particle size.
4. The co-existence of Co metal and its oxides on the catalyst surface emerges from the initial oxidation of Co by gas phase O2 during the PROX reaction.

1. 支持型双金属催化剂通常通过浸渍法合成，这种方法允许精确控制金属负载和分布。
2. 在这项研究中，活性最高的催化剂涂层COAT-1Pt2Co能够在40,000到120,000 ml g1 h1的GHSV范围内将CO浓度降低至少于10 ppm。
3. 添加Co到催化剂涂层中提高了其活性，部分原因是形成了Pt3Co，这与平均颗粒尺寸的增加相吻合。
4. 在初始的PROX反应阶段，Co金属和其氧化物在催化剂表面共存，这是由气体相O2对Co的氧化作用导致的。
