1. The most active catalyst coating, named COAT-1Pt2Co, can reduce carbon monoxide concentrations from 1% to below 10 ppm across a wide range of gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) from 40,000 to 120,000 ml g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. It operates effectively within a broad temperature range.
2. The coexistence of cobalt metal and its oxides on the catalyst surface emerges as a result of cobalt gradually oxidizing by gas-phase oxygen during the initial stages of the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide (PROX) reaction.
3. The synergistic interaction between Co0 (zero-valent cobalt) and Cox+ (cobalt oxides) could contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity of PtCo catalysts.
4. The high availability of the reactant to Pt3Co species is advantageous and essential for the PROX reaction.

1. 最具活性的催化剂涂层，命名为COAT-1Pt2Co，可以在40,000到120,000 ml g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>的气相小时空间速度范围内，将一氧化碳浓度从1%降低至少于10 ppm。它在较宽的温度范围内有效运行。
2. 在选择性氧化碳（PROX）反应的初期阶段，气体相氧逐渐氧化钴，导致催化剂表面存在钴金属和其氧化物的共存。
3. 零价钴（Co0）与Cox+（钴氧化物）之间的协同作用可能是铂钴催化剂活性较高的另一个原因。
4. 反应物对Pt3Co物种的高可接近性对于PROX反应是有利且至关重要的。
