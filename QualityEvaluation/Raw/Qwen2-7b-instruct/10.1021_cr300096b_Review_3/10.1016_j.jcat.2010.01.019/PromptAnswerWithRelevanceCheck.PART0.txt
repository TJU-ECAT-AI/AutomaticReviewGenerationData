<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the work presented in this paper is to correlate the effects of Pt:Ni atomic ratio and impregnation sequence with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation and with the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</p>

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are incipient wetness impregnation, co-impregnation, and sequential impregnation. These methods compare in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Incipient wetness impregnation allows for precise control over metal loading but can lead to uneven metal distribution. Co-impregnation ensures better mixing of metals but might result in higher costs. Sequential impregnation is simpler and less expensive but may not achieve optimal metal dispersion.

The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically involve incipient wetness impregnation, which is effective for loading metals onto supports. The comparison between methods such as sequential impregnation and co-impregnation indicates that co-impregnation tends to yield the highest activity due to better mixing of metal atoms. The hydrogenation activity of these catalysts is influenced by the metal atomic ratio, with higher Ni loadings leading to increased activity. Furthermore, the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation correlates with the catalytic performance, as indicated by the coordination numbers obtained from EXAFS measurements. The FTIR studies reveal that Pt atoms reside on the surface of the bimetallic nanoparticles, and their segregation during reduction is consistent with previous findings on the thermodynamic stability of Pt-terminated surfaces in reducing environments.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法，通常采用浸渍湿法，这种方法适用于将金属负载到支撑材料上。对顺序浸渍和共浸渍等方法的比较表明，共浸渍方法倾向于产生最高活性，因为可以更好地混合金属原子。这些催化剂的氢化活性受金属原子比的影响，更高的镍负载量导致活性增加。此外，通过EXAFS测量获得的PtNi双金属键形成程度与催化性能相关，表现为配合数。FTIR研究表明，Pt原子位于双金属纳米粒子的表面，并且在高温下其可以进行迁移，这与之前关于在还原环境中Pt终止表面热力学稳定性的研究结果一致。

[1] "Several parallels between model surfaces and supported catalysts can be drawn based on the results presented above."
[2] "First, in the study of model Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, it was found that Pt atoms would segregate to the surface under reduction conditions."
[3] "Recent XPS studies on both polycrystalline Ni/Pt films and on supported Pt/Ni nanoparticles have also shown that Pt resides on the surface after reduction in H2."
[4] "Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(1 1 1) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or the PtNi(1 1 1) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal."
[5] "The PtPt interatomic distances obtained through EXAFS fitting suggest that Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are in a strained state."
[6] "As Pt:Ni ratio is increased from 1:1 to 1:10, the PtPt interatomic distance decreases from 2.73 Å to 2.69 Å."
[7] "This work clearly shows that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds."
[8] "It was found that hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading."
[9] "Similarly, it was found that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity in comparison with either sequentially impregnated catalyst."
[10] "Hydrogenation activity was also seen to correlate to PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements."

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts can be synthesized using various methods, including incipient wetness impregnation. These methods offer advantages such as precise control over metal loading and particle size. Sequential impregnation allows for adjustment of the metal atomic ratio, whereas co-impregnation facilitates better mixing of metals before fixation to the support, potentially enhancing activity.

2. The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts can vary widely depending on the specific requirements of the catalyst and the application. They typically involve impregnating a support material with metal precursors. The choice of method can impact the catalyst's performance, as each technique influences the distribution and interaction of metals. For instance, sequential impregnation may lead to different activity patterns compared to co-impregnation, as seen in this study.

3. The results indicate that increasing Ni loading enhances the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts, suggesting that the extent of bimetallic bond formation plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's efficiency. Furthermore, co-impregnation results in the highest activity, highlighting the importance of effective metal mixing before fixation to the support.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve sequential impregnation and co-impregnation. Sequential impregnation involves adding one metal precursor to the support followed by drying and calcination, then repeating the process with the second metal. Co-impregnation involves adding both metal precursors simultaneously. The potential advantages of sequential impregnation include precise control over the metal loading, while co-impregnation can lead to more uniform metal distribution and potentially better catalytic performance due to better mixing of the metals before fixation to the support. Applications of these methods are widespread in the production of various types of catalysts, particularly in industries requiring high selectivity and activity, such as petrochemical processing. Overall efficacy depends on the specific catalyst system and reaction conditions.

Answer: The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically include sequential impregnation and co-impregnation. Sequential impregnation offers precise control over metal loading, whereas co-impregnation can enhance catalyst performance through better metal mixing and distribution. These methods are widely applicable in petrochemical industries for catalysts requiring high selectivity and activity.
