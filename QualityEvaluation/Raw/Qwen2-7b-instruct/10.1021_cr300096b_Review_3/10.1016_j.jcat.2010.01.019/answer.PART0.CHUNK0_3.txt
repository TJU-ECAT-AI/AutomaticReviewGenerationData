<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the work presented in this paper is to correlate the effects of Pt:Ni atomic ratio and impregnation sequence with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation and with the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</p>
<p>Benzene hydrogenation to cyclohexane is an important industrial reaction because it can be utilized to reduce the aromatic content of petroleum fuels.</p>
<p>A number of different transition metal-based catalysts such as Ni, Pt, Pd, Ru, Fe, and Co have been studied for use in benzene hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene serves as a means to purify the butene stream generated in the cracking of naphtha or gas oil.</p>
<p>In order to successfully polymerize butene, 1,3-butadiene must be removed, because even small amounts of 1,3-butadiene (up to 1%) are sufficient to poison the polymerization catalysts.</p>
<p>Pd supported on alumina has been reported as the most active and selective catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of dienes; however, some literature shows that Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit both high activity and selectivity to 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation.</p>

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve sequential impregnation and co-impregnation. Sequential impregnation involves adding one metal precursor to the support followed by drying and calcination, then repeating the process with the second metal. Co-impregnation involves adding both metal precursors simultaneously. The potential advantages of sequential impregnation include precise control over the metal loading, while co-impregnation can lead to more uniform metal distribution and potentially better catalytic performance due to better mixing of the metals before fixation to the support. Applications of these methods are widespread in the production of various types of catalysts, particularly in industries requiring high selectivity and activity, such as petrochemical processing. Overall efficacy depends on the specific catalyst system and reaction conditions.

Answer: The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically include sequential impregnation and co-impregnation. Sequential impregnation offers precise control over metal loading, whereas co-impregnation can enhance catalyst performance through better metal mixing and distribution. These methods are widely applicable in petrochemical industries for catalysts requiring high selectivity and activity.
