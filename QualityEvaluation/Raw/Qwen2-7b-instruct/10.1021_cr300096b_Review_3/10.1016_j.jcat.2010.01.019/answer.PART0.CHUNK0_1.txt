The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically involve incipient wetness impregnation, which is effective for loading metals onto supports. The comparison between methods such as sequential impregnation and co-impregnation indicates that co-impregnation tends to yield the highest activity due to better mixing of metal atoms. The hydrogenation activity of these catalysts is influenced by the metal atomic ratio, with higher Ni loadings leading to increased activity. Furthermore, the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation correlates with the catalytic performance, as indicated by the coordination numbers obtained from EXAFS measurements. The FTIR studies reveal that Pt atoms reside on the surface of the bimetallic nanoparticles, and their segregation during reduction is consistent with previous findings on the thermodynamic stability of Pt-terminated surfaces in reducing environments.

对于支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法，通常采用浸渍湿法，这种方法适用于将金属负载到支撑材料上。对顺序浸渍和共浸渍等方法的比较表明，共浸渍方法倾向于产生最高活性，因为可以更好地混合金属原子。这些催化剂的氢化活性受金属原子比的影响，更高的镍负载量导致活性增加。此外，通过EXAFS测量获得的PtNi双金属键形成程度与催化性能相关，表现为配合数。FTIR研究表明，Pt原子位于双金属纳米粒子的表面，并且在高温下其可以进行迁移，这与之前关于在还原环境中Pt终止表面热力学稳定性的研究结果一致。
