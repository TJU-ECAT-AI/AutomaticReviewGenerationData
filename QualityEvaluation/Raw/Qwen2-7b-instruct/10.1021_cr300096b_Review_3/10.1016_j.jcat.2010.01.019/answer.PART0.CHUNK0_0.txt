<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the work presented in this paper is to correlate the effects of Pt:Ni atomic ratio and impregnation sequence with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation and with the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</p>

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are incipient wetness impregnation, co-impregnation, and sequential impregnation. These methods compare in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Incipient wetness impregnation allows for precise control over metal loading but can lead to uneven metal distribution. Co-impregnation ensures better mixing of metals but might result in higher costs. Sequential impregnation is simpler and less expensive but may not achieve optimal metal dispersion.

1. 支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法是浸渍湿法、共浸渍和顺序浸渍。这些方法在潜在优势、应用范围和总体生产效率方面进行比较。浸渍湿法允许对金属负载进行精确控制，但可能导致不均匀的金属分布。共浸渍确保了更好的金属混合，但可能会导致更高的成本。顺序浸渍更简单且成本更低，但可能无法实现最佳的金属分散。
