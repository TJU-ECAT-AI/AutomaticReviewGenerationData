[1] "Several parallels between model surfaces and supported catalysts can be drawn based on the results presented above."
[2] "First, in the study of model Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, it was found that Pt atoms would segregate to the surface under reduction conditions."
[3] "Recent XPS studies on both polycrystalline Ni/Pt films and on supported Pt/Ni nanoparticles have also shown that Pt resides on the surface after reduction in H2."
[4] "Studies on model bimetallic systems have also demonstrated that Pt-terminated surfaces, either the PtNiPt(1 1 1) prepared by deposition and subsequent diffusion of one monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or the PtNi(1 1 1) surface prepared by depositing ML Pt on Ni(1 1 1), lead to novel low-temperature hydrogenation because they bind hydrogen and alkenes more weakly than either parent metal."
[5] "The PtPt interatomic distances obtained through EXAFS fitting suggest that Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are in a strained state."
[6] "As Pt:Ni ratio is increased from 1:1 to 1:10, the PtPt interatomic distance decreases from 2.73 Å to 2.69 Å."
[7] "This work clearly shows that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds."
[8] "It was found that hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading."
[9] "Similarly, it was found that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity in comparison with either sequentially impregnated catalyst."
[10] "Hydrogenation activity was also seen to correlate to PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements."

1. Supported bimetallic catalysts can be synthesized using various methods, including incipient wetness impregnation. These methods offer advantages such as precise control over metal loading and particle size. Sequential impregnation allows for adjustment of the metal atomic ratio, whereas co-impregnation facilitates better mixing of metals before fixation to the support, potentially enhancing activity.

2. The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts can vary widely depending on the specific requirements of the catalyst and the application. They typically involve impregnating a support material with metal precursors. The choice of method can impact the catalyst's performance, as each technique influences the distribution and interaction of metals. For instance, sequential impregnation may lead to different activity patterns compared to co-impregnation, as seen in this study.

3. The results indicate that increasing Ni loading enhances the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts, suggesting that the extent of bimetallic bond formation plays a crucial role in determining the catalyst's efficiency. Furthermore, co-impregnation results in the highest activity, highlighting the importance of effective metal mixing before fixation to the support.

1. 支持型双金属催化剂可以通过多种方法合成，包括浸渍湿法。这些方法提供了控制金属负载和颗粒大小的优势。顺序浸渍允许调整金属原子比，而共浸渍则有助于在固定到载体之前更好地混合金属，可能增强活性。

2. 支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法可以有很大差异，具体取决于催化剂的具体要求和应用。它们通常涉及用金属前体浸渍支持材料。选择的方法会影响催化剂的性能，因为每种技术都会影响金属的分布和相互作用。例如，顺序浸渍可能导致与共浸渍不同的活性模式。

3. 结果表明，增加Ni加载可以增强催化剂的氢化活性，暗示双金属键形成的程度对催化剂效率起着关键作用。此外，共浸渍导致最高活性，强调了在固定到载体之前有效金属混合的重要性。
