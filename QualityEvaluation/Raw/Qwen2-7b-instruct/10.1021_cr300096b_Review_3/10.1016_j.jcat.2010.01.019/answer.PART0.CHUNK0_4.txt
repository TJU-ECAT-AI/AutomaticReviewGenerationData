<p>Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of metal atomic ratio and the other to study the effect of impregnation sequence.</p>
<p>In studying the effect of metal atomic ratio, it was found that hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading. Similarly, it was found that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity in comparison with either sequentially impregnated catalyst.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation activity was also seen to correlate to PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements.</p>

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve incipient wetness impregnation. This method allows for the precise control of metal loadings and the potential to synthesize catalysts with different metal atomic ratios and impregnation sequences. The synthesis of bimetallic catalysts through co-impregnation was found to yield the highest activity compared to sequentially impregnated catalysts. The hydrogenation activity of the catalysts correlates with the coordination numbers of Pt-Ni bonds obtained from EXAFS measurements. FTIR CO adsorption results indicate that Pt atoms tend to reside on the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles and can segregate during reduction, which is consistent with previous DFT modeling and surface science studies.

常用的合成方法是浸渍湿法，这允许对金属负载进行精确控制，并有可能合成具有不同金属原子比和浸渍顺序的催化剂。同时浸渍法合成的催化剂表现出最高的活性，与依次浸渍的催化剂相比。氢化活性与从EXAFS测量中获得的Pt-Ni键的配位数成正比。FTIR CO吸附结果表明，Pt原子倾向于位于双金属纳米粒子的表面上，并且可以在高温下发生再分布，这与之前的DFT建模和表面科学研究是一致的。
