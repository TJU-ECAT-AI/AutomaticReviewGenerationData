<p>The ammonia method of preparation leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports. Difficult for reduction cobalt silicate supported phases, besides Co3O4, are formed mostly on the SiO2.</p>
<p>The better performance in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation of the samples prepared by ammonia method is due to finely dispersed and easily reducible Co3O4.</p>
<p>Samples supported on SiO2 exhibit higher catalytic activity than that on kenyaite, probably due to the presence of easier reducible cobalt. The higher surface area of silica than that of kenyaite could also be important.</p>
<p>Addition of Pt improves the combustion activity and the promoting effect is more evident for the samples prepared by impregnation. This result can be explained by synergy effect of cobalt oxide species and Pt.</p>

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are the ammonia method and impregnation. The ammonia method results in the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4, while the impregnation method typically yields larger Co3O4 particles. The choice of support material, such as SiO2 or synthetic kenyaite, affects the particle size and reducibility of the cobalt oxide. Finely dispersed and easily reducible Co3O4 leads to higher catalytic activity in the complete benzene oxidation reaction. The addition of Pt enhances the activity, particularly when the catalyst is prepared through the impregnation method, due to a synergistic effect between the cobalt oxide species and the Pt. The presence of easier reducible cobalt, higher surface area, and strong interaction between cobalt oxide and Pt during preparation can impact the overall efficacy of the catalysts.

最常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法是氨法和浸渍法。氨法能形成细分散的Co3O4，而浸渍法则通常会产生较大的Co3O4颗粒。选择不同的支撑材料，如SiO2或合成肯尼亚特，会影响氧化钴的粒度和可还原性。细分散且容易还原的Co3O4在完全苯氧化反应中表现出更高的催化活性。添加Pt可以提高活性，尤其是当催化剂通过浸渍法制备时，由于Co氧化物种与Pt之间的协同效应。更容易还原的钴、更高的比表面积以及制备过程中Co氧化物与Pt之间的强相互作用，都会影响催化剂的整体效能。
