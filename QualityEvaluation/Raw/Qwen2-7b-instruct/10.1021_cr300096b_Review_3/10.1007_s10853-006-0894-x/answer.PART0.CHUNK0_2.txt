The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts in the literature are impregnation and the ammonia method. These methods differ in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. The impregnation method involves soaking the support material in a solution containing the desired metal salt, followed by drying and calcination. This method is effective for loading metals onto the support material and can result in the formation of larger metal particles. The ammonia method, on the other hand, involves dissolving the metal salt in water, boiling the solution to prevent oxidation, and then adding ammonia. This method leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxides on the support, often resulting in higher surface area and potentially more active catalysts due to the enhanced dispersion of the active phase.

SiO2 and synthetic kenyaite are the most frequently used supports in the production of the catalysts discussed in the document. SiO2 is favored for its higher surface area, which contributes to increased catalytic activity, while synthetic kenyaite provides a layered structure that can lead to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 particles through the ammonia method.

The ammonia method of preparation leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports, whereas cobalt silicate phases are formed predominantly on the SiO2 support. The better performance in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation for samples prepared via the ammonia method is attributed to the presence of finely dispersed and easily reducible Co3O4. The higher surface area of silica supports contributes to higher catalytic activity compared to those supported on kenyaite.

Adding Pt to the catalysts improves their combustion activity, particularly for samples prepared by the impregnation method. This enhancement is explained by the synergistic effect between the cobalt oxide species and Pt. However, the less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts prepared by the ammonia method on kenyaite support is attributed to the strong interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process, which results in decreased reducibility and accessibility of Pt.

文献中所采用的两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法和氨法。这两种方法在优势、应用范围以及整体生产效率方面存在差异。浸渍法通过将含有所需金属盐的溶液浸泡到支撑材料上，然后干燥和煅烧，从而有效地将金属负载到支撑材料上，并可能导致形成较大的金属颗粒。而氨法则是通过将金属盐溶解在水中，将水煮沸以防止氧化，然后添加氨。这种方法导致在支撑材料上形成细分散的金属氧化物，通常由于活性相的增强分散，可以产生更高表面面积和可能更高效的催化剂。

SiO2和合成肯尼亚石是文献中讨论的催化剂中最常使用的支撑材料。SiO2因其更高的比表面积，对提高催化活性有贡献，而合成肯尼亚石则提供了一种层状结构，通过氨法可导致形成细分散的Co3O4颗粒。

氨法制备导致在两种支撑材料上均形成细分散的Co3O4，而Co3O4硅酸盐相则主要在SiO2支撑上形成。对于通过氨法制备的催化剂，在反应中完全苯氧化性能较好的原因是存在细分散且易于还原的Co3O4。与kenyaite相比，SiO2支持的催化剂表现出更高的催化活性，这可能归因于存在更容易还原的钴。

添加Pt到催化剂中可以提高燃烧活性，尤其是对于通过浸渍法制备的样品。这种增强可以通过钴氧化物种与Pt之间的协同作用来解释。然而，通过氨法在kenyaite支撑上制备的双金属催化剂中，Pt的促进效果较弱，这是由于在制备过程中Co氧化相与Pt之间强烈的相互作用导致了Pt的可还原性和可达性降低。
