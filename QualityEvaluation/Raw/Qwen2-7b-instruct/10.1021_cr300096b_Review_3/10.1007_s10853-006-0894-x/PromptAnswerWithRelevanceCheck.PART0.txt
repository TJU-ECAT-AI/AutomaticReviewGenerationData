1. Two synthesis methods are commonly utilized for supported bimetallic catalysts: impregnation and the ammonia method. The impregnation method leads to the formation of larger cobalt oxide particles, whereas the ammonia method forms finely dispersed cobalt oxide. 
2. SiO2 and synthetic kenyaite are the most frequently used supports in this context. The ammonia method of preparation tends to produce more finely dispersed cobalt oxide particles, while the impregnation method forms larger cobalt oxide crystallites. 
3. The overall efficacy of the synthesis methods can vary based on the specific catalyst properties desired. Finely dispersed particles can offer enhanced reactivity and efficiency, while larger particles may require higher temperatures for reduction. The choice between the methods depends on the catalyst's intended application and the desired properties.

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are impregnation and ammonia methods. The impregnation method leads to the formation of larger Co3O4 crystallites, while the ammonia method results in finely dispersed Co3O4. The finely dispersed Co3O4 obtained through the ammonia method shows better performance in the complete benzene oxidation reaction compared to the impregnation method, despite having lower dispersion of Co3O4 based on XRD data. The ammonia method also tends to produce more easily reducible cobalt, which contributes to its enhanced activity.

2. The addition of Pt to cobalt catalysts improves their activity in the complete benzene oxidation reaction. This improvement is attributed to the synergy effect between cobalt oxide species and Pt. However, the promoting effect of Pt is more evident in catalysts prepared via the impregnation method, possibly due to the stronger interaction between cobalt oxide and Pt during the preparation process.

3. The less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of bimetallic Co + Pt/Ken-AM can be attributed to the lower Pt concentration in this sample and the strong interaction between Co oxide and Pt during the preparation process. This strong interaction might lead to a decreased accessibility and reducibility of platinum, resulting in a weaker promoting effect.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的主要方法是浸渍法和氨法。浸渍法导致较大的Co3O4晶体形成，而氨法产生细分散的Co3O4。通过氨法获得的细分散Co3O4在完全苯氧化反应中的表现更好，尽管根据XRD数据其Co3O4分散度较低。氨法也倾向于产生更易于还原的钴，这对其活性有贡献。

2. 钯添加到钴催化剂中可以提高其在完全苯氧化反应中的活性。这种改善归因于钴氧化物种与钯之间的协同作用。然而，在浸渍法制备的催化剂中，钯的促进效果更为明显，这可能是因为在制备过程中钴氧化物与钯之间较强的相互作用导致钯的可接近性和还原性降低，从而产生较弱的促进效果。

3. 钯在Co + Pt/Ken-AM双金属催化剂中的较弱催化活性效果可以归因于该样品中钯浓度较低以及在制备过程中钴氧化物与钯之间的强烈相互作用。这种强烈的相互作用可能导致钯的可接近性和还原性降低，从而产生较弱的促进效果。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts in the literature are impregnation and the ammonia method. These methods differ in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. The impregnation method involves soaking the support material in a solution containing the desired metal salt, followed by drying and calcination. This method is effective for loading metals onto the support material and can result in the formation of larger metal particles. The ammonia method, on the other hand, involves dissolving the metal salt in water, boiling the solution to prevent oxidation, and then adding ammonia. This method leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxides on the support, often resulting in higher surface area and potentially more active catalysts due to the enhanced dispersion of the active phase.

SiO2 and synthetic kenyaite are the most frequently used supports in the production of the catalysts discussed in the document. SiO2 is favored for its higher surface area, which contributes to increased catalytic activity, while synthetic kenyaite provides a layered structure that can lead to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 particles through the ammonia method.

The ammonia method of preparation leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports, whereas cobalt silicate phases are formed predominantly on the SiO2 support. The better performance in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation for samples prepared via the ammonia method is attributed to the presence of finely dispersed and easily reducible Co3O4. The higher surface area of silica supports contributes to higher catalytic activity compared to those supported on kenyaite.

Adding Pt to the catalysts improves their combustion activity, particularly for samples prepared by the impregnation method. This enhancement is explained by the synergistic effect between the cobalt oxide species and Pt. However, the less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts prepared by the ammonia method on kenyaite support is attributed to the strong interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process, which results in decreased reducibility and accessibility of Pt.

文献中所采用的两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法和氨法。这两种方法在优势、应用范围以及整体生产效率方面存在差异。浸渍法通过将含有所需金属盐的溶液浸泡到支撑材料上，然后干燥和煅烧，从而有效地将金属负载到支撑材料上，并可能导致形成较大的金属颗粒。而氨法则是通过将金属盐溶解在水中，将水煮沸以防止氧化，然后添加氨。这种方法导致在支撑材料上形成细分散的金属氧化物，通常由于活性相的增强分散，可以产生更高表面面积和可能更高效的催化剂。

SiO2和合成肯尼亚石是文献中讨论的催化剂中最常使用的支撑材料。SiO2因其更高的比表面积，对提高催化活性有贡献，而合成肯尼亚石则提供了一种层状结构，通过氨法可导致形成细分散的Co3O4颗粒。

氨法制备导致在两种支撑材料上均形成细分散的Co3O4，而Co3O4硅酸盐相则主要在SiO2支撑上形成。对于通过氨法制备的催化剂，在反应中完全苯氧化性能较好的原因是存在细分散且易于还原的Co3O4。与kenyaite相比，SiO2支持的催化剂表现出更高的催化活性，这可能归因于存在更容易还原的钴。

添加Pt到催化剂中可以提高燃烧活性，尤其是对于通过浸渍法制备的样品。这种增强可以通过钴氧化物种与Pt之间的协同作用来解释。然而，通过氨法在kenyaite支撑上制备的双金属催化剂中，Pt的促进效果较弱，这是由于在制备过程中Co氧化相与Pt之间强烈的相互作用导致了Pt的可还原性和可达性降低。

The ammonia method results in the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4, while the impregnation method typically yields larger Co3O4 particles.

Finely dispersed and easily reducible Co3O4 leads to higher catalytic activity in the complete benzene oxidation reaction. The addition of Pt enhances the activity, particularly when the catalyst is prepared through the impregnation method, due to a synergistic effect between the cobalt oxide species and the Pt.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts in this study are classical impregnation and the ammonia method. The classical impregnation method leads to the formation of relatively large Co3O4 crystallites, which are reduced at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the ammonia method produces finely dispersed Co3O4 particles. These particles are easier to reduce and lead to better performance in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation, despite having a lower dispersion as measured by XRD. The better performance of catalysts prepared via the ammonia method is attributed to the presence of more easily reducible cobalt. Additionally, the introduction of Pt improves the combustion activity of the catalysts, particularly for those prepared by the impregnation method. However, the effectiveness of Pt is reduced when it is added to bimetallic catalysts prepared by the ammonia method on the kenyaite support, likely due to a strong interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process.

本文研究中所采用的两种主要支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法是经典浸渍法和氨法。经典浸渍法导致形成相对较大的Co3O4晶粒，这些晶粒在较高温度下被还原。另一方面，氨法产生细分散的Co3O4颗粒。这些颗粒更易于还原，并且在完全苯氧化反应中表现出更好的性能，尽管根据XRD测量其分散度较低。氨法催化剂表现出更好的性能归因于更容易还原的钴的存在。此外，添加Pt可以提高燃烧活性，特别是对于通过浸渍法制备的催化剂。然而，在使用氨法制备并负载在肯尼亚石上的催化剂中添加Pt的效果较弱，这可能是由于在制备过程中Co氧化物与Pt之间强烈的相互作用导致铂浓度降低以及强相互作用造成的。
