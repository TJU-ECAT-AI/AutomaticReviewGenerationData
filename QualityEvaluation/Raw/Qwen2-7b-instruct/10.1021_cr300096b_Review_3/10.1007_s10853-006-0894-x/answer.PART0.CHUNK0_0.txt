1. Two synthesis methods are commonly utilized for supported bimetallic catalysts: impregnation and the ammonia method. The impregnation method leads to the formation of larger cobalt oxide particles, whereas the ammonia method forms finely dispersed cobalt oxide. 
2. SiO2 and synthetic kenyaite are the most frequently used supports in this context. The ammonia method of preparation tends to produce more finely dispersed cobalt oxide particles, while the impregnation method forms larger cobalt oxide crystallites. 
3. The overall efficacy of the synthesis methods can vary based on the specific catalyst properties desired. Finely dispersed particles can offer enhanced reactivity and efficiency, while larger particles may require higher temperatures for reduction. The choice between the methods depends on the catalyst's intended application and the desired properties.

1. 常用的两种制备双金属催化剂的方法是浸渍法和氨法。氨法导致在两种支持物上形成更细分散的钴氧化物，而浸渍法则形成较大的钴氧化物结晶体。
2. SiO2 和合成肯尼亚石是此上下文中最常使用的支持物。在准备过程中，氨法倾向于产生更细分散的钴氧化物颗粒，而浸渍法则形成较大的钴氧化物结晶体。
3. 合成方法的总体效果可能会根据所需催化剂属性的不同而有所不同。细分散的颗粒可以提供增强的反应性和效率，而较大的颗粒可能需要更高的温度进行还原。选择方法取决于催化剂的预期应用和所需的属性。
