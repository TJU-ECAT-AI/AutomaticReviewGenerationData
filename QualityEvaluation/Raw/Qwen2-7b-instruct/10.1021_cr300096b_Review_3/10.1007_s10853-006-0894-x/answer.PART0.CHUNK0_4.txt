<p>The ammonia method of preparation leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports.</p>
<p>The better performance in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation of the samples prepared by ammonia method on SiO2 than that of catalysts on kenyaite, in spite of the lower dispersion of Co3O4 calculated from XRD data (Table 1), is due to the presence of a part of cobalt that is easier reducible as it is found with TPR (the peaks at T < 600 K in Fig. 2 and the lack of such peaks with Co/Ken-AM [9]).</p>
<p>Cobalt loading by impregnation leads to the formation of large Co3O4 crystallites (13 nm, see Table 1), which are reduced at higher temperature.</p>
<p>Introduction of cobalt on both supports by impregnation leads to the formation of Co3O4 only.</p>
<p>Monometallic samples prepared by ammonia method are more active than impregnated one.</p>
<p>Addition of Pt to the cobalt catalysts improves their activity in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation. This result can be explained by synergy effect of cobalt oxide species and Pt.</p>
<p>As can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 6, platinum promotes in lower extent the ammonia prepared samples. One of the possible explanations can be a strong interaction between Pt and finely dispersed Co3O4 in these samples.</p>
<p>The less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of bimetallic Co + Pt/Ken-AM in the reaction of deep benzene oxidation can be attributed also to the lower Pt concentration in this sample and to the strong interaction between Co oxide and Pt during the preparation process.</p>

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts in this study are classical impregnation and the ammonia method. The classical impregnation method leads to the formation of relatively large Co3O4 crystallites, which are reduced at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the ammonia method produces finely dispersed Co3O4 particles. These particles are easier to reduce and lead to better performance in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation, despite having a lower dispersion as measured by XRD. The better performance of catalysts prepared via the ammonia method is attributed to the presence of more easily reducible cobalt. Additionally, the introduction of Pt improves the combustion activity of the catalysts, particularly for those prepared by the impregnation method. However, the effectiveness of Pt is reduced when it is added to bimetallic catalysts prepared by the ammonia method on the kenyaite support, likely due to a strong interaction between the Co oxide phase and Pt during the preparation process.

本文研究中所采用的两种主要支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法是经典浸渍法和氨法。经典浸渍法导致形成相对较大的Co3O4晶粒，这些晶粒在较高温度下被还原。另一方面，氨法产生细分散的Co3O4颗粒。这些颗粒更易于还原，并且在完全苯氧化反应中表现出更好的性能，尽管根据XRD测量其分散度较低。氨法催化剂表现出更好的性能归因于更容易还原的钴的存在。此外，添加Pt可以提高燃烧活性，特别是对于通过浸渍法制备的催化剂。然而，在使用氨法制备并负载在肯尼亚石上的催化剂中添加Pt的效果较弱，这可能是由于在制备过程中Co氧化物与Pt之间强烈的相互作用导致铂浓度降低以及强相互作用造成的。
