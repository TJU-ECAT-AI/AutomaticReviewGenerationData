<p>The ammonia method of preparation leads to the formation of finely dispersed Co3O4 on both supports.</p>
<p>The better performance in the reaction of complete benzene oxidation of the samples prepared by ammonia method on SiO2 than that of catalysts on kenyaite, in spite of the lower dispersion of Co3O4 calculated from XRD data (Table 1), is due to the presence of a part of cobalt that is easier reducible as it is found with TPR (the peaks at T < 600 K in Fig. 2 and the lack of such peaks with Co/Ken-AM [9]).</p>

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are impregnation and ammonia methods. The impregnation method leads to the formation of larger Co3O4 crystallites, while the ammonia method results in finely dispersed Co3O4. The finely dispersed Co3O4 obtained through the ammonia method shows better performance in the complete benzene oxidation reaction compared to the impregnation method, despite having lower dispersion of Co3O4 based on XRD data. The ammonia method also tends to produce more easily reducible cobalt, which contributes to its enhanced activity.

2. The addition of Pt to cobalt catalysts improves their activity in the complete benzene oxidation reaction. This improvement is attributed to the synergy effect between cobalt oxide species and Pt. However, the promoting effect of Pt is more evident in catalysts prepared via the impregnation method, possibly due to the stronger interaction between cobalt oxide and Pt during the preparation process.

3. The less promoting effect of Pt on the catalytic activity of bimetallic Co + Pt/Ken-AM can be attributed to the lower Pt concentration in this sample and the strong interaction between Co oxide and Pt during the preparation process. This strong interaction might lead to a decreased accessibility and reducibility of platinum, resulting in a weaker promoting effect.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的主要方法是浸渍法和氨法。浸渍法导致较大的Co3O4晶体形成，而氨法产生细分散的Co3O4。通过氨法获得的细分散Co3O4在完全苯氧化反应中的表现更好，尽管根据XRD数据其Co3O4分散度较低。氨法也倾向于产生更易于还原的钴，这对其活性有贡献。

2. 钯添加到钴催化剂中可以提高其在完全苯氧化反应中的活性。这种改善归因于钴氧化物种与钯之间的协同作用。然而，在浸渍法制备的催化剂中，钯的促进效果更为明显，这可能是因为在制备过程中钴氧化物与钯之间较强的相互作用导致钯的可接近性和还原性降低，从而产生较弱的促进效果。

3. 钯在Co + Pt/Ken-AM双金属催化剂中的较弱催化活性效果可以归因于该样品中钯浓度较低以及在制备过程中钴氧化物与钯之间的强烈相互作用。这种强烈的相互作用可能导致钯的可接近性和还原性降低，从而产生较弱的促进效果。
