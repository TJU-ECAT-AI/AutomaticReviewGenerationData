1. Among various hydrogen storage materials, ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) has attracted significant attention due to its high hydrogen content of 19.6 wt%. However, the high cost and scarcity of platinum limit its widespread use. 
2. It is noted that previously reported PteNi catalysts displayed relatively moderate performance.
3. The catalytic activities of the synthesized catalysts were examined for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB solution.
4. The hydrogen release rates initially rise and then decline as the Pt content grows, displaying a volcano-shaped pattern.
5. Compared to other noble metal catalysts, the apparent activation energies for the current catalysts are typically lower, indicating enhanced catalytic performance.
