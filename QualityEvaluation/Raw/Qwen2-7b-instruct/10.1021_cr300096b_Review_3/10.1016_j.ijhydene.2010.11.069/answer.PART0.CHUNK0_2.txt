1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant. These methods are advantageous due to their ability to control particle size and dispersion, leading to high catalytic activities in applications such as hydrogen generation from ammonia borane hydrolysis.

2. The polyol synthesis process, as mentioned in quote [2], involves mixing nickel acetate and sodium hydroxide with oleic acid in a deoxygenated ethylene glycol solution under an argon atmosphere. The solution is then heated to a specific temperature, allowing for the formation of nickel nanoparticles. The oleic acid acts as a surfactant, regulating the particle size and preventing agglomeration.

3. The core-shell nanostructured Ni1x@Ptx and Ni1x@Ptx/C (x = 0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) catalysts, synthesized via a surfactant-mediated polyol process, exhibit high catalytic activities for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, surpassing pure platinum and nickel catalysts in terms of efficiency and hydrogen generation rates.

4. In the context of quote [4], the presence of Ni1x@Ptx NPs significantly enhances the catalytic activity during the hydrolysis of ammonia borane compared to pure nickel nanoparticles, suggesting an improvement in hydrogen release kinetics.

5. According to quote [5], the incorporation of carbon support into the catalyst formulation (Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs) further improves the catalytic activity, likely due to enhanced stability, dispersion, and accessibility of the active sites on the metal nanoparticles.

6. The catalytic activities of the synthesized Ni1x@Ptx NPs with varying Pt contents are influenced by the elemental composition. As noted in quote [6], the activity trends demonstrate a volcano-shaped pattern, indicating that the optimal Pt content varies among the tested catalysts, optimizing the balance between the Pt and Ni components for maximum catalytic efficiency.

7. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of the Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) is notably lower than that of other reported catalysts, as stated in quote [7]. This lower Ea value indicates that the Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs have a higher catalytic activity, facilitating faster hydrogen generation rates from ammonia borane hydrolysis.

1. 合成支持双金属催化剂的最常用方法是聚醇合成过程，其中使用油酸作为表面活性剂。这些方法的优势在于能够控制颗粒大小和分散性，从而在氨硼烷水解氢生成应用中展现出高催化活性。

2. 聚醇合成过程涉及将镍乙酸和氢氧化钠与油酸混合在去氧乙二醇溶液中，并在氩气气氛下加热。溶液被加热到特定温度，允许形成镍纳米粒子。油酸作为表面活性剂，调节颗粒大小并防止聚集。
