[1] "Among various hydrogen storage materials, ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) has attracted a great deal of attentions as an alternative medium because of its high hydrogen content of 19.6 wt% [3]."
[2] "The catalytic hydrolysis of AB has been studied using various catalysts [5e8], while precious metals such as Pt and Pt-based alloys have been proved to outperform the other non-noble metals [9,10]."
[3] "Therefore, reducing the amount of Pt and improving the activity of Pt-based catalyst is necessary for practical application."
[4] "Among the nanoparticles, Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C displays the highest catalytic activity, delivering a high hydrogen release rate of 5469 mL min−1 g−1 and a low activation energy of 33.0 kJ mol−1."
[5] "In comparison, the apparent activa- tion energies are usually 39 kJ mol−1 for Pt0.65Ni0.35 [15],30 kJ mol−1 for Ni0.88Pt0.12 [14], and 62e70 kJ mol−1 for non-noble metal catalysts [27e29]."
[6] "As the catalyst for AB hydrolysis, the prepared Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) outperform pure Pt and Ni catalysts and are superior to Ni1x@Ptx particles with larger size."
[7] "In the Ni1x@Ptx series, Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) show the highest catalytic activities,resulting in a considerable hydrogen release rate exceeding 5000 mL min−1 g−1 at 25 C as well as high hydrogen genera- tion efficiency and low activation energy."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the use of surfactants in a polyol process. This method allows for the regulation and control of particle size, which is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic activity. Compared to other methods, the polyol process offers advantages in terms of particle size control, which can lead to enhanced performance and efficiency in catalyst production. These methods are particularly effective in creating core-shell nanostructures, which integrate the functionality of individual components into a single particle, offering unique physical and chemical properties. Additionally, the use of oleic acid as a surfactant ensures that the Ni particles remain separated, facilitating the formation of core-shell structures without amalgamation with Pt.
