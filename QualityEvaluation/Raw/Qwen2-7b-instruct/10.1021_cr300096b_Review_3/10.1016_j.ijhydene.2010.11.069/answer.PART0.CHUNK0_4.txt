The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include polyol synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, template-replacement synthesis, and reverse-microemulsion method. These methods differ in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Polyol synthesis involves mixing metal salts and base in an organic solvent with the addition of surfactants to control particle size and morphology. Hydrothermal synthesis utilizes high pressure and temperature to facilitate the formation of nanoparticles. Template-replacement synthesis employs a sacrificial template to create a framework for the growth of nanoparticles. Reverse-microemulsion method involves the formation of a stable emulsion followed by the phase inversion to precipitate nanoparticles. Each method offers unique control over particle size, morphology, and dispersion, contributing to the overall efficacy in catalyst production.
