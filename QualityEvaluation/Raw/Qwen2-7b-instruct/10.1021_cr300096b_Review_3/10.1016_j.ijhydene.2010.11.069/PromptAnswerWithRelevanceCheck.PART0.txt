<quotes>
[1] "Among various hydrogen storage materials, ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) has attracted a great deal of attentions as an alternative medium because of its high hydrogen content of 19.6 wt% [3]."
[2] "The catalytic hydrolysis of AB has been studied using various catalysts [5e8], while precious metals such as Pt and Pt-based alloys have been proved to outperform the other non-noble metals [9,10]."
[3] "Therefore, reducing the amount of Pt and improving the activity of Pt-based catalyst is necessary for practical application."
[4] "Among the nanoparticles, Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C displays the highest catalytic activity, delivering a high hydrogen release rate of 5469 mL min−1 g−1 and a low activation energy of 33.0 kJ mol−1."
[5] "In comparison, the apparent activa- tion energies are usually 39 kJ mol−1 for Pt0.65Ni0.35 [15],30 kJ mol−1 for Ni0.88Pt0.12 [14], and 62e70 kJ mol−1 for non-noble metal catalysts [27e29]."
[6] "As the catalyst for AB hydrolysis, the prepared Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) outperform pure Pt and Ni catalysts and are superior to Ni1x@Ptx particles with larger size."
[7] "In the Ni1x@Ptx series, Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) show the highest catalytic activities,resulting in a considerable hydrogen release rate exceeding 5000 mL min−1 g−1 at 25 C as well as high hydrogen genera- tion efficiency and low activation energy."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve the use of surfactants in a polyol process. This method allows for the regulation and control of particle size, which is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic activity. Compared to other methods, the polyol process offers advantages in terms of particle size control, which can lead to enhanced performance and efficiency in catalyst production. These methods are particularly effective in creating core-shell nanostructures, which integrate the functionality of individual components into a single particle, offering unique physical and chemical properties. Additionally, the use of oleic acid as a surfactant ensures that the Ni particles remain separated, facilitating the formation of core-shell structures without amalgamation with Pt.

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts involve a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant. These methods are advantageous due to their ability to control particle size and dispersion, leading to high catalytic activities in applications such as hydrogen generation from ammonia borane hydrolysis.

2. The polyol synthesis process, as mentioned in quote [2], involves mixing nickel acetate and sodium hydroxide with oleic acid in a deoxygenated ethylene glycol solution under an argon atmosphere. The solution is then heated to a specific temperature, allowing for the formation of nickel nanoparticles. The oleic acid acts as a surfactant, regulating the particle size and preventing agglomeration.

3. The core-shell nanostructured Ni1x@Ptx and Ni1x@Ptx/C (x = 0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) catalysts, synthesized via a surfactant-mediated polyol process, exhibit high catalytic activities for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, surpassing pure platinum and nickel catalysts in terms of efficiency and hydrogen generation rates.

4. In the context of quote [4], the presence of Ni1x@Ptx NPs significantly enhances the catalytic activity during the hydrolysis of ammonia borane compared to pure nickel nanoparticles, suggesting an improvement in hydrogen release kinetics.

5. According to quote [5], the incorporation of carbon support into the catalyst formulation (Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs) further improves the catalytic activity, likely due to enhanced stability, dispersion, and accessibility of the active sites on the metal nanoparticles.

6. The catalytic activities of the synthesized Ni1x@Ptx NPs with varying Pt contents are influenced by the elemental composition. As noted in quote [6], the activity trends demonstrate a volcano-shaped pattern, indicating that the optimal Pt content varies among the tested catalysts, optimizing the balance between the Pt and Ni components for maximum catalytic efficiency.

7. The apparent activation energy (Ea) of the Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs (30 wt% Ni0.33@Pt0.67 loading) is notably lower than that of other reported catalysts, as stated in quote [7]. This lower Ea value indicates that the Ni0.33@Pt0.67/C NPs have a higher catalytic activity, facilitating faster hydrogen generation rates from ammonia borane hydrolysis.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include polyol synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, template-replacement synthesis, and reverse-microemulsion method. These methods differ in terms of their potential advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. Polyol synthesis involves mixing metal salts and base in an organic solvent with the addition of surfactants to control particle size and morphology. Hydrothermal synthesis utilizes high pressure and temperature to facilitate the formation of nanoparticles. Template-replacement synthesis employs a sacrificial template to create a framework for the growth of nanoparticles. Reverse-microemulsion method involves the formation of a stable emulsion followed by the phase inversion to precipitate nanoparticles. Each method offers unique control over particle size, morphology, and dispersion, contributing to the overall efficacy in catalyst production.
