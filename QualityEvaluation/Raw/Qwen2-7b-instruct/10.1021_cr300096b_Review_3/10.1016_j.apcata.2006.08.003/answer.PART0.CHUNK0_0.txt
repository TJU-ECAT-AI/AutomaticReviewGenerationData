The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are the catalytic reduction method, which combines the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support. This method allows for the enhancement of reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols. When these catalysts are immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling, no sintering is observed, indicating the stability of the supported metals. However, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect is completely destroyed upon air exposure at ambient temperature, but a portion of the TiO(2x) moieties remains after the catalysts are immersed in an aqueous medium. Additionally, some germanium deposition occurred independently on the titania support. The effectiveness of these catalysts in selective hydrogenation of citral is further explored in Part II of the paper.

最常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法是催化还原法，结合添加第二金属和使用可还原支撑体。这种方法允许增强不饱和醇的氢化反应活性。当这些催化剂在含水溶液中在氢气泡下浸渍时，没有观察到结块现象，表明支撑金属的稳定性。然而，在室温空气暴露下，强金属-支撑体相互作用（SMSI）效应完全被破坏，但催化剂在水中浸渍后部分TiO(2x)物种仍然存在。此外，一些锗沉积也独立地在二氧化钛上发生。这些催化剂在Part II的论文中进一步探讨了它们对柠檬醛选择性氢化的有效性。
