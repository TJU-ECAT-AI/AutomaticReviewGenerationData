[1] "The preparation of unsaturated alcohols by selective hydrogenation of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance and constitutes a challenging task."
[2] "Recently, Reyes et al. [19], [20] as well as Silva et al. [21], [22] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."
[3] "The important aspect is the influence of a reducible support, TiO2, on the surface and catalytic properties of these such prepared catalysts."
[4] "The hydrogenating properties of these catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of citral will be discussed in Part II of this paper."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the catalytic reduction method. This method involves the surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in water. It is compared favorably due to its ability to effectively deposit germanium in interaction with the parent metal on the titania support. While some germanium deposition also occurs independently on the support, the method ensures stability of both rhodium and platinum particles on the titania support, unlike with silica or alumina supports. This stability and the development of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect upon high-temperature reduction are key advantages. However, the SMSI effect is completely destroyed by air exposure at ambient temperature, but a part of the TiO(2x) moieties remains after immersion of the catalysts in an aqueous medium. The method thus provides a balance between efficient metal deposition and maintaining the catalytic properties of the base metal.

合成支持双金属催化剂的最常用方法包括催化还原法。该方法涉及在水溶性锗盐和用水溶解的氢激活的亲金属催化剂表面之间的表面氧化还原反应。与使用二氧化硅或氧化铝支持相比，这种方法因其能够有效地在二氧化钛支持上与基金属相互作用沉积锗而受到青睐。虽然也会在支持体上独立地沉积一些锗，但该方法确保了铑和铂颗粒在二氧化钛支持上的稳定性。空气暴露于室温下会完全破坏SMSI效应，但在将催化剂浸入水中后，TiO(2x)物种的一部分仍然存在。因此，该方法提供了一种平衡有效金属沉积与保持基金属催化性能的方法。
