[1] "The preparation of unsaturated alcohols by selective hydrogenation of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance and constitutes a challenging task, since the hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically favored over the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group."
[2] "Recently, Reyes et al. [19], [20] as well as Silva et al. [21], [22] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."
[3] "Effectively, no sintering has been observed when they were immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling (catalytic reduction protocol)."
[4] "Their catalytic performances for the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction indicate that all the catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C versus 300 C) developed the strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect, which implied the formation of TiO(2x) species."
[5] "In other words, the blank treatment does not lead to a sintering of the parent metal particles."
[6] "In conclusion, the preparation of bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts by the catalytic reduction method was performed under hydrogen atmosphere between a parent monometallic catalyst (Rh or Pt) and a germanium salt dissolved in an aqueous medium."

1. The preparation of bimetallic catalysts involves combining two metals and using a reducible support to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols. This approach was recently explored by Reyes et al. and Silva et al.

2. When the catalysts were immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling, no sintering was observed, indicating their stability under these conditions.

3. The catalysts developed the strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect at high temperatures, leading to the formation of TiO(2x) species. This effect was more pronounced at 500°C compared to 300°C.

4. The blank treatment, which involves drying the catalysts under hydrogen and then flushing with nitrogen, did not cause sintering of the parent metal particles.

5. The preparation of the catalysts involved a catalytic reduction method under hydrogen atmosphere between a parent monometallic catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in an aqueous medium.

1. 制备双金属催化剂涉及结合两种金属和使用可还原支持，以增强对不饱和醇氢化反应的活性。雷耶斯等人和席尔瓦等人最近对此进行了探索。

2. 当将催化剂浸入含有氢气的水溶液中时，未观察到烧结现象，这表明它们在这些条件下具有稳定性。

3. 在高温下（500°C与300°C），催化剂发展了强烈的金属支持相互作用（SMSI）效应，导致TiO(2x)物种的形成。这种效应在500°C时更为明显。

4. 空白处理，即在氢气下干燥催化剂并随后用惰性气体冲洗，没有导致母金属颗粒的烧结。

5. 催化剂的制备方法是在氢气气氛下通过母单金属催化剂和溶解在水溶液中的锗盐之间进行催化还原。
