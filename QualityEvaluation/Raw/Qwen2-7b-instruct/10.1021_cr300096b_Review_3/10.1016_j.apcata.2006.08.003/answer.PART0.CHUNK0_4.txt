[1] "The preparation of unsaturated alcohols by selective hydrogenation of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance and constitutes a challenging task, since the hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically favoured over the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group."
[2] "Recently, Reyes et al. [19], [20] as well as Silva et al. [21], [22] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."
[3] "The present contribution is the continuation of the study on Rh-Ge systems prepared by catalytic reduction with a comparison to Pt-Ge systems prepared by the same technique."
[4] "This paper deals with the preparation of the titania-supported bimetallic rhodium-germanium and platinum-germanium catalysts by the so-called catalytic reduction method and the effect of their reduction temperature."
[5] "In order to follow the hydrogen consumption in the course of the final reduction of blank and bimetallic catalysts, the different samples were characterized by TPR."
[6] "The results obtained for Rh-500-blank-500-in-situ-500 and Pt-500-blank-500-in-situ-500 bolster this hypothesis. Indeed, Table 3 clearly shows that Rh-500-blank-300-in-situ-300 presents a relative activity close to Rh-500-blank-500-air-500 (0.53 versus 0.49), which means that an important part of TiO(2x) species are maintained after immersion of the catalyst."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts mentioned in the literature are the catalytic reduction method. This method involves activating the metal parent particles with hydrogen, followed by reacting the activated metal with a germanium salt dissolved in water. The process is carried out under hydrogen atmosphere. The catalytic reduction method allows for the effective deposition of germanium in great interaction with the parent metal (rhodium or platinum) supported on titania. Some germanium deposition also occurs independently on the titania support. The method is particularly noted for its ability to maintain the stability of rhodium and platinum particles on titania without causing sintering. The literature highlights the effectiveness of this method in preparing bimetallic catalysts, especially when compared to previous methods used on supports like silica or alumina, where sintering of the metal particles could occur under similar conditions. The catalytic reduction method thus represents an advantageous approach in the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts, offering improved stability and selectivity for reactions such as citral hydrogenation.

文献中提到的最常用的双金属催化剂支持合成方法是催化还原法。该方法包括激活金属母体颗粒并用氢气，然后与溶解在水中的锗盐反应。整个过程都在氢气气氛下进行。催化还原法允许有效在钛酸盐上沉积锗，与母金属（铑或铂）之间有很好的相互作用。部分锗沉积也会独立发生于钛酸盐支撑物上。这种方法特别强调了在维持铑和铂颗粒在钛酸盐上的稳定性方面的优势，而不会导致熔化。与在硅胶或氧化铝等先前使用的支撑材料上使用类似条件时金属颗粒可能发生熔化的现象相比，这种方法显示出在制备支持型双金属催化剂方面具有优势，特别是对于如异构醇氢化这样的反应时。
