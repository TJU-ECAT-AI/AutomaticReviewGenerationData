The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are the catalytic reduction method, which combines the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support. This method allows for the enhancement of reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols. When these catalysts are immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling, no sintering is observed, indicating the stability of the supported metals. However, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect is completely destroyed upon air exposure at ambient temperature, but a portion of the TiO(2x) moieties remains after the catalysts are immersed in an aqueous medium. Additionally, some germanium deposition occurred independently on the titania support. The effectiveness of these catalysts in selective hydrogenation of citral is further explored in Part II of the paper.

最常用的制备支持型双金属催化剂的方法是催化还原法，结合添加第二金属和使用可还原支撑体。这种方法允许增强不饱和醇的氢化反应活性。当这些催化剂在含水溶液中在氢气泡下浸渍时，没有观察到结块现象，表明支撑金属的稳定性。然而，在室温空气暴露下，强金属-支撑体相互作用（SMSI）效应完全被破坏，但催化剂在水中浸渍后部分TiO(2x)物种仍然存在。此外，一些锗沉积也独立地在二氧化钛上发生。这些催化剂在Part II的论文中进一步探讨了它们对柠檬醛选择性氢化的有效性。

[1] "The preparation of unsaturated alcohols by selective hydrogenation of the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has a great industrial importance and constitutes a challenging task, since the hydrogenation of the CC bond is thermodynamically favored over the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group."
[2] "Recently, Reyes et al. [19], [20] as well as Silva et al. [21], [22] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."
[3] "Effectively, no sintering has been observed when they were immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling (catalytic reduction protocol)."
[4] "Their catalytic performances for the cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction indicate that all the catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C versus 300 C) developed the strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect, which implied the formation of TiO(2x) species."
[5] "In other words, the blank treatment does not lead to a sintering of the parent metal particles."
[6] "In conclusion, the preparation of bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts by the catalytic reduction method was performed under hydrogen atmosphere between a parent monometallic catalyst (Rh or Pt) and a germanium salt dissolved in an aqueous medium."

2. When the catalysts were immersed in an aqueous solution under hydrogen bubbling, no sintering was observed, indicating their stability under these conditions.

3. The catalysts developed the strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect at high temperatures, leading to the formation of TiO(2x) species. This effect was more pronounced at 500°C compared to 300°C.

4. The blank treatment, which involves drying the catalysts under hydrogen and then flushing with nitrogen, did not cause sintering of the parent metal particles.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include the catalytic reduction method. This method involves the surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in water. It is compared favorably due to its ability to effectively deposit germanium in interaction with the parent metal on the titania support. While some germanium deposition also occurs independently on the support, the method ensures stability of both rhodium and platinum particles on the titania support, unlike with silica or alumina supports. This stability and the development of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect upon high-temperature reduction are key advantages. However, the SMSI effect is completely destroyed by air exposure at ambient temperature, but a part of the TiO(2x) moieties remains after immersion of the catalysts in an aqueous medium. The method thus provides a balance between efficient metal deposition and maintaining the catalytic properties of the base metal.

合成支持双金属催化剂的最常用方法包括催化还原法。该方法涉及在水溶性锗盐和用水溶解的氢激活的亲金属催化剂表面之间的表面氧化还原反应。与使用二氧化硅或氧化铝支持相比，这种方法因其能够有效地在二氧化钛支持上与基金属相互作用沉积锗而受到青睐。虽然也会在支持体上独立地沉积一些锗，但该方法确保了铑和铂颗粒在二氧化钛支持上的稳定性。空气暴露于室温下会完全破坏SMSI效应，但在将催化剂浸入水中后，TiO(2x)物种的一部分仍然存在。因此，该方法提供了一种平衡有效金属沉积与保持基金属催化性能的方法。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts mentioned in the literature are the catalytic reduction method. This method involves the surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a metal parent particle and a germanium salt dissolved in water. The method allows for the effective deposition of germanium in great interaction with the parent metal (rhodium or platinum) supported on titania. However, some germanium deposition can also occur separately on the titania support. The catalytic reduction method was employed in the preparation of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania for the hydrogenation of citral. The literature highlights the advantage of using a reducible support, titanium dioxide (titania), as it prevents sintering of the metal particles and maintains their stability. The reduction temperature affects the stability of the metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect and the particle size distribution of the catalysts. The SMSI effect leads to the formation of TiO(2x) species, which enhances the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of citral. The catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalysts are significantly influenced by the addition of germanium, which can inhibit the specific activity of both rhodium and platinum. The literature discusses the effect of germanium content, air exposure, and immersion in an aqueous medium on the stability of the SMSI effect and the catalytic performance of the catalysts. The results indicate that the SMSI effect is more pronounced on platinum-based catalysts than on rhodium-based catalysts, and it is partially destroyed by air exposure or immersion in an aqueous medium. However, the stability of the SMSI effect is more marked on platinum-based catalysts compared to rhodium-based catalysts. The literature also provides evidence that the catalytic reduction method is efficient in preparing supported bimetallic catalysts with desirable properties for the hydrogenation of citral.

文献中提到的最常用的合成双金属催化剂的方法是催化还原法。这种方法涉及在水溶液中激活氢，然后与溶解在水中的锗盐反应，以在钛酸盐支持的金属（铑或铂）上实现锗的有效沉积。该方法允许与钛酸盐支持的金属（铑或铂）在大范围内发生强烈的相互作用。然而，也可能会在钛酸盐支持物上独立沉积一些锗。使用催化还原法准备了钛酸盐支持的双金属铑锗和铂锗催化剂，用于异构化柠檬醛。文献强调使用可还原支持物（钛酸盐）的优点，因为它可以防止金属颗粒的聚集并保持它们的稳定性。还原温度影响金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）效应的稳定性和催化剂颗粒尺寸分布。SMSI效应导致形成TiO(2x)物种，这提高了对异构化柠檬醛的催化活性。添加锗对双金属催化剂的催化性能有显著影响，它可以抑制铑和铂的特定活性。文献讨论了锗含量、空气暴露和浸入水溶液介质对SMSI效应稳定性和催化剂性能的影响。结果表明，SMSI效应在铂基催化剂中比在铑基催化剂中更明显，并且在空气暴露或浸入水中介质后被部分破坏。然而，与铑基催化剂相比，铂基催化剂中SMSI效应的稳定性更高。文献还提供了证据，证明催化还原法在准备具有所需性质的异构化柠檬醛催化剂方面是有效的。

[6] "The results obtained for Rh-500-blank-500-in-situ-500 and Pt-500-blank-500-in-situ-500 bolster this hypothesis. Indeed, Table 3 clearly shows that Rh-500-blank-300-in-situ-300 presents a relative activity close to Rh-500-blank-500-air-500 (0.53 versus 0.49), which means that an important part of TiO(2x) species are maintained after immersion of the catalyst."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts mentioned in the literature are the catalytic reduction method. This method involves activating the metal parent particles with hydrogen, followed by reacting the activated metal with a germanium salt dissolved in water. The process is carried out under hydrogen atmosphere. The catalytic reduction method allows for the effective deposition of germanium in great interaction with the parent metal (rhodium or platinum) supported on titania. Some germanium deposition also occurs independently on the titania support. The method is particularly noted for its ability to maintain the stability of rhodium and platinum particles on titania without causing sintering. The literature highlights the effectiveness of this method in preparing bimetallic catalysts, especially when compared to previous methods used on supports like silica or alumina, where sintering of the metal particles could occur under similar conditions. The catalytic reduction method thus represents an advantageous approach in the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts, offering improved stability and selectivity for reactions such as citral hydrogenation.
