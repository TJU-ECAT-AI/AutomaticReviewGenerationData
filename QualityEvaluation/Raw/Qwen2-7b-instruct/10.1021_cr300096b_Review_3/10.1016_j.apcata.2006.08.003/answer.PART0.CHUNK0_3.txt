The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts mentioned in the literature are the catalytic reduction method. This method involves the surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a metal parent particle and a germanium salt dissolved in water. The method allows for the effective deposition of germanium in great interaction with the parent metal (rhodium or platinum) supported on titania. However, some germanium deposition can also occur separately on the titania support. The catalytic reduction method was employed in the preparation of bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania for the hydrogenation of citral. The literature highlights the advantage of using a reducible support, titanium dioxide (titania), as it prevents sintering of the metal particles and maintains their stability. The reduction temperature affects the stability of the metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect and the particle size distribution of the catalysts. The SMSI effect leads to the formation of TiO(2x) species, which enhances the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of citral. The catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalysts are significantly influenced by the addition of germanium, which can inhibit the specific activity of both rhodium and platinum. The literature discusses the effect of germanium content, air exposure, and immersion in an aqueous medium on the stability of the SMSI effect and the catalytic performance of the catalysts. The results indicate that the SMSI effect is more pronounced on platinum-based catalysts than on rhodium-based catalysts, and it is partially destroyed by air exposure or immersion in an aqueous medium. However, the stability of the SMSI effect is more marked on platinum-based catalysts compared to rhodium-based catalysts. The literature also provides evidence that the catalytic reduction method is efficient in preparing supported bimetallic catalysts with desirable properties for the hydrogenation of citral.

文献中提到的最常用的合成双金属催化剂的方法是催化还原法。这种方法涉及在水溶液中激活氢，然后与溶解在水中的锗盐反应，以在钛酸盐支持的金属（铑或铂）上实现锗的有效沉积。该方法允许与钛酸盐支持的金属（铑或铂）在大范围内发生强烈的相互作用。然而，也可能会在钛酸盐支持物上独立沉积一些锗。使用催化还原法准备了钛酸盐支持的双金属铑锗和铂锗催化剂，用于异构化柠檬醛。文献强调使用可还原支持物（钛酸盐）的优点，因为它可以防止金属颗粒的聚集并保持它们的稳定性。还原温度影响金属-支持相互作用（SMSI）效应的稳定性和催化剂颗粒尺寸分布。SMSI效应导致形成TiO(2x)物种，这提高了对异构化柠檬醛的催化活性。添加锗对双金属催化剂的催化性能有显著影响，它可以抑制铑和铂的特定活性。文献讨论了锗含量、空气暴露和浸入水溶液介质对SMSI效应稳定性和催化剂性能的影响。结果表明，SMSI效应在铂基催化剂中比在铑基催化剂中更明显，并且在空气暴露或浸入水中介质后被部分破坏。然而，与铑基催化剂相比，铂基催化剂中SMSI效应的稳定性更高。文献还提供了证据，证明催化还原法在准备具有所需性质的异构化柠檬醛催化剂方面是有效的。
