1. In early studies, the promoter salts were added directly to the reactor during the hydrogenation process.
2. Unfortunately, the impregnation technique often does not ensure a close contact between the two metals, which is crucial for optimal performance.
3. The technique used to prepare bimetallic catalysts involves deposition under hydrogen atmosphere, known as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP).
4. The RDP technique has proven advantageous for catalytic performance, but detailed studies on the interaction between promoters and active metals are still lacking.
5. Bimetallic platinum/carbon nanofiber (Pt/CNF) catalysts were synthesized using tin(IV), tin(II), and gallium(III) compounds through RDP.
6. During the catalytic tests, less than 3.8% by-products were observed in all reactions, regardless of whether they were conducted at low or high pressure.
7. The findings suggest that the ideal activity level is not solely determined by the amount of promoter used but can vary based on different testing conditions.

1. 在早期的研究中，促剂盐是在氢化过程中直接添加到反应器中的。
2. 不幸的是，浸渍技术往往无法确保两种金属之间形成紧密接触，这对于最佳性能至关重要。
3. 制备双金属催化剂的技术是在氢气氛下沉积，称为还原沉积沉淀（RDP）。
4. RDP技术已经证明了对于催化性能的优势，但对促剂与活性金属之间的相互作用的详细研究仍然缺乏。
5. 使用锡(IV)、锡(II)和镓(III)化合物通过RDP方法在单金属Pt/CNF催化剂上合成双金属铂/碳纳米纤维（Pt/CNF）催化剂。
6. 在催化测试中，在低或高压下进行的所有反应中都观察到少于3.8%的副产品。
7. 研究结果表明，理想的活动水平不仅仅取决于使用的促剂量，而是可以根据不同的测试条件而变化。
