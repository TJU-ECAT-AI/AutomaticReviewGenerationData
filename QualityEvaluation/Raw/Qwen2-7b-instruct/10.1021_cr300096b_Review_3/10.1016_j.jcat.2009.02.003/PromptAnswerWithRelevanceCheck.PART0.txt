[1] "In early studies, the promoter salts were added in the reactor during the hydrogenation."
[2] "Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[3] "This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."
[4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated,"
[5] "Detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."
[6] "Bimetallic Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by deposition of tin(IV), tin(II) and gallium(III) compounds on the monometallic Pt/CNF catalyst via RDP."
[7] "It has been observed that for all test reactions (also when performed at high pressure) <3.8% by-products were formed."
[8] "Our results suggest that the optimum activity does not depend on a particular amount of promoter only, but may shift due to application of different test conditions as well."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). RDP involves depositing the second metal under hydrogen atmosphere, which results in a close contact between the metals, whereas IWI involves adding the metal salt to the catalyst, which may not always ensure a close contact. RDP also allows for preparation below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, offering additional flexibility. However, detailed characterization of the interaction between promoters and the active metal is still lacking.
2. The synthesis methods of RDP and IWI compare differently in terms of their advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. RDP tends to produce catalysts with better interaction between metals due to the deposition under hydrogen atmosphere, potentially leading to enhanced activity and selectivity. IWI, on the other hand, is more straightforward but might not always result in the same level of metal interaction. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst, such as the desired metal distribution and the application context.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的主要方法是还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和初始湿润浸渍（IWI）。RDP通过在氢气气氛下沉积第二金属，从而形成两种金属之间的紧密接触。而IWI则是将金属盐添加到催化剂中，这可能不会总是确保两种金属之间的紧密接触。RDP还可以在氧化还原反应的平衡电位之下进行制备，提供额外的灵活性。然而，到目前为止，对促进剂与活性金属之间相互作用的详细表征仍然缺乏。
2. RDP和IWI在优势、应用范围和整体效能方面进行比较时，有不同的考量。RDP倾向于产生由于在氢气气氛下沉积而形成的催化剂，金属之间具有更好的相互作用，可能带来增强的活性和选择性。而IWI则更为直接，但可能不会总是达到相同的金属相互作用水平。根据催化剂的具体需求，如期望的金属分布和应用背景，选择这两种方法中的任何一种都有其合理性。

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). Impregnation techniques have been widely reported, but they do not always guarantee a close contact between the two metals, which is crucial for catalytic performance. RDP offers the advantage of preparing bimetallic catalysts below the equilibrium potential, enabling controlled surface reactions and potentially achieving a close contact between metals, although detailed characterization of the interaction remains challenging.
2. The synthesis of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, offering an alternative to traditional impregnation methods. This technique facilitates the preparation of catalysts with controlled metal interactions, potentially enhancing catalytic performance.

1. 制备双金属催化剂的最常用方法包括浸渍法和还原沉积沉淀（RDP）。浸渍技术已被广泛报道，但它们不总是能够保证两种金属之间形成紧密接触，这对催化性能至关重要。RDP提供了一种在红ox反应的平衡电势以下制备催化剂的方法，这使得控制表面反应成为可能，并有可能实现金属之间的紧密接触，尽管对金属相互作用的详细表征仍然具有挑战性。
2. 通过RDP可以将双金属催化剂在低于红ox反应的平衡电势下制备出来，提供了一种替代传统的浸渍方法。这种技术允许以可控的方式制备具有紧密金属相互作用的催化剂，从而可能提高催化性能。

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). RDP has the potential advantage of resulting in a close contact between the promoter and the active metal, which can enhance catalytic performance. However, this technique does not guarantee a close contact between the two metals. IWI, on the other hand, adds the promoter salts during the hydrogenation process, but this method does not ensure a close contact between the metals. RDP can be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, making it a versatile technique for catalyst preparation. Detailed characterization of the interaction between promoters and active metals is still lacking. The effect of heat treatment on the selectivity of the catalyst depends on the size of the metal particles, with larger particles leading to a decrease in selectivity for heat-treated platinum on carbon nanofibers. Activity is primarily influenced by reaction conditions such as pressure and reactant concentration, rather than the synthesis method alone.
