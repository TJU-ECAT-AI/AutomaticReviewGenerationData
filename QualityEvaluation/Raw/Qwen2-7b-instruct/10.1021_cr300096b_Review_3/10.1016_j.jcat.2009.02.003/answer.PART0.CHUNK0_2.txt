[1] "In early studies, the promoter salts were added in the reactor during the hydrogenation."
[2] "It is more convenient to make the promoter part of the catalyst."
[3] "Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[4] "Moreover, identification of the nature of the bimetallic phase remains challenging."
[5] "Preparation of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can also be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction."
[6] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated,"
[7] "Detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."
[8] "Therefore, in this study we investigated the platinumpromoter interaction for RDP-prepared, CNF-supported bimetallic catalysts using TEM-EDX, XPS and EXAFS."
[9] "Bimetallic Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by deposition of tin(IV), tin(II) and gallium(III) compounds on the monometallic Pt/CNF catalyst via RDP."
[10] "To the best of our knowledge, deposition of gallium in this way has not been reported before."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP). Impregnation techniques have been widely reported, but they do not always guarantee a close contact between the two metals, which is crucial for catalytic performance. RDP offers the advantage of preparing bimetallic catalysts below the equilibrium potential, enabling controlled surface reactions and potentially achieving a close contact between metals, although detailed characterization of the interaction remains challenging.
2. The synthesis of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, offering an alternative to traditional impregnation methods. This technique facilitates the preparation of catalysts with controlled metal interactions, potentially enhancing catalytic performance.

1. 制备双金属催化剂的最常用方法包括浸渍法和还原沉积沉淀（RDP）。浸渍技术已被广泛报道，但它们不总是能够保证两种金属之间形成紧密接触，这对催化性能至关重要。RDP提供了一种在红ox反应的平衡电势以下制备催化剂的方法，这使得控制表面反应成为可能，并有可能实现金属之间的紧密接触，尽管对金属相互作用的详细表征仍然具有挑战性。
2. 通过RDP可以将双金属催化剂在低于红ox反应的平衡电势下制备出来，提供了一种替代传统的浸渍方法。这种技术允许以可控的方式制备具有紧密金属相互作用的催化剂，从而可能提高催化性能。
