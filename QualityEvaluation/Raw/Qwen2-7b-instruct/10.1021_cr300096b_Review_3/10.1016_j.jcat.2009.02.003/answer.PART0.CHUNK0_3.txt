1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). RDP has the potential advantage of resulting in a close contact between the promoter and the active metal, which can enhance catalytic performance. However, this technique does not guarantee a close contact between the two metals. IWI, on the other hand, adds the promoter salts during the hydrogenation process, but this method does not ensure a close contact between the metals. RDP can be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, making it a versatile technique for catalyst preparation. Detailed characterization of the interaction between promoters and active metals is still lacking. The effect of heat treatment on the selectivity of the catalyst depends on the size of the metal particles, with larger particles leading to a decrease in selectivity for heat-treated platinum on carbon nanofibers. Activity is primarily influenced by reaction conditions such as pressure and reactant concentration, rather than the synthesis method alone.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的最常用方法是还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和初始湿性浸渍（IWI）。RDP的优势在于能够导致促进剂与活性金属之间的紧密接触，从而提高催化性能。然而，这种技术并不保证两种金属之间有紧密的接触。IWI是在氢化过程中添加促进剂盐，但这种方法不能确保金属之间的紧密接触。RDP可以在红ox反应的平衡电位以下进行，使其成为一种灵活的催化剂制备技术。对促进剂与活性金属相互作用的详细表征仍然缺乏。热处理对催化剂选择性的影响取决于金属颗粒的大小，热处理后的铂碳纳米纤维催化剂中较大的颗粒会导致选择性降低。活性主要受反应条件的影响，如压力和反应物浓度，而不是合成方法本身。
