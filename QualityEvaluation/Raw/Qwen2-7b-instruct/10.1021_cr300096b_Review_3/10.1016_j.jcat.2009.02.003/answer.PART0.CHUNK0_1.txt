[1] "In early studies, the promoter salts were added in the reactor during the hydrogenation."
[2] "Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[3] "Preparation of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can also be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction."
[4] "Detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."
[5] "This results in a higher selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol for the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, irrespective the applied hydrogenation pressure."
[6] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). RDP involves depositing the second metal under hydrogen atmosphere, which results in a close contact between the metals, whereas IWI involves adding the metal salt to the catalyst, which may not always ensure a close contact. RDP also allows for preparation below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, offering additional flexibility. However, detailed characterization of the interaction between promoters and the active metal is still lacking.
2. The synthesis methods of RDP and IWI compare differently in terms of their advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. RDP tends to produce catalysts with better interaction between metals due to the deposition under hydrogen atmosphere, potentially leading to enhanced activity and selectivity. IWI, on the other hand, is more straightforward but might not always result in the same level of metal interaction. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst, such as the desired metal distribution and the application context.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的主要方法是还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和初始湿润浸渍（IWI）。RDP通过在氢气气氛下沉积第二金属，从而形成两种金属之间的紧密接触。而IWI则是将金属盐添加到催化剂中，这可能不会总是确保两种金属之间的紧密接触。RDP还可以在氧化还原反应的平衡电位之下进行制备，提供额外的灵活性。然而，到目前为止，对促进剂与活性金属之间相互作用的详细表征仍然缺乏。
2. RDP和IWI在优势、应用范围和整体效能方面进行比较时，有不同的考量。RDP倾向于产生由于在氢气气氛下沉积而形成的催化剂，金属之间具有更好的相互作用，可能带来增强的活性和选择性。而IWI则更为直接，但可能不会总是达到相同的金属相互作用水平。根据催化剂的具体需求，如期望的金属分布和应用背景，选择这两种方法中的任何一种都有其合理性。
