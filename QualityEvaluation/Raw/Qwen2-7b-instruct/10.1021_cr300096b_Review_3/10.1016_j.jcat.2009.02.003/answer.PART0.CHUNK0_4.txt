1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). RDP allows for a close contact between the two metals, whereas IWI does not guarantee such an interaction. This close contact is crucial for enhancing catalytic selectivity.

2. The RDP technique offers several advantages over other synthesis methods, such as the ability to deposit metals under hydrogen atmosphere, potentially leading to better dispersion and interaction between metals. However, the detailed characterization of the interaction between the promoter and the active metal is still lacking.

3. The RDP method was employed to prepare bimetallic Pt/CNF catalysts by depositing tin(IV), tin(II), and gallium(III) compounds on the monometallic Pt/CNF catalyst. This process facilitated the creation of a close interaction between platinum and the promoters.

4. The hydrogen chemisorption results, expressed as H/Pt ratio, were summarized in Table 3, providing insights into the surface properties of the catalysts and their hydrogenation capacities.

1. 制备双金属催化剂的常用方法包括还原沉积沉淀（RDP）和浸渍湿法。RDP允许两种金属之间形成紧密接触，而IWI方法可能无法确保这种相互作用。这种紧密接触对于提高催化选择性至关重要。

2. RDP技术在其他合成方法中提供了几个优势，例如在氢气气氛下沉积金属，这可能导致更好的分散性和金属之间的相互作用。然而，关于促进剂与活性金属之间相互作用的详细表征仍然缺乏。

3. 使用RDP方法制备了双金属Pt/CNF催化剂，通过在单金属Pt/CNF催化剂上沉积四价锡、二价锡和三价镓化合物。这一过程促进了铂与促进剂之间的紧密相互作用的形成。

4. 氢化吸附结果以H/Pt比的形式总结在表3中，提供了催化剂表面特性的见解以及它们的氢化能力。
