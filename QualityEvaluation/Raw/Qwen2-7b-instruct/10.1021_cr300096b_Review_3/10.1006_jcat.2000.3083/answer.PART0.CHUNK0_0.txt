The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include chemical methods, laser vaporization, and other physical methods. Chemical methods involve the addition of a second metal to a support material through chemical reactions, which can control the size, morphology, and composition of the catalysts to some extent. However, it is challenging to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one using these methods due to difficulties in controlling the size, structure, or composition of the active phases.

Laser vaporization, on the other hand, provides a means to generate ligand-free metal clusters and ensures that the bimetallic particles all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target. This technique allows for the preparation of monometallic and bimetallic systems with approximately the same size, morphology, and overall, uniform and well-defined composition. This makes comparisons between the catalytic properties of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts easier.

常用的制备负载型双金属催化剂的方法包括化学方法、激光蒸发法和其他物理方法。化学方法通过化学反应向载体材料中添加第二种金属，可以在一定程度上控制催化剂的大小、形态和组成。然而，使用这些方法比较双金属催化剂与单金属催化剂的催化性能较为困难，原因在于难以精确控制活性相的尺寸、结构或组成。

激光蒸发法则提供了一种生成无配体金属簇的方法，并确保双金属颗粒的组成与蒸发合金目标的组成完全一致。这种方法允许制备具有大致相同大小、形态和整体均匀且定义明确组成的单金属和双金属系统，从而使得单金属催化剂与双金属催化剂的催化性能比较变得更为容易。
