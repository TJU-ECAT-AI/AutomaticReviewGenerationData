[1] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remark- ably uniform composition."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include chemical methods, laser vaporization, and other physical methods. Chemical methods involve the addition of a second metal to a support material through chemical reactions, which can control the size, morphology, and composition of the catalysts to some extent. However, it is challenging to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one using these methods due to difficulties in controlling the size, structure, or composition of the active phases.

Laser vaporization, on the other hand, provides a means to generate ligand-free metal clusters and ensures that the bimetallic particles all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target. This technique allows for the preparation of monometallic and bimetallic systems with approximately the same size, morphology, and overall, uniform and well-defined composition. This makes comparisons between the catalytic properties of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts easier.

常用的制备负载型双金属催化剂的方法包括化学方法、激光蒸发法和其他物理方法。化学方法通过化学反应向载体材料中添加第二种金属，可以在一定程度上控制催化剂的大小、形态和组成。然而，使用这些方法比较双金属催化剂与单金属催化剂的催化性能较为困难，原因在于难以精确控制活性相的尺寸、结构或组成。

激光蒸发法则提供了一种生成无配体金属簇的方法，并确保双金属颗粒的组成与蒸发合金目标的组成完全一致。这种方法允许制备具有大致相同大小、形态和整体均匀且定义明确组成的单金属和双金属系统，从而使得单金属催化剂与双金属催化剂的催化性能比较变得更为容易。

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include chemical methods and laser vaporization techniques. Chemical methods involve the use of precursors that are mixed with a support material, while laser vaporization creates clusters with a uniform composition that are then deposited on the support. The advantages of laser vaporization include the ability to produce clusters with precise sizes and compositions, which can be crucial for achieving consistent catalytic performance. Applications of bimetallic catalysts include the hydrogenation of aromatics and olefins in hydrocarbon feedstocks, where the sulfur tolerance of PdPt alloys on acidic supports is often highlighted.

2. In terms of activity or selectivity, bimetallic catalysts can differ significantly from their monometallic counterparts. Studies by Koussathana et al. (2) showed that bimetallic PdPt formulations exhibit higher activities towards hydrogenation of naphthalene and biphenyl compared to the pure metals. However, Deganello and colleagues (5) observed that the addition of platinum reduces both the activity and selectivity of palladium catalysts in certain reactions, such as the liquid-phase hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene to cyclooctene. Carturan et al. (4) found that the specific activity of PdPt catalysts is smaller than the sum of individual palladium and platinum activities in the 10-100% platinum range when hydrogenating phenylacetylene to styrene. This indicates that the synergy between the metals is not always beneficial and can sometimes result in a decrease in activity.

3. The behavior of bimetallic catalysts can be influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the type of support used. The sulfur tolerance of PdPt alloys deposited on various supports, including Al2O3, SiO2Al2O3, Al2O3B2O3, and HY zeolite, has been a focus of research (6-10). This is important because sulfur can poison catalysts, leading to a decrease in their efficiency. The ability of PdPt catalysts to withstand sulfur poisoning is crucial for their industrial applications, particularly in processes involving hydrocarbons that may contain sulfur compounds.

1. 支持型双金属催化剂的最常用合成方法包括化学方法和激光蒸发技术。化学方法涉及使用前体与支撑材料混合，而激光蒸发技术则能够产生具有精确大小和组成分布的簇，然后将其沉积在支撑材料上。激光蒸发技术的优势在于能够生产出具有精确尺寸和组成的簇，这对于实现一致的催化性能至关重要。双金属催化剂的应用包括在烃类流体中氢化芳香族化合物和烯烃，其中钯铂合金在酸性支持物上的硫容忍度经常被强调。

2. 双金属催化剂的活性或选择性可能与单金属催化剂大不相同。Koussathana等人（2）的研究表明，钯铂复合配方在对萘和二苯基甲烷的氢化反应中的活性高于纯金属。然而，Deganello及其同事（5）观察到，在某些反应如液相氢化环辛二烯为环辛烯时，铂的添加会同时降低钯催化剂的活性和选择性。Carturan等人（4）发现，钯铂催化剂在将苯乙烯氢化为苯乙炔的特定条件下，其特定活性低于单独的钯和铂活性之和。这表明这两种金属之间的协同作用并不总是有益的，有时会导致活性下降。

3. 双金属催化剂的行为受到温度、压力和所用支持物类型等因素的影响。钯铂合金在不同支持物（如氧化铝、二氧化硅氧化铝、氧化铝硼酸盐、HY沸石）上的硫容忍度是研究的重点（6-10）。这是因为硫可能导致催化剂中毒，导致效率下降。钯铂催化剂抵抗硫中毒的能力对于其工业应用至关重要，特别是在处理可能含有硫化合物的烃类过程中。

1. The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include laser vaporization, chemical methods, and physical methods such as impregnation. Laser vaporization stands out due to its ability to produce bimetallic clusters with remarkably uniform composition, independent of any possible support effect.

2. The results concerning the pure metals are in agreement with those of the literature. On the bimetallic catalysts, it has been demonstrated that no synergy between the two elements can be evidenced, the rates being perfectly explained by an additivity of the properties of the two metals.

3. The behavior of the Pd17Pt83 bimetallic system at high temperature, which shows a cooperative effect between Pd and Pt, is interpreted by the ability of Pd to supply hydrogen in sufficient amount, whereas the aromatics remain more strongly bonded on platinum.

4. The uniformity of composition achieved by the laser vaporization technique is attributed to the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, unlike chemical methods where the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support.

5. The addition of Pt reduces both the activity and the selectivity of the Pd catalysts in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene to cyclooctene, as observed by Deganello and co-workers (5).

6. The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been used to test the catalysts due to its extensive study over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique.

7. The laser vaporization technique is adapted to obtain bimetallic catalysts with all kinds of alloys, even with nonmiscible metals like Au Ni (19) or AgNi (31), as it is in principle applicable for this purpose.

1. 制备支持型双金属催化剂的最常用方法包括激光蒸发、化学方法和物理方法如浸渍。激光蒸发因其能够产生具有明显均匀组成的双金属簇而脱颖而出，独立于任何可能的支持效应。

2. 对于纯金属而言，其结果与文献中的一致。在双金属催化剂上，已证明无法观察到两种元素之间的协同作用，速率完全由两种金属的性质相加解释。

3. 在高温度下，Pd17Pt83双金属系统的协同作用被解释为Pd能够提供足够的氢气，而芳香族化合物则更牢固地绑定在铂上。

4. 激光蒸发技术的均匀性是由于簇在沉积前已经形成，不同于化学方法，其中组成由前体对支持物的亲和力决定。

5. Deganello及其同事观察到，在液相氢化1,3-环辛二烯生成环辛烯的过程中，添加Pt会降低Pd催化剂的活性和选择性（5）。

6. 由于范尼斯特鲁伊小组对使用浸渍技术制备的Pd/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3单金属催化剂的广泛研究，使用气相苯酚氢化测试催化剂。

7. 激光蒸发技术适用于所有类型的合金，甚至非互溶金属如Au Ni（19）或AgNi（31），因为它原则上适用于此目的。

1. The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically involve chemical methods and laser vaporization techniques. Chemical methods may offer advantages in terms of control over composition and morphology, but laser vaporization provides uniform composition and morphology across the catalyst particles, making comparisons with monometallic catalysts easier.

2. Chemical methods for producing supported bimetallic catalysts allow for precise control over the composition and morphology of the catalysts, which can be tailored for specific applications. Laser vaporization, on the other hand, generates clusters with a perfectly defined stoichiometry, facilitating easier comparison of catalytic properties between bimetallic and monometallic systems.

3. Chemical methods are often employed for preparing supported bimetallic catalysts, while laser vaporization is used to create clusters with uniform composition, enabling straightforward comparisons with monometallic catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity.

4. Bimetallic catalysts based on the combination of palladium and platinum have been widely studied. However, their performance in specific reactions can vary significantly compared to their monometallic counterparts, depending on factors such as the support material and the reaction conditions.

5. In the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, the specific activity of palladium-platinum bimetallic catalysts is found to be lower than the combined activity of pure palladium and platinum when the percentage of platinum is within the 10-100% range. This indicates that synergy between the two metals does not necessarily enhance the overall catalytic activity in this particular reaction.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are laser vaporization and chemical methods. Laser vaporization provides clusters with a remarkably uniform composition, which is advantageous for studying the effect of alloying on reactivity independently of any possible support effect. Chemical methods, on the other hand, are governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support, potentially leading to variations in the catalyst's composition. The paper demonstrates that the laser vaporization technique is effective in preparing bimetallic catalysts with well-defined compositions, suitable for testing their catalytic behavior in vapor-phase reactions like toluene hydrogenation.
