<p>Supported metal catalysts modified by addition of a second metal may substantially differ in terms of activity or selectivity from their monometallic counterparts (1).</p>
<p>The final goal of catalytic studies with alloy catalysts is to learn about the functioning of metals and to rationally design catalysts with improved catalytic properties.</p>
<p>Bimetallic catalysts based on the association of palladium and platinum have been extensively studied.</p>
<p>In the case of the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, Carturan et al. (4) found that the specific activity of PdPt catalysts is smaller than the sum of individual Pd and Pt in the 10100% Pt range.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Deganello and co-workers (5) observed that the addition of Pt reduces both the activity and the selectivity of the Pd catalysts in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene to cyclooctene.</p>

1. The synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts typically involve chemical methods and laser vaporization techniques. Chemical methods may offer advantages in terms of control over composition and morphology, but laser vaporization provides uniform composition and morphology across the catalyst particles, making comparisons with monometallic catalysts easier.

2. Chemical methods for producing supported bimetallic catalysts allow for precise control over the composition and morphology of the catalysts, which can be tailored for specific applications. Laser vaporization, on the other hand, generates clusters with a perfectly defined stoichiometry, facilitating easier comparison of catalytic properties between bimetallic and monometallic systems.

3. Chemical methods are often employed for preparing supported bimetallic catalysts, while laser vaporization is used to create clusters with uniform composition, enabling straightforward comparisons with monometallic catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity.

4. Bimetallic catalysts based on the combination of palladium and platinum have been widely studied. However, their performance in specific reactions can vary significantly compared to their monometallic counterparts, depending on factors such as the support material and the reaction conditions.

5. In the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, the specific activity of palladium-platinum bimetallic catalysts is found to be lower than the combined activity of pure palladium and platinum when the percentage of platinum is within the 10-100% range. This indicates that synergy between the two metals does not necessarily enhance the overall catalytic activity in this particular reaction.

1. 合金催化剂的合成方法通常包括化学方法和激光蒸发技术。化学方法可能在控制组分和形态方面具有优势，而激光蒸发技术则提供了均匀的组成和形态，使与单金属催化剂的比较变得容易。

2. 化学方法用于制备支持的双金属催化剂，允许精确控制催化剂的组成和形态，这可以针对特定应用进行定制。相比之下，激光蒸发技术生成具有明确定义组成的簇，使得与单金属催化剂之间的活性和选择性比较更加简单直接。

3. 化学方法常用于制备支持的双金属催化剂，而激光蒸发技术则用于创建具有均匀组成的簇，这使得在活性和选择性方面与单金属催化剂进行比较变得更容易。

4. 基于钯和铂的合金催化剂已经在广泛研究。然而，在特定反应中，它们的性能与它们的单金属对应物相比可能会有很大差异，这取决于诸如支持材料和反应条件等因素。

5. 在苯乙炔氢化为苯乙烯的过程中，钯-铂合金催化剂的特定活性被发现低于纯钯和铂的组合活性，当铂的百分比位于10-100%范围内时。这表明在这一特定反应中，两种金属之间的协同作用并不一定增强总体催化活性。
