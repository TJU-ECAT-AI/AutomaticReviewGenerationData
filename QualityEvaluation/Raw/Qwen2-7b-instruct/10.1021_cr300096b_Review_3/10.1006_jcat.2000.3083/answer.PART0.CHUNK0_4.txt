[1] "Supported metal catalysts modified by addition of a second metal may substantially differ in terms of activity or selectivity from their monometallic counterparts (1)."
[2] "The purpose of this paper is to show that all these criteria are fulfilled by using the laser vaporization technique."
[3] "In this paper, we report on the preparation, the character- ization, and the catalytic behavior of pure Pd or Pt as well as bimetallic PdPt clusters produced by laser vaporization of bulk metals and alloys and deposited on high surface area alumina (γ -Al2O3)."
[4] "The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been used to test our catalysts since this reaction has been extensively studied by the group of Vannice over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 (15) and Pt/Al2O3 (16) catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are laser vaporization and chemical methods. Laser vaporization provides clusters with a remarkably uniform composition, which is advantageous for studying the effect of alloying on reactivity independently of any possible support effect. Chemical methods, on the other hand, are governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support, potentially leading to variations in the catalyst's composition. The paper demonstrates that the laser vaporization technique is effective in preparing bimetallic catalysts with well-defined compositions, suitable for testing their catalytic behavior in vapor-phase reactions like toluene hydrogenation.

最常使用的支持双金属催化剂合成方法是激光蒸发和化学方法。激光蒸发技术能够制备出具有均匀组成的小簇，这有利于独立研究合金化对活性的影响，而无需考虑任何可能的支持效应。化学方法则由前体在支撑物上的亲和力决定，可能导致催化剂组成的波动。论文证明，激光蒸发技术能够有效制备出具有明确组成的双金属催化剂，并适用于测试它们在如苯乙烯氢化等气相反应中的催化行为。
