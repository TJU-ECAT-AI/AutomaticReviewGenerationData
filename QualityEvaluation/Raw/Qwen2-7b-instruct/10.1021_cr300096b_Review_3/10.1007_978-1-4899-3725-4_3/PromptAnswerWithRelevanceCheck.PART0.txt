<Answer>

<quotes>
<p>Catalyst development is a process of evolution. Although cases differ, successful process implementation follows a series of logical steps. Each has well-defined objectives that require talents from established branches of science and engineering.</p>
<p>Commercialization may involve many passes through these steps, but every proven catalyst development has, in some fashion, progressed in this manner.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Catalyst development involves a series of logical steps aimed at achieving specific objectives, requiring expertise from various scientific and engineering disciplines. Successful processes typically follow a pattern of progression, often involving multiple iterations during commercialization.
