1. The literature does not provide specific details on how carbon-based materials such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, nor does it propose mechanisms or discuss influencing factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. Additionally, it does not explore the implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts.
