[1] "Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the use of CO2 as a milder and safer oxidant in the ODH of propane [6,7,16,20]."
[2] "It is worth noting that the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 can proceed by two different reaction pathways."
[3] "Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process, carbon dioxide can act as a diluent [27], which delivers the required heat and reduces coking of catalyst by coke gasification."
[4] "Our results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation of propane."

The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a mild and safer oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has gained interest due to its potential to improve efficiency while minimizing energy consumption. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 can occur through two pathways: a direct process where CO2 re-oxidizes the catalyst surface reduced by propane, and a two-step pathway involving simple dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. CO2 also acts as a diluent, providing heat and reducing catalyst deactivation by coke gasification. The creation and maintenance of metallic indium species on the catalyst surface are essential for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

在过去十年中，人们越来越关注在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中使用CO2作为更温和和更安全的氧化剂。这主要是由于它有可能提高效率并减少能量消耗。在CO2存在的条件下脱氢丙烷可以沿着两种不同的反应途径进行：直接过程，在此过程中CO2重新氧化由丙烷还原的催化剂表面，以及一个两步过程，包括简单脱氢随后是水煤气逆向反应。CO2还充当稀释剂，提供热量并减少催化剂失活的焦炭气化。在催化剂表面上创造和保持金属铟物种对于高效丙烷脱氢至关重要。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
