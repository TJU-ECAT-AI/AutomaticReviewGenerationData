1. The use of CO2 as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has gained attention due to its potential as a milder and safer alternative to molecular oxygen. CO2 can facilitate the dehydrogenation process through re-oxidizing the catalyst surface, thus enabling the formation of propylene. Moreover, CO2 can act as a diluent, providing heat and reducing the risk of catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation.

2. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 can occur via two pathways: a direct process where CO2 promotes dehydrogenation, and a two-step pathway involving simple dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Both mechanisms contribute to the formation of propylene.

3. Carbon dioxide acts as a diluent in the dehydrogenation process, delivering the required heat and mitigating the risks associated with using oxygen, such as flammability and the production of undesired carbon oxides. This facilitates the control of the reaction and enhances the selectivity of the process.

4. The creation and maintenance of metallic indium species on the catalyst surface at optimal concentrations are essential for achieving efficient propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. These active metallic indium species play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation performance.

1. 在过去十年中，CO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中的温和且更安全的氧化剂引起了广泛关注。CO2能够通过重新氧化催化剂表面来促进脱氢过程，从而形成丙烯。此外，CO2还可以作为稀释剂，提供所需的热量并减少由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活风险。

2. 丙烷在CO2存在的条件下进行脱氢可以通过两种途径：直接过程，其中CO2促进脱氢；以及一个两步过程，涉及简单的脱氢后跟随水煤气变换反应的逆反应。这两种机制都对丙烯的形成有所贡献。

3. 在脱氢过程中，二氧化碳作为一种稀释剂发挥作用，提供必要的热量并减轻使用氧气时遇到的问题，如可燃性、热去除和深度氧化，这些会降低产物选择性并难以控制。这有助于控制反应并增强过程的选择性。

4. 催化剂表面上金属铟物种的生成和维持在最佳浓度对于实现CO2存在下的高效丙烷脱氢至关重要。这些活性金属铟物种在脱氢性能中扮演着关键角色。
