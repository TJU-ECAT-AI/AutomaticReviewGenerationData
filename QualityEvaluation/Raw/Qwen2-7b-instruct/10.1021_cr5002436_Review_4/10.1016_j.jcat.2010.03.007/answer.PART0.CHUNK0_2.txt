The research focused on analyzing the effects of various factors on the performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation processes. It was discovered that carbon dioxide in the reaction mixture significantly increased the yield of propylene. In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides as catalysts, when combined with carbon dioxide, led to a notable modification in the surface properties and bulk dispersion of the In2O3 phase, enhancing the catalyst's reducibility. The creation of surface metallic indium species during the reaction proved essential for achieving high dehydrogenation performance. Carbon dioxide facilitated simple dehydrogenation through its coupling with the reverse water gas shift reaction. Additionally, the introduction of InAl mixed oxide as a new catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene was reported. The key to efficient propane dehydrogenation lies in maintaining an optimal concentration of catalytically active metallic indium species on the surface of the catalyst.
