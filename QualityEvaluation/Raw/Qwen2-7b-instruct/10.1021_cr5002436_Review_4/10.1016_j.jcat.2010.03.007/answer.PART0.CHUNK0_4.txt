The study demonstrates that binary In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides show synergistic effects in the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in the presence of CO2. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the combination of In2O3 and Al2O3 components leads to modifications in the surface properties and bulk dispersion of In2O3, enhancing its reducibility. Surface metallic indium species play a crucial role in the PDH performance. CO2 promotes the yield of propylene by facilitating simple dehydrogenation coupled with the reverse water gas shift reaction, as observed in the temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2.

研究表明，二元In2O3Al2O3混合氧化物在CO2存在的丙烷脱氢（PDH）催化性能中表现出协同效应。通过X射线衍射和X射线光电子能谱分析发现，In2O3和Al2O3成分的结合导致了In2O3表面特性和内部分散的显著改变，提高了其可还原性。表面金属铟物种在脱氢性能中起着关键作用。二氧化碳通过促进简单脱氢与逆水煤气变换反应的耦合，促进了丙烯的产率，这是基于二氧化碳与氢气的温度程序反应得出的结果。
