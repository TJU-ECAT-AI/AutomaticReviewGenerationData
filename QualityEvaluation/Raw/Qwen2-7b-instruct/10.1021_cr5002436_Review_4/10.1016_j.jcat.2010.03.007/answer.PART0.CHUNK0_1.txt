[1] "Among all the studied catalysts, supported gallium oxides have recently been recognized as one of the most promising materials due to their excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3- or Pt-based systems [7,2833]."
[2] "Very recently, we have demonstrated that Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides are highly active and stable catalysts for PDH in the presence of CO2 [25,26]."
[3] "Our results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "It is worth noting that the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 can proceed by two different reaction pathways. The first is a direct process, in which CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation through re-oxidizing the catalyst surface as reduced by propane."
[5] "The second one, known as a two-step pathway, is a simple dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [7,25,26]."

1. Gallium oxides are considered among the most promising materials due to their superior catalytic efficiency compared to traditional Cr2O3- or Pt-based systems in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

2. Recent findings show that the combination of gallium oxide and aluminium oxide (Ga2O3Al2O3) forms highly active and stable catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide.

3. Maintaining an optimal concentration of catalytically active metallic indium species on the surface is essential for an efficient propane dehydrogenation process.

4. In the presence of carbon dioxide, propane dehydrogenation can occur through two distinct pathways: a direct process where carbon dioxide re-oxidizes the catalyst surface, which was previously reduced by propane, and a two-step process involving simple dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

5. The dehydrogenation process of propane can be influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of different carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 镓氧化物被认为是极有前景的材料之一，在烷烃脱氢反应中，它们的催化效率远超传统的Cr2O3或Pt基系统。

2. 最近的研究表明，将镓氧化物和铝氧化物（Ga2O3Al2O3）混合形成高效且稳定的催化剂，用于丙烷在二氧化碳存在下的脱氢过程。

3. 维持表面催化剂活性金属铟物种的最优浓度对于实现高效的丙烷脱氢至关重要。

4. 在二氧化碳的存在下，丙烷脱氢可以通过两种不同的途径进行：一种是直接过程，其中二氧化碳通过重新氧化催化剂表面促进脱氢，该表面此前已被丙烷还原；另一种是一步脱氢后紧接着逆水煤气变换反应的过程。

5. 碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的效果受到温度、表面化学等因素的影响，这表明不同碳基材料在烷烃脱氢过程中具有显著的催化活性。
