[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes are of significant industrial importance."
[2] "Their activity in these reactions is shown to be dependent upon their structure, with different reaction temperatures yielding structurally different coke deposits."
[3] "Studies on CNFs confirm that carbonaceous materials act as catalysts in this reaction."
[4] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."
[5] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature."
[6] "In the low-temperature regime, where the coke consists of discrete molecular units and more amorphous carbon, the catalyst deactivates with time-on-stream with both yield and conversion decreasing."
[7] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[8] "In the high-temperature regime, where the coke consists of more extended and ordered carbon networks, very different catalytic behaviour is observed."
[9] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
[10] "The phenomenon of carbonaceous deposits providing, or enhancing, catalytic activity is not restricted to DH or ODH reactions."

1. Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique structures and surface chemistries. Factors such as temperature and the nature of the surface chemistry influence their activity.

2. The catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation is temperature-dependent. High temperatures lead to the formation of highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, while low temperatures result in less ordered, discrete molecular units.

3. Carbon nanofibers, when unfunctionalized, show almost identical activity to coked VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, confirming the catalytic role of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation.

4. The catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation is attributed to organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. These radicals may play a role in the reaction mechanism, especially considering the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

5. The phenomenon of carbon-based materials providing or enhancing catalytic activity extends beyond dehydrogenation reactions, encompassing hydrogenation, reduction, and other chemical transformations. This highlights the versatility and potential of carbon-based catalysts in various industrial processes.
