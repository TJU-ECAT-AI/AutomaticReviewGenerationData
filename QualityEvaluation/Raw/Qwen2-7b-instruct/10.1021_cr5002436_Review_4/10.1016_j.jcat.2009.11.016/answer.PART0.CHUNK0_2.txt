[1] "Highly ordered coke deposits are active for the dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[2] "The catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 has been evaluated at 723, 823, 873, 898, 923, 948 and 973 K."
[3] "Significantly, from between 80 and 110 min on stream at 973 K, selectivity, conversion and yield all remain constant and do not deactivate with increasing exposure to n-butane."
[4] "The activity of coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature."
[5] "At low reaction temperatures, e.g. 823 K, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network."
[6] "At high reaction temperatures, e.g. 973 K, much more extensive and highly ordered coke is deposited."
[7] "Relating the catalyst activity shown in Fig. 2, to the nature of the coke, clear trends are apparent."
[8] "Spectroscopic and microscopic techniques have identified two distinct categories of coke deposit over VOx/Al2O3."
[9] "CNFs can be considered as graphene sheets formed into conical sections."
[10] "Neither the CNFs nor the coked VOx/Al2O3 exhibit deactivation as a function of increasing exposure to n-butane."
