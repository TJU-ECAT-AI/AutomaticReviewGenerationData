[1] "Highly ordered coke deposits are active for the dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[2] "Their activity in these reactions is shown to be dependent upon their structure, with different reaction temperatures yielding structurally different coke deposits."
[3] "Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), among other techniques, has been applied to the characterisation of these deposits the first time this technique has been employed in coke studies."
[4] "Coke encapsulates the catalyst, preventing access to VOx sites, without a loss of activity."
[5] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."
[6] "Significantly, from between 80 and 110 min on stream at 973 K, selectivity, conversion and yield all remain constant and do not deactivate with increasing exposure to n-butane."
[7] "THz spectroscopy is shown to be a valuable new resource in the catalyst characterisation toolkit."
[8] "It is notable that commercially, alkane dehydrogenation also suffers from rapid deactivation at these lower reaction temperatures."
