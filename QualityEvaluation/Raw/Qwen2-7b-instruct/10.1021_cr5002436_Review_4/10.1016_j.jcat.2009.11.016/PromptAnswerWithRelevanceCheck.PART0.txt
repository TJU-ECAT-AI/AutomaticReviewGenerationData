[1] "In this work both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported carbon nanofibres (CNFs) are shown to be active for the dehydrogenation of butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen."
[2] "Their activity in these reactions is shown to be depen- dent upon their structure, with different reaction temperatures yielding structurally different coke deposits."
[3] "Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), among other techniques, has been applied to the characterisation of these deposits  the first time this technique has been employed in coke studies."
[4] "STudies on CNFs confirm that carbonaceous materials act as catalysts in this reaction."
[5] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."
[6] "The nature of the carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 during n-butane dehydrogenation shows a strong dependence on reaction temperature."
[7] "At high reaction temperatures highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydro- carbons encapsulate the catalyst particle."
[8] "At low reaction temperatures, e.g. 823 K, the coke is poorly ordered and not present as an extended, graphene-like network."
[9] "In the high-temperature regime, where the coke con- sists of more extended and ordered carbon networks, very different catalytic behaviour is observed."
[10] "Spectroscopic and microscopic techniques have identified two distinct categories of coke deposit over VOx/Al2O3, as described above."
[11] "Relating the catalyst activity shown in Fig. 2, to the nature of the coke, clear trends are apparent."
[12] "That a change in the catalytically active site has occurred is con- firmed by TEM data, which show that the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst parti- cles are encapsulated in carbon after reaction at 973 K."
[13] "It has been clearly demonstrated that highly ordered coke deposits are active for the dehydrogenation of n-butane."
[14] "This conclusion is confirmed by complementary studies on unfunctiona- lised CNFs which at 973 K demonstrate almost identical activity to coked VOx/Al2O3."
[15] "Deactivation of the reaction is not observed in the timescale investigated, in stark contrast to behaviour at lower temperatures where rapid deactivation occurs."
[16] "THz spectroscopy is shown to be a valuable new resource in the catalyst characterisation toolkit."
[17] "Such discrimination is difficult to achieve by other methods, and as such THz-TDS will likely play an increasingly important role in future studies."

1. Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This activity is attributed to their structure and the reaction conditions, such as temperature. High-temperature coke deposits form highly ordered, conducting networks that encapsulate the catalyst particle, enabling efficient dehydrogenation.

2. The catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions depends on their structure, which varies with the reaction temperature. High-temperature coke deposits consist of more extended and ordered carbon networks, while low-temperature coke is poorly ordered and consists of discrete molecular units.

3. The activity of coke deposits and carbon nanofibers towards n-butane dehydrogenation is almost identical, confirming their catalytic role. This activity is attributed to the presence of organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material, which may play a role in the reaction mechanism.

4. The phenomenon of carbonaceous deposits providing or enhancing catalytic activity is not limited to dehydrogenation reactions. It is also observed in hydrogenation reactions and catalytic reduction reactions in proto-stellar nebulae, suggesting a broad applicability of carbon-based catalysts.

5. THz spectroscopy serves as a valuable tool in catalyst characterization. It enables the differentiation between polyaromatic carbons based on their long-range order and conductivity, offering insights into the nature of the active carbonaceous material.

6. The observed catalytic activity and structural characteristics of carbon-based materials have significant implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, particularly for alkane dehydrogenation and other hydrogenation processes.

1. Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique structures and surface chemistries. Factors such as temperature and the nature of the surface chemistry influence their activity.

2. The catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation is temperature-dependent. High temperatures lead to the formation of highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, while low temperatures result in less ordered, discrete molecular units.

3. Carbon nanofibers, when unfunctionalized, show almost identical activity to coked VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, confirming the catalytic role of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation.

4. The catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation is attributed to organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. These radicals may play a role in the reaction mechanism, especially considering the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

5. The phenomenon of carbon-based materials providing or enhancing catalytic activity extends beyond dehydrogenation reactions, encompassing hydrogenation, reduction, and other chemical transformations. This highlights the versatility and potential of carbon-based catalysts in various industrial processes.
