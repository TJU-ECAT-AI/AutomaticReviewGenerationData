The iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia experience deactivation due to carbon deposition. Solid state reactions between the active phase and the support do not occur in these catalysts, resulting in the iron-containing phase transforming into Fe3O4 after the reaction. The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-supported catalysts containing only iron oxide, as determined through temperature-programmed oxidation, is approximately 2 wt% C after 20 hours. A carbon species deposited in narrow pores is present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts. The deactivation behavior is influenced by two processes: carbon deposition and the reduction of the supported iron oxide phase. The catalysts' performance is not affected by the type of catalyst support. The stability of the catalytic performance of zirconia-supported catalysts containing both iron and potassium is determined by adding potassium. The selectivity of the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts towards butadiene is relatively low, associated with a high production of carbon dioxide.

铁氧化物基催化剂在锆酸盐支持下，在操作过程中由于碳沉积而失活。在这些催化剂中，活性相和支撑相之间不会发生固态反应，反应后铁含相转变为Fe3O4。仅含有铁氧化物的锆酸盐支持催化剂上通过程序化氧化测定的总碳沉积量约为2 wt% C，在20小时后。在铁氧化物-锆酸盐催化剂中存在在狭窄孔中的碳物种。失活行为受到两个因素的影响：碳沉积和支撑铁氧化物相的还原。催化剂性能不受催化剂支持类型的影响。通过添加钾来确定包含铁和钾的锆酸盐支持催化剂的催化性能稳定性。Fe,K/ZrO2催化剂对丁二烯的选择性相对较低，与大量二氧化碳的产生有关。
