The document discusses how carbon-based materials, specifically coke deposits, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions when they are part of carbon-based catalysts. This phenomenon is influenced by several factors, including temperature and surface chemistry. The high CO2 production in these reactions is attributed to carbon deposition occurring in the narrow pores of zirconia-supported catalysts. The document suggests that eliminating the small pores through treatments like sintering or using alternative support materials can improve the selectivity towards butadiene, demonstrating the potential for developing more efficient carbon-based catalysts with optimized pore structures.

1. Iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia deactivate during operation due to carbon deposition. Solid state reactions between the active phase and the support do not take place in these catalysts. After the reaction, the iron-containing phase is Fe3O4. The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-supported catalysts is about 2 wt% C after 20 h. A carbon species deposited in narrow pores is present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts. KFe/ZrO2 catalysts are more stable than KFe/MgO catalysts, experiencing only a slight deactivation after about 100 h on stream. The high production of CO2 relates to the selectivity to butadiene of KFe/ZrO2 catalysts, which is about 60%. Eliminating the small pores significantly improves the butadiene selectivity.

1. 铁氧化物基催化剂在锆基质上的活性在运行过程中由于碳沉积而失效。在这些催化剂中，活性相和支撑相之间不会发生固态反应。反应后，铁含相变为Fe3O4。确定温度程序氧化后的总碳沉积量为2 wt% C在20 h后。铁氧化物-锆催化剂中存在在狭窄孔中沉积的碳物种。KFe/ZrO2催化剂比KFe/MgO催化剂更稳定，在约100 h的连续操作后只观察到轻微的失活。CO2的高产量与KFe/ZrO2催化剂的丁二烯选择性有关，约为60%。消除小孔显著提高了丁二烯的选择性。

2. The stability of the catalytic performance of the zirconia-supported catalysts containing both iron and potassium is influenced by the addition of potassium. The results show that there is no clear correlation between the iron and potassium loadings and the conversion of butene and the selectivity to butadiene. However, if the iron or potassium loading is below 1 wt%, the catalysts deactivate. This deactivation is attributed to carbon deposition, which is also observed with catalysts showing an inhomogeneous distribution of the iron/potassium phase after preparation. The coverage of the support surface with the iron oxide-potassium oxide phase plays a crucial part in catalyst stability. Potassium depletion causes the deactivation observed after long times-on-stream.

2. 锆基质上同时含有铁和钾的催化剂的催化性能稳定性受钾的添加影响。结果显示，铁和钾负载与丁二烯的转化率和丁二烯选择性的相关性不明显。然而，如果铁或钾负载低于1 wt%，催化剂会失效。这种失效被归因于碳沉积，这也是在准备后显示出铁/钾相分布不均的催化剂所观察到的现象。支持表面覆盖铁氧化物-钾氧化物相对催化剂稳定性起着关键作用。钾的流失导致在长时间操作后观察到的失效。

3. The carbon deposition on the catalysts is characterized by a steady increase with time-on-stream. The oxidation of the deposited carbon takes place in one step. However, the formation of carbon that cannot be easily oxidized, such as in the micropores of the catalyst, is detected. This carbon forms almost instantly, while the readily accessible carbon starts to accumulate after about 0.51 h. The onset temperature of oxidation shifts from about 250C for carbonaceous deposits resulting after shorter deposition times to 280C for coke oxidized after 16 h on stream.

3. 催化剂上的碳沉积随时间增长而持续增加。碳沉积的氧化发生在一步中。然而，无法轻易氧化的碳，如催化剂中的微孔中的碳，会被检测到。这种碳几乎立刻形成，而容易获得的碳在大约0.51 h后开始积累。氧化的起始温度从短沉积时间后形成的碳质沉积物的约250C，转变为在流操作16 h后氧化的焦炭的280C。

4. The temperature-programmed measurements and kinetic parameters for butene dehydrogenation over zirconia-supported Fe,K catalysts are determined. The obtained values show a scattering in the calculated activation energies of 6 kJ/mole above and below the average value of about 149 kJ/mole. The temperatures T40 are slightly higher than most temperatures reported by Stobbe et al. (about 590C), but are equal to the T40 values reported for the S-105 reference catalyst and the Fe,K/MgO catalyst which was exposed to atmospheric air. The calculations of the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor do not indicate the presence of diffusion limitations.

5. The presence of narrow pores may affect the coking and gasification properties of the catalysts. This was checked by testing a catalyst which was prepared using a support material which was precalcined at a substantially higher temperature, viz., 1100C prior to impregnation. The calculated micropore surface is reduced to about 0.8 m2/g, as opposed to about 3 m2/g for a support treated at 850C. The butene conversion and butadiene selectivity of this catalyst are plotted in Fig. 13.

Iron-Based Dehydrogenation Catalysts Supported on Zirconia
II. The Behavior in the Dehydrogenation of 1-Butene

L. A. Boot, A. J. van Dillen, J. W. Geus, and F. R. van Buren

Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Debye Institute, Utrecht University, P.O. Box 80083, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands; and Dow Benelux N.V., P.O. Box 48, 4530 AA Terneuzen, The Netherlands

Received August 15, 1995; revised June 7, 1996; accepted June 12, 1996

The behavior of iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene was investigated. Iron oxide- on-zirconia catalysts deactivate during operation due to carbon deposition.

It was shown with XRD that solid state reactions between the active phase and the support do not take place in the zirconia-supported catalysts: the iron-containing phase after reaction is Fe3O4.

The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-supported catalysts containing only iron oxide as determined with temperature-programmed oxidation is about 2 wt% C after 20 h.

A carbon species deposited in narrow pores was present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts.

The KFe/ZrO2 catalysts proved to be more stable than KFe/MgO catalysts: for catalysts containing highly dispersed iron oxide only a slight deactivation was observed after about 100 h on stream. This deactivation is attributed to migration of potassium from the catalyst to the quartz reactor.

Catalysts of low loadings (1 wt% Fe, 1 wt% K) or with less well-dispersed iron oxide deactivate in a shorter period of time: an incomplete coverage of the zirconia support leads to deactivation by carbon deposition.

The selectivity to butadiene of the KFe/ZrO2 catalysts is about 60%, which is related to a high production of CO2. This is attributed to carbon deposition taking place in the small pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts. Eliminating the small pores substantially improved the butadiene selectivity.

The first and principal property that is dealt with is the deactivation behavior of the Fe/ZrO2 and Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts. Subsequently the catalytic performance including the selectivity to butadiene is discussed. Also the deposition of carbon as a cause for deactivation is examined.

Finally, from temperature-programmed activity measurements kinetic parameters for butene dehydrogenation over zirconia-supported Fe,K catalysts are determined.

Catalyst Preparation
Catalysts were prepared according to procedures described previously (1).

Catalyst Characterization
X-ray diffraction.
Powder XRD was carried out with FeKα1, 2 radiation (1.93735 A) in a Philips powder diffrac-
tometer mounted on a Philips PW1140 X-ray generator.

Temperature-programmed oxidation.
Determination of the amount of deposited carbon was performed immediately after the test reaction by TPO using 5 v% O2 in N2 (50 ml/min). 

Catalyst Testing
Nonoxidative butene dehydrogenation was carried out in a semiautomated flow apparatus, as schematically represented in Fig. 1.

Calculations of the conversion, the selectivity to product i, and the yield of product i were carried out in the same manner as was done earlier (2, 4, 6).

The byproduct yields for a 3 wt% Fe/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 3. The butene conversion and butadiene selectivity for the bare support material are presented in Fig. 4.

Butene conversions and selectivities to butadiene as a function of time at 600C for iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts containing different amounts of iron are presented in Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively.

Iron Oxide-on-Zirconia Catalysts
As can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.55 h.

The type of catalyst support did not influence the catalytic properties of the Fe/ZrO2 system. The iron loading seems to affect the time required to complete the deactivation, but does not have a large effect on the overall catalytic behavior.

In Fig. 2b it can be seen that the initial selectivity towards butadiene formation is low, about 35 to 50%.

Effect of Addition of Potassium
To determine the stability of the catalytic performance of the zirconia-supported catalysts containing both iron and potassium, butene conversion and butadiene selectivity was monitored at 600C as a function of time-on-stream.

The results of the prolonged test presented in Fig. 7 show that with a catalyst containing 6% Fe and 9% K after about 100 h a small decrease of the conversion has occurred.

A remarkable difference with the (Fe,K) catalysts supported on magnesia or with the reference bulk iron oxide-based catalyst S-105 is the low selectivity toward the formation of 1,3-butadiene which is characteristic for the zirconia-supported catalysts.

Temperature-Programmed Measurements and Kinetic Parameters
Results of temperature-dependent measurements of butene conversion, butadiene selectivity and product yields for a Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Figs. 11 and 12.

From the temperature-dependent activity plots Arrhenius plots have been constructed and apparent activation energies for the dehydrogenation reaction have been calculated following the procedure described by Stobbe et al. (4, 6).

Transport Limitations
Calculations performed to determine the Thiele modulus 8s and effectiveness factor η did not indicate that diffusion limitations are present: η was estimated to be equal to unity for the zirconia-supported catalysts (13).

铁氧化物基催化剂在锆酸盐载体上的活性在丁烷脱氢过程中会由于碳沉积而失效。确定在20小时后，仅含铁氧化物的锆酸盐支持催化剂上沉积的碳总量约为2 wt% C。在铁氧化物-on-锆酸盐催化剂中发现了一种碳物种沉积在狭窄的孔中。KFe/ZrO2催化剂比KFe/MgO催化剂更稳定：对于含有高度分散的铁氧化物的催化剂，在大约100小时后只观察到轻微的降解。这种降解归因于从催化剂迁移到石英反应器中的钾。低负载量（1 wt% Fe，1 wt% K）或分散不良的铁氧化物催化剂在较短的时间内失效，由于覆盖不完整导致碳沉积导致催化剂失效。锆酸盐支持催化剂的低选择性是由于形成1,3-丁二烯的高二氧化碳生产率引起的，这归因于碳沉积在锆酸盐支持催化剂的小孔中。消除小孔显着提高了丁二烯的选择性。Fe/ZrO2和Fe,K/ZrO2催化剂的主要性能是其失效行为。讨论了催化剂的催化性能，包括丁二烯选择性。检查了碳沉积作为失效的原因。通过温度程序化活动测量确定了锆酸盐支持Fe,K催化剂的但烯脱氢反应的热力学参数。提供了催化剂制备和表征方法。3 wt% Fe/ZrO2催化剂的副产品产率图显示在图3中。图4中展示了裸支持材料的丁烷转化和丁二烯选择性。图7中呈现的结果表明，含有6% Fe和9% K的催化剂在大约100小时后，转换率略有下降。锆酸盐支持催化剂中形成的1,3-丁二烯选择性的低相关于高二氧化碳产量，这归因于碳沉积在锆酸盐支持催化剂的小孔中。消除小孔显着提高了丁二烯选择性。

The literature discusses the behavior of iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia during the dehydrogenation of 1-butene. The main finding is that these catalysts deactivate due to carbon deposition. The total amount of carbon deposition onto zirconia-supported catalysts, as determined with temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), is similar to that found with magnesia-supported catalysts. A carbon species is deposited in narrow pores of the catalysts. This carbon deposition leads to high CO2 production because it takes place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts. Removing these small pores through sintering treatments or using wide porous zirconia support materials significantly enhances the butadiene selectivity.

The iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia experience deactivation due to carbon deposition. Solid state reactions between the active phase and the support do not occur in these catalysts, resulting in the iron-containing phase transforming into Fe3O4 after the reaction. The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-supported catalysts containing only iron oxide, as determined through temperature-programmed oxidation, is approximately 2 wt% C after 20 hours. A carbon species deposited in narrow pores is present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts. The deactivation behavior is influenced by two processes: carbon deposition and the reduction of the supported iron oxide phase. The catalysts' performance is not affected by the type of catalyst support. The stability of the catalytic performance of zirconia-supported catalysts containing both iron and potassium is determined by adding potassium. The selectivity of the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts towards butadiene is relatively low, associated with a high production of carbon dioxide.

铁氧化物基催化剂在锆酸盐支持下，在操作过程中由于碳沉积而失活。在这些催化剂中，活性相和支撑相之间不会发生固态反应，反应后铁含相转变为Fe3O4。仅含有铁氧化物的锆酸盐支持催化剂上通过程序化氧化测定的总碳沉积量约为2 wt% C，在20小时后。在铁氧化物-锆酸盐催化剂中存在在狭窄孔中的碳物种。失活行为受到两个因素的影响：碳沉积和支撑铁氧化物相的还原。催化剂性能不受催化剂支持类型的影响。通过添加钾来确定包含铁和钾的锆酸盐支持催化剂的催化性能稳定性。Fe,K/ZrO2催化剂对丁二烯的选择性相对较低，与大量二氧化碳的产生有关。
