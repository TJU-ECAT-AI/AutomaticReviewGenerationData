The behavior of iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene was investigated. Iron oxide- on-zirconia catalysts deactivate during operation due to carbon deposition.

It was shown with XRD that solid state reactions between the active phase and the support do not take place in the zirconia-supported catalysts: the iron-containing phase after reaction is Fe3O4.

The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-supported catalysts containing only iron oxide as determined with temperature-programmed oxidation is about 2 wt% C after 20 h.

A carbon species deposited in narrow pores was present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts.

The KFe/ZrO2 catalysts proved to be more stable than KFe/MgO catalysts: for catalysts containing highly dispersed iron oxide only a slight deactivation was observed after about 100 h on stream. This deactivation is attributed to migration of potassium from the catalyst to the quartz reactor.

Catalysts of low loadings (1 wt% Fe, 1 wt% K) or with less well-dispersed iron oxide deactivate in a shorter period of time: an incomplete coverage of the zirconia support leads to deactivation by carbon deposition.

The selectivity to butadiene of the KFe/ZrO2 catalysts is about 60%, which is related to a high production of CO2. This is attributed to carbon deposition taking place in the small pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts. Eliminating the small pores substantially improved the butadiene selectivity.

The first and principal property that is dealt with is the deactivation behavior of the Fe/ZrO2 and Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts. Subsequently the catalytic performance including the selectivity to butadiene is discussed. Also the deposition of carbon as a cause for deactivation is examined.

Finally, from temperature-programmed activity measurements kinetic parameters for butene dehydrogenation over zirconia-supported Fe,K catalysts are determined.

Catalyst Preparation
Catalysts were prepared according to procedures described previously (1).

Catalyst Characterization
X-ray diffraction.
Powder XRD was carried out with FeKα1, 2 radiation (1.93735 A) in a Philips powder diffrac-
tometer mounted on a Philips PW1140 X-ray generator.

Temperature-programmed oxidation.
Determination of the amount of deposited carbon was performed immediately after the test reaction by TPO using 5 v% O2 in N2 (50 ml/min). 

Catalyst Testing
Nonoxidative butene dehydrogenation was carried out in a semiautomated flow apparatus, as schematically represented in Fig. 1.

Calculations of the conversion, the selectivity to product i, and the yield of product i were carried out in the same manner as was done earlier (2, 4, 6).

The byproduct yields for a 3 wt% Fe/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 3. The butene conversion and butadiene selectivity for the bare support material are presented in Fig. 4.

Butene conversions and selectivities to butadiene as a function of time at 600C for iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts containing different amounts of iron are presented in Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively.

Iron Oxide-on-Zirconia Catalysts
As can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.55 h.

The type of catalyst support did not influence the catalytic properties of the Fe/ZrO2 system. The iron loading seems to affect the time required to complete the deactivation, but does not have a large effect on the overall catalytic behavior.

In Fig. 2b it can be seen that the initial selectivity towards butadiene formation is low, about 35 to 50%.

Effect of Addition of Potassium
To determine the stability of the catalytic performance of the zirconia-supported catalysts containing both iron and potassium, butene conversion and butadiene selectivity was monitored at 600C as a function of time-on-stream.

The results of the prolonged test presented in Fig. 7 show that with a catalyst containing 6% Fe and 9% K after about 100 h a small decrease of the conversion has occurred.

A remarkable difference with the (Fe,K) catalysts supported on magnesia or with the reference bulk iron oxide-based catalyst S-105 is the low selectivity toward the formation of 1,3-butadiene which is characteristic for the zirconia-supported catalysts.

Temperature-Programmed Measurements and Kinetic Parameters
Results of temperature-dependent measurements of butene conversion, butadiene selectivity and product yields for a Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Figs. 11 and 12.

From the temperature-dependent activity plots Arrhenius plots have been constructed and apparent activation energies for the dehydrogenation reaction have been calculated following the procedure described by Stobbe et al. (4, 6).

Transport Limitations
Calculations performed to determine the Thiele modulus 8s and effectiveness factor η did not indicate that diffusion limitations are present: η was estimated to be equal to unity for the zirconia-supported catalysts (13).

铁氧化物基催化剂在锆酸盐载体上的活性在丁烷脱氢过程中会由于碳沉积而失效。确定在20小时后，仅含铁氧化物的锆酸盐支持催化剂上沉积的碳总量约为2 wt% C。在铁氧化物-on-锆酸盐催化剂中发现了一种碳物种沉积在狭窄的孔中。KFe/ZrO2催化剂比KFe/MgO催化剂更稳定：对于含有高度分散的铁氧化物的催化剂，在大约100小时后只观察到轻微的降解。这种降解归因于从催化剂迁移到石英反应器中的钾。低负载量（1 wt% Fe，1 wt% K）或分散不良的铁氧化物催化剂在较短的时间内失效，由于覆盖不完整导致碳沉积导致催化剂失效。锆酸盐支持催化剂的低选择性是由于形成1,3-丁二烯的高二氧化碳生产率引起的，这归因于碳沉积在锆酸盐支持催化剂的小孔中。消除小孔显着提高了丁二烯的选择性。Fe/ZrO2和Fe,K/ZrO2催化剂的主要性能是其失效行为。讨论了催化剂的催化性能，包括丁二烯选择性。检查了碳沉积作为失效的原因。通过温度程序化活动测量确定了锆酸盐支持Fe,K催化剂的但烯脱氢反应的热力学参数。提供了催化剂制备和表征方法。3 wt% Fe/ZrO2催化剂的副产品产率图显示在图3中。图4中展示了裸支持材料的丁烷转化和丁二烯选择性。图7中呈现的结果表明，含有6% Fe和9% K的催化剂在大约100小时后，转换率略有下降。锆酸盐支持催化剂中形成的1,3-丁二烯选择性的低相关于高二氧化碳产量，这归因于碳沉积在锆酸盐支持催化剂的小孔中。消除小孔显着提高了丁二烯选择性。
