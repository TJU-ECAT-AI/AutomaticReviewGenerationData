1. Iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia deactivate during operation due to carbon deposition. Solid state reactions between the active phase and the support do not take place in these catalysts. After the reaction, the iron-containing phase is Fe3O4. The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-supported catalysts is about 2 wt% C after 20 h. A carbon species deposited in narrow pores is present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts. KFe/ZrO2 catalysts are more stable than KFe/MgO catalysts, experiencing only a slight deactivation after about 100 h on stream. The high production of CO2 relates to the selectivity to butadiene of KFe/ZrO2 catalysts, which is about 60%. Eliminating the small pores significantly improves the butadiene selectivity.

1. 铁氧化物基催化剂在锆基质上的活性在运行过程中由于碳沉积而失效。在这些催化剂中，活性相和支撑相之间不会发生固态反应。反应后，铁含相变为Fe3O4。确定温度程序氧化后的总碳沉积量为2 wt% C在20 h后。铁氧化物-锆催化剂中存在在狭窄孔中沉积的碳物种。KFe/ZrO2催化剂比KFe/MgO催化剂更稳定，在约100 h的连续操作后只观察到轻微的失活。CO2的高产量与KFe/ZrO2催化剂的丁二烯选择性有关，约为60%。消除小孔显著提高了丁二烯的选择性。

2. The stability of the catalytic performance of the zirconia-supported catalysts containing both iron and potassium is influenced by the addition of potassium. The results show that there is no clear correlation between the iron and potassium loadings and the conversion of butene and the selectivity to butadiene. However, if the iron or potassium loading is below 1 wt%, the catalysts deactivate. This deactivation is attributed to carbon deposition, which is also observed with catalysts showing an inhomogeneous distribution of the iron/potassium phase after preparation. The coverage of the support surface with the iron oxide-potassium oxide phase plays a crucial part in catalyst stability. Potassium depletion causes the deactivation observed after long times-on-stream.

2. 锆基质上同时含有铁和钾的催化剂的催化性能稳定性受钾的添加影响。结果显示，铁和钾负载与丁二烯的转化率和丁二烯选择性的相关性不明显。然而，如果铁或钾负载低于1 wt%，催化剂会失效。这种失效被归因于碳沉积，这也是在准备后显示出铁/钾相分布不均的催化剂所观察到的现象。支持表面覆盖铁氧化物-钾氧化物相对催化剂稳定性起着关键作用。钾的流失导致在长时间操作后观察到的失效。

3. The carbon deposition on the catalysts is characterized by a steady increase with time-on-stream. The oxidation of the deposited carbon takes place in one step. However, the formation of carbon that cannot be easily oxidized, such as in the micropores of the catalyst, is detected. This carbon forms almost instantly, while the readily accessible carbon starts to accumulate after about 0.51 h. The onset temperature of oxidation shifts from about 250C for carbonaceous deposits resulting after shorter deposition times to 280C for coke oxidized after 16 h on stream.

3. 催化剂上的碳沉积随时间增长而持续增加。碳沉积的氧化发生在一步中。然而，无法轻易氧化的碳，如催化剂中的微孔中的碳，会被检测到。这种碳几乎立刻形成，而容易获得的碳在大约0.51 h后开始积累。氧化的起始温度从短沉积时间后形成的碳质沉积物的约250C，转变为在流操作16 h后氧化的焦炭的280C。

4. The temperature-programmed measurements and kinetic parameters for butene dehydrogenation over zirconia-supported Fe,K catalysts are determined. The obtained values show a scattering in the calculated activation energies of 6 kJ/mole above and below the average value of about 149 kJ/mole. The temperatures T40 are slightly higher than most temperatures reported by Stobbe et al. (about 590C), but are equal to the T40 values reported for the S-105 reference catalyst and the Fe,K/MgO catalyst which was exposed to atmospheric air. The calculations of the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor do not indicate the presence of diffusion limitations.

4. 对锆基质上Fe,K催化剂的丁二烯脱氢的温度程序测量和动力学参数进行确定。获得的值显示计算活化能的散列在平均值约149 kJ/mole的上下各有6 kJ/mole。T40的温度略高于Stobbe等人报告的大多数温度（约590C），但与参考催化剂S-105和暴露于大气空气的Fe,K/MgO催化剂的T40值相同。Thiele模数和效率因子的计算没有表明存在扩散限制。

5. The presence of narrow pores may affect the coking and gasification properties of the catalysts. This was checked by testing a catalyst which was prepared using a support material which was precalcined at a substantially higher temperature, viz., 1100C prior to impregnation. The calculated micropore surface is reduced to about 0.8 m2/g, as opposed to about 3 m2/g for a support treated at 850C. The butene conversion and butadiene selectivity of this catalyst are plotted in Fig. 13.
