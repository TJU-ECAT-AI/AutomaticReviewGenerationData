The literature discusses the behavior of iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia during the dehydrogenation of 1-butene. The main finding is that these catalysts deactivate due to carbon deposition. The total amount of carbon deposition onto zirconia-supported catalysts, as determined with temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), is similar to that found with magnesia-supported catalysts. A carbon species is deposited in narrow pores of the catalysts. This carbon deposition leads to high CO2 production because it takes place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts. Removing these small pores through sintering treatments or using wide porous zirconia support materials significantly enhances the butadiene selectivity.

文献研究了铁氧化物基催化剂在1-丁烯脱氢反应中的行为。主要发现是这些催化剂在操作过程中由于碳沉积而失效。用温度程序氧化（TPO）确定的锆支持催化剂上的总碳沉积量与镁支持催化剂相似。在催化剂中发现了碳物种沉积在狭窄的孔中。这种碳沉积导致高二氧化碳产量，因为它是发生在锆支持催化剂的狭窄孔中。通过高温烧结处理或使用宽孔锆支持材料去除这些小孔可以显著提高丁二烯选择性。
