[1] "Iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia deactivate during operation due to carbon deposition."
[2] "The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-supported catalysts containing only iron oxide as determined with temperature-programmed oxidation is about 2 wt% C after 20 h."
[3] "A carbon species deposited in narrow pores was present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts."
[4] "The origin of the high CO2 production lies in the fact that carbon deposition is taking place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts."
[5] "Eliminating the small pores by sintering treatments at high temperatures (or, e.g., by using sinter aids or by using wide porous zirconia support materials) substantially improves the butadiene selectivity."

The document discusses how carbon-based materials, specifically coke deposits, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions when they are part of carbon-based catalysts. This phenomenon is influenced by several factors, including temperature and surface chemistry. The high CO2 production in these reactions is attributed to carbon deposition occurring in the narrow pores of zirconia-supported catalysts. The document suggests that eliminating the small pores through treatments like sintering or using alternative support materials can improve the selectivity towards butadiene, demonstrating the potential for developing more efficient carbon-based catalysts with optimized pore structures.

文档讨论了当碳基材料，特别是焦炭沉积物，作为碳基催化剂的一部分时，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性的现象。这一现象受多种因素的影响，包括温度和表面化学。这些反应中高CO2的产生被归因于碳沉积发生在锆基催化剂的小孔中。文档建议通过烧结处理或使用其他支撑材料来消除小孔可以显著提高向丁二烯的选择性，这表明有可能开发出具有优化孔结构的更高效的碳基催化剂。
