<p>According to the literature, the ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites occurs significantly easier on Zn2+ ions located in the vicinity of two Al centers. This is due to the presence of a second Al center that ensures basic O center at an appropriate distance, facilitating the interaction with one of the H atoms of ethane. On the other hand, on Zn species close to isolated Al centers, stable spectator species ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ are formed, which hinder further catalytic reactions due to the high energetic barriers on subsequent stages of the dehydrogenation process.</p>
<p>The computational model study suggests that the reaction occurs faster on Zn2+ ions located near two Al centers, highlighting the crucial role of the second Al center for ethane dehydrogenation.</p>

The ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites proceeds more efficiently when the Zn2+ ions are located close to two Al centers. The presence of the second Al center facilitates the reaction by providing a basic O center at the right distance to interact with one of the H atoms of ethane. In contrast, on Zn species situated near isolated Al centers, the formation of stable spectator species such as ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ blocks further catalytic reactions due to the high energy barriers encountered in subsequent stages of the dehydrogenation process. Computational evidence indicates that the reaction rate is significantly faster when Zn2+ ions are present near two Al centers, underscoring the pivotal role of the second Al center in this catalytic mechanism.

在Zn,H-ZSM-5沸石上，乙烷脱氢在两个Al中心附近的Zn2+离子附近进行得更有效。第二个Al中心的存在促进了反应，因为它提供了一个位于与乙烷中的一个H原子交互的适当距离的基本O中心。相反，在孤立的Al中心附近的Zn物种中，稳定观察到的物种如ZnH+或Zn(C2H5)+的形成阻止了进一步的催化反应，因为后续阶段遇到了过高的能量壁垒。计算证据表明，当两个Al中心附近存在Zn2+离子时，反应速率显著更快，强调了第二个Al中心在这一催化机制中的关键作用。
