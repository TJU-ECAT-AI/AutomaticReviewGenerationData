[1] "Ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 was modeled by density functional calculations on isolated zeolite fragment. Three types of cationic Zn species, that are assumed to exist in the samples prepared by ion exchange, were considered as active sites for the process: Zn2+ in the vicinity of paired Al centers as well as ZnOH+ and ZnH+ in the vicinity of one isolated Al site."
[2] "The second transition state TSA2 of the synchronic mechanism A is late, i.e. its enthalpy and structure are closer to the intermediate IA and the produced ethene (Tables 1 and 2)."
[3] "The only transition state that is not included in the mechanisms A and B is TSC (for b-transfer), which is considerably less stable, DH = 272 kJ/mol (Table 2), than the transitions states described above."
[4] "The transition state TSD1 of mechanism D has low relative enthalpy, 117 kJ/mol, while the enthalpy of the second transition state TSX2 is significant, 254 kJ/mol (Table 2)."
[5] "The Gibbs free energy of the corresponding transition states as function of temperature for the mechanisms AC on Z2/Zn2+ catalytic center are displayed in the upper panel of Fig. 7."
[6] "The only stages which can concur with processes on the bare Zn2+ ions located at paired Al sites are TSD1 and TSX2 (283 and 278 kJ/ mol at 800 K) leading to formation of Z1/Zn(C2H5)+ or Z1/ZnH+ complexes."
[7] "The formation of stable species ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ on zinc species close to isolated Al center is in good agreement with experimental study of Kazansky and Pidko [12]."

<p>According to the literature, the ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites occurs significantly easier on Zn2+ ions located in the vicinity of two Al centers. This is due to the presence of a second Al center that ensures basic O center at an appropriate distance, facilitating the interaction with one of the H atoms of ethane. On the other hand, on Zn species close to isolated Al centers, stable spectator species ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ are formed, which hinder further catalytic reactions due to the high energetic barriers on subsequent stages of the dehydrogenation process.</p>
<p>The computational model study suggests that the reaction occurs faster on Zn2+ ions located near two Al centers, highlighting the crucial role of the second Al center for ethane dehydrogenation.</p>

The ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites proceeds more efficiently when the Zn2+ ions are located close to two Al centers. The presence of the second Al center facilitates the reaction by providing a basic O center at the right distance to interact with one of the H atoms of ethane. In contrast, on Zn species situated near isolated Al centers, the formation of stable spectator species such as ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ blocks further catalytic reactions due to the high energy barriers encountered in subsequent stages of the dehydrogenation process. Computational evidence indicates that the reaction rate is significantly faster when Zn2+ ions are present near two Al centers, underscoring the pivotal role of the second Al center in this catalytic mechanism.

在Zn,H-ZSM-5沸石上，乙烷脱氢在两个Al中心附近的Zn2+离子附近进行得更有效。第二个Al中心的存在促进了反应，因为它提供了一个位于与乙烷中的一个H原子交互的适当距离的基本O中心。相反，在孤立的Al中心附近的Zn物种中，稳定观察到的物种如ZnH+或Zn(C2H5)+的形成阻止了进一步的催化反应，因为后续阶段遇到了过高的能量壁垒。计算证据表明，当两个Al中心附近存在Zn2+离子时，反应速率显著更快，强调了第二个Al中心在这一催化机制中的关键作用。

The extensive experimental [2,7,911] studies of these zeolites have suggested that depending on the method for preparation of the samples several types of Zn-containing cationic species might exist and/or act as active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane or propane.

There are also several computational studies of the reaction mechanism. In an early investigation, Frash and van Santen [26] modeled ethane dehydrogenation on Zn2+ located at four- membered ring and showed that the dissociation of the ethane molecule to carbanion C2H5 and H+ is energetically more favorable compared to the alternative carbenium mechanism via dissociation to C2H5 + and H.

The second stage, b-transfer of hydride anion from the CH3 group to the Zn center resulting in formation of C2H4 and ZnH+ species has apparent activation barrier (energy of the transition state,calculated with respect to the reactants) of 65 kJ/mol, while the final step recombination and desorption of H2, has high apparent activation energy, above 200 kJ/mol [28], since the regeneration of the catalytic site results in formation of one uncompensated Al center.

According to Iglesia and co-workers, the role of Zn species in the catalytic process is facilitation of the recombination and desorp- tion of H2 from the catalytic site [1,3].

By IR spectroscopy Kazansky and Pidko [12] established formation of ethanide Zn(C2H5)+ species and restoration of bridging OH groups after heating the sample

In absence of a second Al center close to the zinc species (as in the models with isolated Al sites) the reaction is blocked due to formation of rather stable intermediates ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ that cannot be decomposed due to the too high activation barriers on the next stages of the dehydrogenation process.

The calculations also highlight the essential role of the second Al center in vicinity of the zinc cation for the reaction since it generates basic framework oxygen center participating in the reaction steps with lowest activation barrier.

The second Al center ensure not only basic O center for initial cleavage of CH bond, but also bridging OH group, which interacts with ethanide anion in the second stage.

The role of zinc species in the catalytic process of transforming light alkanes into valuable products such as alkenes, aromatic compounds, and hydrogen through Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite is facilitated by their ability to assist in the recombination and desorption of hydrogen. After heating the sample, ethanide Zn(C2H5)+ species and restoration of bridging OH groups are formed. Several computational studies have also explored the reaction mechanism. The second transition state involves the b-transfer of a hydride anion from the CH3 group to the zinc center, forming C2H4 and ZnH+ species with an activation barrier of 65 kJ/mol. The final step of recombination and desorption of hydrogen has a high activation energy, over 200 kJ/mol. The presence of a second aluminum center near the zinc cation plays a crucial role in the reaction, generating a basic oxygen center that participates in the steps with the lowest activation barrier. Without a second aluminum center close to the zinc species, the reaction is blocked due to the formation of stable intermediates such as ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+, which cannot be decomposed due to the excessively high activation barriers on subsequent dehydrogenation stages.

锌物种在将轻烷烃转化为有价值的产物，如烯烃、芳香化合物和氢气的过程中，通过Zn,H-ZSM-5沸石催化作用的关键是它们能够促进氢的再组合和脱附。加热样品后，会形成乙基锌(C2H5)+物种以及桥接羟基的恢复。已经进行了多个计算研究来探索反应机制。第二个过渡态涉及从CH3组转移到锌中心的氢离子的b转移，形成C2H4和ZnH+物种，其活化势垒为65 kJ/mol。最终步骤的再组合和脱附氢具有超过200 kJ/mol的高活化能。在锌离子附近存在的第二个铝中心在反应中起着关键作用，产生参与活化势最低步骤的基本氧中心。如果没有第二个铝中心靠近锌物种，则反应被阻断，由于后续脱氢过程中的极高的活化势垒而形成的稳定中间体，如ZnH+或Zn(C2H5)+无法分解。
