The role of zinc species in the catalytic process of transforming light alkanes into valuable products such as alkenes, aromatic compounds, and hydrogen through Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite is facilitated by their ability to assist in the recombination and desorption of hydrogen. After heating the sample, ethanide Zn(C2H5)+ species and restoration of bridging OH groups are formed. Several computational studies have also explored the reaction mechanism. The second transition state involves the b-transfer of a hydride anion from the CH3 group to the zinc center, forming C2H4 and ZnH+ species with an activation barrier of 65 kJ/mol. The final step of recombination and desorption of hydrogen has a high activation energy, over 200 kJ/mol. The presence of a second aluminum center near the zinc cation plays a crucial role in the reaction, generating a basic oxygen center that participates in the steps with the lowest activation barrier. Without a second aluminum center close to the zinc species, the reaction is blocked due to the formation of stable intermediates such as ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+, which cannot be decomposed due to the excessively high activation barriers on subsequent dehydrogenation stages.

锌物种在将轻烷烃转化为有价值的产物，如烯烃、芳香化合物和氢气的过程中，通过Zn,H-ZSM-5沸石催化作用的关键是它们能够促进氢的再组合和脱附。加热样品后，会形成乙基锌(C2H5)+物种以及桥接羟基的恢复。已经进行了多个计算研究来探索反应机制。第二个过渡态涉及从CH3组转移到锌中心的氢离子的b转移，形成C2H4和ZnH+物种，其活化势垒为65 kJ/mol。最终步骤的再组合和脱附氢具有超过200 kJ/mol的高活化能。在锌离子附近存在的第二个铝中心在反应中起着关键作用，产生参与活化势最低步骤的基本氧中心。如果没有第二个铝中心靠近锌物种，则反应被阻断，由于后续脱氢过程中的极高的活化势垒而形成的稳定中间体，如ZnH+或Zn(C2H5)+无法分解。
