The extensive experimental [2,7,911] studies of these zeolites have suggested that depending on the method for preparation of the samples several types of Zn-containing cationic species might exist and/or act as active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane or propane.

There are also several computational studies of the reaction mechanism. In an early investigation, Frash and van Santen [26] modeled ethane dehydrogenation on Zn2+ located at four- membered ring and showed that the dissociation of the ethane molecule to carbanion C2H5 and H+ is energetically more favorable compared to the alternative carbenium mechanism via dissociation to C2H5 + and H.

The second stage, b-transfer of hydride anion from the CH3 group to the Zn center resulting in formation of C2H4 and ZnH+ species has apparent activation barrier (energy of the transition state,calculated with respect to the reactants) of 65 kJ/mol, while the final step recombination and desorption of H2, has high apparent activation energy, above 200 kJ/mol [28], since the regeneration of the catalytic site results in formation of one uncompensated Al center.

According to Iglesia and co-workers, the role of Zn species in the catalytic process is facilitation of the recombination and desorp- tion of H2 from the catalytic site [1,3].

By IR spectroscopy Kazansky and Pidko [12] established formation of ethanide Zn(C2H5)+ species and restoration of bridging OH groups after heating the sample

In absence of a second Al center close to the zinc species (as in the models with isolated Al sites) the reaction is blocked due to formation of rather stable intermediates ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ that cannot be decomposed due to the too high activation barriers on the next stages of the dehydrogenation process.

The calculations also highlight the essential role of the second Al center in vicinity of the zinc cation for the reaction since it generates basic framework oxygen center participating in the reaction steps with lowest activation barrier.

The second Al center ensure not only basic O center for initial cleavage of CH bond, but also bridging OH group, which interacts with ethanide anion in the second stage.

The document discusses the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The document mentions that the catalytic activity is influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. The document provides insights into the proposed mechanisms of alkane dehydrogenation, including the role of zinc-containing cationic species in facilitating the recombination and desorption of hydrogen from the catalytic site. It also highlights the importance of the second aluminum center in proximity to the zinc ion for the dehydrogenation process. The document suggests that the presence of the second aluminum center ensures the formation of a basic oxygen center that interacts with hydrogen atoms in the reaction steps with the lowest activation barrier. This facilitates the formation of alkenes from alkanes. The document also mentions that the presence of a second aluminum center ensures not only the basic oxygen center for the initial cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen bond but also a bridging hydroxyl group that interacts with the ethanide anion in the second stage of the reaction.
