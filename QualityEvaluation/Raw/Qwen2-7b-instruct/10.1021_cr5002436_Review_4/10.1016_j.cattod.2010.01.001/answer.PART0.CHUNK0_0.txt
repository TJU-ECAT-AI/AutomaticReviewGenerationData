[1] "Ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 was modeled by density functional calculations on isolated zeolite fragment. Three types of cationic Zn species, that are assumed to exist in the samples prepared by ion exchange, were considered as active sites for the process: Zn2+ in the vicinity of paired Al centers as well as ZnOH+ and ZnH+ in the vicinity of one isolated Al site."
[2] "The second transition state TSA2 of the synchronic mechanism A is late, i.e. its enthalpy and structure are closer to the intermediate IA and the produced ethene (Tables 1 and 2)."
[3] "The only transition state that is not included in the mechanisms A and B is TSC (for b-transfer), which is considerably less stable, DH = 272 kJ/mol (Table 2), than the transitions states described above."
[4] "The transition state TSD1 of mechanism D has low relative enthalpy, 117 kJ/mol, while the enthalpy of the second transition state TSX2 is significant, 254 kJ/mol (Table 2)."
[5] "The Gibbs free energy of the corresponding transition states as function of temperature for the mechanisms AC on Z2/Zn2+ catalytic center are displayed in the upper panel of Fig. 7."
[6] "The only stages which can concur with processes on the bare Zn2+ ions located at paired Al sites are TSD1 and TSX2 (283 and 278 kJ/ mol at 800 K) leading to formation of Z1/Zn(C2H5)+ or Z1/ZnH+ complexes."
[7] "The formation of stable species ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ on zinc species close to isolated Al center is in good agreement with experimental study of Kazansky and Pidko [12]."

1. Three types of cationic Zn species were considered as active sites for ethane dehydrogenation: Zn2+ near paired Al centers, and ZnOH+ and ZnH+ near isolated Al sites.
2. The second transition state of the synchronic mechanism A has an enthalpy and structure closer to the intermediate IA and the produced ethene.
3. The transition state TSC, involving b-transfer, is considerably less stable than other transition states.
4. The transition state TSD1 of mechanism D has a lower relative enthalpy, while the second transition state TSX2 has a significantly higher enthalpy.
5. The Gibbs free energy of transition states varies with temperature for the mechanism on Z2/Zn2+.
6. TSD1 and TSX2 lead to the formation of Zn(C2H5)+ or ZnH+ complexes on bare Zn2+ ions at paired Al sites.
7. The formation of stable ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ species on zinc species close to isolated Al centers aligns with experimental findings by Kazansky and Pidko.

1. 假设存在于离子交换样品中的三种锌阳离子物种被考虑作为烷基化过程的活性位点：配对Al中心附近的Zn2+，以及单个孤立Al位点附近的ZnOH+和ZnH+。
2. 同步机制A的第二个过渡态的焓和结构更接近中间体IA和生成的乙烯。
3. 转换状态TSC（涉及b转移）的稳定性远低于其他转换状态。
4. 机制D的过渡状态TSD1具有较低的相对焓，而第二个过渡状态TSX2具有显著更高的焓。
5. 温度变化下，Z2/Zn2+机制中过渡态的吉布斯自由能会变化。
6. TSD1和TSX2导致在配对Al位点的裸Zn2+离子上形成Zn(C2H5)+或ZnH+复合物。
7. 在孤立Al中心附近的锌物种中形成稳定ZnH+或Zn(C2H5)+物种与Kazansky和Pidko的实验结果一致。
