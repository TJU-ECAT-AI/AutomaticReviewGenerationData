<p>One of the perspective catalysts for the transformation of light alkanes in more valuable products as alkenes, aromatic compounds and hydrogen is Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite [18]. The extensive experimental [2,7,911] studies of these zeolites have suggested that depending on the method for preparation of the samples several types of Zn-containing cationic species might exist and/or act as active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane or propane.</p>
<p>According to Iglesia and co-workers, the role of Zn species in the catalytic process is facilitation of the recombination and desorption of H2 from the catalytic site [1,3]. By IR spectroscopy Kazansky and Pidko [12] established formation of ethanide Zn(C2H5)+ species and restoration of bridging OH groups after heating the sample.</p>
<p>There are also several computational studies of the reaction mechanism. In an early investigation, Frash and van Santen [26] modeled ethane dehydrogenation on Zn2+ located at four- membered ring and showed that the dissociation of the ethane molecule to carbanion C2H5 and H+ is energetically more favorable compared to the alternative carbenium mechanism via dissociation to C2H5 + and H.</p>
<p>In the present investigation we modeled the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on cationic Zn-containing species located close to isolated and paired Al sites, which could exist in pores of Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange technique.</p>

The document discusses the catalytic activity of Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The catalyst is effective because it facilitates the recombination and desorption of hydrogen. Several types of Zn-containing species can act as active sites for dehydrogenation. Computational studies show that the dissociation of ethane into carbanion and H+ is energetically favorable. The mechanism involves interactions with isolated and paired Al sites within the zeolite structure.
