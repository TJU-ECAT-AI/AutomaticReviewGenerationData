[1] "The catalytic properties of framework iron-containing zeolites were investigated using the monomolecular propane reaction. It was shown that the reaction proceeds with very high dehydrogenation selectivity and occurs via isolate framework Fe sites. The measured TOFs per framework iron atom were the same for the samples with different Si/Fe ratios (15, 26, and 48)."
[2] "Because there is an 8090% decrease in reaction rates over the sodium-exchanged samples, it is concluded that framework Fe sites were the sites responsible for catalysis."
[3] "The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 also showed lower reaction rates than those for H-[Fe]ZSM-5, indicating that the Fe sites isolated in the framework are the main channel for propane conversion on H-[Fe] zeolites."
[4] "Active sites in both framework and extra-framework positions showed very high dehydrogenation selectivity and low activation energies compared with those for H-[Al]ZSM-5."
[5] "These results indicate that a reaction mechanism different from proton donation from the acid site, that is, a redox reaction mechanism, could explain the observed properties of H-[Fe] zeolites."
[6] "The spontaneous formation of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe] zeolites at room temperature supports the notion that H-[Fe]-zeolites have redox properties that can lead to catalytic reactivity."

The catalytic activity of framework iron-containing zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation reactions is characterized by high dehydrogenation selectivity. This selectivity occurs via isolated iron sites within the zeolite framework. The study found that the catalytic sites responsible for the reaction are the framework iron atoms, despite similar TOFs per iron atom across samples with varying Si/Fe ratios. Sodium-exchanged samples showed significantly reduced reaction rates, indicating that the framework iron sites play a crucial role in the propane conversion process. The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 also exhibited lower reaction rates compared to H-[Fe]ZSM-5, highlighting the importance of isolated framework iron sites. Both framework and extra-framework iron sites demonstrated high dehydrogenation selectivity and low activation energies, suggesting a redox reaction mechanism rather than proton donation. The spontaneous formation of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe] zeolites supports the redox properties of these materials, contributing to their catalytic reactivity.

框架铁基沸石的研究显示，在烷烃脱氢反应中，其催化活性表现出极高的脱氢选择性。这种选择性通过沸石框架内的孤立铁位点发生。研究发现，催化反应的关键位点是框架中的铁原子，尽管不同Si/Fe比样品中的TOF/铁原子相似。交换钠的样品显示出显著降低的反应速率，表明框架铁位点在丙烷转化过程中起关键作用。蒸煮的[Fe]ZSM-5也比H-[Fe]ZSM-5的反应速率更低，强调了框架内孤立铁位点的重要性。框架内外的铁位点均表现出高脱氢选择性和低活化能，暗示了一种不同于酸位点捐赠的氧化还原反应机制。吸附在H-[Fe]沸石上的萘自由基的自发形成支持了这些材料的氧化还原性质，从而促进了它们的催化活性。
