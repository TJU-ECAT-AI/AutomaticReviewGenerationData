[1] "The strength of acid sites can be measured using heats of adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile."
[2] "Conversion of small alkanes has been used frequently as a model reaction because the cleavage of CC and CH bonds in hydrocarbons is a problem of fundamental scientific interest."
[3] "The redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."
[4] "The measurement of catalytic rates was carried out using a quartz tube reactor (ID = 5 mm)."
[5] "The reaction rates and product distribution reported here were collected after this initial deactivation period."
[6] "The catalytic reactions of propane were measured for the acid form of [Fe] zeolites with Si/Fe ratios of 15,26,and 48 (H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26), H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48), H-[Fe]beta (15)) and an Arrhenius plot was used to compare the reaction rates over the various iron-silicate zeolites."
[7] "The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 sample showed 2 to 3 times higher reaction rates (0.28 mol s1 g cat1  107 at 773 K) than Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 (0.11 mol s1 g cat1  107 at 773 K), but showed only about 1/4 of the rate for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (1.16 mol s1 g cat1  107 at 773 K)."
[8] "It is concluded that H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has multiple active sites, consisting of Fe sites isolated in the framework and Fe species in extra-framework positions (both in and outside the zeolite pores)."
[9] "The reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 1 is suggested for the propane reaction over framework Fe sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]beta."

1. The strength of acid sites can be assessed by measuring the heats of adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile. Small alkane conversion is often used as a model reaction due to its fundamental scientific significance in cleaving CC and CH bonds in hydrocarbons.
2. A redox catalytic cycle is proposed for hydrocarbon reactions on isolated iron framework sites in iron-silicate zeolites, involving the formation of propane radical cations. A protolytic mechanism does not adequately explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity.
3. The catalytic rates were measured using a quartz tube reactor with an internal diameter of 5 mm.
4. The initial deactivation period occurred before the collection of reaction rates and product distributions reported in the study.
5. The reaction rates for various iron-silicate zeolites with different Si/Fe ratios were compared using an Arrhenius plot.
6. The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 sample demonstrated significantly higher reaction rates than the Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 sample, but lower rates than the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 sample.
7. H-[Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites possess multiple active sites, comprising isolated iron sites within the framework and iron species in extra-framework positions.
8. The suggested reaction mechanism for propane reactions on framework iron sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]beta zeolites involves the formation of propane radical cations.

1. 强酸位点的强度可以通过测量氨、吡啶和乙腈等碱的吸附热来评估。小烷烃的转换经常被用作模型反应，因为它在氢化物中切割CC和CH键具有基础科学意义。
2. 在铁硅酸盐沸石的框架铁位点上进行的烃类反应被假设为通过形成丙烷自由基离子的还原氧化催化循环进行，这解释了激活能和选择性之间观察到的差异。纯解离机制无法解释这些差异。
3. 使用直径为5mm的石英管反应器测量了催化速率。
4. 在报告的研究中收集的反应速率和产物分布是在初始失活期之后。
5. 对不同Si/Fe比例的铁硅酸盐沸石的各种样品进行了反应速率比较，并使用阿伦尼乌斯图进行分析。
6. 蒸煮的[Fe]ZSM-5样品的反应速率高于Na-[Fe]ZSM-5样品，但低于H-[Fe]ZSM-5样品。
7. H-[Fe]ZSM-5沸石含有多个活性位点，包括框架内的孤立铁位点和额外框架位置的铁物种。
8. 建议的反应机制涉及在H-[Fe]ZSM-5和H-[Fe]beta沸石上的框架铁位点上进行的丙烷反应，导致形成丙烷自由基离子。
