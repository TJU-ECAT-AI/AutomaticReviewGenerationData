[1] "It was also reported that isomerization of m-xylene is catalyzed by BAS in Fe-containing zeolites, and the conversion rates and selectivity are comparable to those exhibited by H-[Al] zeolites [10,11]."
[2] "The strength of acid sites can be measured using heats of adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile."
[3] "The results suggest that a redox mech- anism is a plausible explanation for the hydrocarbon conversion on [Fe] zeolites reported here, as had been hypothesized earlier for Al-containing zeolites [20,21]."
[4] "A previous report also showed enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity and lower apparent activation energies for thermally dehydroxylated H-[Al]ZSM-5 compared to H-[Al]ZSM-5 [20]."
[5] "The reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 1 is suggested for the propane reaction over framework Fe sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]beta. An electron is extracted from the propane molecule at the framework Fe site when the propane contacts the sites, and a propane radical cation is formed."

1. It is reported that isomerization of m-xylene can be catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites containing iron, with similar conversion rates and selectivity to those observed in zeolites with aluminum.

2. The strength of acid sites can be assessed through the heats of adsorption of bases like ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile.

3. The data suggests that a redox mechanism might explain the hydrocarbon conversion on iron-containing zeolites, as proposed earlier for zeolites with aluminum.

4. A previous study demonstrated increased dehydrogenation selectivity and lower apparent activation energies for thermally dehydroxylated aluminum-containing zeolites compared to the original ones.

5. A reaction mechanism is proposed for propane reactions over iron sites in the framework of zeolites, involving electron extraction from propane, leading to the formation of a propane radical cation.

1. 已报道，甲基环己烯的异构化可以通过铁含量沸石中的Brnsted酸中心催化，其转化率和选择性与含铝沸石类似。

2. 酸中心的强度可以通过吸附氨、吡啶和乙腈等碱类物质的热值来衡量。

3. 数据表明，一个还原氧化机制可能解释铁基沸石中的烃类转换现象，这与之前对含铝沸石的假设一致。

4. 一项先前的研究显示，热脱水处理后的铝基沸石在脱氢选择性和显热激活能方面表现出增强，相比原状沸石。

5. 对于含铁沸石中丙烷反应的机制提出了一种描述，涉及从丙烷分子中提取电子至铁位点，形成丙烷自由基阳离子。
