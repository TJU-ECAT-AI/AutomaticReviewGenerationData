[1] "It was also reported that isomerization of m-xylene is catalyzed by BAS in Fe-containing zeolites, and the conversion rates and selectivity are comparable to those exhibited by H-[Al] zeolites [10,11]."
[2] "Conversion of small alkanes has been used frequently as a model reaction because the cleavage of CC and CH bonds in hydrocarbons is a problem of fundamental scientific interest."
[3] "The monomolecular alkane reaction proceeds throughonly two reaction channels: cracking and dehydrogenation."
[4] "In contrast,dehydrogenation selectivity is enhanced (cracking- to-dehydrogenation ratio 1) in H-[Al]ZSM-5 after thermal dehydr- oxylation [20]."
[5] "The higher dehydrogenation rates and lower apparent activation energy are interpreted as indicating that a different reaction mechanism for hydrocarbon conversion is operative in these samples."
[6] "This reaction mechanism is similar to that introduced for a thermally dehydroxylated catalyst in a previous report [20]."

1. The isomerization of m-xylene is catalyzed by BAS in Fe-containing zeolites, with conversion rates and selectivity comparable to those of H-[Al] zeolites.
2. Conversion of small alkanes is often used as a model reaction due to its fundamental scientific interest in the cleavage of CC and CH bonds in hydrocarbons.
3. The monomolecular alkane reaction consists of only two pathways: cracking and dehydrogenation.
4. After thermal dehydration, dehydrogenation selectivity in H-[Al]ZSM-5 increases, achieving a cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio of 1.
5. The higher dehydrogenation rates and lower apparent activation energy in iron-silicate zeolites suggest a distinct reaction mechanism for hydrocarbon conversion.
6. The suggested reaction mechanism is akin to that described for a thermally dehydroxylated catalyst in a prior study.

1. m-二甲苯的异构化在铁基沸石中由BAS催化，其转化率和选择性与H-[Al]沸石相似。
2. 小烷烃的转换常被用作模型反应，因为它涉及到烃类中CC和CH键的断裂，这是基础科学的一个重要问题。
3. 单分子烷烃反应只涉及两个途径：裂解和脱氢。
4. 在热脱水后，H-[Al]ZSM-5中的脱氢选择性增加，达到裂解比脱氢为1的比率。
5. 铁硅酸盐沸石中的更高脱氢速率和更低显热能表明存在不同的烃类转换机制。
6. 提议的反应机制类似于先前研究中描述的热脱水催化剂的机制。
