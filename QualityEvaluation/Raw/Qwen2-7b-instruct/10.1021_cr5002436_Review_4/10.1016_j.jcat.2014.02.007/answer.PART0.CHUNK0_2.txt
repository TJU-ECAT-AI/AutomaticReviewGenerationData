The catalytic properties of iron-silicate zeolites were studied using the monomolecular propane reaction. It was found that the reaction proceeds with high dehydrogenation selectivity and occurs via isolated framework iron sites. The measured turnover frequencies (TOFs) per framework iron atom were the same across samples with different Si/Fe ratios. The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 showed lower reaction rates than H-[Fe]ZSM-5, suggesting that the isolated iron sites in the framework are the primary channel for propane conversion. Active sites in both the framework and extra-framework positions demonstrated high dehydrogenation selectivity and low activation energies compared to H-[Al]ZSM-5. These findings suggest that a redox reaction mechanism might explain the observed properties of H-[Fe] zeolites, as evidenced by the spontaneous formation of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe] zeolites.

对铁硅酸盐沸石的催化性质进行了研究，使用单分子丙烷反应。发现反应以高脱氢选择性进行，并通过框架中孤立的铁位点发生。测量到每框架铁原子的周转频率（TOFs）在不同Si/Fe比的样品中相同。蒸煮后的[Fe]ZSM-5的反应速率低于H-[Fe]ZSM-5，表明框架中的孤立铁位点是H-[Fe]沸石中丙烷转化的主要通道。框架内外活性位点显示了与H-[Al]ZSM-5相比，高脱氢选择性和低活化能。这些结果表明，红氧化学反应机制可能解释H-[Fe]沸石的观察性质，如室温下吸附于H-[Fe]沸石上的萘酚自由基离子的自发形成。
