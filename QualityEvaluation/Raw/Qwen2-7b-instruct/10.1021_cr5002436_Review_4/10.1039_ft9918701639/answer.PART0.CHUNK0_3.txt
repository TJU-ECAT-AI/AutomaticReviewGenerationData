The literature indicates that the activation energy for the dehydrogenation of but-1-ene to buta-1,3-diene is approximately 47 kcal/mol under minimal deactivation conditions. As the catalyst undergoes prolonged deactivation, this energy decreases to around 40 kcal/mol. The undecorated magnesium oxide (MgO) support material exhibits a notably higher activation energy of 65 kcal/mol. Upon carbon deposition or coking, the activation energy drops to approximately 51 kcal/mol. The differences between the coked MgO and the coked iron oxide catalyst suggest that the carbon deposited on both materials is of distinct nature.

文献表明，在最小化失活的情况下，脱氢生成丁-1-烯到丁-1,3-二烯的活化能约为47 kcal/mol。随着催化剂经历长时间的失活，该能量降低至约40 kcal/mol。未修饰的镁氧化物（MgO）支持材料显示出显著更高的活化能，为65 kcal/mol。在碳沉积或焦化后，活化能下降至约51 kcal/mol。对已焦化的MgO和已焦化的铁氧化物催化剂之间的差异的分析表明，沉积在两种材料上的碳具有不同的性质。
