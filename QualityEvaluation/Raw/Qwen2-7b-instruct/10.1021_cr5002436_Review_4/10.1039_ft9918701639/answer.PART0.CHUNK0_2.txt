The catalytic behaviour of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide in the non-oxidative dehydroge- nation of but-1-ene to buta-l,3-diene has been studied. Under dehydrogenation conditions the magnesium ferrite phase of the fresh catalyst was found to be reduced to FeO in the bulk of the ferrite particles, where FeO is strongly stabilized by the formation of a solid solution with MgO. At the surface of the particles magnesium ferrite is reduced to F e , O , .

In the reduced state a catalyst containing ca. 3 wt.% Fe shows a but-1-ene conver- sion of 26% combined with a buta-1,3-diene selectivity of 65% at 873 K. The activation energy for dehydroge- nation was found to be 47 kcal mol-'.The (unpromoted) catalyst gradually deactivates owing to carbon deposition. Under dehydrogenation condi- tions the catalyst surface is completely covered by a layer of amorphous carbon within 20 h.

The activity and selectivity of the catalysts as a function of the time on stream were measured. Phase changes within the catalysts, which are expected to occur during dehydroge- n a t i  n ,  . have been examined using magnetic measurements and X-ray diffraction.

The amount of carbon deposited seems to be more or less independent of the catalyst loading. The rather low values of the carbon content found for the catalysts containing ca. 3 wt.% Fe cannot be readily accounted for.

Several authors have reported the formation of carbon on unpromoted iron oxide in butene atmospheres. Therefore, the deactivation is expected to be caused by carbon deposition.

Carbon deposition or coking can lead to both pore blocking and covering of sites that are active for the dehydrogenation.

Under conditions where deactivation is minimized, an acti- vation energy for dehydrogenation to buta-1,3-diene of ca. 47 kcal mol- was found. After prolonged deactivation the acti- vation energy decreased to ca. 40 kcal mol-. The MgO support material initially shows a high activation energy of 65 kcal mol-. After coking the activation energy decreased to ca. 51 kcal mol-. The difference between the value for coked MgO and the value for the coked iron oxide catalyst suggests that that the carbon deposited on both materials is of a different nature.

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon is influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. The proposed mechanisms involve carbon's ability to cover active sites on catalyst surfaces, leading to both pore blocking and site covering. The catalytic activity of carbon-based materials is often dependent on the nature of the carbon deposit. In the study, carbon deposition on iron oxide catalysts resulted in a gradual deactivation, with an activation energy for dehydrogenation to buta-1,3-diene of approximately 47 kcal mol-. After prolonged deactivation, the activation energy decreased to around 40 kcal mol-. This difference suggests that the carbon deposited on iron oxide catalysts has a distinct nature compared to carbon deposited on MgO support materials, which initially showed a higher activation energy of 65 kcal mol-. The implications of this phenomenon are significant for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, offering potential improvements in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

各种碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳，出乎意料地在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出催化活性。这种现象受到诸如温度和表面化学等因素的影响。提出的机制涉及碳覆盖催化剂表面活性位点的能力，导致孔堵塞和位点覆盖。碳基材料的催化活性往往取决于沉积碳的性质。在研究中，铁氧化物催化剂上的碳沉积导致了逐渐失活，脱氢到丁-1,3-二烯的活化能约为47 kcal mol-。在长时间失活后，活化能降至约40 kcal mol-。这表明铁氧化物催化剂上沉积的碳与MgO支持材料上的沉积碳具有不同的性质。初始时，MgO支持材料显示出更高的活化能65 kcal mol-。在碳化后，活化能降低至约51 kcal mol-。这一差异表明，铁氧化物催化剂上的沉积碳与MgO支持材料上的沉积碳具有不同性质。这一现象对于开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义，为改进烷烃脱氢过程提供了潜力。
