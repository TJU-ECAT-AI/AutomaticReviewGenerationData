1. The thickness of the trough infilling beneath Managua was determined to be about 1.4 km. The compressional wave velocity in the material is 2.6 km/sec, and the shear wave velocity is 1.3 km/sec. The difference in elevation between the trough floor and the western wall reaches nearly 1 km near Managua.
2. Approximately ten aftershocks large enough to be felt in Managua occurred during the 20-day period covered by the report.
3. Two clusters of aftershocks can be distinguished within the distribution of epicenters, as shown in Figure 2. The directions of fault movements responsible for the aftershocks can be deduced from the first motions of recorded seismic waves.
4. Aftershocks are concentrated at depths between 2 and 8 km, with a few reaching 14 km deep and 1 km shallow.
5. It is concluded that the aftershock clusters define two steeply dipping faults, each about 10 km long and 10 to 15 km vertically extensive, indicating left lateral movement at the time of fieldwork.
6. The source mechanism of the Managua earthquake aligns with the inferred plate movements, suggesting that the large-scale tectonic processes forming the Nicaragua Trough are still active, leading to a high probability of future earthquakes in the Managua region.

1. 瓜纳瓜火山口填充物的厚度为1.4公里左右。该区域的压缩波速度为2.6公里/秒，剪切波速度为1.3公里/秒。火山口底部与西墙之间的高差接近1公里。
2. 在报告覆盖的20天期间，大约有10次足以在马那瓜感觉到的余震发生。
3. 图2中可以区分出两个余震震中的集群。根据记录地震波的第一运动方向，可以推断出导致余震的断层运动方向。
4. 余震集中在深度在2到8公里之间，有少数达到14公里深和1公里浅。
5. 结论是，余震簇定义了两个陡峭倾斜的断层或断层系统，每个大约10公里长和10至15公里垂直范围，表明断层运动导致了1973年曼加拉地震。
6. 曼加拉地震的源机制与推断的板块运动相吻合，这表明形成尼加拉瓜槽的大规模构造过程仍然活跃，导致马那瓜地区未来地震的可能性很高。
