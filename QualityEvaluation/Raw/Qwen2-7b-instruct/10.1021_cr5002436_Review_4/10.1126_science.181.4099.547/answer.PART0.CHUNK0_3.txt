1. The seismic signals from the two explosions in Lake Managua helped determine that the trough infilling is about 1.4 km thick beneath Managua. The compressional wave velocity in the material is 2.6 km/sec, and the shear wave velocity is 1.3 km/sec. The difference in elevation between the present trough floor and the top of the western wall near Managua is nearly 1 km.
2. During the 20-day period covered by the report, the number of aftershocks varied between 50 and 200 per day, with approximately ten of these being strong enough to be felt in Managua.
3. A total of 300 aftershocks have been located using the velocity model derived from the two explosions. Two clusters of aftershocks can be identified within their epicenter distribution.
4. The directions of fault movements causing aftershocks can be deduced from the initial seismic wave motions. The planes of the active zones are essentially vertical.
5. It was concluded that the aftershock clusters define two steeply dipping faults or fault systems, each about 10 km long and 10 to 15 km vertically extensive, where left lateral movement occurred.
6. The stress system affecting the area is explained by the differential movements between the Cocos plate on the west and the Caribbean plate on the east of Nicaragua.
7. The hypothesis suggests that the Caribbean plate is moving eastward, dragging eastern Nicaragua with it, while the Cocos plate moves northward, plunging beneath the western edge of the Central American Arc.
8. The probability of future earthquakes in the Managua region is considered high.
9. A reconstructed city in the area must be built to withstand moderate-intensity earthquakes.

1. 从拉瓜迪亚湖的两次爆炸的地震信号中，我们确定了曼纳瓜下方的洼地填充物厚度约为1.4公里。材料中的压缩波速度为2.6公里/秒，剪切波速度为1.3公里/秒。现洼地底部与西部墙壁顶部之间的高度差在曼纳瓜附近接近1公里。
2. 在报告覆盖的20天期间，每天的余震数量在50至200次之间波动，大约有十次余震足以感受到曼纳瓜。
3. 使用从两次爆炸推导出的速度模型，总共定位了300个余震。余震分布中有两个明显的簇群。
4. 从记录的地震波初始运动方向可以推断导致余震的断层运动方向。活跃区域的平面基本上是垂直的。
5. 我们得出结论，余震簇定义了两条或多个断层系统，每条长约10公里，垂直深度在10到15公里之间，当时发生了左向滑动。
6. 影响该地区的应力系统可以解释为西尼加拉瓜的科科斯板块和东尼加拉瓜的加勒比板块之间的差异运动。
7. 按照莫兰和西克斯（6）的假设，加勒比板块目前向东移动，“拖着”尼加拉瓜东部地区一起移动，而科科斯板块则向北移动，潜入中美洲弧西侧边缘之下。
8. 曼纳瓜地区未来发生地震的可能性被认为很高。
9. 在现在曼纳瓜废墟上重建的城市必须能够承受中等强度的地震。
