[1] "The number of aftershocks detected during the 20-day period covered by this report (10 to 29 January 1973) varied between 50 and 200 per day."
[2] "The magnitudes of these earthquakes ranged between 0.0 and 3.0."
[3] "Approximately ten aftershocks large enough to be felt in Managua occurred during this period."
[4] "Using the velocity model derived from the two explosions described above, we have located 300 aftershocks to date."
[5] "Two clusters can be distinguished within the distribution of aftershock epicenters."
[6] "The directions of the fault movements responsible for the aftershocks can be deduced from the directions of the first motions of the recorded seismic waves."
[7] "The planes of the active zones are essentially vertical."
[8] "We concluded that the aftershock clusters define two steeply dipping faults, or systems of faults, each about 10 km in length and 10 to 15 km in vertical extent, along which left lateral movement was taking place at the time of our fieldwork."
[9] "A system of crustal stresses compatible with the inferred directions of faulting is north-south compression and east-west tension."
[10] "This stress system may be explained as a consequence of differential movements between two plates: the Cocos plate on the western side of Nicaragua and the Caribbean plate on the eastern side."
[11] "There are several indications in the literature (1-3) that addition of carbon to nonnoble metals (such as Mo and W) confers to them some of the catalytic properties typical of the noble metals (such as Pt and Pd)."
[12] "For example, a study of the reaction of 1,1,3-trimethyl-cyclopentane in the presence of metal films (Fe, Co, Ni, W, Rh, Pt, and Pd) showed that only platinum rearranged the reactant to appreciable amounts of xylene (1)."

The document does not provide specific information regarding the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. It mentions studies indicating that adding carbon to non-noble metals such as molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) can confer some of the catalytic properties typical of noble metals like platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd). However, it does not detail the mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), or implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts.

The document focuses on a geological study related to aftershocks following an earthquake in the Managua region. It discusses the number of aftershocks, their magnitudes, locations, and the inferred plate movements that contribute to the stress system causing the earthquakes. The document also provides details on the directions and depths of the aftershocks, concluding that they are associated with two steeply dipping fault systems responsible for left lateral movement. Furthermore, it suggests that the stress system might be due to differential movements between two plates, specifically the Cocos and Caribbean plates.

Unfortunately, the provided information does not allow for a detailed analysis of the catalytic properties of carbon-based materials or their applications in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

文档没有提供关于各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出的意外催化活性的具体信息。它提到了一些研究表明，向钼（Mo）和钨（W）等非贵金属添加碳可以赋予它们与铂（Pt）和钯（Pd）等贵金属类似的催化性质。然而，它没有详细说明这些机制、影响因素（如温度和表面化学），或这种现象对新型高效碳基催化剂发展的意义。

文档关注的是曼加纳地区地震后余震的研究。它讨论了余震的数量、大小、位置以及导致地震的推断板块运动，从而形成引起地震的应力系统。此外，文档还提供了关于余震方向和深度的细节，并得出结论称，这些余震与两个倾斜的断层系统相关联，这些断层系统负责进行横向移动。进一步地，文档表明该应力系统可能是两个板块之间差异移动的结果，具体为哥斯达黎加板块和加勒比板块之间的移动。

遗憾的是，提供的信息不足以进行详细的分析，以了解碳基材料的催化性质及其在烷烃脱氢反应中的应用。
