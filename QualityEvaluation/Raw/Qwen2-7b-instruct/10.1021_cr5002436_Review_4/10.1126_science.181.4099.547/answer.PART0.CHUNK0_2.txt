The magnitudes of the aftershocks detected varied between 0.0 and 3.0. A total of 300 aftershocks have been located using a velocity model derived from the explosions in Lake Managua. The directions of the fault movements responsible for the aftershocks can be deduced from the directions of the first motions of the recorded seismic waves. The same stress system observed following an earthquake in Costa Rica, 235 km southeast of Managua, suggests that the same stress system may persist over a region including most of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

震后余震的震级范围在0.0至3.0之间。使用从马那瓜湖的两次爆炸推导出的速度模型，已定位到300个余震。根据记录的地震波的第一运动方向，可以推断出导致余震的断层运动的方向。哥斯达黎加距离马那瓜以南235公里处发生的地震后分析的相同应力分布表明，该应力系统可能在包括尼加拉瓜和哥斯达黎加在内的区域持续存在。
