1. We determined the thickness of the trough infilling to be about 1.4 km beneath Managua. The compressional wave velocity in the material is 2.6 km/sec, and the shear wave velocity is 1.3 km/sec. The difference in elevation between the present trough floor and the top of the western wall reaches nearly 1 km near Managua.

2. Approximately ten aftershocks large enough to be felt in Managua occurred during the period covered by this report.

3. Two clusters can be distinguished within the distribution of aftershock epicenters, as shown in Fig. 2.

4. The directions of the fault movements responsible for the aftershocks can be deduced from the directions of the first motions of the recorded seismic waves.

5. The aftershocks are concentrated at depths of between 2 and 8 km, with a few as deep as 14 km and as shallow as 1 km.

6. We concluded that the aftershock clusters define two steeply dipping faults, or systems of faults, each about 10 km in length and 10 to 15 km in vertical extent, along which left lateral movement was taking place at the time of our fieldwork.

7. The stress system may be explained as a consequence of differential movements between two plates: the Cocos plate on the western side of Nicaragua and the Caribbean plate on the eastern side.

1. 我们确定了曼加瓜下方填埋区的厚度约为1.4公里。材料中的压缩波速度为2.6公里/秒，剪切波速度为1.3公里/秒。现在槽底与西壁顶部之间的高差接近1公里。

2. 在本报告覆盖的期间，大约有十次足以在马那瓜感觉到的余震发生。

3. 在余震震中分布图中，可以区分出两个群集，如图2所示。

4. 可以从记录的地震波首次运动的方向推断出导致余震的断层运动的方向。

5. 余震集中在2到8公里深的范围内，有些深度可达14公里，最浅的深度为1公里。

6. 我们得出结论，余震群定义了两条或系统的陡倾断层，每条长约10公里，垂直范围约10至15公里，沿这些断层发生了左向滑动。

7. 这个应力系统可能解释为两块板块之间的相对移动的结果：尼加拉瓜西部的科科斯板块和东部的加勒比海板块。
