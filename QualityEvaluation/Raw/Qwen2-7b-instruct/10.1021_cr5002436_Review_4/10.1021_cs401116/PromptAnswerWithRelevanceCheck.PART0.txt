The Zn/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by the method of strong electrostatic adsorption. The hydroxyl groups on SiO2 are weakly acidic with a point of zero charge, or isoelectric point, of pH 4. Thus, in basic aqueous solution, the hydroxyl groups are deprotonated, resulting in a negatively charged support surface. Because of the strong Coulombic attraction between the support and the Zn cation precursor, addition of the tetraaminezinc(II) nitrate solution gives an equilibrium zinc coverage of 1.2 Zn2+/nm2. The amine ligands are subsequently removed by the subsequent thermal treatment to give 3.9% Zn on SiO2 by weight on the high-surface-area silica.

Catalytic Performance: Propylene Hydrogenation and Propane Dehydrogenation Catalytic rates of propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation on the silica-supported Zn catalysts are presented in Table 1. The Zn/SiO2 displays catalytic hydrogenation activity at temperatures above about 150 C. The results presented in Table 1 for propylene hydrogenation at 200 C were determined under differential conversion of 8.2%. Under these conditions, the SiO2 support is unreactive. During the 16-h test period, there is little deactivation, as the steady-state conversion after 12 h is 97% that of the initial conversion. No products other than propane were observed.

Catalyst Structure: X-ray Absorption and Raman Spectroscopy The oxidation state and coordination geometry of the active site was investigated using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) edge energies, presented in Table 2 and Figure 2a,c, were recorded under the reaction conditions and at lower temperature after reaction. The XANES energy of the catalyst is similar to the reference compounds of ZnO and Zn acetate, consistent with Zn(II) ions. Furthermore, over a range of conditions, the XANES shape (figure 2c) and edge energies (Table 2) remain unchanged, suggesting that the Zn oxidation state does not change during reaction.

This study reports the highly selective (more than 95%) dehydrogenation of propane to propylene as well as the reverse hydrogenation reaction by silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst. The catalyst is thermally stable at dehydrogenation temperature (550 C and above), and catalytic byproducts are small. In situ UV-resonance Raman, XANES, and EXAFS spectra reveal that tetrahedrally coordinated Zn(II) ions are chemisorbed into the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface. Under reaction conditions, the Zn(II) ion loses one ZnO bond, resulting in a coordinatively unsaturated, 3-coordinate active center. The infrared spectrum of adsorbed pyridine indicates that these are Lewis acid sites. Theoretical calculations based on hybrid density functional theory suggest that the catalyst activates HH and CH bonds by a nonredox (metal) mechanism consisting of heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds, in contrast with the homolytic mechanisms such as oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathways.
</quotes>

Answer: This study demonstrates that a silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst can selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene and reversibly hydrogenate propylene. The catalyst is thermally stable at high temperatures, enabling efficient dehydrogenation while minimizing byproducts. The active site involves tetrahedrally coordinated Zn(II) ions chemisorbed onto the silica surface, which lose one ZnO bond to create a 3-coordinate, coordinatively unsaturated active center. This center facilitates the heterolytic cleavage of alkane and olefin bonds through a non-redox mechanism, distinct from homolytic pathways. The use of theoretical calculations supports the proposed mechanism, highlighting the catalyst's ability to selectively activate bonds for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

In this paper, we report the synthesis of a silica-supported, single-site Zn(II) catalyst that is catalytically active for propylene hydrogenation and highly selective for the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. Raman spectroscopy indicates that the Zn(II) cation selectively reacts with 3-membered siloxane rings on silica to stabilize the single site structure. Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the initial coordination geometry was found to have four ZnO bonds. Under reaction conditions, there is loss of one ZnO bond, giving 3-coordinate Zn site that is the unsaturated, active zinc site without a change in the Zn(II) oxidation state.

Answer: We have developed a silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst that efficiently catalyzes propylene hydrogenation and shows high selectivity for the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the Zn(II) cation specifically interacts with three-membered siloxane rings on silica to maintain the single-site structure. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis shows that the initial coordination geometry features four ZnO bonds. Upon reaching reaction conditions, one ZnO bond is lost, resulting in a 3-coordinate Zn site, which is the unsaturated, active zinc site without altering the Zn(II) oxidation state. This unique structure enables efficient and selective catalysis for both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

This study introduces a silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst capable of selectively converting propane to propylene and vice versa. Under specific conditions, the Zn(II) ion loses a ZnO bond, creating a 3-coordinate active center that facilitates the reactions. The catalyst demonstrates high selectivity, with nearly every Zn(II) ion being equally active until poisoned by Lewis bases, which removes one active site per adsorbed poison. The catalyst's synthesis enables its use in propylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation, with Raman spectroscopy showing the Zn(II) ion binds to 3-membered siloxane rings on the silica surface. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the initial coordination geometry has four ZnO bonds, which reduce to a 3-coordinate active center upon reaction. Infrared spectroscopy confirms the Lewis acid nature of the active sites. Density functional theory calculations propose a reaction pathway involving heterolytic bond dissociation for alkane dehydrogenation and olefin hydrogenation, followed by β hydride elimination at the Zn(II) site, explaining the high selectivity observed in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
