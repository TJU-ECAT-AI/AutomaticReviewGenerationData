<p>Because hydrogenation catalysis is well-behaved, we surmised that Zn/SiO2 might catalyze alkane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The thermal stability of Zn/SiO2 allows it to be employed as an alkane dehydrogenation catalyst at temperatures where the reaction becomes thermodynamically favorable (T > 550 C).</p>
<p>At 550 C, gas-phase thermal cracking is small, and the Zn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits >95% selectivity to propylene and hydrogen throughout the course of the reaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the catalyst is active for several hours, with the rate decreasing to 50% of the initial conversion after 12 h.</p>
<p>At 650 C, where significant contribution from thermal cracking was observed, the catalytic dehydrogenation selectivity remained high at 95% propylene.</p>

This study reports the highly selective (more than 95%) dehydrogenation of propane to propylene as well as the reverse hydrogenation reaction by silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst. The catalyst is thermally stable at dehydrogenation temperature (550 C and above), and catalytic byproducts are small. Under reaction conditions, the Zn(II) ion loses one ZnO bond, resulting in a coordinatively unsaturated, 3-coordinate active center. The catalyst activates HH and CH bonds by a nonredox (metal) mechanism consisting of heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds, in contrast with the homolytic mechanisms such as oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathways. The computed minority catalytic pathway consists of undesired CC bond cleavage at Zn(II) site, follows a slightly different mechanism, and has a significantly higher activation energy barrier. These mechanisms are consistent with the high olefin selectivity observed for single-site Zn(II) on SiO2.

本研究报道了一种由二氧化硅支持的单个位点锌(II)催化剂对丙烷脱氢和丙烯氢化反应的高选择性（超过95%）。在脱氢温度（550°C及以上）下，催化剂的稳定性良好，且催化副产品很少。在反应条件下，锌(II)离子失去一个ZnO键，形成一个配位不饱和、3价活性中心。催化剂通过非氧化还原（金属）机制激活HH和CH键，该机制包括异裂CH键的断裂，与氧化插入/还原消除途径等同裂机制相对照。计算得到的少数催化途径包括在锌(II)位点处不可欲的CC键断裂，遵循不同的机制，并具有显著更高的活化能壁垒。这些机制与在SiO2上单个位点锌(II)的高烯烃选择性一致。
