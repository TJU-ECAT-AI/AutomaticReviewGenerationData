This study reports the highly selective (more than 95%) dehydrogenation of propane to propylene as well as the reverse hydrogenation reaction by silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst. The catalyst is thermally stable at dehydrogenation temperature (550 C and above), and catalytic byproducts are small. In situ UV-resonance Raman, XANES, and EXAFS spectra reveal that tetrahedrally coordinated Zn(II) ions are chemisorbed into the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface. Under reaction conditions, the Zn(II) ion loses one ZnO bond, resulting in a coordinatively unsaturated, 3-coordinate active center. The infrared spectrum of adsorbed pyridine indicates that these are Lewis acid sites. Theoretical calculations based on hybrid density functional theory suggest that the catalyst activates HH and CH bonds by a nonredox (metal) mechanism consisting of heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds, in contrast with the homolytic mechanisms such as oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathways.

Answer: This study demonstrates that a silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst can selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene and reversibly hydrogenate propylene. The catalyst is thermally stable at high temperatures, enabling efficient dehydrogenation while minimizing byproducts. The active site involves tetrahedrally coordinated Zn(II) ions chemisorbed onto the silica surface, which lose one ZnO bond to create a 3-coordinate, coordinatively unsaturated active center. This center facilitates the heterolytic cleavage of alkane and olefin bonds through a non-redox mechanism, distinct from homolytic pathways. The use of theoretical calculations supports the proposed mechanism, highlighting the catalyst's ability to selectively activate bonds for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

这项研究报道了一种由单个位点Zn(II)催化剂支持在硅酸盐上的高效选择性（超过95%）丙烷脱氢为丙烯以及逆向氢化反应。该催化剂在脱氢温度（高于550°C）下稳定，且催化副产品较少。原位紫外共振拉曼、XANES和EXAFS光谱显示，四面体配合的Zn(II)离子被吸附到无定形硅酸盐表面的受限三元硅氧环中。在反应条件下，Zn(II)离子失去一个ZnO键，形成一个3价、配位不饱和的活性中心。红外谱图中的吡啶吸附表明这些是Lewis酸位点。基于混合密度泛函理论的计算表明，催化剂通过非氧化还原（金属）机制激活HH和CH键，包括CH键的异裂，与氧化插入/还原消除路径相反。

In this paper, we report the synthesis of a silica-supported, single-site Zn(II) catalyst that is catalytically active for propylene hydrogenation and highly selective for the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. Raman spectroscopy indicates that the Zn(II) cation selectively reacts with 3-membered siloxane rings on silica to stabilize the single site structure. Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the initial coordination geometry was found to have four ZnO bonds. Under reaction conditions, there is loss of one ZnO bond, giving 3-coordinate Zn site that is the unsaturated, active zinc site without a change in the Zn(II) oxidation state.

Answer: We have developed a silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst that efficiently catalyzes propylene hydrogenation and shows high selectivity for the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the Zn(II) cation specifically interacts with three-membered siloxane rings on silica to maintain the single-site structure. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis shows that the initial coordination geometry features four ZnO bonds. Upon reaching reaction conditions, one ZnO bond is lost, resulting in a 3-coordinate Zn site, which is the unsaturated, active zinc site without altering the Zn(II) oxidation state. This unique structure enables efficient and selective catalysis for both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.
