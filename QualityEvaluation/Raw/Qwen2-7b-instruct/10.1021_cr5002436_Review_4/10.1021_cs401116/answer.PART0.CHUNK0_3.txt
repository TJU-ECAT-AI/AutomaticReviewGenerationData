This study introduces a silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst capable of selectively converting propane to propylene and vice versa. Under specific conditions, the Zn(II) ion loses a ZnO bond, creating a 3-coordinate active center that facilitates the reactions. The catalyst demonstrates high selectivity, with nearly every Zn(II) ion being equally active until poisoned by Lewis bases, which removes one active site per adsorbed poison. The catalyst's synthesis enables its use in propylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation, with Raman spectroscopy showing the Zn(II) ion binds to 3-membered siloxane rings on the silica surface. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the initial coordination geometry has four ZnO bonds, which reduce to a 3-coordinate active center upon reaction. Infrared spectroscopy confirms the Lewis acid nature of the active sites. Density functional theory calculations propose a reaction pathway involving heterolytic bond dissociation for alkane dehydrogenation and olefin hydrogenation, followed by β hydride elimination at the Zn(II) site, explaining the high selectivity observed in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

这项研究介绍了一种由二氧化硅支持的单个位点Zn(II)催化剂，它可以选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯和反向。在特定条件下，Zn(II)离子失去一个ZnO键，形成一个3价活性中心，促进反应。该催化剂表现出高选择性，几乎每个Zn(II)离子都同样活跃，直到被Lewis碱毒化，这会移除吸附的毒化物的一个活性位点。通过合成催化剂，可以在丙烯氢化和丙烷脱氢中使用。拉曼光谱显示Zn(II)离子与二氧化硅表面的3元硅氧环选择性结合以稳定单个位点结构。X射线吸收光谱表明初始配位几何形状有四个ZnO键，在反应过程中减少为一个3价活性中心。红外光谱确认活性位点具有Lewis酸性质。密度泛函理论计算提出了一个反应途径，涉及烷烃脱氢和烯烃氢化中的异裂键断裂，随后是Zn(II)位点上的β氢消除，解释了在丙烷脱氢反应中观察到的高选择性。
