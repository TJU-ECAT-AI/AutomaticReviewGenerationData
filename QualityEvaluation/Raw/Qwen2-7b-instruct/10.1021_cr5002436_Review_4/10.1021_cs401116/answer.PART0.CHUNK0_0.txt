The Zn/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by the method of strong electrostatic adsorption. The hydroxyl groups on SiO2 are weakly acidic with a point of zero charge, or isoelectric point, of pH 4. Thus, in basic aqueous solution, the hydroxyl groups are deprotonated, resulting in a negatively charged support surface. Because of the strong Coulombic attraction between the support and the Zn cation precursor, addition of the tetraaminezinc(II) nitrate solution gives an equilibrium zinc coverage of 1.2 Zn2+/nm2. The amine ligands are subsequently removed by the subsequent thermal treatment to give 3.9% Zn on SiO2 by weight on the high-surface-area silica.

The Zn/SiO2 catalyst was synthesized through a process involving the strong electrostatic adsorption of zinc ions onto the silica surface. The hydroxyl groups on the silica are deprotonated in a basic aqueous solution, creating a negatively charged surface. This results in a zinc coverage of 1.2 Zn2+/nm2, with zinc being thermally treated to remove amine ligands, leaving a catalyst with 3.9% zinc by weight on the high-surface-area silica.

Catalytic Performance: Propylene Hydrogenation and Propane Dehydrogenation Catalytic rates of propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation on the silica-supported Zn catalysts are presented in Table 1. The Zn/SiO2 displays catalytic hydrogenation activity at temperatures above about 150 C. The results presented in Table 1 for propylene hydrogenation at 200 C were determined under differential conversion of 8.2%. Under these conditions, the SiO2 support is unreactive. During the 16-h test period, there is little deactivation, as the steady-state conversion after 12 h is 97% that of the initial conversion. No products other than propane were observed.

The catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation on the silica-supported Zn catalysts is shown in Table 1. At temperatures above approximately 150°C, the Zn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits hydrogenation activity. At 200°C, with a differential conversion of 8.2%, the SiO2 support remains inactive. Over the 16-hour test duration, there is minimal deactivation, with the steady-state conversion after 12 hours being 97% of the initial conversion. Only propane was observed as a product.

Catalyst Structure: X-ray Absorption and Raman Spectroscopy The oxidation state and coordination geometry of the active site was investigated using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) edge energies, presented in Table 2 and Figure 2a,c, were recorded under the reaction conditions and at lower temperature after reaction. The XANES energy of the catalyst is similar to the reference compounds of ZnO and Zn acetate, consistent with Zn(II) ions. Furthermore, over a range of conditions, the XANES shape (figure 2c) and edge energies (Table 2) remain unchanged, suggesting that the Zn oxidation state does not change during reaction.

Density Functional Theory Computational Methods First-principles calculations based on the hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) have been performed to understand the binding of Zn on silica surface as well as the catalytic mechanism of propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. The surface is represented using a cluster model consisting of different size siloxane rings (silsesquioxane), which has been shown to be good approximations of local sites on amorphous silica surfaces.
