I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

h i g  h  l  i  g h t  s • We  genotyped the  BDNF  rs6265 gene  polymorphism in methamphetamine-abuse patients. • We  assessed impulsivity by  Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 Chinese version. • No  association was  found between methamphetamine abuse and the  polymorphism. • BIS  attentional impulsivity score  was  lower  in  Val/Val carriers  of  rs6265. • The  polymorphism may  contribute to age  of onset  of  methamphetamine use. a r  t i c  l e i  n  f  o Article history: Received 17 May 2014 Received in revised form 15 August 2014 Accepted 18 August 2014 Available online 27 August 2014 Keywords: Methamphetamine Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Impulsivity Genotype Association a b s t  r  a c  t Recent studies showed an  association between a functional polymorphism of  BDNF gene  (Val66Met) and the  susceptibility to  methamphetamine addiction.
We  hypothesized that  this  polymorphism was associated with methamphetamine abuse and  impulsivity in  methamphetamine-abuse patients.
The polymorphism was  genotyped in  200  methamphetamine-abuse patients and  219  healthy controls.
The association of  the  Val66Met polymorphism of  the  BDNF  gene and impulsivity in  138  methamphetamine abusers were  assessed using Barratt  Impulsivity Scale-11(BIS-11) Chinese version.
The  relationship between the  polymorphism and  age  of  onset of methamphetamine abuse  was  also  examined.
Our  results showed no  significant differences in  genotype and allele  distributions between the  methamphetamine abusers and  controls.
Within the  methamphetamine-abuse group,subjects carried the  Met  allele  had significantly higher  attentional impulsivity scores of BIS  compared to those with  the  Val/Val geno- type.
The  Met  allele  was  also  associated with  earlier age  onset of  methamphetamine use.  Our  findings suggest that  the  BDNF  Val66Met gene  polymorphism may influence attentional impulsivity in metham- phetamine abusers.
Moreover,the  BDNF  Val66Met gene polymorphism may  contribute to  onset age  of methamphetamine use.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
