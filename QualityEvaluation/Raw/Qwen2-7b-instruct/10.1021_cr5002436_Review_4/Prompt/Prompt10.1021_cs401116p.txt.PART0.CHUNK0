SchweitzerBo HuUjjal DasHacksung KimJeffrey GreeleyLarry A. CurtissPeter C. StairJeffrey T. Miller*Adam S. Hock* View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract This study reports the highly selective (more than 95%) dehydrogenation of propane to propylene as well as the reverse hydrogenation reaction by silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst. The catalyst is thermally stable at dehydrogenation temperature (550 C and above), and catalytic byproducts are small. In situ UV-resonance Raman, XANES, and EXAFS spectra reveal that tetrahedrally coordinated Zn(II) ions are chemisorbed into the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface. Under reaction conditions, the Zn(II) ion loses one ZnO bond, resulting in a coordinatively unsaturated, 3-coordinate active center. The infrared spectrum of adsorbed pyridine indicates that these are Lewis acid sites. Theoretical calculations based on hybrid density functional theory suggest that the catalyst activates HH and CH bonds by a nonredox (metal) mechanism consisting of heterolytic cleavage of CH bonds, in contrast with the homolytic mechanisms such as oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathways. The computed minority catalytic pathway consists of undesired CC bond cleavage at Zn(II) site, follows a slightly different mechanism, and has a significantly higher activation energy barrier. These mechanisms are consistent with the high olefin selectivity observed for single-site Zn(II) on SiO2.

Olefin production is critical to the polymer and chemical industries as well as for the production of fuels. Currently, olefins are produced by thermal cracking (1) or by catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes using supported Pt metal or Cr oxide (2) catalysts. Both processes operate at high temperatures above 450 C, where thermodynamics favors high olefin yields. For alkanes with three or more carbons, all the current processes result in mixtures of CC and CH cracked products. For example, propane thermal cracking produces propylene, ethylene, methane, and hydrogen. Because of lower propylene selectivity associated with thermal cracking, catalytic processes are favored with propane. Although higher propylene selectivity is generally attained, catalyst deactivation due to the deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface is often severe, requiring frequent or continuous catalyst regeneration. Therefore, further improvements in the propylene selectivity, that is, reducing the CC cleavage reaction, remains an important catalytic goal.
ZnO is weakly active for the catalytic hydrogenation of olefins (3) at room temperature but becomes active after high-temperature treatment. Bulk ZnO has been shown to activate hydrogen, hydocarbons, and olefins through a heterolytic cleavage mechanism. The active site has been proposed to be a defect site formed by dehydration of two adjacent ZnOH groups at elevated temperatures to evolve H2O and form a ZnOZn site. Hydrogen was thought to dissociate on the low coordinate Zn(II) ions, forming ZnH and a ZnOH sites in a stoichiometric manner. ZnO was not active for the dehydrogenation of alkanes. At high temperatures, it reduces to form zinc metal, which is a liquid (mp 420 C (4)) around the temperatures where dehydrogenation becomes favorable. Thus, hydrogenation is possible over ZnO, but dehydrogenation is not, because of the instability of ZnO at high temperatures.
Alternatively, single-site Zn(II) ions in MFI zeolite have often been suggested to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation during conversion of propane to aromatics. (5) Although Zn(II) and Ga(III) (6) ions improve the catalyst performance, Brnsted sites in these catalysts also promote these same reactions. (7) In addition, because the initially formed olefins rapidly react at the Brnsted sites, undergoing oligomerization, isomerization, cracking, and aromatization, it has not been possible to demonstrate the independent catalytic function of these exchanged cations. Attempts have been made to neutralize the acid sites, but residual protons contribute significantly to the observed catalysis. (5a) Nevertheless, Zn2+ ions have been suggested to catalytically dehydrogenate alkanes to olefins.
The hydrogenation reactivity of ZnO and the catalytic properties Zn/MFI suggest that low-coordinate, single-site Zn2+ may be capable of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefin and hydrogen catalysis if it can be stabilized toward reduction; however, the coordination geometry of the Zn2+ site is a key parameter for catalytic activity. For example, Zn2+ is bound ionically to H-MFI catalysts, forming a 6-coordinate ion pair in the presence of water. (5a) The impact of more covalent ligand/support interactions has not been reported, although it is reasonable to believe that Zn2+ could be an active and selective dehydrogenation catalyst if isolated in the correct ligand environment on a solid support.
In this paper, we report the synthesis of a silica-supported, single-site Zn(II) catalyst that is catalytically active for propylene hydrogenation and highly selective for the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. Raman spectroscopy indicates that the Zn(II) cation selectively reacts with 3-membered siloxane rings on silica to stabilize the single site structure. Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the initial coordination geometry was found to have four ZnO bonds. Under reaction conditions, there is loss of one ZnO bond, giving 3-coordinate Zn site that is the unsaturated, active zinc site without a change in the Zn(II) oxidation state. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine shows these are Lewis acid sites. The catalyst is readily poisoned by Lewis bases, with the loss of one active site per adsorbed poison, suggesting that nearly every Zn(II) is equally active.
On the basis of density functional theory calculations, a reaction pathway for olefin hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation is proposed. A key step in the pathway is the reaction of 3-coordinate Zn(II) to heterolytically dissociate CH sigma bonds in alkane dehydrogenation and HH sigma bonds in olefin hydrogenation, followed by rate-determining β hydride elimination of the resulting Zn(II) propyl (for the dehydrogenation reaction). The relative ease of the CH and HH heterolytic dissociation versus CC dissociation is the reason for the high observed selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. 2 Experimental Section Catalyst Synthesis The Zn/SiO2 catalyst was synthesized using the strong electrostatic adsorption methodology. (8) Twenty-five grams of silica (SiO2, Davisil 646, 3560 mesh, 300 m2/g and 1.1 cc/g, Aldrich) was suspended in 200 mL of deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 using concentrated ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). In a separate flask, 5 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Aldrich), which is in excess of one monolayer of adsorbed precursor on the support surface, was dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water and adjusted to a pH of 11 using ammonium hydroxide. Initially, the Zn solution precipitated, but continued addition of NH4OH resulted in a clear, colorless solution. The basic Zn solution was rapidly added to the silica, and the solution was stirred for 10 min. After the solid was allowed to settle for 5 min, the solution was decanted. The resultant slurry was rinsed by adding 200 mL of H2O and stirring for 10 min. After the solid settled, the water was decanted. The resulting slurry was vacuum filtered, rinsed several times with deionized water, dried overnight in air at 125 C, and subsequently calcined in air with a 1 h ramp to 300 C and maintained for 3 h. The Zn loading was determined to be 3.9% by Galbraith Laboratories, Inc. (Knoxville, TN) using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.
Catalyst Testing Procedures The catalyst performance testing was conducted in a vertical, quartz tube reactor equipped with mass flow controllers. The products were determined by online gas chromatography (50 m GS-Alumina capillary column). In a typical test, 1 g (3.5 cc) of catalyst was supported on quartz wool with an internal thermal couple positioned at the top of the catalyst bed. Initially, the catalyst was purged with He (99.999%, Airgas USA, LLC), which had been further purified using an oxygen trap, at 300 mL/min at room temperature and then for 15 min at about 100 C. Then the temperature of the reactor was raised to the reaction temperature (200 C for hydrogenation, 550 or 650 C for dehydrogenation) and given 23 h for the temperature to stabilize. Once the temperature had stabilized, He was changed to the reactant stream. For propylene hydrogenation, the reaction mixture was 88 mL/min of 4% H2/Ar mixture and 16 mL/min 4% propene/Ar, resulting in a contact time of 2.0 s. For propane dehydrogenation, the reaction mixture was 3% propane/Ar at 55 mL/min, giving a contact time of 3.8 s. Generally, the conversions were under differential conditions, that is, <10%; however, the flow rate and temperature were also varied to obtain higher conversions. Product composition was determined by gas calibration standards and analyzed by a flame ionization detector (FID) using H2 (99.999%, Airgas USA, LLC) and air (<2 ppm H2O, Airgas USA, LLC).Catalyst poisoning experiments were conducted by loading the catalyst into a round-bottom flask sealed with a septum. The flask was then attached to a Schlenk line, at <2 Torr pressure, and heated to 160 C. After evacuation and without opening to air, a predetermined amount of isopropyl alcohol or pyridine was injected via syringe into the flask through the septum, where it vaporized and adsorbed to the catalyst surface over 1 h. The catalyst was then loaded into the quartz reactor tube (in air) and tested as described above. The 0.25 and 0.5 equivalents were 2-propanol-poisoned, and pyridine was used for the 1.0 equivalents. The pyridine sample was also used for infrared study before and after catalysis (see below).In Situ X-ray Absorption (XAS) Experiments Measurements of the Zn K-edge (9.659 keV) were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT, 10-BM) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. The catalyst was pressed into a 4 mm self-supporting wafer and placed in a stainless steel holder. The holder was then placed into a quartz tube (1 in. o.d., 10 in. length) reactor capped with Ultra-Torr fittings equipped with shut-off valves. Both ends of the reactor were sealed with Kapton windows. The reactor contains an internal thermocouple, located at the sample, that controls the clam shell furnace. (9) The catalyst was tested at room temperature after synthesis, in flowing H2/propylene/He (100 cc/min) at 200 C and propane/He at 550 C for the corresponding XANES data. To minimize contributions due to thermal effects, after the XAS measurements at elevated temperature, the data were also obtained after the catalysts were cooled in He to room temperature without exposure to air.Ionization chambers were optimized at the midpoint of the Zn spectrum for the maximum current with linear response (1010 photons detected s1) using 5% Ar in N2 (15% absorption) in the incident X-ray detector and a mixture of 25% Ar in N2 (70% absorption) in the transmission X-ray detector. A third detector in the series simultaneously collected a Zn foil reference spectrum with each measurement for energy calibration. A cryogenically cooled double-crystal Si(111) monochromator was used and detuned to 50% to minimize the presence of harmonics. The X-ray beam was 0.5 × 1.5 mm, and data were collected in transmission geometry over 10 min in step-scan mode.The Zn K-edge XANES energy was determined from the inflection point of the leading edge by determination of the energy of the maximum in the first peak of the first derivative. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fits of the Zn/silica catalysts were determined from experimental phase shift and backscattering amplitudes, which were obtained from the ZnO (3 ZnO at 1.97 Å and 1 ZnO at 1.99 Å (10)). Standard procedures based on WINXAS 3.1 software were used to fit the XAS data. The EXAFS coordination parameters were obtained by a least-squares fit in r-space of the first shell nearest neighbor, k2-weighted Fourier transform data.Raman Spectroscopy The excitation wavelength of 287 nm for in situ UV Raman measurements are provided by third-harmonic generation output of a 4 kHz repetition rate, nanosecond-pulsed, wavelength-tunable Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Indigo-S). (11) The laser power delivered to the catalyst was 3 mW. UV Raman spectra were recorded with a triple-grating spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, Trivista 555) equipped with a liquid N2-cooled, UV-enhanced CCD detector. Prior to the measurement, samples were calcined at 300 C for 4 h. In situ Raman spectra were collected at room temperature with flowing He in the fluidized bed reactor described previously. (11) Infrared Spectroscopy of Adsorbed Pyridine For pyridine adsorption experiments, catalysts were preheated at 200 C under vacuum (<5 mTorr) and cooled to room temperature. Then pyridine was injected through a septum using a syringe onto the catalysts under vacuum at room temperature. Subsequently, the catalysts were heated at 200 C for 1 h under vacuum to remove physisorbed pyridine. The adsorbed catalysts were cooled to RT and mounted in an infrared cell having CaF2 windows. Nitrogen gas was used to purge the sample chamber as well as the spectrometer. The FTIR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer coupled to an MCT detector with 2 cm1 resolution.Density Functional Theory Computational Methods First-principles calculations based on the hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) (12) have been performed to understand the binding of Zn on silica surface as well as the catalytic mechanism of propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. The surface is represented using a cluster model consisting of different size siloxane rings (silsesquioxane), (13) which has been shown to be good approximations of local sites on amorphous silica surfaces. The electronic effect on amorphous silica is mostly local; therefore, cluster models are reasonably accurate for studying chemical reactions. The structure optimizations and free energy calculations of different reaction intermediates and transition states are performed using the Gaussian-09 quantum chemistry software. (14) The accuracy of the transition state (TS) calculations was verified by performing the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) scan (15) and frequency analysis. TZVP basis sets (16) were used to perform all the calculations (B3LYP/TZVP). 3 Results and Discussion The Zn-on-silica catalyst was prepared by the method of strong electrostatic adsorption. (8) The hydroxyl groups on SiO2 are weakly acidic with a point of zero charge, or isoelectric point, of pH 4. Thus, in basic aqueous solution, the hydroxyl groups are deprotonated, resulting in a negatively charged support surface. Because of the strong Coulombic attraction between the support and the Zn cation precursor, addition of the tetraaminezinc(II) nitrate solution gives an equilibrium zinc coverage of 1.2 Zn2+/nm2. The amine ligands are subsequently removed by the subsequent thermal treatment to give 3.9% Zn on SiO2 by weight on the high-surface-area silica.Catalytic Performance: Propylene Hydrogenation and Propane Dehydrogenation Catalytic rates of propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation on the silica-supported Zn catalysts are presented in Table 1. The turnover frequency (TOF) is based on the total amount of Zn. Figure 1 shows the rate and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation with the time on stream for Zn/SiO2 and SiO2 (no Zn). The rate and low selectivity of silica is identical to that of an empty tube, that is, gas-phase thermal cracking. (17) Figure 1 Figure 1.

The Zn/SiO2 displays catalytic hydrogenation activity at temperatures above about 150 C. The results presented in Table 1 for propylene hydrogenation at 200 C were determined under differential conversion of 8.2%. Under these conditions, the SiO2 support is unreactive. During the 16-h test period, there is little deactivation, as the steady-state conversion after 12 h is 97% that of the initial conversion. No products other than propane were observed. Few zinc materials, homogeneous or heterogeneous, have been observed to catalytically or even stoichiometrically hydrogenate or otherwise react with olefins. Stoichiometric 1,2-ZnH addition across an olefin is rare, but it has been shown that ZnH adds across an olefin in a stoichiometric reaction with a Ti (18) or Ni (19) complex present. Zn/ZSM-5 has not been shown to be active for olefin hydrogenation because olefins are rapidly polymerized over the protons in the catalyst framework. The fact that Zn/SiO2 requires elevated reaction temperatures for hydrogenation catalysis is consistent with the difficulty expected for insertion of an olefin into a ZnH and the stability of zinc alkyls toward the microscopic reverse reaction, β-hydride elimination. However, because hydrogenation catalysis is well-behaved, we surmised that Zn/SiO2 might catalyze alkane dehydrogenation.
The thermal stability of Zn/SiO2 allows it to be employed as an alkane dehydrogenation catalyst at temperatures where the reaction becomes thermodynamically favorable (T > 550 C). Above 600 C, thermal cracking (tested both in an empty tube and with SiO2) is significant, resulting in products from both CH bond breaking (propylene and hydrogen) and CC bond breaking (methane and ethylene). The selectivity of gas-phase cracking is 4:3 CH bond breaking products to CC bond breaking products (i.e., selectivies of 40%, 30%, and 30% propylene, methane, and ethylene, respectively), consistent with what has been reported in the literature. (17) At 550 C, gas-phase thermal cracking is small, and the Zn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits >95% selectivity to propylene and hydrogen throughout the course of the reaction. Furthermore, the catalyst is active for several hours, with the rate decreasing to 50% of the initial conversion after 12 h. In this experiment, propane conversion ranged from 5 to 20% and was intentionally kept low to perform accurate kinetics under differential conditions (the equilibrium conversion at 550 C is 37%2). The selectivity of Zn/SiO2 dehydrogenation selectivity was similarly high at higher propane conversions. At 650 C, where significant contribution from thermal cracking was observed, the catalytic dehydrogenation selectivity remained high at 95% propylene.
Catalyst Structure: X-ray Absorption and Raman Spectroscopy The oxidation state and coordination geometry of the active site was investigated using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) edge energies, presented in Table 2 and Figure 2a,c, were recorded under the reaction conditions and at lower temperature after reaction. The XANES energy of the catalyst is similar to the reference compounds of ZnO and Zn acetate, consistent with Zn(II) ions. Furthermore, over a range of conditions, the XANES shape (figure 2c) and edge energies (Table 2) remain unchanged, suggesting that the Zn oxidation state does not change during reaction. These results differ from those reported for Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts. For example, in the study by Biscardi et al., (20) although there was no shift in the edge energy, there was a significant change in the shape of the XANES edge when the temperature increased above 50 C; the shape continued to change up to 300 C. Because H2O pulses restored the shape, it was concluded that this shape change was due to H2O desorption. For Zn/silica, there is no change in the XANES at low temperature, which is indicative of H2O desorption, as observed for Zn/MFI.
