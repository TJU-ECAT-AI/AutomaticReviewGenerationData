Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique surface chemistry and structure, allowing for more effective adsorption and activation of reactants. Higher temperatures increase activity, while the high surface area and porosity of these materials facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. This phenomenon has profound implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, potentially improving selectivity and stability in chemical processes.
