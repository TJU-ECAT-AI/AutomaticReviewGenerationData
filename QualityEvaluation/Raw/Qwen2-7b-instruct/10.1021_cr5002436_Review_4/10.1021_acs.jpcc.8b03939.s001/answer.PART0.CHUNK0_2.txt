The unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials, such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions is attributed to their unique structure and surface chemistry. These materials offer a large surface area and specific functional groups that enhance their catalytic efficiency. Temperature significantly affects their activation, while surface chemistry, particularly the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, influences their performance. This phenomenon holds great promise for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, especially in industrial applications like petrochemical processes.
