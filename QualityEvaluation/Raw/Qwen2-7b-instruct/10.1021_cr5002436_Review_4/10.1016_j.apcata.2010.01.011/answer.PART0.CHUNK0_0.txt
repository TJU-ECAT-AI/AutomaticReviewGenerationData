[1] "All In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity."
[2] "The order of the steady activity of binary metal oxides at the reaction temperature of 873 K was as follows: InAl-20 > InZn-20 > In Zr-20 > InTi-20 > InFe-20 > InMg-20 > InSi-20 > InCe-20."
[3] "The conversion of propane over different compositions of In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts as a function of the reaction time has been depicted in Fig. 2."
[4] "The positive effect of CO2 concentration on the propane dehydrogenation over InAl-20 can be further seen from Fig. 3."
[5] "The rate of deactivation of the InAl-20 catalyst increases with increasing the reaction temperature and time as shown in Fig. 5."
[6] "The main finding reported here is that supported In2O3 can be applied as new effective catalyst for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2."
[7] "The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leading to a high component dispersion is suggested to play a key role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, which makes the In2O3Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the reaction."
[8] "The highest catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K."
