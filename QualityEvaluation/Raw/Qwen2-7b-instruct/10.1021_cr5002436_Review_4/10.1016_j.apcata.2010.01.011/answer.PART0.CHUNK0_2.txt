[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of the considerable industrial importance, for it represents a route that economically upgrades low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into the more expen- sive alkenes [1]."
[2] "It has been shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
[3] "Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process CO2 can act as a diluent [19,21,22], it delivers the required heat and reduces coking of catalyst by the coke gasification."
[4] "All In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity."
[5] "The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leading to a high component dispersion is suggested to play a key role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, which makes the In2O3Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the reaction."
[6] "Indeed, a clear advantage of the InAl-20 catalyst over a Ga2O3 sample was noticed when propane was dehydroge- nated using b-Ga2O3 under otherwise identical conditions (see Fig. 2)."

The document discusses the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, to produce alkenes, with a focus on the use of indium oxide (In2O3) as an efficient catalyst. Various carbon-based materials, including indium oxide and its binary mixed metal oxides with aluminum (In2O3Al2O3), demonstrate unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The key factors influencing this activity include the specific interaction between indium oxide and aluminum oxide, leading to a high dispersion of indium species. This dispersion plays a crucial role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, making the In2O3Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation process. The document highlights that the In2O3Al2O3 catalyst, especially with a 20 mol% indium content, shows superior performance in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2), offering a higher yield of propylene compared to commercial processes. Furthermore, the catalysts maintain high activity and stability over time, which is a notable improvement over gallium oxide-based catalysts. The advantage of using indium oxide catalysts over gallium oxide is demonstrated when comparing the dehydrogenation of propane using gallium oxide catalysts under identical conditions.

文档讨论了烷烃的催化脱氢，特别是丙烷转化为更昂贵的烯烃的工业重要性。文中提到，使用氧化铟（In2O3）作为高效催化剂，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的活性。各种碳基材料，包括氧化铟及其与铝的二元混合氧化物（In2O3Al2O3），在烷烃脱氢反应中展现出异常的催化活性。影响这种活性的关键因素是氧化铟和氧化铝之间特定的相互作用，导致表面铟物种高度分散。这种分散在调节氧化铟的还原性和结构性质方面起着关键作用，使得In2O3Al2O3复合材料在反应中具有高度的活性和稳定性。文献指出，尤其是含有20摩尔%铟的In2O3Al2O3催化剂，在二氧化碳（CO2）的存在下，显示出高于商业过程的丙烯产量。此外，这些催化剂在长时间运行后仍能保持高活性和稳定性，这与镓氧化物基催化剂相比是一个显著的优点。使用铟氧化物催化剂相对于镓氧化物的优势通过比较在相同条件下使用b-Ga2O3进行丙烷脱氢时Ga2O3样品的性能得到证实。
