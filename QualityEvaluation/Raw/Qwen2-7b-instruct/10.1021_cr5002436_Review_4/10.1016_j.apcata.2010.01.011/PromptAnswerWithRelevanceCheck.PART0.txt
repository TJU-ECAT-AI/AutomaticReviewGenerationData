[1] "Recently, the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant to activate the short chain alkanes has emerged as new promising technology for the development of safer, more economical and environmentally friendly propane dehydrogenation process."
[2] "In all cases, the major product formed in the reaction is propylene, and the minor products are ethane, ethylene, and methane."
[3] "The highest yield of propylene (25.6%) amongst the various binary metal oxide catalysts was afforded by In2O3Al2O3."
[4] "It is important to note that the slow deactivation of the InAl-20 sample, when compared to the Ga2O3-based catalysts, could be due to the apparently low carbon deposition (see Table 2) as a consequence of its moderate surface acidity [35]."
[5] "All data were collected at the reaction time of 3 h. One can see that the rate of propylene formation remarkably increased together with that of CO and H2O formation with increasing the partial pressure of CO2."
[6] "The main finding reported here is that supported In2O3 can be applied as new effective catalyst for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of the considerable industrial importance, for it represents a route that economically upgrades low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into the more expen- sive alkenes [1]."
[2] "It has been shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one."
[3] "Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process CO2 can act as a diluent [19,21,22], it delivers the required heat and reduces coking of catalyst by the coke gasification."
[4] "All In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good propylene selectivity."
[5] "The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leading to a high component dispersion is suggested to play a key role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, which makes the In2O3Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the reaction."
[6] "Indeed, a clear advantage of the InAl-20 catalyst over a Ga2O3 sample was noticed when propane was dehydroge- nated using b-Ga2O3 under otherwise identical conditions (see Fig. 2)."

The document discusses the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane, to produce alkenes, with a focus on the use of indium oxide (In2O3) as an efficient catalyst. Various carbon-based materials, including indium oxide and its binary mixed metal oxides with aluminum (In2O3Al2O3), demonstrate unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The key factors influencing this activity include the specific interaction between indium oxide and aluminum oxide, leading to a high dispersion of indium species. This dispersion plays a crucial role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, making the In2O3Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation process. The document highlights that the In2O3Al2O3 catalyst, especially with a 20 mol% indium content, shows superior performance in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2), offering a higher yield of propylene compared to commercial processes. Furthermore, the catalysts maintain high activity and stability over time, which is a notable improvement over gallium oxide-based catalysts. The advantage of using indium oxide catalysts over gallium oxide is demonstrated when comparing the dehydrogenation of propane using gallium oxide catalysts under identical conditions.

文档讨论了烷烃的催化脱氢，特别是丙烷转化为更昂贵的烯烃的工业重要性。文中提到，使用氧化铟（In2O3）作为高效催化剂，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的活性。各种碳基材料，包括氧化铟及其与铝的二元混合氧化物（In2O3Al2O3），在烷烃脱氢反应中展现出异常的催化活性。影响这种活性的关键因素是氧化铟和氧化铝之间特定的相互作用，导致表面铟物种高度分散。这种分散在调节氧化铟的还原性和结构性质方面起着关键作用，使得In2O3Al2O3复合材料在反应中具有高度的活性和稳定性。文献指出，尤其是含有20摩尔%铟的In2O3Al2O3催化剂，在二氧化碳（CO2）的存在下，显示出高于商业过程的丙烯产量。此外，这些催化剂在长时间运行后仍能保持高活性和稳定性，这与镓氧化物基催化剂相比是一个显著的优点。使用铟氧化物催化剂相对于镓氧化物的优势通过比较在相同条件下使用b-Ga2O3进行丙烷脱氢时Ga2O3样品的性能得到证实。

[1] "In2O3Al2O3 afforded the highest yield of propylene (25.6%) amongst the various binary metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "All In2O3MOx binary mixed oxides display an appreciable or pronounced activity for propylene formation, the simple oxide of bulk In2O3 demonstrated a very low activity."
[3] "Combined XRD and H2-TPR results demonstrated that the specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 can result in the formation of In2O3Al2O3 in which the structural and surface redox properties are substantially modified."

[5] "The high catalytic activity of the present In2O3Al2O3 catalysts has been attributed to the favorable creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters as a consequence of in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period."

1. The In2O3Al2O3 catalysts showed the highest yield of propylene in the dehydrogenation of propane compared to other binary metal oxide catalysts. The bulk In2O3 catalyst had a significantly lower activity. The interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 resulted in the formation of In2O3Al2O3 with altered structural and redox properties. The best performance was achieved with a 20 mol% indium content, leading to a steady propylene yield of around 27% at 873 K. The high activity was attributed to the creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters through the in situ reduction of dispersed indium sites during the induction period.

1. In2O3Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯产率最高，与其他二元金属氧化物催化剂相比。纯In2O3催化剂活性显著较低。In2O3与Al2O3之间的特异性相互作用导致形成In2O3Al2O3，其结构和表面还原性质有显著改变。最佳性能在20摩尔%的铟含量下实现，这允许在873 K时丙烷脱氢反应中稳定生成约27%的丙烯。这种高活性归因于通过诱导期内在位面上散射的铟物种的原位还原产生的表面稳定金属In0纳米簇。

The study demonstrates that indium oxide (In2O3)-based materials are new attractive catalysts applicable for propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (CO2). The InAl mixed oxides exhibit superior performance due to the formation of highly dispersed InOx species in the synthesized materials. The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leads to the formation of In2O3Al2O3, where the structural and surface redox properties are significantly altered. Compared to bulk In2O3, the as-prepared In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts show significantly enhanced activity for propane dehydrogenation. The highest catalytic performance is achieved at a 20 mol% indium content in the In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst, allowing the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of approximately 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K.
