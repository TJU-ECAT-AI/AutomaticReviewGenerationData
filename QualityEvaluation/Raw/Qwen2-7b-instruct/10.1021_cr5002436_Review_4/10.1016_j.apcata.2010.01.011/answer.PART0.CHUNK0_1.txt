[1] "Recently, the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant to activate the short chain alkanes has emerged as new promising technology for the development of safer, more economical and environmentally friendly propane dehydrogenation process."
[2] "In all cases, the major product formed in the reaction is propylene, and the minor products are ethane, ethylene, and methane."
[3] "The highest yield of propylene (25.6%) amongst the various binary metal oxide catalysts was afforded by In2O3Al2O3."
[4] "It is important to note that the slow deactivation of the InAl-20 sample, when compared to the Ga2O3-based catalysts, could be due to the apparently low carbon deposition (see Table 2) as a consequence of its moderate surface acidity [35]."
[5] "All data were collected at the reaction time of 3 h. One can see that the rate of propylene formation remarkably increased together with that of CO and H2O formation with increasing the partial pressure of CO2."
[6] "The main finding reported here is that supported In2O3 can be applied as new effective catalyst for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2."

1. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant has emerged as a promising technology for developing safer, more economical, and environmentally friendly propane dehydrogenation processes.
2. In the reaction, the main product formed was propylene, with minor products including ethane, ethylene, and methane.
3. Among the various binary metal oxide catalysts tested, In2O3Al2O3 provided the highest yield of propylene at 25.6%.
4. Compared to gallia catalysts, the InAl-20 catalyst had slower deactivation, possibly due to less carbon deposition on its surface, which could be related to its moderate surface acidity.
5. The rate of propylene formation increased significantly with the increase in the partial pressure of CO2, along with the formation of CO and H2O.
6. The research demonstrated that supported In2O3 can be effectively used as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2.

1. CO2作为温和氧化剂的新应用已经成为了发展更安全、更经济、更环保的丙烷脱氢过程的有前景技术。
2. 在反应中，主要产物为丙烯，副产品包括乙烷、乙烯和甲烷。
3. 在测试的所有二元金属氧化物催化剂中，In2O3Al2O3提供了最高比例的丙烯产量，达到25.6%。
4. 相对于镓基催化剂，InAl-20催化剂的失活速度较慢，这可能是因为其表面酸性适中，导致较少的碳沉积在催化剂表面。
5. 随着二氧化碳分压的增加，丙烯的生成速率显著提高，同时CO和H2O的生成速率也相应增加。
6. 研究结果表明，支持的In2O3可以有效地用作在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢到丙烯的催化剂。
