[1] "In2O3Al2O3 afforded the highest yield of propylene (25.6%) amongst the various binary metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "All In2O3MOx binary mixed oxides display an appreciable or pronounced activity for propylene formation, the simple oxide of bulk In2O3 demonstrated a very low activity."
[3] "Combined XRD and H2-TPR results demonstrated that the specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 can result in the formation of In2O3Al2O3 in which the structural and surface redox properties are substantially modified."
[4] "Our results show that the highest catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K."
[5] "The high catalytic activity of the present In2O3Al2O3 catalysts has been attributed to the favorable creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters as a consequence of in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface indium sites during the induction period."

1. The In2O3Al2O3 catalysts showed the highest yield of propylene in the dehydrogenation of propane compared to other binary metal oxide catalysts. The bulk In2O3 catalyst had a significantly lower activity. The interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 resulted in the formation of In2O3Al2O3 with altered structural and redox properties. The best performance was achieved with a 20 mol% indium content, leading to a steady propylene yield of around 27% at 873 K. The high activity was attributed to the creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclusters through the in situ reduction of dispersed indium sites during the induction period.

1. In2O3Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯产率最高，与其他二元金属氧化物催化剂相比。纯In2O3催化剂活性显著较低。In2O3与Al2O3之间的特异性相互作用导致形成In2O3Al2O3，其结构和表面还原性质有显著改变。最佳性能在20摩尔%的铟含量下实现，这允许在873 K时丙烷脱氢反应中稳定生成约27%的丙烯。这种高活性归因于通过诱导期内在位面上散射的铟物种的原位还原产生的表面稳定金属In0纳米簇。
