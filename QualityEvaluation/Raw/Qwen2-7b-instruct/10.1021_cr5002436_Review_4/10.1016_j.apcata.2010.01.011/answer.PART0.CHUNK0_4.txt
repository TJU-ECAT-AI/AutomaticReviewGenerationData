[1] "Among the various catalysts studied, the InAl mixed oxides have been found to exhibit superior performance for propane dehydrogenation due to the formation of highly dispersed InOx species in the as-synthesized materials."
[2] "The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 can result in the formation of In2O3Al2O3 in which the structural and surface redox properties are substantially modified."
[3] "Compared to bulk In2O3, the as-prepared In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts show dramatically enhanced activity for propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Our results show that the highest catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K."

The study demonstrates that indium oxide (In2O3)-based materials are new attractive catalysts applicable for propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (CO2). The InAl mixed oxides exhibit superior performance due to the formation of highly dispersed InOx species in the synthesized materials. The specific interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leads to the formation of In2O3Al2O3, where the structural and surface redox properties are significantly altered. Compared to bulk In2O3, the as-prepared In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts show significantly enhanced activity for propane dehydrogenation. The highest catalytic performance is achieved at a 20 mol% indium content in the In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxide catalyst, allowing the steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of approximately 27% in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K.

研究显示，含铟氧化物（In2O3）的材料是适用于丙烷与二氧化碳（CO2）脱氢的新有吸引力的催化剂。InAl复合氧化物表现出优异的性能，由于在合成材料中形成了高度分散的InOx物种。In2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用导致了In2O3Al2O3的形成，在其中结构和表面还原氧化性质显著改变。与纯In2O3相比，制备的In2O3Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂显示出显著增强的丙烷脱氢活性。在In2O3Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂中，当铟含量为20摩尔%时，可以获得最高催化性能，允许在873K下丙烷催化脱氢产生最大丙烯产率约27%。
