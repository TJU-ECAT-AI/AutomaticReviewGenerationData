[1] "The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by the above-noted zinc cations."
[2] "In this connection, in addition to the commonly used low-frequency shifts, we suggest the use of the high intensities of most strongly perturbed IR bands as a criterion of chemical activation of adsorbed molecules in acid catalysis."
[3] "Results of the present study provide the next example of this kind for the stronger molecular form of ethane adsorption connected with selective polarization of the most strongly perturbed CH stretching mode."

The study focuses on the DRIFT investigation of ethane activation and dissociative adsorption by zinc cations in ZSM-5 zeolite. The authors propose using the high intensities of most strongly perturbed IR bands as a criterion for chemical activation of adsorbed molecules in acid catalysis. The research provides evidence for selective polarization of the most strongly perturbed CH stretching mode during the stronger molecular form of ethane adsorption.

本研究专注于通过锌离子在ZSM-5沸石中的吸附对乙烷活化和离散吸附的DRIFT研究。作者建议使用最强扰动红外带的高强度作为酸催化中吸附分子化学激活的标准。研究提供了在更强的乙烷吸附形式下选择性极化最强烈扰动的CH伸缩模式的下一个示例。
