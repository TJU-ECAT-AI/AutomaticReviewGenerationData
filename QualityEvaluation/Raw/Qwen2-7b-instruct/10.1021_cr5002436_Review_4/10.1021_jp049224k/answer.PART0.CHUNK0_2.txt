<p>Indeed, according to classical electrodynamics any motion of an atomic system that is connected with a change of its dipole moment leads to emission or absorption of radiation. Therefore, the intensities of the stretching IR bands are proportional to the squares of the first derivatives of the dipole moments created by the normal stretching vibrations over normal coordinates of these vibrations:17 In other words, intensities of the stretching bands are directly related to the polarizability of chemical bonds induced by interaction with the active sites.</p>
<p>In this connection, in addition to the commonly used low-frequency shifts, we suggest the use of the high intensities of most strongly perturbed IR bands as a criterion of chemical activation of adsorbed molecules in acid catalysis. Unlike low-frequency shifts of stretching vibrations that are proportional to the force constants of the ground states of chemical bonds, intensities of vibrational IR bands are directly connected with polarization of chemical bonds. Therefore, they better reflect the ability of adsorbed molecules for subsequent activation via polarization. In the case of acidbase catalysis, this is the main source of chemical activation.</p>

The document discusses how the intensities of IR stretching bands can serve as a criterion for assessing the chemical activation of adsorbed molecules during acid catalysis. Specifically, it suggests that the high intensities of the most strongly perturbed IR bands are indicative of chemical activation, as they are directly related to the polarizability of the chemical bonds involved in the adsorbed molecules. This polarizability is crucial for subsequent activation through polarization, particularly in acid-base catalysis where it is the primary source of chemical activation.

文档讨论了红外拉伸带强度作为评估酸催化过程中吸附分子化学激活的标准。具体而言，它建议最强烈扰动的红外带的高强度是化学激活的标志，因为它们直接与吸附分子中化学键的极化性有关。这种极化性对于后续通过极化进行激活至关重要，特别是在酸碱催化中，这是化学激活的主要来源。
