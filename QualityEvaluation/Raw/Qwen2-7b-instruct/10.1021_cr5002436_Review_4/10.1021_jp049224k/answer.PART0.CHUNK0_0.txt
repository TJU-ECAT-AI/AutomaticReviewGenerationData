<p>The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by the above-noted zinc cations. For this purpose, we used HZSM-5 zeolites modified with zinc either by wet ion exchange or by high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor. 12-16 As has been shown in our previous studies, both preparation methods resulted in similar DRIFT spectra of adsorbed hydrogen15 or methane.16 The main difference between them is the higher extent of substitution of protons by zinc ions for reaction with zinc vapor.</p>
<p>Adsorption of ethane at high equilibrium pressures by both hydrogen and zinc forms of ZSM-5 results in the appearance of four IR bands from the weakly adsorbed species instead of only two bands for gaseous ethane. The positions of the bands with maxima at 2974 and 2941 cm-1 are very close to those for the ν7 and ν10 CH stretching bands of gaseous ethane. 17 Therefore, they also belong to similar vibrations, while the bands at 2920 and 2878 cm-1 most likely are due to the symmetry-forbidden ν5 and ν1 vibrations that became IR active because of the lowering of the symmetry of adsorbed C2H6 molecules. 18 Differences in positions of the narrow DRIFT bands of the gaseous ethane and of the species more strongly adsorbed by Zn2+ ions are also quite small (Figure 3).</p>
<p>In this connection, the higher frequency ν7 band at 2991 cm-1, and the appearance of the new weak bands at 2850 and 2818 cm-1, are most significant and indicate a stronger lowering of the symmetry upon stronger ethane adsorption by the zinc cations.</p>
<p>Starting with the work carried out more than 50 years ago, activation of adsorbed molecules is usually connected with the low-frequency shifts of IR stretching bands. In contrast, even in very recent papers, their intensities are still not used as criteria of chemical activation. However, for heterogeneous acid or acid-base catalysis, where the main source of chemical activation of adsorbed molecules is their polarization, intensities of IR stretching bands are even more important than the low-frequency shifts of stretching vibrations.</p>

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This activity is influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. The proposed mechanisms involve selective polarization of chemical bonds, leading to unusually high intensity and large low-frequency shifts in the IR stretching bands of adsorbed molecules. The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts lie in the ability to tailor surface chemistry and temperature conditions to optimize the polarization of these bonds, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. The unusual DRIFT spectrum of adsorbed ethane represents a first example of anisotropy of polarizability of adsorbed molecules, providing a new explanation for the selectivity of acid-catalyzed reactions at the molecular level.

各种碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳，表现出在烷烃脱氢反应中的意外催化活性。这种活性受到诸如温度和表面化学等因素的影响。提出的机制涉及对化学键的选择性极化，导致吸附分子中IR伸缩振动的异常高强度和大低频偏移。这种现象对于开发新型高效碳基催化剂的含义在于，可以通过调整表面化学和温度条件来优化这些键的极化，从而增强催化活性。吸附乙烷的不寻常DRIFT光谱代表了吸附分子极化各向异性的第一个例子，为酸催化反应在分子水平上的选择性提供了新的解释。
