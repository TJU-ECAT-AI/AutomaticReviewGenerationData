Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support effect has been investigated in detail by testing the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction both in the presence and absence of CO2. Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively. It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3. Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH.

This study investigates the impact of various carbon-based materials, including In2O3/MOx catalysts (M = Al, Zr, Si) with different In2O3 loadings, on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction, particularly in the presence of CO2. The catalysts' physico-chemical properties, such as surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic characteristics, are thoroughly examined through various analytical techniques. It is shown that a higher concentration of highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support enhances propylene production. The most efficient propylene yield is observed with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For optimal performance, the catalysts require high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, facilitating the synergistic effect between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift processes.

这项研究探讨了不同含量的In2O3/MOx（M=Al，Zr，Si）催化剂（MOx为Al2O3、ZrO2和SiO2）对丙烷脱氢反应的影响，特别是当存在CO2时。通过各种分析技术详细考察了催化剂的物理化学性质，如表面组成、氧化还原性和酸碱性。结果表明，支持物上高度分散的In2O3物种的更高浓度有利于丙烯的产生。在高负载的In2O3/Al2O3催化剂中观察到最大的丙烯产率。为了实现最佳性能，催化剂需要高的In2O3分散性和平衡的酸碱性特性，促进脱氢和逆水煤气变换过程的协同作用。
