[1] "Along this line, we have recently demonstrated that In2O3Al2O3 nanocomposite synthesized via alcoholic coprecipitation was highly active and stable as a new catalyst in the PDH with CO2."
[2] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[3] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."
[4] "It is also suggested that acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."
[5] "For each support, both low and high In-loading samples were synthesized."
[6] "Detailed correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acid-base properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts."

The document discusses the use of indium oxide (In2O3) catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, specifically in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). The study focuses on binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Si, Zr) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings. The researchers aim to investigate the support effect by testing the PDH reaction both in the presence and absence of CO2. They characterize the physico-chemical properties of the supported In2O3, including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties, using various analytical techniques. The study reveals that a higher population of specific, highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support is favorable for propylene production, leading to the maximum propylene yield with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. The results suggest that properties such as high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, which facilitate a synergy between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance in PDH.

本文讨论了在二氧化碳（CO2）存在下的丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中使用氧化铟（In2O3）催化剂的应用。研究重点关注了铝（Al）、硅（Si）和锆（Zr）的二元In2O3/MOx（M = Al、Si、Zr）催化剂，其In2O3负载量分别为低（3 wt%）和高（10 wt%）。研究人员旨在通过测试在CO2存在与否下的PDH反应，详细调查支持效果。他们使用各种分析技术来表征支持的In2O3的物理化学性质，包括表面组成、还原性以及酸碱性质。研究表明，在支持上具有较高特定且高度分散的In2O3物种是有利于丙烯生产的，导致最大丙烯产率的催化剂是高负载In2O3/Al2O3催化剂。结果表明，诸如高的In2O3分散度和平衡的酸碱性质等特性对于实现PDH中的高效催化性能至关重要，这些特性能够促进脱氢作用与逆水煤气变换之间的协同作用。
