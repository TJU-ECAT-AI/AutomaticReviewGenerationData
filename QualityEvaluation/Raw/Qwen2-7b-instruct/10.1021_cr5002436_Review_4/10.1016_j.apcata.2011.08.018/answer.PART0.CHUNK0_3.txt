[1] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[2] "It is also suggested that acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."

The InAlO catalysts display a unique bifunctional character due to the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, requiring a balanced mixture of metallic In species and the bulk In2O3 phase for efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, the acid-base properties of the support materials significantly influence the selectivity towards propylene.
