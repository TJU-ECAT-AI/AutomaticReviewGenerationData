[1] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[2] "It is also suggested that acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."
[3] "For each support, both low and high In-loading samples were synthesized."
[4] "Detailed correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acid-base properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts."

The study investigates the impact of indium oxide (In2O3) loaded onto different metal oxides (Al, Si, Zr) as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane, particularly in the presence of CO2. The researchers aim to understand how the support affects the catalytic performance by synthesizing catalysts with both low (around 3 wt%) and high (around 10 wt%) In2O3 loadings. They find that the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and the balance of acidic/basic properties are crucial factors determining the high performance of these In-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

[1] "Along this line, we have recently demonstrated that In2O3Al2O3 nanocomposite synthesized via alcoholic coprecipitation was highly active and stable as a new catalyst in the PDH with CO2."
[2] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[3] "In addition to the specific active phases, the choice of the support, conventionally thought to play important role in the dispersion and electronic properties of the dispersed active species, is able to tune further the catalytic performance of a given catalyst."

The document discusses the use of indium oxide (In2O3) catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, specifically in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). The study focuses on binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Si, Zr) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings. The researchers aim to investigate the support effect by testing the PDH reaction both in the presence and absence of CO2. They characterize the physico-chemical properties of the supported In2O3, including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties, using various analytical techniques. The study reveals that a higher population of specific, highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support is favorable for propylene production, leading to the maximum propylene yield with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. The results suggest that properties such as high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, which facilitate a synergy between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance in PDH.

Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. The support effect has been investigated in detail by testing the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction both in the presence and absence of CO2. Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively. It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3. Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH.

This study investigates the impact of various carbon-based materials, including In2O3/MOx catalysts (M = Al, Zr, Si) with different In2O3 loadings, on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction, particularly in the presence of CO2. The catalysts' physico-chemical properties, such as surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic characteristics, are thoroughly examined through various analytical techniques. It is shown that a higher concentration of highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support enhances propylene production. The most efficient propylene yield is observed with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For optimal performance, the catalysts require high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, facilitating the synergistic effect between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift processes.
