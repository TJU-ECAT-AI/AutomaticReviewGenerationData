<p>In the present study, the support effect for In-based catalysts has been studied, and Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 were selected as three supports, taking into account their differentiated surface properties in terms of affinity to In2O3 and relative acid/base strength.</p>
<p>For each support, both low and high In-loading samples were synthesized.</p>
<p>Details of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveal the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and acid-base properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts.</p>

The study investigated the support effect for In-based catalysts using Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 as supports. Both low and high In-loadings were synthesized for each support. The key parameters determining the high PDH performance of In-based catalysts are the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and acid-base properties.
