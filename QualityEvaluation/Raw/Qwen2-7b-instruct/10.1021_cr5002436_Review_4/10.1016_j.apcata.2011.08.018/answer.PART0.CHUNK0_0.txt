[1] "An interesting feature of the InAlO catalyzed PDH reaction is the unique bifunctional character of the indium component in the In2O3Al2O3 materials, where a well balance of the metallic In species active and the bulk In2O3 phase is found to be indispensable for an efficient CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation over the In2O3Al2O3 system."
[2] "It is also suggested that acid-base properties of supports strongly affect the selectivity to propylene."
[3] "For each support, both low and high In-loading samples were synthesized."
[4] "Detailed correlation of characterization results and PDH activities performed reveals the abundance of highly dispersed indium-species and acid-base properties are two key parameters that determine the high PDH performance for the In-based catalysts."

The study investigates the impact of indium oxide (In2O3) loaded onto different metal oxides (Al, Si, Zr) as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane, particularly in the presence of CO2. The researchers aim to understand how the support affects the catalytic performance by synthesizing catalysts with both low (around 3 wt%) and high (around 10 wt%) In2O3 loadings. They find that the abundance of highly dispersed indium species and the balance of acidic/basic properties are crucial factors determining the high performance of these In-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

研究探讨了在不同金属氧化物（铝、硅、锆）上负载的二氧化铟（In2O3）作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的作用，尤其是在二氧化碳的存在下。研究人员通过合成具有大约3 wt%和10 wt%不同In2O3负载量的催化剂，旨在了解支持对催化性能的影响。他们发现高度分散的铟物种的丰度以及酸性/碱性性质的平衡是决定In基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中高表现的关键因素。
