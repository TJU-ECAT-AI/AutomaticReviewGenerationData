[1] "In the in situ UV Raman study [75], V/θ-Al2O3 samples (0.03 V, 1.2 V, 4.4 V and 14.2 V) that contain surface VOx species with different structures were treated in dilute butane flow at different temperatures and examined by Raman spectra measurements at each temperature."
[2] "Taking the 1.2 V sample as an example, the Raman spectra collected during butane dehydrogenation at different temperatures are shown in Figure 15.6."
[3] "At temperatures below 673 K, a weak Raman band at 1620 cm−1, assigned to C=C stretching in polyalkenes, is observed together with the two bands at 1021 and 915 cm−1 due to the V=O and VOAl modes of surface VOx species, respectively."
[4] "After butane dehydrogenation at 673 and 773 K, an intense band at 1601 cm−1 due to polyaromatic hydrocarbons develops. Simultaneously, bands at 1500, 1438, 1183, 1004 and 845 cm−1 are also observed."
[5] "The intensity of the Raman bands below 1500 cm−1 decreases significantly as the dehydrogenation temperature is increased to 873 K."
[6] "The catalyst had been running under butane for 2 h at 873 K when the gas stream was switched from butane to argon."
[7] "Online mass spectrometry indicated that all hydrocarbon components were rapidly swept out of the reactor at 873 K and no other gases apart from the argon carrier were detected during the cool-down period."
[8] "However, when 2% O2/Ar was passed over the sample at room temperature, butane, butenes, and butadiene were evolved."
[9] "This desorption process can be viewed as an oxidative displacement, resulting in recombination of reaction intermediates (hydrogen and alkyl, alkenyl and alkadienyl) from the surface of reduced VOx species."
[10] "The regeneration of samples of V/θ-Al2O3 coked from low partial pressure butane dehydrogenation via oxidation was also followed by UV Raman spectroscopy as well as gas chromatography."
[11] "The Raman spectroscopy indicates that the structure of the VOx species can be restored by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873 K."
[12] "However, only high loaded samples are fully restored according to UV Vis DRS."
[13] "51 V MAS NMR confirms the re-oxidation of reduced vanadium species."
[14] "Comparison with Figure 15.4 a it can be seen that the spectrum of the regenerated catalysts indicates the presence of a greater quantity of ordered V2O5-like species than were present in the as-prepared catalyst."
[15] "However, one must take care as each technique has its blind spots and it is possible that it is the inability of each of the techniques to see all of the vanadia species that leads to apparent differences."
[16] "The regeneration process involves high temperature oxidation."
