1. A variety of analytical methods, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction (TPR), have been utilized to study the surface properties of fresh and used catalysts.

2. Chromium can exist in multiple oxidation states, specifically (II), (III), (V), and (VI), but in freshly prepared catalysts, the (III) and (VI) states are predominant.

3. Catalysts are commonly synthesized through impregnation of alumina, occasionally utilizing zirconia, derived from chromium-containing solutions like ammonium dichromate, chromic acid, or chromium nitrate.

4. Reduction of the catalyst begins at 543-553 K, peaks at 693 K, and concludes around 723-743 K.

5. Initially, Cr(II) was considered the active species, but more recent studies point to Cr(III) as the active component, though definitive confirmation remains elusive.

6. The onset of reduction varies with the loading percentage, starting at 8% and reaching completion at 873 K for all samples.

7. Oxygen chemisorption at 293 K and 873 K revealed an average oxidation state of 3.8 for 1% VOx/alumina and 2.6 for 3.5% VOx/alumina.

8. An in situ UV Raman study involved treating V/θ-Al2O3 samples with varying surface VOx densities and examining their Raman spectra at different temperatures while exposed to dilute butane flow.

1. 多种分析方法，包括X射线粉末衍射（XRD）、紫外可见漫反射光谱（UV-Vis DRS）、拉曼光谱、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）、红外光谱和温度程序化还原（TPR），被用来研究新鲜和使用过的催化剂的表面特性。

2. 铬可以存在多种氧化状态，具体为（II）、（III）、（V）和（VI），但在刚制备的催化剂中，（III）和（VI）是主要的物种。

3. 催化剂通常通过浸渍氧化铝来合成，偶尔会使用氧化锆，来源于含铬溶液，如硫酸铬铵、重铬酸、或铬酸。

4. 催化剂的还原开始于543-553 K，峰值在693 K，最终在723-743 K结束。

5. 最初，Cr(II)被认为是活性物种，但最近的研究表明Cr(III)作为活性成分更为突出，尽管确切的确认仍有待证实。

6. 还原的起始点随负载百分比而变化，从8%开始，在873 K时所有样品的还原完成。

7. 在293 K和873 K下的氧化学吸附显示，1% VOx/Alumina的平均氧化状态为3.8，3.5% VOx/Alumina的平均氧化状态为2.6。

8. 在位的紫外光谱研究涉及将不同表面VOx密度的V/θ-Al2O3样品用稀丁烷流处理，并在不同温度下测量它们的拉曼光谱。
