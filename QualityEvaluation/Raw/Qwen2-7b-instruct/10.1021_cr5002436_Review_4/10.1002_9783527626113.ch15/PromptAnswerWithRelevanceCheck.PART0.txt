Alkane Dehydrogenation over Vanadium and Chromium Oxides
S. David
Jackson , Peter C.
Stair , Lynn F.
Gladden , and James McGregor

The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation.

Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V), and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as-prepared catalyst, the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species. At low loadings, the +6 state is favored on alumina. On zirconia, however, Cr(V) was found to be 50% of the chromium present.

Typically, catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid, and chromium nitrate. After calcination in air at 823 K, UV-visible analysis of a 6% w/w chrome oxide/γ-alumina revealed the presence of Cr(III) with bands at 280 nm (4A2g 4T1g[P]), 354 nm (4A2g 4T1g[F]), 454 nm (4A2g 2T2g), 590 nm (4A2g 4T2g), and 706 nm (4A2g 2Eg, 2T1g).

XRD analysis revealed that the only detectable chromium species was Cr2O3. Usually, no XRD detectable phase is present until the loading is greater than monolayer coverage, typically 7 wt% for alumina-supported catalysts. Raman spectroscopic analysis reveals the complexity of the chromia species on the surface.

The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair.

The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero-propane (C3D8 or [2H]C3H8) over a hydrogen-reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium-reduced (2H2 or D2) catalyst. In both cases, isotope exchange occurred such that deuterium incorporation was observed in the propane for a deuterium-reduced catalyst and hydrogen incorporation was observed in the deutero-propane for a hydrogen-reduced catalyst.

The rate determining step for propane dehydrogenation over chromia was found to be the loss of the second hydrogen: CHads CHand3 7 3 6 ( ) ( ) + ( ).

For butane dehydrogenation at 873 K and 14,500 GHSV (gas hourly space velocity), the product distribution is 70% unreacted butane, 5% trans-2-butene, 6% 1-butene, 4% cis-2-butene, 1.5% butadiene, and 1% C1C3. For butane dehydrogenation, 1-butene is the primary product.

Both systems deposit carbon, and when run for extended cycles under propane dehydrogenation, polynuclear aromatic compounds form. A Raman spectrum from a 1% chromia/alumina coked catalyst is shown.

The formation of coke on the surface is very similar to that found with propane; however, in the case of butane, the majority of the catalyst deactivation was due to polynuclear aromatics or other forms of coke strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates were also detected. These species can be desorbed at room temperature by treating with a low concentration O2 in Ar mix.

Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2–4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2. The vanadia densities of the catalysts were 1.1 V/nm2 for the sample with the 1% loading, 3.7 V/nm2 for the 3.5% loading, and 10.4 V/nm2 for the 8% loading.

Reduction takes place over a broad range of temperatures, and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading with 8% < 3.5% < 1% but reduction is complete for each sample by 873 K. The weight loss at the reduction step increases with vanadia loading, and there is a 1:1 relationship between vanadium atoms and oxygen atom loss.

Using oxygen chemisorption at 293 K and 873 K, the average oxidation state of the 1% VOx/alumina was calculated as 3.8, whereas the average oxidation state for the 3.5% VOx/alumina was calculated as 2.6. Both of these figures are in excellent agreement with the conclusions from the UV-Vis DRS.

The ease of replacing oxygen that had been removed during reduction was 8% > 3.5% > 1%, and this difference was also seen in the UV-Vis DRS and in TEOM data.

For the 8 wt% catalyst, the UV-Vis DRS revealed a total loss in signal after reduction, indicating the presence of V(III) or V(IV) species.

In situ UV Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the butane dehydrogenation reaction on V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with various surface VOx densities (0.03–14.2 V/nm2). The initial dehydrogenation activity increases as a function of surface VOx density. However, the activity decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm2, apparently due to the formation of surface coke deposits and blocking of surface sites during the reaction.

The Raman spectra collected during butane dehydrogenation at different temperatures show that at temperatures below 673 K, a weak Raman band at 1620 cm−1, assigned to C=C stretching in polyalkenes, is observed together with the two bands at 1021 and 915 cm−1 due to the V=O and VOAl modes of surface VOx species, respectively. After butane dehydrogenation at 673 and 773 K, an intense band at 1601 cm−1 due to polyaromatic hydrocarbons develops. Simultaneously, bands at 1500, 1438, 1183, 1004, and 845 cm−1 are also observed.

As the dehydrogenation temperature is increased to 873 K, the intensity of the Raman bands below 1500 cm−1 decreases significantly. The band at 1500 cm−1 is usually assigned to conjugated polyalkenes or cyclopentadienyl species. The band at 1438 cm−1 is due to the bending mode of CH3/CH2 or CH in aromatic rings. The two sharp bands at 1004 and 845 cm−1 are rarely reported for coke species, and thus one might ascribe them to surface VOx species. However, the absence of an isotope shift on an 18O-exchanged V/θ-Al2O3 sample confirms that these bands are due to surface coke deposits.

An interesting new observation is that although the Raman spectrum seems to indicate that the catalyst surface is free of coke species after polystyrene decomposition, the follow-up TPO (Temperature Programmed Oxidation) shows the evolution of a considerable amount of CO2. This suggests that the absence of typical Raman bands (1000–1650 cm−1 range) due to coke species does not necessarily mean the catalyst is coke free.

Microanalysis of a used 1.2 V catalyst for carbon and hydrogen gave a C:H value of 0.9 as per polystyrene monomer, agreeing with the Raman spectra.

The regeneration of samples of V/θ-Al2O3 coked from low partial pressure butane dehydrogenation via oxidation was followed by UV Raman spectroscopy as well as gas chromatography (GC). The Raman spectroscopy indicates that the structure of the VOx species can be restored by oxidation of the coke deposits up to 873 K. UV-Vis DRS, however, suggests that only high-loaded samples are fully restored.

27Al triple-quantum (3Q) MAS NMR studies have also demonstrated that the nature of the support undergoes a transformation. The loss of an isotropic resonance suggests a transformation towards a more crystalline state in agreement with the reduced surface area.

A structure-function relationship has been established in the dehydrogenation of butane on VOx/θ-Al2O3 catalysts by combined reactivity, UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM, and UV Raman investigations. In this case, both the nature and amount of coke show a dependence on the structure of the VOx/θ-Al2O3 catalysts.

The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface. The regeneration process involves oxidation. In the Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN process, propane is converted to propene over a fixed-bed chromia-alumina catalyst. Catalysts are characterized using a wide range of techniques, revealing the presence of chromium species in various oxidation states. The chromia/alumina catalyst distribution for propane dehydrogenation includes 1% methane, 1% ethane, 1% ethene, 39% propene, and 54% unreacted propane. Carbonaceous materials, including coke deposits, are formed during the dehydrogenation process, which can be hydrogenated off the surface as methane. The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox conditions affects their catalytic performance. Various vanadia loadings lead to different structures of vanadia species, with V2O5 forming at higher surface densities. The average oxidation state of vanadia catalysts is determined by the surface loading, with 1% VOx/alumina having an average oxidation state of 3.8 and 3.5% VOx/alumina having an average oxidation state of 2.6. The ease of replacing oxygen during reduction varies with the vanadium loading. The structure of vanadia species under dehydrogenation conditions influences the coke deposition and catalyst activity.
