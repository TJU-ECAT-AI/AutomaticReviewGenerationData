Commercial LPG Dehydrogenation Process
The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known.

Chromia
A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface...

Chromia/alumina catalysts give the following product distribution for propane dehydrogenation; 1% methane, 1% ethane, 1% ethene, 39% propene and 54% unreacted propane...

Studies using isotopically labeled propane have shown that the route to the coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation goes through a C 1 species,probably CH(a). However, before these species convert to coke there is a period when they are labile and can be hydrogenated off the surface as methane...

The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known. Regeneration of the catalyst is periodic and by oxidation.

Vanadia
Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a signifi cant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems. The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox reaction condi- tions is directly related to the catalytic performance...

Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [63, 64] that isolated VO

This would suggest a change of 2 in the vanadium oxidation state, so if the vanadium were in a +5 oxidation state before reduction it would be converted to +3 after reduction. This was confi rmed by in situ UV - Vis DRS...

The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface. The regeneration process involves oxidation. In the Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN process, propane is converted to propene over a fixed-bed chromia-alumina catalyst. Catalysts are characterized using a wide range of techniques, revealing the presence of chromium species in various oxidation states. The chromia/alumina catalyst distribution for propane dehydrogenation includes 1% methane, 1% ethane, 1% ethene, 39% propene, and 54% unreacted propane. Carbonaceous materials, including coke deposits, are formed during the dehydrogenation process, which can be hydrogenated off the surface as methane. The structure of supported vanadia catalysts under redox conditions affects their catalytic performance. Various vanadia loadings lead to different structures of vanadia species, with V2O5 forming at higher surface densities. The average oxidation state of vanadia catalysts is determined by the surface loading, with 1% VOx/alumina having an average oxidation state of 3.8 and 3.5% VOx/alumina having an average oxidation state of 2.6. The ease of replacing oxygen during reduction varies with the vanadium loading. The structure of vanadia species under dehydrogenation conditions influences the coke deposition and catalyst activity. The Raman spectra of butane dehydrogenation over V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with different surface VOx densities provide insights into the formation of coke species.

轻烷烃的脱氢过程中，由于碳基质沉积在催化剂表面，氧化铬催化剂的失效是普遍存在的。再生过程通常通过氧化进行。Lummus/Houdry CATOFIN工艺使用固定床氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯。多种技术用于表征催化剂表面的氧化物性质，显示了铬物种的不同氧化状态。氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂的丙烷脱氢分布包括1%甲烷、1%乙烷、1%乙烯、39%丙烯和54%未反应的丙烷。在脱氢过程中形成的碳基质材料，包括焦炭沉积物，可以作为甲烷从表面氢化掉。支持型钒催化剂在还原条件下的结构直接影响其催化性能。不同的钒负载导致不同类型的钒物种结构，V2O5在更高的表面密度下形成。1% VOx/氧化铝和3.5% VOx/氧化铝的平均氧化状态分别为3.8和2.6。去除氧气期间替换氧的容易程度随钒负载而变化。但烷压力下，不同表面VOx密度的V/θ-Al2O3催化剂进行丁烷脱氢，并比较了这些不同催化剂的活性和选择性数据。以1.2%的样本为例，不同温度下进行丁烷脱氢收集的拉曼光谱如图15.6所示。
