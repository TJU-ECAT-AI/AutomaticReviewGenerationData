[1] "The deactivation of chromia catalysts during the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, due to the deposition of carbonaceous species onto the catalyst surface, is well known."
[2] "The designs of commercial reactors for this process take different approaches both to managing the deactivation and to the regeneration."
[3] "As was so often the case in the early years of the twentieth century, the dehydrogenation process using a chromia/alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized in Germany at Leuna."
[4] "There was also independent development by UOP (then Universal Oil Products ) in the United States, together with ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries ) in the UK."
[5] "The overall operation is similar to that described for propane to propene, with conversion in region of 50% per pass and selectivity for isobutane to isobutene of greater than 90%; the selectivity of propane to propene is > 86%."
[6] "Typically catalysts are prepared by impregnation of alumina, although zirconia is also used, from a variety of chromium-containing solutions such as ammonium dichromate, chromic acid and chromium nitrate."
[7] "Analysis of the spectra gave approximate values for the various components as 14% monomer/dimer, 50% polymer, 7% crystalline, with the balance found in mixed bands."
[8] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers."
[9] "In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence."
[10] "The presence of residual hydrogen retained by a chromia catalyst after reduction was shown by pulsing aliquots of deutero-propane (C3D8 or [2H]C3H8) over a hydrogen-reduced catalyst and aliquots of propane over a deuterium-reduced (2H2 or D2) catalyst."
[11] "The situation with butane is similar but with significant differences."
[12] "The formation of coke on the surface is very similar to that found with propane."
[13] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."
[14] "Reduction takes place over a broad range of temperatures and the onset of reduction follows the weight loading with 8% < 3.5% < 1% but reduction is complete for each sample by 873 K."
[15] "This difference in onset of reduction may be attributed to different reducibilities of vanadia species, monovanadates, polyvanadates and V2O5 coexisting on the catalyst surface."
[16] "These studies also yield an average 1:1 relationship between vanadium atoms and oxygen atom loss."
[17] "This would suggest a change of 2 in the vanadium oxidation state, so if the vanadium were in a +5 oxidation state before reduction it would be converted to +3 after reduction."
[18] "This was confirmed by in situ UV-Vis DRS."
[19] "V/θ-Al2O3 catalysts with surface VOx density from 0.03 to 14.2 V/nm2 were tested for butane dehydrogenation under low partial pressures of butane at 873 K, and the activity and selectivity data on these different catalysts were compared."
[20] "However, the activity decreases significantly with prolonged reaction time for samples with VOx density higher than 1.2 V/nm2, apparently due to the formation of surface coke deposits and blocking of surface sites during the reaction."
[21] "The Raman spectra collected during butane dehydrogenation at different temperatures are shown in Figure 15.6."
[22] "At temperatures below 673 K, a weak Raman band at 1620 cm−1, assigned to C=C stretching in polyalkenes, is observed together with the two bands at 1021 and 915 cm−1 due to the V=O and VOAl modes of surface VOx species, respectively."
[23] "The intensity of the Raman bands below 1500 cm−1 decreases significantly."
[24] "This suggests that the initial valence state of surface VOx does not affect the nature of coke species and most likely the VOx species is at least partially reduced under butane dehydrogenation conditions."
[25] "An interesting new observation is that although the Raman spectrum seems to indicate that the catalyst surface is free of coke species after polystyrene decomposition, the follow-up TPO (Temperature Programmed Oxidation) shows the evolution of a considerable amount of CO2."
