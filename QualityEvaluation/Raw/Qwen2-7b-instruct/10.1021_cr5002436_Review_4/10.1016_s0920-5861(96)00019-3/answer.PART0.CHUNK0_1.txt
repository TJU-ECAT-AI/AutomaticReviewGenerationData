(i) "The direct conversion of light paraffins (primarily propane and butane) to aromatic compounds is of expanding importance for production of gasoline additives."
(ii) "As no metallic component is present in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite the oxide component and the acid sites should operate as catalytically active sites."
(iii) "The acidic character of these catalysts and the effect of acidity on their activity and/or selectivity have been the topic of quite a large number of papers ([3,18-22], and the references therein)."
(iv) "High cracking activity is characteristic of the catalysts with high surface BrSnsted acidity,while the catalysts having Lewis acidity are effective in the dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions."
(v) "The presence of BriSnsted acid sites results in cracking of the hydrocarbon molecules, whereas the aromatization activity is attributed to Lewis acidity associated with the intimate contact of the oxide/zeolite assemblies."

1. The conversion of light paraffins, particularly propane and butane, into aromatic compounds is increasingly important for gasoline additives production.
2. In Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite, the oxide component and acid sites function as catalytic sites without a metallic component.
3. The acidity characteristics and their impact on catalyst activity and selectivity have been widely explored in numerous studies.
4. Catalysts with high surface BrSnsted acidity exhibit high cracking activity, while those with Lewis acidity are effective in dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions.
5. The presence of BrSnsted acid sites leads to the cracking of hydrocarbon molecules, whereas aromatization activity is attributed to Lewis acidity found in the intimate contact of oxide/zeolite assemblies.

1. 将轻烷烃，尤其是丙烷和丁烷，转化为芳烃化合物对于汽油添加剂生产至关重要。
2. 在Ga/H-ZSM-5沸石中，氧化物成分和酸性位点作为催化活性位点发挥作用，而没有金属成分。
3. 催化剂的酸性特性和它们对活性和选择性的影响是大量研究的主题。
4. 表面BrSnsted酸性高的催化剂表现出高裂解活性，而具有Lewis酸性的催化剂在脱氢和芳构化反应中有效。
5. BrSnsted酸性位点的存在导致碳氢分子裂解，而芳构化活性归因于在氧化物/沸石组装体之间紧密接触的Lewis酸性。
