(i) "The direct conversion of light paraffins (primarily propane and butane) to aromatic compounds is of expanding importance for production of gasoline additives."
(ii) "As no metallic component is present in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite the oxide component and the acid sites should operate as catalytically active sites."
(iii) "The acidic character of these catalysts and the effect of acidity on their activity and/or selectivity have been the topic of quite a large number of papers ([3,18-22], and the references therein)."
(iv) "High cracking activity is characteristic of the catalysts with high surface BrSnsted acidity,while the catalysts having Lewis acidity are effective in the dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions."
(v) "The presence of BriSnsted acid sites results in cracking of the hydrocarbon molecules, whereas the aromatization activity is attributed to Lewis acidity associated with the intimate contact of the oxide/zeolite assemblies."

The direct conversion of light paraffins (primarily propane and butane) to aromatic compounds is of expanding importance for production of gasoline additives. The UOP/BP Cyclar process using a Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst has been scaled up for industrial operation [1].

As no metallic component is present in Ga/H- ZSM-5 zeolite the oxide component and the acid sites should operate as catalytically active sites [2].

Three different procedures have usually been applied for preparation of metal containing cata- lysts of MFI structure.

(i) Synthesis of isomorphously substituted metal silicates with an appropriate metal content in the framework [8,9].

(ii) In connection with the conventional (liquid phase) ion-exchange it is necessary to mention that the solutions of A13+, Ga 3, In 3+ and T13 ions are stable in acidic media. This fact limits the applicability of the conventional ion-exchange procedure apart from the use of siliceous zeolites such as H-ZSM-5 resistant under acidic circumstances [14].

(iii) The solid state ion-exchange method is the most promising procedure for introducing metal ions into zeolites [15]. In general, an intimate mixture of the respective metal oxide and H-ZSM-5 zeolite is prepared and heat treated by a certain temperature program in oxidative or reductive atmosphere [16].

Metal halides are very rarely used for the preparation of gallium or indium containing cat- alysts [17] although H-ZSM-5 zeolite is resistant to HC1 generated [14]. The most probable expla- nation is the difficult preparation and low stabil- ity of these halides.

Acidity of the samples was determined by pyridine adsorption monitored by IR spec- troscopy. For this purpose self-supported wafers with a thickness of 10 mg/cm 2 were pressed and placed into the sample holder of the IR cell.

The conversion of propane as test reaction was studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the presence or absence of oxygen. Catalyst sam- ples (0.5 g) in a quartz tubular reactor were pretreated in nitrogen flow at 773 K for 2 h to standardize the catalyst surface.

Product analysis was performed by an on-line GC (CHROM-5 equipment) using a Porapack-Q column for the analysis of gaseous products, and a Shimadzu GC-16A chromatograph with a 30 m long SPB-1 capillary column for the anal- ysis of the liquid phase products collected dur- ing the 2 h runs.

The conversion and selectivity data of the propane transformation in the presence of dioxygen in 2 h runs can be seen in Figs. 5 and 6.

The literature discusses the conversion of light paraffins, primarily propane and butane, into aromatic compounds, focusing on the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. It mentions three methods for preparing metal-containing catalysts, including conventional ion-exchange, solid state ion-exchange, and direct synthesis of isomorphously substituted metal silicates. The acidity of the catalysts is determined by pyridine adsorption monitored by IR spectroscopy. The conversion of propane is studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the presence or absence of oxygen. The products are analyzed using GC and GC-MS techniques. The literature also provides conversion and selectivity data for propane transformation in the presence of dioxygen.
