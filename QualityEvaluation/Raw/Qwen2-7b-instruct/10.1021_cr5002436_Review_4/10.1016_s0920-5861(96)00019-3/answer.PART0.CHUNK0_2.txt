The direct conversion of light paraffins (primarily propane and butane) to aromatic compounds is of expanding importance for production of gasoline additives. The UOP/BP Cyclar process using a Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst has been scaled up for industrial operation [1].

As no metallic component is present in Ga/H- ZSM-5 zeolite the oxide component and the acid sites should operate as catalytically active sites [2].

Three different procedures have usually been applied for preparation of metal containing cata- lysts of MFI structure.

(i) Synthesis of isomorphously substituted metal silicates with an appropriate metal content in the framework [8,9].

(ii) In connection with the conventional (liquid phase) ion-exchange it is necessary to mention that the solutions of A13+, Ga 3, In 3+ and T13 ions are stable in acidic media. This fact limits the applicability of the conventional ion-exchange procedure apart from the use of siliceous zeolites such as H-ZSM-5 resistant under acidic circumstances [14].

(iii) The solid state ion-exchange method is the most promising procedure for introducing metal ions into zeolites [15]. In general, an intimate mixture of the respective metal oxide and H-ZSM-5 zeolite is prepared and heat treated by a certain temperature program in oxidative or reductive atmosphere [16].

Metal halides are very rarely used for the preparation of gallium or indium containing cat- alysts [17] although H-ZSM-5 zeolite is resistant to HC1 generated [14]. The most probable expla- nation is the difficult preparation and low stabil- ity of these halides.

Acidity of the samples was determined by pyridine adsorption monitored by IR spec- troscopy. For this purpose self-supported wafers with a thickness of 10 mg/cm 2 were pressed and placed into the sample holder of the IR cell.

The conversion of propane as test reaction was studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the presence or absence of oxygen. Catalyst sam- ples (0.5 g) in a quartz tubular reactor were pretreated in nitrogen flow at 773 K for 2 h to standardize the catalyst surface.

Product analysis was performed by an on-line GC (CHROM-5 equipment) using a Porapack-Q column for the analysis of gaseous products, and a Shimadzu GC-16A chromatograph with a 30 m long SPB-1 capillary column for the anal- ysis of the liquid phase products collected dur- ing the 2 h runs.

The conversion and selectivity data of the propane transformation in the presence of dioxygen in 2 h runs can be seen in Figs. 5 and 6.

The literature discusses the conversion of light paraffins, primarily propane and butane, into aromatic compounds, focusing on the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. It mentions three methods for preparing metal-containing catalysts, including conventional ion-exchange, solid state ion-exchange, and direct synthesis of isomorphously substituted metal silicates. The acidity of the catalysts is determined by pyridine adsorption monitored by IR spectroscopy. The conversion of propane is studied in a fixed-bed flow reactor in the presence or absence of oxygen. The products are analyzed using GC and GC-MS techniques. The literature also provides conversion and selectivity data for propane transformation in the presence of dioxygen.
