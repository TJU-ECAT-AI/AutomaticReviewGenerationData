[1] "These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increasing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by transfer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes."
[2] "In contrast, Berndt et al. (16) showed that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 (<2 wt% Zn, Si/Al = 23) to produce equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2,suggesting that (ZnOH)+ is present."
[3] "Zeolitic Al and Si atoms do not appear as Zn neighbors in the fine structure because of unconstrained vibrations at surface cation exchange sites."
[4] "These extracrystalline ZnO species reduce at about 850 K, as also observed for bulk ZnO."
[5] "Ammonia adsorption measurements indicate that the introduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels leads to a decrease in the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site and is consistent with one Zn2+ cation replacing two protons and interacting with two Al sites."
[6] "Calculations based on the Zn loading from elemental analysis suggest that the number of hydrogen atoms desorbed is in agreement with the theoretical value expected for Zn2+ interacting with two Al sites (OZn2+O)."

1. Zn species enhance propane conversion and selectivity to unsaturated products by boosting propane and propene dehydrogenation rates and preventing hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon fragments for light alkane formation.

2. CO reacts with Zn/H-ZSM5 to yield equal amounts of CO2 and H2, indicating the presence of (ZnOH)+ species.

3. Zeolitic Al and Si atoms are not Zn neighbors due to surface cation exchange site vibrations.

4. Extragranular ZnO reduces at approximately 850 K, akin to bulk ZnO.

5. Ammonia adsorption data confirm that Zn species in ZSM5 channels lower NH3 uptake, aligning with one Zn2+ cation replacing two protons and bonding with two Al sites.

6. Based on Zn loading from elemental analysis, the number of hydrogen atoms desorbed matches expectations for Zn2+ interacting with two Al sites (OZn2+O).

1. 这些金属离子通过提高丙烷和丙烯脱氢速率并避免氢向碳氢化合物碎片转移形成轻烷烃，从而增加丙烷转化率和不饱和产物的选择性。

2. CO与Zn/H-ZSM5反应产生等量的CO2和H2，表明存在(ZnOH)+物种。

3. 硅铝分子筛中的Al和Si原子由于表面阳离子交换位点的振动，不是Zn的邻近原子。

4. 颗粒外的ZnO在约850 K时还原，与块状ZnO一致。

5. 氨吸附数据证实，Zn物种在ZSM5通道中降低NH3吸收量，与一个Zn2+离子替换两个质子并与两个Al位点结合一致。

6. 根据元素分析得出的Zn负载量计算，脱附的氢原子数量与预期的Zn2+与两个Al位点（OZn2+O）相互作用的情况相符。
