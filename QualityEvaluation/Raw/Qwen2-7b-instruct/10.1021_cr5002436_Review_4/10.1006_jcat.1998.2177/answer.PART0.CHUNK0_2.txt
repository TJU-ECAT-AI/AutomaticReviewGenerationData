[1] "In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption studies have shown that Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 14.5, ion exchange) is present as isolated ZnOx species, most likely located at zeolitic exchange sites, with about four oxygen nearest neighbors and without Zn next nearest neighbors."

1. The Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5 is present as isolated ZnOx species, located at zeolitic exchange sites, with about four oxygen nearest neighbors and no Zn next nearest neighbors.
2. Reduction of bulk ZnO starts at 800 K, whereas Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts do not reduce at temperatures above 1173 K.
3. These Zn cations remain as Zn2+ cations and do not reduce to zero-valent species during propane reactions at 773 K.
4. Extracrystalline ZnO forms on samples prepared by impregnation techniques, which are ineffective as catalysts for propane conversion.
5. These bulk ZnO crystals reduce and elute from the bed as Zn vapor during propane reactions.
6. The introduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels decreases the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site, indicating one Zn2+ cation replaces two protons and interacts with two Al sites.
7. The isotopic titration of Brnsted acid sites with D2 confirms the decrease in NH3 adsorption.
8. A reduced amount of hydrogen species is desorbed as HD and H2 on Zn/H-ZSM5, suggesting Zn replaces protons during synthesis.

1.Zn在Zn/H-ZSM5中以孤立的ZnOx物种存在，位于沸石交换位点，有约四个氧邻近原子，并且没有Zn相邻近邻。
2.大量ZnO的还原开始于800 K，而Zn离子在Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂中不会在超过1173 K的温度下还原。
3.这些Zn离子保持为Zn2+离子，并在773 K的丙烷反应中不还原为零价物种。
4.通过浸渍技术制备的样品上形成了额外的结晶性ZnO，这种大量的ZnO晶体作为丙烷转化的催化剂无效。
5.这些大量ZnO晶体在丙烷反应期间还原并从床层蒸发为Zn蒸汽。
6.向ZSM5通道引入Zn物种导致每Al位点吸附的NH3量减少，表明一个Zn2+离子替换两个质子并与两个Al位点相互作用。
7.通过D2的等效位点的等同化确认了NH3吸附的减少。
8.与H-ZSM5相比，Zn/H-ZSM5上脱附的氢物种减少了作为HD和H2，表明Zn在合成过程中替换质子。
