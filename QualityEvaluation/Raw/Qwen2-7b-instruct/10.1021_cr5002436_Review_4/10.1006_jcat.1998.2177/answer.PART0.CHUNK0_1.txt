[1] "These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increasing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by transfer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes."
[2] "The nature of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 was examined by combining site titration and kinetic and isotopic methods with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge."
[3] "These Zn ions remain as Zn2+ cations and do not reduce to zero-valent species during propane reactions at 773 K."
[4] "By analogy with other divalent metal cations, the most probable species from nitrate solution is (ZnOH)+, but this Zn species is not thermally stable."
[5] "Ammonia adsorption measurements indicate that the introduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels leads to a decrease in the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site and is consistent with one Zn2+ cation replacing two protons and interacting with two Al sites."

1. Zn cations increase the rate of propane conversion and selectivity for unsaturated products by enhancing propane and propene dehydrogenation and preventing hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon fragments that would form light alkanes.

2. The characteristics of Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM5 were studied using a combination of site titration, kinetic analysis, isotopic methods, and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Zn K-edge.

3. During propane reactions at 773 K, Zn ions remain as Zn2+ cations without reducing to zero-valence species.

4. The most likely Zn species derived from nitrate solution is (ZnOH)+, though this species is not thermally stable upon heating.

5. Ammonia adsorption tests show that the introduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels reduces the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site, supporting the idea that one Zn2+ cation replaces two protons and interacts with two Al sites.

1. 这些金属离子通过增加丙烷和丙烯的脱氢速率，并避免氢转移至烃碎片形成轻烷烃，提高了丙烷转化率和不饱和产物的选择性。

2. 通过结合位点滴定、动力学分析、同位素方法以及在Zn K-边进行的原位X射线吸收光谱，研究了Zn/H-ZSM5中的Zn物种特性。

3. 在773 K的丙烷反应中，Zn离子保持为Zn2+离子，不会还原为零价物种。

4. 从硝酸溶液中得到的最可能的Zn物种是(ZnOH)+，但该Zn物种在加热时不稳定。

5. 氨吸附测试显示，向ZSM5通道引入Zn物种减少了每Al位点的NH3吸附量，支持一个Zn2+离子取代两个质子并与两个Al位点相互作用的观点。
