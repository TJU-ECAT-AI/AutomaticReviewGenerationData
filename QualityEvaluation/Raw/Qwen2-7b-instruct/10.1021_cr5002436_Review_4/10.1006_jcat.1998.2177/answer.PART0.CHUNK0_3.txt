[1] "On H-ZSM5, propane converts to aromatic products with low selectivity and reacts predominantly to form unwanted cracking products."
[2] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increases the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity."
[3] "In situ Zn K-edge X-ray absorption studies have shown that Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5 (Si/Al = 14.5, ion exchange) is present as isolated ZnOx species, most likely located at zeolitic exchange sites, with about four oxygen nearest neighbors and without Zn next nearest neighbors."
[4] "Temperature-programmed reduction studies indicate that reduction of bulk ZnO begins at 800 K, but Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts do not reduce at temperatures exceeding 1173 K."
[5] "Extracrystalline ZnO forms on samples prepared by impregnation techniques. These bulk ZnO crystals appear to be ineffective as catalysts for propane conversion."
[6] "By analogy with other divalent metal cations, the most probable species from nitrate solution is (ZnOH)+, but this Zn species is not thermally stable."
[7] "Ammonia adsorption measurements indicate that the introduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels leads to a decrease in the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site and is consistent with one Zn2+ cation replacing two protons and interacting with two Al sites."
[8] "The isotopic titration of Brnsted acid sites with D2 confirms these ammonia adsorption measurements. A decreased amount of hydrogen species is desorbed as HD and H2 on Zn/H-ZSM5, when compared with H-ZSM5, indicating that Zn replaces protons during synthesis."

1. Propane conversion on H-ZSM5 is characterized by low selectivity towards aromatic products and high propensity for cracking reactions.
2. Introducing Zn cations into pentasil zeolites enhances the rate of hydrogen release, propane conversion efficiency, and aromatic product selectivity.
3. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Zn in Zn/H-ZSM5 exists as isolated ZnOx species at zeolitic exchange sites, featuring approximately four oxygen neighbors without next-nearest-neighbor Zn atoms.
4. Bulk ZnO starts reducing at 800 K, whereas Zn cations in Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts resist reduction beyond 1173 K.
5. Samples prepared via impregnation technique tend to generate extracrystalline ZnO, which is ineffective for propane conversion.
6. The most likely Zn species derived from nitrate solutions is (ZnOH)+, though it is not thermally stable.
7. Ammonia adsorption data suggest that Zn species in ZSM5 channels cause a reduction in NH3 adsorption per Al site, aligning with one Zn2+ replacing two protons and bonding with two Al sites.
8. Isotopic titration of Brnsted acid sites with D2 validates the ammonia adsorption findings. A lesser amount of hydrogen is desorbed as HD and H2 on Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, implying Zn replaces protons during synthesis.

1. H-ZSM5上的丙烷转化以低芳烃选择性和高裂解产物为主。
2. 将Zn离子引入五元硅沸石中可以提高氢释放速率、丙烷转化率和芳烃产率。
3. 原位X射线吸收光谱显示，Zn在Zn/H-ZSM5中以位于沸石交换位点的孤立ZnOx物种存在，具有大约四个氧邻近原子，没有相邻的Zn原子。
4. 批量ZnO的还原开始于800 K，而Zn离子在Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂中的还原温度不超过1173 K。
5. 通过浸渍技术制备的样品倾向于生成非晶态ZnO，这不适用于丙烷转化。
6. 从硝酸盐溶液中得到的最有可能的Zn物种是(ZnOH)+，但该Zn物种在热力学上不稳定。
7. 氨吸附数据表明，Zn物种在ZSM5通道中导致每Al位点的NH3吸附量减少，符合一个Zn2+取代两个质子并与两个Al位点结合的情况。
8. 同位素滴定Brnsted酸位点与D2验证了氨吸附结果。与H-ZSM5相比，在Zn/H-ZSM5上脱附的氢量较少，作为HD和H2脱附，暗示Zn在合成过程中替代了质子。
