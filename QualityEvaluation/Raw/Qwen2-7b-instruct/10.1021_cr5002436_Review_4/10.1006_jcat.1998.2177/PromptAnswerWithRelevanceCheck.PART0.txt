[1] "These metal cations increase propane conversion rates and the selectivity to unsaturated products by increasing the rate of propane and propene dehydrogenation and by avoiding the preferential removal of hydrogen by transfer to hydrocarbon fragments to form light alkanes."
[2] "In contrast, Berndt et al. (16) showed that CO reacts on Zn/H-ZSM5 (<2 wt% Zn, Si/Al = 23) to produce equimolar amounts of CO2 and H2,suggesting that (ZnOH)+ is present."
[3] "Zeolitic Al and Si atoms do not appear as Zn neighbors in the fine structure because of unconstrained vibrations at surface cation exchange sites."
[4] "These extracrystalline ZnO species reduce at about 850 K, as also observed for bulk ZnO."
[5] "Ammonia adsorption measurements indicate that the introduction of Zn species into ZSM5 channels leads to a decrease in the amount of NH3 adsorbed per Al site and is consistent with one Zn2+ cation replacing two protons and interacting with two Al sites."
[6] "Calculations based on the Zn loading from elemental analysis suggest that the number of hydrogen atoms desorbed is in agreement with the theoretical value expected for Zn2+ interacting with two Al sites (OZn2+O)."
