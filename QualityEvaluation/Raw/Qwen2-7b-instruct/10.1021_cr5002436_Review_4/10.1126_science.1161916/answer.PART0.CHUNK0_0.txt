The document discusses the possibility of creating a time-reversing sheet that can achieve subwavelength resolution, similar to a negatively refracting lens. This concept applies to any waves, including electromagnetic and acoustic waves. The discussion involves a two-step process where a transition occurs from +w to w, followed by a second transition from 0 to w. The paper also mentions the potential of reversing the sign of refraction in a positively refracting medium by coating the surface with a phase-reversing sheet, leading to the possibility of curved lenses that can magnify an object. However, the document notes that the three-dimensional nature of the hologram used in this process precludes achieving subwavelength resolution.

文档讨论了创建能够实现亚波长分辨率的时间反转层的可能性，类似于负折射透镜。这一概念适用于任何波，包括电磁波和声波。讨论涉及一个两步过程，在其中从+w到+w发生转换，然后是第二个从0到+w的转换。论文还提到，通过在表面涂覆相位反转层来反转正折射介质中的折射符号的可能性，这导致了能够放大物体的曲面透镜的可能性。然而，文档指出，用于此过程的三维全息图的性质排除了实现亚波长分辨率的可能性。
