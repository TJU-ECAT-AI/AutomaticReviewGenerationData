The unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions is attributed to their ability to modify the surface chemistry and induce oxidative processes. The catalytic mechanisms are influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts include the potential to create more active and selective catalysts with enhanced performance.

In the context of subwavelength resolution, any medium with positive refraction can have its sign reversed by applying a phase-reversing sheet to its surface. This principle applies not only to electromagnetic waves but also to acoustic waves, where time-reversal studies are well-developed. To realize a two-step process for achieving subwavelength resolution, one could use a four-wave mixing experiment, where a counterpropagating pump beam writes a hologram and a second pump beam reads it, producing a time-reversed signal.

To enhance the nonlinearity of existing media, potentially through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial layers to boost local fields, might offer a pathway to creating a 2D hologram, which could lead to subwavelength resolution. Practical considerations for implementing a four-wave mixing scheme are further discussed in the Supporting Online Material (SOM).

碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳，在烷烃脱氢反应中的意外催化活性归因于它们对表面化学的修改并引发氧化过程。催化机制受温度和表面化学等因素的影响。这一现象对于新型高效碳基催化剂的发展的潜在影响包括创造更活跃且选择性更高的催化剂，性能得到增强。

在亚波长分辨率的背景下，任何具有正折射率的介质都可以通过在其表面应用相位反转层来反转其折射率的符号。这一原理不仅适用于电磁波，也适用于声波，其中时间反转研究已经得到充分发展。为了实现两步过程以获得亚波长分辨率，可以使用四波混合同步实验，其中一个反向传播的泵束写入全息图，第二个泵束读取全息图，产生时间反转信号。

为了增强现有介质的非线性，可能通过使用等离子体或超材料层来提升局部场，可能提供了一条实现二维全息图并因此实现亚波长分辨率的途径。对于实施四波混合同步方案的实践考虑在补充在线材料（SOM）中进一步讨论。
