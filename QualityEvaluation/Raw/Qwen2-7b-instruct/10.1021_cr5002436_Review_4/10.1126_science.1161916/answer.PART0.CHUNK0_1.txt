[2] "A scheme for subwavelength resolution was also proposed in (9) but, as noted above, this scheme depended on the existence of surface states derived from a mathematically postulated boundary for which no physical realization has so far been suggested."
[3] "At optical frequencies, perhaps the best system for the realization of these ideas is a four-wave mixing experiment."
[4] "Our original discussion (illustrated in Fig. 2) assumes a single-step transition from +w to w."
[5] "Such processes occur but are very weak."
[6] "As a generalization of the analogy, any positively refracting medium can have the sign of its refraction reversed by coating the surface with a phase-reversing sheet."
[7] "This leads to the possibility of curved lenses that can magnify an object."
[8] "In principle, our new lens can be realized if the hologram is written in a thin sheet of nonlinear material."
[9] "However, the 3D nature of the hologram precludes any subwavelength resolution."
[10] "Creating a 2D hologram and attaining the ideal shown in Fig. 3 will be a challenge."
[11] "Enhancing the nonlinearity of existing media possibly through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial layers to enhance the local fields may offer a route to realizing a 2D version and hence subwavelength resolution."

The document discusses the potential for achieving subwavelength resolution using time-reversing sheets and analogous methods involving negatively refracting media. It mentions the possibility of creating curved lenses capable of magnifying objects and suggests that enhancing the nonlinearity of existing media through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial layers could lead to a 2D hologram, which might enable subwavelength resolution. However, the document also notes that the 3D nature of the holograms currently used in this context prevents subwavelength resolution.

该文档讨论了使用时间反转层和负折射介质类比方法实现亚波长分辨率的可能性。它提到了可以创建能够放大物体的曲面透镜的可能，并指出，通过使用等离子体或 metamaterial 层增强现有媒体的局部场强度，有可能实现二维全息图，这可能使亚波长分辨率成为可能。然而，文档也指出，当前使用的全息图的三维性质阻止了亚波长分辨率。
