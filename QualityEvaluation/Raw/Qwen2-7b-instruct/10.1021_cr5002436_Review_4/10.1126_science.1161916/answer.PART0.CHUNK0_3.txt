[1] "Enhancing the nonlinearity of existing media possibly through the use of plasmonic or metamaterial layers to enhance the local fields (17) may offer a route to realizing a 2D version and hence sub-wavelength resolution."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Increasing the nonlinearity of existing media, potentially via plasmonic or metamaterial layers to boost local fields, might lead to achieving a 2D version and thus sub-wavelength resolution.
