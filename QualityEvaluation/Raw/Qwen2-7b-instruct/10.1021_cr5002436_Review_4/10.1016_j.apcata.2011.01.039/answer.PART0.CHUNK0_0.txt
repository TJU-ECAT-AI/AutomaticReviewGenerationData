[1] "In this study, propane dehydrogenation experiments are carried out on PtSn catalyst at different temperatures and with different inlet propane, propene and hydrogen concentrations. A reaction kinetic model of propane dehydrogenation including cracking and deactivation is established following the LH approach. The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step. The underline reac- tion mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the kinetic model agrees with experiments and quantum chemistry calcula- tions."
[2] "The kinetic model of coke formation taking into account the effects of propene and hydrogen is integrated into the deacti- vation model. The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke forma- tion and thus deactivation. The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed."
[3] "The changes of propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions are well predicted by the deac- tivation model. The strategy for kinetic modeling employed in the present work is to directly integrate the coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, making it possible to avoid measurement of coke content in situ. It makes the modeling relatively simple but still keeps a good predictive capability."

1. The rate-determining step in propane dehydrogenation on the PtSn catalyst is the first CH bond cleavage in the propane molecule. This step is in agreement with experimental observations and quantum chemistry calculations.

2. Propene is identified as the main precursor for coke formation during the dehydrogenation process. Hydrogen is found to suppress coke formation and, consequently, catalyst deactivation.

3. The kinetic model effectively predicts the changes in propane conversion over time under various operating conditions. The strategy employed in this work integrates the coke formation kinetic model directly into the deactivation model, enabling accurate prediction without the need for in-situ coke content measurement. This approach maintains simplicity while ensuring robust predictive capability.

1. 烷基化过程在铂锡催化剂上的速率决定步骤是丙烷分子中第一个C-H键的断裂。这一步骤与实验观测和量子化学计算结果一致。

2. 丙烯被确认为焦炭形成的主要前体。氢气被发现可以抑制焦炭形成，从而减缓催化剂失活。

3. 该动力学模型能够准确预测在不同操作条件下丙烷转化率随时间的变化。本工作中采用的策略直接将焦炭形成动力学模型整合到失活模型中，无需进行原位焦炭含量测量即可实现精确预测。这种方法保持了模型的简单性同时保持了良好的预测能力。
