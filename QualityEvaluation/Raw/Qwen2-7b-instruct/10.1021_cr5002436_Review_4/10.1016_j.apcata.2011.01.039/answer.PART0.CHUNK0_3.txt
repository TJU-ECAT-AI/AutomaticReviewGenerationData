[1] "Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt -Sn/Al2O3 are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigorosity of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
[3] "The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen."
[4] "Finally a complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions."
[5] "The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke formation and thus deactivation."

The kinetic models for propane dehydrogenation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are proposed based on the consideration of one-step or two-step dehydrogenation mechanisms. The step-wise dehydrogenation model, where the first step is the rate-determining step and with low surface coverage of C3H7, is found to outperform other models based on fitting accuracy, number of fitting parameters, and the rigor of the reaction mechanism. The catalyst activity changes over time are linked to the rate of coke formation, which is influenced by the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. A complete kinetic model, incorporating propane dehydrogenation, cracking, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, is developed. This model well predicts the changes in propane conversion over time under various operational conditions. It is found that propene acts as the primary precursor for coke formation, while hydrogen inhibits this process and consequently affects catalyst deactivation.

针对Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂的丙烷脱氢动力学模型，基于一步或两步脱氢机制的考虑而提出。分步脱氢模型，其中第一步是决定性步骤，并且表面覆盖的C3H7较低，被认为优于其他模型。基于拟合精度、参数数量和反应机制的严格性的考虑，这种模型表现出色。催化剂活性随时间的变化与焦炭形成速率有关，后者受丙烯和氢气分压的影响。开发了一个完整的动力学模型，包括丙烷脱氢、裂解以及由于焦炭沉积导致的催化剂失活。该模型能够很好地预测在不同操作条件下丙烷转化率随时间的变化。研究发现，丙烯是焦炭形成的主要前体，而氢气则抑制这一过程并进而影响催化剂失活。
