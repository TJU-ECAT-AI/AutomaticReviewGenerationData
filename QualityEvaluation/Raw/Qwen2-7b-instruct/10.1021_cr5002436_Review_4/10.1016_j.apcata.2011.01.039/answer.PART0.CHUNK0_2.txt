1. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are proposed based on the reaction mechanisms considering one-step or two-step dehydrogenation processes. These models are evaluated by fitting experimental data. 

2. The first carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage in the propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Propene is recognized as the primary precursor for coke formation, whereas hydrogen reduces coke formation and consequently deactivation.

4. The kinetic model effectively describes the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, linking it to the rate of coke formation. It considers the fact that propene promotes coke formation while hydrogen suppresses it.

1. 根据单步或两步脱氢的反应机制，基于兰缪尔-希谢尔伍德模型对Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢进行催化提出了动力学模型。这些模型通过拟合实验数据进行评估。

2. 丙烷分子中第一个碳-氢键断裂被识别为决定性步骤。

3. 丙烯被确认为焦炭形成的主要前体，而氢气则抑制了焦炭形成和由此导致的催化剂失活。

4. 该动力学模型有效地描述了催化剂失活的动态过程，将它与焦炭形成速率相关联，并考虑到丙烯促进焦炭形成而氢气抑制这一事实。
