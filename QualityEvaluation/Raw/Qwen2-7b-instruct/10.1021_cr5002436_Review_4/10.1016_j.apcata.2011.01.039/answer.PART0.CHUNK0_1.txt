[1] "LangmuirHinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt -Sn/Al2O3 are pro- posed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigorousness of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
[3] "The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen."
[4] "A complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions."
[5] "Direct measurement of coke formation is avoided by the approach employed in this study for the prediction of catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are proposed based on considering one-step or two-step dehydrogenation processes. These models are evaluated by fitting experimental data, taking into account fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters, and the rigor of the reaction mechanism. The step-wise dehydrogenation model, with the first step as the rate-determining step and low surface coverage of C3H7, outperforms other models. The catalyst activity over time is influenced by the rate of coke formation, which depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. A complete kinetic model that includes propane dehydrogenation, cracking, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is developed. This model accurately predicts the changes in propane conversion over time under various operating conditions. The approach avoids direct measurement of coke formation for predicting catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition.

基于一步或两步脱氢过程，提出了Langmuir-Hinshelwood催化丙烷脱氢的Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂动力学模型，并通过拟合实验数据进行评估，考虑拟合精度、参数数量和反应机制的严谨性。假设单步脱氢、第一步为决定性步骤以及C3H7表面覆盖度低的动力学模型优于其他模型。催化剂活性随时间的变化受到焦炭形成速率的影响，该速率取决于丙烯和氢气的分压。开发了一个完整的动力学模型，包括丙烷脱氢、裂解和由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。该模型能够准确预测在不同操作条件下丙烷转化率随时间的变化。这种方法避免了直接测量焦炭形成来预测由焦炭沉积引起的催化剂失活。
