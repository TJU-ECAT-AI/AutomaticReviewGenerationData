How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?

[1] "In this study, propane dehydrogenation experiments are carried out on PtSn catalyst at different temperatures and with different inlet propane, propene and hydrogen concentrations. A reaction kinetic model of propane dehydrogenation including cracking and deactivation is established following the LH approach. The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is identified as the rate-determining step. The underline reac- tion mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the kinetic model agrees with experiments and quantum chemistry calcula- tions."
[2] "The kinetic model of coke formation taking into account the effects of propene and hydrogen is integrated into the deacti- vation model. The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke forma- tion and thus deactivation. The model describes well the kinetics of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed."
[3] "The changes of propane conversion with time-on-stream under different operating conditions are well predicted by the deac- tivation model. The strategy for kinetic modeling employed in the present work is to directly integrate the coking formation kinetic model into the deactivation model, making it possible to avoid measurement of coke content in situ. It makes the modeling relatively simple but still keeps a good predictive capability."

1. The rate-determining step in propane dehydrogenation on the PtSn catalyst is the first CH bond cleavage in the propane molecule. This step is in agreement with experimental observations and quantum chemistry calculations.

2. Propene is identified as the main precursor for coke formation during the dehydrogenation process. Hydrogen is found to suppress coke formation and, consequently, catalyst deactivation.

3. The kinetic model effectively predicts the changes in propane conversion over time under various operating conditions. The strategy employed in this work integrates the coke formation kinetic model directly into the deactivation model, enabling accurate prediction without the need for in-situ coke content measurement. This approach maintains simplicity while ensuring robust predictive capability.

[1] "LangmuirHinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt -Sn/Al2O3 are pro- posed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigorousness of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
[3] "The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen."
[4] "A complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions."
[5] "Direct measurement of coke formation is avoided by the approach employed in this study for the prediction of catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."

The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are proposed based on considering one-step or two-step dehydrogenation processes.

The step-wise dehydrogenation model, with the first step as the rate-determining step and low surface coverage of C3H7, outperforms other models. The catalyst activity over time is influenced by the rate of coke formation, which depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. A complete kinetic model that includes propane dehydrogenation, cracking, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is developed. This model accurately predicts the changes in propane conversion over time under various operating conditions. The approach avoids direct measurement of coke formation for predicting catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition.
