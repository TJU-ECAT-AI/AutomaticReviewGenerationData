[1] "LangmuirHinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt -Sn/Al2O3 are pro- posed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation and are evaluated by fitting the experiments."
[2] "When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the number of fitting parameters and the rigorousness of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models."
[3] "The change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen."
[4] "A complete kinetic model, which includes propane dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating conditions."

1. Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are proposed based on considering one-step or two-step dehydrogenation. These models are evaluated by fitting experimental data. Among the models, the one assuming step-wise dehydrogenation, with the first step as the rate-determining step and low surface coverage of C3H7, outperforms others based on fitting accuracy, number of fitting parameters, and reaction mechanism rigor.

2. The catalyst activity changes with time-on-stream are related to the rate of coke formation, which is influenced by the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. 

3. A comprehensive kinetic model that includes propane dehydrogenation, cracking, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is developed. This model well predicts the propane conversion changes over time under various operating conditions.

1. 根据考虑单步或两步脱氢的原理，基于Langmuir-Hinshelwood模型为Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出了动力学模型。这些模型通过拟合实验数据进行评估。在考虑拟合精度、参数数量和反应机制严谨性的基础上，假设分步脱氢、第一步作为速率决定步骤以及C3H7低表面覆盖度的模型优于其他模型。

2. 催化剂活性随时间变化与焦炭形成速率有关，后者受到丙烯和氢气分压的影响。

3. 一个全面的动力学模型被开发出来，该模型包括丙烷脱氢、裂解以及由于焦炭沉积导致的催化剂失活。此模型能够很好地预测在不同操作条件下随时间变化的丙烷转化率。
