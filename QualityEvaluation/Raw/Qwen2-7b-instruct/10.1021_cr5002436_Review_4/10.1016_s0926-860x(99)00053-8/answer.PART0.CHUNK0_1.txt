The document discusses the catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The materials were synthesized by reacting metal oxides with ammonia or a methane/hydrogen mixture. These materials showed mesoporous structures with surface areas reaching up to 81 m2/g. The catalytic activities varied significantly, with Group VI metals being more active than Group V metals. The b-W2N catalyst showed a high isomerization selectivity, likely due to oxygen presence on its surface. The lattice structure influenced activity, with hexagonal WC being more active than face-centered cubic WC1x despite similar C/W ratios. The metal atom type had the most significant impact on activity and selectivity, with Group VI compounds catalyzing hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation more efficiently than Group V compounds. The vanadium compounds showed high dehydrogenation selectivities, exceeding 98%. The mechanism for butane hydrogenolysis was found to be similar across the nitrides and carbides, with a preference for hydrogenolysis at the central CC bond, except for the Mo2C catalyst which showed equal frequencies at the central and terminal CC bonds. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst favored hydrogenolysis at the terminal CC bond.

文档讨论了早期过渡金属氮化物和碳化物在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化性能。通过将金属氧化物与氨或甲烷/氢混合物反应合成这些材料。这些材料显示出介孔结构，表面面积可达81 m2/g。催化活性差异显著，VI族金属比V族金属更活跃。b-W2N催化剂表现出高的异构化选择性，可能是因为其表面存在氧。晶格结构对活性有影响，六方WC比面心立方WC1x更活跃，尽管它们的C/W比例相似。金属原子类型对活性和选择性的影响最大，VI族化合物在氢解和脱氢方面比V族化合物更有效率。范德华化合物显示出超过98%的脱氢选择性。机制上，所有氮化物和碳化物的丁烷氢解过程类似，主要在中央CC键处进行氢解，除了Mo2C催化剂，在中央和末端CC键处具有相等的频率。PtSn/Al2O3催化剂倾向于在末端CC键处进行氢解。
