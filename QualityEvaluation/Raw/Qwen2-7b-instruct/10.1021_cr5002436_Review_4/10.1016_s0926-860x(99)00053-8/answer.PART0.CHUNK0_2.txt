The various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique surface chemistry and structure. The proposed mechanisms involve the ability of these materials to activate alkane molecules through the formation of reactive intermediates, leading to the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds and the production of olefins. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of these reactions, as it affects the energy required to overcome activation barriers and the stability of intermediate states. Surface chemistry, including the presence of functional groups and defects, influences the selectivity of the catalytic process, directing the reaction pathways towards desired products such as olefins rather than paraffins. The implications of this phenomenon are significant for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional metal-based catalysts. The enhanced activity and selectivity of carbon-based catalysts could lead to improved yields and reduced environmental impact in industries such as petrochemical processing and renewable energy applications.
