The catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides were extensively studied, particularly their roles in alkane hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. These materials showed varying activities, with the Group VI compounds being notably more active than the Group V compounds. The lattice structure significantly influenced their performance, yet the impact of the non-metal atom type was relatively minor. Despite differences in their electronic structures, the mechanism governing the hydrogenolysis of butane was found to be quite similar across the nitrides and carbides. This research provided insights into the development of efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane conversion reactions.
