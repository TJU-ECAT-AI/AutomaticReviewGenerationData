The catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides were extensively studied, particularly their roles in alkane hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. These materials showed varying activities, with the Group VI compounds being notably more active than the Group V compounds. The lattice structure significantly influenced their performance, yet the impact of the non-metal atom type was relatively minor. Despite differences in their electronic structures, the mechanism governing the hydrogenolysis of butane was found to be quite similar across the nitrides and carbides. This research provided insights into the development of efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane conversion reactions.

The document discusses the catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The materials were synthesized by reacting metal oxides with ammonia or a methane/hydrogen mixture. These materials showed mesoporous structures with surface areas reaching up to 81 m2/g. The catalytic activities varied significantly, with Group VI metals being more active than Group V metals. The b-W2N catalyst showed a high isomerization selectivity, likely due to oxygen presence on its surface. The lattice structure influenced activity, with hexagonal WC being more active than face-centered cubic WC1x despite similar C/W ratios. The metal atom type had the most significant impact on activity and selectivity, with Group VI compounds catalyzing hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation more efficiently than Group V compounds. The vanadium compounds showed high dehydrogenation selectivities, exceeding 98%. The mechanism for butane hydrogenolysis was found to be similar across the nitrides and carbides, with a preference for hydrogenolysis at the central CC bond, except for the Mo2C catalyst which showed equal frequencies at the central and terminal CC bonds. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst favored hydrogenolysis at the terminal CC bond.

The various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique surface chemistry and structure. The proposed mechanisms involve the ability of these materials to activate alkane molecules through the formation of reactive intermediates, leading to the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds and the production of olefins. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of these reactions, as it affects the energy required to overcome activation barriers and the stability of intermediate states. Surface chemistry, including the presence of functional groups and defects, influences the selectivity of the catalytic process, directing the reaction pathways towards desired products such as olefins rather than paraffins. The implications of this phenomenon are significant for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional metal-based catalysts. The enhanced activity and selectivity of carbon-based catalysts could lead to improved yields and reduced environmental impact in industries such as petrochemical processing and renewable energy applications.

碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性，这是由于它们独特的表面化学性质和结构。这些材料通过形成活性中间体激活烷烃分子，导致碳-碳键断裂并产生烯烃。温度在决定这些反应效率方面起着关键作用，因为它影响了克服活化能壁垒所需的能量以及中间状态的稳定性。表面化学，包括功能性基团和缺陷的存在，影响催化过程的选择性，引导反应途径以产生所需的产品（如烯烃）而不是饱和烷烃。这种现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义，提供了一种可持续的替代传统金属基催化剂的方法。碳基催化剂的增强活性和选择性可能导致更高的产率和降低环境影响，在石油化工处理和可再生能源应用等工业领域有着广泛的应用前景。

Catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides:n-butane hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation and isomerization
M.K. Neylon, S. Choi, H. Kwon, K.E. Curry1, L.T. Thompson*
Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2136, USA Received 3 August 1998; received in revised form 18 February 1999; accepted 21 February 1999 Abstract Phase-pure early transition metal nitrides and carbides were prepared via the temperature programmed reaction of metal oxides with NH3 or a CH4/H2 mixture. The nitrides and carbides were mostly mesoporous with surface areas up to 81 m2/g.
Their gravimetric butane conversion rates were generally higher than those for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Activities for the nitrides and carbides ranged from 0.41012 to 101012 molecules/cm2 s at 723 K and decreased as follows: g- Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92.

Various carbon-based materials, such as nitrides and carbides of early transition metals, showed high catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization reactions. The activity and selectivity of these materials were influenced by the metal atom type, with Group VI metals being more active than Group V metals. The most active materials were found to be molybdenum nitrides (Mo2N) and tungsten carbides (WC), followed by tungsten nitrides (W2N), and vanadium compounds (VN). The lattice structure also played a significant role, with hexagonal tungsten carbides being more active than face-centered cubic ones. The effect of the non-metal atom type was considered insignificant. The high catalytic activity of these materials was attributed to differences in their electronic structures.
