[2] "The nitrides and carbides were mostly mesoporous with surface areas up to 81 m2/g."
[3] "Their gravimetric butane conversion rates were generally higher than those for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "Activities for the nitrides and carbides ranged from 0.41012 to 101012 molecules/cm2 s at 723 K and decreased as follows: g- Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92."
[5] "The Group VI metal nitrides and carbides were much more active than the Group V metal compounds."

[7] "The b-W2N catalyst also catalyzed butane isomerization possibly as a consequence of the presence of oxygen on the surface."
