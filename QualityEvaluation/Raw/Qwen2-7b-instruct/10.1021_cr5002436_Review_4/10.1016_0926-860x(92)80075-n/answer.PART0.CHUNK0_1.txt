[1] "The nature of the active gallium species ( Ga203, Ga,O, Ga+, etc.) is difficult to determine in particular because of activation and deactivation phenomena of the catalysts in the presence of hydrogen (hence during aromatization)."
[2] "More investigations are needed to understand these phenomena, their effect on the acid and dehydrogenating sites and on the aro- matization activity and selectivity."
[3] "The higher aromatic/ (methane + ethane ) ratio was obtained with gallosilicates or galloaluminosilicates steamed under mild conditions and which had highly dispersed and active gal- lium species."

The active gallium species in GaMFI catalysts, which are used for alkane aromatization, can be Ga2O3, GaO, or Ga+. However, determining their exact nature is challenging due to changes in the catalysts' properties during activation and deactivation processes, especially when hydrogen is present. More research is required to fully understand these changes and their impact on the acidity and dehydrogenation sites, as well as on the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity towards aromatics. Gallosilicates or galloaluminosilicates, when steamed under mild conditions, have demonstrated a higher dispersed and active gallium species, leading to a greater aromatic/(methane + ethane) ratio.

活性镓物种在GaMFI催化剂中的确切性质难以确定，特别是当存在氢气时，催化剂的激活和失活现象。需要更多的研究来完全理解这些变化及其对酸性和脱氢化位点的影响，以及对芳香化活性和选择性的影响。在温和条件下蒸煮的Gallosilicates或Galloaluminosilicates显示出更高分散且活性较高的镓物种，导致更高的芳香物/(甲烷 + 乙烷)比。
