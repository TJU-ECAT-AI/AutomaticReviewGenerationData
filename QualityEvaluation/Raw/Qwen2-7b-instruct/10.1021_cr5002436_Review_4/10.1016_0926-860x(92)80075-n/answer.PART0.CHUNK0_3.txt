[1] "The reaction pathway of propane aromatization comprises numerous successive steps. Our objective is to show on different MFI catalysts what are the steps involved in this pathway and how they occur."
[2] "The initial rate of propene formation is furthermore about 4 times higher on H-ZSM-5 impregnated with 6 wt.-% Ga (6 GaH-ZSM-5) than on H-ZSM-5."
[3] "Obviously the relative participation of gallium species and of acid sites in the production of aromatics from naphthenes can also be estimated from the number of hydrogen moles formed per mole of aromatic during propane transformation."
[4] "This leads to a more appropriate combina- tion of the acid and dehydrogenating activities and to a closer proximity of gallium species and acid sites."

1. The propane aromatization pathway involves multiple sequential steps, and the aim is to demonstrate these steps and their occurrence on various MFI catalysts.

2. The rate of propene formation is notably higher on H-ZSM-5 impregnated with 6 wt.-% gallium (6 GaH-ZSM-5) compared to plain H-ZSM-5, about 4 times faster.

3. The relative contribution of gallium species versus acid sites in the production of aromatics from naphthenes can also be quantified based on the number of hydrogen moles produced per mole of aromatic during propane transformation.

4. This improved combination of acid and dehydrogenating activities, along with a closer proximity of gallium species and acid sites, results in enhanced catalytic performance.

1. 烯烃异构化路径涉及多个连续步骤，目标是通过不同MFI催化剂展示这些步骤及其发生过程。

2. 含有6 wt.-%镓（6 GaH-ZSM-5）的H-ZSM-5在丙烷异构化速率上明显高于纯H-ZSM-5，快约4倍。

3. 可以根据在丙烷转换过程中每摩尔芳香烃产生的氢分子数来定量地估算镓物种与酸性位点在从环烷基中间体生成芳香族化合物时的相对贡献。

4. 这种酸性和脱氢活性的更佳组合，以及镓物种与酸性位点之间的更近距离，导致了催化性能的提升。
