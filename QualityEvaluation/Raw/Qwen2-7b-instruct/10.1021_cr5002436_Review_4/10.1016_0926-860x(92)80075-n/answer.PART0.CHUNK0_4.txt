[1] "GaMFI catalysts are very active for the production of aromatics and hydro- gen from short-chain alkanes. Economically the interest of this process de- pends obviously on the relative costs of light alkanes and of aromatics and hydrogen."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The economic interest in the alkane aromatization process relies on the cost comparison between light alkanes and the produced aromatics and hydrogen.

<quotes>

[1] "The nature of the active gallium species ( Ga203, Ga,O, Ga+, etc.) is difficult to determine in particular because of activation and deactivation phenomena of the catalysts in the presence of hydrogen (hence during aromatization)."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The nature of the active gallium species (like Ga203, Ga,O, Ga+) is hard to pinpoint, especially due to activation and deactivation effects of catalysts in the presence of hydrogen during the aromatization process.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

活性镓物种（如Ga203、Ga,O、Ga+等）的性质难以确定，特别是在氢气存在下催化剂的激活和失活现象期间的芳香化过程中。

[1] "The selectivity to aromatics is greater with MFI gallosilicates than with the other gallium catalysts while the selectivity to methane+ethane is lower at least at high conversion."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Gallosilicates of the MFI type show a higher selectivity for aromatics compared to other gallium catalysts, while their selectivity for methane+ethane is lower, especially at high conversion rates.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

MFI型加洛硅酸盐的芳选择性高于其他镓催化剂，而对甲烷+乙烷的选择性在至少高转化率时较低。

<quotes>

[1] "A greater value of this ratio was also found at 100% conversion in the Cyclar process with n-butane (2.25) compared with propane (1.9), the yields in aromatics being equal to 67.5% and to 63.6%, respectively."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

In the Cyclar process, a higher ratio was observed for n-butane (2.25) at 100% conversion compared to propane (1.9), with equal aromatic yields of 67.5% for n-butane and 63.6% for propane.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

在Cyclar过程中，在100%转化率下，与丙烷相比，异丁烷（2.25）的这一比例更高，分别为2.25和1.9，相应的芳烃产率为67.5%，而丙烷为63.6%。

[1] "The nature of the active gallium species ( Ga203, Ga,O, Ga+, etc.) is difficult to determine in particular because of activation and deactivation phenomena of the catalysts in the presence of hydrogen (hence during aromatization)."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The identity of the active gallium species (like Ga203, Ga,O, Ga+) is hard to ascertain, particularly given the activation and deactivation dynamics of the catalysts in the presence of hydrogen (thus during the aromatization).

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

活性镓物种（如Ga203、Ga,O、Ga+等）的性质难以确定，特别是考虑到氢气存在的催化剂激活和失活现象（因此在芳香化过程中）。
