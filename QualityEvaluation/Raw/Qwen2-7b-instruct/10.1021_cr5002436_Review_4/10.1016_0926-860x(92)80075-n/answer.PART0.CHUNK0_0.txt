[1] "GaMFI catalysts are very active for the production of aromatics and hydro- gen from short-chain alkanes. Economically the interest of this process de- pends obviously on the relative costs of light alkanes and of aromatics and hydrogen."
[2] "The aromatization process would become economically more at- tractive if the production of unwanted products (methane and ethane) could be reduced."
[3] "From propane and butanes C!,and C, products result mainly from the cracking of the reactant on the catalysts acid sites."
[4] "The research must therefore be focused on the ways for decreasing or even suppressing this un- desirable reaction: e.g. choice of the dehydrogenating sites (bimetallic ), opti- mal balance of the dehydrogenating and acid functions and optimal distribu- tion of the corresponding sites within the zeolite."

1. GaMFI catalysts efficiently produce aromatics and hydrogen from short-chain alkanes, with economic viability dependent on the cost comparison between light alkanes, aromatics, and hydrogen.
2. Enhancing the process economics would require minimizing the production of undesired methane and ethane.
3. Products from propane and butanes primarily originate from cracking reactions on the catalyst's acid sites.
4. Research should concentrate on strategies to reduce or eliminate these undesirable reactions, such as selecting dual-function sites, achieving an optimal balance between dehydrogenating and acid functionalities, and distributing these functions effectively within the zeolite.

1. GaMFI 催化剂能够高效地从短链烷烃中生产芳烃和氢气，其经济可行性取决于轻烷烃、芳烃和氢气的成本对比。
2. 提高过程经济效益需要减少或消除副产品甲烷和乙烷的生成。
3. 丙烷和丁烷的主要产物源自催化剂酸性位点上的裂解反应。
4. 研究应集中在减少或消除这些不期望反应的方法上，例如选择双功能位点、实现去氢化与酸性功能之间的最佳平衡，并在沸石内部有效分配这些功能。
