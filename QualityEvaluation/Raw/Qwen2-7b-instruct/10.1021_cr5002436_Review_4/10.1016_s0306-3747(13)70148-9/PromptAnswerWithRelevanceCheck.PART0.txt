The global demand for carbon black is projected to experience significant growth until 2019, with an estimated increase of over 3.1 million tonnes compared to 2011 levels. Tyres account for the largest portion of consumption, having consumed more than 7.8 million tonnes in 2011. In addition to being used in the production of tyres, carbon black serves as a pigment in various industrial sectors including plastics, paints, varnishes, and printing inks. The automotive industry stands out as the primary market for carbon black, significantly impacting the tyre segment and the broader rubber product industry. Asia Pacific, particularly China, is expected to lead market growth with consumption and production volumes increasing at a rate exceeding 4.5% annually. China alone consumes more than 30% of the global carbon black market. Manufacturers face margin pressure, leading to forecasts of increased consolidation and localized production in individual countries.

Carbon black demand is anticipated to experience dynamic growth until 2019, with the market volume projected to expand by over 3.1 million tonnes from 2011 levels. Tyres account for the largest consumption segment, having consumed more than 7.8 million tonnes in 2011. Asia Pacific is driving this growth, with consumption and production volumes expected to increase by more than 4.5% annually. China, in particular, consumes over 30% of the global carbon black market volume, and its substantial growth will lead to the region becoming a net exporter. Production costs and carbon black prices are significantly influenced by crude oil prices, which saw a substantial rise from $27/barrel in 2003 to over $108/barrel in 2011, resulting in a nearly 130% increase in carbon black prices during the same period.
