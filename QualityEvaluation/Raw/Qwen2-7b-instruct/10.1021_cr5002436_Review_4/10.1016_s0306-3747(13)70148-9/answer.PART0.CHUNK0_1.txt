Carbon black demand is anticipated to experience dynamic growth until 2019, with the market volume projected to expand by over 3.1 million tonnes from 2011 levels. Tyres account for the largest consumption segment, having consumed more than 7.8 million tonnes in 2011. Asia Pacific is driving this growth, with consumption and production volumes expected to increase by more than 4.5% annually. China, in particular, consumes over 30% of the global carbon black market volume, and its substantial growth will lead to the region becoming a net exporter. Production costs and carbon black prices are significantly influenced by crude oil prices, which saw a substantial rise from $27/barrel in 2003 to over $108/barrel in 2011, resulting in a nearly 130% increase in carbon black prices during the same period.

碳黑的需求预计将在2019年前实现动态增长，市场容量预计将从2011年的水平增加超过310万吨。轮胎是最大的消费领域，2011年消耗了超过780万吨。亚太地区是增长的主要驱动力，预计该地区的消费和生产量每年将增加超过4.5%。中国占全球碳黑市场份额超过30%，其显著增长将使该地区成为净出口国。生产成本和碳黑价格主要受原油价格的影响，从2003年的每桶27美元上涨到2011年的超过108美元，导致碳黑价格在相同期间几乎增加了130%。
