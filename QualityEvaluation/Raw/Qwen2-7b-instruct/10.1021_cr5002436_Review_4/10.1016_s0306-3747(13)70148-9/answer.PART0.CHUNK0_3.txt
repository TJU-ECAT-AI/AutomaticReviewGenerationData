Carbon black demand is anticipated to surge dynamically until 2019, with market volume projected to expand by over 3.1 million tonnes from 2011 levels. The tire industry consumes the majority of carbon black, accounting for more than 7.8 million tonnes in 2011. This material is also utilized as a pigment in various sectors like plastics, paints, varnishes, and printing inks. The automotive sector drives the carbon black market, with manufacturers benefiting from the automotive market's robust performance over the last eight years. Asia Pacific, particularly China, is set to increase consumption and production volumes by more than 4.5% annually. As capacity expands, the region is forecast to become a net exporter. Carbon black prices are influenced by raw material costs and fluctuating crude oil prices, leading to a 130% price hike from 2003 to 2011. Manufacturers are expected to face margin pressure, prompting consolidation and localized production in individual countries.
