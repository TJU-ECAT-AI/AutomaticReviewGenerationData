The Ceresana Research market study forecasts a dynamic growth for the carbon black market until 2019, expecting a significant increase in market volume by over 3.1 million tonnes compared to 2011 levels. Tyres consume the majority of carbon black, with over 7.8 million tonnes consumed in 2011. Asia Pacific leads the growth, with consumption and production volumes anticipated to increase by more than 4.5% annually. China, in particular, consumes over 30% of the total global carbon black market volume. Production costs and prices are influenced by raw material prices, particularly crude oil, leading to pressure on manufacturers' margins and an expectation for further consolidation and localized production. The report offers in-depth analysis and forecasts for the carbon black market by region, country, and application area, along with profiles of the 52 largest manufacturers.
