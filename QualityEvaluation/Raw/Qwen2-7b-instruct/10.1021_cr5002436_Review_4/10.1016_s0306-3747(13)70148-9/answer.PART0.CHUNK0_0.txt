The global demand for carbon black is projected to experience significant growth until 2019, with an estimated increase of over 3.1 million tonnes compared to 2011 levels. Tyres account for the largest portion of consumption, having consumed more than 7.8 million tonnes in 2011. In addition to being used in the production of tyres, carbon black serves as a pigment in various industrial sectors including plastics, paints, varnishes, and printing inks. The automotive industry stands out as the primary market for carbon black, significantly impacting the tyre segment and the broader rubber product industry. Asia Pacific, particularly China, is expected to lead market growth with consumption and production volumes increasing at a rate exceeding 4.5% annually. China alone consumes more than 30% of the global carbon black market. Manufacturers face margin pressure, leading to forecasts of increased consolidation and localized production in individual countries.
