[1] "The main reaction in catalytic dehydrogenation is the formation of mono-olefins from the corresponding feed paraffin. Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions."
[2] "The consecutive reactions, the dehydrogenation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, are catalyzed on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins."
[3] "The role of catalysts and supports is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions."
[4] "The high dispersion is also necessary to achieve high selectivity to dehydrogenation relative to undesirable side reactions, such as cracking."
[5] "The relationship between selectivity and conversion can be simulated according to Eq. (5), if rate functions, relative rate constants, and equilibrium constants are known."

1. In catalytic dehydrogenation, the main reaction involves transforming paraffins into mono-olefins. Other reactions include consecutive and side reactions.

2. Consecutive reactions, such as the transformation of mono-olefins to diolefins and triolefins, occur on the same active sites as the dehydrogenation of paraffins to mono-olefins.

3. Catalysts play a crucial role in accelerating the main reaction while managing other reactions in dehydrogenation processes.

4. High dispersion of the catalyst is essential for achieving high selectivity towards dehydrogenation, minimizing undesirable side reactions like cracking.

5. The simulation of selectivity and conversion relationships relies on knowing rate functions, relative rate constants, and equilibrium constants.
