[1] "Early work in this area was conducted by Thorsteinson et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst [30,31], and a number of papers and patents based on that work have been issued by Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories [3239]."
[2] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions [38,39]."
