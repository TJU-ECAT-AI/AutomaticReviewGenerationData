[1] "The dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the heat is provided, at least in part, by the sensible heat stored in the catalyst bed during regeneration (carbon burn); additional heat is provided by direct fuel combustion and also by heat released in the chromium redox cycle."
[2] "The actual design reflects a compromise between gas flow distribution across a large cross-sectional area and the need to maintain a low pressure drop."
[3] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated."
[4] "In the Oleflex process, today more than 1 million metric tons propylene and 2 million metric tons isobutylene are produced via this route."
[5] "The heat of reaction for paraffin dehydrogenation is about 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol)."

1. The dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic, requiring heat provided by the sensible heat from the catalyst bed during regeneration, direct fuel combustion, and the chromium redox cycle.
2. The reactor design balances gas flow distribution and pressure drop.
3. Increasing temperature enhances conversion, but also accelerates side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst degradation.
4. The Oleflex process produces over 1 million metric tons of propylene and 2 million metric tons of isobutylene annually.
5. The heat of reaction for dehydrogenating paraffins is approximately 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol).

1. 脱氢反应是吸热的，部分热量由再生过程中催化剂床的显热提供，额外的热量由直接燃料燃烧和铬的氧化还原循环释放。
2. 反应器设计在大面积气体流动分布与保持低压降之间取得平衡。
3. 温度升高增加转化率，同时加速副反应、焦炭形成和催化剂失效。
4. Oleflex工艺每年生产超过100万吨丙烯和200万吨异丁烯。
5. 脱氢化正构烷烃的热量约为30 kcal/mol（125 kJ/mol）。
