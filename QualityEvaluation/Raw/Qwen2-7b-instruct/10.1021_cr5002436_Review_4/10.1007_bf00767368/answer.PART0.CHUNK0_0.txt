1. The conversion of methane to benzene on ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts exhibits high selectivity at 973 K, with HZSM-5 showing 100% selectivity. Incorporating metal ions such as Mo or Zn into the catalysts significantly enhances the conversion rate without affecting the high selectivity for benzene production.

2. Under the experimental conditions tested, HZSM-5 zeolites demonstrated negligible activity for the aromatization process. This highlights the importance of specific catalyst properties in achieving effective conversion.

3. The activation temperature for methane dehydroaromatization over MoHZSM-5 is approximately 50 K lower compared to ZnHZSM-5, indicating a more favorable activation process for Mo-modified catalysts.

4. Ethene and hydrogen gases can be directly identified in the product mix during temperature-programmed aromatization (TPAR) experiments conducted at 973 K over MoHZSM-5. This observation supports the direct pathway of methane conversion to benzene through these intermediates.

5. The yield of benzene increases with the partial pressure of methane, suggesting that increasing the feedstock concentration favors the production of benzene in the conversion process.

1. 在973 K下，ZSM-5沸石催化剂上甲烷到苯的转化表现出高选择性，HZSM-5显示出100%的选择性。通过在催化剂中加入金属离子如Mo或Zn，可以显著提高转化率而不影响苯生产的高选择性。

2. 在给定的实验条件下，HZSM-5沸石未显示出任何芳香化活性。这突出了特定催化剂特性在实现有效转化中的重要性。

3. 甲烷脱氢芳构化在MoHZSM-5上的激活温度约为50 K低于ZnHZSM-5，表明Mo改性催化剂具有更有利于的激活过程。

4. 在973 K下进行的温度程序化的芳构化（TPAR）实验中，可以直接识别出乙烯和氢气作为产品组分。这一观察结果支持通过这些中间体直接将甲烷转化为苯的途径。

5. 随着甲烷部分压力的增加，苯的产率会增加，表明增加原料浓度有利于生产苯的转化过程。
