1. Under non-oxidizing conditions, various carbon-based materials, including modified ZSM-5 catalysts, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the activation of methane through a carbenium ion mechanism. The presence of metals such as Mo or Zn in the ZSM-5 catalyst plays a significant role in this process.

2. The proposed mechanism for the activation of methane involves the formation of a carbenium ion, which then undergoes conversion to form benzene, ethene, and hydrogen under non-oxidizing conditions.

3. Factors influencing the catalytic activity include temperature and the surface chemistry of the catalyst material. The high selectivity to benzene observed under these conditions suggests that the catalysts are highly efficient in the dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane.

4. The high catalytic activity and selectivity of Mo-modified ZSM-5 catalysts for the conversion of methane at 973 K indicate their potential for use in the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The yield of benzene increases with the partial pressure of methane, suggesting that increasing the concentration of reactants can enhance the conversion efficiency of the catalysts.

1. 在非氧化条件下，包括修改后的ZSM-5催化剂在内的各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性，这是通过甲烷的卡宾离子机制激活实现的。ZSM-5催化剂中的钼或锌的存在在这一过程中发挥了重要作用。

2. 催化剂活性的提议机制涉及卡宾离子的形成，然后在非氧化条件下转化为苯、乙烯和氢。

3. 影响催化活性的因素包括温度和催化剂材料的表面化学。在这些条件下观察到的高选择性苯表明，催化剂在甲烷脱氢和芳构化过程中的效率很高。

4. 973 K时，Mo修饰的ZSM-5催化剂的高催化活性和苯选择性表明它们在开发新型高效碳基催化剂方面具有潜力用于烷烃脱氢反应。

5. 随着甲烷分压的增加，苯的产率增加，这表明增加反应物浓度可以提高催化剂的转换效率。
