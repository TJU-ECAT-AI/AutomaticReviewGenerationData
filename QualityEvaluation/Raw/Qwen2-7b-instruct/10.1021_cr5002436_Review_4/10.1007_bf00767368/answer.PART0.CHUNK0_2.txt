The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane under non-oxidizing conditions on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts have been studied. The results show that benzene is the only hydrocarbon product of the catalytic conversion of methane at high temperature (973 K). Incorporating metal cations like Mo or Zn significantly improves the catalytic activity of ZSM-5 without affecting the selectivity to benzene. The activation of methane on these catalysts follows a carbenium ion mechanism. The high selectivity to benzene is attributed to the thermodynamic favorability of dehydro-aromatization over dehydro-dimerization. The presence of Mo or Zn in the zeolite acts as a hydride acceptor, facilitating the activation of methane and promoting the formation of benzene.

在非氧化条件下，对修改后的ZSM-5沸石催化剂上甲烷的脱氢和芳构化进行了研究。结果表明，在高温度（973 K）下，催化转化的唯一烃类产物为苯。通过引入金属离子如Mo或Zn显著提高了ZSM-5的催化活性，而不会影响苯的选择性。这些催化剂上的甲烷激活遵循卡宾离子机制。苯的选择性归因于甲烷脱氢化相对于二聚化的热力学优势。Mo或Zn的存在作为氢化物接受体，促进甲烷的活化和苯的形成。
