Various carbon-based materials, including modified ZSM-5 zeolites with incorporated metals like molybdenum (Mo) or zinc (Zn), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the activation of methane via a carbenium ion mechanism. This process involves the formation of a carbenium ion from methane, which then undergoes dehydro-aromatization to produce benzene. The presence of Mo or Zn in the zeolite catalysts significantly enhances the activity for the conversion of methane, particularly with MoHZSM-5 showing the best performance. These catalysts maintain high selectivity towards benzene production even at high temperatures, where dehydro-aromatization is favored thermodynamically over dehydro-dimerization. The zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to facilitate the formation of transient species in the case of ZnHZSM-5 catalysts. The yield of benzene increases with the partial pressure of methane, indicating the influence of reaction conditions on the efficiency of the catalytic process.

各种碳基材料，包括引入钼（Mo）或锌（Zn）的改性ZSM-5沸石催化剂，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性，由于甲烷通过一种碳正离子机制被激活。这一过程涉及从甲烷形成碳正离子，然后进行脱氢芳构化以产生苯。Mo或Zn在沸石催化剂中的存在显著提高了甲烷转换的活性，特别是MoHZSM-5显示出了最佳性能。这些催化剂即使在高温下也能保持高选择性向苯的生产，而脱氢芳构化从热力学角度来看比脱氢二聚化更为有利。锌离子作为氢化物接受体，促进了ZnHZSM-5催化剂中形成过渡物种的情况。随着甲烷分压的增加，苯的产率提高，表明反应条件对催化过程效率的影响。
