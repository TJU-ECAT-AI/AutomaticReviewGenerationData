[1] "Iron-based catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of iron."
[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane was first conducted over 20FeAl and 20Fe/5SAl catalysts and the results were shown in Fig. 1."
[4] "Compared with 20FeAl, much higher conversion and propylene yield (about 20%) with more than 80% selectivity were obtained over 20Fe/5SAl."
[5] "It was found that the sulfate species mainly existed in the form of SO2 4 and interacted with Fe species via FeOS bond."
[6] "Meanwhile, since the secondary carbon of propane has 0.051 negative charges, they are more likely to be adsorbed on the electron-deficient state of Fe species."
[7] "As for catalyst deactivation, the loss of sulfate ion and the reduction of iron cations were believed to be the main reasons for the irreversible deactivation of 20Fe/5SAl."

The literature discusses the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using iron-based catalysts, specifically focusing on the improvement in performance through sulfation of alumina. The sulfur species are found to interact with iron species via a FeOS bond, enhancing acidity and adsorption capacity, thus boosting the activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. Carbon deposition and the loss of sulfur species are identified as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation.

文献讨论了使用铁基催化剂进行丙烷脱氢反应，特别关注通过氧化铝的硫化来改善性能。发现硫物种通过FeOS键与铁物种相互作用，增强了酸性和吸附能力，从而提升了脱氢性能和选择性。碳沉积和硫物种的损失被认为是催化剂不可逆失活的主要原因。
