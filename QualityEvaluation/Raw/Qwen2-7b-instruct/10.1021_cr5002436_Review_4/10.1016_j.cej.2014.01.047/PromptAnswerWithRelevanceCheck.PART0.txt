The literature discusses iron-based catalysts that are pollution-free, affordable, and widely used in alkane dehydrogenation. Sulfated alumina, specifically, was found to enhance the dehydrogenation performance of iron catalysts due to its weaker acidity which prevents iron sintering. The process of preparing the sulfated alumina involved mixing pseudo boehmite, deionized water, and hydrochloric acid at specific ratios and temperatures to achieve the desired pH. The interaction between sulfate species (mainly in the form of SO2 4) and iron species via a FeOS bond led to enhanced acidity and stronger adsorption capacity for propane. The secondary carbon of propane, having a slight negative charge, was more likely to adsorb on the electron-deficient state of iron species, contributing to the high activity. The main reasons for the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst were identified as the loss of sulfate ions and the reduction of iron cations.

文献讨论了用于烷烃脱氢的铁基催化剂，这些催化剂无污染、成本低廉且易于获取。硫酸化的氧化铝因其较低的酸性而被发现可以有效防止铁的聚集，从而增强铁催化剂的性能。硫酸化铝的制备过程涉及将沸石甲硅烷、去离子水和盐酸按特定比例混合，并在65°C的水浴中放置直至pH值达到34，形成溶液。硫酸根物种（主要以SO2 4的形式存在）与铁物种通过FeOS键相互作用，导致了更强的酸性和丙烷更好的吸附能力。由于丙烷的次级碳带有轻微的负电荷，因此更有可能吸附到铁物种的电子缺陷状态上，从而促进高活性。催化剂不可逆失活的主要原因被认为是硫酸根离子的流失和铁离子的还原。

<p>In comparison, iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation [1219]. Among the studied catalysts, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading were highly active in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation [1517], exhibiting 20-65% propane conversion. Though the stronger acidity of ZSM-5 favored the activation and cleavage of CH, it also brought about much side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, resulting in low selectivity and stability [20,21]. Therefore, many studies were focused on the application of zeolite-based catalysts with a high Si/Al, but the activity was rather low [22].</p>
<p>Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of iron. Michorczyk et al. found that Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 exhibited high selectivity (85%) in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in spite of low conversion (less than 10%) [23]. To our knowledge, little work has been dedicated to improving the dehydrogenation performance of Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>Previous researchers have shown that sulfation of silica has beneficial effects on the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 in ethane dehydrogenation [24]. Herein, in this paper, we evaluated the performance of sulfated alumina supported iron catalyst in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and correlated the contribution of sulfate species to the different behavior. Meanwhile, the reasons for catalyst deactivation were also discussed.</p>

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique surface chemistry and structure. The presence of functional groups such as carboxyl, phenolic, and pyrolic groups enhances the surface acidity and provides additional reactive sites. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of alkane molecules through adsorption onto these active sites, followed by cleavage of the C-C bonds. The surface chemistry, including the type and concentration of functional groups, as well as the morphology of the carbon materials, plays a significant role in determining their catalytic activity. Factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of co-catalysts can also influence the catalytic performance. The implications of this phenomenon are vast, particularly in the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes, which can lead to more sustainable and economically viable methods of producing hydrogen and other valuable chemicals from hydrocarbons. Future research challenges include optimizing the synthesis conditions to tailor the surface properties of carbon materials for specific applications, enhancing the stability and durability of these catalysts, and integrating them into practical industrial processes.

The study explores the use of iron-based catalysts for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The researchers highlight the benefits of iron oxide catalysts, noting their pollution-free nature, cost-effectiveness, and availability. They compare iron/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading to be highly active in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation, but also mention the side reactions and reduced selectivity and stability due to the stronger acidity of ZSM-5. The study contrasts iron catalysts supported on c-Al2O3, which is noted for its weaker acidity, preventing the sintering of iron. The researchers report that sulfated alumina-supported iron catalysts demonstrate excellent dehydrogenation performance, with sulfate species interacting with iron through FeOS bonds, enhancing acidity and adsorption capacity for propane. The loss of sulfate species is identified as the primary cause of catalyst deactivation.
