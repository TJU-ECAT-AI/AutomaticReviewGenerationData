[1] "Iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Among the studied catalysts, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading were highly active in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Though the stronger acidity of ZSM-5 favored the activation and cleavage of CH, it also brought about much side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, resulting in low selectivity and stability."
[4] "Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of iron."
[5] "Sulfated alumina supported iron catalysts showed excellent dehydrogenation performance."
[6] "Sulfate species interacted with Fe via FeOS bonds."
[7] "The interaction leads to enhanced acidity and stronger adsorption capacity of C3H8."
[8] "Loss of sulfate species is the main reason for catalyst deactivation."

The study explores the use of iron-based catalysts for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The researchers highlight the benefits of iron oxide catalysts, noting their pollution-free nature, cost-effectiveness, and availability. They compare iron/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading to be highly active in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation, but also mention the side reactions and reduced selectivity and stability due to the stronger acidity of ZSM-5. The study contrasts iron catalysts supported on c-Al2O3, which is noted for its weaker acidity, preventing the sintering of iron. The researchers report that sulfated alumina-supported iron catalysts demonstrate excellent dehydrogenation performance, with sulfate species interacting with iron through FeOS bonds, enhancing acidity and adsorption capacity for propane. The loss of sulfate species is identified as the primary cause of catalyst deactivation.

研究探讨了铁基催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的应用。研究人员强调了铁氧化物催化剂的无污染、低成本和易得性，并将其广泛应用于烷烃脱氢。他们将具有低铁负载的铁/ZSM-5催化剂与N2O介导的丙烷脱氢反应中的高活性进行比较，但提到ZSM-5的更强酸性导致了裂解和多聚化等副反应，从而降低了选择性和稳定性。研究对比了铁基催化剂在c-Al2O3上的应用，指出其较弱的酸性能够防止铁的聚集。研究人员报告说，含硫化铝支持的铁催化剂显示出出色的脱氢性能，硫酸根物种通过FeOS键与铁相互作用，增强了酸性和丙烷的吸附能力。硫酸根物种的流失被确定为催化剂不可逆失活的主要原因。
