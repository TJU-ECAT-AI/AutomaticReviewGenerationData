[1] "In comparison, iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of iron."
[3] "Sulfated alumina support was prepared as follows: firstly, pseudo boehmite, deionized water and hydrochloric acid with a mass ratio of 10:30:1 were mixed and placed in a water bath at 65 C until the pH value reached 34, meanwhile, the sol formed."
[4] "It was found that the sulfate species mainly existed in the form of SO2 4 and interacted with Fe species via FeOS bond."
[5] "Meanwhile, since the secondary carbon of propane has 0.051 negative charges, they are more likely to be adsorbed on the electron-deficient state of Fe species."

1. Iron oxide catalysts are pollution-free, cost-effective, and readily available materials commonly used in alkane dehydrogenation.
2. C-Al2O3 is considered an excellent support with less acidity compared to ZSM-5, preventing the sintering of iron.
3. Sulfated alumina was prepared by mixing pseudo boehmite, deionized water, and hydrochloric acid in a specific ratio and temperature to adjust the pH.
4. Sulfate species in the form of SO2 4 interact with iron species through a FeOS bond, enhancing acidity and adsorption capacity.
5. Propane's secondary carbon, with a slight negative charge, is more prone to adsorption on electron-deficient iron species, aiding in the dehydrogenation process.

1. 铁氧化物催化剂是一种无污染、成本低廉且易于获取的材料，在烷烃脱氢反应中广泛应用。
2. 相比于ZSM-5，c-Al2O3被认为是一种酸性较弱、能防止铁聚集的优秀支撑材料。
3. 将沸石甲醇与去离子水和盐酸按特定比例混合，并在65°C的水浴中放置，直至pH值达到34，形成溶液。
4. 硫酸根物种主要以SO2 4的形式存在，并通过FeOS键与铁物种相互作用，增强酸性和吸附能力。
5. 烷烃的二级碳带有轻微负电荷，更容易吸附到铁物种的电子缺乏状态上，促进脱氢过程。
