<p>In comparison, iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation [1219]. Among the studied catalysts, Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading were highly active in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation [1517], exhibiting 20-65% propane conversion. Though the stronger acidity of ZSM-5 favored the activation and cleavage of CH, it also brought about much side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, resulting in low selectivity and stability [20,21]. Therefore, many studies were focused on the application of zeolite-based catalysts with a high Si/Al, but the activity was rather low [22].</p>
<p>Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of iron. Michorczyk et al. found that Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 exhibited high selectivity (85%) in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in spite of low conversion (less than 10%) [23]. To our knowledge, little work has been dedicated to improving the dehydrogenation performance of Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>Previous researchers have shown that sulfation of silica has beneficial effects on the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 in ethane dehydrogenation [24]. Herein, in this paper, we evaluated the performance of sulfated alumina supported iron catalyst in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and correlated the contribution of sulfate species to the different behavior. Meanwhile, the reasons for catalyst deactivation were also discussed.</p>

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique surface chemistry and structure. The presence of functional groups such as carboxyl, phenolic, and pyrolic groups enhances the surface acidity and provides additional reactive sites. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of alkane molecules through adsorption onto these active sites, followed by cleavage of the C-C bonds. The surface chemistry, including the type and concentration of functional groups, as well as the morphology of the carbon materials, plays a significant role in determining their catalytic activity. Factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of co-catalysts can also influence the catalytic performance. The implications of this phenomenon are vast, particularly in the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation processes, which can lead to more sustainable and economically viable methods of producing hydrogen and other valuable chemicals from hydrocarbons. Future research challenges include optimizing the synthesis conditions to tailor the surface properties of carbon materials for specific applications, enhancing the stability and durability of these catalysts, and integrating them into practical industrial processes.
