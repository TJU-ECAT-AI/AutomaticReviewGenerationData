[1] "Iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in alkane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Sulfated alumina support was prepared as follows: firstly, pseudo boehmite, deionized water and hydrochloric acid with a mass ratio of 10:30:1 were mixed and placed in a water bath at 65 C until the pH value reached 34, meanwhile, the sol formed."
[4] "The sulfate species mainly existed in the form of SO2 4 and interacted with Fe species via FeOS bond."
[5] "It was found that the sulfate species mainly existed in the form of SO2 4 and interacted with Fe species via FeOS bond."
[6] "Meanwhile, since the secondary carbon of propane has 0.051 negative charges, they are more likely to be adsorbed on the electron-deficient state of Fe species."
[7] "As for catalyst deactivation, the loss of sulfate ion and the reduction of iron cations were believed to be the main reasons for the irreversible deactivation of 20Fe/5SAl."

The literature discusses iron-based catalysts that are pollution-free, affordable, and widely used in alkane dehydrogenation. Sulfated alumina, specifically, was found to enhance the dehydrogenation performance of iron catalysts due to its weaker acidity which prevents iron sintering. The process of preparing the sulfated alumina involved mixing pseudo boehmite, deionized water, and hydrochloric acid at specific ratios and temperatures to achieve the desired pH. The interaction between sulfate species (mainly in the form of SO2 4) and iron species via a FeOS bond led to enhanced acidity and stronger adsorption capacity for propane. The secondary carbon of propane, having a slight negative charge, was more likely to adsorb on the electron-deficient state of iron species, contributing to the high activity. The main reasons for the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst were identified as the loss of sulfate ions and the reduction of iron cations.

文献讨论了用于烷烃脱氢的铁基催化剂，这些催化剂无污染、成本低廉且易于获取。硫酸化的氧化铝因其较低的酸性而被发现可以有效防止铁的聚集，从而增强铁催化剂的性能。硫酸化铝的制备过程涉及将沸石甲硅烷、去离子水和盐酸按特定比例混合，并在65°C的水浴中放置直至pH值达到34，形成溶液。硫酸根物种（主要以SO2 4的形式存在）与铁物种通过FeOS键相互作用，导致了更强的酸性和丙烷更好的吸附能力。由于丙烷的次级碳带有轻微的负电荷，因此更有可能吸附到铁物种的电子缺陷状态上，从而促进高活性。催化剂不可逆失活的主要原因被认为是硫酸根离子的流失和铁离子的还原。
