[1] "Since iron containing oxides are known to be favorable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions (e.g., 4, 5), the development of a suitable preparation procedure for the present active phase-support combination is of interest."
[2] "The presently operated dehydrogenation processes use a fixed catalyst bed, which calls for mechanically strong catalyst bodies of at least some millimeters in diameter. In order to avoid shaping operations, the use of preshaped zirconia support bodies is required."
[3] "Although chelating agents have proved to be useful iron precursor compounds, the employment of a simple salt might be profitable if this also would produce a well-distributed iron phase on the zirconia support."
[4] "The use of two different hydrogen partial pressures, viz., 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, resulted only in trivial differences in the obtained reduction profiles (Fig. 5)."
[5] "The addition of potassium carbonate shifts the onset temperatures of the initial reduction to temperatures about 100C higher than in catalysts without potassium."

1. Iron oxides are recognized as advantageous catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. The creation of an appropriate preparation process for the active phase-support pairing is essential. The current dehydrogenation methods employ fixed catalyst beds necessitating robust catalyst bodies measuring several millimeters in diameter. To sidestep shaping tasks, the utilization of preshaped zirconia support bodies is advisable. Chelating agents have been demonstrated as effective iron precursor substances. However, the introduction of a straightforward salt might prove beneficial if it also yields a uniformly distributed iron phase on the zirconia support. The application of two varying hydrogen partial pressures, specifically 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, led to insignificant variations in the acquired reduction profiles. The inclusion of potassium carbonate elevates the starting temperatures of the initial reduction processes by approximately 100C compared to catalysts devoid of potassium.

1. 铁氧化物被确认为有利的脱氢反应催化剂。对于活性成分-支撑组合，开发合适的制备程序是必要的。当前的脱氢过程使用固定的催化剂床，需要至少几毫米直径的坚固催化剂体。为了避免成型操作，采用成型的氧化锆支撑体是必要的。已经证明螯合剂是有效的铁前体化合物。然而，使用简单的盐可能是有益的，如果它也能在氧化锆支持上产生均匀分布的铁相。将两种不同的氢分压，即10%和70%H2（体积分数）在Ar中应用，仅导致轻微的不同在获得的还原轮廓（图5）。向催化剂中添加碳酸钾使初始还原过程的起始温度升高约100C，与不含钾的催化剂相比。
