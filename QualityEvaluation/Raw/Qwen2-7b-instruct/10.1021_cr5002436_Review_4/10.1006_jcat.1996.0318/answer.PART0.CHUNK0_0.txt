1. Supported iron oxide catalysts are effective for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene, due to their ability to overcome issues associated with bulk catalysts. Zirconia is a suitable support material for these catalysts, enabling microscopic dispersion of the iron oxide phase (as seen through TEM and XRD) and homogeneous distribution across the support body.

2. The study found minimal differences in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles when using different hydrogen partial pressures (10% and 70% in Ar).

3. Comparing catalysts prepared using ammonium iron (III) citrate and ammonium iron (III) EDTA on Daiichi (II) zirconia, the EDTA-prepared catalysts showed a less resolved TPR profile, even at lower iron loadings.

4. The strong diffraction pattern of zirconia can mask diffraction peaks from the deposited active phases.

5. Addition of potassium carbonate shifts the onset temperatures of the initial reduction to higher temperatures than in catalysts without potassium. This effect might be attributed to the presence of potassium ferrite, limited accessibility of the iron compound due to potassium carbonate coverage, or the impact of the potassium compound on the catalyst's pore structure.

1. 使用支持的铁氧化物催化剂对于脱氢化烃类，如乙苯，可以提供成功的方法来克服工业应用的大规模催化剂遇到的问题。锆酸盐是为这些催化剂准备支持催化剂的理想材料，它能够使铁氧化物相微观分散（通过TEM和XRD）并在支撑体上实现均匀分布。

2. 研究发现，在使用不同氢分压（10%和70%在Ar中）时，仅得到微小的温度程序还原（TPR）谱图差异。

3. 将柠檬酸盐和EDTA分别用于制备Daiichi（II）锆酸盐上的催化剂进行比较，使用EDTA制备的催化剂显示出更不清晰的TPR谱图，即使在较低的铁负载下也是如此。

4. 锆酸盐的强烈衍射模式可以掩盖沉积活性相的衍射峰。

5. 向催化剂中添加碳酸钾将初始还原的起始温度提升到比无钾催化剂更高的温度。这种效应可能归因于钾铁氧体的存在、铁化合物的可访问性受限于碳酸钾覆盖，或者钾化合物对催化剂孔结构的影响。
