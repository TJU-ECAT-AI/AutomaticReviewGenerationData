[1] "Few examples of the iron-on-zirconia (powder) catalyst system are encountered in literature. This is due to the fact that zirconia has only recently been used and studied more often as a catalyst support material."
[2] "When zirconiais used as a support in investigations on iron containing catalysts, it is usually incorporated into a series of various support materials."
[3] "Although chelating agents have proved to be useful iron precursor compounds, the employment of a simple salt might be profitable if this also would produce a well-distributed iron phase on the zirconia support."
[4] "The use of two different hydrogen partial pressures, viz., 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, resulted only in trivial differences in the obtained reduction profiles."
[5] "It was also found that the presence of potassium increases the onset of reduction of the iron phase by about 100C."

The literature discusses the use of zirconia as a catalyst support for iron-based catalysts, noting that it is a less common practice compared to using it in combination with other support materials. Chelating agents are mentioned as effective for distributing iron on the zirconia support, while simple salts may also produce a well-distributed iron phase. The literature further explains that the use of two hydrogen partial pressures in reduction experiments led to minor differences in the profiles. Additionally, the introduction of potassium into the catalyst system raises the onset temperature of iron reduction by approximately 100 degrees Celsius.

文献讨论了将锆石用作铁基催化剂载体的使用情况，指出与与其他支持材料结合相比，这更少被采用。报道中提到螯合剂是有效在锆石支持上分布铁的手段，而简单的盐也可能产生均匀分布的铁相。文献进一步解释，在降低氢分压的实验中，获得的还原图谱仅表现出微小差异。此外，向催化剂系统引入钾会将铁还原的起始温度提高约100摄氏度。
