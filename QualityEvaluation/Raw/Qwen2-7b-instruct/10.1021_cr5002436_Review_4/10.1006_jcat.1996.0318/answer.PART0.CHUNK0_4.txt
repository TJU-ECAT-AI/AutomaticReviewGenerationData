[4] "The employment of a simple salt might be profitable if this also would produce a well-distributed iron phase on the zirconia support."
[5] "It was found that zirconia has a stabilizing influence on iron (II) species: spreading of these species caused a decreased reducibility of iron (III) via iron (II) to metallic iron."

1. The current combination of the active phase and support is considered interesting for investigation.
2. Successful methods of impregnating preshaped support bodies with chelating compounds like metal EDTA, metal citrate, and metal formate are documented in existing literature.
3. The most recent study involving zirconia-supported iron catalysts by Guglielminotti (9) did not focus specifically on the catalyst preparation process (wet impregnation with iron nitrate of a precipitated zirconia).
4. Employing a simple salt might prove beneficial for creating a well-distributed iron phase on the zirconia support.
5. Zirconia was found to stabilize iron (II) species, leading to a reduced reducibility of iron (III) through iron (II) to metallic iron.
6. Transmission electron microscopy was conducted on calcined Daiichi (batch I) zirconia-supported iron oxide catalysts.
7. To examine the character of this decoration, element analysis utilizing a field emission gun with a highly focused and bright electron beam was executed.
8. Gas emissions of ammonia and carbon dioxide were observed during the preparation of the impregnating solution, suggesting a substitution reaction is occurring.
9. Using two different hydrogen partial pressures, 10% and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, resulted in minimal variations in the acquired reduction profiles.
