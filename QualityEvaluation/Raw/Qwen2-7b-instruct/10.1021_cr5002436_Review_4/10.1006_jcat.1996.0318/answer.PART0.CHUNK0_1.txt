[1] "Procedures developed earlier for preparing supported iron catalysts by incipient wetness impregnation of pre-shaped support bodies can also be applied to zirconia supports."
[2] "It was found that the application of two different hydrogen partial pressures, viz., 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, resulted only in trivial differences in the obtained reduction profiles."
[3] "It was also found that potassium raises the temperature of the onset of reduction of the iron phase by about 100C."
[4] "By element analysis and HR-TEM, it was unambiguously demonstrated that a coverage of the zirconia support with very small iron oxide species had been accomplished."

The literature discusses the preparation and characterization of iron-based dehydrogenation catalysts supported on zirconia. Various procedures for impregnating zirconia support bodies with iron oxide precursors are explored, focusing on ammonium iron (III) citrate and ammonium iron (III) EDTA as complex salts that facilitate a homogeneous distribution of the iron-containing phase. The text also delves into the characterization techniques used, including electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, and thermomagnetic analysis. It is highlighted that at loadings higher than 3 wt% Fe, the catalysts display a bi-modal particle size distribution, suggesting bulk-like properties in TPR above this threshold. Potassium addition is noted to increase the onset temperature of iron reduction by approximately 100°C. The text emphasizes the importance of these findings for understanding the interaction between iron oxide phases and the zirconia support, which impacts catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

文献讨论了在锆酸盐支持体上制备铁基脱氢催化剂的方法及其表征。探索了使用各种方法浸渍锆酸盐支撑体中的铁氧化物前体，重点是使用铵铁（III）柠檬酸盐和铵铁（III）EDTA作为复合盐，以实现铁含相成分在支撑体表面的均匀分布。文中还涉及了用于表征的技术，包括电子显微镜、X射线衍射、温度程序化还原和热磁分析。强调了负载量高于3 wt% Fe时催化剂表现出双模态颗粒尺寸分布，这在TPR中表明具有块状特性。钾的添加被发现可以提高铁还原的起始温度约100°C。这些发现对于理解铁氧化物相与锆酸盐支持体之间的相互作用至关重要，这直接影响脱氢反应的催化活性。
