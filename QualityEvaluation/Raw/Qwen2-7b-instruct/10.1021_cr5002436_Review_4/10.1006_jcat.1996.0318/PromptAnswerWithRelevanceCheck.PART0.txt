<p>The use of a supported iron oxide catalyst can provide a successful remedy for overcoming the problems encountered with the industrially applied bulk catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene (1, 2).</p>
<p>Zirconia is a suitable support for preparing a supported dehydrogenation catalyst: it disperses the iron oxide phase microscopically (TEM, XRD), it does not form bulk mixed compounds with iron or potassium (XRD), and the homogeneous application of the catalytically active phases throughout the catalyst support body is feasible.</p>
<p>It was found that the application of two different hydrogen partial pressures, viz., 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, resulted only in trivial differences in the obtained reduction profiles (Fig. 5).</p>
<p>When comparing the catalysts ex EDTA and citrate supported on Daiichi (II) zirconia (Fig. 9), it is observed that in the case of EDTA a less resolved TPR profile is obtained. With the catalysts ex citrate of a lower loading (e.g., 1 wt% Fe) this was also observed.</p>
<p>The intense diffraction pattern of zirconia can obscure diffraction peaks originating from deposited active phases.</p>

1. Supported iron oxide catalysts are effective for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene, due to their ability to overcome issues associated with bulk catalysts. Zirconia is a suitable support material for these catalysts, enabling microscopic dispersion of the iron oxide phase (as seen through TEM and XRD) and homogeneous distribution across the support body.

2. The study found minimal differences in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles when using different hydrogen partial pressures (10% and 70% in Ar).

3. Comparing catalysts prepared using ammonium iron (III) citrate and ammonium iron (III) EDTA on Daiichi (II) zirconia, the EDTA-prepared catalysts showed a less resolved TPR profile, even at lower iron loadings.

4. The strong diffraction pattern of zirconia can mask diffraction peaks from the deposited active phases.

5. Addition of potassium carbonate shifts the onset temperatures of the initial reduction to higher temperatures than in catalysts without potassium. This effect might be attributed to the presence of potassium ferrite, limited accessibility of the iron compound due to potassium carbonate coverage, or the impact of the potassium compound on the catalyst's pore structure.

1. 使用支持的铁氧化物催化剂对于脱氢化烃类，如乙苯，可以提供成功的方法来克服工业应用的大规模催化剂遇到的问题。锆酸盐是为这些催化剂准备支持催化剂的理想材料，它能够使铁氧化物相微观分散（通过TEM和XRD）并在支撑体上实现均匀分布。

2. 研究发现，在使用不同氢分压（10%和70%在Ar中）时，仅得到微小的温度程序还原（TPR）谱图差异。

3. 将柠檬酸盐和EDTA分别用于制备Daiichi（II）锆酸盐上的催化剂进行比较，使用EDTA制备的催化剂显示出更不清晰的TPR谱图，即使在较低的铁负载下也是如此。

4. 锆酸盐的强烈衍射模式可以掩盖沉积活性相的衍射峰。

5. 向催化剂中添加碳酸钾将初始还原的起始温度提升到比无钾催化剂更高的温度。这种效应可能归因于钾铁氧体的存在、铁化合物的可访问性受限于碳酸钾覆盖，或者钾化合物对催化剂孔结构的影响。

[3] "It was also found that potassium raises the temperature of the onset of reduction of the iron phase by about 100C."

The literature discusses the preparation and characterization of iron-based dehydrogenation catalysts supported on zirconia. Various procedures for impregnating zirconia support bodies with iron oxide precursors are explored, focusing on ammonium iron (III) citrate and ammonium iron (III) EDTA as complex salts that facilitate a homogeneous distribution of the iron-containing phase. The text also delves into the characterization techniques used, including electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, and thermomagnetic analysis. It is highlighted that at loadings higher than 3 wt% Fe, the catalysts display a bi-modal particle size distribution, suggesting bulk-like properties in TPR above this threshold. Potassium addition is noted to increase the onset temperature of iron reduction by approximately 100°C. The text emphasizes the importance of these findings for understanding the interaction between iron oxide phases and the zirconia support, which impacts catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

[1] "Few examples of the iron-on-zirconia (powder) catalyst system are encountered in literature. This is due to the fact that zirconia has only recently been used and studied more often as a catalyst support material."
[2] "When zirconiais used as a support in investigations on iron containing catalysts, it is usually incorporated into a series of various support materials."
[3] "Although chelating agents have proved to be useful iron precursor compounds, the employment of a simple salt might be profitable if this also would produce a well-distributed iron phase on the zirconia support."
[4] "The use of two different hydrogen partial pressures, viz., 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, resulted only in trivial differences in the obtained reduction profiles."

The literature discusses the use of zirconia as a catalyst support for iron-based catalysts, noting that it is a less common practice compared to using it in combination with other support materials. Chelating agents are mentioned as effective for distributing iron on the zirconia support, while simple salts may also produce a well-distributed iron phase. The literature further explains that the use of two hydrogen partial pressures in reduction experiments led to minor differences in the profiles. Additionally, the introduction of potassium into the catalyst system raises the onset temperature of iron reduction by approximately 100 degrees Celsius.

文献讨论了将锆石用作铁基催化剂载体的使用情况，指出与与其他支持材料结合相比，这更少被采用。报道中提到螯合剂是有效在锆石支持上分布铁的手段，而简单的盐也可能产生均匀分布的铁相。文献进一步解释，在降低氢分压的实验中，获得的还原图谱仅表现出微小差异。此外，向催化剂系统引入钾会将铁还原的起始温度提高约100摄氏度。

[1] "Since iron containing oxides are known to be favorable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions (e.g., 4, 5), the development of a suitable preparation procedure for the present active phase-support combination is of interest."
[2] "The presently operated dehydrogenation processes use a fixed catalyst bed, which calls for mechanically strong catalyst bodies of at least some millimeters in diameter. In order to avoid shaping operations, the use of preshaped zirconia support bodies is required."
[3] "Although chelating agents have proved to be useful iron precursor compounds, the employment of a simple salt might be profitable if this also would produce a well-distributed iron phase on the zirconia support."

1. Iron oxides are recognized as advantageous catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. The creation of an appropriate preparation process for the active phase-support pairing is essential. The current dehydrogenation methods employ fixed catalyst beds necessitating robust catalyst bodies measuring several millimeters in diameter. To sidestep shaping tasks, the utilization of preshaped zirconia support bodies is advisable. Chelating agents have been demonstrated as effective iron precursor substances. However, the introduction of a straightforward salt might prove beneficial if it also yields a uniformly distributed iron phase on the zirconia support. The application of two varying hydrogen partial pressures, specifically 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, led to insignificant variations in the acquired reduction profiles. The inclusion of potassium carbonate elevates the starting temperatures of the initial reduction processes by approximately 100C compared to catalysts devoid of potassium.

1. 铁氧化物被确认为有利的脱氢反应催化剂。对于活性成分-支撑组合，开发合适的制备程序是必要的。当前的脱氢过程使用固定的催化剂床，需要至少几毫米直径的坚固催化剂体。为了避免成型操作，采用成型的氧化锆支撑体是必要的。已经证明螯合剂是有效的铁前体化合物。然而，使用简单的盐可能是有益的，如果它也能在氧化锆支持上产生均匀分布的铁相。将两种不同的氢分压，即10%和70%H2（体积分数）在Ar中应用，仅导致轻微的不同在获得的还原轮廓（图5）。向催化剂中添加碳酸钾使初始还原过程的起始温度升高约100C，与不含钾的催化剂相比。
