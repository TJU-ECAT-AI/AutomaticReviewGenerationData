[1] "Recent studies showed an association between a functional polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction."
[2] "We hypothesized that this polymorphism was associated with methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in methamphetamine-abuse patients."
[3] "The polymorphism was genotyped in 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls."
[4] "The association of the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene and impulsivity in 138 methamphetamine abusers were assessed using Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11) Chinese version."
[5] "Within the methamphetamine-abuse group, subjects carried the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores of BIS compared to those with the Val/Val genotype."
[6] "The Met allele was also associated with earlier age onset of methamphetamine use."

The study investigated the association between a polymorphism in the BDNF gene, specifically the Val66Met variant, and impulsivity in methamphetamine abusers. It aimed to determine if this genetic variation is linked to methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity. The researchers genotyped 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. They further assessed the association of this polymorphism with impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11) among 138 methamphetamine abusers. The findings indicated that individuals carrying the Met allele showed significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores compared to those with the Val/Val genotype. Moreover, the Met allele was also associated with an earlier age of onset for methamphetamine use.

这项研究探讨了BDNF基因中特定的Val66Met多态性与甲基苯丙胺滥用者冲动性的关联。其目的是确定这种遗传变异是否与甲基苯丙胺滥用和冲动性有关。研究人员对200名甲基苯丙胺滥用患者和219名健康对照进行了BDNF Val66Met多态性的基因分型。他们进一步通过使用Barratt冲动量表11（BIS-11）评估了138名甲基苯丙胺滥用者这一多态性与冲动性的关联。研究结果表明，携带Met等位基因的人在注意力冲动性得分上显著高于携带Val/Val基因型的人。此外，携带Met等位基因还与甲基苯丙胺使用开始的更早年龄相关联。
