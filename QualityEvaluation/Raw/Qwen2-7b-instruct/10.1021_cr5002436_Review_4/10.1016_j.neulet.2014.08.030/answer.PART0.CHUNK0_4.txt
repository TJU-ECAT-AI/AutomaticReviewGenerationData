[1] "Recent studies showed an association between a functional polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction."
[2] "We hypothesized that this polymorphism was associated with methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in methamphetamine-abuse patients."
[3] "The polymorphism was genotyped in 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls."
[4] "Within the methamphetamine-abuse group, subjects carried the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores of BIS compared to those with the Val/Val genotype."
[5] "The Met allele was also associated with earlier age onset of methamphetamine use."

There is no direct evidence linking various carbon-based materials such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons to alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The document discusses the association between a specific genetic polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) and methamphetamine abuse, impulsivity, and age of onset. It does not provide insights into the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation.

文档没有直接证据将各种碳基材料，如焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳与烷烃脱氢反应联系起来。它讨论了特定基因多态性（BDNF Val66Met）与甲基苯丙胺滥用、冲动性和首次使用年龄之间的关联，并未提供有关碳基材料在烷烃脱氢中的催化活性的信息。
