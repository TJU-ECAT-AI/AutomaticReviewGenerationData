[1] "Recent studies showed an association between a functional polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction."
[2] "We hypothesized that this polymorphism was associated with methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in methamphetamine-abuse patients."
[3] "The polymorphism was genotyped in 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls."
[4] "The association of the Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene and impulsivity in 138 methamphetamine abusers were assessed using Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11) Chinese version."
[5] "Within the methamphetamine-abuse group, subjects carried the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores of BIS compared to those with the Val/Val genotype."
[6] "The Met allele was also associated with earlier age onset of methamphetamine use."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There is no direct association found between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and methamphetamine abuse. However, Val/Val carriers of the BDNF gene polymorphism have lower attentional impulsivity scores compared to those carrying the Met allele. This polymorphism may contribute to the age of onset for methamphetamine use.

没有直接发现BDNF Val66Met多态性与甲基安非他命滥用之间的关联。然而，携带BDNF基因多态性的Val/Val型个体具有较低的注意力冲动性评分，与携带Met等位基因的个体相比。这种多态性可能对甲基安非他命使用年龄产生影响。
