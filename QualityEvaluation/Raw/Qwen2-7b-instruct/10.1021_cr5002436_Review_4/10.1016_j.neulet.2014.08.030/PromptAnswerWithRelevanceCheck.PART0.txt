How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?

[1] "Recent studies showed an association between a functional polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction."
[2] "We hypothesized that this polymorphism was associated with methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in methamphetamine-abuse patients."
[3] "The polymorphism was genotyped in 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls."
[4] "Within the methamphetamine-abuse group, subjects carried the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores of BIS compared to those with the Val/Val genotype."
[5] "The Met allele was also associated with earlier age onset of methamphetamine use."
</quotes>

There is an association between a specific polymorphism in the BDNF gene, known as the Val66Met polymorphism, and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction. This polymorphism is also linked to methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in individuals who abuse methamphetamine. A study conducted on 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients revealed that those carrying the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores compared to those with the Val/Val genotype. Additionally, the Met allele was found to be associated with an earlier age of onset for methamphetamine use.

BDNF基因中的特定多态性，称为Val66Met多态性，与甲基安非他命成瘾的易感性有关。这种多态性也与甲基安非他命滥用和滥用者中的冲动性有关。一项针对200名甲基安非他命滥用患者的调查显示，携带Met等位基因的人的注意力冲动性评分比具有Val/Val型的人显著更高。此外，Met等位基因与首次使用甲基安非他命的年龄较早有关。

The study investigated the association between a polymorphism in the BDNF gene, specifically the Val66Met variant, and impulsivity in methamphetamine abusers. It aimed to determine if this genetic variation is linked to methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity. The researchers genotyped 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. They further assessed the association of this polymorphism with impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11) among 138 methamphetamine abusers. The findings indicated that individuals carrying the Met allele showed significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores compared to those with the Val/Val genotype. Moreover, the Met allele was also associated with an earlier age of onset for methamphetamine use.

这项研究探讨了BDNF基因中特定的Val66Met多态性与甲基苯丙胺滥用者冲动性的关联。其目的是确定这种遗传变异是否与甲基苯丙胺滥用和冲动性有关。研究人员对200名甲基苯丙胺滥用患者和219名健康对照进行了BDNF Val66Met多态性的基因分型。他们进一步通过使用Barratt冲动量表11（BIS-11）评估了138名甲基苯丙胺滥用者这一多态性与冲动性的关联。研究结果表明，携带Met等位基因的人在注意力冲动性得分上显著高于携带Val/Val基因型的人。此外，携带Met等位基因还与甲基苯丙胺使用开始的更早年龄相关联。

There is no direct association found between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and methamphetamine abuse. However, Val/Val carriers of the BDNF gene polymorphism have lower attentional impulsivity scores compared to those carrying the Met allele. This polymorphism may contribute to the age of onset for methamphetamine use.

没有直接发现BDNF Val66Met多态性与甲基安非他命滥用之间的关联。然而，携带BDNF基因多态性的Val/Val型个体具有较低的注意力冲动性评分，与携带Met等位基因的个体相比。这种多态性可能对甲基安非他命使用年龄产生影响。

There is no direct evidence linking various carbon-based materials such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons to alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The document discusses the association between a specific genetic polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) and methamphetamine abuse, impulsivity, and age of onset. It does not provide insights into the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation.
