[1] "Recent studies showed an association between a functional polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction."
[2] "We hypothesized that this polymorphism was associated with methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in methamphetamine-abuse patients."
[3] "The polymorphism was genotyped in 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls."
[4] "Within the methamphetamine-abuse group, subjects carried the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores of BIS compared to those with the Val/Val genotype."
[5] "The Met allele was also associated with earlier age onset of methamphetamine use."

The study investigated the association between a genetic polymorphism in the BDNF gene, specifically the Val66Met variant, and its impact on methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity. It involved genotyping 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls. The research found that among methamphetamine abusers, individuals carrying the Met allele demonstrated higher attentional impulsivity scores compared to those with the Val/Val genotype. Furthermore, the Met allele was linked to an earlier age of onset for methamphetamine use.

这项研究探讨了BDNF基因中功能性多态性（Val66Met变异）与甲基苯丙胺滥用和冲动性的关联。它对200例甲基苯丙胺滥用患者和219名健康对照进行了基因分型。研究发现，在甲基苯丙胺滥用者中，携带Met等位基因的人在注意力冲动性量表（BIS）得分上显著高于携带Val/Val基因型的人。此外，Met等位基因还与甲基苯丙胺使用年龄较早有关联。
