[1] "Recent studies showed an association between a functional polymorphism of BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction."
[2] "We hypothesized that this polymorphism was associated with methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in methamphetamine-abuse patients."
[3] "The polymorphism was genotyped in 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients and 219 healthy controls."
[4] "Within the methamphetamine-abuse group, subjects carried the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores of BIS compared to those with the Val/Val genotype."
[5] "The Met allele was also associated with earlier age onset of methamphetamine use."

There is an association between a specific polymorphism in the BDNF gene, known as the Val66Met polymorphism, and the susceptibility to methamphetamine addiction. This polymorphism is also linked to methamphetamine abuse and impulsivity in individuals who abuse methamphetamine. A study conducted on 200 methamphetamine-abuse patients revealed that those carrying the Met allele had significantly higher attentional impulsivity scores compared to those with the Val/Val genotype. Additionally, the Met allele was found to be associated with an earlier age of onset for methamphetamine use.

BDNF基因中的特定多态性，称为Val66Met多态性，与甲基安非他命成瘾的易感性有关。这种多态性也与甲基安非他命滥用和滥用者中的冲动性有关。一项针对200名甲基安非他命滥用患者的调查显示，携带Met等位基因的人的注意力冲动性评分比具有Val/Val型的人显著更高。此外，Met等位基因与首次使用甲基安非他命的年龄较早有关。
