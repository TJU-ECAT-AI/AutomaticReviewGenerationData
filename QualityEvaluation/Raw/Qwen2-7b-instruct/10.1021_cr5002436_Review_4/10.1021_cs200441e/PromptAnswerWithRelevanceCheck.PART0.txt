Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the presence of Zn clusters. These clusters form Zn-based intermediates that facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Temperature and surface chemistry significantly influence the efficiency of these catalytic activities. This discovery holds great promise for developing novel and highly effective carbon-based catalysts.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions of carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, is attributed to the presence of clustered cationic Zn complexes on the surface of modified ZSM-5 zeolites. These complexes significantly influence the surface chemistry and reactivity of the materials. The catalytic performance is affected by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. This discovery holds great promise for the development of more efficient carbon-based catalysts.
