The unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions of carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, is attributed to the presence of clustered cationic Zn complexes on the surface of modified ZSM-5 zeolites. These complexes significantly influence the surface chemistry and reactivity of the materials. The catalytic performance is affected by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. This discovery holds great promise for the development of more efficient carbon-based catalysts.
