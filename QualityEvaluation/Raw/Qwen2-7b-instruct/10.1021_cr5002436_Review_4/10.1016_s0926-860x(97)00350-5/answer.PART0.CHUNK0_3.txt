[1] "An addition of 0.10.3 mmol of iron supported on one gram of activated carbon resulted in significant increase in the catalytic activity."
[2] "X-ray diffraction analyses of activated carbon supported iron catalysts indicated that iron on the surface of the carbon support was converted into magnetite under pretreatment with a carbon dioxide at 973 K."
[3] "Since the magnetite phase disappeared in the reaction of isobutane in an argon atmosphere, magnetite is considered to be an active phase of the catalyst."
[4] "In the dehydrogenation of isobutane in carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide and water were formed. These results indicate that isobutene is produced with both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, through the redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe."
[5] "The catalyst deactivation during the dehydrogenation was attributed to carbon deposition because the surface area of the catalyst decreased after the reaction and the weight of the catalyst bed increased after the reaction."

This literature discusses the successful dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts. The key findings include:
1. The addition of 0.1 to 0.3 mmol of iron per gram of activated carbon significantly increased the catalytic activity.
2. Under pretreatment with carbon dioxide at 973 K, iron on the surface of the carbon support was converted into magnetite.
3. Magnetite is considered an active phase of the catalyst, as its disappearance during the reaction of isobutane in argon suggests its role in the catalytic process.
4. Both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane contribute to the production of isobutene, facilitated by the redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe.
5. The catalyst deactivation during the dehydrogenation was attributed to carbon deposition, evidenced by a decrease in the surface area and an increase in the weight of the catalyst bed post-reaction.

这篇文献讨论了铁负载活性炭催化剂在二氧化碳气氛下成功将异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯。主要发现包括：
1. 每克活性炭添加0.1到0.3毫摩尔的铁显著提高了催化活性。
2. 在973 K下用二氧化碳预处理，碳支持上的铁转化为磁铁矿。
3. 磁铁矿被认为是催化剂的活性成分，因为其在异丁烷在氩气气氛下的反应中消失表明了其在催化过程中的作用。
4. 异丁烷的简单脱氢和氧化脱氢均促进了异丁烯的生成，这一过程通过Fe3O4和Fe的还原循环得以实现。
5. 催化剂在脱氢过程中的失活归因于碳沉积，这从反应后催化剂表面积的减少和催化剂床重量的增加可以得到证实。
