[1] "Effects of reaction conditions on the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity to isobutene will be discussed."
[2] "A 200600 mg portion of catalyst was placed in the center of the reactor by using a quartz glass wool plug."
[3] "At the efuent from the reactor, water was collected into a trap containing butanol."
[4] "Dehydrogenation activity of activated carbon or vanadium, nickel, and copper-loaded activated carbon was reported by Fujimoto in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane."
[5] "With increasing the reaction temperature, isobutane conversion increased monotonously, and isobutene yield increased from 5.7% at 773 K to 30.6% at 923 K."
[6] "Such decreases in the surface area could be attributed to the carbon deposition to the catalyst as reported previously."
[7] "This result indicates that isobutene is produced with both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, through the redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe."
[8] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses how various carbon-based materials, including iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Key findings include:

1. Iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts show high isobutene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide. Loading 0.1-0.3 mmol of iron onto one gram of activated carbon significantly increases catalytic activity.
   
2. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that iron on the surface of the carbon support converts into magnetite under pretreatment with carbon dioxide at 973 K. Magnetite is considered the active phase of the catalyst.

3. The dehydrogenation of isobutane in carbon dioxide produces carbon monoxide and water, indicating both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways through a redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe.

4. Carbon deposition on the catalyst during dehydrogenation leads to a decrease in surface area and an increase in weight, contributing to catalyst deactivation.

These findings suggest that carbon-based materials, especially those with iron loading, can be developed as efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially offering new avenues for the production of valuable olefins.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts. It explains how the addition of iron to the catalyst increases the conversion of isobutane and the yield of isobutene. The maximum conversion reached 23.3% with an iron loading of 0.3 mmol/g of carbon. Higher temperatures also lead to an increase in isobutane conversion and isobutene yield. The addition of lithium to the catalyst helps maintain its activity over prolonged use. Magnetite is formed on the carbon surface during treatment with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide keeps the magnetite phase active, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. The document also notes that carbon deposition on the catalyst during the reaction reduces its surface area.
