[1] "An addition of 0.10.3 mmol of iron supported on one gram of activated carbon resulted in significant increase in the catalytic activity."
[2] "Effects of reaction temperatures on the dehydrogenation of isobutane with Fe(0.3)/AC catalyst were examined. Isobutane conversion, isobutene yield and selectivity as a function of reaction temperature are shown in Fig. 2."
[3] "Isobutene selectivity in a carbon dioxide atmosphere was the same as that in an argon atmosphere. The isobutane conversion and the isobutene yield under carbon dioxide were, however, higher than those in an argon atmosphere."
[4] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K)."
[5] "Since the magnetite phase disappeared in the reaction of isobutane in an argon atmosphere, magnetite is considered to be an active phase of the catalyst."
[6] "In the dehydrogenation of isobutane in carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water were formed. These results indicate that isobutene is produced with both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, through the redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Adding 0.1 to 0.3 mmol of iron supported on one gram of activated carbon significantly increased the catalytic activity.
2. The effect of reaction temperatures on the dehydrogenation of isobutane was examined using a Fe(0.3)/AC catalyst. 
3. The isobutane conversion and isobutene yield were higher under carbon dioxide than under argon.
4. Less carbon was deposited on the catalyst under carbon dioxide compared to argon.
5. Magnetite is considered an active phase of the catalyst since it disappears in the reaction of isobutane in an argon atmosphere.
6. Isobutene is produced through both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, facilitated by the redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe in a carbon dioxide atmosphere.
