The dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was successfully achieved using an iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst at 873 K. With 0.3 mmol of iron loaded onto 1 g of activated carbon, an isobutane conversion of 48%, an isobutene yield of 40%, and a selectivity of 80% were obtained. The process is important due to the growing demand for alkenes. The study discusses the effects of various reaction conditions on the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity towards isobutene.
