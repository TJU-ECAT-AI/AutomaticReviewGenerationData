[1] "Isobutane conversion was 14.3% with an activated carbon without iron loading and it increased with the loading level of iron and reached a maximum of 23.3% in the loading level of iron 0.3 mmol/g of carbon (3.5 wt.% as Fe3O4)."
[2] "With increasing the reaction temperature, isobutane conversion increased monotonously, and isobutene yield increased from 5.7% at 773 K to 30.6% at 923 K."
[3] "Effects of the addition of lithium to iron-loaded activated carbon catalyst exhibited the smaller deactivation during the prolonged run."
[4] "During this treatment, magnetite was formed on the carbon surface."
[5] "No changes in the diffraction peaks were observed as compared to Fig. 8(b)."
[6] "The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene is to keep the magnetite phase in the catalytic process."

The document discusses the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene using iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts. It explains how the addition of iron to the catalyst increases the conversion of isobutane and the yield of isobutene. The maximum conversion reached 23.3% with an iron loading of 0.3 mmol/g of carbon. Higher temperatures also lead to an increase in isobutane conversion and isobutene yield. The addition of lithium to the catalyst helps maintain its activity over prolonged use. Magnetite is formed on the carbon surface during treatment with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide keeps the magnetite phase active, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. The document also notes that carbon deposition on the catalyst during the reaction reduces its surface area.

文档讨论了使用负载铁的活性炭催化剂进行异丁烷脱氢到异丁烯的过程。它解释了向催化剂中添加铁如何增加异丁烷的转化率和异丁烯的产率。最大转化率达到23.3%，铁加载量为0.3毫摩尔/克碳。提高温度也导致异丁烷转化率和异丁烯产率增加。向催化剂中添加锂有助于维持其在长期使用过程中的活性。在二氧化碳处理过程中，在碳表面形成磁铁矿。二氧化碳保持磁铁矿相的活性，促进脱氢反应。文档还指出，催化剂在反应期间沉积的碳减少了其表面积。
