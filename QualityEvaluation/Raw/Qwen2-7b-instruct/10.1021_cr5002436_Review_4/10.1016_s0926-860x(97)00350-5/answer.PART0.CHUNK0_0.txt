[1] "Effects of reaction conditions on the conversion of isobutane and the selectivity to isobutene will be discussed."
[2] "A 200600 mg portion of catalyst was placed in the center of the reactor by using a quartz glass wool plug."
[3] "At the efuent from the reactor, water was collected into a trap containing butanol."
[4] "Dehydrogenation activity of activated carbon or vanadium, nickel, and copper-loaded activated carbon was reported by Fujimoto in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane."
[5] "With increasing the reaction temperature, isobutane conversion increased monotonously, and isobutene yield increased from 5.7% at 773 K to 30.6% at 923 K."
[6] "Such decreases in the surface area could be attributed to the carbon deposition to the catalyst as reported previously."
[7] "This result indicates that isobutene is produced with both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, through the redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe."
[8] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K)."

The literature discusses how various carbon-based materials, including iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Key findings include:

1. Iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts show high isobutene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide. Loading 0.1-0.3 mmol of iron onto one gram of activated carbon significantly increases catalytic activity.
   
2. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that iron on the surface of the carbon support converts into magnetite under pretreatment with carbon dioxide at 973 K. Magnetite is considered the active phase of the catalyst.

3. The dehydrogenation of isobutane in carbon dioxide produces carbon monoxide and water, indicating both simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways through a redox cycle of Fe3O4 and Fe.

4. Carbon deposition on the catalyst during dehydrogenation leads to a decrease in surface area and an increase in weight, contributing to catalyst deactivation.

These findings suggest that carbon-based materials, especially those with iron loading, can be developed as efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially offering new avenues for the production of valuable olefins.

文献讨论了各种碳基材料，包括铁负载活性炭催化剂，在烷烃脱氢反应中的意外催化活性。主要发现包括：

1. 铁负载活性炭催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下显示出高异丁烯产率。将0.1-0.3毫摩尔的铁负载到每克活性炭上显著提高了催化活性。

2. X射线衍射分析显示，碳支持表面的铁在973 K下用二氧化碳预处理时转化为磁铁矿。磁铁矿被认为是催化剂的活性相。

3. 在二氧化碳气氛下进行的异丁烷脱氢产生一氧化碳和水，表明存在简单的脱氢化和氧化脱氢化途径，通过Fe3O4和Fe的氧化还原循环。

4. 催化剂在脱氢化过程中的碳沉积导致表面积减少和重量增加，从而导致催化剂失活。

这些发现表明，特别是带有铁负载的碳基材料可以作为烷烃脱氢反应的高效催化剂的发展，可能为生产有价值的烯烃开辟新的途径。
