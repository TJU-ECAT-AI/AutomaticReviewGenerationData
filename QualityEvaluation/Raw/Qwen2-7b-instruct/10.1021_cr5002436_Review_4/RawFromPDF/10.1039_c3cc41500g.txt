Revealing the enhanced catalytic activity of
nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes for oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane†

Bulk nitrogen doping can eﬃciently improve the catalytic performance
of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
(ODH). The graphitic nitrogen plays a determining role in enhancing
their activity by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing
the overall activation energy of the reaction.
In recent years, metal-free catalysis by carbon nanomaterials has
drawn a great deal of attention.1–6 Doping with heteroatoms
makes it possible to control the electronic properties and con-
sequential catalytic performance of nanocarbons by introducing
electron acceptors or donors.7 For instance, the electron-rich
nitrogen atoms in nitrogen doped CNT (NCNT) will provide
additional electrons for the graphitic lattice and give rise to
metallic or semi-conductive features with a narrow energy gap.8
Recent theoretical studies have shown that the incorporated N
atoms can reduce the gap between the highest-occupied mole-
cular orbitals and the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals,
which would make the electron transfer from the CNT to the
adsorbed oxygen species easy.9,10 An electron rearrangement of
O2 from the triplet ground state 3O2 to active 2O2
 occurs during
the adsorption process.9 These may promote the catalytic activity
of the CNT while catalyzing the oxygen-involving reactions, such
as selective oxidation of cyclohexane,5 conversion of hydrogen
sulfide,11 and electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen.2 In contrast,
the electron-attracting dopants like boron oxide will suppress the
formation of non-selective oxygen sites as well as the generation
of highly reactive oxygen species, leading to a quite low catalytic
activity in the propane ODH reaction.6
Here, we report the first experimental study of the nitrogen
doping eﬀect on ODH of propane as a high-temperature probe
reaction (400 1C) with the assistance of the chemical kinetics
method. NCNT and CNT catalysts were synthesized by a catalytic
CVD method and purified by concentrated HNO3 refluxing (see
details in the ESI†). Both propane activity and propene selectivity
were enhanced with the increasing N content. The N dopant was
found to speed up the dissociative adsorption of O2 molecules as
well as to reduce the overall activation energy. The analysis of
structure–performance correlation reveals that the graphitic
nitrogen species play a pivotal role in improving the catalytic
performance, in accordance with the prediction of previous
theoretical work.12
Fig. 1a shows C3H6 formation rates (R), i.e., rates normalized
by the specific surface area of used catalysts (ESI,† Table S1),4 as
a function of time-on-stream of NCNT and CNT catalysts. All
catalysts show increases in activities during the introduction
period due to the in situ rearrangements of functionalities and
carbon debris.6,13 Obviously, the undoped CNT displayed the
lowest activity. When doped with nitrogen, a large amount of
propene was produced and the formation rate showed a pro-
portional relationship with the N content. As the reaction
approached the steady state, NCNT-1 with the highest N%
value exhibited a superior activity of 8.8 mmol m2 h1, being
2.4 times that of the undoped CNT. The catalytic evaluation of

the FeMo/Al2O3 catalyst under the same conditions reveals an
inferior activity to all samples, proving the negligible eﬀect of
residual metals embedded in the graphitic matrix. Such an
improvement is quite diﬀerent from the suppressed activity of
the CNT by modification with boron and phosphorus oxides,6
indicating a particular promotion eﬀect of the nitrogen dopant.
The variation of selectivity to propene with the conversion of
propane was obtained by varying the space velocity (Fig. 1b). It
can be seen that the selectivity decreased when the conversion
increased and the highly doped sample displayed the highest
selectivity at the fixed conversion rate. The selectivity of NCNT-1
can reach around 65% when the conversion was extrapolated to
zero, indicating the reaction network with parallel and consecutive
hydrocarbon combustion in ODH reaction.3,14
To provide an intrinsic insight into the eﬀect of doped N
atoms, we measured the kinetic data of all catalysts in a
diﬀerential reactor free of heat and mass transfer limitations
(Table 1). Both reaction orders of propane and oxygen can be
derived by varying the partial pressures of feed gases, while the
activation energy (Ea, kJ mol1) was obtained by means of the
Arrhenius relationship (ESI,† Fig. S1). The doped samples
exhibited a superior activity 1.6–3.5 times that of undoped
CNT. With the increasing N content, the O2 reaction order
and Ea solely decreased while the C3H8 reaction order varied
(0.60  0.05). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
to investigate the promotion effect of doped nitrogen on the
alkane conversion by the chemical kinetics method.
The morphologies of these carbon catalysts were examined
by high-resolution TEM. Fig. 2a shows a representative TEM
image of the fresh NCNT-1 sample, revealing a typical bamboo-
like structure with interlinked stacked compartments. The
doped nanotubes consisted of corrugated graphitic walls with
an interlayer spacing of 0.342–0.343 nm, which was slightly
larger than 0.335 nm in non-doped sample (ESI,† Fig. S2). This
difference is known to originate from the substitution of
nitrogen atoms in the graphitic domain, which would increase
the curvature of the graphene layer and thus the spacing of
interlayer walls.15,16 The post HNO3 purification generated
similar surface disorder, being proved by the close D/G ratio
in Raman spectra (ESI,† Fig. S3 and Table S2). Nitrogen atoms
were homogenously distributed throughout the carbon frame-
work, as illustrated by the elemental maps in Fig. 2b. This can be
confirmed by the results of XPS and elemental analysis in
Table 1, which shows a negligible difference between the surface
and bulk N contents. The distribution of oxygen atoms generated
from HNO3 refluxing was also revealed. Most carbon atoms were
sp2-hyridized as reflected by the characteristic p* and s* transi-
tions in the carbon K edge.4,17,18 The wrinkled multiwalled
characteristics of NCNT further led to weakening of p* resonance
and thus a weaker p* signal in the nitrogen K edge.19 The similar
spectral feature of C and N K edges indicates the incorporation
of N atoms in the carbon sp2 network.
The thermal stability of all samples was examined by the
temperature-programmed oxidation. The N-doped CNT samples
still show good thermal stability, the minimum peak temperature
(Tmax) is 630 1C for NCNT-1 (ESI,† Fig. S4). The total amount of ash
in NCNT samples was around 3.8%, being less than that in CNT,
i.e., 4.27% (ESI,† Fig. S4). XPS of all samples was performed to
analyze the surface chemical composition. In the survey curve of
XPS spectra, the peaks centred at 284.5, 401 and 532 eV corre-
spond to C1s, N1s, and O1s, respectively (ESI,† Fig. S5). Both
survey and core level spectra confirmed the absence of metal on
the surface. The O1s peak was carefully deconvolved into four
components, i.e., quinonic C
Q
O (O1), ketonic C
Q
O (O2), ether-
like C–O–C (O3) and hydroxyl C–OH (O4) groups (ESI,† Fig. S6).20
As depicted in Fig. 3a, all the used samples have an approximate
total oxygen amount (ESI,† Table S3), suggesting the removal of
unstable oxygen species during the ODH reaction.6 Previous
studies revealed that the quinone- and/or ketone-like function-
alities were active in ODH reaction.21 However, we did not
observe the direct correlation between the amount of active
C
Q
O species and reaction rate in this work.
The surface atomic nitrogen content of used NCNT-1, NCNT-2
and NCNT-3 is 1.44, 0.57 and 0.47%, in accordance with the
similar value of N% in the bulk (Table 1). Noting that nearly one
fourth of nitrogen was lost after ODH reaction whereas the

catalytic performance of NCNTs remained fairly stable, we
interpret that some functionalities were degraded and played a
negligible role in the reaction. The asymmetric N1s spectra of
doped samples can be fitted to five peaks centered at 398.5,
400.4, 401.4, 403.6 and 405.6 eV, which are assigned to pyridinic
N (N1), pyrrolic N and/or pyridone (N2), graphitic N (N3),
pyridine-N-oxide (N4) and C–O–N (N5), respectively (ESI,†
Fig. S7 and Table S4).20,22,23 For the first two types, the N atoms
occupied the vertex of a hexagon and a pentagon at the exposed
defects or the edge of a graphitic sheet and were unstable due
to the high density of electrons.13,24 The latter two species,
pyridine-N-oxide and C–O–N, generated by refluxing with nitric
acid, can also be formed through the oxidation of N1 and N2
species under the ODH reaction conditions. As the primary
component, the graphitic N (N3) is a nitrogen atom located in
the hexagonal graphitic structure and donates two electrons to
the p band of carbon.25 The donated electrons could migrate to
adsorbed species and make them more reactive, suggesting a
close relationship between graphitic N and the reaction rate as
illustrated in Fig. 3b and ESI,† Fig. S8. Furthermore, the amount
of graphitic N in used samples was quite close to that in fresh
samples (ESI,† Fig. S9), in accordance with the observed stability
in Fig. 1a.
Previous studies revealed that the adsorption and activation
of gas-phase molecular oxygen occurred at the defects.26,27 It
was shown that the nitrogen doping favours the adsorption of
oxygen (ESI,† Fig. S10). Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to
the graphitic sheet25 and improve the electron mobility from
the basal plane to the intermediate O2
, promoting the final
dissociation of gas-phase O2 to nucleophilic O2 species. For
the ODH process, the doped N atoms reduce the dependence
of the reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure and finally
decrease the reaction order of oxygen (Fig. 3b). There is no
apparent correlation between propane order and graphitic N
since the C
Q
O component is responsible for breaking C–H
bonds in propane molecules.4 Despite the rate-limiting C–H
scission, the formation of H2O with the assistance of active
oxygen species is also important to regenerate the exposed
C
Q
O sites. The improved surface coverage of blank active sites
(y0) for propane conversion is therefore believed to be the
reason for the enhanced ODH activity. In addition, the doped
N atoms may facilitate propene to desorb from the surface due
to the repulsion between the electron-rich graphitic surface and
unsaturated C
Q
C bonds of propene (ESI,† Fig. S11). Apparently,
the graphitic N played a vital role in reducing the overall activation
energy (Fig. 3b) and consequently increasing the reaction rate.9,12,28
A similar role was also proven in oxygen reduction reaction (ESI,†
Fig. S12). Furthermore, a linear relationship between activation
energy and the atomic abundance of graphitic N (N3, atom%) can
be fitted by the empirical equation Ea = 117.2–32.7  N3 to
quantitatively describe the role of graphitic N in decreasing the
activation energy of ODH.
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated that the
doping of nitrogen can eﬃciently enhance the catalytic perfor-
mance of CNT. The doped CNT catalysts with suitable content
of graphitic nitrogen are quite stable and more active for the
ODH of propane. We believe that the graphitic nitrogen may
play a determining role in enhancing the catalytic activity by
decreasing the overall activation energy and speeding up the
activation of oxygen. Obviously, the bulk doping is quite
diﬀerent from the surface modification or grafting with the
heteroatoms and thus expands our knowledge of carbon catalysis.
Such a concept can be used for other reactions such as selective
oxidation, electrochemical oxygen reduction, peroxidation, etc.
Future development of heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts requires
considerable eﬀorts on both theoretical calculation and materials
synthesis.
