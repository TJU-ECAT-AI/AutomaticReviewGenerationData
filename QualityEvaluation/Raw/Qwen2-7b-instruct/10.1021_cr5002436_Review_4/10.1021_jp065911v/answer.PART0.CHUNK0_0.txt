1. Various carbon-based materials such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons show unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the formation of active sites on their surfaces. This phenomenon is influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry, which contribute to the development of more efficient carbon-based catalysts.
