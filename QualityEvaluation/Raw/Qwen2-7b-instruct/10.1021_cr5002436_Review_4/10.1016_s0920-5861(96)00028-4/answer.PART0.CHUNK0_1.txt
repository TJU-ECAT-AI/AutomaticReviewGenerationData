What are the key differences in structure and function of metal cations in light alkane reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5?

</questions>

<quotes>
"Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Metal cations like Gallium (Ga) and Zinc (Zn) enhance the rates of propane conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation in reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5. They facilitate the removal of hydrogen atoms by transferring them to unsaturated species, forming alkanes or catalyzing the recombinative desorption of hydrogen to produce dihydrogen (H2). The release of multiple hydrogen atoms during a single dehydrocyclodimerization process constrains the reaction rate and selectivity on H-ZSM5.
