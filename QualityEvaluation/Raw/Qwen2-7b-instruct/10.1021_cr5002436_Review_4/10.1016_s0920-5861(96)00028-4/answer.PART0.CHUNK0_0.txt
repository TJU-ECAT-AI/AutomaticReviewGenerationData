C-H activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.
Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products.
The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.
In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover.
These monomeric species form directly during exchange of Zn ions from solution onto H-ZSM5. Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals.
The catalytic role and the structure and location of metal cations in light alkane aromatization remains the subject of intense controversy even after significant emphasis and numerous publications.
