C-H activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.
Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D 2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2).

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The proposed mechanisms involve fast hydrogen desorption facilitated by the presence of Ga and Zn species, which increase the rates of chemical conversion and recombinative hydrogen desorption. This allows for the rapid removal of hydrogen atoms from the surface, minimizing unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane. The influence of temperature and surface chemistry on this phenomenon is significant, as higher temperatures enhance the activity of these materials by promoting the desorption of hydrogen. The implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are profound, offering a pathway to more selective and environmentally friendly processes for the conversion of light alkanes into valuable products like aromatics and hydrogen.
