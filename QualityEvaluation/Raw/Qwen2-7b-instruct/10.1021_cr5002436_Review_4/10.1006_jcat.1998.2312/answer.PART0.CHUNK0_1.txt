[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields,and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane,and propene aromatization."
[2] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."
[3] "Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates."
[4] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatisation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."

The literature discusses how modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc (Zn) cations enhance the catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, specifically for ethane, propane, and propene. Zinc ions increase the turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates. The rate of propene aromatization (r2) compared to propene hydrogenation (r1) is higher on samples containing zinc than on H-ZSM5 zeolites, despite zinc increasing the rate of dehydrogenation steps. Zinc ions not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation but also contribute to alkene conversion. By enhancing the rate of recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms produced in C-H activation steps, zinc accelerates the alkane aromatization process.

文献讨论了如何通过将五元硅沸石改性并引入锌（Zn）离子来增强烷烃脱氢反应的催化活性，特别是在乙烷、丙烷和丙烯的芳香化过程中。锌离子提高了转化率、芳基位时间产率和氢气的排放速率。丙烯芳香化（r2）与丙烯氢化（r1）的比例在含锌样品中比在H-ZSM5沸石上更高，尽管锌增加了脱氢步骤的速率。锌离子不仅催化烷烃脱氢，还促进了烯烃的转化。通过提高在C-H活化步骤中生成的氢原子的再组合脱附速率，锌加速了烷烃的芳香化过程。
