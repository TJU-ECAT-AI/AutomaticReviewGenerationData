[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."
[2] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."
[3] "Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates."
[4] "These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatization by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps."
[5] "Hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps, however, remain irreversible (rate-determining) even on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts."

1.Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc (Zn) cations enhance the rates of ethane, propane, and propene aromatization, increasing turnover rates and aromatic site-time yields. 
2.The ratio of propene aromatization to propene hydrogenation rates is elevated on samples with Zn cations compared to H-ZSM5, even as Zn boosts dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps.
3.Zn cations catalyze not just alkane dehydrogenation, but also alkene conversion processes.
4.Zn cations elevate alkane aromatization rates by accelerating the rate of hydrogen atoms' recombinative desorption from C-H activation steps.
5.Despite Zn cations' influence, hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps remain irreversible on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts.

1.用交换锌（Zn）离子修改五硅酸盐沸石，可以增强乙烷、丙烷和丙烯的芳构化，提高转化率和芳烃生成速率。
2.Zn含样品中，丙烯芳构化与氢化速率比高于H-ZSM5，尽管Zn加速了脱氢氢化步骤。
3.Zn离子不仅催化烷烃脱氢，还催化烯烃转换。
4.Zn离子通过加快C-H激活步骤中形成的氢原子的重组脱附速率，提高了烷烃的芳构化速率。
5.尽管存在Zn离子的影响，Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上的氢吸附-脱附步骤仍保持不可逆性。
