[1] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields,and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane,and propene aromatization."
[2] "The ratio of propene aromatization (r2) to propene hydrogenation (r1) rates is higher on Zn-containing samples than on H-ZSM5, even though Zn cations increase the rate of dehydrogenation hydrogenation steps (r1, r1)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses how modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged zinc (Zn) cations enhance the catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, specifically for ethane, propane, and propene. Zinc ions increase the turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates. The rate of propene aromatization (r2) compared to propene hydrogenation (r1) is higher on samples containing zinc than on H-ZSM5 zeolites, despite zinc increasing the rate of dehydrogenation steps. Zinc ions not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation but also contribute to alkene conversion. By enhancing the rate of recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms produced in C-H activation steps, zinc accelerates the alkane aromatization process.

文献讨论了如何通过将五元硅沸石改性并引入锌（Zn）离子来增强烷烃脱氢反应的催化活性，特别是在乙烷、丙烷和丙烯的芳香化过程中。锌离子提高了转化率、芳基位时间产率和氢气的排放速率。丙烯芳香化（r2）与丙烯氢化（r1）的比例在含锌样品中比在H-ZSM5沸石上更高，尽管锌增加了脱氢步骤的速率。锌离子不仅催化烷烃脱氢，还促进了烯烃的转化。通过提高在C-H活化步骤中生成的氢原子的再组合脱附速率，锌加速了烷烃的芳香化过程。

[1] "Reactions of ethane and propane on H-ZSM5 lead primarily to undesired products of β-scission reactions."
[2] "Turnover rates, aro- matic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during alkane conversion increase as the density of exchanged Zn cations increases in H-ZSM5."
[3] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles,leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aro- matic products."
[4] "Reactions of propene/2-13C propane mixtures show that initial dehydrogenation steps become increasingly irreversible as Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms and H2."
[5] "C3H8/C3D8 isotopic exchange rates are much higher than propane conversion rates."
[6] "On Zn/H-ZSM5, propane conversion turnover rates and aromatic selectivities decrease as H2 pressure increases (0 < 26.6kPaH2), because adsorption desorptions sites provided by Zn cations allow gas phase hydrogen pressures to influence surface hydrogen concentrations and the rate of hydrogenation dehydrogenation steps."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Ethane and propane reactions on H-ZSM5 predominantly produce β-scission products, while the introduction of Zn cations modifies these reactions, increasing turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during alkane conversion.

2. The presence of Zn cations in H-ZSM5 reduces β-scission reaction rates and extends the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to a preference for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products.

3. The initial dehydrogenation steps of propene become increasingly irreversible on Zn/H-ZSM5 as Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms and H2.

4. The isotopic exchange rates between C3H8 and C3D8 are significantly higher compared to propane conversion rates.

5. Increasing the pressure of H2 in the gas phase decreases the propane conversion rates and aromatic selectivities on Zn/H-ZSM5 due to enhanced hydrogen adsorption and desorption sites provided by Zn cations.

6. Zn cations facilitate the catalytic conversion of propene to aromatics on Zn/H-ZSM5, but this process becomes less favorable with increased H2 pressure, as hydrogen adsorption and desorption rates increase.

1. 乙烷和丙烷在H-ZSM5上的反应主要产生β裂解产物，而引入Zn离子改变了这些反应，提高了转化速率、芳香位时间产率以及烷烃转化过程中的氢气排放速率。

2. 在H-ZSM5中加入Zn离子降低了β裂解反应速率，并延长了烯烃在寡聚化/β裂解循环中的停留时间，导致更倾向于合成C6-C8芳香化合物。

3. Zn离子催化丙烯的初始脱氢步骤变得更加不可逆，因为丙烯中的氢原子和H2通过重组脱附被Zn离子催化。

4. C3H8与C3D8之间的同位素交换速率显著高于丙烷转化速率。

5. 随着H2气体压力的增加，在Zn/H-ZSM5上，丙烷转化速率和芳香选择性降低，因为Zn离子提供的吸附和脱附位点使气体相氢压力影响表面氢浓度和氢化/脱氢步骤速率。

6. Zn离子促进了丙烯向芳香化合物的催化转化在Zn/H-ZSM5上，但随着H2压力的增加，这一过程变得不太有利，因为氢吸附和脱附速率增加。
