1. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics and H2 via nonoxidative routes significantly expands the feedstocks available for synthesis of these valuable products.
2. There is mechanistic evidence for bifunctional pathways in the conversion of ethane and propane to aromatics on H-ZSM5 modified by Zn cations.
3. The role of metal cations in light alkane aromatisation is still controversial despite much emphasis and publications.
4. This study provides mechanistic evidence for bifunctional pathways in the conversion of ethane and propane to aromatics on H-ZSM5 modified by Zn cations.
5. Zn cations not only catalyze alkane dehydrogenation (r1), but also alkene conversion rates.
6. These Zn cations increase the rates of alkane aromatisation by increasing the rate of recombinative desorption of the hydrogen atoms formed in C-H activation steps.

1. 轻烷烃通过非氧化路线转化为芳烃和H2，极大地扩展了合成这些宝贵产品可用的原料。
2. 对于轻烷烃转化为芳烃的双功能途径，在H-ZSM5上通过锌离子改性提供了机制证据。
3. 金属离子在轻烷烃芳香化中的作用仍然存在争议，尽管已经给予了大量关注和多篇发表。
4. 此研究提供了在H-ZSM5上通过锌离子改性转化轻烷烃和丙烷到芳烃的双功能途径的机制证据。
5. 锌离子不仅催化烷烃脱氢化（r1），而且催化烯烃转化速率。
6. 这些锌离子通过增加氢原子在C-H激活步骤中形成的再组合脱附速率，提高了烷烃芳香化率。
7. 然而，氢吸附脱附步骤在锌/ZSM5催化剂上仍然是不可逆的（决定速率）。
