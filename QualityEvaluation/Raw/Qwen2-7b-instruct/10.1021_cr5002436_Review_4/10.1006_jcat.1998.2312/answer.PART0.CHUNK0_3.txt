[1] "The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics and H2 via nonoxidative routes significantly expands the feedstocks available for synthesis of these valuable products."
[2] "The presence of Zn increases the rate of H2/D2 isotopic equilibration and the rate of deuterium incorporation into the products of C3H8/D2 reactions."
[3] "As H2 am- bient pressures increase, the surface of Zn/H-ZSM5 also becomes hydrogen-rich and surface intermediates and gas phase products become increasingly saturated; they resem- ble those formed on hydrogen-rich H-ZSM5 surfaces."

1. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics and hydrogen via non-oxidative pathways broadens the potential feedstocks for producing valuable products.
2. Zinc ions enhance the rate of hydrogen isotopic equilibrium and deuterium incorporation into products from C3H8/D2 mixtures.
3. As ambient hydrogen pressures rise, the surface of Zn/H-ZSM5 becomes enriched in hydrogen, leading to increasingly saturated surface intermediates and gas phase products resembling those on hydrogen-rich H-ZSM5 surfaces.

1. 轻烷烃转化为芳香族化合物和氢气的非氧化性途径显著扩大了可用于合成这些有价值产品的原料来源。
2. 锌离子提高了氢气和氘在C3H8/D2混合物反应产物中的同位素平衡速率以及氘的整合速率。
3. 随着环境氢压的增加，Zn/H-ZSM5表面的氢含量增加，导致表面中间体和气体相产物逐渐饱和，类似于氢富集的H-ZSM5表面形成的产物。
