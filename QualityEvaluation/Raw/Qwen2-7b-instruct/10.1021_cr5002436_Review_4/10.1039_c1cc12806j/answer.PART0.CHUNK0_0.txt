"Dehydrogenation of propane has attracted considerable attention due to the growing demand for propylene. The industrial catalytic processes generally use chromia- or platinum-based catalysts supported on alumina and promoted with alkali metals.1,2 However, the major challenges associated with this catalytic system are the coking and cracking which influence the catalyst stability and propylene selectivity, respectively."

"The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure. The main by-products are methane, ethane and ethene for all the tested carbons (ESI, Fig. S4), but much more by-products are present for CMK-3."

"After 7 h, the conversion of propane is as low as 6.7% over CNTs, yielding 5.8% propylene. GC is much less active with propane conversion of 4.0%, yielding 3.0% propylene after only two hours on stream."

"Previous reports showed that nanostructured carbon material,i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions,610 provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane. It has been accepted that the existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction,9 since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

"In comparison, ordered mesoporous carbons show much higher catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions. The XPS and TPD results confirm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups is essential for a good catalytic activity."

"Meanwhile, deactivation of the C

O active site can be further induced by hydrogen passivation during the prolonged reaction period.22"

"In summary, ordered mesoporous carbons have been applied as a new catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene under steam-free conditions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity, as well as good stability."

1. Metal-free ordered mesoporous carbons exhibit high activity and selectivity in direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene compared to traditional metal-based catalysts. Challenges with conventional systems include coking and cracking, affecting catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

2. When tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor, the ordered mesoporous carbons showed high initial activity in propane dehydrogenation, converting 69.3% to 65.7% of propane into propylene. The catalytic activity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and commercial graphite carbon (GC) was significantly lower, with CNTs converting only 6.59% of propane.

3. Nanostructured carbon materials such as CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, and carbon onions have been found to be effective catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. Oxygen is crucial for these reactions, as it maintains active sites in their oxidation state.

4. Ordered mesoporous carbons demonstrate higher catalytic activity than nanostructured carbons in propane dehydrogenation. The presence of carbonyl and quinone groups on the surface of these carbons is critical for their catalytic activity.

5. During prolonged reaction periods, hydrogen passivation can lead to deactivation of the active sites on the surface of the catalysts. However, the ordered mesoporous carbons maintain high stability, allowing for consistent performance over time.
