[1] "Metal-free ordered mesoporous carbons were demonstrated to be robust catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, in the absence of any auxiliary steam, exhibiting high activity and selectivity, as well as long catalytic stability, in comparison with nanostructured carbons."
[2] "However, little effort to date has been focused on the direct dehydrogenation reaction over mesoporous carbon materials, though nanocarbons have been found to be efficient in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene and butane."
[3] "It has been revealed that these ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, despite there being no metal deposited, exhibiting higher catalytic activity and stability than the conventional metal-supported systems."
[4] "The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings."
[5] "The presence of surface carbonyl groups is responsible for the dehydrogenation activity. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts should also be beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reaction, exhibiting long time stability."
[6] "Meanwhile, deactivation of the C

O active site can be further induced by hydrogen passivation during the prolonged reaction period."
[7] "The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass transport and good thermal stability."

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the presence of surface carbonyl groups. These groups serve as active sites that activate saturated hydrocarbons, leading to the production of propylene. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts enhances mass transport and stability, contributing to the high activity and selectivity. Factors such as temperature and surface chemistry influence the catalytic performance. For instance, hydrogen passivation during prolonged reaction periods can induce deactivation of the active sites. This phenomenon implies the potential for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts that operate without auxiliary steam, offering energy savings and improved industrial applications. The stable propylene yield and steady propylene selectivity indicate promising indications for practical use.
