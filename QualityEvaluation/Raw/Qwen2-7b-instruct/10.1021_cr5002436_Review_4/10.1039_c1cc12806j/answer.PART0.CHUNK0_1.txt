[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane has attracted considerable attention due to the growing demand for propylene."
[2] "However, the major challenges associated with this catalytic system are the coking and cracking which influence the catalyst stability and propylene selectivity, respectively."
[3] "Developing new efficient catalyst systems to improve catalytic performance, especially allowing long-time production of propylene with high selectivity at higher propane conversions,is of great importance."
[4] "Mesoporous carbon materials offer the possibility of creating reaction sites and molecular confinement that permit the selective formation of reaction products in heterogeneous catalysis."
[5] "However, little effort to date has been focused on the direct dehydrogenation reaction over mesoporous carbon materials, though nanocarbons have been found to be efficient in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene and butane."
[6] "The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings."

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique properties. These materials offer the possibility of creating reaction sites and molecular confinement, which allows for the selective formation of reaction products in heterogeneous catalysis. The presence of oxygen is considered indispensable for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, as active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2. However, in the case of propane dehydrogenation over mesoporous carbon materials, the materials show much higher catalytic activity compared to traditional metal-supported systems. The proposed mechanisms involve the presence of surface carbonyl groups, which are responsible for the dehydrogenation activity. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts is also beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reactions, leading to long-term stability. The stable propylene yield higher than 38% and steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during a reaction of 100 h indicate a promising indication for industrial applications, considering the absence of auxiliary steam and potential energy savings.

各种碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和复合纳米碳，通过其独特的性质，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性。这些材料提供了创建反应位点和分子限制的可能性，允许在异质催化作用下选择性地形成反应产物。氧气被认为是氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的关键，因为合成过程中生成的二酮类和/或酮类活性位点通过与反应物O2接触保持在氧化状态。然而，在使用介孔碳材料进行丙烷脱氢的情况下，材料显示了与传统金属支持系统相比更高的催化活性。提议的机制涉及表面羰基的存在，这是脱氢活动的原因。介孔碳催化剂的大而有序的孔隙结构也有利于催化反应中的质量传输，从而导致长期稳定性。丙烯稳定产量高于38%，并保持约88%的选择性长达100小时的反应，表明工业应用有前景的迹象，考虑到没有辅助蒸汽和潜在的能量节省。
