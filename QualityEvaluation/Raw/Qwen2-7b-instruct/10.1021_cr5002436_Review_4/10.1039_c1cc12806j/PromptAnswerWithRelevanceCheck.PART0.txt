"Dehydrogenation of propane has attracted considerable attention due to the growing demand for propylene. The industrial catalytic processes generally use chromia- or platinum-based catalysts supported on alumina and promoted with alkali metals.1,2 However, the major challenges associated with this catalytic system are the coking and cracking which influence the catalyst stability and propylene selectivity, respectively."

"The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure. The main by-products are methane, ethane and ethene for all the tested carbons (ESI, Fig. S4), but much more by-products are present for CMK-3."

"After 7 h, the conversion of propane is as low as 6.7% over CNTs, yielding 5.8% propylene. GC is much less active with propane conversion of 4.0%, yielding 3.0% propylene after only two hours on stream."

"Previous reports showed that nanostructured carbon material,i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions,610 provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane. It has been accepted that the existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction,9 since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

"In comparison, ordered mesoporous carbons show much higher catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions. The XPS and TPD results confirm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups is essential for a good catalytic activity."

"Meanwhile, deactivation of the C
Q
O active site can be further induced by hydrogen passivation during the prolonged reaction period.22"

"In summary, ordered mesoporous carbons have been applied as a new catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene under steam-free conditions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity, as well as good stability."

1. Metal-free ordered mesoporous carbons exhibit high activity and selectivity in direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene compared to traditional metal-based catalysts. Challenges with conventional systems include coking and cracking, affecting catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

2. When tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor, the ordered mesoporous carbons showed high initial activity in propane dehydrogenation, converting 69.3% to 65.7% of propane into propylene. The catalytic activity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and commercial graphite carbon (GC) was significantly lower, with CNTs converting only 6.59% of propane.

3. Nanostructured carbon materials such as CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, and carbon onions have been found to be effective catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. Oxygen is crucial for these reactions, as it maintains active sites in their oxidation state.

4. Ordered mesoporous carbons demonstrate higher catalytic activity than nanostructured carbons in propane dehydrogenation. The presence of carbonyl and quinone groups on the surface of these carbons is critical for their catalytic activity.

5. During prolonged reaction periods, hydrogen passivation can lead to deactivation of the active sites on the surface of the catalysts. However, the ordered mesoporous carbons maintain high stability, allowing for consistent performance over time.

2. 在固定床管式反应器中测试时，有序介孔碳表现出高初始活性，在丙烷脱氢中转化了69.3%至65.7%的丙烷为丙烯。碳纳米管（CNTs）和商用石墨碳（GC）的催化活性显著较低，CNTs仅将6.59%的丙烷转化为丙烯。

3. 纳米结构碳材料如CNTs、GC、碳纳米纤维和碳洋葱在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中被发现是有效的催化剂。氧气对于这些反应至关重要，因为它维持了合成过程中的活性位点在其氧化状态。

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique properties. These materials offer the possibility of creating reaction sites and molecular confinement, which allows for the selective formation of reaction products in heterogeneous catalysis. The presence of oxygen is considered indispensable for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, as active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2. However, in the case of propane dehydrogenation over mesoporous carbon materials, the materials show much higher catalytic activity compared to traditional metal-supported systems. The proposed mechanisms involve the presence of surface carbonyl groups, which are responsible for the dehydrogenation activity. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts is also beneficial for mass transport in catalytic reactions, leading to long-term stability. The stable propylene yield higher than 38% and steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during a reaction of 100 h indicate a promising indication for industrial applications, considering the absence of auxiliary steam and potential energy savings.

The proposed mechanisms involve the creation of reaction sites and molecular confinement by mesoporous carbon materials, which permit the selective formation of propylene. The presence of oxygen on the carbon surface is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction, and the active sites are generated during synthesis and maintained by contact with the reactant O2. Temperature plays a significant role in the activation and deactivation of these active sites. The surface chemistry of the carbon materials, such as the abundance of oxygen functional groups, also influences the catalytic activity. The findings suggest that ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane, even without metal deposition, showing higher activity and stability compared to conventional metal-supported systems. This has important implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly for long-term production of propylene with high selectivity and reduced energy consumption.

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the presence of surface carbonyl groups. These groups serve as active sites that activate saturated hydrocarbons, leading to the production of propylene. The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts enhances mass transport and stability, contributing to the high activity and selectivity. Factors such as temperature and surface chemistry influence the catalytic performance. For instance, hydrogen passivation during prolonged reaction periods can induce deactivation of the active sites. This phenomenon implies the potential for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts that operate without auxiliary steam, offering energy savings and improved industrial applications. The stable propylene yield and steady propylene selectivity indicate promising indications for practical use.

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, unexpectedly exhibit catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon is attributed to the unique properties of these materials, such as large surface areas and uniform pore sizes, which facilitate the creation of reaction sites and molecular confinement. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of alkane molecules through interaction with the material's surface, leading to the selective formation of reaction products. Temperature and surface chemistry play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of these materials as catalysts. The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant, as it suggests potential improvements in the dehydrogenation process, particularly in the absence of auxiliary steam. The use of ordered mesoporous carbons, which lack metals yet demonstrate higher catalytic activity and stability compared to conventional metal-supported systems, highlights the promise of these materials for industrial applications. The reported stable propylene yields and selectivities indicate that carbon-based catalysts could offer energy savings and enhanced productivity in the production of propylene from propane, making them a promising alternative to existing industrial processes.
