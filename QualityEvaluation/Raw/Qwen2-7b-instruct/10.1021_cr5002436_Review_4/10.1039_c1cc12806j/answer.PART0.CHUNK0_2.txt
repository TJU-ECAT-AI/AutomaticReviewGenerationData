[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane has attracted considerable attention due to the growing demand for propylene."
[2] "The industrial catalytic processes generally use chromia- or platinum-based catalysts supported on alumina and promoted with alkali metals."
[3] "However, the major challenges associated with this catalytic system are the coking and cracking which influence the catalyst stability and propylene selectivity, respectively."
[4] "None of the current dehydrogenation processes are perfect and ways of improving the process are always being sought."
[5] "Developing new efficient catalyst systems to improve catalytic performance, especially allowing long-time production of propylene with high selectivity at higher propane conversions, is of great importance."
[6] "Mesoporous carbon materials offer the possibility of creating reaction sites and molecular confinement that permit the selective formation of reaction products in heterogeneous catalysis."
[7] "However, little effort to date has been focused on the direct dehydrogenation reaction over mesoporous carbon materials, though nanocarbons have been found to be efficient in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene and butane."
[8] "We report here the catalytic performance in the steam-free dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over metal-free ordered mesoporous carbon materials."
[9] "It has been revealed that these ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, despite there being no metal deposited, exhibiting higher catalytic activity and stability than the conventional metal-supported systems."
[10] "The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure."
[11] "The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings."

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The proposed mechanisms involve the creation of reaction sites and molecular confinement by mesoporous carbon materials, which permit the selective formation of propylene. The presence of oxygen on the carbon surface is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction, and the active sites are generated during synthesis and maintained by contact with the reactant O2. Temperature plays a significant role in the activation and deactivation of these active sites. The surface chemistry of the carbon materials, such as the abundance of oxygen functional groups, also influences the catalytic activity. The findings suggest that ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane, even without metal deposition, showing higher activity and stability compared to conventional metal-supported systems. This has important implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly for long-term production of propylene with high selectivity and reduced energy consumption.
