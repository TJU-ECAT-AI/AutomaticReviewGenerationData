[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane has attracted considerable attention due to the growing demand for propylene."
[2] "None of the current dehydrogenation processes are perfect and ways of improving the process are always being sought."
[3] "With their large surface area and uniform pore sizes, mesoporous carbon materials offer the possibility of creating reaction sites and molecular confinement that permit the selective formation of reaction products in heterogeneous catalysis."
[4] "However, little effort to date has been focused on the direct dehydrogenation reaction over mesoporous carbon materials."
[5] "It has been revealed that these ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, despite there being no metal deposited, exhibiting higher catalytic activity and stability than the conventional metal-supported systems."
[6] "The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure."
[7] "As the catalytic activities of different carbon catalysts summarized in Table 1, the initial activities (15 min in steam) at 873 K measured by the conversion for OMC-1 and OMC-2 are 69.3% and 65.7% with propylene yields of 43.1% and 46.4%, respectively, much greater than that of CMK-3 carbon catalyst (propane conversion of 54.3% with propylene yield of 15%)."
[8] "The stable propylene yield higher than 38%, together with the steady propylene selectivity of approximately 88% during reaction of 100 h reported here, is a promising indication for industrial applications, taking into account the absence of auxiliary steam and the subsequent energy savings."

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, unexpectedly exhibit catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon is attributed to the unique properties of these materials, such as large surface areas and uniform pore sizes, which facilitate the creation of reaction sites and molecular confinement. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of alkane molecules through interaction with the material's surface, leading to the selective formation of reaction products. Temperature and surface chemistry play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of these materials as catalysts. The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant, as it suggests potential improvements in the dehydrogenation process, particularly in the absence of auxiliary steam. The use of ordered mesoporous carbons, which lack metals yet demonstrate higher catalytic activity and stability compared to conventional metal-supported systems, highlights the promise of these materials for industrial applications. The reported stable propylene yields and selectivities indicate that carbon-based catalysts could offer energy savings and enhanced productivity in the production of propylene from propane, making them a promising alternative to existing industrial processes.
