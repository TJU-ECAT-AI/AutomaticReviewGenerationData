<quotes>
[1] "The Russo- Turkish War and the Sino- Japanese War made headlines even in such journals as the Russian Russkij Vstnik and the German Deutsche Rundschau, both of which dealt as much with culture and literature as with politics."
[2] "Articles in Russkij Vstnik, the journal in which Leo Tolstoys Anna Karenina first appeared, not only condemned the Turks for their invasion of the Slavic world but also described them as belonging to an Asian tribe incapable of becoming truly civilized like the European peoples to which many Russians felt they belonged."
[3] "Effi hears about the Chinese man on the way to her new home in the port-town of Kessin in East Pommerania. Her husband tells her that the house they will share once was owned by a sea captain named Thomsen who had returned from business in Asia with a Chinese man as his servant."
[4] "When Effi moves into her home, the Chinese man returns as a ghost that haunts her bedroom."
[5] "Ironically, Innstettens various negative comments about Slavs achieve the opposite effect of his intentions, since Effi does not lose her interest in non-German peoples."

[1] "Articles in the Deutsche Rundschau evince such fear of competition from Asia."
[2] "Effi Briest is connected to a discussion outside the novel concerning competition from a potentially aggressive Asia."
[3] "In fact, Effi Briest is connected to a discussion outside the novel concerning competition from a potentially aggressive Asia."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
These quotes highlight the connection between the serial novel Effi Briest and broader societal concerns about the potential aggression from Asia. The German public's fear of Asian competition and its implications for European civilization are reflected in the depiction of the Chinese ghost in Effi Briest's bedroom. This character serves as a metaphor for the foreign threat that is present in the narrative, paralleling the anxieties expressed in the articles of the Deutsche Rundschau.

[1] "European apprehensions about powerful Mongols fed growing fears of inter-racial competition."
[2] "The industrialization of East Asia in the 1880s led to concern about Europes ability to compete against such a densely populated part of the world."
[3] "Articles in the Deutsche Rundschau evince such fear of competition from Asia."
[4] "One article described general European interest in Asia in terms of a desire to secure Asian ports that would ensure a steady flow of Asian goods to Europe."
[5] "Another factor that added to a negative view of China was the Chinese resistance to Christianity."
[6] "Effi hears about the Chinese man on the way to her new home in the port-town of Kessin in East Pommerania."
[7] "The society in which Effi finds herself, however, embraces the German ethnic nationalism prevalent in nineteenth-century Prussia and does not encourage her to indulge her natural inclinations."
[8] "Innstetten presents Effi with mixed impressions of Kessin and initially seems to support her enthusiasm by explaining that the port receives ships from all over the world and that one can find even the banners of the Chinese Dragon in Kessin."
[9] "Above all, the story about the Chinese man who died in Kessin transforms Effi's view of other cultures, and Innstetten points out that the man still lies buried in the dunes near the seaside, a place he describes as both alluring and eerie."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document reveals that European fears of Asian competition, particularly from the rapidly industrializing East Asia in the 1880s, contributed to a broader sense of inter-racial competition and anxiety. Europeans showed interest in securing access to Asian markets, particularly through strategic ports. Concerns about the Chinese, who resisted Christianity and were perceived as a racially distinct and populous threat, were also highlighted. The Chinese presence, especially through the mention of the Chinese dragon, was noted in the port town of Kessin, Effi's destination. The society in Kessin, which was steeped in German ethnic nationalism, did not foster Effi's natural inclinations towards diversity and exoticism. Innstetten's mixed messages about Kessin initially seemed supportive, mentioning global trade connections, including those with China. However, the story about the Chinese man who died in Kessin significantly changed Effi's perception of other cultures, emphasizing the presence of a Chinese burial ground that Innstetten described as both intriguing and ominous.

文档显示，对亚洲竞争，特别是从快速工业化的东亚（1880年代）的担忧，加剧了欧洲人对跨种族竞争和焦虑。欧洲人对获取亚洲市场表现出兴趣，特别是通过关键港口。对于中国人，他们抵抗基督教，并被视为一个人口众多且种族独特的威胁，引起了关注。中国人的存在，尤其是通过提及中国的龙，被注意到Kessin港镇，Effi的目的地。Kessin社会，浸透着普鲁士时期的德国民族主义，没有鼓励Effi探索多样性和异国情调的自然倾向。Innstetten最初对Kessin的复杂信息看似支持，提到了全球贸易联系，包括与中国。然而，关于在Kessin去世的中国人故事显著改变了Effi对其他文化的看法，强调了一个中国人埋葬地的存在，Innstetten将其描述为既吸引人又令人不安的地方。
