[1] "The Russo- Turkish War and the Sino- Japanese War made headlines even in such journals as the Russian Russkij Vstnik and the German Deutsche Rundschau, both of which dealt as much with culture and literature as with politics."
[2] "Articles in Russkij Vstnik, the journal in which Leo Tolstoys Anna Karenina first appeared, not only condemned the Turks for their invasion of the Slavic world but also described them as belonging to an Asian tribe incapable of becoming truly civilized like the European peoples to which many Russians felt they belonged."
[3] "Effis affair with Crampas destroys her mar- riage, but against the background of the articles discussed above her long- term re- lationship with the Chinese ghost, whom she fears more as an actual Chinese man than as a bodiless spirit, communicates deeper anxieties about German- Asian re- lations."
