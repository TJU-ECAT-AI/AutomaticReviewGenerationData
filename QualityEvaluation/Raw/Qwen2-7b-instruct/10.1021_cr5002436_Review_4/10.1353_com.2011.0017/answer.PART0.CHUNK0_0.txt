[1] "The Russo- Turkish War and the Sino- Japanese War made headlines even in such journals as the Russian Russkij Vstnik and the German Deutsche Rundschau, both of which dealt as much with culture and literature as with politics."
[2] "Articles in Russkij Vstnik, the journal in which Leo Tolstoys Anna Karenina first appeared, not only condemned the Turks for their invasion of the Slavic world but also described them as belonging to an Asian tribe incapable of becoming truly civilized like the European peoples to which many Russians felt they belonged."
[3] "Effi hears about the Chinese man on the way to her new home in the port-town of Kessin in East Pommerania. Her husband tells her that the house they will share once was owned by a sea captain named Thomsen who had returned from business in Asia with a Chinese man as his servant."
[4] "When Effi moves into her home, the Chinese man returns as a ghost that haunts her bedroom."
[5] "Ironically, Innstettens various negative comments about Slavs achieve the opposite effect of his intentions, since Effi does not lose her interest in non-German peoples."
