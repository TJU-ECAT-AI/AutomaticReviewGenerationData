[1] "The Russo- Turkish War and the Sino- Japanese War made headlines even in such journals as the Russian Russkij Vstnik and the German Deutsche Rundschau, both of which dealt as much with culture and literature as with politics."
[2] "Articles in Russkij Vstnik, the journal in which Leo Tolstoys Anna Karenina first appeared, not only condemned the Turks for their invasion of the Slavic world but also described them as belonging to an Asian tribe incapable of becoming truly civilized like the European peoples to which many Russians felt they belonged."
[3] "In the same vein, articles in Deutsche Rundschau, the journal that first published Theodor Fontanes Effi Briest, not only reported on the Sino- Japanese War but also expressed German apprehensions about a growing power in Asia that might limit or even destroy European civilization."
[4] "Neither Anna Karenina nor Effi Briest were explicitly as anti- Asian as some of the articles in their respective journals, but both depicted Asians as outsidersif not outright barbarianswho threatened European order and against whom an alarm must be sounded."
