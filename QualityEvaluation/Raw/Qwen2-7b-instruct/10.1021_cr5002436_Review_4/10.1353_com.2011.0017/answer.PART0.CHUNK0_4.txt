The document reveals that European fears of Asian competition, particularly from the rapidly industrializing East Asia in the 1880s, contributed to a broader sense of inter-racial competition and anxiety. Europeans showed interest in securing access to Asian markets, particularly through strategic ports. Concerns about the Chinese, who resisted Christianity and were perceived as a racially distinct and populous threat, were also highlighted. The Chinese presence, especially through the mention of the Chinese dragon, was noted in the port town of Kessin, Effi's destination. The society in Kessin, which was steeped in German ethnic nationalism, did not foster Effi's natural inclinations towards diversity and exoticism. Innstetten's mixed messages about Kessin initially seemed supportive, mentioning global trade connections, including those with China. However, the story about the Chinese man who died in Kessin significantly changed Effi's perception of other cultures, emphasizing the presence of a Chinese burial ground that Innstetten described as both intriguing and ominous.
