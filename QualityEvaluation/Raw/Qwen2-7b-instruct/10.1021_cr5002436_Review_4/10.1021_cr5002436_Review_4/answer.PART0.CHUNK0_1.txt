Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms. Activated carbon, due to its high surface area, can catalyze a range of reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation. Specifically, VOx/Al2O3 catalysts encapsulated by coke deposits remain active in butane dehydrogenation, indicating that even complete encapsulation does not drastically reduce activity. The highest activity in carbon-based catalysts is often observed at temperatures where carbon deposits display a very ordered structure, suggesting that the arrangement of carbon atoms facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction. Radicals formed on the surface of coke are thought to play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) prove to be catalytically active, and the activity of hybrid nanocarbons containing diamond cores and graphitic shells is attributed to the presence of ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) show some activity in oxidative dehydrogenation, although conversion and selectivity are relatively low. Carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems demonstrate activity in propane dehydrogenation without the need for steam or oxidants. Silica-supported metal sulfides outperform their oxide counterparts in isobutane dehydrogenation. While Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 catalysts display similar activity and selectivity, they do not exclusively yield propylene but also larger aromatic molecules. Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst reduce to form metallic In particles under reaction conditions, believed to be the active species in dehydrogenation. Catalyst stability is notably enhanced by adding potassium to iron oxide catalysts, preventing reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and poisoning of acidic groups responsible for coke formation. DFT calculations suggest that the redox properties of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in ZSM-5 zeolites result in the formation of radical intermediates, contributing to the catalytic activity. Lastly, isolated Zn2+ species, whether deposited on a silica support or residing in the cation exchange sites of zeolites, are identified as active sites, showing a reaction mechanism akin to GaOx-based catalysts.

The implications of these findings are significant for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. The discovery of unexpected catalytic activity in carbon-based materials, especially at moderate temperatures and with controlled surface chemistry, opens avenues for creating more sustainable and economically viable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. The ability to tailor catalyst performance through the selection of materials and surface modifications could lead to improved selectivity, higher conversion rates, and prolonged catalyst lifetime, ultimately reducing costs and environmental impact in industrial processes. Moreover, the understanding of reaction mechanisms, such as the role of radicals and the importance of specific surface functionalities, provides insights for designing catalysts that can selectively produce desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This knowledge can be applied across various industries, including petrochemicals, refining, and energy sectors, to enhance efficiency and sustainability in the production of valuable chemicals and fuels.

各种碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和复合纳米碳，通过几种机制在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。由于其高比表面积，活化的碳可以催化一系列反应，包括烷烃脱氢。具体而言，完全被焦炭包覆的VOx/Al2O3催化剂在丁烷脱氢中保持活性，表明即使完全包覆也不会大幅度降低活性。碳基催化剂中观察到的最高活性通常是在碳沉积物显示非常有序结构时发生的温度下，这表明碳原子排列有助于脱氢过程。表面焦炭形成的自由基被认为是脱氢反应的关键。碳纳米纤维（CNF）证明具有催化活性，并且复合纳米碳包含钻石核心和石墨烯壳体的材料的活性归因于石墨烯材料中的酮基团或结构缺陷的存在。氮掺杂的碳纳米管（CNT）在丙烷氧化脱氢中显示出一些活性，但转化率和选择性相对较低。基于有序微孔结构的碳基系统在没有蒸汽或氧化剂的情况下显示出丙烷脱氢的活性。硅酸盐支持的金属硫化物在异丁烷脱氢中表现优于其氧化物。然而，镓/和铟负载的ZSM-5催化剂不仅不专一地产生丙烯，还会产生更大的芳香分子。小尺寸的In2O3簇在催化剂表面在反应条件下还原为金属In颗粒，被认为是脱氢作用的活性物种。向铁氧化物催化剂中添加钾显著提高了稳定性，防止Fe2O3还原为Fe3O4并阻止产生导致焦炭形成的关键酸性基团。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，ZSM-5沸石中的Fe2+和Fe3+的氧化还原性质导致形成了自由基中间体，从而促进催化活性。最后，无论是沉积在二氧化硅支持上还是存在于沸石的阳离子交换位点上的孤立Zn2+物种都被确认为活性位点，显示了与GaOx催化剂类似的作用机制。

这些发现对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。碳基材料中意外的催化活性的发现，特别是在适中的温度和可控的表面化学下，开辟了创造更加可持续和经济可行的催化剂的可能性，用于烷烃脱氢。通过选择材料和表面修饰来调整催化剂性能的能力，可以提高选择性、提高转化率，并延长催化剂寿命，最终减少成本和环境影响，应用于工业过程。此外，对于反应机制的理解，如自由基的作用以及特定表面功能的重要性，提供了设计能够选择性生产所需产品而最小化副反应的催化剂的见解。这种知识可以在各个行业应用，包括石油化学、精炼和能源领域，以提高效率和可持续性，在生产有价值的化学品和燃料的过程中。
