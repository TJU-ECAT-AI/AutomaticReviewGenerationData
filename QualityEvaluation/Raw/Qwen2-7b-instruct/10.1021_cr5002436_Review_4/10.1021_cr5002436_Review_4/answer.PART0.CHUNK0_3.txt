Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms. Coke deposits, when completely encapsulated by a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, maintain their activity, suggesting that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface catalyze the reaction. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and hybrid nanocarbons, when tested under similar conditions, prove to be catalytically active, indicating that radicals formed on their surfaces facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (CO) on carbon-based catalysts, formed during pretreatment with nitric acid, is proposed to be an active site. Some metal carbides and nitrides, such as molybdenum, vanadium, and tungsten, show activity in both dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, displaying specific activities similar to a commercial PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, some materials, like niobium carbide and nitride, do not exhibit any activity. The introduction of iron oxide in indium-based catalysts enhances activity through redox properties that result in the formation of radical intermediates. Zinc titanate, when prepared as a mixed oxide or as isolated Zn2+ species deposited on a silica support, is also found to be active in propane dehydrogenation, with the active sites being coordinatively unsaturated Zn2+ Lewis acid sites.

Temperature plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, as observed in the case of CNFs where activity is highest at 700°C, correlating with the very ordered structure of the carbon deposits at this temperature. Surface chemistry, including the presence of specific functional groups, is another key factor in determining the catalytic activity of these materials. The incorporation of metals, such as iron and zinc, in the framework of zeolites or as isolated species, enhances activity through redox cycles or by withdrawing electrons from metal sites, enhancing acidity and improving activity. The development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts is influenced by understanding the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, which could lead to the creation of catalysts with improved selectivity, stability, and efficiency.

各种碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳，通过几种机制在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性。当完全被VOx/Al2O3催化剂包覆时，焦炭沉积物能够保持其活性，表明表面形成的碳物种能够催化反应。碳纳米纤维（CNF）和混合纳米碳，在相似条件下进行测试时，证明具有催化活性，表明其表面形成的自由基促进了脱氢反应。碳基催化剂上存在的氧含团（CO），在硝酸预处理步骤中形成，被提议为活性位点。一些金属碳化物和氮化物，如钼、钒和钨，显示在脱氢和氢解两个过程中的活性，显示出与商用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂相似的特定活性。然而，某些材料，如铌碳化物和氮化物，并不表现出任何活性。在铟基催化剂中引入铁氧化物增强了活性，通过氧化还原性质导致形成了自由基中间体。锌钛酸盐，以水凝胶或混合氧化物的形式制备，或者在二氧化硅支持上沉积孤立的Zn2+物种，也被发现是丙烷脱氢的活性物质，活性位点被认为是三元硅氧环上的未配位Zn2+Lewis酸位点。温度对催化活性至关重要，CNF在700°C时的最高活性与碳沉积物在此温度下的非常有序结构相关联。表面化学，包括特定功能基的存在，是决定这些材料催化活性的关键因素。在框架型沸石中或作为孤立的Zn2+物种沉积在二氧化硅支持上，金属（如铁和锌）的引入增强了活性，通过氧化还原循环或通过从金属位点抽出电子，增强酸性和提高活性。通过理解这些现象背后的机制来发展新型和高效的碳基催化剂，可能有助于创造具有改进选择性、稳定性和效率的催化剂。
