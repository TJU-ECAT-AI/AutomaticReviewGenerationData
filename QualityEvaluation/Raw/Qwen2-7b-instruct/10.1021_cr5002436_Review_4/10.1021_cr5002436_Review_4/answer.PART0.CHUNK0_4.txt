4.6 Carbon-Based Catalysts
"Moreover, discrete functionalities of activated carbon can catalyze an array of reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation."
"In view of this, the authors decided to test their hypothesis by using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a catalyst under similar conditions. Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active."
"Hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."
"In previous work, CNFs had been shown to be active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane, although in this case surface oxygen groups were believed to be the active sites."
"Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. (254)"

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Coke deposits, despite complete encapsulation by carbon, retained catalytic activity, suggesting the role of surface species. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) proved active, attributing their catalytic power to surface oxygen groups in oxidative dehydrogenation scenarios. Hybrid nanocarbons, featuring a diamond core and a graphitic shell, showed activity due to ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material. Liu et al.'s work demonstrated the effectiveness of ordered mesoporous carbon in dehydrogenating propane without additional oxidants or steam, highlighting the potential of carbon-based catalysts for efficient alkane dehydrogenation.
