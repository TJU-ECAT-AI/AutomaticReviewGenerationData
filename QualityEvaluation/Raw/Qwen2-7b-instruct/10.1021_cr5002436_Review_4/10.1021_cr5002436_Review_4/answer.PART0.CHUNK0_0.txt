[1] "Carbon materials have been tested as the support in catalysts employed for various reactions, mostly because of their high surface area and the fact that these materials are both inexpensive and environmentally friendly."
[2] "The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."
[3] "In previous work, CNFs had been shown to be active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane, although in this case surface oxygen groups were believed to be the active sites."
[4] "Furthermore, nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) showed some activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, although conversion and selectivity were relatively low."
[5] "The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."
[6] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction."
[7] "It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."
[8] "However, elevated temperatures also lead to a drop in selectivity, as cracking becomes the dominant reaction."
[9] "Interestingly, the latter was not the case in the work of McGregor et al., who reported a selectivity toward butenes of 80%."
[10] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms. 

1. **Carbon Nanofibers (CNFs)**: CNFs proved to be catalytically active in alkane dehydrogenation, suggesting that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the reaction. However, at elevated temperatures, noncatalytic conversion of propane increases, leading to a drop in selectivity. Notably, CNFs showed a high selectivity toward butenes of 80% in the work of McGregor et al.

2. **Hybrid Nanocarbons**: These materials, characterized by a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity in alkane dehydrogenation, attributed to the presence of ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material.

3. **Coke Deposits**: Complete encapsulation of a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst by coke deposits did not drastically decrease its activity, indicating that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were likely catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. **Surface Chemistry and Temperature Influence**: The catalytic activity of carbon-based catalysts peaks at specific temperatures, such as 700°C, where the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure. Surface oxygen groups on CNFs and nitrogen doping on CNTs contributed to the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. **Oxygen-Containing Groups**: Pretreatment steps involving nitric acid led to the formation of oxygen-containing groups (CO) on the catalyst surface, proposed as active sites in alkane dehydrogenation.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts include the potential for creating catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity by manipulating surface chemistry and optimizing operating conditions. Understanding the specific mechanisms underlying the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials can guide the design of more effective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation and other chemical processes.

碳基材料在多种反应中作为催化剂的支撑物被测试，主要是因为它们具有高表面积、成本低廉且环保。在烷烃脱氢反应中，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳在内的各种碳基材料表现出令人意外的催化活性，其机制如下：

1. **碳纳米纤维（CNF）**：CNF已被证明在烷烃脱氢反应中具有催化活性，表明焦炭表面形成的自由基促进了反应。然而，在较高温度下，丙烷的非催化转化增加，导致选择性下降。McGregor等人的一项工作报告了CNF对丁烯的选择性高达80%。

2. **混合纳米碳**：这种材料由钻石核心和石墨壳组成，显示了丙烷脱氢的活性，归因于石墨材料中存在的酮基团或结构缺陷。

3. **焦炭沉积物**：完全包覆VOx/Al2O3催化剂的焦炭沉积物并未显著降低其活性，这表明催化剂表面上形成的碳物种实际上正在催化脱氢反应。

4. **表面化学与温度影响**：碳基催化剂的催化活性在特定温度（如700°C）达到峰值，此时碳沉积物显示出非常有序的结构。CNF表面的氧基团和CNT中的氮掺杂对氧化脱氢具有贡献。

5. **含有氧基团**：通过硝酸预处理步骤，表面形成了氧基团（CO），被认为是在烷烃脱氢过程中作为活性位点的催化剂表面。

这一现象对于开发新型高效碳基催化剂的潜在影响包括通过调整表面化学和优化操作条件来提高活性和选择性的潜力。理解碳基材料催化活性的具体机制可以指导设计更有效的催化剂用于烷烃脱氢和其他化学过程。
