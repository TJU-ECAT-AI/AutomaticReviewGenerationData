[1] "The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets."
[2] "Rather, in this decade, Asia has witnessed cycles of marked credit card lending booms and busts in a number of its markets."
[3] "These three Asian episodes of credit card lending booms and busts share several common elements in terms of their approximate causes, symptoms, dynamics and consequences: intensified competition in the high-yield, less prime, credit card lending business leading to reduced lending standards; a rapid build-up in household indebtedness; a disproportionate concentration of debt burdens among riskier cardholders; a significant and sudden deterioration of asset quality; and a subsequent prolonged contraction in credit card receivables."
[4] "As a consequence, there was a tendency of disproportional concentration of debt burdens among the less creditworthy card borrowers who need unsecured lending the most."
[5] "Moreover, as commonly happens with the boom of credit to households, aggregate spending received a boost as well."
[6] "Tighter credit in turn further pushed up delinquencies, especially among overleveraged borrowers."
[7] "In each case, as the situation worsened, policy interventions shifted more towards crisis management, often in the forms of regulatory forbearance for issuers and debt rehabilitation for overleveraged cardholders."
[8] "The cleaning-up processes in the three episodes all witnessed protracted contraction in credit card receivables and heavy losses suffered by card issuers but differed in the role of the government."
[9] "The unwinding of the earlier excess lending sometimes also intertwined with and even exacerbated ongoing local business down cycles."
[10] "Finally, rising delinquencies impacted the real economies via weakened consumer spending."
[11] "Moreover, commercial banks themselves were heavily exposed to monoline credit card issuers."

The document discusses the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This activity is attributed to their unique properties such as high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and controlled surface chemistry. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of alkane molecules through adsorption on the catalyst surfaces, followed by the breaking of C-H bonds under elevated temperatures. The surface chemistry plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. Temperature is a significant influencing factor, as it affects the reaction kinetics and the stability of the catalyst. The implications of this phenomenon are profound, as it suggests the potential for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for various industrial applications, including petrochemical processing and energy conversion. These catalysts could offer advantages over traditional metal-based catalysts, such as lower cost, higher sustainability, and potential for tailoring chemical functionalities.
