Against a background of the excessive US household indebtedness and ongoing global financial turmoil, consumer credit in Asia has grown significantly in recent years. While housing finance has dominated the lending to households and thus received the bulk of attention, unsecured personal lending has also expanded rapidly, albeit from a relatively low basis. With rising affluence, banks more oriented to the apparent higher risk-adjusted returns on household lending, and policymakers strategy to pursue more domestic demand-driven growth, the credit card business has been one of the fastest-growing areas of unsecured retail finance in many Asian markets. Expanding credit card markets improve access to credit by a broader portion of the population and represent a more important source of profits for banks and other lenders. They may also affect the transmission of monetary policy and pose new challenges to financial stability.

The rapid growth of consumer credit in Asia, particularly in the credit card sector, is attributed to several factors. These include the pursuit of higher risk-adjusted returns on household lending, the aim to stimulate domestic demand-driven growth, and the increasing affluence of populations in Asian markets. As a result, credit card businesses have emerged as one of the fastest-growing areas of unsecured retail finance. This expansion enhances access to credit for a larger portion of the population and provides a significant source of profits for banks and other lenders. However, it also poses new challenges to financial stability.

亚洲消费者信贷的快速增长，特别是信用卡领域，归因于几个因素。这些包括追求更高的家庭贷款风险调整回报、刺激国内需求驱动增长以及亚洲市场人口的日益富裕。因此，信用卡业务已成为无担保零售金融领域增长最快的领域之一。这种扩张增强了广大人口的信贷获取渠道，并为银行和其他贷款机构提供了重要的利润来源。然而，这也对金融稳定提出了新的挑战。
