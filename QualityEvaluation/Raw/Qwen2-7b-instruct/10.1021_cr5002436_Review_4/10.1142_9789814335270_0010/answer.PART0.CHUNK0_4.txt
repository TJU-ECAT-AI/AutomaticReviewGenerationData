[1] "The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets.
Rather, in this decade, Asia has witnessed cycles of marked credit card lending booms and busts in a number of its markets."
[2] "The boom phase was typically characterized by large increases in credit card lending and credit availability."
[3] "Six factors lay behind the relaxation of lending standards and excessive growth in credit card lending."
[4] "The season- ing effect appears to be similar to that of corporate high-yield bonds,which tend to have low default rates in the years immediately after their issuance with their positive cash flows."
[5] "In Korea, cash advance fees and interest charges exceeded 20% compared to the prevailing unsecured personal loan rates of 67%."
[6] "As a consequence, there was a tendency of disproportional concentration of debt burdens among the less creditworthy card borrowers who need unsecured lending the most."
[7] "In Korea, a leading local issuer found that 70% of its bad loans came from card lending extended to accounts acquired during 20002001, when the total number of credit cards in the economy more than doubled."
[8] "In each case, as the situation worsened, policy interventions shifted more towards crisis management, often in the forms of regulatory forbearance for issuers and debt rehabilitation for overleveraged cardholders."
[9] "In sum, our findings confirm the central role of excessive cash lending in the Korean credit card crisis."

The document does not provide specific details on the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. It discusses the growth and lending cycles of credit card markets in Asia, particularly focusing on Korea, and the factors contributing to these cycles. It mentions that the boom phase is characterized by large increases in credit card lending, relaxed lending standards, and excessive growth. The document also notes that cash advance fees and interest charges in Korea were notably higher than unsecured personal loan rates. It describes how there was a disproportionate concentration of debt burdens among less creditworthy card borrowers, leading to increased risks in credit card lending portfolios. The document further explains that as the lending cycle turns, tight credit, higher delinquencies, and regulatory interventions are common outcomes. It confirms that excessive cash lending played a central role in the Korean credit card crisis.

The document provides no direct information on the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions or the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors, and implications of this phenomenon. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question based on the provided text.
