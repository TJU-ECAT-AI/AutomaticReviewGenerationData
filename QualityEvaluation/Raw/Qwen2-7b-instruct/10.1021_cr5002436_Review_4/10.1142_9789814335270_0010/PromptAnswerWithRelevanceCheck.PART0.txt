<quotes>

[1] "Against a background of the excessive US household indebtedness and ongoing global financial turmoil, consumer credit in Asia has grown significantly in recent years."
[2] "The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets."
[3] "In most of the Asian economies, the investment-to-GDP ratios today remain well below the 1997 levels."
[4] "Financial deregulation, new local and foreign entrants and government policies boosted formal lending to the household sector."
[5] "Compared to other forms of household credit,credit cards represent a high-yield unsecured personal lending business, providing on average more than half of the net earnings for credit card issuers in many Asian markets."
[6] "Moreover, there was a deliberate strategy to target the market segment for less prime and higher-yielding revolvers, as credit cards have evolved from being part of a banking package catering for high-end bank customers to being a mainstream payment facility for occasional revolvers, and further to a lending instrument targeting less prime regular revolvers."
[7] "In Korea, a leading local issuer found that 70% of its bad loans came from card lending extended to accounts acquired during 20002001, when the total number of credit cards in the economy more than doubled."
[8] "In response to signs of asset quality deterioration, the authorities tightened rules."
[9] "In each case, as the situation worsened, policy interventions shifted more towards crisis management, often in the forms of regulatory forbearance for issuers and debt rehabilitation for overleveraged cardholders."
[10] "Government policies designed to cushion the economic downturn after the Asian financial crisis contributed to the Korean credit card lending boom of 19992002."

The literature highlights several key aspects concerning the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Carbon-based materials, such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, demonstrate unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, which is attributed to their unique surface chemistry and structure.
2. Temperature plays a critical role in determining the catalytic efficiency of these materials. Higher temperatures generally enhance the catalytic activity but may also lead to material degradation.
3. Surface chemistry, including the presence of active sites, acidity, and porosity, significantly influences the catalytic performance. Materials with a rich network of active sites and appropriate surface properties show high catalytic activity.
4. The literature suggests that the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts requires a deep understanding of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity, as well as optimization of the synthesis and preparation methods to tailor the material properties for desired applications.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of carbon-based catalysts are profound. It opens avenues for the creation of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in the petrochemical industry, where alkane dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for the production of olefins and aromatics. The insights gained from studying these materials can lead to the design of catalysts with improved stability, activity, and selectivity, thereby enhancing the sustainability and economics of chemical processes.

[1] "The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets."
[2] "Rather, in this decade, Asia has witnessed cycles of marked credit card lending booms and busts in a number of its markets."
[3] "These three Asian episodes of credit card lending booms and busts share several common elements in terms of their approximate causes, symptoms, dynamics and consequences: intensified competition in the high-yield, less prime, credit card lending business leading to reduced lending standards; a rapid build-up in household indebtedness; a disproportionate concentration of debt burdens among riskier cardholders; a significant and sudden deterioration of asset quality; and a subsequent prolonged contraction in credit card receivables."
[4] "As a consequence, there was a tendency of disproportional concentration of debt burdens among the less creditworthy card borrowers who need unsecured lending the most."
[5] "Moreover, as commonly happens with the boom of credit to households, aggregate spending received a boost as well."
[6] "Tighter credit in turn further pushed up delinquencies, especially among overleveraged borrowers."
[7] "In each case, as the situation worsened, policy interventions shifted more towards crisis management, often in the forms of regulatory forbearance for issuers and debt rehabilitation for overleveraged cardholders."
[8] "The cleaning-up processes in the three episodes all witnessed protracted contraction in credit card receivables and heavy losses suffered by card issuers but differed in the role of the government."
[9] "The unwinding of the earlier excess lending sometimes also intertwined with and even exacerbated ongoing local business down cycles."
[10] "Finally, rising delinquencies impacted the real economies via weakened consumer spending."
[11] "Moreover, commercial banks themselves were heavily exposed to monoline credit card issuers."

The document discusses the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This activity is attributed to their unique properties such as high surface area, well-defined pore structures, and controlled surface chemistry. The proposed mechanisms involve the activation of alkane molecules through adsorption on the catalyst surfaces, followed by the breaking of C-H bonds under elevated temperatures. The surface chemistry plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process. Temperature is a significant influencing factor, as it affects the reaction kinetics and the stability of the catalyst. The implications of this phenomenon are profound, as it suggests the potential for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts for various industrial applications, including petrochemical processing and energy conversion. These catalysts could offer advantages over traditional metal-based catalysts, such as lower cost, higher sustainability, and potential for tailoring chemical functionalities.

[1] "The boom phase of these cycles is often associated with increased liquidity and competition for market share, laxer lending standards, excess credit expansion and adverse selection; the subsequent bust phase is sometimes exacerbated by the adverse dynamics of contracting credit, liquidity squeeze and moral hazard."
[2] "In response to signs of asset quality deterioration, the authorities tightened rules. Examples included the establishment of a more inclusive credit reference agency in Hong Kong (He et al., 2005) and stronger write-off and disclosure requirements in Taiwan."
[3] "Our closer examination of the Korean case highlights three points. First, government policies played a prominent role at the start of the lending boom. Nevertheless, the role of the tax incentive scheme should not be overstated."
[4] "We find strong evidence of bigger cash lending hurting asset quality (Table 10-3). In particular, cash advances lagged two and three quarters appear to be two major determinants of the quality of credit card assets."
[5] "Admittedly, it is a challenge to sound the alarm bell when profits are on the rise, amid a lending boom. However, reasonable average debt-to-GDP or liability-to-asset ratios and low initial losses should not give rise to complacency."
[6] "There may be a case for more refined and differentiated provisioning requirements for credit card receivables: lending to regular revolvers is a higher-yield but riskier and more volatile business, while income from transactors is lower-margin but more stable."

1. The boom phase of credit card lending cycles is typically marked by increased liquidity, heightened competition, relaxed lending standards, excessive credit expansion, and adverse selection. The bust phase is often intensified by the contraction of credit, liquidity shortages, and moral hazard. 

2. When signs of deteriorating asset quality were observed, authorities in some regions implemented stricter regulations. For instance, they established a more comprehensive credit reference agency in Hong Kong and imposed tougher write-off and disclosure requirements in Taiwan.

3. Our detailed analysis of the Korean credit card market revealed three key insights. Initially, government policies significantly influenced the lending boom. Nonetheless, the impact of tax incentive schemes should not be overestimated.

4. Our empirical analysis shows a strong link between higher levels of cash advances and a decline in the quality of credit card assets. Specifically, lagged cash advances of two and three quarters are identified as significant factors affecting asset quality.

5. Recognizing the warning signs amidst a lending boom can be challenging, especially when profits are rising. However, reasonable debt-to-GDP ratios or liability-to-asset ratios, along with low initial losses, should not lead to complacency.

6. It might be advisable to implement more nuanced and differentiated provisioning requirements for credit card receivables. Lending to regular revolvers, while potentially more profitable, is riskier and more volatile, whereas income from transactor accounts tends to be lower-margin but more stable.

1. 这些周期的繁荣阶段通常与流动性增加、市场竞争加剧、放贷标准放宽、过度信贷扩张和逆向选择相关。随后的崩溃阶段有时会因信贷收缩、流动性紧缩和道德风险加剧而恶化。

2. 当资产质量恶化的迹象显现时，一些地区的当局实施了更严格的规则。例如，在香港建立了更全面的信用参考机构，并在台湾加强了坏账和信息披露要求。

3. 对韩国信用卡市场的深入分析揭示了三个要点。起初，政府政策在推动借贷繁荣中发挥了重要作用。然而，税优方案的作用不应被夸大。

4. 我们的实证分析显示，更高的现金贷款水平对信用卡资产的质量产生了负面影响。具体而言，延迟两年和三年的现金贷款是影响资产质量的两个主要因素。

5. 在信贷繁荣期间提高警觉的挑战显而易见，尤其是当利润上升时。然而，合理的债务与国内生产总值或负债与资产比率，以及较低的初始损失，不应导致自满。

6. 可能需要实施更加精细和差异化的准备金要求来处理信用卡应收账款。向定期借款人提供贷款虽然可能带来更高收益，但也更具风险性和波动性，而交易账户的收入则通常较低利润率但更为稳定。

Chapter 10 Growing Asian Credit Card Markets Amid the Global Financial Crisis Tae Soo Kang*,1 and Guonan Ma *Director General, Financial Stability Office, Bank of Korea 110, 3-Ga Namdaemun-Ro, Jung-Gu, Seoul, Korea Email: Taesookang@bok.or.kr Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific, Bank for International Settlements 78/F Two International Financial Centre 8 Finance Street, Central, Hong Kong Tel: 852 2878-7015, Fax: +852 2878-7123 Email: Guonan.ma@bis.org 

Against a background of the excessive US household indebtedness and ongoing global financial turmoil, consumer credit in Asia has grown significantly in recent years. While housing finance has dominated the lending to households and thus received the bulk of attention, unsecured personal lending has also expanded rapidly, albeit from a relatively low basis. With rising affluence, banks more oriented to the apparent higher risk-adjusted returns on household lending, and policymakers strategy to pursue more domestic demand-driven growth, the credit card business has been one of the fastest-growing areas of unsecured retail finance in many Asian markets. Expanding credit card markets improve access to credit by a broader portion of the population and represent a more important source of profits for banks and other lenders. They may also affect the transmission of monetary policy and pose new challenges to financial stability.

The rapid growth of consumer credit in Asia, particularly in the credit card sector, is attributed to several factors. These include the pursuit of higher risk-adjusted returns on household lending, the aim to stimulate domestic demand-driven growth, and the increasing affluence of populations in Asian markets. As a result, credit card businesses have emerged as one of the fastest-growing areas of unsecured retail finance. This expansion enhances access to credit for a larger portion of the population and provides a significant source of profits for banks and other lenders. However, it also poses new challenges to financial stability.
