[1] "Against a background of the excessive US household indebtedness and ongoing global financial turmoil, consumer credit in Asia has grown significantly in recent years."
[2] "The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets."
[3] "In most of the Asian economies, the investment-to-GDP ratios today remain well below the 1997 levels."
[4] "Financial deregulation, new local and foreign entrants and government policies boosted formal lending to the household sector."
[5] "Compared to other forms of household credit,credit cards represent a high-yield unsecured personal lending business, providing on average more than half of the net earnings for credit card issuers in many Asian markets."
[6] "Moreover, there was a deliberate strategy to target the market segment for less prime and higher-yielding revolvers, as credit cards have evolved from being part of a banking package catering for high-end bank customers to being a mainstream payment facility for occasional revolvers, and further to a lending instrument targeting less prime regular revolvers."
[7] "In Korea, a leading local issuer found that 70% of its bad loans came from card lending extended to accounts acquired during 20002001, when the total number of credit cards in the economy more than doubled."
[8] "In response to signs of asset quality deterioration, the authorities tightened rules."
[9] "In each case, as the situation worsened, policy interventions shifted more towards crisis management, often in the forms of regulatory forbearance for issuers and debt rehabilitation for overleveraged cardholders."
[10] "Government policies designed to cushion the economic downturn after the Asian financial crisis contributed to the Korean credit card lending boom of 19992002."

The literature highlights several key aspects concerning the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Carbon-based materials, such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, demonstrate unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, which is attributed to their unique surface chemistry and structure.
2. Temperature plays a critical role in determining the catalytic efficiency of these materials. Higher temperatures generally enhance the catalytic activity but may also lead to material degradation.
3. Surface chemistry, including the presence of active sites, acidity, and porosity, significantly influences the catalytic performance. Materials with a rich network of active sites and appropriate surface properties show high catalytic activity.
4. The literature suggests that the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts requires a deep understanding of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity, as well as optimization of the synthesis and preparation methods to tailor the material properties for desired applications.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of carbon-based catalysts are profound. It opens avenues for the creation of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in the petrochemical industry, where alkane dehydrogenation reactions are crucial for the production of olefins and aromatics. The insights gained from studying these materials can lead to the design of catalysts with improved stability, activity, and selectivity, thereby enhancing the sustainability and economics of chemical processes.
