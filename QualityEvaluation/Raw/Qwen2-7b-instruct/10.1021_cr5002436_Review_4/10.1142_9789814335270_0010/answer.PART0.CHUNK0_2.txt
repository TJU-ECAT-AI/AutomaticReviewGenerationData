[1] "The boom phase of these cycles is often associated with increased liquidity and competition for market share, laxer lending standards, excess credit expansion and adverse selection; the subsequent bust phase is sometimes exacerbated by the adverse dynamics of contracting credit, liquidity squeeze and moral hazard."
[2] "In response to signs of asset quality deterioration, the authorities tightened rules. Examples included the establishment of a more inclusive credit reference agency in Hong Kong (He et al., 2005) and stronger write-off and disclosure requirements in Taiwan."
[3] "Our closer examination of the Korean case highlights three points. First, government policies played a prominent role at the start of the lending boom. Nevertheless, the role of the tax incentive scheme should not be overstated."
[4] "We find strong evidence of bigger cash lending hurting asset quality (Table 10-3). In particular, cash advances lagged two and three quarters appear to be two major determinants of the quality of credit card assets."
[5] "Admittedly, it is a challenge to sound the alarm bell when profits are on the rise, amid a lending boom. However, reasonable average debt-to-GDP or liability-to-asset ratios and low initial losses should not give rise to complacency."
[6] "There may be a case for more refined and differentiated provisioning requirements for credit card receivables: lending to regular revolvers is a higher-yield but riskier and more volatile business, while income from transactors is lower-margin but more stable."

1. The boom phase of credit card lending cycles is typically marked by increased liquidity, heightened competition, relaxed lending standards, excessive credit expansion, and adverse selection. The bust phase is often intensified by the contraction of credit, liquidity shortages, and moral hazard. 

2. When signs of deteriorating asset quality were observed, authorities in some regions implemented stricter regulations. For instance, they established a more comprehensive credit reference agency in Hong Kong and imposed tougher write-off and disclosure requirements in Taiwan.

3. Our detailed analysis of the Korean credit card market revealed three key insights. Initially, government policies significantly influenced the lending boom. Nonetheless, the impact of tax incentive schemes should not be overestimated.

4. Our empirical analysis shows a strong link between higher levels of cash advances and a decline in the quality of credit card assets. Specifically, lagged cash advances of two and three quarters are identified as significant factors affecting asset quality.

5. Recognizing the warning signs amidst a lending boom can be challenging, especially when profits are rising. However, reasonable debt-to-GDP ratios or liability-to-asset ratios, along with low initial losses, should not lead to complacency.

6. It might be advisable to implement more nuanced and differentiated provisioning requirements for credit card receivables. Lending to regular revolvers, while potentially more profitable, is riskier and more volatile, whereas income from transactor accounts tends to be lower-margin but more stable.

1. 这些周期的繁荣阶段通常与流动性增加、市场竞争加剧、放贷标准放宽、过度信贷扩张和逆向选择相关。随后的崩溃阶段有时会因信贷收缩、流动性紧缩和道德风险加剧而恶化。

2. 当资产质量恶化的迹象显现时，一些地区的当局实施了更严格的规则。例如，在香港建立了更全面的信用参考机构，并在台湾加强了坏账和信息披露要求。

3. 对韩国信用卡市场的深入分析揭示了三个要点。起初，政府政策在推动借贷繁荣中发挥了重要作用。然而，税优方案的作用不应被夸大。

4. 我们的实证分析显示，更高的现金贷款水平对信用卡资产的质量产生了负面影响。具体而言，延迟两年和三年的现金贷款是影响资产质量的两个主要因素。

5. 在信贷繁荣期间提高警觉的挑战显而易见，尤其是当利润上升时。然而，合理的债务与国内生产总值或负债与资产比率，以及较低的初始损失，不应导致自满。

6. 可能需要实施更加精细和差异化的准备金要求来处理信用卡应收账款。向定期借款人提供贷款虽然可能带来更高收益，但也更具风险性和波动性，而交易账户的收入则通常较低利润率但更为稳定。
