The free surface area of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide has been deter- mined using selective oxygen chemisorption at room temperature. The oxygen chemisorption experiments were performed on reduced catalysts. It has appeared to be essential that the iron oxide phase, which is present as MgFe204 in the fresh calcined catalysts, is reduced uniquely to FeO, prior to the chemisorption experiment. Crystatlite sizes typically in the range of 20-23 nm have been found independent of the catalyst loading and the type of precursors. A higher iron loading does not lead to larger crystallites, but rather to more crystallites of about the same average size.

The free surface area of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide was assessed using selective oxygen chemisorption at room temperature. Essential to the process is the unique reduction of the iron oxide phase from MgFe2O4 to FeO prior to the chemisorption experiment. Typically, crystallite sizes around 20-23 nm were observed, irrespective of the catalyst loading or precursor type. Higher iron loadings do not result in larger crystallites but rather more of the same-sized crystallites.

铁氧化物催化剂在镁氧化物上的自由表面积通过室温选择性氧化学吸附进行了评估。在化学吸附实验之前，铁氧化物相从MgFe2O4独特地还原为FeO是至关重要的。通常观察到的晶粒大小约为20-23nm，无论催化剂负载或前体类型如何。更高的铁负载不会导致更大的晶粒，而是更多的相同大小的晶粒。

From the magnetization measurements it can be concluded that during the surface oxidation at 293 K the FeO phase at the surface is rapidly oxidized to -Fe/O3. This confirms earlier observations that FeO is not homogeneously dissolved in the MgO phase but is concentrated at the surface of the particles.

从磁化测量结果来看，在293 K下的表面氧化过程中，表面的FeO相迅速氧化为-Fe/O3。这证实了之前的观察结果，即FeO不是均匀溶解在MgO相中，而是集中在粒子表面。

Selective oxygen chemisorption is an excellent technique for the determination of the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magnesium oxide. It is applicable to many other catalyst systems. The prerequisite, however, remains that oxidation of the surface proceeds at much higher rate than that of the bulk. The results also depend on the ability to convert the metal oxide reliably and completely into a known lower oxidation state.

Selective oxygen chemisorption is an outstanding method for determining the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magnesium oxide. It is suitable for numerous other catalyst systems. However, the key prerequisite is that surface oxidation occurs at a significantly faster rate than bulk oxidation. Additionally, the ability to reliably and completely convert the metal oxide to a known lower oxidation state is crucial for obtaining accurate results.

选择性氧化学吸附是确定镁铁石催化剂在镁氧化物支持下活性表面积的有效技术。它适用于许多其他催化剂系统。然而，关键的前提条件是表面氧化速率远高于基体氧化速率。此外，可靠且完全地将金属氧化物转换为已知的较低氧化状态的能力对于获得准确的结果至关重要。
