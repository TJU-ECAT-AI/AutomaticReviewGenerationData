Department of Inorganic Chemistry, State University of Utrecht, PO Box 80083, 3508 TB, Utrecht, The Netherlands The free surface area of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide has been deter- mined using selective oxygen chemisorption at room temperature. The oxygen chemisorption experiments were performed on reduced catalysts. It has appeared to be essential that the iron oxide phase, which is present as MgFe204 in the fresh calcined catalysts, is reduced uniquely to FeO, prior to the chemisorption experiment. Crystatlite sizes typically in the range of 20-23 nm have been found independent of the catalyst loading and the type of precursors. A higher iron loading does not lead to larger crystallites, but rather to more crystallites of about the same average size. Results are in very good agreement with those obtained by X-ray line broadening and electron microscopy.
Introduction It is of great interest to determine the free surface area of the active component of a supported catalyst, since it allows one to determine the catalytic conversion per unit of surface area. A very direct approach to obtain the free active surface area is applying selective chemi- sorption techniques. A simple nitrogen Brunauer- Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement would not satisfy,since it provides the total surface area including the contribution of the support. Selective chemisorption techniques, especially with hydrogen and carbon mon- oxide, are frequently used for the characterization of supported metal catalysts. Comparable procedures for supported metal oxide catalysts are scarce, since com- mon probe molecules, such as, hydrogen, carbon mon- oxide, and nitrogen oxide generally do not exhibit simple chemisorption or decomposition with oxidic catalysts [1]. To solve this problem by completely reducing the oxidic active phase to the corresponding metal would lead to great inaccuracies, because of the introduction of effects, such as, sintering.
An alternative procedure, namely, selective chemi- sorption of oxygen onto partially reduced oxide cata- lysts, however, has proven to be fairly accurate. This method has been applied on supported V20 5 catalysts by van DiUen [2]. Weller has reviewed results of oxygen chemisorption on supported and unsupported Cr203 and MoO2 catalysts [3]. Van der Wal [4] and van de Berg et al. [5] have adsorbed oxygen selectively onto supported and unsupported -Fe203 catalysts,respectively. In this paper we will discuss oxygen chemisorption onto iron oxide dehydrogenation cata- 0022-2461/92 $03.00 + .12 9 1992 Chapman & Hall lysts supported on magnesium oxide. Previous studies have shown that the iron oxide phase in these catalysts is present as finely divided magnesium ferrite, MgFe204, on the magnesium oxide support [6].
Some oxides, such as, V2Os, and Fe20 3, do not chemisorb oxygen to the extent of about a monolayer,since sorption of oxygen has to be accompanied by a charge transfer from the catalyst to the oxygen [2, 4].
To endow the surface with the ability to adsorb oxygen, the oxide will have to be reduced to a lower oxidation state. The active surface area is sub- sequently determined by re-oxidizing the surface by admitting oxygen pulses to the catalyst. A prerequisite is that oxygen sorption is carried out at temperatures where surface oxidation proceeds rather rapidly and bulk oxidation is slow or even inhibited. Then, if pulses of oxygen are admitted to the reduced catalyst,the time required to take up one dose rises appreciably when surface oxidation changes into bulk oxidation.
Since surface oxidation is probably not limited to the first monolayer, the amount of oxygen adsorbed cannot be directly related to the active oxidic surface area. Therefore, the method will have to be calibrated.
This can be done by independently determining the surface area of unsupported magnesium ferrite by nitrogen adsorption using the BET method. The amount of oxygen required to oxidize the surface of partially reduced unsupported magnesium ferrite can be used to determine the surface area per molecule of oxygen taken up. This calibration factor enables one to calculate the surface area of supported magnesium ferrite. It is necessary to assume that the calibration 343 factor, relating the magnesium ferrite surface area to the amount of oxygen adsorbed, is the same for sup- ported and unsupported magnesium ferrite. The oxi- dation process, as to rate and mechanism, might depend on the type of lattice planes exposed and thus on the particle size. The demand of a common calib- ration factor can therefore be best met with by apply- ing finely divided unsupported magnesium ferrite of a particle size of the same order of magnitude as with the supported catalyst. Using this procedure, at least a reliable comparison of relative free surface areas with- in a group of analogous supported catalysts is possible.
Previously, we have discussed the reduction behavi- our of magnesium ferrite particles supported on mag- nesium oxide [7]. It has been found that magnesium ferrite is reduced to an FeO phase partly via Fe30 4 at temperatures of about 633 K. The FeO phase is stabil- ized by the magnesium oxide support by formation of a. solid solution. Upon further reduction at higher temperatures the FeO phase is reduced to metallic iron. The success of the estimation of the free MgFe20 4 surface area by oxygen chemisorption de- pends on converting the Fe 3 + ion reliably and repro- ducibly into a known lower valence state. Since only part of the magnesium ferrite is reduced via FesO ,, FeO is chosen to be the desired state, prior to oxygen chemisorption. Therefore, the reduction temperature is optimized so as to obtain the FeO phase after reduction. Complete formation of FeO is checked after the surface oxidation experiment by subsequent titration of the bulk to complete oxidation with oxy- gen pulses at increased temperatures. In general FeO is non-stoichiometric (F%O, 0.85 < x < 0.95) but nevertheless will be referred to as FeO [8].To obtain information about the phase changes that take place during the surface and the bulk oxida- tion experiments, the catalysts have also been studied magnetically in situ during the oxygen sorption ex- periments. As discussed earlier [7], iron compounds all have rather different magnetic properties. There- fore, a well based distinction can be made among several iron compounds using magnetic methods. For this purpose a low-field magnetic method is used [9].A prerequisite for using a low-field magnetic method is that particles behave superparamagneticaUy at the temperature at which the magnetization measure- ments are performed. The property of superparamag- netism is exhibited by ferro- or ferrimagnetic com- pounds of very small particle sizes. Superpara- magnetic particles are single domain, which means that they are in a uniform state of magnetization at any applied field. They can be magnetized by a coher- ent rotation of their magnetic moments and therefore behave just like a system of paramagnetic atoms only with a much larger magnetic moment. Using the calculation method of Bean and Livingstone [10] and using magnetic data given by Bartels et al. [tl], the critical particle size below which MgFe20 4 behaves superparamagnetically can be calculated to be 30 nm in diameter at 293 K.The particle sizes calculated from the oxygen chemi- sorption results are compared to those obtained from 344 X-ray line broadening and electron microscopy. Part of these results have been presented previously [6].
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared by means of the incipient wetness impregnation of preshaped magnesium oxide support bodies (Engelhard, Mg-0601 T 1/8") using badly crystallizing organometallic complexes [6]. As organometallic complexes pure ammonium iron(III) EDTA (Merck, Fotopur) and ammonium iron(III) citrate (BakerGrade) were applied. After impregnation the catalysts were dried at atmospheric pressure first at room temperature and then at 393 K, at both temperatures for 16-24h. Finally, the catalysts were calcined in air for 16-24 h usually at 973K to de- compose the metalorganic precursors. The iron load- ings of the catalysts in weight percentage iron were determined by an indirect titration method with EDTA [63. The iron loading is expressed as the calculated weight percentage metallic iron on the magnesium oxide support.Unsupported magnesium ferrite was prepared by air oxidation of an aqueous suspension containing both Mg 2+ and Fe 2+ ions in a 1:2 ratio [12]. The starting solution was prepared by mixing 50ml of aqueous solutions of (NH4)zSO4"FeSO
4"6H20
(0.44 mole) and MgSO4 (0.22 mole). For simultaneous precipitation of both hydroxides Mg(OH)2 and Fe(OH)2, the starting solution was added to a solution of 100g NaOH in 1000ml of water under a nitrogen gas flow. A green precipitate was formed. This suspen- sion was heated and kept at 328 K, while air was bubbled through the suspension, until the green pre- cipitate had changed into a brown precipitate of the ferrite. The precipitate was then separated from the solution by centrifuging and repeatedly washed with deionized water. Finally, the ferrite was calcined in air at 973 K for 36 h.
2.2. Oxygen chemisorption
Chemisorption experiments were performed in a conventional glass vacuum apparatus. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the apparatus. The appar- atus allowed chemisorption experiments in combina- tion with in situ low-field magnetization measure- ments. For this purpose the catalysts were fragmented into particles with sizes between 0.50 and 0.85 mm.
Samples could be reduced in-situ in a 10% Hz/N / flow at temperatures ranging from 293 823 K. For chemisorption experiments pressures as low as
0.133 mPa (metered with a Leybold Heraeus Ionivac
IM 30) could be established using an oil diffusion pump (Leybold Heraeus PD 400). For chemisorption 0 2 (Hoekloos, 99.995%) was applied. Oxygen pulses were metered using a Bourdon-type precision pressure gauge (Texas Instruments, model 145).
Prior to the chemisorption experiment, a catalyst was reduced overnight in a 10% Ha/N 2 gas flow at about 633 K. Subsequently, the sample cell was evacu- ated at the reduction temperature. After 1 h the sample 12 5 Figure 1 A schematic representation of the chemisorption apparatus: Position 1: oxygen gas inlet system; Position 2: cold trap 77 K; Position

The catalyst was evacuated until the pressure was finally below 0.6 mPa. Next,small oxygen doses of about 20-70 Pa (dose volume 200 ml) were admitted at room temperature, while the adsorption time was monitored. It appeared useful to define the adsorption time as the time required to take up about 95% of the dose admitted. After the adsorp- tion times had increased appreciably and surface oxidation had changed into bulk oxidation, the tem- perature was increased to 633 K. Next, to oxidize the bulk, oxygen pulses were admitted until adsorption of oxygen had ceased. From the total amount of oxygen sorbed, the initial oxidation state of the reduced oxide phase could be calculated.
During the adsorption experiments, the magnetiza- tion of the catalyst was measured at room temperature in a low-field a.c.-permeameter, analogous to the one described by Selwood [9] and Geus et al. [13]. Tech- nical data are given by Erkelens and W6sten [14]. The alternating (260 Hz) magnetic field was detected by a lock-in amplifier (Princeton Applied Research, model 5101).
2.3. Other characterization techniques
The BET surface area of unsupported magnesium ferrite was determined by nitrogen physisorption us- ing a Sorptomatic 1800'instrument (Carlo Erba). Ni- trogen adsorption was measured statically at 77 K.Prior to the physisorption experiment, the samples were outgassed in vacuum (0.27 Pa) at 393 K for 3 h.The reduction behaviour was studied with temper- ature programmed reduction
(TPR).
Hydrogen consumption by a catalyst was determined as a func- tion of the temperature. Experiments were performed in a conventional atmospheric flow reactor, as de- scribed earlier [7].
By means of a vibrating sample magnetometer it was established whether the supported magnesium ferrite catalysts behaved superparamagnetically. In this apparatus magnetic field strengths up to
0.95 MAm 1 could be established. The magnetization
of the catalyst samples was measured as a function of the field strength at 293 and 77 K. More details on the apparatus are given by van Stiphout et al. [15].
X-ray diffraction measurements were performed in a Philips powder diffractometer mounted on a Philips PW 1140 X-ray generator with FeKI,2 radiation (X = 0.193735 nm).
Finally, the materials were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (Philips EM 420).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Unsupported magnesium ferrite
As explained above, finely divided unsupported mag- nesium ferrite has been prepared to be used for calib- ration of the oxygen chemisorption technique. An X- ray diffractogram of unsupported magnesium ferrite prepared by coprecipitation of Fe 2 + and Mg 2 ions is shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the calcined pre- cipitate mainly consists of magnesium ferrite. Only very weak diffractions of-Fe20 3 and MgO are found at 42.2 and 47.0 20, respectively. Measurement of the X-ray line broadening does not provide an unambigu- ous mean value for the magnesium ferrite crystallite size.
The BET surface area of the unsupported magne- sium ferrite has been determined using N 2 adsorption.
The surface area of magnesium ferrite is 26.82 m 2 g- 1.
From this surface area an average crystallite size of about 50 nm is calculated, which indicates that the unsupported magnesium ferrite is rather finely divided. 345 6 800 u 50" o m

(x): MgFe204; (9 -Fe203; (A): MgO.In order to determine how reduction of the un- supported magnesium ferrite proceeds, a temperature programmed reduction experiment has been per- formed. Fig. 3 shows the TPR profile. Two large reduction peaks are found with a ratio of the areas of roughly 1:2. The first reduction peak shows a small shoulder on the low temperature side. Evidently re- duction of unsupported magnesium ferrite proceeds in a comparable manner as was found for supported magnesium ferrite particles [7], i.e., reduction via Fe30 4 to an FeO phase and next to metallic iron. The onset temperature for reduction was about 600 K.Oxygen chemisorption has to be performed on a reduced oxidic phase. Since an FeO phase has been chosen to be the desired phase after the reduction pretreatment, the unsupported magnesium ferrite was reduced in a 10% H2/Nz flow at 633 K, i.e., at the steep rise of the first reduction peak. Magnetization measurements on a supported magnesium ferrite cata- lyst have shown that at this temperature magnesium ferrite is fully reduced to a FeO phase [7]. Next an oxygen chemisorption experiment has been performed on the prereduced ferrite. Fig. 4 shows the time re- quired to take up a dose of Oa that is admitted at room temperature, plotted against the total amount of oxygen sorbed per gram of magnesium ferrite. Initially the oxygen doses are adsorbed very rapidly, i.e., in about 30 s. During this stage surface oxidation is proceeding. After 16 pulses the adsorption time in- creases steeply. At the steep rise of the adsorption time surface oxidation has changed into bulk oxidation.During this final stage the oxidation rate has become controlled by diffusion of oxygen through the oxidized surface layer and proceeds only very slowly. The amount of oxygen required to oxidize the surface is defined as the amount V,ds at the intersection of the two solid lines shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the unsupported magnesium ferrite used in this experi- ment, after reduction at 633 K, takes up 8.02 ml STP O2 per gram of magnesium ferrite. By increasing the temperature to about 633 K and admitting oxygen doses at that temperature, the bulk of the magnesium ferrite is oxidized. From the total amount of oxygen taken up by the reduced ferrite during both surface and bulk oxidation, i.e., 60.1 ml STP 0 2 per gram, it is calculated that the degree of reduction to the FeO phase was indeed 100%. No Fe304 or Fe was present after the reduction at 633 K.From this result and the magnesium ferrite BET surface area, the calibration factor, relating the specific magnesium ferrite surface area to the amount of oxy- gen required to oxidize the surface, can be calculated. 9 This calibration factor is found to be 3.34 m 2 ml-1 STP 0 2. In all experiments discussed hereafter, this factor will be used to calculate the surface area of supported magnesium ferrite from the amount of chemisorbed oxygen. From the crystallite size of 50 nm and the amounts of oxygen required for oxida- tion of the surface and the bulk of the particles,respectively, it can be calculated that surface oxidation of the FeO phase proceeds as deep as about 1 nm,which is considerably more than one monolayer, as was discussed in the introduction. . 200 1000 1200 400 600

3.2. 1. Oxygen chemisorption
It has already been mentioned that the reliability of the results should depend on reacting the iron species to a known lower valence state in a controlled way.
First of all, therefore, the temperature of reduction prior to the oxygen chemisorption experiment has been varied, to determine the reliability of the thus obtained surface areas. Next, the reduced samples have been titrated at room temperature to establish surface oxidation, followed by titration at 633 K to establish bulk oxidation of the reduced catalyst. Plots representing bulk oxidation performed at 633 K for a
1.0 wt % Fe/MgO catalyst (ex citrate) prereduced at
different temperatures are shown in Fig. 5. In this figure the amount of oxygen sorbed at 633 K is plotted against the oxygen pressure. From the total amount of oxygen required for complete oxidation at 633 K, the initial oxidation state after reduction can be deduced.
The dashed lines indicate the amounts of oxygen required if the state of the catalyst after reduction pretreatment would be either F%O4, FeO or metallic iron. If after complete oxidation a value for the re- quired amount of oxygen is obtained being between two dashed lines, it is considered that both com- pounds are present simultaneously. The relative amounts of each can be calculated from the total amount of oxygen required for complete oxidation and the total amount of iron present. For these calcu- lations the FeO is assumed to be stoichiometric. It can be seen that after reduction of the 1.0wt % Fe/MgO catalyst at about 653 K all iron is present as FeO.
Beyond this value a considerable amount of metallic iron is formed upon reduction, e.g., at 673 K about 20% of the iron is present as Fe Below 653 K Fe30 4 is formed next to FeO. The amount of Fe30 4 increases as the temperature of reduction pretreatment is low- ered.
The influence of the initial oxidation state after the reduction on the amount of oxygen required for sur- face oxidation is shown in Fig. 6. In this figure time-adsorption plots of the 1.0 wt % Fe/MgO cata- lyst measured at room temperature after reduction at several temperatures ranging from 613 to 673 K are

The temperature of the reduction pretreatment was varied between 613 and 673 K: (I) 613;(II) 633; (III) 653 and (IV) 673 K. shown. When the temperature of the reduction pre- treatment is increased and the composition of the reduced catalysts changes from Fe30 4 via FeO to Fe (Fig. 5), the amount of oxygen required for surface oxidation at room temperature also strongly in- creases. It is evident that the presence of iron species other than the desired FeO phase, i.e., Fe304 or Fe,strongly influences the obtained results. So, for each catalyst to be studied with oxygen chemisorption, the reduction temperature is optimized so as to obtain a maximum amount of FeO, and a minimum of both F%O4 and Fe.For catalysts prepared by impregnation of magne- sium oxide with ammonium iron(III) citrate, with loadings of 1.0, 2.1, and 3.1 wt% Fe, the oxygen adsorption plots are shown in Fig. 7. For all these catalysts the iron is almost completely present as Fe 2 + after reduction pretreatment, as has been determined by bulk oxidation at 633 K afterwards. Reduction temperatures and iron loadings are given in Table I. It can be seen in Fig. 7 that when the iron loading is increased, the amount of oxygen taken up by the surface also increases. It is also apparent that as the catalyst loading is increased and thus the amount of ferrite in the sample cell, the sharp change from 347 TABLE I.

The amounts of oxygen required for surface oxidation, the calculated surface area, and the crystallite sizes are given in Table I, together with the results from trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray line broadening (XRLB) [6]. For catalysts prepared by impregnation with ammonium iron(III) EDTA the results are also given in Table I. For the calculation of the crystallite sizes, the particles are assumed to be of a spherical shape. Generally, for catalysts prepared from either of the complexes, crystallite sizes of about 20-23 nm are found using oxygen chemisorption. This is equivalent to a specific surface area of about 60 m 2 per gram of magnesium ferrite. At higher loadings the crystallite sizes tend to increase, as is clearly observed for a 4.4 wt % Fe/MgO catalyst (ex EDTA). Further- more, the value of 18 nm obtained for a 2.8 wt% Fe/MgO catalyst (ex EDTA), which is observed with oxygen chemisorption, is rather low if compared to values obtained for other iron loadings. The high extent of oxygen sorption and, hence, the small size can be explained by the presence of about 5% metallic iron next to the FeO phase directly after reduction pretreatment, in spite of the low reduction temper- ature of only 593 K. Lowering the reduction temper- ature before the oxygen chemisorption experiment even further, to prevent the formation of metallic iron,results in an unreduced layer within the catalyst bed,which would surely lead to unreliable results. The formation of metallic iron even at 593 K might point to the presence of some 0-Fe203, which is not reduced via the stabilized FeO phase, but via Fe30 4 directly to 348 metallic iron. However, no 0-Fe20 3 diffraction lines are observed in the fresh catalyst using electron dif- fraction. Still the value of 18 nm is not very anomal- ous, since transmission electron microscopy also gives a rather low value of 18 nm.
As mentioned above, in Table I the crystallite sizes are also given, these have been obtained from trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray line broadening. For the catalysts prepared from ammon- ium iron(Ill) citrate, crystallite sizes of about 18-19 nm are found using both methods. These values are essentially the same as those that have been found using the chemisorption technique. For the 1.0 wt % Fe/MgO catalyst (ex citrate) catalysts the diffraction intensities of X-ray diffraction pattern were too low to allow the determination of crystallite sizes. This is also the case for the EDTA catalysts with low iron content.
The particle sizes obtained with TEM are in good agreement with those obtained with oxygen sorption.
3.2.2. Magnetization measurements
As found above, the sizes of the magnesium ferrite particles within the catalysts studied are about 20 nm.
As mentioned in the introduction, the particles are therefore expected to behave superparamagnetically.
This has been checked by high-field magnetic meas- urements using a vibrating sample magnetometer. The magnetization of the 3.1 wt % Fe/MgO catalyst (ex citrate) has been measured as a function of the field strength at 293 K. The catalyst did not show re- manence, nor did it show the flattening in a plot of the magnetization against the reciprocal field strength,which is characteristic for non-superparamagnetic be- haviour [13, 15]. The magnesium ferrite particles thus behave superparamagnetically.
The magnetization of a partially reduced 4.4 wt % Fe/MgO catalyst (ex EDTA) has been monitored in a low-field a.c.-permeameter, during oxygen sorption first at room temperature and then at 633 K, and finally during oxidation at 773 K. The magnetization measured has been normalized to the magnetization of the fresh catalyst before reduction, i.e, Mo. Hence,the magnetization of the flesh catalyst is defined as being unity. When the catalyst is reduced at 627 K,which is indicated as stage I in Fig. 8, the relative magnetization M/M o strongly decreases from 1.0 to a value of 0.14. This decrease confirms the results of magnetization measurements described earlier [7],o 1.0

heating in oxygen at 773 K. and clearly shows that the MgFe20 4 particles are reduced to an anti-ferromagnetic FeO phase. The remaining signal is ascribed to a slight amount of Fe304.
Next, oxygen pulses have been admitted to the reduced catalyst. Firstly, the surface is oxidized at 293 K and, secondly, the bulk is oxidized at 633 K.
Fig. 8 shows the relative magnetization plotted as a function of the relative amount of oxygen that has been sorbed. The amount of oxygen has been normal- ized to the total amount of oxygen sorbed during both oxidation steps and is referred to as the degree of titration, X. Surface oxidation at 293 K, designated as stage II, has ended at X = 0.26, which equals about
1.15 mlSTP O z per gram of catalyst. At X--- 1.0 the
bulk oxidation is complete. As can be seen in Fig. 8 during the surface oxidation the magnetization re- mains constant. From this it can be derived that oxidation of the anti-ferromagnetic FeO phase pro- ceeds either to some supersaturated form of FexO,with a low value of x, or to anti-ferromagnetic ct- Fe20 a. On the basis of these results solely no discrim- ination can be made between either of the two possib- ilities. Since in general FeO is not stable at temper- atures below 843 K [16, 17], the authors are inclined to prefer the latter explanation involving the zt-FezOa,not denying the stabilizing role which magnesium oxide might play. Since beyond X = 0.26, the uptake of oxygen at 293 K ceases; the oxygen sorption experi- ment was continued at 633 K. This is referred to as stage III. After a dose of oxygen was admitted at 633 K and taken up, the sample cell was cooled to room temperature, after which the magnetization was measured: As was shown before, at 633 K bulk oxida- tion proceeds. In Fig. 8 it can be seen that at first the relative magnetization increases. Above about X = 0.75 the relative magnetization decreases again.
Since the rate of bulk oxidation is limited by the transport of oxygen through the oxidized surface layer, the FeO phase is not rapidly oxidized to - Fe20 3. Rather the oxidation proceeds slowly and stepwise via an Fe30 4 phase. This phase is ferrimagne- tic. Subsequently, as the oxidation proceeds, the Fe30 4 is gradually transformed into anti-ferromagne- tic -Fe203 . This explains the initial increase followed by a decrease of the magnetization.
The oxidation of Fe30 4 has been extensively stud- ied by Feitknecht and co-workers [18-20]. He found that, ferrimagnetic y-Fe20 3 is formed, when Fe30 4 is carefully oxidized at temperatures below about 573 to 673 K. y-FezO 3 rapidly transforms into -Fe20 3 at about 773 to 873 K. At about 623 K this trans- formation proceeds slowly. According to the observa- tions of Feitknecht and co,workers [18-20], some 3'-Fe203 might therefore have been formed next to -Fe20 3 during the bulk oxidation experiment at 633 K. To establish formation of y-Fe203, the catalyst has been kept at 773 K at the end of the bulk oxida- tion experiment at 633 K. The effect on the magnetiza- tion is indicated in Fig. 8 by stage IV. If any y-Fe203,which is ferrimagnetic, is present, it should rapidly transform into anti-ferromagnetic -Fe20 3 at 773 K.A decrease of the magnetization of M/Mo = 0.26 to
0.14 is observed, which indicates that next to -Fe/Oa
some ,-Fe/O 3 has been formed during the bulk oxida- tion at 633 K.
4. Conclusions
As far as the preparation of unsupported magnesium ferrite is concerned, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen physisorption experiments have shown, that rather finely divided magnesium ferrite is obtained by Copre- cipitation of Mg 2+ and Fe z+ ions and subsequent oxidation. Using the thus prepared magnesium ferrite,the calibration factor relating the magnesium ferrite surface area to the oxygen chemisorption has been found to be 3.34m/m1-1 STP O2. Applying this calibration factor, the free surface area of the sup- ported magnesium ferrite is found to be about 60 m 2 per gram of magnesium ferrite independent of the catalyst loading and the type of precursors. This corresponds to an average crystallite size of about 22 nm. Essentially, the same values have been ob- tained using X-ray diffraction and transmission elec- tron microscopy. At high loadings the crystallite sizes are not significantly higher. It can be concluded that a higher iron loading does not lead to larger crystallites but rather to more crystallites of the same size.
From the magnetization measurements it can be concluded that during the surface oxidation at 293 K the FeO phase at the surface is rapidly oxidized to -Fe/O3. This confirms earlier observations that FeO is not homogeneously dissolved in the MgO phase [6], but is concentrated at the surface of the particles.
After the surface has been rapidly oxidized, further oxidation proceeds slowly. The rate is controlled by oxygen diffusion through the oxidized surface layer.
At 633 K bulk oxidation proceeds at a much higher rate, but not directly to -Fe203. FeO is oxidized via Fe304 to both 7-FeaO3 and -Fe20 a.
The conformity of the results from oxygen chemi- sorption on the on e hand, and X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy on the other, is very good, taking into account the entirely different back- ground of these techniques. It justifies the use of the 349 calibration factor, that relates the magnesium ferrite surface area to the amount of oxygen sorbed, for both supported and unsupported magnesium ferrite. This was achieved by applying finely divided unsupported magnesium ferrite for calibration.
The other requirement is involved with the reduc- tion pretreatment. It appears to be highly important that the magnesium ferrite is uniquely reduced to an FeO phase and that the presence of other iron species,such as, Fe304 or Fe is prohibited. From Fig. 6 it can be concluded, that all three magnesia-supported iron compounds take up different amounts of oxygen per unit surface area. A final bulk titration experiment at increased temperatures after the surface oxida- tion, however, has proven to be a reliable method to determine the oxidation state after the reduction pretreatment.
A remark has to be made about the catalyst texture.
The catalyst support used for the preparation of the catalysts studied here contained pores with an average radius of about 90 nm [21], allowing for rapid oxygen transport through the pores of the support to the iron containing particles. However, care has to be taken with catalysts containing much smaller pores. Then the rate of surface oxidation will be controlled by oxygen diffusion through the pores, just like bulk oxidation is controlled by oxygen diffusion through the oxidized layer. This will obscure the change from surface to bulk oxidation. The effect is similar to what is observed, when the catalyst loading is increased, as has been shown in Fig. 7.
Selective oxygen chemisorption is an excellent tech- nique for the determination of the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magne-. sium oxide. It is applicable to many other catalyst systems. The prerequisite, however, remains that oxi- dation of the surface proceeds at much higher rate than that of the bulk. The results also depend on the ability to convert the metal oxide reliably and com- pletely into a known lower oxidation state. When these requirements are fulfilled, oxygen sorption is able to provide an accurate average value for the free active surface area and, hence, a reliable mean value for the crystallite size.
