<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The free surface area of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide has been determined using selective oxygen chemisorption at room temperature. The oxygen chemisorption experiments were performed on reduced catalysts. It has appeared to be essential that the iron oxide phase, which is present as MgFe2O4 in the fresh calcined catalysts, is reduced uniquely to FeO, prior to the chemisorption experiment.

铁氧化物催化剂在镁氧化物上的自由表面积通过选择性氧化学吸附在室温下确定。在进行化学吸附实验前，铁氧化物相必须被还原成唯一的FeO状态，因为其存在于新鲜煅烧催化剂中的形式为MgFe2O4。

An alternative procedure, namely, selective chemisorption of oxygen onto partially reduced oxide catalysts, however, has proven to be fairly accurate. This method has been applied on supported V2O5 catalysts by van DiUen [2]. Weller has reviewed results of oxygen chemisorption on supported and unsupported Cr2O3 and MoO2 catalysts [3]. Van der Wal [4] and van de Berg et al. [5] have adsorbed oxygen selectively onto supported and unsupported Fe2O3 catalysts,respectively.

The alternative procedure of selective oxygen chemisorption onto partially reduced oxide catalysts has proven to be fairly accurate. This technique was employed on supported V2O5 catalysts by van DiUen [2]. Weller summarized the outcomes of oxygen chemisorption on both supported and unsupported Cr2O3 and MoO2 catalysts [3]. Van der Wal [4] and van de Berg et al. [5] selectively adsorbed oxygen onto supported and unsupported Fe2O3 catalysts individually.

Since surface oxidation is probably not limited to the first monolayer, the amount of oxygen adsorbed cannot be directly related to the active oxidic surface area. Therefore, the method will have to be calibrated.

For catalysts prepared by impregnation of magnesium oxide with ammonium iron(III) citrate, with loadings of 1.0, 2.1, and 3.1 wt% Fe, the oxygen adsorption plots are shown in Fig. 7. For all these catalysts the iron is almost completely present as Fe2+ after reduction pretreatment, as has been determined by bulk oxidation at 633 K afterwards.

The conformity of the results from oxygen chemisorption on the one hand, and X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy on the other, is very good, taking into account the entirely different background of these techniques. It justifies the use of the calibration factor, that relates the magnesium ferrite surface area to the amount of oxygen sorbed, for both supported and unsupported magnesium ferrite.

The consistency between the oxygen chemisorption results and those obtained via X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy is commendable, considering the distinct methodologies behind these approaches.
