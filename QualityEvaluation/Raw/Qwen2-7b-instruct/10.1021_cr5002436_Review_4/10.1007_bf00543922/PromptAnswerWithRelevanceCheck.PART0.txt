<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The free surface area of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide has been determined using selective oxygen chemisorption at room temperature. The oxygen chemisorption experiments were performed on reduced catalysts. It has appeared to be essential that the iron oxide phase, which is present as MgFe2O4 in the fresh calcined catalysts, is reduced uniquely to FeO, prior to the chemisorption experiment.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

An alternative procedure, namely, selective chemisorption of oxygen onto partially reduced oxide catalysts, however, has proven to be fairly accurate. This method has been applied on supported V2O5 catalysts by van DiUen [2]. Weller has reviewed results of oxygen chemisorption on supported and unsupported Cr2O3 and MoO2 catalysts [3]. Van der Wal [4] and van de Berg et al. [5] have adsorbed oxygen selectively onto supported and unsupported Fe2O3 catalysts,respectively.

Since surface oxidation is probably not limited to the first monolayer, the amount of oxygen adsorbed cannot be directly related to the active oxidic surface area. Therefore, the method will have to be calibrated.

The conformity of the results from oxygen chemisorption on the one hand, and X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy on the other, is very good, taking into account the entirely different background of these techniques.

It has appeared to be essential that the iron oxide phase, which is present as MgFe204 in the fresh calcined catalysts, is reduced uniquely to FeO, prior to the chemisorption experiment.

The free surface area of iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide was assessed using selective oxygen chemisorption at room temperature. Essential to the process is the unique reduction of the iron oxide phase from MgFe2O4 to FeO prior to the chemisorption experiment. Typically, crystallite sizes around 20-23 nm were observed, irrespective of the catalyst loading or precursor type. Higher iron loadings do not result in larger crystallites but rather more of the same-sized crystallites.

From the magnetization measurements it can be concluded that during the surface oxidation at 293 K the FeO phase at the surface is rapidly oxidized to -Fe/O3. This confirms earlier observations that FeO is not homogeneously dissolved in the MgO phase but is concentrated at the surface of the particles.

Selective oxygen chemisorption is an excellent technique for the determination of the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magnesium oxide. It is applicable to many other catalyst systems. The prerequisite, however, remains that oxidation of the surface proceeds at much higher rate than that of the bulk. The results also depend on the ability to convert the metal oxide reliably and completely into a known lower oxidation state.
