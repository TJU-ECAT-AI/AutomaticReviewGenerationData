[1] "Selective oxygen chemisorption is an excellent technique for the determination of the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magnesium oxide. It is applicable to many other catalyst systems."
[2] "It has already been mentioned that the reliability of the results should depend on reacting the iron species to a known lower valence state in a controlled way."
[3] "As found above, the sizes of the magnesium ferrite particles within the catalysts studied are about 20 nm."
[4] "From the magnetization measurements it can be concluded that during the surface oxidation at 293 K the FeO phase at the surface is rapidly oxidized to -Fe/O3."

The literature discusses the use of selective oxygen chemisorption for determining the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magnesium oxide. This technique is applicable to various other catalyst systems. The reliability of the results depends on accurately reducing iron species to a known lower valence state. The study found that magnesium ferrite particles within the catalysts have sizes around 20 nm. Additionally, the surface oxidation at 293 K results in the rapid oxidation of the FeO phase to -Fe/O3.

文献讨论了选择性氧化学吸附技术用于确定镁铁氧体催化剂上镁氧化物的活性表面积。该技术适用于多种其他催化剂系统。结果的可靠性取决于准确地将铁物种还原为已知的较低价态。研究发现，催化剂中的镁铁氧体颗粒大小约为20纳米。此外，在293 K下的表面氧化导致FeO相迅速氧化至-Fe/O3。
