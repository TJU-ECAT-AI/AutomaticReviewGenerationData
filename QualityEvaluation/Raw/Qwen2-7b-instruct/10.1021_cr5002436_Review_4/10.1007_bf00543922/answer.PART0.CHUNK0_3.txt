[1] "Selective oxygen chemisorption is an excellent technique for the determination of the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magnesium oxide."
[2] "The results also depend on the ability to convert the metal oxide reliably and completely into a known lower oxidation state."
[3] "When these requirements are fulfilled, oxygen sorption is able to provide an accurate average value for the free active surface area and, hence, a reliable mean value for the crystallite size."

Selective oxygen chemisorption is a highly effective method for assessing the active surface area of magnesium ferrite catalysts supported on magnesium oxide. The accuracy of the technique hinges on the catalyst's capability to undergo reliable and complete conversion to a known lower oxidation state. Once these prerequisites are met, oxygen sorption yields a precise average estimate of the free active surface area, along with a dependable average crystallite size.
