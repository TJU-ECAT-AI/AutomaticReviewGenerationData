Numerical methods can provide structural solutions to materials lacking long-range order. Researchers have developed a computational technique for building up cluster structures one atom at a time using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from high-resolution diffraction data. This method has been successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60, matching experimental data closely despite slight deviations due to noise and experimental limitations. This approach holds promise for being widely applicable to aperiodic materials.

数值方法可以为缺乏长程有序的材料提供结构解决方案。研究人员开发了一种计算技术，通过使用从高分辨率衍射数据中获得的原子对分布函数（PDF）来逐个构建簇结构。这种方法成功应用于推断Buckyball（C60）的结构，其计算数据集与实验测量结果高度匹配，尽管存在由于噪声和实验限制导致的轻微偏差。这一方法有望广泛应用于非周期性材料。
