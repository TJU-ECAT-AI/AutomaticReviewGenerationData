<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The numerical method enables the determination of atomic structures for aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles, by utilizing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples. These PDFs provide lists of interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs sharing specific spacings. Despite slight deviations from the ideal structure of C60 due to measurement noise and limitations, the calculated data closely matches experimental measurements.

Numerical methods can provide structural solutions to materials lacking long-range order. Researchers have developed a computational technique for building up cluster structures one atom at a time using atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from high-resolution diffraction data. This method has been successfully applied to deduce the structure of C60, matching experimental data closely despite slight deviations due to noise and experimental limitations. This approach holds promise for being widely applicable to aperiodic materials.

Numerical methods have been devised to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and materials lacking long-range order, using data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies on powder samples and other non-crystalline materials. This involves analyzing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), which provide information about interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs at specific distances. The accuracy of the deduced structure can be influenced by noise in the data and experimental limitations. The method was successfully applied to deduce the structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) using neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample. The approach holds promise for being broadly applicable to the determination of structures for a variety of aperiodic materials.
