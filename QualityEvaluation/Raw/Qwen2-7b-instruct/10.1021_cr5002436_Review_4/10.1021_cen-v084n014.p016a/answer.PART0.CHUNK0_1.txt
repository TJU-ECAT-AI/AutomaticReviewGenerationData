[1] "Researchers have developed a numerical procedure for determining the atomic structures of aperiodic materials using the type of data measured in X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of powders and other noncrystalline samples."
[2] "The data, which are known as atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), consist of lists of interatomic spacings and a histogram that indicates how many atom pairs share a particular spacing."
[3] "The team reports that the calculated data set matches the experimentally measured results quite closely, yet the computed structure deviates slightly from the ideal structure of C60 due to noise in the data and experimental limitations."

The numerical method enables the determination of atomic structures for aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles, by utilizing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from X-ray and neutron-diffraction studies of noncrystalline samples. These PDFs provide lists of interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs sharing specific spacings. Despite slight deviations from the ideal structure of C60 due to measurement noise and limitations, the calculated data closely matches experimental measurements.

该数值方法允许通过利用非晶样品的X射线和中子衍射研究得到的原子配对分布函数（PDF）来确定无序材料的原子结构。这些PDF提供了原子间距离的列表以及共享特定距离的原子对的数量频率。尽管与理想C60结构相比存在轻微偏差，这主要是由于测量噪声和限制导致的，但计算数据与实验测量结果非常接近。
