Numerical methods have been devised to determine the atomic structures of aperiodic materials, such as nanoparticles and materials lacking long-range order, using data from X-ray and neutron diffraction studies on powder samples and other non-crystalline materials. This involves analyzing atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), which provide information about interatomic spacings and the frequency of atom pairs at specific distances. The accuracy of the deduced structure can be influenced by noise in the data and experimental limitations. The method was successfully applied to deduce the structure of buckminsterfullerene (C60) using neutron-scattering measurements on a solid-phase sample. The approach holds promise for being broadly applicable to the determination of structures for a variety of aperiodic materials.

已经开发出数值方法来确定无序材料（如纳米颗粒和缺乏长程有序的材料）的原子结构，使用粉末样本和其他非晶态材料的X射线和中子衍射研究数据。这涉及到分析原子对分布函数（PDFs），提供关于原子间距的信息以及特定距离上的原子对频率。确定结构的准确性可能受到数据噪声和实验限制的影响。该方法成功应用于利用固体样品的中子散射测量确定Buckminsterfullerene（C60）的结构。这种方法有望广泛适用于确定各种无序材料的结构。
