[1] "Bulk nitrogen doping can efficiently improve the catalytic performance of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH)."
[2] "When doped with nitrogen, a large amount of propene was produced and the formation rate showed a proportional relationship with the N content."
[3] "As the reaction approached the steady state, NCNT-1 with the highest N% value exhibited a superior activity of 8.8 mmol m\(^2\) h\(^{-1}\), being 2.4 times that of the undoped CNT."
[4] "Such an improvement is quite different from the suppressed activity of the CNT by modification with boron and phosphorus oxides,6 indicating a particular promotion effect of the nitrogen dopant."
[5] "The doped samples exhibited a superior activity 1.63.5 times that of undoped CNT."
[6] "With the increasing N content, the O\(_2\) reaction order and Ea solely decreased while the C\(_3\)H\(_8\) reaction order varied (0.60 ± 0.05)."
[7] "The N atoms occupied the vertex of a hexagon and a pentagon at the exposed defects or the edge of a graphitic sheet and were unstable due to the high density of electrons."
[8] "Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to the graphitic sheet25 and improve the electron mobility from the basal plane to the intermediate O\(_2\) , promoting the final dissociation of gas-phase O\(_2\) to nucleophilic O\(_2\) species."
[9] "For the ODH process, the doped N atoms reduce the dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure and finally decrease the reaction order of oxygen (Fig. 3b)."
[10] "The asymmetric N1s spectra of doped samples can be fitted to five peaks centered at 398.5, 400.4, 401.4, 403.6 and 405.6 eV, which are assigned to pyridinic N (N1), pyrrolic N and/or pyridone (N2), graphitic N (N3),pyridine-N-oxide (N4) and CON (N5), respectively (ESI, Fig. S7 and Table S4)."

The enhanced catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the graphitic structure. These nitrogen atoms donate electrons to the graphitic lattice, introducing metallic or semiconductive features and narrowing the energy gap. This facilitates electron transfer from the carbon nanotube to adsorbed oxygen species, promoting the activation of oxygen. The nitrogen dopants speed up the dissociative adsorption of oxygen molecules and reduce the overall activation energy of the reaction. The presence of graphitic nitrogen species plays a pivotal role in improving the catalytic performance of the material. The enhancement in activity is observed with increasing nitrogen content, and the promotion effect of nitrogen doping differs from that of boron and phosphorus oxides, which suppress the catalytic activity. The mechanism involves the donation of electrons by the nitrogen atoms, which improves electron mobility and facilitates the dissociation of oxygen molecules, thus accelerating the reaction rate.

氮掺杂碳纳米管在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的增强催化活性归因于碳纳米管中引入的氮原子。这些氮原子向石墨烯层捐赠电子，引入金属或半导体特性，并缩小能量间隙。这促进了从碳纳米管到吸附氧物种的电子转移，从而促进氧气的活化。氮掺杂剂加速了氧分子的离解吸附并降低了整个激活能。图3b显示，掺杂氮原子减少了氧气部分压力对反应速率的依赖性，并最终降低了氧气的反应级数。石墨氮物种在提高催化性能方面起着决定性作用。随着氮含量的增加，观察到活动性的增强，而氮掺杂的促进效果与硼和磷氧化物抑制活性不同。机制涉及氮原子捐赠电子，这改善了电子的流动性，并且有助于氧气分子的分解，从而加速了反应速率。
