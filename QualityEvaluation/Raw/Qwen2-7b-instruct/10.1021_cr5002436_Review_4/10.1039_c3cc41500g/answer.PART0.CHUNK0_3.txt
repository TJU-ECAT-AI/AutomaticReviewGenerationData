[1] "Bulk nitrogen doping can efficiently improve the catalytic performance of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH)."
[2] "The graphitic nitrogen plays a determining role in enhancing their activity by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction."
[3] "Recent theoretical studies have shown that the incorporated N atoms can reduce the gap between the highest-occupied molecular orbitals and the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals, which would make the electron transfer from the CNT to the adsorbed oxygen species easy."
[4] "An electron rearrangement of O2 from the triplet ground state 3O2 to active 2O2 occurs during the adsorption process."
[5] "When doped with nitrogen, a large amount of propene was produced and the formation rate showed a proportional relationship with the N content."
[6] "The undoped CNT displayed the lowest activity."
[7] "Obviously, the undoped CNT displayed the lowest activity."
[8] "As the reaction approached the steady state, NCNT-1 with the highest N% value exhibited a superior activity of 8.8 mmol m2 h1, being 2.4 times that of the undoped CNT."
[9] "The variation of selectivity to propene with the conversion of propane was obtained by varying the space velocity (Fig. 1b)."
[10] "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to investigate the promotion effect of doped nitrogen on the alkane conversion by the chemical kinetics method."
[11] "Noting that nearly one fourth of nitrogen was lost after ODH reaction whereas the catalytic performance of NCNTs remained fairly stable."
[12] "The asymmetric N1s spectra of doped samples can be fitted to five peaks centered at 398.5, 400.4, 401.4, 403.6 and 405.6 eV, which are assigned to pyridinic N (N1), pyrrolic N and/or pyridone (N2), graphitic N (N3), pyridine-N-oxide (N4) and CON (N5), respectively."
[13] "There is no apparent correlation between propane order and graphitic N since the C_Q_O component is responsible for breaking CH bonds in propane molecules."
[14] "Furthermore, the amount of graphitic N in used samples was quite close to that in fresh samples (ESI, Fig. S9), in accordance with the observed stability in Fig. 1a."
[15] "Previous studies revealed that the adsorption and activation of gas-phase molecular oxygen occurred at the defects."
[16] "Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to the graphitic sheet and improve the electron mobility from the basal plane to the intermediate O2, promoting the final dissociation of gas-phase O2 to nucleophilic O2 species."
[17] "In addition, the doped N atoms may facilitate propene to desorb from the surface due to the repulsion between the electron-rich graphitic surface and unsaturated C_Q_C bonds of propene."
[18] "Apparently, the graphitic N played a vital role in reducing the overall activation energy and consequently increasing the reaction rate."
[19] "We believe that the graphitic nitrogen may play a determining role in enhancing the catalytic activity by decreasing the overall activation energy and speeding up the activation of oxygen."
[20] "Such a concept can be used for other reactions such as selective oxidation, electrochemical oxygen reduction, peroxidation, etc."
