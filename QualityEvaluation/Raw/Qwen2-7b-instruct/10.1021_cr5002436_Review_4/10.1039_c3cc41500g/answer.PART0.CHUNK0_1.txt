Various carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms. Nitrogen doping can significantly enhance the catalytic performance of CNTs by accelerating the activation of oxygen and lowering the overall activation energy of the reaction. This leads to increased propene production, with the formation rate showing a direct relationship with the nitrogen content. The graphitic nitrogen species play a crucial role in improving the catalytic performance. The undoped CNTs display the lowest activity, while nitrogen-doped CNTs show superior activity. The morphological analysis reveals that nitrogen doping alters the structure of the carbon catalysts, resulting in a bamboo-like structure with interlinked compartments. This structure facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and enhances its activation, contributing to the improved catalytic activity. The distribution of nitrogen atoms within the carbon framework is uniform, and their presence does not alter the stability of the material significantly. The adsorption of oxygen is favored by nitrogen doping, which reduces the dependence on oxygen partial pressure and decreases the reaction order of oxygen. This mechanism differs from surface modifications or grafting with heteroatoms, expanding the understanding of carbon catalysis.

各种碳基材料，包括碳纳米管（CNT），在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性，由于氮原子的掺杂。氮掺杂可以显著提高CNT的催化性能，通过加速氧气的活化和降低反应的整体活化能。这导致丙烯产量增加，形成速率与氮含量成正比关系。石墨氮物种在提高催化性能方面起着关键作用。未掺氮的CNT显示出最低的活性，而氮掺杂的CNT则显示出优越的活性。形态分析表明，氮掺杂改变了碳催化剂的结构，形成了具有相互连接隔间的竹子状结构。这种结构促进了氧气的吸附并增强了其活化，从而促进催化活性的改善。氮原子在碳框架中的分布均匀，并且其存在对材料的稳定性影响不大。氮掺杂有利于氧气的吸附，减少对氧气分压的依赖并降低氧气反应的级数。这一机制与表面改性或与异种原子接枝不同，扩展了对碳催化作用的理解。
