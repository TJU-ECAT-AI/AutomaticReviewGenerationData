Various carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), exhibit enhanced catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms. This is primarily attributed to the graphitic nitrogen species, which speeds up the activation of oxygen and decreases the overall activation energy of the reaction. As a result, nitrogen-doped CNTs demonstrate significantly higher activity compared to undoped counterparts, especially when subjected to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH). The activity of nitrogen-doped CNTs is proportional to the nitrogen content, with the highest activity observed in samples with the highest nitrogen percentage. The incorporation of nitrogen atoms facilitates faster dissociative adsorption of oxygen molecules and reduces the activation energy required for the reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. The graphitic nitrogen plays a pivotal role in improving the catalytic performance, aligning with theoretical predictions. This phenomenon holds implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, particularly in high-temperature applications such as ODH reactions.

各种碳基材料，包括碳纳米管（CNT），在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出增强的催化活性，主要是由于氮原子的掺杂。这主要归因于石墨氮物种，它们加速了氧气的活化并降低了反应的整体活化能。氮掺杂CNT显示出与未掺杂对照相比显著更高的活性，尤其是在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODH）过程中。掺杂氮原子的活性与氮含量成正比，最高活性在氮百分比最高的样品中观察到。氮原子的掺入促进了氧分子的快速解离吸附，并减少了反应所需的活化能，从而提高了催化性能。石墨氮在提高催化性能方面起着决定性作用，与理论预测一致。这一现象对开发新型和高效碳基催化剂具有重要影响，特别是对于高温应用如ODH反应。
