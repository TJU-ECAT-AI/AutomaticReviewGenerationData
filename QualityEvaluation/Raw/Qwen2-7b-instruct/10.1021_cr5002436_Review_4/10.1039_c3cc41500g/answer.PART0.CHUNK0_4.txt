Various carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms. This enhancement is attributed to the role of graphitic nitrogen in accelerating the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction. The presence of nitrogen doping leads to a proportional increase in the formation rate of propene with the N content. The catalytic performance is closely correlated with the structure of the material, specifically the graphitic nitrogen species. The reaction order and activation energy of oxygen decrease with increased nitrogen content, while the reaction order of propane varies. The morphology of the carbon catalysts is examined using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The superior activity of nitrogen-doped CNTs compared to undoped CNTs is evident. The amount of active CQO species does not directly correlate with the reaction rate. Graphitic nitrogen plays a crucial role in reducing the overall activation energy, thereby increasing the reaction rate.

各种碳基材料，包括碳纳米管（CNT），在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，这是由于氮原子的掺杂。这种增强归因于石墨氮在加速氧气活化和降低反应的整体活化能方面的作用。氮掺杂的存在导致丙烯形成速率与氮含量成正比增加。催化性能与材料的结构紧密相关，特别是石墨氮物种。氧气的反应级数和活化能随着氮含量的增加而减少，而丙烷的反应级数则发生变化。通过高分辨率透射电子显微镜（TEM）检查了碳催化剂的形态。氮掺杂的CNTs的优越活性与未掺杂CNTs相比是明显的。活性CQO物种的数量与反应速率之间没有直接关系。石墨氮在降低整体活化能、从而提高反应速率方面起着关键作用。
