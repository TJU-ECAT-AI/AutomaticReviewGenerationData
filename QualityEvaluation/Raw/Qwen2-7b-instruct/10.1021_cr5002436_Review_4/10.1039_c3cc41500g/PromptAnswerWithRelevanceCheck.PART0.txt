Various carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), exhibit enhanced catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms. This is primarily attributed to the graphitic nitrogen species, which speeds up the activation of oxygen and decreases the overall activation energy of the reaction. As a result, nitrogen-doped CNTs demonstrate significantly higher activity compared to undoped counterparts, especially when subjected to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH). The activity of nitrogen-doped CNTs is proportional to the nitrogen content, with the highest activity observed in samples with the highest nitrogen percentage. The incorporation of nitrogen atoms facilitates faster dissociative adsorption of oxygen molecules and reduces the activation energy required for the reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. The graphitic nitrogen plays a pivotal role in improving the catalytic performance, aligning with theoretical predictions. This phenomenon holds implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, particularly in high-temperature applications such as ODH reactions.

Various carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms. Nitrogen doping can significantly enhance the catalytic performance of CNTs by accelerating the activation of oxygen and lowering the overall activation energy of the reaction. This leads to increased propene production, with the formation rate showing a direct relationship with the nitrogen content. The graphitic nitrogen species play a crucial role in improving the catalytic performance. The undoped CNTs display the lowest activity, while nitrogen-doped CNTs show superior activity. The morphological analysis reveals that nitrogen doping alters the structure of the carbon catalysts, resulting in a bamboo-like structure with interlinked compartments. This structure facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and enhances its activation, contributing to the improved catalytic activity. The distribution of nitrogen atoms within the carbon framework is uniform, and their presence does not alter the stability of the material significantly. The adsorption of oxygen is favored by nitrogen doping, which reduces the dependence on oxygen partial pressure and decreases the reaction order of oxygen. This mechanism differs from surface modifications or grafting with heteroatoms, expanding the understanding of carbon catalysis.

The enhanced catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the graphitic structure. These nitrogen atoms donate electrons to the graphitic lattice, introducing metallic or semiconductive features and narrowing the energy gap. This facilitates electron transfer from the carbon nanotube to adsorbed oxygen species, promoting the activation of oxygen. The nitrogen dopants speed up the dissociative adsorption of oxygen molecules and reduce the overall activation energy of the reaction. The presence of graphitic nitrogen species plays a pivotal role in improving the catalytic performance of the material. The enhancement in activity is observed with increasing nitrogen content, and the promotion effect of nitrogen doping differs from that of boron and phosphorus oxides, which suppress the catalytic activity. The mechanism involves the donation of electrons by the nitrogen atoms, which improves electron mobility and facilitates the dissociation of oxygen molecules, thus accelerating the reaction rate.
