[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
[4] "The new output has driven U.S. natural gas prices below $3.00 per million Btu for the first time in more than a decade."
[5] "At more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than five times as expensive as natural gas on an energy content basis."
[6] "PETROCHEMICAL facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."
[7] "The cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb."
[8] "The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb."
[9] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
[10] "Profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are now the highest they have been since 1988."

The shale boom has significantly influenced the North American petrochemical industry, leading to a shift in investment focus towards North America. Five major companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have announced plans for new complexes to manufacture ethylene and derivatives like ethylene oxide and polyethylene. This shift is largely attributed to the abundance of natural gas liquids (NGLs) sourced from shale, which has reduced the cost of ethylene production compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha. The cost advantage of NGLs over naphtha has led to an increase in ethylene production from ethane, with shale now accounting for more than one-quarter of US natural gas production. As a result, US natural gas prices have dropped below $3.00 per million Btu, while oil prices remain over five times more expensive on an energy content basis. This has encouraged the use of ethane as a primary feedstock for petrochemical facilities, enabling the production of ethylene and its derivatives at a lower cost. Consequently, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is approximately 18 cents per lb, whereas using light naphtha as a feedstock incurs a cost of about 46.5 cents per lb. The shift towards ethane has resulted in reduced production of coproducts such as propylene, butadiene, and aromatics. Despite this, the profitability of ethylene production has reached its highest level since 1988, indicating a strong rebound in the industry.

页岩革命极大地影响了北美石化行业，导致投资重点转向北美。五家主要公司——雪佛龙菲力浦化学、杜邦化学、福茂塑料、沙索和壳牌化学——宣布计划建立新的综合体，生产乙烯及其衍生物如乙二醇和聚乙烯。这种转变主要是由于从页岩中获取的天然气液体（NGLs）的丰富，降低了乙烯生产的成本，与传统的原料如石脑油相比。NGLs相对于石脑油的成本优势推动了从乙烷到乙烯的产量增加，页岩现在占美国天然气产量的四分之一以上。因此，美国天然气价格已降至每百万英制百万英里以下3美元，而石油价格仍比天然气高出五倍以上在能量含量的基础上。这鼓励使用乙烷作为主要原料，使得以较低成本生产乙烯及其衍生物成为可能。因此，从乙烷生产乙烯的现金成本约为每磅18美分，相比之下，使用轻质石脑油作为原料的成本约为每磅46.5美分。向乙烷的转变导致丙烯、丁二烯和芳香族等副产品的生产减少。尽管如此，乙烯生产的盈利能力达到了1988年以来的最高水平，表明行业出现了强劲反弹。
