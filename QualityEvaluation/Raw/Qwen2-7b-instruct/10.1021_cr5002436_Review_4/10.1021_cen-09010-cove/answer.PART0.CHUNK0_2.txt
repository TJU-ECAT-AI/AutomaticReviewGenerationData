[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Nearly every producer of ethylene or derivatives is contemplating expansions to take advantage of low raw material costs."
[4] "The new output has driven U.S. natural gas prices below $3.00 per million Btu for the first time in more than a decade."
[5] "At more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than five times as expensive as natural gas on an energy content basis."
[6] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."
[7] "The cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb."
[8] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
[9] "Profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are now the highest they have been since 1988."
[10] "Observers expect the growth in North American output to be similar this year to what it was in 2011."
[11] "North American firms will add about 8.4 million metric tons per year of new ethylene capacity by 2017, IHS' Stekla says, a 35% expansion of the region's output."

1. Executives are being encouraged to reinvest in North America due to the shale boom, which has significantly altered the landscape of the petrochemical industry.
2. Five major companies have announced plans for large-scale investments in North America, focusing on ethylene and derivative production.
3. Companies across the board are looking to expand their operations to capitalize on the low costs of raw materials provided by the shale boom.
4. The increased natural gas output has led to historically low prices, below $3.00 per million Btu, for the first time in over a decade.
5. The high cost of oil compared to natural gas, over $100 per barrel versus the natural gas price, highlights the economic benefits of the shale boom for North American producers.
6. Natural gas liquids, including ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons, are the primary feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities.
7. The cost of making ethylene from ethane is significantly lower (18 cents per lb) than from light naphtha (46.5 cents per lb).
8. Cracking ethane leads to reduced production of certain coproducts like propylene, butadiene, and aromatics, due to its lighter molecular weight.
9. The spot market for ethylene is experiencing record-high profit margins, surpassing levels seen since 1988.
10. Experts predict that the growth in North American petrochemical output will mirror that of 2011, with a similar pace of expansion expected this year.
11. By 2017, North American firms aim to increase their ethylene capacity by 8.4 million metric tons per year, representing a 35% expansion of regional production.

1. 管理层正在被鼓励重新投资北美，因为页岩革命彻底改变了石化行业的格局。
2. 五家主要公司宣布计划在北美进行大规模投资，重点关注乙烯及其衍生物的生产。
3. 全行业都在寻找机会扩大运营规模，利用页岩带来的低成本原材料优势。
4. 增加的天然气产量导致价格首次跌至每百万英制单位3美元以下，这是十年来的首次。
5. 油价超过每桶100美元，与天然气相比高出五倍以上，凸显了页岩革命对北美生产商的经济利好。
6. 北美化工设施的主要原料是从天然气中提取的液态烃混合物，包括乙烷、丙烷、丁烷和其他碳氢化合物。
7. 从乙烷制取乙烯的成本（每磅18美分）远低于使用轻质石脑油作为原料（每磅46.5美分）。
8. 裂解乙烷而不是更重的原料导致乙烯厂生产出的丙烯、丁二烯和芳香族化合物减少，由于其分子量较小。
9. 乙烯现货市场的利润现在达到了自1988年以来的最高水平。
10. 预测表明，今年北美化工产出的增长速度将与2011年相似，预计扩张速度将保持稳定。
11. 到2017年，北美企业计划将乙烯产能增加840万吨/年，代表区域产量增长35%。
