[1] "Executives are learning to invest in North America again."
[2] "Five companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have disclosed plans for new multi-billion-dollar complexes making ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene oxide and polyethylene."
[3] "Beyond large projects, nearly every producer of ethylene or derivatives is contemplating expansions to take advantage of low raw material costs."
[4] "Shale is also beginning to underpin chemical deals."
[5] "Executives are more than happy to change their outlook."
[6] "Until 2005, shale deposits...were an eccentric source of natural gas."
[7] "Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S."
[8] "At more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than five times as expensive as natural gas on an energy content basis."
[9] "Natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons, is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."
[10] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids."
[11] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to."
[12] "Cracking ethane has led to a decrease in the production of coproducts like propylene, butadiene, and aromatics."
[13] "Profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are now the highest they have been since 1988."
[14] "Observers expect the growth in North American output to be similar this year to what it was in 2011."
[15] "The rest of the world is still near the trough of the petrochemical business cycle."
[16] "Low natural gas prices have caused gas exploration companies to cut back on drilling."
[17] "The only thing that can meaningfully affect the drilling for gas liquids is if we get a sharp correction in oil prices."
[18] "Ethane oversupply is hitting the market from all this drilling."
[19] "With its success tied to petrochemical makers that buy natural gas liquids, the gas industry needs chemical companies to build more capacity."
[20] "Dow was the second company with a cracker announcement."
[21] "Eastman Chemicals oxo chemicals business has a large appetite for propylene."
[22] "Propylene is an important part of Dows plan."
[23] "Dow isn't alone."
[24] "Shell is also planning a cracker, but unlike the other projects, its plant is planned for the Northeast to tap into the Marcellus Shale."
[25] "Sasol is studying a cracker at its Lake Charles, La., complex that would have up to 1.4 million metric tons of capacity."
[26] "Nova is perhaps the most ambitious of these companies."
[27] "The longer Im in the industry, the less I believe in the cycle."

1. Executives are now willing to invest in North America again, reflecting a significant shift in their outlook.
2. Five major companies—Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical—have announced plans for substantial expansions in ethylene and derivative production, driven by the abundance of natural gas liquids in the region.
3. The majority of petrochemical companies are considering expansions to capitalize on the low cost of raw materials, influenced by the shale boom.
4. The shale boom has bolstered chemical deals, particularly in North America.
5. The executives are embracing this change with enthusiasm, demonstrating a positive attitude towards the new opportunities.
6. Prior to 2005, shale deposits were considered an unusual source of natural gas.
7. Since then, shale has emerged as a significant contributor to the natural gas production in the United States, accounting for over 25% of total output.
8. The price disparity between oil and natural gas is substantial, with oil being significantly more expensive per barrel compared to the energy content of natural gas.
9. Natural gas liquids, comprising ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons, are extracted from natural gas and subsequently separated into individual components.
10. For North American petrochemical facilities, natural gas liquids serve as the primary feedstock for production processes.
11. Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks results in reduced production of coproducts such as propylene, butadiene, and aromatics.
12. The profit margins for ethylene on the spot market are currently at their highest level since 1988.
13. The anticipated growth in North American output is expected to mirror the pace of 2011, maintaining a steady increase.
14. The global petrochemical industry is still experiencing a downturn, contrasting with the robust performance in North America.
15. The decline in drilling activities among gas exploration companies is a direct consequence of lower natural gas prices.
16. Any significant fluctuation in oil prices could potentially impact the drilling activities for gas liquids.
17. The oversupply of ethane in the market is a result of extensive drilling operations.
18. The gas industry relies on petrochemical manufacturers to increase capacity in order to capitalize on the growing demand for natural gas liquids.
19. Dow Chemical is the second company to announce a new ethylene cracker, following Chevron Phillips Chemical.
20. Eastman Chemicals' oxo chemicals division has a notable demand for propylene, as evidenced by its interest in expanding its production capabilities.
21. Propylene plays a crucial role in Dow's strategic planning, emphasizing its importance in the company's operations.
22. Other companies are also considering the construction of ethylene crackers, including Sasol and Shell, which are tapping into specific regional resources such as the Marcellus Shale.
23. Nova Chemicals is among the most proactive companies in exploring ways to increase its capacity and leverage the benefits of natural gas liquids.
24. Industry veterans like Gerd Lbbert acknowledge the shift in the industry's dynamics, suggesting a diminished belief in traditional cyclical patterns.
