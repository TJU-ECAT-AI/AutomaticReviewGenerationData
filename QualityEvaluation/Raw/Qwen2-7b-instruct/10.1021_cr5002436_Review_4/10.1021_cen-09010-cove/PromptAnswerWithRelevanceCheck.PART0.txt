COVER STORY
Experiences early in the previous decade taught the regions executives that their reliance on raw materials derived from natural gas to make ethylene put them at a cost disadvantage to the many other areas of the world that use petroleum-derived naphtha. Now ethane is so cheap that only the Middle East can produce ethylene more cost-effectively than North America can.

PETROCHEMICALS
CHEMICAL executives can be forgiven for having to get up to speed in short order.
Until 2005, shale depositswhich lie be neath a wide swath of the countrywere an eccentric source of natural gas. That was about the time that exploration com panies perfected horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques to liberate gas that was tightly locked into shale. Shale has since become the source of more than one-quarter of the natural gas produced in the U.S.

Stekla notes that profit margins for eth ylene on the spot market are now the high est they have been since 1988. Spot prices have been extremely high, even though demand is relatively tepid, he says.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The cost of producing ethylene from ethane in North America is significantly lower compared to using naphtha. This is due to the abundance and affordability of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, which has become a dominant source of natural gas in the US. As a result, ethylene producers in North America enjoy high profit margins, especially in comparison to European and Asian chemical producers who rely on more expensive petroleum-derived feedstocks. These favorable market conditions have led to an increase in investments and expansions within the North American petrochemical industry.

北美生产乙烯从乙烷的成本远低于使用石脑油。这是由于北美天然气液体，特别是乙烷的丰富和经济性成为天然气的主要来源。因此，北美乙烯生产商享有高额利润，尤其是在与依赖更昂贵石油衍生原料的欧洲和亚洲化学生产商相比时。这些有利的市场条件导致北美石化行业投资和扩张的增加。

The shale boom has significantly influenced the North American petrochemical industry, leading to a shift in investment focus towards North America. Five major companies - Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemical, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell Chemical - have announced plans for new complexes to manufacture ethylene and derivatives like ethylene oxide and polyethylene. This shift is largely attributed to the abundance of natural gas liquids (NGLs) sourced from shale, which has reduced the cost of ethylene production compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha. The cost advantage of NGLs over naphtha has led to an increase in ethylene production from ethane, with shale now accounting for more than one-quarter of US natural gas production. As a result, US natural gas prices have dropped below $3.00 per million Btu, while oil prices remain over five times more expensive on an energy content basis. This has encouraged the use of ethane as a primary feedstock for petrochemical facilities, enabling the production of ethylene and its derivatives at a lower cost. Consequently, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is approximately 18 cents per lb, whereas using light naphtha as a feedstock incurs a cost of about 46.5 cents per lb. The shift towards ethane has resulted in reduced production of coproducts such as propylene, butadiene, and aromatics. Despite this, the profitability of ethylene production has reached its highest level since 1988, indicating a strong rebound in the industry.

页岩革命极大地影响了北美石化行业，导致投资重点转向北美。五家主要公司——雪佛龙菲力浦化学、杜邦化学、福茂塑料、沙索和壳牌化学——宣布计划建立新的综合体，生产乙烯及其衍生物如乙二醇和聚乙烯。这种转变主要是由于从页岩中获取的天然气液体（NGLs）的丰富，降低了乙烯生产的成本，与传统的原料如石脑油相比。NGLs相对于石脑油的成本优势推动了从乙烷到乙烯的产量增加，页岩现在占美国天然气产量的四分之一以上。因此，美国天然气价格已降至每百万英制百万英里以下3美元，而石油价格仍比天然气高出五倍以上在能量含量的基础上。这鼓励使用乙烷作为主要原料，使得以较低成本生产乙烯及其衍生物成为可能。因此，从乙烷生产乙烯的现金成本约为每磅18美分，相比之下，使用轻质石脑油作为原料的成本约为每磅46.5美分。向乙烷的转变导致丙烯、丁二烯和芳香族等副产品的生产减少。尽管如此，乙烯生产的盈利能力达到了1988年以来的最高水平，表明行业出现了强劲反弹。
