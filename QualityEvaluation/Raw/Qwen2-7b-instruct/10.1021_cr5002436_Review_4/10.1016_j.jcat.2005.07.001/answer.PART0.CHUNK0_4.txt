[1] "Balanced acidic and redox properties are indispensable for an efficient conversion of NOx, that is, high activity and selectivity (over a broad temperature window)."
[2] "Indium oxide is easily reduced, at a reduction temperature related to particle size. For smaller particles, the reduction begins around 200 C."
[3] "The crystalline structure of the In2O3 phase observed on the high-In-loading catalysts is not associated with high de-NOx activity, whereas small In2O3 aggregates well dispersed over the alumina support are active and selective in NOx reduction."
[4] "A balanced presence of indium and alumina sites indeed seems to be very important for achieving optimal catalytic performance over this type of catalyst, confirming the first results published in the literature concerning the characterization and catalytic performance of In2O3/Al2O3 systems in NOx reduction."

1. Balanced acidic and redox properties are crucial for efficient NOx conversion, ensuring both high activity and selectivity across a wide temperature range.
2. Indium oxide reduces at a temperature related to its particle size, with smaller particles beginning reduction around 200 C.
3. The crystalline structure of the indium oxide phase on high-indium-loading catalysts doesn't correlate with high de-NOx activity, while small, well-dispersed indium oxide aggregates show activity and selectivity in NOx reduction.
4. A balanced distribution of indium and alumina sites appears essential for achieving optimal catalytic performance in this type of catalyst, validating earlier findings on indium oxide/alumina systems for NOx reduction.

1. 平衡的酸性和还原性性质对于有效转换NOx至关重要，确保在宽温度范围内具有高活性和选择性。
2. 碱式氧化铟在粒子大小相关的温度下容易还原，较小的粒子开始在约200°C进行还原。
3. 高indium负载催化剂上的indium氧化物相的结晶结构与高de-NOx活性无关，而小而均匀分散的indium氧化物团簇在NOx减少中显示出活性和选择性。
4. indium和氧化铝位点的平衡分布似乎对于实现这种催化剂的最优催化性能至关重要，验证了关于indium氧化物/氧化铝系统在NOx减少中的表征和催化性能的早期发现。
