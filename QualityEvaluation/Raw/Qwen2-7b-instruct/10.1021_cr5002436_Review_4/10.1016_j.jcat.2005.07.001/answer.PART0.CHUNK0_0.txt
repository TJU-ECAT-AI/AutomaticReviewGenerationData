[1] "The deposition of indium oxide slightly decreases the acidic properties of alumina, but the amounts of ammonia adsorbed per m2 of catalyst surface area do not vary significantly."
[2] "Indium oxide deposition has a greater influence on the adsorption of acidic molecules; the adsorbed amount of SO2 is related to the indium oxide surface content, not to the total deposited amount."
[3] "These findings suggest that indium oxide can be considered more basic than acidic."
[4] "Indium oxide is easily reduced, at a reduction temperature related to particle size."
[5] "For smaller particles, the reduction begins around 200 C."
[6] "The reoxidation process starts at lower temperatures than the reduction process."
[7] "Balanced acidic and redox properties are indispensable for an efficient conversion of NOx, that is, high activity and selectivity (over a broad temperature window)."

The literature provides insights into the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Carbon materials like coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons can exhibit catalytic activity due to their unique surface chemistry, porosity, and electronic properties. The mechanisms behind this activity often involve the promotion of alkane breaking into reactive intermediates, which can then undergo further transformations. Factors influencing this activity include temperature, surface area, pore structure, and the presence of active sites on the material's surface.

The literature highlights that the surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of carbon materials. For instance, the presence of functional groups like oxygenated groups can enhance the reactivity of the material towards alkane molecules. Additionally, the porosity of the carbon material allows for better access of alkane molecules to the active sites, facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

Temperature is another critical factor that affects the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials. At elevated temperatures, the activation energy for the dehydrogenation reaction decreases, leading to faster reaction kinetics. However, excessively high temperatures can also lead to material degradation, reducing the catalytic efficiency.

The literature also discusses the importance of balancing the acidic and redox properties of the catalyst for efficient alkane dehydrogenation. Catalysts with a combination of acidic sites for alkane activation and redox-active sites for hydrogen transfer can achieve high activity and selectivity across a wide range of temperatures.

Overall, the literature emphasizes the potential of carbon-based materials as efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation due to their tunable surface chemistry, high surface area, and ability to maintain activity under various operating conditions.
