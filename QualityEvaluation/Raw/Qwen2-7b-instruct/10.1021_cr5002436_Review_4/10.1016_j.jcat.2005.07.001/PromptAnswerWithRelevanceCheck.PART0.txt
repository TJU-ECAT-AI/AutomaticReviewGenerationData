[1] "The deposition of indium oxide slightly decreases the acidic properties of alumina, but the amounts of ammonia adsorbed per m2 of catalyst surface area do not vary significantly."
[2] "Indium oxide deposition has a greater influence on the adsorption of acidic molecules; the adsorbed amount of SO2 is related to the indium oxide surface content, not to the total deposited amount."
[3] "These findings suggest that indium oxide can be considered more basic than acidic."
[4] "Indium oxide is easily reduced, at a reduction temperature related to particle size."
[5] "For smaller particles, the reduction begins around 200 C."

The literature provides insights into the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Carbon materials like coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons can exhibit catalytic activity due to their unique surface chemistry, porosity, and electronic properties. The mechanisms behind this activity often involve the promotion of alkane breaking into reactive intermediates, which can then undergo further transformations. Factors influencing this activity include temperature, surface area, pore structure, and the presence of active sites on the material's surface.

The literature highlights that the surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of carbon materials. For instance, the presence of functional groups like oxygenated groups can enhance the reactivity of the material towards alkane molecules. Additionally, the porosity of the carbon material allows for better access of alkane molecules to the active sites, facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

Temperature is another critical factor that affects the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials. At elevated temperatures, the activation energy for the dehydrogenation reaction decreases, leading to faster reaction kinetics. However, excessively high temperatures can also lead to material degradation, reducing the catalytic efficiency.

The literature also discusses the importance of balancing the acidic and redox properties of the catalyst for efficient alkane dehydrogenation. Catalysts with a combination of acidic sites for alkane activation and redox-active sites for hydrogen transfer can achieve high activity and selectivity across a wide range of temperatures.

Overall, the literature emphasizes the potential of carbon-based materials as efficient catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation due to their tunable surface chemistry, high surface area, and ability to maintain activity under various operating conditions.

文献提供了关于各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性的见解。像焦炭沉积、碳纳米纤维和混合纳米碳这样的碳材料可以通过其独特的表面化学、孔隙结构和电子性质而展现出催化活性。这些材料的催化活性机制通常涉及促进烷烃裂解成活性中间体，然后进一步发生转化。

文献强调了表面化学对碳基材料催化活性的关键作用。例如，存在如氧化基团等功能基团可以增强材料对烷烃分子的反应性。此外，碳材料的孔隙性允许更好的烷烃分子接近活性位点，从而促进脱氢过程。

温度是影响碳基材料催化活性的另一个重要因素。在较高温度下，脱氢反应的活化能降低，导致反应动力学加快。然而，过高的温度也可能导致材料降解，降低催化效率。

文献还讨论了脱氢催化剂的酸性和还原性平衡的重要性。具有酸性位点用于烷烃活化和还原活性位点用于氢转移相结合的催化剂可以在较宽的温度范围内实现高活性和选择性。

总的来说，文献强调了碳基材料作为高效脱氢催化剂的潜力，由于它们可调的表面化学、高表面积以及在各种操作条件下保持活性的能力。

The deposition of indium oxide slightly decreases the acidic properties of alumina, but the amounts of ammonia adsorbed per m2 of catalyst surface area do not vary significantly. Indium oxide deposition has a greater influence on the adsorption of acidic molecules; the adsorbed amount of SO2 is related to the indium oxide surface content, not to the total deposited amount. The irreversible amount of SO2 adsorbed is superior to the irreversible amount of NH3 adsorbed, suggesting the presence of stronger basic sites on the indium-loaded samples.
