[1] "Indium oxide deposition slightly decreases the acidic properties of alumina, but the amounts of ammonia adsorbed per m2 of catalyst surface area do not vary significantly."
[2] "Indium oxide deposition has a greater influence on the adsorption of acidic molecules; the adsorbed amount of SO2 is related to the indium oxide surface content, not to the total deposited amount."
[3] "These findings suggest that indium oxide can be considered more basic than acidic."
[4] "Indium oxide is easily reduced, at a reduction temperature related to particle size. For smaller particles, the reduction begins around 200 C."
[5] "The reoxidation process starts at lower temperatures than the reduction process."
[6] "Balanced acidic and redox properties are indispensable for an efficient conversion of NOx, that is, high activity and selectivity (over a broad temperature window)."

1. Indium oxide slightly reduces the acidic properties of alumina, but the ammonia adsorption per m2 of catalyst surface area remains largely unchanged.
2. Indium oxide has a greater impact on the adsorption of acidic molecules. The amount of SO2 adsorbed correlates with the surface content of indium oxide, not the total amount deposited.
3. Indium oxide is perceived as more basic than acidic.
4. Indium oxide undergoes reduction at a temperature linked to particle size, with smaller particles undergoing reduction around 200°C.
5. The reoxidation process initiates at lower temperatures compared to the reduction process.
6. Balanced acidic and redox properties are crucial for the efficient conversion of NOx, ensuring both high activity and selectivity across a wide temperature range.

1. 铟氧化物略微降低了氧化铝的酸性特性，但每平方米催化剂表面区域吸附的氨量并未显著变化。
2. 铟氧化物对吸附酸性分子的影响更大。二氧化硫的吸附量与铟氧化物的表面含量相关，而非总沉积量。
3. 铟氧化物被认为比酸性更强。
4. 铟氧化物在与其颗粒大小相关的温度下被还原，小颗粒在约200°C开始还原。
5. 重新氧化过程的启动温度低于还原过程。
6. 平衡的酸性和还原性质对于NOx的有效转换至关重要，确保了在较宽温度范围内高活性和选择性。
