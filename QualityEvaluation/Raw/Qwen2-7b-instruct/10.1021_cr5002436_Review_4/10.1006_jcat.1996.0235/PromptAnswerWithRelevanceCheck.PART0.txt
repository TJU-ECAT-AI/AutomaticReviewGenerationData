How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?

The zinc titanate films prepared via MOD consisted of irregularly shaped grains.
The Zn/Ti ratio of the film surface as measured with XPS was slightly higher than that of the bulk, indicating some zinc enrichment on the surface.
GIXRD showed the existence of the same zinc titanate phases at all film depths, again indicating a homogeneous film.
Catalytic testing of these films in isobutane dehydrogenation showed a clear correlation between the structure and the catalytic performance.
Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure were active for dehydrogenation, but the other phases were not.
The most active catalyst has a Zn/Ti ratio close to 2, the stoichiometry of which corresponds to the Zn2TiO4 phase.
The highest selectivity to isobutene was ca. 90 mol%, both at 823 and 923 K. 
The isobutane conversion was 2 and 8 mol%, respectively, at these two temperatures.
Compared with the catalytic performance of a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material, the thin film catalyst exhibited a higher activity and a remarkably better stability.

The study demonstrates that zinc titanate thin films with specific compositions and structures show enhanced catalytic performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The most active catalyst has a Zn/Ti ratio close to 2, corresponding to the Zn2TiO4 phase, which exhibits a cubic crystal structure. This phase is active for dehydrogenation, whereas other phases are inactive. The thin film catalyst shows higher activity and better stability compared to a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material. The catalytic performance correlates with the structure of the zinc titanate phases, highlighting the importance of both composition and structure in determining catalytic efficiency.

The dehydrogenation of isobutane over zinc titanate thin film catalysts shows that the structure significantly influences catalytic performance. Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure are active for dehydrogenation, while other phases are not. High selectivity to isobutene reaches approximately 90 mol% at temperatures of 823 and 923 K. The isobutane conversion rates at these temperatures are 2 and 8 mol%, respectively. Moreover, zinc titanate thin film catalysts demonstrate higher activity and better stability compared to pellets pressed from powder material.
