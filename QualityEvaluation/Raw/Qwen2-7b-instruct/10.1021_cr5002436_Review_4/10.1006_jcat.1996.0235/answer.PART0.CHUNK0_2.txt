[1] "The zinc titanate films prepared via MOD consisted of irregularly shaped grains."
[2] "The Zn/Ti ratio of the film surface as measured with XPS was slightly higher than that of the bulk, indicating some zinc enrichment on the surface."
[3] "GIXRD showed the existence of the same zinc titanate phases at all film depths, again indicating a homogeneous film."
[4] "Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure were active for dehydrogenation, but the other phases were not."
[5] "The highest selectivity to isobutene was ca. 90 mol%, both at 823 and 923 K. The isobutane conversion was 2 and 8 mol%, respectively, at these two temperatures."
[6] "Compared with the catalytic performance of a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material, the thin film catalyst exhibited a higher activity and a remarkably better stability."

The document discusses the preparation and characterization of zinc titanate thin films with varying Zn/Ti ratios. These films were evaluated for their catalytic performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The key findings regarding the activity of zinc titanate in this context are as follows: 

1. Films with a cubic crystal structure showed high activity in isobutane dehydrogenation, while other phases were inactive.
2. The highest selectivity for isobutene production reached approximately 90 mol%, with corresponding isobutane conversion rates of 2 and 8 mol% at 823 and 923 K, respectively.
3. The thin film catalyst demonstrated higher activity and greater stability compared to a traditional zinc titanate pellet made from powder material.

文献讨论了通过金属有机分解（MOD）技术制备的不同Zn/Ti比例的锌钛酸盐薄膜。这些薄膜被评估用于异丁烷脱氢反应的催化性能。在这一背景下，锌钛酸盐的活性关键发现如下：

1. 具有立方晶格结构的薄膜在异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性，而其他相则不活跃。
2. 最高的异丁烯选择性达到约90摩尔%，对应于在823和923 K时的异丁烷转化率分别为2和8摩尔%。
3. 薄膜催化剂与从粉末材料压制成的传统锌钛酸盐颗粒相比，显示出更高的活性和更好的稳定性。
