The zinc titanate films prepared via MOD consisted of irregularly shaped grains.
The Zn/Ti ratio of the film surface as measured with XPS was slightly higher than that of the bulk, indicating some zinc enrichment on the surface.
GIXRD showed the existence of the same zinc titanate phases at all film depths, again indicating a homogeneous film.
Catalytic testing of these films in isobutane dehydrogenation showed a clear correlation between the structure and the catalytic performance.
Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure were active for dehydrogenation, but the other phases were not.
The most active catalyst has a Zn/Ti ratio close to 2, the stoichiometry of which corresponds to the Zn2TiO4 phase.
The highest selectivity to isobutene was ca. 90 mol%, both at 823 and 923 K. 
The isobutane conversion was 2 and 8 mol%, respectively, at these two temperatures.
Compared with the catalytic performance of a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material, the thin film catalyst exhibited a higher activity and a remarkably better stability.

The study demonstrates that zinc titanate thin films with specific compositions and structures show enhanced catalytic performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The most active catalyst has a Zn/Ti ratio close to 2, corresponding to the Zn2TiO4 phase, which exhibits a cubic crystal structure. This phase is active for dehydrogenation, whereas other phases are inactive. The thin film catalyst shows higher activity and better stability compared to a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material. The catalytic performance correlates with the structure of the zinc titanate phases, highlighting the importance of both composition and structure in determining catalytic efficiency.
