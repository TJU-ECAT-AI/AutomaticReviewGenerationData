[1] "The catalytic performance of these zinc titanate thin films in isobutane dehydrogenation was studied in a newly designed and built wafer reactor in the pulse mode."
[2] "Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure were active for dehydrogenation, but the other phases were not."
[3] "The most active catalyst has a Zn/Ti ratio close to 2, the stoichiometry of which corresponds to the Zn2TiO4 phase."
[4] "The highest selectivity to isobutene was ca. 90 mol%, both at 823 and 923 K. The isobutane conversion was 2 and 8 mol%, respectively, at these two temperatures."
[5] "Compared with the catalytic performance of a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material, the thin film catalyst exhibited a higher activity and a remarkably better stability."

The scientific literature focuses on the study of zinc titanate thin films as catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation. These films, with a cubic crystal structure, demonstrated high activity and selectivity in the reaction, achieving up to 90 mol% selectivity to isobutene at temperatures of 823 and 923 K. Moreover, they showed a significantly higher catalytic activity and better stability compared to pellets made from the same material.
