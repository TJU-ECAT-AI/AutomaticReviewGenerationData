[1] "The catalytic performance of these zinc titanate thin films in isobutane dehydrogenation was studied in a newly designed and built wafer reactor in the pulse mode."
[2] "Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure were active for dehydrogenation, but the other phases were not."
[3] "The most active catalyst has a Zn/Ti ratio close to 2, the stoichiometry of which corresponds to the Zn2TiO4 phase."
[4] "The highest selectivity to isobutene was ca. 90 mol%, both at 823 and 923 K. The isobutane conversion was 2 and 8 mol%, respectively, at these two temperatures."
[5] "Compared with the catalytic performance of a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material, the thin film catalyst exhibited a higher activity and a remarkably better stability."

The study examined zinc titanate thin films as catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation. The films, with a Zn/Ti ratio around 2, showed the highest activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation, with a selectivity of approximately 90 mol% and conversions of 2 and 8 mol% at temperatures of 823 and 923 K, respectively. These films also demonstrated superior activity and stability compared to pellets made from powdered zinc titanate.
