[1] "The zinc titanate films prepared via MOD consisted of irregularly shaped grains."
[2] "The Zn/Ti ratio of the film surface as measured with XPS was slightly higher than that of the bulk, indicating some zinc enrichment on the surface."
[3] "Catalytic testing of these films in isobutane dehydrogenation showed a clear correlation between the structure and the catalytic performance."
[4] "Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure were active for dehydrogenation, but the other phases were not."
[5] "The highest selectivity to isobutene was ca. 90 mol%, both at 823 and 923 K."
[6] "The isobutane conversion was 2 and 8 mol%, respectively, at these two temperatures."
[7] "Compared with the catalytic performance of a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material, the thin film catalyst exhibited a higher activity and a remarkably better stability."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The dehydrogenation of isobutane over zinc titanate thin film catalysts shows that the structure significantly influences catalytic performance. Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure are active for dehydrogenation, while other phases are not. High selectivity to isobutene reaches approximately 90 mol% at temperatures of 823 and 923 K. The isobutane conversion rates at these temperatures are 2 and 8 mol%, respectively. Moreover, zinc titanate thin film catalysts demonstrate higher activity and better stability compared to pellets pressed from powder material.

在锌钛酸盐薄膜催化剂上进行异丁烷脱氢反应，结构对催化性能有着显著影响。具有立方晶格结构的锌钛酸盐相对于脱氢是活性的，而其他相则不是。在823和923 K的温度下，选择性达到约90摩尔%，异丁烷转化率分别为2和8摩尔%。此外，锌钛酸盐薄膜催化剂在活性和稳定性方面均优于由粉末材料压制而成的颗粒催化剂。
