            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/jp065911v]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/cs200441e], [10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b03939.s001], and [10.1021/cs5000944]. The investigation into the unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials, such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, in alkane dehydrogenation reactions reveals intriguing mechanisms. These materials demonstrate catalytic activity due to the formation of active sites on their surfaces, influenced by factors such as temperature and surface chemistry. The high surface area and porosity of these materials contribute to their ability to facilitate rapid reaction kinetics, making them promising candidates for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. This discovery holds significant promise for enhancing the selectivity and yield of dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable petrochemical feedstocks.
