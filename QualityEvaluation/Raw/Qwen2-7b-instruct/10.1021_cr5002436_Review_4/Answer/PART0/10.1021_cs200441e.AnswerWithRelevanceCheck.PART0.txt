          Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to the presence of Zn clusters. These clusters form Zn-based intermediates that facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Temperature and surface chemistry significantly influence the efficiency of these catalytic activities. This discovery holds great promise for developing novel and highly effective carbon-based catalysts.
