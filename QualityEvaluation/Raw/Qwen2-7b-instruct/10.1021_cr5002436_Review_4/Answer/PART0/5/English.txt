Carbon-based materials, such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic structure and surface chemistry, which facilitates the activation of alkane molecules. Temperature and surface chemistry are critical factors affecting the efficiency of these materials as catalysts. This phenomenon has significant implications for the development of new and efficient carbon-based catalysts, potentially driving progress in chemical synthesis and energy conversion technologies.
