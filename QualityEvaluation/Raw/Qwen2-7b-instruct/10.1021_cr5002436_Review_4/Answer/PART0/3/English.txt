Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, display unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their unique structure and surface chemistry, which provides a large surface area and specific functional groups. Temperature significantly affects the activation of these materials, boosting their catalytic efficiency. Surface chemistry, particularly the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, also greatly impacts their performance. This phenomenon has important implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts, especially in industries like petrochemical processes.
