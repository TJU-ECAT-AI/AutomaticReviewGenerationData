[2] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
[3] "The main pathway for aromatization, at least over protonic catalysts, probably involves C8 first the formation of an unsaturated carbenium ion (protonated di-olefin) by hydride abstraction from a monolefin, followed by cyclization via internal electrophilic attack."
[4] "Over ZSM-5-Zn only a small proportion of methane is formed distinguishing it from the reaction over ZSM-5-H and silicalite. This leads to the conclusion that a radical-chain mechanism probably does not make a significant contribution to propane conversion over ZSM-5-Zn."
[5] "As pointed out in the previous discussion, aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."

1. The BTX selectivity over ZSM-5-H decreases with increasing space velocity, whereas it increases slightly over ZSM-5-Zn. The conversion mechanism involves dehydrogenation of propane followed by oligomerization and aromatization. The aromatization pathway likely starts with the formation of an unsaturated carbenium ion from a monolefin, which then undergoes cyclization via internal electrophilic attack. Over ZSM-5-Zn, aromatization generates hydrogen instead of paraffins, unlike the hydrogen transfer mechanism occurring over ZSM-5-H. A radical-chain mechanism does not significantly contribute to propane conversion over ZSM-5-Zn.

1. ZSM-5-H的BTX选择性随空间速度的增加而降低，而ZSM-5-Zn的BTX选择性略有增加。转换机制涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是多聚化和芳构化。芳构化途径可能从单烯烃的氢原子抽象开始，然后通过内部亲电攻击进行环化。在ZSM-5-Zn上，芳构化产生氢气而不是烷烃，这与在ZSM-5-H上发生的氢转移机制不同。自由基链机制对ZSM-5-Zn上的丙烷转换贡献不大。

The literature discusses the study of ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, specifically focusing on the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons. The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite were utilized in these studies. The conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons was observed to increase with increasing reaction temperature, and the proportion of BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) increased with temperature. The BTX selectivity was higher for ZSM-5-Zn compared to ZSM-5-H, especially with changes in space velocity. The conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation followed by oligomerization and aromatization. The zinc-exchanged catalysts showed enhanced levels of C2 products from propane, particularly over ZSM-5-H. Hydrogen had a specific effect on the level of propane conversion and BTX content over ZSM-5-Zn, reducing both. The behavior of the BTX selectivity with space velocity was different over ZSM-5-Zn compared to ZSM-5-H, influenced by the equilibrium of dehydrogenation processes.

文献讨论了ZSM-5沸石催化剂的研究，特别关注丙烷转化为芳香烃的过程。ZSM-5-Zn（锌交换）和ZSM-5-H（质子交换）形式的ZSM-5沸石被用作研究对象。在730-820 K的温度范围内，观察到丙烷转化为芳香烃的转化率随着反应温度的升高而增加，并且BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）的比例也随温度升高而增加。ZSM-5-Zn的BTX选择性高于ZSM-5-H，尤其是在空间速度变化时。转化机制涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是多聚化和芳构化。锌交换催化剂显示出从丙烷中产生更高水平的C2产物，尤其是相对于ZSM-5-H。氢对ZSM-5-Zn的丙烷转化率和BTX含量有特定的影响，两者都减少了。ZSM-5-Zn的BTX选择性与空间速度的行为与ZSM-5-H不同，这是由脱氢平衡过程的等效性所影响的，受到氢扩散速率的影响。

The study investigates the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons using ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts in the temperature range of 730-820 K. Among the forms studied, ZSM-5-Zn showed higher activity and better BTX selectivity, with a range of 60-70%. As the temperature increased, both propane conversion and the proportion of BTX increased, with the trend being more pronounced in ZSM-5-Zn. Catalysts deactivated slowly, causing a conversion decrease at a rate of 4-85% per hour. The conversion mechanism includes propane dehydrogenation followed by oligomerization and aromatization. ZSM-5-Zn and ZSM-5-H were found to be more active than their protonated counterparts.
