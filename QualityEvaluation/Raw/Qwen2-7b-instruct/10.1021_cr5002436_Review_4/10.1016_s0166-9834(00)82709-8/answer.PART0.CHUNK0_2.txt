[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."
[2] "Over ZSM-5-H the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, while over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
[4] "The ZSM-5-Zn catalysts studied had aluminium contents ranging from 0.71 to 2.32 wt%. The conversion of propane and the nature of the product distributions were approximately independent of aluminium content in the range 1.28-2.32 wt%."
[5] "With both catalysts,as expected, the propane conversion fell with increasing space velocity but the product distributions behaved differently."
[6] "The ZSM-5-Zn catalysts showed enhanced levels of C2 production from propane, particularly over ZSM-5-H."
[7] "In the case of ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, hydrogen was found to have a specific effect on both the level of propane conversion and on the BTX content of the products (both reduced)."

The literature discusses the study of ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, specifically focusing on the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons. The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite were utilized in these studies. The conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons was observed to increase with increasing reaction temperature, and the proportion of BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) increased with temperature. The BTX selectivity was higher for ZSM-5-Zn compared to ZSM-5-H, especially with changes in space velocity. The conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation followed by oligomerization and aromatization. The zinc-exchanged catalysts showed enhanced levels of C2 products from propane, particularly over ZSM-5-H. Hydrogen had a specific effect on the level of propane conversion and BTX content over ZSM-5-Zn, reducing both. The behavior of the BTX selectivity with space velocity was different over ZSM-5-Zn compared to ZSM-5-H, influenced by the equilibrium of dehydrogenation processes.

文献讨论了ZSM-5沸石催化剂的研究，特别关注丙烷转化为芳香烃的过程。ZSM-5-Zn（锌交换）和ZSM-5-H（质子交换）形式的ZSM-5沸石被用作研究对象。在730-820 K的温度范围内，观察到丙烷转化为芳香烃的转化率随着反应温度的升高而增加，并且BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）的比例也随温度升高而增加。ZSM-5-Zn的BTX选择性高于ZSM-5-H，尤其是在空间速度变化时。转化机制涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是多聚化和芳构化。锌交换催化剂显示出从丙烷中产生更高水平的C2产物，尤其是相对于ZSM-5-H。氢对ZSM-5-Zn的丙烷转化率和BTX含量有特定的影响，两者都减少了。ZSM-5-Zn的BTX选择性与空间速度的行为与ZSM-5-H不同，这是由脱氢平衡过程的等效性所影响的，受到氢扩散速率的影响。
