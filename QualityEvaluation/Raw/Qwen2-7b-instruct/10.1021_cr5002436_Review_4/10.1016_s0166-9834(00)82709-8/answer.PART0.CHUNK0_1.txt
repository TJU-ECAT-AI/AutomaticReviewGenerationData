[4] "Over ZSM-5-Zn only a small proportion of methane is formed distinguishing it from the reaction over ZSM-5-H and silicalite. This leads to the conclusion that a radical-chain mechanism probably does not make a significant contribution to propane conversion over ZSM-5-Zn."
[5] "As pointed out in the previous discussion, aromatization on ZSM-5-Zn generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins)."

1. The BTX selectivity over ZSM-5-H decreases with increasing space velocity, whereas it increases slightly over ZSM-5-Zn. The conversion mechanism involves dehydrogenation of propane followed by oligomerization and aromatization. The aromatization pathway likely starts with the formation of an unsaturated carbenium ion from a monolefin, which then undergoes cyclization via internal electrophilic attack. Over ZSM-5-Zn, aromatization generates hydrogen instead of paraffins, unlike the hydrogen transfer mechanism occurring over ZSM-5-H. A radical-chain mechanism does not significantly contribute to propane conversion over ZSM-5-Zn.

1. ZSM-5-H的BTX选择性随空间速度的增加而降低，而ZSM-5-Zn的BTX选择性略有增加。转换机制涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是多聚化和芳构化。芳构化途径可能从单烯烃的氢原子抽象开始，然后通过内部亲电攻击进行环化。在ZSM-5-Zn上，芳构化产生氢气而不是烷烃，这与在ZSM-5-H上发生的氢转移机制不同。自由基链机制对ZSM-5-Zn上的丙烷转换贡献不大。
