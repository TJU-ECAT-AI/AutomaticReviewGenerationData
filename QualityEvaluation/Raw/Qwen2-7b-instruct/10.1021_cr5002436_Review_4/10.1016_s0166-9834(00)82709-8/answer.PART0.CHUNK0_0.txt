[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."
[2] "Over ZSM-5-H the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, while over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization."
[4] "In the reaction over ZSM-5-H the proportions of all the aromatic products (BTX,benzenoid Cg+, naphthalenes) decreased with increasing space velocity, while the proportion of Cl,2 products increased."
[5] "In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen)."
[6] "We suggest that hydrogen was found to have a specific effect on both the level of propane conversion and on the BTX content of the products (both reduced)."

1. The study investigated the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons using the zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite at temperatures ranging from 730 to 820 K.
2. The BTX selectivity over ZSM-5-H decreased as space velocity increased, whereas over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity showed a slight increase.
3. The conversion mechanism involves dehydrogenation of propane, followed by oligomerization and aromatization.
4. In the reaction over ZSM-5-H, the proportions of aromatic products like BTX, benzenoid Cg+, and naphthalenes decreased with increasing space velocity, while the proportion of Cl,2 products increased.
5. Zinc cations in the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst are suggested to act as hydride acceptors, forming transient [Zn-HI+ species, which is believed to aid in the dehydrogenation process.
6. Hydrogen was found to reduce both the propane conversion level and the BTX content of the products.

1. 研究使用了交换为锌(ZSM-5-Zn)和质子交换(ZSM-5-H)形式的ZSM-5沸石，研究了在730至820 K的温度范围内丙烷转化为芳香烃的情况。
2. 在ZSM-5-H催化剂上，随着空速的增加，BTX选择性下降，而在ZSM-5-Zn催化剂上，BTX选择性略有增加。
3. 转化机制包括丙烷脱氢、多聚化和芳构化。
4. 在ZSM-5-H催化剂上，随着空速的增加，所有芳香族产品的比例（如BTX、苯环Cg+和萘）减少，而Cl,2产品的比例增加。
5. ZSM-5-Zn催化剂中的锌离子被建议作为氢接受体，形成暂态[Zn-HI+物种，这被认为有助于脱氢过程。
6. 氢气被发现可以降低丙烷转化水平和BTX产物的含量。
