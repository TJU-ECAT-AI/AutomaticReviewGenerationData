The study investigates the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons using ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts in the temperature range of 730-820 K. Among the forms studied, ZSM-5-Zn showed higher activity and better BTX selectivity, with a range of 60-70%. As the temperature increased, both propane conversion and the proportion of BTX increased, with the trend being more pronounced in ZSM-5-Zn. Catalysts deactivated slowly, causing a conversion decrease at a rate of 4-85% per hour. The conversion mechanism includes propane dehydrogenation followed by oligomerization and aromatization. ZSM-5-Zn and ZSM-5-H were found to be more active than their protonated counterparts.

研究在730-820 K的温度范围内考察了ZSM-5沸石催化剂对丙烷转化为芳香烃的转换。其中，ZSM-5-Zn的活性更高且BTX选择性更好，范围为60-70%。随着温度的升高，丙烷转化率和BTX的比例都增加，ZSM-5-Zn的趋势更为明显。催化剂缓慢失活，导致每小时转化率下降4-85%。转换机制包括丙烷脱氢、多聚化和芳构化。ZSM-5-Zn和ZSM-5-H被发现比其质子化形式更活跃。

The ZSM-5-Zn catalysts had aluminum contents ranging from 0.71 to 2.32 wt%. In all cases, the propane conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature, and Figure 3 presents detailed data for the temperature dependence of conversion and product distribution over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts with 1.28 wt% aluminum content. The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions, were as follows: ZSM-5-Zn (1.28 wt% aluminum), 121±15 kJ mol-1; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminum), 104±15 kJ mol-1; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminum), 120±15 kJ mol-1.
