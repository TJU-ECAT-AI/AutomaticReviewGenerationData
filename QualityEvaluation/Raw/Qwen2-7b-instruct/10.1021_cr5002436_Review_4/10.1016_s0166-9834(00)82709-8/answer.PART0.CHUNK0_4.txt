1. The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite were studied for converting propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures ranging from 730 to 820 K. ZSM-5-Zn showed higher activity and better BTX selectivity, with a range of 60-70%.

2. Propane conversion over ZSM-5 catalysts decreases with increasing space velocity, as expected. However, the behavior of product distributions differs between the ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts.

3. In the reaction over ZSM-5-H, the proportions of aromatic products (BTX, benzenoid Cg+, naphthalenes) decrease with increasing space velocity, whereas the proportion of C,,2 products increases.

4. Conversely, over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity shows a slight increase with rising space velocity, while the components of benzenoid Cg+ and naphthalenes decrease. 

5. The fraction of ethylene in the C2 fraction tends to rise and the fraction of ethane decreases as the space velocity increases, with this pattern observed in both catalysts.

6. Propane conversion improves with increasing reaction temperature for both catalysts.

7. At a low space velocity, ZSM-5-H gave a higher proportion of methane and ethylene compared to ZSM-5-Zn.

8. The composition of the C,,2 products varies with space velocity over both catalysts.

1. 研究了锌交换(ZSM-5-Zn)和质子交换(ZSM-5-H)形式的ZSM-5沸石在730至820 K的温度范围内将丙烷转化为芳香烃的情况。ZSM-5-Zn的活性更高，BTX选择性更好，范围为60-70%。

2. 在ZSM-5催化剂上，随着空间速度的增加，丙烷转化率降低，这是预期的结果。然而，ZSM-5-H和ZSM-5-Zn催化剂上的产物分布行为不同。

3. 在ZSM-5-H反应中，随着空间速度的增加，芳香族产品的比例（BTX、苯环Cg+、萘）减少，而C,,2产品的比例增加。

4. 相反，在ZSM-5-Zn上，随着空间速度的增加，BTX的选择性略有增加，而苯环Cg+和萘的成分减少。

5. 随着空间速度的增加，C2组分中的乙烯比例上升，乙烷的比例下降，在两种催化剂上都观察到这一趋势。

6. 随着反应温度的升高，两种催化剂上的丙烷转化率提高。

7. 在低空间速度下，ZSM-5-H的甲烷和乙烯比例高于ZSM-5-Zn。

8. 随着空间速度的改变，两种催化剂上的C,,2产品组成也发生变化。
