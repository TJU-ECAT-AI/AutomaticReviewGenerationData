The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy.
Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms.
The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acid-base pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures.
In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga+ cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species.
Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons.
This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation.

The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts occurs through two distinct mechanisms. Ethane's stronger molecular adsorption onto acid-base pairs consisting of distant cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites leads to polarizability and heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. Conversely, ethane adsorption onto Ga+ cations is weak, leading to dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating with the cationic gallium species. Zinc-induced dissociation yields a Brnsted acid proton, whereas gallium-induced dissociation forms gallium dihydride species without generating Brnsted acid protons. These differences impact hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation.

乙烯在锌和镓修饰的HZSM-5脱氢催化剂上的活化通过两种不同的机制发生。乙烯与由远距离的二价Zn2+正离子和基本氧原子组成的酸碱对之间的更强分子吸附，在室温下导致吸附乙烯的极化性增强，并在适中的温度下进行异裂吸附。相反，乙烯吸附在Ga+离子上较弱，在高温下发生烃类的解离吸附，形成乙基和氢化物碎片与带正电的镓物种协调。锌诱导的分解产生Brnsted酸质子，而镓诱导的分解形成镓氢化物物种而不产生Brnsted酸质子。这些差异直接影响涉及脱氢的碳氢化合物转化。

The study investigates the activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts using diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy. It reveals two distinct mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation: one involves strong molecular adsorption of ethane by acid-base pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. The other mechanism involves weak molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga+ cations, resulting in dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The differences in alkane activation have significant implications for hydrocarbon conversions, particularly dehydrogenation processes.
