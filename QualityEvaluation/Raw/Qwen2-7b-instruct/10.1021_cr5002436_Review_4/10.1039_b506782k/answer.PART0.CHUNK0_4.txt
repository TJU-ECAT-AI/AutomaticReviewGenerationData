[1] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
[2] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acid-base pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."
[3] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga+ cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."
[4] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."

1. Activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts proceeds through two distinct mechanisms due to the nature of the cations' interaction with ethane.
2. The presence of bivalent Zn2+ and univalent Ga cations leads to a stronger adsorption of ethane, causing polarizability at room temperature and heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures.
3. Ethane adsorption on Ga+ cations is weak; at high temperatures, dissociative adsorption occurs, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species.
4. These differences in alkane activation have direct implications for hydrocarbon conversions, particularly in dehydrogenation processes.

1. 锌和镓修饰的HZSM-5脱氢催化剂上，碳氢化合物的激活通过两种截然不同的机制进行。
2. 双价锌离子（Zn2+）和单价镓离子（Ga+）的存在导致乙烷更强的吸附，在室温下引起吸附乙烷的极化性，并在中等温度下发生异裂吸附。
3. 在镓离子上，乙烷的吸附较弱；高温下发生解离吸附，形成与镓物种配位的乙基和氢化物碎片。
4. 这些烷烃激活的差异直接影响了涉及脱氢的烃类转化过程。
