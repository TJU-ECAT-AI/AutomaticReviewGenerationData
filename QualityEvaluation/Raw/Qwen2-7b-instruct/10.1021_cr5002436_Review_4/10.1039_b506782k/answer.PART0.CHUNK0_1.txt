The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy.
Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms.
The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures.
In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga+ cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species.
Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons.
This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation.

锌和镓修饰的HZSM-5催化剂上乙烷激活涉及不同的机制。由带电正离子Zn2+和基本氧原子形成的酸碱对吸附乙烷导致强极化性和在温和温度下的异裂吸附。相反，乙烷分子吸附在Ga+离子上较弱，在高温下发生分解性烃类吸附，形成与带电镓物种协调的乙基和氢化物碎片。在锌上，乙烷分解产生Brnsted酸质子，而在镓上，它形成镓二氢物种而不产生Brnsted酸质子。这些差异影响涉及脱氢的烃转化。
