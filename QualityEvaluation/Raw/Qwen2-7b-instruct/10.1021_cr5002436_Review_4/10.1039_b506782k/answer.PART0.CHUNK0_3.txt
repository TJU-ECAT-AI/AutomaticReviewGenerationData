On two alternative mechanisms of ethane activation over ZSM-5 zeolite modified by Zn2+ and Ga1+cations.
The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy.
Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms.
In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga+ cations is weak.
At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species.
Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons.
This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation.

Ethane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts occurs through two distinct mechanisms. The presence of distantly separated cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites leads to strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane at room temperature, followed by heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane onto Ga+ cations is weak, and dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. Ethane dissociation over zinc forms a Brnsted acid proton, whereas on gallium, it results in gallium dihydride species, not leading to Brnsted acid protons.

在锌和镓改性的HZSM-5催化剂上，乙烷激活通过两种不同的机制发生。含有远距离分离的二价Zn2+和基本氧基位点的存在导致室温下吸附的乙烷的强烈极化性，并在适中温度下进行异裂吸附。相比之下，在镓上的分子乙烷吸附较弱，在高温下发生脱附式烃吸附，形成与带正电镓物种协调的乙基和氢化物碎片。锌上的乙烷分解形成酸性Brnsted质子，而在镓上，则产生镓氢化物物种，不导致Brnsted酸性质子。
