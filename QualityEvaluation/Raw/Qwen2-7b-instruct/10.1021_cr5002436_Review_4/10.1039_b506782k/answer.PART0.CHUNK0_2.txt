The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy.
Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms.
The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acid-base pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures.
In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga+ cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species.
Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons.
This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation.

The study investigates the activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts using diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy. It reveals two distinct mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation: one involves strong molecular adsorption of ethane by acid-base pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn2+ and basic oxygen sites, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. The other mechanism involves weak molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga+ cations, resulting in dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species. The differences in alkane activation have significant implications for hydrocarbon conversions, particularly dehydrogenation processes.

研究使用差分反射红外光谱法探讨了锌-和镓修饰的HZSM-5脱氢催化剂上乙烷的活化。研究揭示了两种不同的活化机制：一种是通过酸碱对的强分子吸附，该酸碱对由远距离分布的二价Zn2+正离子和基本氧原子位点形成，导致室温下吸附的乙烷产生强极化性，并在适度温度下进行异裂吸附。另一种机制涉及弱分子吸附在Ga+离子上，导致高温下的解离烃吸附，形成与镓正离子物种配位的乙基和氢化物碎片。不同烷基激活的差异直接关系到涉及脱氢的烃类转化过程。
