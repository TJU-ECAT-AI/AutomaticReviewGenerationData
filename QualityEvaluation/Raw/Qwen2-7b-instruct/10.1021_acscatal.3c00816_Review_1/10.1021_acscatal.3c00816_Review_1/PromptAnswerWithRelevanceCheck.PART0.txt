[1] "In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[2] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[3] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."
[4] "In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3."
[5] "The same group (29,30) also investigated the effect of second promoters (M = Ce, La, In, Fe, Mg) on the PDH performance over trimetallic PtM/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts. Among the investigated catalysts, PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 shows the highest initial propane conversion, while PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 exhibits the best catalytic stability."
[6] "Gong et al. (43) reported a pioneering work which uses a subsurface engineering strategy to improve the PDH performance. The Pt and M species (M = Ni, Fe, Co) were impregnated on an SBA-15 support to form PtM/SBA-15. Then, selective etching of the superficial M atoms by HNO3 produces PtM@Pt/SBA-15 with a Pt-shell and PtM-core structure."
[7] "The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) is another advanced mesoporous silica support, which was typically synthesized using quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants (CTAB, CTAC, etc.)."
[8] "Wang et al. (84) reported novel silica nanomeshes (SiO2 NMs) that possesses abundant oxygen vacancies to anchor cobalt single atoms (Co SAs) sites for PDH. The SiO2 NMs possess ultrashort 3D channels (pore size of 3.7 nm) with a large surface area of 804 m2·g−1, and this ordered porous structure could be maintained after 900 C calcination."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key points. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS catalysts offer advantages such as lower acidity and higher specific surface area with an ordered pore structure. This contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity.

When examining the behavior of these catalysts, it is observed that lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction. H2 pretreatment can eliminate the CO product produced initially, indicating that the lattice oxygen species are involved in the reaction. Additionally, the structure of CrOx species changes upon calcination, transforming from CrO42 to isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3 when exposed to flowing air.

In terms of activity, the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst demonstrates better performance than the CrOx/MCM-41 counterpart, achieving a higher propane productivity and propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the introduction of second promoters such as Ce, La, In, Fe, and Mg in trimetallic PtM/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts affects their PDH performance, with PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 showing the highest initial propane conversion and PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 exhibiting the best catalytic stability.

A groundbreaking approach involves the use of subsurface engineering to enhance PDH performance. By selectively etching superficial metal atoms, a Pt-shell and PtM-core structure is created, which restrains CC cracking reactions on transition metal sites and enriches the electron density of superficial Pt sites. This results in improved propylene selectivity.

Another advanced mesoporous silica support is the dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN), synthesized using quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants. Its 3D interconnected structure, large pore entrance, and uniform morphology facilitate better access to active sites and diffusion efficiency of reactants, leading to enhanced PDH performance.

Lastly, silica nanomeshes (SiO2 NMs) with abundant oxygen vacancies anchor cobalt single atoms (Co SAs) sites, providing a unique structure with ultrashort 3D channels and a large surface area. This maintains the ordered porous structure after calcination at 900°C, contributing to superior PDH activity and propylene selectivity.

These insights highlight the advantages and limitations of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, as well as the innovative strategies employed to improve their performance in PDH reactions.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能揭示了一些关键点。与传统金属氧化物支持如非晶态SiO2和Al2O3相比，OMS催化剂具有低酸性和高特定表面积以及有序孔结构的优势。这有助于活性位点的分散和抗结焦能力。

在考察这些催化剂的行为时，发现晶格氧物种在PDH反应中起着关键作用。H2预处理可以消除初始产生的CO产品，表明晶格氧物种参与了反应。此外，CrOx物种在空气流动下的煅烧过程中，从CrO42形式转化为孤立的Cr6+物种，以CrO3的形式存在。

在活动性方面，VOx/MCM-41催化剂的性能优于CrOx/MCM-41对应物，实现了更高的丙烷产率和丙烯选择性。此外，在PtM/Sn-SBA-15催化剂中引入第二促进剂（Ce、La、In、Fe、Mg），对PDH性能产生影响，其中PtFe/Sn-SBA-15显示最高的初始丙烷转化率，而PtIn/Sn-SBA-15表现出最佳的催化稳定性。

一种突破性的方法是使用亚表面工程来提高PDH性能。通过选择性蚀刻表面金属原子，形成了一种Pt壳和PtM核心结构，这限制了过渡金属位点上的CC裂解反应，并增强了表面Pt位点的电子密度。这导致了丙烯选择性的改善。

另一种先进的微孔硅支持是带状微孔硅纳米粒子（DMSN），由四甲基铵阳离子表面活性剂合成。其三维互联结构、大孔入口和均匀的单分散形态促进了对活性位点的更好访问和反应物的扩散效率，从而提高了PDH性能。

最后，二氧化硅纳米网（SiO2 NMs）富含氧缺陷锚定钴单原子（Co SAs）位点，提供了一个独特的结构，具有超短三维通道和大的表面积。这在900°C煅烧后维持了有序的多孔结构，为PDH活性和丙烯选择性提供了优越性。

这些见解强调了MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂的优点和局限性，以及用于提高PDH反应性能的创新策略。

1. Metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their low acidity, high specific surface area, and ordered pore structure. These features facilitate the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been extensively studied in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, showing significant propylene productivity, albeit with rapid deactivation. Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction, as demonstrated by the elimination of CO product through hydrogen pretreatment. The oxidized forms of CrOx and VOx are more active than their reduced counterparts, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is identified as a key factor contributing to deactivation. The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits superior activity compared to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

2. Calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air enhances the dispersion of CrOx, leading to improved PDH performance compared to static air calcination. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that Cr species in impregnated catalysts exist as CrO42 before calcination. Upon calcination in flowing air, these species dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species, whereas in static air calcination, they remain stable at 350°C, forming aggregated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline Cr2O3.

3. Optimized catalysts with a high amount of tetrahedral Co2+ sites achieve a propane conversion of 37% and a propylene selectivity of 96%. Hydrogen pre-reduction affects the Co structure and PDH activity in a model catalyst based on Co@MCM-41. Controlling the hydrothermal reaction temperature during synthesis allows for regulation of the pore size of Sn-SBA-15 supports, leading to the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9% for a catalyst with a medium pore size of 7.6 nm. Incorporating Sn within the hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) framework strengthens SiOSn bonds, inhibiting the reduction and loss of Sn species, and leads to a 1.1 wt% loss after 166 hours of PDH reaction.

4. Simultaneous addition of Si and Cr sources during synthesis maximizes Cr dispersion on the dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) support, resulting in superior PDH performance. DFT calculations confirm that the Pt3Mn structure possesses a stronger CH bond activation ability than Pt4, consistent with the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst. The Co single atom (SA)/SiO2 nanomeshes (NM) catalyst demonstrates superior PDH activity (TOF of Co = 196 h1) and propylene selectivity (95%) compared to Co SA/SiO2 (TOF = 49 h1 and propylene selectivity = 83%).

2. 在流动空气下对浸渍Cr/MCM-41进行煅烧可以促进CrOx的分散，从而提高PDH性能，与静态空气煅烧相比。原位拉曼光谱显示，浸渍催化剂中的Cr物种在干燥前以CrO42的形式存在。在流动空气中煅烧后，这些物种脱水成孤立的Cr6+物种，而在静态空气煅烧时，它们在350°C保持稳定，并进一步增加煅烧温度会导致形成结晶Cr2O3形式的聚合Cr3+物种。

3. 最优化合剂中具有大量四面体Co2+位点的催化剂可实现37%的丙烷转化率和96%的丙烯选择性。基于Co@MCM-41的模型催化剂中，氢预处理影响Co结构和PDH活性。控制合成过程中Si和Cr源的添加允许调节Sn-SBA-15支撑的孔径大小，实现最佳催化性能，其中孔径为7.6 nm的催化剂可获得46.9%的丙烷转化率。将Sn引入六角形介孔硅（HMS）框架中增强了SiOSn键，抑制了Sn物种的还原和损失，导致166小时内PDH反应后的Sn含量减少1.1 wt%。

4. 同时添加Si和Cr源期间的合成最大限度地提高了Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle（DMSN）支持上的Cr分散，从而实现优越的PDH性能。第一性原理计算证实，Pt3Mn结构比Pt4具有更强的CH键激活能力，这与具有最高TOF（Turnover Frequency）的Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN催化剂一致。Co单原子（SA）/SiO2纳米网（NM）催化剂表现出卓越的PDH活性（Co的TOF = 196 h1）和丙烯选择性（95%），与Co SA/SiO2（TOF = 49 h1和丙烯选择性 = 83%）相比。

These features facilitate the dispersion of reactive sites and enhance anticoking capacity. The presence of lattice oxygen species in the catalysts plays a significant role in the PDH reaction, and pretreatment with hydrogen can eliminate unwanted CO products.

2. The oxidized CrOx and VOx species demonstrate higher activity than their reduced forms. The deactivation of these catalysts is attributed to the depletion of lattice oxygen species, which is crucial for maintaining their catalytic performance.

3. Calcining Cr/MCM-41 catalysts in flowing air rather than static air promotes better dispersion of CrOx species, leading to improved PDH performance. This is due to the dehydration of CrO42 species into isolated Cr6+ species in flowing air conditions, whereas in static air, the species remain stable at lower temperatures and aggregate at higher temperatures.

4. The diffusion of impregnated metallic precursors is limited in supports with smaller pore sizes, resulting in inferior PDH performance. Conversely, supports with larger pores experience dramatic metal aggregation during the reaction, also leading to poor performance.

5. Catalysts with a medium pore size, specifically around 7.6 nm, exhibit the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9%, demonstrating the importance of pore size in achieving optimal PDH activity.

6. "In addition to impregnating metal species on molecular sieves, the coassembly of the metal precursor and silica source enables the metal species to be incorporated within the framework of MCM-41 and SBA-15."
7. "For the supports with a smaller pore size (5.3 nm), the diffusion of impregnated metallic precursors was limited, while for the ones with larger pores (11.0 and 13.7 nm), the metal aggregation during the reaction becomes dramatic."
8. "The incorporation of Sn within the HMS framework strengthens the SiOSn bonds, which inhibits the reduction and loss of Sn species."
9. "The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) is another advanced mesoporous silica support, which was typically synthesized using quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants (CTAB, CTAC, etc.)."
10. "During the calcination and reduction processes, the MnOx species would react with Pt to form PtxMny alloys with different stoichiometric ratios on the basis of the Mn loadings."
11. "Moreover, the ultrashort 3D channels of SiO2 NMs support, along with the coordinative unsaturated and reduction-resistant Co SAs sites, lead to superior PDH activity and propylene selectivity."
