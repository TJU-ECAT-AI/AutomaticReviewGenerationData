[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process."
[2] "In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[4] "The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."
[5] "The calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air (Cr/MCM-41-FC) can promote the CrOx dispersion, which contributes to superior PDH performance compared to the counterpart calcinated in static air (Cr/MCM-41-TC)."
[6] "In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3. However, when the sample was calcinated in static air, the CrO42 species remained stable at 350 C, and further increasing the calcination temperature resulted in aggregated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline Cr2O3."
[7] "For the supports with a smaller pore size (5.3 nm), the diffusion of impregnated metallic precursors was limited, while for the ones with larger pores (11.0 and 13.7 nm), the metal aggregation during the reaction becomes dramatic. Both cases lead to an inferior PDH performance."
[8] "The best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9% was obtained on the catalyst with a medium pore size (7.6 nm)."

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, exhibit advantages in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their low acidity, high specific surface area, and ordered pore structure. These features facilitate the dispersion of reactive sites and enhance anticoking capacity. The presence of lattice oxygen species in the catalysts plays a significant role in the PDH reaction, and pretreatment with hydrogen can eliminate unwanted CO products.

2. The oxidized CrOx and VOx species demonstrate higher activity than their reduced forms. The deactivation of these catalysts is attributed to the depletion of lattice oxygen species, which is crucial for maintaining their catalytic performance.

3. Calcining Cr/MCM-41 catalysts in flowing air rather than static air promotes better dispersion of CrOx species, leading to improved PDH performance. This is due to the dehydration of CrO42 species into isolated Cr6+ species in flowing air conditions, whereas in static air, the species remain stable at lower temperatures and aggregate at higher temperatures.

4. The diffusion of impregnated metallic precursors is limited in supports with smaller pore sizes, resulting in inferior PDH performance. Conversely, supports with larger pores experience dramatic metal aggregation during the reaction, also leading to poor performance.

5. Catalysts with a medium pore size, specifically around 7.6 nm, exhibit the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9%, demonstrating the importance of pore size in achieving optimal PDH activity.

1. 在丙烷裂解（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，由于其低酸性、高特定表面面积和有序孔结构而表现出优势。这些特征有助于反应位点的分散并增强抗结焦能力。催化剂中的晶格氧物种在PDH反应中起着重要作用，并且氢处理可以消除不必要的CO产物。

2. 氧化的CrOx和VOx物种比它们的还原形式显示出更高的活性。这些催化剂的失活归因于晶格氧物种的耗尽，这是维持其催化性能的关键。

3. 在流动空气中而非静态空气中煅烧Cr/MCM-41催化剂可以促进CrOx物种的分散，从而提高PDH性能。这是由于在流动空气条件下，CrO42物种脱水成孤立的Cr6+物种，而在静态空气中，该物种在较低温度下保持稳定并在较高温度下聚合为结晶Cr2O3形式。

4. 小孔径支持物中的限域金属前体扩散导致了较差的PDH性能。相反，在反应过程中，大孔径支持物中的金属聚集导致性能变差。

5. 孔径约为7.6纳米的催化剂表现出最佳的催化性能，丙烷转化率为46.9%，这表明孔径大小对实现最佳PDH活性的重要性。
