[1] "In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[2] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation (Table 2)."
[3] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[4] "The results indicate that the oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is proposed as an important reason for the deactivation."
[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."
[6] "Calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air (Cr/MCM-41-FC) can promote the CrOx dispersion, which contributes to superior PDH performance compared to the counterpart calcinated in static air (Cr/MCM-41-TC)."
[7] "In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3. However, when the sample was calcinated in static air, the CrO42 species remained stable at 350 C, and further increasing the calcination temperature resulted in aggregated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline Cr2O3."
[8] "The optimized catalyst with the highest amount of Td Co2+ sites achieves a propane conversion of 37% and propylene selectivity of 96%."
[9] "This Co@MCM-41 was used as a model catalyst to investigate the effect of H2 prereduction on the Co structure and PDH activity."
[10] "For synthesizing PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts, the control of the hydrothermal reaction temperature enables regulation of the pore size of Sn-SBA-15 supports from 5 to 14 nm."
[11] "The best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9% was obtained on the catalyst with a medium pore size (7.6 nm)."
[12] "The incorporation of Sn within the HMS framework strengthens the SiOSn bonds, which inhibits the reduction and loss of Sn species."
[13] "Specifically, the Sn content in Sn-HMS decreases from 3.58 to 3.54 wt % after 166 h of PDH reaction, which is indicative of 1.1 wt % loss of Sn species."
[14] "Wang et al. (128) revealed that simultaneous addition of Si and Cr sources during synthesis leads to the highest Cr dispersion on the DMSN support, resulting in superior performance of PDH."
[15] "Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3Mn structure possesses a stronger CH bond activation ability than Pt4, which is consistent with the highest TOF of Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst (Figure 3b)."
[16] "This Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst exhibits superior PDH activity (TOFCo = 196 h1, Figure 3d) and propylene selectivity (95%) compared to Co SAs/SiO2 (TOF = 49 h1 and propylene selectivity is 83%)."

1. Metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their low acidity, high specific surface area, and ordered pore structure. These features facilitate the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been extensively studied in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, showing significant propylene productivity, albeit with rapid deactivation. Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction, as demonstrated by the elimination of CO product through hydrogen pretreatment. The oxidized forms of CrOx and VOx are more active than their reduced counterparts, and the depletion of lattice oxygen is identified as a key factor contributing to deactivation. The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits superior activity compared to CrOx/MCM-41, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

2. Calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air enhances the dispersion of CrOx, leading to improved PDH performance compared to static air calcination. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that Cr species in impregnated catalysts exist as CrO42 before calcination. Upon calcination in flowing air, these species dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species, whereas in static air calcination, they remain stable at 350°C, forming aggregated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline Cr2O3.

3. Optimized catalysts with a high amount of tetrahedral Co2+ sites achieve a propane conversion of 37% and a propylene selectivity of 96%. Hydrogen pre-reduction affects the Co structure and PDH activity in a model catalyst based on Co@MCM-41. Controlling the hydrothermal reaction temperature during synthesis allows for regulation of the pore size of Sn-SBA-15 supports, leading to the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9% for a catalyst with a medium pore size of 7.6 nm. Incorporating Sn within the hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) framework strengthens SiOSn bonds, inhibiting the reduction and loss of Sn species, and leads to a 1.1 wt% loss after 166 hours of PDH reaction.

4. Simultaneous addition of Si and Cr sources during synthesis maximizes Cr dispersion on the dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) support, resulting in superior PDH performance. DFT calculations confirm that the Pt3Mn structure possesses a stronger CH bond activation ability than Pt4, consistent with the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of the Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst. The Co single atom (SA)/SiO2 nanomeshes (NM) catalyst demonstrates superior PDH activity (TOF of Co = 196 h1) and propylene selectivity (95%) compared to Co SA/SiO2 (TOF = 49 h1 and propylene selectivity = 83%).

1. 金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中显示出与传统金属氧化物支持相比的优势。这些优势包括低酸性、高特定表面积和有序孔结构，有助于活性位点的分散和抗结焦能力。在MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx已经在PDH反应中进行了广泛研究，显示出显著的丙烯产率，但快速失活。层状氧物种在PDH反应中起着关键作用，通过氢预处理可以消除初始3小时反应中的CO产物。氧化态的CrOx和VOx比其还原态更活跃，层状氧的耗竭被认为是失活的主要原因。VOx/MCM-41催化剂的活性优于CrOx/MCM-41，实现了0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1的丙烷产率和90%的丙烯选择性。

2. 在流动空气下对浸渍Cr/MCM-41进行煅烧可以促进CrOx的分散，从而提高PDH性能，与静态空气煅烧相比。原位拉曼光谱显示，浸渍催化剂中的Cr物种在干燥前以CrO42的形式存在。在流动空气中煅烧后，这些物种脱水成孤立的Cr6+物种，而在静态空气煅烧时，它们在350°C保持稳定，并进一步增加煅烧温度会导致形成结晶Cr2O3形式的聚合Cr3+物种。

3. 最优化合剂中具有大量四面体Co2+位点的催化剂可实现37%的丙烷转化率和96%的丙烯选择性。基于Co@MCM-41的模型催化剂中，氢预处理影响Co结构和PDH活性。控制合成过程中Si和Cr源的添加允许调节Sn-SBA-15支撑的孔径大小，实现最佳催化性能，其中孔径为7.6 nm的催化剂可获得46.9%的丙烷转化率。将Sn引入六角形介孔硅（HMS）框架中增强了SiOSn键，抑制了Sn物种的还原和损失，导致166小时内PDH反应后的Sn含量减少1.1 wt%。

4. 同时添加Si和Cr源期间的合成最大限度地提高了Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle（DMSN）支持上的Cr分散，从而实现优越的PDH性能。第一性原理计算证实，Pt3Mn结构比Pt4具有更强的CH键激活能力，这与具有最高TOF（Turnover Frequency）的Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN催化剂一致。Co单原子（SA）/SiO2纳米网（NM）催化剂表现出卓越的PDH活性（Co的TOF = 196 h1）和丙烯选择性（95%），与Co SA/SiO2（TOF = 49 h1和丙烯选择性 = 83%）相比。
