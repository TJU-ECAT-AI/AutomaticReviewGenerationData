[1] "In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[2] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[3] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."
[4] "In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3."
[5] "The same group (29,30) also investigated the effect of second promoters (M = Ce, La, In, Fe, Mg) on the PDH performance over trimetallic PtM/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts. Among the investigated catalysts, PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 shows the highest initial propane conversion, while PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 exhibits the best catalytic stability."
[6] "Gong et al. (43) reported a pioneering work which uses a subsurface engineering strategy to improve the PDH performance. The Pt and M species (M = Ni, Fe, Co) were impregnated on an SBA-15 support to form PtM/SBA-15. Then, selective etching of the superficial M atoms by HNO3 produces PtM@Pt/SBA-15 with a Pt-shell and PtM-core structure."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key points. Compared to traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3, OMS catalysts offer advantages such as lower acidity and higher specific surface area with an ordered pore structure. This contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity.

When examining the behavior of these catalysts, it is observed that lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction. H2 pretreatment can eliminate the CO product produced initially, indicating that the lattice oxygen species are involved in the reaction. Additionally, the structure of CrOx species changes upon calcination, transforming from CrO42 to isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3 when exposed to flowing air.

In terms of activity, the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst demonstrates better performance than the CrOx/MCM-41 counterpart, achieving a higher propane productivity and propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the introduction of second promoters such as Ce, La, In, Fe, and Mg in trimetallic PtM/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts affects their PDH performance, with PtFe/Sn-SBA-15 showing the highest initial propane conversion and PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 exhibiting the best catalytic stability.

A groundbreaking approach involves the use of subsurface engineering to enhance PDH performance. By selectively etching superficial metal atoms, a Pt-shell and PtM-core structure is created, which restrains CC cracking reactions on transition metal sites and enriches the electron density of superficial Pt sites. This results in improved propylene selectivity.

Another advanced mesoporous silica support is the dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN), synthesized using quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants. Its 3D interconnected structure, large pore entrance, and uniform morphology facilitate better access to active sites and diffusion efficiency of reactants, leading to enhanced PDH performance.

Lastly, silica nanomeshes (SiO2 NMs) with abundant oxygen vacancies anchor cobalt single atoms (Co SAs) sites, providing a unique structure with ultrashort 3D channels and a large surface area. This maintains the ordered porous structure after calcination at 900°C, contributing to superior PDH activity and propylene selectivity.

These insights highlight the advantages and limitations of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, as well as the innovative strategies employed to improve their performance in PDH reactions.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能揭示了一些关键点。与传统金属氧化物支持如非晶态SiO2和Al2O3相比，OMS催化剂具有低酸性和高特定表面积以及有序孔结构的优势。这有助于活性位点的分散和抗结焦能力。

在考察这些催化剂的行为时，发现晶格氧物种在PDH反应中起着关键作用。H2预处理可以消除初始产生的CO产品，表明晶格氧物种参与了反应。此外，CrOx物种在空气流动下的煅烧过程中，从CrO42形式转化为孤立的Cr6+物种，以CrO3的形式存在。

在活动性方面，VOx/MCM-41催化剂的性能优于CrOx/MCM-41对应物，实现了更高的丙烷产率和丙烯选择性。此外，在PtM/Sn-SBA-15催化剂中引入第二促进剂（Ce、La、In、Fe、Mg），对PDH性能产生影响，其中PtFe/Sn-SBA-15显示最高的初始丙烷转化率，而PtIn/Sn-SBA-15表现出最佳的催化稳定性。

一种突破性的方法是使用亚表面工程来提高PDH性能。通过选择性蚀刻表面金属原子，形成了一种Pt壳和PtM核心结构，这限制了过渡金属位点上的CC裂解反应，并增强了表面Pt位点的电子密度。这导致了丙烯选择性的改善。

另一种先进的微孔硅支持是带状微孔硅纳米粒子（DMSN），由四甲基铵阳离子表面活性剂合成。其三维互联结构、大孔入口和均匀的单分散形态促进了对活性位点的更好访问和反应物的扩散效率，从而提高了PDH性能。

最后，二氧化硅纳米网（SiO2 NMs）富含氧缺陷锚定钴单原子（Co SAs）位点，提供了一个独特的结构，具有超短三维通道和大的表面积。这在900°C煅烧后维持了有序的多孔结构，为PDH活性和丙烯选择性提供了优越性。

这些见解强调了MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂的优点和局限性，以及用于提高PDH反应性能的创新策略。
