[1] "OMS is a commonly used support in PDH, which is generally synthesized via a self-assembly process."
[2] "In comparison to the metal oxide supports (amorphous SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), tOMS has advantages of low acidity and high specific surface area with an ordered pore structure, which contributes to the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity."
[3] "The VOx or CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 has been widely investigated in PDH reactions, which show considerable propylene productivity, but suffer from fast deactivation."
[4] "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
[5] "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."
[6] "Calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air (Cr/MCM-41-FC) can promote the CrOx dispersion, which contributes to superior PDH performance compared to the counterpart calcinated in static air (Cr/MCM-41-TC)."
[7] "In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3."
[8] "In addition to impregnating metal species on molecular sieves, the coassembly of the metal precursor and silica source enables the metal species to be incorporated within the framework of MCM-41 and SBA-15."
[9] "This Co@MCM-41 was used as a model catalyst to investigate the effect of H2 prereduction on the Co structure and PDH activity."
[10] "The best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 46.9% was obtained on the catalyst with a medium pore size (7.6 nm)."
[11] "The incorporation of Sn within the HMS framework strengthens the SiOSn bonds, which inhibits the reduction and loss of Sn species."
[12] "Researchers have indicated that the 3D interconnected central-radial porous structure, larger pore entrance, and uniform monodispersed morphology of DMSN can facilitate the accessibility of active sites and the diffusion efficiency of reactants compared to MCM-41, SBA-15, and HMS materials."
[13] "The ultrashort 3D channels of SiO2 NMs support, along with the coordinative unsaturated and reduction-resistant Co SAs sites, contribute to the superior PDH activity and propylene selectivity of the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst."

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly those supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15, exhibit advantages in PDH reactions due to their low acidity, high specific surface area, and ordered pore structure. These features facilitate the dispersion of reactive sites and anticoking capacity.

2. Traditional metal oxide supports like amorphous SiO2 and Al2O3 have been replaced by MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to their superior performance in PDH reactions. VOx and CrOx supported on these materials show considerable propylene productivity, though they suffer from fast deactivation.

3. H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in eliminating the CO product generated during the initial stages of PDH reactions over as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, indicating the involvement of lattice oxygen species in the reaction mechanism.

4. The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst demonstrates better catalytic activity than its CrOx counterpart, achieving a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

5. Calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air enhances the dispersion of CrOx, resulting in superior PDH performance compared to the counterpart calcinated in static air.

6. The calcination process of impregnated catalysts leads to the dehydration of CrO42 species into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3, affecting the catalyst's performance.
