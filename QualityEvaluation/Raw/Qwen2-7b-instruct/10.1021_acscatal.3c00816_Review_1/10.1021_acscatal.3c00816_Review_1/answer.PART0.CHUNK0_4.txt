2. "For as-prepared MCM-41 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, a small amount of CO product was detected in the initial 3 h reaction over as-prepared catalysts, while a H2 pretreatment eliminates such CO product, implying the lattice oxygen species of as-prepared CrOx and VOx participate in the PDH reaction."
3. "The VOx/MCM-41 exhibits better catalytic activity than CrOx/MCM-41, which achieves a propane productivity of 0.2 kgC3H6 ·kgcat1·h1 and a propylene selectivity of 90%."
4. "Calcination of impregnated Cr/MCM-41 in flowing air (Cr/MCM-41-FC) can promote the CrOx dispersion, which contributes to superior PDH performance compared to the counterpart calcinated in static air (Cr/MCM-41-TC)."
5. "In-situ Raman spectra revealed that Cr species in impregnated catalysts (after drying) exist in the form of CrO42. When the sample was calcinated in flowing air, the CrO42 species would dehydrate into isolated Cr6+ species in the form of CrO3."
6. "In addition to impregnating metal species on molecular sieves, the coassembly of the metal precursor and silica source enables the metal species to be incorporated within the framework of MCM-41 and SBA-15."
7. "For the supports with a smaller pore size (5.3 nm), the diffusion of impregnated metallic precursors was limited, while for the ones with larger pores (11.0 and 13.7 nm), the metal aggregation during the reaction becomes dramatic."
8. "The incorporation of Sn within the HMS framework strengthens the SiOSn bonds, which inhibits the reduction and loss of Sn species."
9. "The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (DMSN) is another advanced mesoporous silica support, which was typically synthesized using quaternary ammonium cationic surfactants (CTAB, CTAC, etc.)."
10. "During the calcination and reduction processes, the MnOx species would react with Pt to form PtxMny alloys with different stoichiometric ratios on the basis of the Mn loadings."
11. "Moreover, the ultrashort 3D channels of SiO2 NMs support, along with the coordinative unsaturated and reduction-resistant Co SAs sites, lead to superior PDH activity and propylene selectivity."
