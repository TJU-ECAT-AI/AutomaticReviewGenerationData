Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

Answer: The literature does not provide specific data on the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It lacks detailed comparisons with traditional metal oxide supports, discussions on structural properties, catalytic behavior, advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. The text also does not cover how factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
