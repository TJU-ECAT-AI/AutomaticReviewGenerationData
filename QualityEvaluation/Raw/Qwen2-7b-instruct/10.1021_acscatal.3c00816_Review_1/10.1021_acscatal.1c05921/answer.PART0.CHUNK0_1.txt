The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was studied in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Their structural properties and catalytic behavior were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The analysis highlighted the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts. Factors affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, including lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, were also considered.
