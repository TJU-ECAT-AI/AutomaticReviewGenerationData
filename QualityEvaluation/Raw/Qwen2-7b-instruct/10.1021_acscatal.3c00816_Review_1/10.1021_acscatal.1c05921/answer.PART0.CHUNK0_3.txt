The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study compared their structural properties and catalytic behavior against traditional metal oxide supports, highlighting the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms involved. Additionally, the effects of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment were discussed as influencing factors on catalyst performance and deactivation during PDH reactions.
