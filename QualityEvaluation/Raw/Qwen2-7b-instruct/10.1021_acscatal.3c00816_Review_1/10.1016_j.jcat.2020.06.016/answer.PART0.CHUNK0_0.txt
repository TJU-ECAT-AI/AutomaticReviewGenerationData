Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports. These materials demonstrate superior performance due to their unique structural properties, notably pore size and surface area, which significantly affect their catalytic behavior. The lattice oxygen species within the OMS framework play a critical role in enhancing activity and selectivity. Pretreatment with hydrogen (H2) improves stability and performance, allowing for longer operational lifetimes. Compared to conventional metal oxides, OMS catalysts exhibit increased resistance to deactivation, contributing to their improved efficiency. However, the high cost and complex synthesis process limit their widespread industrial application.

在丙烷裂解（PDH）反应中，分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，表现出与传统金属氧化物支持相比的几个优势。这些材料由于其独特的结构特性，如孔径和比表面积，显示出了优越的性能。OMS框架内的晶格氧物种对催化剂的活性和选择性有重要影响。氢（H2）预处理可以提高稳定性并增强性能，从而延长运行时间。与常规金属氧化物相比，OMS催化剂显示出对失活的更高抵抗性，这有助于提高其效率。然而，高成本和复杂的合成过程限制了它们在工业中的广泛应用。
