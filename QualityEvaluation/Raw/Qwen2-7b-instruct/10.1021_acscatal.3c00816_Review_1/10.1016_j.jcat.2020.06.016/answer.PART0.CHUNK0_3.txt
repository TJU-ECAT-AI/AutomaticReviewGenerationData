The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been thoroughly examined. These catalysts possess advantages over traditional metal oxide supports, mainly due to their increased surface area and organized mesoporous structure. Compared to conventional metal oxides, OMS catalysts exhibit higher stability and selectivity in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species are pivotal in the catalytic activity of OMS-based catalysts, aiding in the dehydrogenation process. H2 pretreatment can notably increase the initial activity of these catalysts by encouraging the formation of active sites. However, challenges such as sintering and poisoning still limit the long-term performance of OMS catalysts.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能已被广泛研究。这些催化剂在传统金属氧化物支持中具有优势，主要由于其增强的表面积和有序的介孔结构。与常规金属氧化物相比，OMS催化剂在PDH反应中表现出更高的稳定性和选择性。晶格氧物种在OMS基催化剂的催化活性中起着关键作用，有助于脱氢过程。H2预处理可以显著提高这些催化剂的初始活性，通过促进活性位点的形成。然而，诸如烧结和中毒等失活机制仍然限制了OMS催化剂的长期性能。
