Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrated superior performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Their ordered mesoporous structure provided enhanced activity and selectivity. Structural characterization revealed specific surface area, pore size distribution, and crystallinity. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment influenced catalyst performance and deactivation, contributing to improved stability and activity. Advantages included better thermal stability, higher resistance to sintering, and ease of regeneration. However, limitations were observed in potential metal leaching under high-temperature conditions and the complexity of synthesis. Reaction mechanisms involved proton transfer, metal ion coordination, and activation of propane molecules.
