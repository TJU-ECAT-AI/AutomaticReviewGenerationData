[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "Inspiringly, Sn-based catalyst has been proved to be efficient for propane dehydrogenation in our recent work."
[5] "The dehydrogenation performance of Sn-based catalyst is even comparable to that of the industrially relevant Cr and Pt-based catalysts."
[6] "That is, Sn alone can act as the active component for dehydrogenation, instead of only a promoter for Pt-based catalyst."
[7] "However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species."
[8] "To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably."
[9] "Herein, the facilely synthesized hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) has been selected, given its appropriate physical and chemical properties."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalysts exhibit significantly higher propane conversion rates (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 hours compared to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts. This stability improvement is attributed to the strong interaction between Sn species and the HMS substrate, preventing Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species and stabilizing the Sn species through the mesoporous structure. The document also highlights that Sn-based catalysts are efficient for propane dehydrogenation, showing performance comparable to industrially relevant Cr and Pt-based catalysts. However, the catalyst's stability is found to degrade over time, specifically after 70 hours of operation, due to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point Sn species. To address this issue, the selection of a support with high surface area, such as hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), is suggested to anchor and incorporate Sn species more stably.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序微孔硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，表现出显著更高的丙烷转化率（40%）和长达170小时的更好脱氢稳定性，与传统的Sn/SiO2催化剂相比。这种稳定性改善归因于Sn物种与HMS基质之间的强相互作用，阻止了Sn向熔点较低的金属Sn物种的还原，并通过HMS基质的微孔结构稳定了Sn物种。文档还指出，基于Sn的催化剂对于丙烷脱氢是有效的，其性能与工业上相关的Cr和Pt基催化剂相当。然而，在运行70小时后，催化剂的稳定性发现会退化，主要归因于低熔点Sn物种的迁移和部分移除。为了解决这一问题，选择具有高表面积的支持，如六方微孔硅（HMS），被建议用于锚定和更稳定地整合Sn物种。
