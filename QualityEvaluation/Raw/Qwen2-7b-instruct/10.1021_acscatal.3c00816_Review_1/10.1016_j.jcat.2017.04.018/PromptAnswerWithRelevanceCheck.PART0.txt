<p>Since 1960s, an abundance of research has been focused on the promoting effects of Sn in Pt-based catalyst.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation performance of Sn-based catalyst is even comparable to that of the industrially relevant Cr and Pt-based catalysts. That is, Sn alone can act as the active component for dehydrogenation, instead of only a promoter for Pt-based catalyst.</p>
<p>However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species.</p>
<p>To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably. Herein, the facilely synthesized hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) has been selected, given its appropriate physical and chemical properties.</p>
<p>The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions.</p>

The document discusses the use of Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane. The Sn-HMS catalyst shows a higher propane conversion rate (40%) and better stability (up to 170 hours) compared to other catalysts. The enhanced stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the Sn species and the HMS structure, which inhibits the reduction of Sn to low-melting-point metallic Sn species. The document also proposes a reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the Sn-HMS catalyst. This study suggests that Sn can act as an active component for dehydrogenation rather than just a promoter for Pt-based catalysts. However, the catalyst's stability decreases over time due to the migration and partial removal of Sn species. To address this issue, the document suggests using a support material like HMS, which provides good thermal stability and fast product diffusion, to anchor and incorporate the Sn species more stably.

本文讨论了将Sn-含六方介孔硅（Sn-HMS）用作丙烷脱氢催化剂的应用。Sn-HMS催化剂显示出更高的丙烷转化率（40％）和更好的稳定性（高达170小时），与其它催化剂相比。增强的稳定性归因于Sn物种与HMS结构之间的强烈相互作用，这抑制了Sn向低熔点金属Sn物种的还原。本文还提出了在Sn-HMS催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的反应途径。这项研究表明，Sn可以作为脱氢的活性成分，而不仅仅是Pt基催化剂的促进剂。然而，催化剂的稳定性随着时间的推移而下降，原因是Sn物种的迁移和部分去除。为了解决这个问题，本文建议使用支持材料如HMS，它提供良好的热稳定性和快速的产品扩散性，以更稳定地锚定和整合Sn物种。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 catalysts exhibit high propane conversion rates and good stability up to 170 hours, even after three oxidative regenerations. This stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the metal species and the OMS substrate, which inhibits the reduction of metal species to low-melting-point metals. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 have thick walls and short channel lengths that ensure good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products. Their weak acidity facilitates the prompt desorption of olefins, reducing unwanted secondary reactions. However, these catalysts suffer from irreversible deactivation after a 70-hour run, primarily due to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point metal species. To improve catalyst stability, a support with a high surface area is chosen to anchor and incorporate the metal species more stably.

金属有序微孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能与传统金属氧化物支持进行了比较。MCM-41和SBA-15催化剂表现出高的丙烷转化率和长达170小时的良好稳定性，甚至在经过三次氧化再生后也是如此。这种稳定性归因于金属物种与OMS基质之间的强相互作用，这抑制了金属物种向低熔点金属的还原。MCM-41和SBA-15具有厚壁和短通道长度，确保了高达1073 K的良好的热稳定性和产品的快速扩散。它们的弱酸性促进了烯烃的快速释放，从而减少了不希望发生的副反应。然而，这些催化剂在运行70小时后会不可逆地失效，主要原因是低熔点金属物种的迁移和部分移除。为了提高催化剂稳定性，选择具有高表面积的支持物来更稳定地锚定和整合金属物种。

The study focuses on the synthesis and evaluation of Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane. The Sn-HMS catalyst demonstrates a significantly higher propane conversion rate of 40% compared to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts. This enhanced performance is attributed to the strong interaction between the Sn species and the HMS substrate, which inhibits the reduction of Sn to low-melting-point metallic Sn species and stabilizes the Sn species within the mesoporous structure of the HMS. The reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over the Sn-HMS catalyst has also been proposed.

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key insights. The use of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) as a support material for Sn-based catalysts shows significantly improved stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15. This enhanced stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the Sn species and the HMS substrate, which inhibits the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point Sn species, thus preventing irreversible deactivation during PDH reactions.

Structural properties of HMS play a crucial role in catalytic behavior. The thick walls and short channel length of HMS contribute to good thermal stability and fast diffusion of products, while its weak acidity aids in the prompt desorption of olefins, minimizing secondary reactions. In contrast, traditional metal oxides may suffer from less stable support materials and potentially higher deactivation rates under similar operating conditions. The lattice oxygen species and hydrogen pretreatment are critical factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Proper hydrogen pretreatment can stabilize the catalyst, enhancing its activity and longevity.

In summary, the use of HMS as a support for Sn-based catalysts offers significant advantages in terms of stability and efficiency in propane dehydrogenation reactions, making it a promising alternative to traditional metal oxide supports.

分析金属有序微孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能揭示了一些关键见解。使用六方微孔硅（HMS）作为Sn基催化剂的支持材料显示了与传统金属氧化物支持材料（如MCM-41和SBA-15）相比显著改善的稳定性。这种增强的稳定性归因于Sn物种与HMS基质之间的强烈相互作用，这抑制了低熔点Sn物种的迁移和部分去除，从而防止PDH反应期间的不可逆失活。

HMS的结构特性对催化行为起着关键作用。HMS的厚壁和短通道长度有助于良好的热稳定性和产品的快速扩散，而其弱酸性有助于烯烃的快速脱附，从而减少非期望的二次反应。相比之下，传统金属氧化物可能受到不太稳定的支撑材料的影响，并在相似的操作条件下具有更高的失活率。晶格氧物种和氢前处理是影响PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的关键因素。适当的氢前处理可以稳定催化剂，提高其活性和寿命。

综上所述，使用HMS作为Sn基催化剂的支持材料在丙烷脱氢反应中提供了显著的优势，特别是在稳定性方面，使其成为传统金属氧化物支持材料的有前景的替代品。
