[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively."
[5] "Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."
[6] "However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species."
[7] "To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 catalysts exhibit high propane conversion rates and good stability up to 170 hours, even after three oxidative regenerations. This stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the metal species and the OMS substrate, which inhibits the reduction of metal species to low-melting-point metals. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 have thick walls and short channel lengths that ensure good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products. Their weak acidity facilitates the prompt desorption of olefins, reducing unwanted secondary reactions. However, these catalysts suffer from irreversible deactivation after a 70-hour run, primarily due to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point metal species. To improve catalyst stability, a support with a high surface area is chosen to anchor and incorporate the metal species more stably.

金属有序微孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能与传统金属氧化物支持进行了比较。MCM-41和SBA-15催化剂表现出高的丙烷转化率和长达170小时的良好稳定性，甚至在经过三次氧化再生后也是如此。这种稳定性归因于金属物种与OMS基质之间的强相互作用，这抑制了金属物种向低熔点金属的还原。MCM-41和SBA-15具有厚壁和短通道长度，确保了高达1073 K的良好的热稳定性和产品的快速扩散。它们的弱酸性促进了烯烃的快速释放，从而减少了不希望发生的副反应。然而，这些催化剂在运行70小时后会不可逆地失效，主要原因是低熔点金属物种的迁移和部分移除。为了提高催化剂稳定性，选择具有高表面积的支持物来更稳定地锚定和整合金属物种。
