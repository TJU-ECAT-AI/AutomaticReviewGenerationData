[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "The reaction route of propane dehydrogenation over Sn-HMS catalyst has been proposed."

The study focuses on the synthesis and evaluation of Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane. The Sn-HMS catalyst demonstrates a significantly higher propane conversion rate of 40% compared to conventional Sn/SiO2 catalysts. This enhanced performance is attributed to the strong interaction between the Sn species and the HMS substrate, which inhibits the reduction of Sn to low-melting-point metallic Sn species and stabilizes the Sn species within the mesoporous structure of the HMS. The reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over the Sn-HMS catalyst has also been proposed.

研究集中在合成并评估Sn-六方介孔二氧化硅（Sn-HMS）作为丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂。Sn-HMS催化剂表现出令人鼓舞的更高丙烷转化率，达到40%，与传统的Sn/SiO2催化剂相比。这种增强的性能归因于Sn物种与HMS基质之间的强相互作用，这抑制了Sn向低熔点金属Sn物种的还原，并且由HMS基质的介孔结构稳定了Sn物种。在Sn-HMS催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢反应的反应途径也已被提出。
