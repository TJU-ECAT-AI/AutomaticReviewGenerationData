[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "Since 1960s, an abundance of research has been focused on the promoting effects of Sn in Pt-based catalyst."
[5] "Inspiringly, Sn-based catalyst has been proved to be efficient for propane dehydrogenation in our recent work."
[6] "However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species."
[7] "To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably."
[8] "Herein, the facilely synthesized hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) has been selected, given its appropriate physical and chemical properties."
[9] "The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively."
[10] "Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key insights. The use of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) as a support material for Sn-based catalysts shows significantly improved stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports like MCM-41 and SBA-15. This enhanced stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the Sn species and the HMS substrate, which inhibits the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point Sn species, thus preventing irreversible deactivation during PDH reactions.

Structural properties of HMS play a crucial role in catalytic behavior. The thick walls and short channel length of HMS contribute to good thermal stability and fast diffusion of products, while its weak acidity aids in the prompt desorption of olefins, minimizing secondary reactions. In contrast, traditional metal oxides may suffer from less stable support materials and potentially higher deactivation rates under similar operating conditions. The lattice oxygen species and hydrogen pretreatment are critical factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Proper hydrogen pretreatment can stabilize the catalyst, enhancing its activity and longevity.

In summary, the use of HMS as a support for Sn-based catalysts offers significant advantages in terms of stability and efficiency in propane dehydrogenation reactions, making it a promising alternative to traditional metal oxide supports.

分析金属有序微孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能揭示了一些关键见解。使用六方微孔硅（HMS）作为Sn基催化剂的支持材料显示了与传统金属氧化物支持材料（如MCM-41和SBA-15）相比显著改善的稳定性。这种增强的稳定性归因于Sn物种与HMS基质之间的强烈相互作用，这抑制了低熔点Sn物种的迁移和部分去除，从而防止PDH反应期间的不可逆失活。

HMS的结构特性对催化行为起着关键作用。HMS的厚壁和短通道长度有助于良好的热稳定性和产品的快速扩散，而其弱酸性有助于烯烃的快速脱附，从而减少非期望的二次反应。相比之下，传统金属氧化物可能受到不太稳定的支撑材料的影响，并在相似的操作条件下具有更高的失活率。晶格氧物种和氢前处理是影响PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的关键因素。适当的氢前处理可以稳定催化剂，提高其活性和寿命。

综上所述，使用HMS作为Sn基催化剂的支持材料在丙烷脱氢反应中提供了显著的优势，特别是在稳定性方面，使其成为传统金属氧化物支持材料的有前景的替代品。
