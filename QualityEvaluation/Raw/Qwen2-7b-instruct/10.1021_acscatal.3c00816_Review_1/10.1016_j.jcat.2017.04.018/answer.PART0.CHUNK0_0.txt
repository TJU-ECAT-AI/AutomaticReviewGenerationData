<p>Since 1960s, an abundance of research has been focused on the promoting effects of Sn in Pt-based catalyst.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation performance of Sn-based catalyst is even comparable to that of the industrially relevant Cr and Pt-based catalysts. That is, Sn alone can act as the active component for dehydrogenation, instead of only a promoter for Pt-based catalyst.</p>
<p>However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species.</p>
<p>To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably. Herein, the facilely synthesized hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) has been selected, given its appropriate physical and chemical properties.</p>
<p>The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions.</p>

The document discusses the use of Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane. The Sn-HMS catalyst shows a higher propane conversion rate (40%) and better stability (up to 170 hours) compared to other catalysts. The enhanced stability is attributed to the strong interaction between the Sn species and the HMS structure, which inhibits the reduction of Sn to low-melting-point metallic Sn species. The document also proposes a reaction pathway for propane dehydrogenation over the Sn-HMS catalyst. This study suggests that Sn can act as an active component for dehydrogenation rather than just a promoter for Pt-based catalysts. However, the catalyst's stability decreases over time due to the migration and partial removal of Sn species. To address this issue, the document suggests using a support material like HMS, which provides good thermal stability and fast product diffusion, to anchor and incorporate the Sn species more stably.

本文讨论了将Sn-含六方介孔硅（Sn-HMS）用作丙烷脱氢催化剂的应用。Sn-HMS催化剂显示出更高的丙烷转化率（40％）和更好的稳定性（高达170小时），与其它催化剂相比。增强的稳定性归因于Sn物种与HMS结构之间的强烈相互作用，这抑制了Sn向低熔点金属Sn物种的还原。本文还提出了在Sn-HMS催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的反应途径。这项研究表明，Sn可以作为脱氢的活性成分，而不仅仅是Pt基催化剂的促进剂。然而，催化剂的稳定性随着时间的推移而下降，原因是Sn物种的迁移和部分去除。为了解决这个问题，本文建议使用支持材料如HMS，它提供良好的热稳定性和快速的产品扩散性，以更稳定地锚定和整合Sn物种。
