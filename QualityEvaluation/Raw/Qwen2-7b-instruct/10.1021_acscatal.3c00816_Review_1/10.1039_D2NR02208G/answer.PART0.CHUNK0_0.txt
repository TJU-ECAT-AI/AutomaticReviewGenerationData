Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, highlights the importance of structural properties and catalytic behavior. MCM-41 and SBA-15, known for their mesoporous structures, offer significant advantages over traditional metal oxide supports. The lattice oxygen species within these materials play a crucial role in the activation of alkane molecules, promoting the cleavage of the CH bond for PDH reactions. The introduction of heteroatoms like sodium, cerium, and titanium modifies the electronic structure, enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity.

The presence of oxygen vacancies within the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports contributes to the stabilization of active metal species, thereby extending the catalyst lifetime. These oxygen vacancies act as additional sites for metal coordination, facilitating the formation of more stable active centers. Sodium doping, for instance, regulates the interaction between Brnsted sites and chromium components, decreasing the adsorption of propane and inhibiting the activation of CH bonds, thus improving selectivity.

However, the formation of a stable spinel crystal phase in Al2O3-supported CrOx catalysts leads to the loss of active Cr3+ constituents, as these ions shift to the lattice structure during high-temperature reactions, causing irreversible deactivation. It is acknowledged that Cr3+Ox is an active species in CrOx-based catalysts for PDH reactions. The increased amounts of oxygen vacancies can bring about strong interactions between cerium and chromium, further stabilizing the active species.

Moreover, the use of TiO2 as a promoter elevates the catalytic activity of Zn2+Ox species. The promoter facilitates the desorption of coordination unsaturated active Zn sites and promotes the migration of lattice oxygen, enhancing propene selectivity and catalyst stability. These findings underscore the potential of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions, highlighting the importance of structural and electronic modifications for optimized performance.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，突出了结构特性和催化行为的重要性。MCM-41和SBA-15因其多孔结构而提供了一系列显著优势，与传统金属氧化物支撑相比。这些材料内的晶格氧物种在激活烷烃分子中发挥着关键作用，促进CH键的断裂以进行PDH反应。

引入诸如钠、铈和钛之类的杂原子修改了电子结构，提高了催化活性和选择性。MCM-41和SBA-15支撑体中存在氧空位，有助于稳定活性金属物种，从而延长催化剂寿命。这些氧空位作为额外的金属配位点，促进形成更稳定的活性中心。

然而，在Al2O3支持的CrOx催化剂中形成的稳定尖晶石晶体相导致活性Cr3+成分的损失，因为这些离子在高温反应期间转移到晶格结构中，造成不可逆失活。承认Cr3+Ox是PDH反应中CrOx基催化剂的活性物种。增加的氧空位可以带来铈和铬之间强烈的相互作用，进一步稳定活性物种。

此外，使用TiO2作为促进剂可以提高Zn2+Ox物种的催化活性。促进剂促进了协调非饱和活性Zn位点的脱附，并促进了晶格氧的迁移，增强了丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。这些发现强调了MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的潜力，突出了结构和电学修改对于优化性能的重要性。
