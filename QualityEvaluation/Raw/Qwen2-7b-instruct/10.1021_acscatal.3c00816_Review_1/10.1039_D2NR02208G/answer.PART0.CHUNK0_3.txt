[1] "The authors found that the exposed active Zn species on the surface of ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts quickly deactivated during the reactionregeneration process, while the spinel type of ZnxAlyO4 catalyst with a stabilized structure could almost recover the entire activity after being carbonized in air."
[2] "Liu et al. clearly defined the ZnO active constituents as main contributors to the exceptional dispersity and stability in the silicalite-1 supported ZnO catalyst. The catalyst with 5 wt% Zn presented the best propane conversion reaching 49% and high propene selectivity around 90% under a space velocity of 5000 ml g1 h1."
[3] "In addition, the inherent activity of a single Zn2+Ox species can be elevated by utilizing a TiO2 promoter."
[4] "The authors claimed that the introduction of Ti-related constituents could promote the desorption of coordination unsaturated active Zn sites (Zncus) and the migration of lattice oxygen, thus greatly improving the propene selectivity and catalyst stability."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was analyzed with a focus on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx. These materials showed structural properties and catalytic behavior that differed from traditional metal oxide supports. VOx-based catalysts, particularly those supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15, were noted for their ability to recover activity after being carbonized in air, indicating a stabilized structure. ZnO-supported catalysts, on the other hand, exhibited high conversion and selectivity under high space velocities, suggesting exceptional dispersity and stability. The introduction of TiO2 as a promoter was found to elevate the activity of a single Zn2+Ox species, enhancing the desorption of coordination unsaturated active Zn sites and promoting the migration of lattice oxygen. This resulted in improved propene selectivity and catalyst stability. Overall, the use of OMS supports provided advantageous catalytic performance in PDH reactions, particularly in terms of activity recovery, high conversion, and selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂的性能进行了分析，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx。这些材料表现出与传统金属氧化物支持不同的结构特性和催化行为。VOx基催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的催化剂，在空气碳化后能够恢复活性，表明具有稳定的结构。ZnO支持的催化剂在高空间速度下显示出高转化率和选择性，表明了出色的分散性和稳定性。引入TiO2作为促进剂可以提高单个Zn2+Ox物种的活性，增强协调非饱和活性Zn位点的脱附和晶格氧的迁移。这导致了丙烯选择性的提高和催化剂稳定性。总体而言，使用OMS支持提供了PDH反应中优势催化性能，特别是在活性恢复、高转化率和选择性方面的优势。
