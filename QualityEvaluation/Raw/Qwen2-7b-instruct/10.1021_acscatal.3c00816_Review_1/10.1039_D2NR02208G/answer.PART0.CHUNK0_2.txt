[1] "The authors found that the exposed active Zn species on the surface of ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts quickly deactivated during the reactionregeneration process, while the spinel type of ZnxAlyO4 catalyst with a stabilized structure could almost recover the entire activity after being carbonized in air."
[2] "Meanwhile, the content of Zrcus greatly affected the PDH performance (Fig. 11)."
[3] "The authors claimed that the introduction of Ti-related constituents could promote the desorption of coordination unsaturated active Zn sites (Zncus) and the migration of lattice oxygen, thus greatly improving the propene selectivity and catalyst stability."

1. The surface-exposed Zn species in ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts rapidly lose activity during the reaction and regeneration process, whereas ZnxAlyO4 catalysts with a stabilized spinel structure can largely restore their full activity after being treated with air.

2. The performance of the PDH process is significantly influenced by the content of coordination unsaturated Zr active sites (Zrcus) on the catalyst surface (Figure 11).

3. The addition of Ti-related components enhances the desorption of coordination unsaturated Zn sites (Zncus) and facilitates the migration of lattice oxygen, thereby substantially increasing propene selectivity and catalyst stability.

1. ZnO/Al2O3催化剂表面暴露的Zn物种在反应和再生过程中迅速失去活性，而具有稳定立方结构的ZnxAlyO4催化剂可以在空气处理后几乎恢复其全部活性。

2. PDH过程的表现受到催化剂表面协调不饱和Zr活性位点（Zrcus）含量的影响（图11）。

3. 添加Ti相关成分可以促进协调不饱和Zn位点（Zncus）的脱附和晶格氧的迁移，从而大幅提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。
