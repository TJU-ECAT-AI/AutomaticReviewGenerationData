[1] "The catalysts prepared by the seed-oriented growth strategy exhibit more efficient coking resistance in contrast to other mentioned methodologies. On the one hand, initial metallic nanoparticles could be trapped by the support due to the chemical bonding effect, which inhibits the agglomeration of the metallic species. Owing to the coating effect, the post-synthetic strategy leads to the formation of a protecting shell, which further protects metallic active species from transferring and gathering."

The Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show enhanced performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts feature advantageous structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The inclusion of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment plays a significant role in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. 

MCM-41 and SBA-15 support materials offer a unique advantage due to their mesoporous structure. This structure facilitates the formation of active components, such as VOx and CrOx, in a well-dispersed manner. The lattice oxygen species on these supports are crucial for the activation of the CH bond, leading to the efficient dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. 

Moreover, the use of MCM-41 and SBA-15 as supports allows for the immobilization of metallic nanoparticles, preventing their agglomeration and promoting their dispersion. This results in a more efficient use of active sites, enhancing the overall catalytic activity. 

H2 pretreatment can further optimize the performance of these catalysts. By introducing H2, the catalysts undergo a reduction process, which activates the surface metal sites and enhances their reactivity. This leads to a more efficient conversion of propane and a higher selectivity towards propylene.

In summary, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts demonstrate improved catalytic behavior in PDH reactions due to their unique structural properties and the presence of lattice oxygen species. H2 pretreatment further boosts their performance, making them promising alternatives to traditional metal oxide supports.
