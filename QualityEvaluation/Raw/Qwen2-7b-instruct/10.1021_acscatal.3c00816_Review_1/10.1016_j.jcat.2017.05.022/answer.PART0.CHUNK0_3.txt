<p>Vanadium loading ranges from 0.35 wt.% to 6.33 wt.% as determined by ICP-OES. Apparent V surface densities were calculated by relating the loading to the specific surface area of the catalysts. The obtained values are between 0.05 and 1.67 V nm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>For all catalysts, the apparent surface density of V is lower than the theoretical value for a monolayer of isolated VOx of 2.5 V nm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The reducibility of supported VOx species was studied by TPR experiments. The TPR profiles obtained over VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show that the temperature necessary to reduce oxidized VOx species changes with V loading.</p>
<p>Acidic properties of VOx supported on MCM-41 were studied by NH<sub>3</sub>-TPD experiments. It should be mentioned that bare MCM-41 is not acidic while VOx species on the surface of SiO<sub>2</sub> possess both Brnsted and Lewis character, with the former and the latter being acidic OH groups bond to V and reduced VOx species, respectively.</p>
<p>The amount of NH<sub>3</sub> adsorbed on the surface of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts increases with rising aggregation of VOx species. It is also obvious that the catalysts preheated at 550 C in an air flow adsorb much less NH<sub>3</sub> compared to the dried ones.</p>
<p>The TOF values are higher for isobutane conversion compared to propane DH. This may be due to lower activation energy for the former reaction caused by weaker C-H bond in the alkane feed.</p>
<p>Isolated VOx sites are established to show higher TOF in comparison with their aggregated counterparts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. V4+ and V3+ species were identified as catalytically active sites.</p>
<p>Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions. This is explained by stronger acidity of Lewis sites created upon partial reduction of single V5+ species under reaction conditions compared to polynuclear VOx species.</p>
<p>For isobutane DH, these sites have too strong Lewis acidity leading to reduced isobutene selectivity due to structural isomerization. Here, isolated VOx sites with balanced Lewis acidity that is strong enough to activate C-H bond of alkanes but not too strong to catalyze cracking and skeletal isomerization are preferable.</p>

1. The vanadium loading ranged from 0.35 wt.% to 6.33 wt.%, with apparent surface densities of V from 0.05 to 1.67 V nm<sup>2</sup>. The surface density of V was lower than the theoretical value for isolated VOx monolayer (2.5 V nm<sup>2</sup>). 

2. The temperature required to reduce oxidized VOx species varied with vanadium loading.

3. Both Brnsted and Lewis acidity were observed on the surface of VOx species supported on silica.

4. The amount of adsorbed NH<sub>3</sub> increased with the aggregation of VOx species.

5. Isobutane dehydrogenation had higher TOF than propane dehydrogenation due to weaker C-H bonds.

6. Isolated VOx sites showed higher activity in dehydrogenation reactions compared to aggregated sites.

7. Stronger Lewis acidity of isolated VOx sites led to reduced isobutene selectivity due to isomerization reactions.

8. Balanced Lewis acidity in isolated VOx sites was preferred for isobutane dehydrogenation to achieve high isobutene selectivity.

1. 钒负载范围为0.35 wt.%至6.33 wt.%，表面密度V从0.05至1.67 V nm<sup>2</sup>。V的表面密度低于理论值（单层VOx的2.5 V nm<sup>2</sup>）。

2. 氧化VOx物种的还原温度随钒装载量而变化。

3. 在二氧化硅表面，观察到了Brnsted和Lewis酸性。

4. NH<sub>3</sub>吸附量随着VOx物种的聚合度增加。

5. 环己烷脱氢反应的TOF高于丙烷脱氢反应，由于烷基键较弱。

6. 单独的VOx位点在脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性，与聚合位点相比。

7. 单独的VOx位点的强Lewis酸性导致环己烷选择性降低，因为发生了异构化反应。

8. 在环己烷脱氢反应中，平衡Lewis酸性单独的VOx位点更有利于实现高环己烯选择性。
