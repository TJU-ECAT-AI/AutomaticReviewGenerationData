[1] "Influence of the kind of VOx structures in VOx/MCM-41 on activity, selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane Highlights • VOx on MCM-41 with surface site density of 0.051.67 nm2 was prepared. • The catalysts were tested in dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane. • VOx species with Lewis-acidic V3+ or V4+ were identified as active sites. • TOF depends on aggregation degree of VOx species. • Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation."

[10] "The probability of forming such condensed species increases with increasing surface density of VOx species and is thus highest for 6.3V/MCM with a site density of 1.67 nm2 that comes close to 2.5 nm2 calculated for the highest possible surface coverage without interaction between the species."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. MCM-41 and SBA-15 are mesoporous silica materials with high surface areas and ordered pore structures, which facilitate better control over the catalyst's properties compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The VOx and CrOx species supported on these materials exhibit higher activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions. 

VOx species with Lewis-acidic V3+ or V4+ ions are identified as the active sites for PDH reactions. The catalytic activity depends on the aggregation degree of the VOx species. Isolated VOx species are found to be the most active and resistant to deactivation, whereas aggregated species are less active and more prone to deactivation due to the formation of coke precursors.

ZrO2-based bulk materials are noted as another promising type of catalyst for PDH reactions. Catalysts with supported VOx show good onstream stability and high selectivity, making them among the most promising options for PDH applications. When comparing different supports, VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 with a 110 wt.% Al2O3 content reveals higher propene productivity compared to VOx/SiO2 and VOx/Al2O3.

Studies on the structure of VOx species supported on silica materials have shown that reduced V4+ and V3+ species display Lewis acidity, which contributes to their catalytic activity. The selectivity of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in PDH reactions appears to be superior due to their ability to suppress coke formation. The structure of VOx species, including their aggregation degree and the presence of lattice oxygen species, influences their catalytic behavior and deactivation during PDH reactions.

H2 pretreatment of the catalysts can affect their performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. This pretreatment might alter the structure and reactivity of the VOx species, impacting their activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在分析。MCM-41和SBA-15是具有高比表面积和有序孔结构的介孔二氧化硅材料，与传统金属氧化物支撑相比，可以更好地控制催化剂的性质。这些材料上的VOx和CrOx物种在PDH反应中表现出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

被识别为PDH反应活性位点的VOx物种带有Lewis酸性的V3+或V4+离子。催化活性依赖于VOx物种的聚合程度。孤立的VOx物种被发现是最活跃的，并且对抗失活能力强，而聚合物种则活性较低且更易失活，由于形成了焦炭前体。

ZrO2基体材料被认为是另一种有前景的PDH催化剂类型。带有支持的VOx的催化剂显示出良好的在线稳定性以及高选择性，使其成为PDH应用中最有可能的选项之一。

当比较不同的支撑材料时，SiO2-Al2O3上带有110 wt.% Al2O3的VOx显示更高的异丁烯产率，与SiO2和Al2O3上的VOx相比。

对二氧化硅材料上VOx物种结构的研究表明，还原的V4+和V3+物种显示Lewis酸性，这有助于其催化活性。由于能够抑制焦炭形成，VOx/SiO2催化剂在PDH反应中的选择性似乎更高。

结构对VOx物种的行为和PDH反应中的失活产生影响，包括它们的聚合度和晶格氧物种的存在。H2预处理催化剂可能会影响它们在PDH反应中的性能和失活。这种预处理可能会改变VOx物种的结构和反应性，从而影响它们在PDH反应中的活性和选择性。
