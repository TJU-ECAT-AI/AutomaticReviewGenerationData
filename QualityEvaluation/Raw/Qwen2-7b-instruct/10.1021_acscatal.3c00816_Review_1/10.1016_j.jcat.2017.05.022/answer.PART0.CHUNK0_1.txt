<p>The catalysts were tested in dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane.</p>
<p>Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation.</p>
<p>Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ were identified as DH active sites.</p>
<p>TOF depends on aggregation degree of VOx species.</p>
<p>For both dehydrogenation reactions, a direct correlation between apparent turnover frequency and the mean number of VOV bonds around a central V cation was established.</p>
<p>However, selectivity over the former species in isobutane dehydrogenation is lower due to their higher Lewis acidity and, consequently, increased activity for skeletal isomerization of isobutene and for cracking reactions.</p>
<p>The reducibility of supported VOx species was studied by TPR experiments.</p>
<p>Acidic properties of VOx supported on MCM-41 were studied by NH3-TPD experiments.</p>
<p>The catalysts also differ in their onstream stability.</p>
<p>Cracking is catalyzed by acidic sites.</p>
<p>The same is true for isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes that is also catalyzed by acidic sites.</p>
<p>Moreover, TPD of adsorbed ammonia showed that catalysts with low loading of V possess stronger Lewis acidic sites than their higher-loaded counterparts.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the least selective catalyst in isobutane DH showed the lowest deactivation rate.</p>
<p>Following our argumentation in a previous paper, this surprising fact can be explained when looking at the mechanism of coke formation.</p>
<p>Single VOx sites, however, reveal high activity for cracking and isomerization (in case of isobutane DH) reactions.</p>

1. The catalysts were evaluated for their performance in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation reactions.
2. Isolated vanadium oxide (VOx) species demonstrated superior activity and resilience against deactivation.
3. Vanadium (V) species in the +3 and +4 oxidation states were recognized as active sites in dehydrogenation processes.
