[1] "Lower olefins are the basis of a wide range of chemical products such as polymers, solvents, paints, dyes, and other chemicals."
[2] "There are several processes employing Pt-Sn/Al2O3 (STAR by Phillips and Krupp-Uhde, Oleflex by UOP, PDH by Linde, BASF, Borealis and Statoil) or CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin by ABB Lummus, FDB by Snamprogetti and Yarsintez) catalysts."
[3] "However, in previous studies differently polymerized VOx species were deposited on the surface of supports with different acidic properties, and it was not possible to directly establish relationships between the structure of VOx species and their performance in coke formation."
[4] "This support has been shown to be inert for both alkane dehydrogenation and isomerization of butenes due to the lack of strong acidic sites."
[5] "In particular, we focused on elucidating whether and how the polymerization degree of VOx species affects their intrinsic DH activity, coke formation and, for isobutane DH, isomerization of this alkane and the corresponding olefin."
[6] "Generally, the TOF values are higher for isobutane conversion compared to propane DH."
[7] "For elucidating the influence of the degree of VOx aggregation on the acidity of such sites, we related the amount of NH3 desorbed to the overall content of vanadium in the catalyst."
[8] "The catalysts also differ in their onstream stability ( Fig. S6 )."
[9] "For both, propane and isobutane DH, the relative degree of deactivation increases with an increase in the number of VOV bonds ( Fig. 5 )."
[10] "Cracking is catalyzed by acidic sites, and this observation may be explained by the higher Lewis acidity of isolated VOx sites compared to aggregated ones."
[11] "Moreover, TPD of adsorbed ammonia showed that catalysts with low loading of V possess stronger Lewis acidic sites than their higher-loaded counterparts."
[12] "Therefore, isolated VOx species really are intrinsically more active than their oligomerized counterparts."
[13] "This is related to the strong Lewis acidity of single VOx sites."
[14] "Following our argumentation in a previous paper [21], this surprising fact can be explained when looking at the mechanism of coke formation."
[15] "Here, it is possible that two olefins adsorb close to each other and react to coke precursors."
[16] "On the other hand this mechanism is highly probable on VOx dimers or higher polymerized species thus causing blockage of active sites by coke."
[17] "In terms of catalyst development, an ideal catalyst for propane DH should possess isolated reduced VOx species because they possess highest TOF and show lowest deactivation rate."

1. Lower olefins serve as the foundation for various chemical products including polymers, solvents, paints, dyes, and other chemicals. 

2. Processes such as STAR (Phillips and Krupp-Uhde), Oleflex (UOP), PDH (Linde, BASF, Borealis, and Statoil), and Catofin (ABB Lummus, Snamprogetti, and Yarsintez) use catalysts like Pt-Sn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 for the production of lower olefins.

3. In previous studies, the structure of differently polymerized VOx species on surfaces with varied acidic properties made it challenging to directly correlate their performance in coke formation.

4. MCM-41 was found to be inactive in alkane dehydrogenation and isomerization of butenes due to the absence of strong acidic sites.

5. The research aimed to understand how the degree of polymerization of VOx species impacts their intrinsic dehydrogenation activity, coke formation, and isomerization of isobutane.

6. Isobutane dehydrogenation generally resulted in higher turnover frequencies compared to propane dehydrogenation.

7. By relating the amount of NH3 desorbed to the total vanadium content, the influence of VOx aggregation on acidity could be assessed.

8. Catalyst stability varied significantly depending on the type of catalyst.

9. The degree of deactivation increased with the number of VOV bonds in both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

10. The higher Lewis acidity of isolated VOx sites compared to aggregated ones was attributed to their role in cracking reactions.

11. Catalysts with low V loading exhibited stronger Lewis acidic sites than those with higher loading.

12. Isolated VOx species were inherently more active than their oligomerized counterparts.

13. The strong Lewis acidity of single VOx sites was linked to the inability to form coke through the simultaneous adsorption of two olefins.

14. Catalysts for propane dehydrogenation ideally should contain isolated reduced VOx species for optimal turnover frequency and minimal deactivation.

15. The mechanism of coke formation was explained by the probability of two olefins adsorbing closely and reacting to form precursors on VOx dimers or higher polymerized species.

16. These species blocked active sites, leading to deactivation.

17. For developing an effective catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, it is crucial to incorporate isolated reduced VOx species to achieve high turnover frequency and low deactivation rate.

1. 下游烯烃是聚合物、溶剂、油漆、染料和其他化学品等广泛化学产品的基础。

2. STAR（菲力浦和库普-乌德）、Oleflex（UOP）、PDH（林德、巴斯夫、博瑞利和斯托伊尔）和Catofin（ABB Lummus、Snamprogetti和Yarsintez）等过程使用Pt-Sn/Al2O3或CrOx/Al2O3催化剂生产下游烯烃。

3. 在先前的研究中，由于表面具有不同酸性性质的支持体上不同聚合度的VOx物种的存在，很难直接建立它们在焦炭形成性能方面的表现之间的关系。

4. MCM-41被证明对于烷基化氢解和丁烯异构化都是惰性的，原因是缺乏强酸性位点。

5. 研究旨在理解VOx物种聚合度对其非氧化脱氢活性、焦炭形成和异丁烷脱氢时此烷烃及其相应烯烃的异构化的影响。

6. 异丁烷脱氢通常比丙烷脱氢产生的转化率更高。

7. 通过将吸附的NH3量与催化剂中的总钒含量相关联，可以评估VOx聚集对酸性的影响。

8. 不同催化剂的稳定性存在显著差异。

9. 随着VOx物种聚合度的增加，两者均表现出更高的相对失活程度。

10. 引发裂解反应的酸性位点的更高Lewis酸性可以解释单个VOx位点的强Lewis酸性。

11. 催化剂中低V加载的物种显示比高加载物种更强的Lewis酸性。

12. 单独的VOx物种在内在活性上明显高于其聚集体。

13. 强Lewis酸性使得单个VOx位点难以形成焦炭，因为需要两个烯烃同时吸附到一起才能发生反应。

14. 对于丙烷脱氢而言，理想催化剂应包含孤立的还原VOx物种以实现最高转化频率并降低最小失活率。

15. 焦炭形成的机制是基于在VOx二聚体或更高聚合度物种上两个烯烃可能吸附并形成前体的可能性。

16. 这些物种堵塞了活性位点，导致失活。

17. 为了开发有效的丙烷脱氢催化剂，重要的是要整合孤立的还原VOx物种以实现高转化频率和低失活率。
