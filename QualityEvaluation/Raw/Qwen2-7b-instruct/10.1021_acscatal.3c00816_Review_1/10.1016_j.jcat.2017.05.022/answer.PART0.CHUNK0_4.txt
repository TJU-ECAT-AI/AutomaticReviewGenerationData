<p>In general, their performance is typically affected by the kind of support, the presence of dopant, and polymerization degree.</p>
<p>The reducibility of supported VOx species was studied by TPR experiments. The TPR profiles obtained over VOx/MCM-41 catalysts show that the temperature necessary to reduce oxidized VOx species changes with V loading.</p>
<p>Acidic properties of VOx supported on MCM-41 were studied by NH3-TPD experiments. It should be mentioned that bare MCM-41 is not acidic while VOx species on the surface of SiO2 possess both Brnsted [22] ,[31] and Lewis character [13] ,[23] ,[31] ,[33] , with the former and the latter being acidic OH groups bond to V and reduced VOx species, respectively.</p>
<p>For elucidating the influence of the degree of VOx aggregation on the acidity of such sites, we related the amount of NH3 desorbed to the overall content of vanadium in the catalyst.</p>
<p>Since low-loaded catalysts possess mainly isolated VOx sites it may be concluded that these structures have higher intrinsic activity compared to polynuclear species.</p>
<p>Besides activity, product selectivity is also influenced by the kind of VOx species. In particular, isolated sites are not selective for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene due to their high activity for cracking reactions and particularly isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes.</p>
<p>Following our argumentation in a previous paper [21] , this surprising fact can be explained when looking at the mechanism of coke formation. It is assumed that adsorbed olefins react with each other resulting in higher-molecular weight compounds that can be longer hydrocarbons or, after cyclization and dehydrogenation, aromatic compounds.</p>

1. The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by the type of support, the presence of dopants, and the degree of polymerization. 
2. The reducibility of supported VOx species varies with the Vanadium (V) loading, as shown by Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) experiments.
3. VOx species on the surface of MCM-41 exhibit both Brnsted and Lewis acidity, with Brnsted acidity attributed to OH groups bonded to V and Lewis acidity to reduced VOx species.
4. The acidity of VOx sites is affected by the degree of aggregation, as demonstrated by relating the amount of desorbed NH3 to the overall content of vanadium in the catalyst.
5. Catalysts with low V loading display higher intrinsic activity due to the presence of isolated VOx sites, which are more active than polynuclear species.
6. Product selectivity in PDH reactions is impacted by the type of VOx species, with isolated sites showing poor selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene due to their high reactivity in cracking and isomerization reactions.
7. The mechanism of coke formation involves the adsorption and reaction of olefins, which leads to the formation of higher molecular weight compounds that can be longer hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds after cyclization and dehydrogenation.

1. 金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受支撑类型、掺杂剂的存在以及聚合度的影响。
2. TPR实验显示，随着V负载的增加，支持的VOx物种的可还原性发生变化。
3. MCM-41表面的VOx物种具有Brnsted和Lewis酸性，Brnsted酸性归因于与V键合的OH基团，Lewis酸性归因于还原的VOx物种。
4. 通过将脱附的NH3量与催化剂中总的钒含量相关联，可以影响VOx位点的酸性。
5. 低V负载的催化剂显示出更高的内在活性，这归因于存在孤立的VOx位点，它们比聚核物种更活跃。
6. PDH反应中的产品选择性受到VOx物种类型的影响，孤立位点在异丁烷脱氢为异丁烯时表现出较低的选择性，因为它们在裂解和异构化反应中具有高反应性。
7. 焦炭形成的机制涉及烯烃的吸附和反应，导致形成更高分子量的化合物，这些化合物可以是更长的碳氢化合物或在环化和脱氢后转化为芳香化合物。
