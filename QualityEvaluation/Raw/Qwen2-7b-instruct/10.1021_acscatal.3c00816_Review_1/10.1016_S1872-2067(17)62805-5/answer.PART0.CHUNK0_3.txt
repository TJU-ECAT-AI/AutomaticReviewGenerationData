[1] "The effects of Sn addition on the pore structure of SBA-15 were determined based on N2 adsorption-desorption; the results are shown in Fig. 1 ."
[2] "The low-angle XRD patterns of SBA-15 and Sn-modified SBA-15 samples were similar, with three distinct peaks at 2θ = 0.94, 1.53, and 1.78, corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) reflections."
[3] "The introduction of Sn species produced strong interactions between Sn species and the support, resulting in large amounts of Sn in a stable oxidized form."
[4] "The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample showed the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%, and the lowest deactivation parameter (12.6%) after reaction for 6 h."

1. The pore structure of SBA-15 was studied using N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The results indicated that the addition of Sn altered the pore structure of SBA-15. 
2. The low-angle XRD patterns of SBA-15 and Sn-modified SBA-15 samples were comparable, featuring three distinctive peaks corresponding to the (100), (110), and (200) crystallographic orientations.
3. Incorporating Sn species into the SBA-15 support created strong interactions between Sn and the support, enabling the Sn to exist predominantly in a stable, oxidized state.
4. Among the catalysts tested, the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst demonstrated the highest propene selectivity, reaching 98.5%, alongside a propane conversion of approximately 43.8%. This catalyst also exhibited the least deactivation, with a deactivation parameter of 12.6% after a 6-hour reaction period.

1. 使用N2吸附脱附分析研究了SBA-15的孔结构。结果显示，Sn的添加改变了SBA-15的孔结构。
2. SBA-15和Sn改性SBA-15样品的低角XRD模式相似，具有三个特征峰，对应于（100）、（110）和（200）晶面。
3. 将Sn物种引入SBA-15支持中，在支持之间产生了强烈的相互作用，使Sn主要以稳定的氧化态存在。
4. 在测试的所有催化剂中，Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂表现出最高的丙烯选择性，达到98.5%，丙烷转化率约为43.8%。此外，该催化剂的失活参数最低，为12.6%，在6小时反应后。
