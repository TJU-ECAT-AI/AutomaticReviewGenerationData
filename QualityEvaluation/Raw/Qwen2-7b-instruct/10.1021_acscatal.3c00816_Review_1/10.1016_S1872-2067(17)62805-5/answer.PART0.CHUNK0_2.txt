1. The study analyzed the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically focusing on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The researchers compared these materials' structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports. They found that the incorporation of tin (Sn) into the SBA-15 matrix led to strong interactions between Sn species and the support, which helped maintain the oxidation states of Sn species during the reaction. This interaction improved the promotion efficiency of Sn compared to traditional impregnation methods. However, the study also noted that an excessive amount of Sn weakened the interactions among Pt species, Sn species, and the support, resulting in a decrease in the catalytic activity.

2. The study found that the Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 showed excellent catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation. The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample demonstrated the best propene selectivity, reaching 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of approximately 43.8%. The researchers suggested that the use of an oxidized Sn promoter could significantly enhance the catalytic performance while metallic Sn acted as a poison. The one-pot synthesis method proved to be more efficient in improving the Sn promoter's effectiveness compared to traditional impregnation techniques.

3. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influenced catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species were crucial for the stabilization of the metal particles and preventing their sintering, thus maintaining the catalyst's activity. H2 pretreatment helped to remove impurities and improve the catalyst's surface morphology, which further contributed to its performance. The study highlighted the importance of optimizing these factors to maximize the catalyst's efficiency and longevity in PDH reactions.

1. 研究重点分析了金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx。他们将这些材料的结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物支持进行了比较。研究发现，锡（Sn）在SBA-15中的掺入导致Sn物种与支撑之间的强烈相互作用，有助于维持反应期间Sn物种的氧化状态。这种相互作用提高了Sn的促进效率，相比传统的浸渍方法。然而，研究也指出，过量的Sn削弱了Pt物种、Sn物种和支持之间的相互作用，导致催化活性下降。

2. 研究发现，Sn掺入的SBA-15支持的Pt催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优秀的催化活性和稳定性。Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15样品的丙烯选择性最高，达到98.5%，相应的丙烷转化率为约43.8%。研究人员提出，使用氧化Sn促进剂可以显著提高催化性能，而金属Sn则作为毒物。一锅合成方法在提高Sn促进剂的有效性方面比传统浸渍方法更有效。

3. 影响PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的因素包括晶格氧物种和H2预处理。晶格氧物种对于稳定金属颗粒并防止其结块至关重要，从而保持催化剂的活性。H2预处理有助于去除杂质并改善催化剂表面形态，进一步提高了其性能。研究强调了优化这些因素的重要性，以最大化催化剂在PDH反应中的效率和寿命。
