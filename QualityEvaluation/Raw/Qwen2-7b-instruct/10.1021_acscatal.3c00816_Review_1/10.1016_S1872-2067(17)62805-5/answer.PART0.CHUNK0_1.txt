Answer: What is the impact of incorporating tin (Sn) into SBA-15 materials on the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in propane dehydrogenation?

The incorporation of tin (Sn) into the SBA-15 matrix significantly enhances the interaction between Sn species and the support. This leads to the maintenance of the oxidation states of Sn species during the reaction, which in turn improves the function and effect of the Sn promoter. As a result, the Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 exhibit better catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation compared to those on impregnated samples. However, an excessive amount of Sn can weaken the interactions between Sn species and the support, causing an increase in metallic Sn and negatively impacting catalytic performance. The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst demonstrates the best propene selectivity, reaching 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of approximately 43.8%, and the lowest deactivation parameter after 6 hours of reaction at 580°C.

引入锡（Sn）到SBA-15材料中显著提高了铂（Pt）催化剂在丙烷裂解中的催化性能。Sn物种与支撑之间的强相互作用维持了反应过程中Sn物种的氧化状态，这有助于促进Sn促进剂的功能和效果。因此，基于Sn掺杂SBA-15的Pt催化剂在丙烷裂解中的催化活性和稳定性优于浸渍样品。然而，过量的Sn会减弱Sn物种与支持之间的相互作用，导致金属Sn的增加，从而对催化性能产生负面影响。0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂显示出最佳的丙烯选择性，达到98.5%，相应的丙烷转化率为约43.8%，并且在580°C下反应6小时后的最低失活参数。
