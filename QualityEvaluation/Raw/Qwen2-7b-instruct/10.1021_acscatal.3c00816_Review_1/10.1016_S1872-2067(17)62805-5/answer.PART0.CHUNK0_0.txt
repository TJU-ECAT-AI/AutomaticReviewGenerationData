<p>Propane is an important raw material in the production of various chemicals and of great practical value in various reactions such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile syntheses.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Sn into the SBA-15 matrix led to strong interactions between Sn species and the support, and these helped to maintain the oxidation states of Sn species during the reaction.</p>
<p>The catalytic activities and stabilities of the Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 were better than those of the impregnated sample.</p>
<p>However, the catalytic performance deteriorated when an excessive amount of Sn was introduced and the interactions among Pt, Sn species, and the support became weaker.</p>
<p>The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst gave the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of Sn enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support.</p>
<p>No coke species were observed on the spent Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample, indicating a high anti-coking ability.</p>

1. 丙烷是生产各种化学品的重要原料，且在聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物和丙烯腈合成等反应中具有很高的实际价值。
2. 将Sn融入SBA-15矩阵后，Sn物种与支撑体之间产生了强大的相互作用，有助于维持反应过程中Sn物种的氧化状态。
3. 支撑在Sn整合SBA-15上的Pt催化剂比浸渍样品显示出更好的催化活性和稳定性。
4. 过量的Sn导致Pt、Sn物种和支撑体之间的相互作用减弱，催化剂性能下降。
5. Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂提供了最高的丙烯选择性（98.5%），相应的丙烷转化率为约43.8%。
6. 合适数量的Sn的引入增强了Sn物种与支撑体之间的相互作用。
7. Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂表现出高抗结焦能力，表面未观察到焦炭物种。
