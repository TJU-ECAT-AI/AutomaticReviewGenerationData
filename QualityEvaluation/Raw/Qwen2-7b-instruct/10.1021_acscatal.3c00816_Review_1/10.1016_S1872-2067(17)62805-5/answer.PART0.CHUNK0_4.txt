1. Propane plays a crucial role in the production of various chemicals, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile syntheses. It is of significant practical importance in these chemical processes.

2. Incorporating Sn promoters into Pt-based catalyst systems enhances their catalytic activity, resistance against coke formation, and operational lifespan. This is due to modifications in the catalyst properties through geometric and electronic effects.

3. An oxidized Sn promoter is believed to substantially improve catalytic performance, whereas metallic Sn can act as a poison.

4. Most methods for introducing Sn promoters involve traditional post-synthesis techniques, which often result in uneven distribution of Sn species and blockage of pores and channels, leading to a decrease in the surface area and efficiency of the promoter.

5. Using a one-pot synthesis method improves the efficiency of the Sn promoter compared to the conventional impregnation method.

6. Catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 exhibit outstanding catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation.

7. The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst demonstrated the highest propene selectivity at 98.5%, accompanied by a propane conversion of approximately 43.8%, along with the lowest deactivation parameter (12.6%) after 6 hours of reaction.

1. 烷烯在生产各种化学品，如聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物和丙烯腈合成中扮演着重要角色，并具有显著的实际价值。

2. 在铂基催化剂系统中引入Sn促进剂能有效提高催化活性、抗结焦能力及操作寿命。这是通过几何和电子效应对催化剂性质的修改实现的。

3. 氧化态Sn促进剂被认为能大幅提高催化性能，而金属态Sn则可能起到毒化作用。

4. 大多数引入Sn促进剂的方法涉及传统的后合成程序，这些方法往往导致Sn物种分布不均且堵塞孔道和通道，从而降低促进剂的表面积和效率。

5. 使用一锅法合成方法提高了Sn促进剂的效率，与传统浸渍方法相比。

6. 支撑在Sn掺杂SBA-15上的催化剂在烷烯脱氢反应中表现出卓越的催化活性和稳定性。

7. Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂在98.5%的最高丙烯选择性下，伴随着约43.8%的烷烯转化率，并且在6小时反应后的最低失活参数（12.6%）。
