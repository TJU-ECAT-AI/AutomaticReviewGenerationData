<p>Despite high initial propylene yields, Pt-based catalysts often encounter problems in the term of fast deactivation and poor propylene selectivity. The size of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) is a key factor affecting PDH conversion; a decreased size is favorable for exposing more accessible active sites on MNPs and thus improves the conversion of propane.</p>
<p>Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions.</p>
<p>The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C.</p>
<p>Significantly, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), the highest stability to date among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction.</p>
<p>We also found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can significantly improve the regeneration performance and the catalytic activity remained stable after four successive regeneration cycles.</p>

The document discusses the development of a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method for encapsulating subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The introduction of Zn species significantly improves the stability of the Pt clusters, providing a superhigh propylene selectivity of 99.3% with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and a specific activity of propylene formation of 65.5mol gPt1h1 (WHSV=108h1) at 550°C. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst shows extremely high stability without obvious deactivation even after 13000 min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), with a deactivation constant of 0.001h1, 200 times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions. The use of Cs+ ions in the zeolite improves the regeneration stability of the catalyst, allowing the catalytic activity to remain stable after four continuous cycles.

The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibits an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5 mol gPt1h1) at a WHSV of 108h1 and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at a WHSV of 3.654h1 at 550°C.

文档讨论了一种使用配体保护直接氢还原方法将亚纳米双金属铂锌簇封装在硅铝酸盐-1（S-1）沸石中的开发。引入Zn物种显著提高了铂簇的稳定性，提供了高达99.3%的丙烯选择性，重量小时空速（WHSV）为3.654h1和每克铂每小时丙烯形成特定活性为65.5mol gPt1h1（WHSV=108h1）在550°C下。PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂在13000分钟后表现出极高的稳定性，没有明显的失活，WHSV=3.6h1，解活常数为0.001h1，是相同条件下PtZn4/Al2O3对的200倍。在沸石中引入Cs+离子可以显著提高再生稳定性，使催化剂活性在四个连续周期后保持稳定。


PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂在108h1的WHSV下显示出极高的丙烯形成特定活性（65.5 mol gPt1h1）和在3.654h1的WHSV下的丙烯选择性为99.3%在550°C下。
