[1] "Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters."
[2] "The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C, and 40.4% propane conversion was retained even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2."
[3] "The Pt species are prone to sintering at high temperatures, especially in an oxidizing atmosphere;11 hence, avoiding the conventional calcination process and employing direct reduction method can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Pt species."
[4] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature does not provide a direct comparison with traditional metal oxide supports. However, it highlights the development of a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method for encapsulating subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 zeolites. This method effectively prevents sintering of metal nanoclusters during conventional calcination-reduction processes, leading to the formation of subnanometer metal clusters. The introduction of Zn species remarkably enhances the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, resulting in an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99.3% with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation of 65.5mol gPt1h1 (WHSV=108h1) at 550C. Even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2, the catalyst retains 40.4% propane conversion. The presence of Cs+ ions in the zeolite improves the regeneration stability, allowing the catalytic activity to remain unchanged after four successive regeneration cycles. The literature emphasizes the use of ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction for encapsulating subnanometer metal clusters inside zeolites, which leads to enhanced stability, selectivity, and regeneration performance in PDH reactions.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能时，文献并未直接与传统的金属氧化物支持进行比较。然而，它强调了一种通过配体保护的直接氢还原方法，用于将亚纳米尺寸的双金属PtZn簇封装到硅酸铝1型沸石中。这种方法在常规煅烧-还原过程中有效防止了金属纳米簇的聚集，导致形成亚纳米尺寸的金属簇。引入Zn物种显著提高了亚纳米Pt簇的稳定性，PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂在550°C、WHSV为3.654h1和丙烯生成特定活性达到65.5mol gPt1h1（WHSV=108h1）的情况下，展现出极高的丙烯选择性（99.3%），且在不补充H2的情况下，即使在13000min（WHSV=3.6h1）的连续运行中，仍能保留40.4%的丙烷转化率。在引入Cs+离子后，催化活性得到了显著改善，催化剂的活性在四次连续再生循环后保持不变。文献强调了使用配体保护的直接氢还原方法将亚纳米金属簇封装到沸石中，这导致了PDH反应中增强的稳定性和选择性以及再生性能。
