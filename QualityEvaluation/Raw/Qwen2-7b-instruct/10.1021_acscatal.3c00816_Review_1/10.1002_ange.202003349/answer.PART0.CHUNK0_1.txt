[1] "Significantly, the introduction of Zn species coupled with subnanometer Pt clusters remarkably improved the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."
[2] "Moreover, the CNs of the Pt-Zn bond further increased to 1.0 after 13000min on stream, indicating that more PtZn alloys were generated gradually as the reaction proceeded."
[3] "Note that the Pt-Zn bond with a CN of 0.6 can be observed in spent PtZn4@S-1-H sample after 1200min on stream, indicating the formation of more Pt-Zn alloys during the reactions."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. The introduction of Zn species into the Pt clusters remarkably enhances propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The CN of the Pt-Zn bond increases gradually as the reaction proceeds, indicating the formation of more Pt-Zn alloys. These alloys are responsible for the improved performance of the catalysts in PDH reactions.

对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。引入Zn物种到Pt簇中显著提高了丙烯选择性和催化稳定性。随着反应的进行，Pt-Zn键的CN逐渐增加，表明形成了更多的Pt-Zn合金。这些合金是催化剂在PDH反应中表现出改进性能的原因。
