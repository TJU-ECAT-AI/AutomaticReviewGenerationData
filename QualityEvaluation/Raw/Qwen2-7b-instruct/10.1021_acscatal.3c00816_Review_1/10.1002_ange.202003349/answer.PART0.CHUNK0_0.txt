<p>The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation was observed over PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions.</p>
<p>Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of catalysts, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four continuous cycles.</p>

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed in the literature. MCM-41 and SBA-15 are known for their ordered mesoporous structure and high surface area, which can potentially enhance the performance of metal oxide catalysts. The VOx and CrOx supported on these supports are compared to traditional metal oxide supports, highlighting the advantages and limitations in terms of catalytic behavior and reaction mechanisms. The literature discusses how factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The specific advantages of MCM-41 and SBA-15 over other supports are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but the text does highlight the benefits of incorporating Zn and Cs+ ions to improve stability and regeneration performance. The introduction of Zn species notably enhances the stability of Pt clusters, leading to high propylene selectivity and specific activity, with a WHSV of 3.654h1 and up to 65.5mol gPt1h1 at 550C. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst shows remarkable stability, with no deactivation observed even after 13000 minutes on stream at a WHSV of 3.6h1, and an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1. The addition of Cs+ ions further improves the regeneration stability of the catalysts, keeping the catalytic activity unchanged after four successive regeneration cycles.

文献分析了金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。MCM-41和SBA-15以其有序介孔结构和高比表面积而闻名，这可能增强金属氧化物催化剂的性能。在这些支持上负载的VOx和CrOx与传统金属氧化物相比，讨论了催化行为和反应机制的优势和限制。文献讨论了诸如晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素如何影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活。具体来说，MCM-41和SBA-15相对于其他支持的优势并未在提供的文本中明确提及，但文本确实强调了通过引入Zn和Cs+离子来提高稳定性和再生性能的好处。引入Zn物种显著提高了铂簇的稳定性，导致高丙烯选择性和特定活性，WHSV为3.654小时1和最高达到65.5mol gPt1小时1在550摄氏度下。PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂显示出出色的稳定性，即使在3.6小时1的WHSV下也未观察到任何降解，长达13000分钟，且具有极低的降解常数0.001小时1。添加Cs+离子进一步提高了催化剂的再生稳定性，保持催化活性不变，经过四次连续再生周期。
