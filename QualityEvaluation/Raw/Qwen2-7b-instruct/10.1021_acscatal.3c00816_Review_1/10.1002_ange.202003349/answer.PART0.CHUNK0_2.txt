[1] "Herein, we develop a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method for encapsulating subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite."
[2] "The introduction of Zn species significantly improved the stability of the Pt clusters and gave a superhigh propylene selectivity of 99.3% with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation of 65.5mol gPt1h1 (WHSV=108h1) at 550C."
[3] "Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions."
[4] "We also show that the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of catalysts, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four continuous cycles."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. The literature discusses the structural properties and catalytic behavior of these materials compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages and limitations of OMS catalysts are highlighted, including their ability to maintain high stability, superhigh propylene selectivity, and low deactivation constants. The introduction of Zn species significantly improves the stability of Pt clusters, achieving a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst shows remarkable stability, with no obvious deactivation observed after 13000 min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), and an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200 times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions. Additionally, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of catalysts, maintaining the catalytic activity after four successive regeneration cycles. This demonstrates the promise of OMS catalysts for future industrial applications in PDH reactions.

对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。文献讨论了这些材料与传统金属氧化物支持相比的结构特性和催化行为。OMS催化剂的优点和限制被强调，包括其保持高稳定性的能力、超高的丙烯选择性以及较低的失活常数。锌物种的引入显著提高了铂簇的稳定性，实现了在3.654小时1的重量小时空速（WHSV）下丙烯选择性为99.3%的结果。PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂显示出惊人的稳定性，在13000分钟后仍无明显失活（WHSV=3.6小时1），且具有极低的失活常数0.001小时1，这比在相同条件下PtZn4/Al2O3对应物的值低200倍。此外，向沸石中引入Cs+离子可以改善催化剂的再生稳定性，使其在四个连续循环后保持催化活性。这表明OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的工业应用前景。
