<p>The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively.</p>
<p>Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability.</p>
<p>The results showed that the type of carrier had a significant impact on catalytic activity and stability. It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area.</p>
<p>The pore size had the profound effects on porosity, particle size, the redox property, dispersion and surface chemical state etc. by applying N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, XRD, HRTEM, TPR, H2-chemisorption, XPS and in situ CO-DRIFT etc. techniques.</p>
<p>The catalytic reaction results obtained on the similar PtSn-supported on (metal-doped) silicious molecular sieves were collected and gathered in Table 7, it could be found, regardless of the differences in reaction conditions, that our results in present work was comparable to those achieved on PtSn/Fe-S1 catalyst.</p>
<p>The crystallite size of metallic Pt in reduced and spent catalysts were estimated using Scherrer's equation. The particle size distributed differently depending on the varied pore size of catalyst.</p>
<p>As a result, the highest initial propane conversion of 46.9% was achieved on PtSn/SSF#8. Additionally, the pore size of catalyst also showed its impacts on catalytic deactivation due to the sintering of active phase and coke deposition.</p>

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. The literature discusses how these catalysts compare to traditional metal oxide supports in terms of structural properties and catalytic behavior. The advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of MCM-41 and SBA-15 are highlighted. The influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is explored. The text emphasizes the importance of pore size in affecting the redox property, dispersion, and surface chemical state of the catalysts. The results indicate that the type of carrier has a significant impact on catalytic activity and stability. Platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier demonstrate better performance compared to those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carriers. The pore size of the catalyst plays a crucial role in determining its catalytic performance, with smaller pore sizes being more conducive to converting propane. The highest initial propane conversion of 46.9% is achieved on PtSn/SSF#8. Additionally, the pore size of the catalyst influences its catalytic deactivation due to the sintering of active phase and coke deposition.
