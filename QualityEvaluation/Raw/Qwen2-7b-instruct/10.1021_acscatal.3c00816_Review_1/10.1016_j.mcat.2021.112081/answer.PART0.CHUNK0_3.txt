[1] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 [6] are used in the two processes, respectively."
[2] "The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction."
[3] "The pore size had the profound effects on porosity, particle size, the redox property, dispersion and surface chemical state etc. by applying N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, XRD, HRTEM, TPR, H2-chemisorption, XPS and in situ CO-DRIFT etc. techniques."
[4] "The catalytic deactivation was mainly caused by sintering of active phase and coke deposition which was identified and quantified by combining Raman and TG analysis."
[5] "The pore size of catalyst showed it important role in improving the coke resistance, the best performance was obtained on sample PtSn/SSF#8."
[6] "As a result, the highest initial propane conversion of 46.9% was achieved on PtSn/SSF#8. Additionally, the pore size of catalyst also showed its impacts on catalytic deactivation due to the sintering of active phase and coke deposition."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports offer advantages in terms of ordered pore structures, higher thermal stability, and higher specific surface areas, which benefit the dehydrogenation reaction. The pore size of the supports plays a critical role in determining the catalyst's performance. Specifically, the pore size affects the porosity, particle size, redox properties, dispersion, and surface chemical states of the active components.

Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For instance, lattice oxygen species can participate in the redox reactions and affect the stability of the active sites. H2 pretreatment can help reduce the active sites, leading to the stabilization of the catalysts and improvement in the dehydrogenation efficiency.

The pore size of the catalysts is crucial for improving coke resistance. The study found that the catalyst with the best performance was the one with a pore size of 8 nm, which resulted in the highest initial propane conversion of 46.9%. This catalyst also exhibited the lowest coke deposition. The sintering of active sites and coke deposition were identified as the main causes of catalyst deactivation. The pore size of the catalyst influenced these phenomena, demonstrating its significant role in the catalytic process.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到其结构特性和催化行为的影响，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比。MCM-41和SBA-15支持体提供了优势，包括有序的孔结构、更高的热稳定性和更高的比表面积，这些特性有利于脱氢反应。支持的孔径对催化剂的性能起着关键作用，影响着孔隙度、颗粒尺寸、还原性、分散性和表面化学状态等活性成分。

晶格氧物种和H2预处理可以影响催化剂在PDH反应中的性能和失活。例如，晶格氧物种可以参与还原反应，并影响活性位点的稳定性。H2预处理有助于减少活性位点，从而实现催化剂的稳定化和脱氢效率的提升。

催化剂的孔径对于提高焦炭抵抗性至关重要。研究发现，孔径为8nm的催化剂具有最佳性能，导致最高初始丙烷转化率为46.9%。该催化剂还表现出最低的焦炭沉积。活性位点的聚集和焦炭沉积被确定为催化剂失活的主要原因。催化剂的孔径影响这些现象，表明它在催化过程中的重要角色。
