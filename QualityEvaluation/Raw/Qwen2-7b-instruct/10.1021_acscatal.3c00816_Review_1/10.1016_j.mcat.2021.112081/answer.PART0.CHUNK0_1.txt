1. The pore size had significant impacts on multiple properties of the catalysts, including porosity, particle size, redox properties, dispersion, and surface chemical states. These effects were studied using a variety of techniques such as nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), hydrogen chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ CO diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (CO-DRIFT).

2. The primary cause of catalytic deactivation was sintering of the active phase and coke deposition. These phenomena were quantified using Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TG).

3. The optimal pore size for achieving the highest propane conversion and the lowest coke deposition was found to be 8 nanometers, corresponding to the catalyst sample PtSn/SSF#8.

4. The pore size played a crucial role in enhancing coke resistance. The best performance was observed on the PtSn/SSF#8 catalyst sample.

5. The highest initial propane conversion rate of 46.9% was achieved using the PtSn/SSF#8 catalyst.

6. The pore size of the catalyst influenced the deactivation process, specifically due to the sintering of the active phase and coke deposition.
