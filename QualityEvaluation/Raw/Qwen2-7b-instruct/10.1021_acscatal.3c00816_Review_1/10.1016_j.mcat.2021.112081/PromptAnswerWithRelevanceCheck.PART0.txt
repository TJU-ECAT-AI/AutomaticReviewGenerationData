The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The mesoporous materials like MCM-41 and SBA-15 offer several advantages over traditional supports. They possess ordered pore structures, higher thermal stability, and a higher specific surface area, which are beneficial for the dehydrogenation reaction. The presence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can significantly impact the catalyst's performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

For instance, the pore size plays a crucial role in enhancing the coke resistance of the catalyst. As the pore size increases, the coke deposition decreases, leading to better catalytic stability. The study found that the sample PtSn/SSF#8, with a pore size of 8nm, exhibited the best performance in terms of propane conversion, achieving a high initial conversion of 46.9%. This was due to the small size of the active phase, which was more conducive to converting propane both initially and at the end of the reaction.

Furthermore, the redox properties of the catalysts are significantly affected by the pore size. Samples like PtSn/SSF#5, despite having the best dispersion of active phases (77.2%), consumed the least hydrogen (101.2 μmol/gcat.) and exhibited the lowest reduction behavior. This indicates that while dispersion is critical for activity, the pore size also impacts the reduction efficiency of the catalyst.

The XPS analysis further substantiated these findings by showing that the metallic Pt0 and In0 fractions gradually increased with an increase in pore size. This implies that the interaction between the support and metal species is influenced by the pore size, which affects the catalyst's stability and activity.

In conclusion, the choice of carrier, pore size, and the presence of lattice oxygen species play significant roles in determining the catalytic performance of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions. The results suggest that the optimized combination of these factors can lead to highly active and stable catalysts with improved resistance to coke deposition and sintering of active sites.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到其结构特性和催化行为的影响，与传统金属氧化物支持相比。像MCM-41和SBA-15这样的介孔材料提供了多种优势超过传统的支持。它们具有有序的孔结构、更高的热稳定性和更高的比表面积，这对脱氢反应有利。介晶氧物种和H2预处理可以显著影响催化剂的性能和在PDH反应中的失活。

例如，孔径大小在提高催化剂的焦炭抵抗性方面起着关键作用。随着孔径的增加，焦炭沉积减少，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。研究发现，样品PtSn/SSF#8，具有8nm的孔径，表现出最佳的性能，在丙烷转化率上达到了46.9%的高初始转化率。这是由于活性相的小尺寸，更有利于丙烷的初始和最终转换。

此外，催化剂的还原性质受孔径大小的影响。如PtSn/SSF#5这样的样本，尽管具有最佳的活性相分散度（77.2%），消耗的氢气最少（101.2 μmol/gcat.），并且表现出最低的还原行为。这表明虽然分散性对于活性至关重要，但孔径也影响了催化剂的还原效率。

进一步的XPS分析证实了这些发现，显示随着孔径增大，金属Pt0和In0的含量逐渐增加。这表明支持与金属物种之间的相互作用受孔径影响，这会影响催化剂的稳定性和活性。

总之，选择载体、孔径以及介晶氧物种的选择在确定OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的催化性能中起着重要作用。结果表明，通过优化这些因素的组合可以导致高度活跃且稳定的催化剂，具有增强的焦炭沉积抵抗力和活性位点的烧结。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports offer advantages in terms of ordered pore structures, higher thermal stability, and higher specific surface areas, which benefit the dehydrogenation reaction. The pore size of the supports plays a critical role in determining the catalyst's performance. Specifically, the pore size affects the porosity, particle size, redox properties, dispersion, and surface chemical states of the active components.

Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For instance, lattice oxygen species can participate in the redox reactions and affect the stability of the active sites. H2 pretreatment can help reduce the active sites, leading to the stabilization of the catalysts and improvement in the dehydrogenation efficiency.

The pore size of the catalysts is crucial for improving coke resistance. The study found that the catalyst with the best performance was the one with a pore size of 8 nm, which resulted in the highest initial propane conversion of 46.9%. This catalyst also exhibited the lowest coke deposition. The sintering of active sites and coke deposition were identified as the main causes of catalyst deactivation. The pore size of the catalyst influenced these phenomena, demonstrating its significant role in the catalytic process.

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that these catalysts offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports. The structural properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15, characterized by their ordered pore structures, higher thermal stability, and larger specific surface areas, lead to improved catalytic activity and stability in PDH reactions. 

SBA-15, in particular, is favored due to its unique pore structure, thickness of pore walls, and better thermal stability compared to other mesoporous materials like MCM-41 and SBA-3. The introduction of metal additives such as VOx and CrOx enhances the catalyst's performance by altering the lattice oxygen species and promoting the desired reaction pathways.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Adequate H2 pretreatment helps in reducing the metal oxides, leading to the formation of active metal sites. However, excessive H2 exposure can also lead to the sintering of active sites and carbon deposition, which negatively impacts the catalyst's performance over time.

In terms of deactivation, factors such as sintering of active metal sites and coke deposition are critical. The pore size of the catalyst supports has a significant impact on the sintering process. Smaller pore sizes facilitate better dispersion of metal species, leading to smaller and more stable metal particles. This results in higher initial conversion rates of propane. Conversely, larger pore sizes promote faster sintering of active sites and may also increase the rate of coke deposition, leading to deactivation.

The results indicate that MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Factors such as lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, and pore size play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's activity, stability, and deactivation behavior.

分析金属有序微孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。我们发现，这些催化剂在与传统金属氧化物支持相比时提供了几个优势。

MCM-41和SBA-15的结构特性，包括其有序孔结构、更高的热稳定性以及更大的比表面积，导致PDH反应中催化活性和稳定性的提高。

特别是，由于其独特的孔结构、孔壁厚度和更好的热稳定性，SBA-15与其他材料如MCM-41和SBA-3相比更受欢迎。引入金属添加剂，如VOx和CrOx，通过改变晶格氧物种并促进所需反应路径来增强催化剂的性能。

H2预处理在PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活方面起着关键作用。适当的H2预处理有助于减少金属氧化物，形成活性金属位点。然而，过多的H2暴露也可能导致活性位点聚集，并增加碳沉积速率，从而影响催化剂的性能。

在催化剂失活方面，活性金属位点聚集和焦炭沉积是关键因素。支持催化剂的孔径大小对聚集过程有显著影响。较小的孔径有助于更好地分散金属物种，导致更小且更稳定的金属颗粒。这导致更高的丙烷初始转化率。相反，较大的孔径可能加速活性位点的聚集速度，并且也可能增加焦炭沉积速率，导致催化剂失活。

结果表明，MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中提供优于传统金属氧化物支持的性能。晶格氧物种、H2预处理和孔径大小等因素在确定催化剂活性、稳定性和失活行为方面起着关键作用。
