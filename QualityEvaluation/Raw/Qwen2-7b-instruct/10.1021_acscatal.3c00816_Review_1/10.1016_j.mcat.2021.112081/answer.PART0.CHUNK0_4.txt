Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, we find that these catalysts offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports. The structural properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15, characterized by their ordered pore structures, higher thermal stability, and larger specific surface areas, lead to improved catalytic activity and stability in PDH reactions. 

SBA-15, in particular, is favored due to its unique pore structure, thickness of pore walls, and better thermal stability compared to other mesoporous materials like MCM-41 and SBA-3. The introduction of metal additives such as VOx and CrOx enhances the catalyst's performance by altering the lattice oxygen species and promoting the desired reaction pathways.

H2 pretreatment plays a crucial role in catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Adequate H2 pretreatment helps in reducing the metal oxides, leading to the formation of active metal sites. However, excessive H2 exposure can also lead to the sintering of active sites and carbon deposition, which negatively impacts the catalyst's performance over time.

In terms of deactivation, factors such as sintering of active metal sites and coke deposition are critical. The pore size of the catalyst supports has a significant impact on the sintering process. Smaller pore sizes facilitate better dispersion of metal species, leading to smaller and more stable metal particles. This results in higher initial conversion rates of propane. Conversely, larger pore sizes promote faster sintering of active sites and may also increase the rate of coke deposition, leading to deactivation.

The results indicate that MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer improved performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Factors such as lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, and pore size play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's activity, stability, and deactivation behavior.

分析金属有序微孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。我们发现，这些催化剂在与传统金属氧化物支持相比时提供了几个优势。

MCM-41和SBA-15的结构特性，包括其有序孔结构、更高的热稳定性以及更大的比表面积，导致PDH反应中催化活性和稳定性的提高。

特别是，由于其独特的孔结构、孔壁厚度和更好的热稳定性，SBA-15与其他材料如MCM-41和SBA-3相比更受欢迎。引入金属添加剂，如VOx和CrOx，通过改变晶格氧物种并促进所需反应路径来增强催化剂的性能。

H2预处理在PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活方面起着关键作用。适当的H2预处理有助于减少金属氧化物，形成活性金属位点。然而，过多的H2暴露也可能导致活性位点聚集，并增加碳沉积速率，从而影响催化剂的性能。

在催化剂失活方面，活性金属位点聚集和焦炭沉积是关键因素。支持催化剂的孔径大小对聚集过程有显著影响。较小的孔径有助于更好地分散金属物种，导致更小且更稳定的金属颗粒。这导致更高的丙烷初始转化率。相反，较大的孔径可能加速活性位点的聚集速度，并且也可能增加焦炭沉积速率，导致催化剂失活。

结果表明，MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中提供优于传统金属氧化物支持的性能。晶格氧物种、H2预处理和孔径大小等因素在确定催化剂活性、稳定性和失活行为方面起着关键作用。
