The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The mesoporous materials like MCM-41 and SBA-15 offer several advantages over traditional supports. They possess ordered pore structures, higher thermal stability, and a higher specific surface area, which are beneficial for the dehydrogenation reaction. The presence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can significantly impact the catalyst's performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

For instance, the pore size plays a crucial role in enhancing the coke resistance of the catalyst. As the pore size increases, the coke deposition decreases, leading to better catalytic stability. The study found that the sample PtSn/SSF#8, with a pore size of 8nm, exhibited the best performance in terms of propane conversion, achieving a high initial conversion of 46.9%. This was due to the small size of the active phase, which was more conducive to converting propane both initially and at the end of the reaction.

Furthermore, the redox properties of the catalysts are significantly affected by the pore size. Samples like PtSn/SSF#5, despite having the best dispersion of active phases (77.2%), consumed the least hydrogen (101.2 μmol/gcat.) and exhibited the lowest reduction behavior. This indicates that while dispersion is critical for activity, the pore size also impacts the reduction efficiency of the catalyst.

The XPS analysis further substantiated these findings by showing that the metallic Pt0 and In0 fractions gradually increased with an increase in pore size. This implies that the interaction between the support and metal species is influenced by the pore size, which affects the catalyst's stability and activity.

In conclusion, the choice of carrier, pore size, and the presence of lattice oxygen species play significant roles in determining the catalytic performance of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions. The results suggest that the optimized combination of these factors can lead to highly active and stable catalysts with improved resistance to coke deposition and sintering of active sites.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到其结构特性和催化行为的影响，与传统金属氧化物支持相比。像MCM-41和SBA-15这样的介孔材料提供了多种优势超过传统的支持。它们具有有序的孔结构、更高的热稳定性和更高的比表面积，这对脱氢反应有利。介晶氧物种和H2预处理可以显著影响催化剂的性能和在PDH反应中的失活。

例如，孔径大小在提高催化剂的焦炭抵抗性方面起着关键作用。随着孔径的增加，焦炭沉积减少，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。研究发现，样品PtSn/SSF#8，具有8nm的孔径，表现出最佳的性能，在丙烷转化率上达到了46.9%的高初始转化率。这是由于活性相的小尺寸，更有利于丙烷的初始和最终转换。

此外，催化剂的还原性质受孔径大小的影响。如PtSn/SSF#5这样的样本，尽管具有最佳的活性相分散度（77.2%），消耗的氢气最少（101.2 μmol/gcat.），并且表现出最低的还原行为。这表明虽然分散性对于活性至关重要，但孔径也影响了催化剂的还原效率。

进一步的XPS分析证实了这些发现，显示随着孔径增大，金属Pt0和In0的含量逐渐增加。这表明支持与金属物种之间的相互作用受孔径影响，这会影响催化剂的稳定性和活性。

总之，选择载体、孔径以及介晶氧物种的选择在确定OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的催化性能中起着重要作用。结果表明，通过优化这些因素的组合可以导致高度活跃且稳定的催化剂，具有增强的焦炭沉积抵抗力和活性位点的烧结。
