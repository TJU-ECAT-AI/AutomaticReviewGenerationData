<p>Compared with the Ru supported on conventional Al2O3-Con catalyst, Nano-flower sheet-like Al2O3 with rich Al3+penta stabilizing Ru catalyst exhibited higher propane total oxidation performance and lower activation energy (Ea), which should be mainly attributed to the anchoring effect of a large amount of Al3+penta greatly promote the dispersion of Ru species.</p>
<p>Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst shows excellent recycling performance and outstanding resistance to water, sulfur and carbon dioxide, which is also mainly attributed to the structural effect of NF-Al2O3 and the stabilizing effect of Al3+penta for Ru-CeOx active units and the electronic valence state of Ru0.</p>
<p>The catalytic total oxidation of propane over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst conformed the MvK mechanism and the O derived from the Ru-CeOx interface participates in the entire redox cycle.</p>

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is enhanced when compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The introduction of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment significantly influences catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The structural properties of OMS catalysts, such as their ordered mesopores, provide superior dispersion of transition metal oxides, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species contribute to the redox chemistry at the metal oxide surface, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Hydrogen pretreatment can stabilize the metal oxide surface, preventing the formation of surface oxides that could lead to deactivation. This results in a more efficient use of the catalyst, higher productivity, and longer lifetime compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The reaction mechanisms involve the utilization of lattice oxygen for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with the formation of propene and hydrogen as the major products. The enhanced performance of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is attributed to their unique structural features, which promote the dispersion of metal oxides and maintain the activity of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能与传统的金属氧化物支持相比有所提高。在PDH反应中，介孔氧物种和氢（H2）预处理对催化剂性能和失活有显著影响。OMS催化剂的结构特性，如其有序介孔，提供了过渡金属氧化物的优越分散，从而在PDH反应中提高了活性和选择性。介孔氧物种参与了金属氧化物表面的氧化还原化学，促进了脱氢过程。氢预处理可以稳定金属氧化物表面，防止表面氧化物的形成，导致催化剂失效。这导致催化剂使用更有效、更高产率和更长寿命，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比。PDH反应的增强性能归因于OMS催化剂的独特结构特征，这些特征促进金属氧化物的分散并保持催化剂表面在反应条件下的活性。
