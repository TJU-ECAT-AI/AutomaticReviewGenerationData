The document discusses the use of gamma phase alumina (γ-Al2O3) as an efficient carrier in thermal catalysis due to its large specific surface area and high thermodynamic and chemical stability. The introduction of the Ru-CeOx interface enhances the catalytic activity for propane total oxidation. Even with a low content of CeO2 (1.0 wt.%), the catalytic activity is significantly improved. The document also states that the catalytic activity of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 is higher than that of Ru-Ce7/Al2O3-Con. Additionally, it notes that the specific surface areas (SBET) of Al2O3-Con and NF-Al2O3 are high, with Al2O3-Con having 186 m2 g1 and NF-Al2O3 having 195 m2 g1. Lastly, the document suggests that Al2O3 with rich unsaturated penta-coordinate Al3+ could be suitable for catalytic total oxidation of other volatile organic compounds.

文档讨论了γ-Al2O3作为热催化中高效载体的应用，由于其较大的比表面积和高热力学和化学稳定性。引入Ru-CeOx界面可以提高丙烷总氧化性能。即使CeO2含量仅为1.0 wt.%，催化剂的活性也显著提高。文档还指出，Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3的活性高于Ru-Ce7/Al2O3-Con。此外，文档提到Al2O3-Con和NF-Al2O3的比表面积（SBET）很高，分别为186 m2 g1和195 m2 g1。最后，文档建议具有丰富五配位Al3+的Al2O3可能适合催化其他挥发性有机化合物的总氧化。
