The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is compared with traditional metal oxide supports. The analysis highlights several key aspects:

1. Nano-flower sheet-like Al2O3 with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ was synthesized, demonstrating a significant improvement in the stabilization of Ru-CeOx active sites. This structure is crucial for enhancing the propane total oxidation performance, as evidenced by the reduced activation energy (Ea).

2. The introduction of NF-Al2O3 with Al3+penta stabilizes the electronic valence state of Ru, contributing to the catalyst's enhanced performance. This is a notable advantage over traditional metal oxide supports.

3. The design of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts showcases exceptional recycling performance and outstanding resistance to water, sulfur, and carbon dioxide. These attributes are attributed to the structural effects of NF-Al2O3 and the stabilizing effect of Al3+penta on Ru-CeOx active units and the electronic valence state of Ru0.

4. The catalytic total oxidation of propane over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts adheres to the Mars-van-Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, indicating an efficient redox cycle involving oxygen species from the Ru-CeOx interface. 

5. The Al2O3 with rich unsaturated penta-coordinate Al3+ might be a superior support for catalytic total oxidation of other volatile organic compounds, offering potential for broader applications in chemical synthesis and environmental remediation.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，与传统金属氧化物支持进行比较。分析强调了几方面的关键点：

1. 合成了富含不饱和五配位Al3+的纳米花状片状Al2O3，这显著提高了Ru-CeOx活性位点的稳定化能力。这种结构对于增强丙烷总氧化性能至关重要，表现为降低了活化能（Ea）。

2. 富含Al3+penta的NF-Al2O3能够稳定Ru的电子价态，这是与传统金属氧化物支持相比的优势所在。

3. 设计的Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3催化剂展现出出色的循环性能和对水、硫和二氧化碳的卓越抵抗性。这些特性归因于NF-Al2O3的结构效应和Al3+penta对Ru-CeOx活性单元以及Ru0表面物种的稳定作用。

4. 在Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3催化剂上进行的催化总氧化遵循了马斯-范克里夫伦（MvK）机制，表明氧物种从Ru-CeOx界面参与了整个还原氧化循环。

5. 具有丰富不饱和五配位Al3+的Al2O3可能是一种更优的支持，用于其他挥发性有机化合物的催化总氧化，这为化学合成和环境修复提供了更广泛的潜在应用。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is enhanced when compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The introduction of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment significantly influences catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The structural properties of OMS catalysts, such as their ordered mesopores, provide superior dispersion of transition metal oxides, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species contribute to the redox chemistry at the metal oxide surface, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Hydrogen pretreatment can stabilize the metal oxide surface, preventing the formation of surface oxides that could lead to deactivation. This results in a more efficient use of the catalyst, higher productivity, and longer lifetime compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The reaction mechanisms involve the utilization of lattice oxygen for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with the formation of propene and hydrogen as the major products. The enhanced performance of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is attributed to their unique structural features, which promote the dispersion of metal oxides and maintain the activity of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. The text does not provide a direct comparison between OMS catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports, nor does it discuss the structural properties and catalytic behavior of MCM-41 and SBA-15 in PDH reactions. It focuses on the performance of a nano-flower sheet-like alumina spheres (NF-Al2O3) with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ for propane total oxidation. The text mentions that the 90% conversion temperature (T90) and the apparent activation energy (Ea) of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 are 207°C and 56.7 kJ/mol, respectively. It also highlights the superior water, sulfur, and carbon dioxide resistance and recycling performance of the catalyst. The catalytic performance is attributed to the rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites in NF-Al2O3 that anchor the Ru-CeOx active species. The Al3+penta sites enhance the dispersion of Ru-CeOx active species and stabilize the electronic valence state of Ru0. The degradation of propane over the catalyst follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism through two different pathways.

The text does not provide information on how factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, nor does it compare these factors between OMS catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports. Therefore, the text does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question regarding the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 in PDH reactions, nor does it discuss the impact of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation.
