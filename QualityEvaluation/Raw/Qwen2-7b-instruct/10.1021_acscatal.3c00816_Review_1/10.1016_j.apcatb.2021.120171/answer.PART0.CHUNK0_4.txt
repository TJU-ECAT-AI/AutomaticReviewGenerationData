The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. The text does not provide a direct comparison between OMS catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports, nor does it discuss the structural properties and catalytic behavior of MCM-41 and SBA-15 in PDH reactions. It focuses on the performance of a nano-flower sheet-like alumina spheres (NF-Al2O3) with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ for propane total oxidation. The text mentions that the 90% conversion temperature (T90) and the apparent activation energy (Ea) of Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3 are 207°C and 56.7 kJ/mol, respectively. It also highlights the superior water, sulfur, and carbon dioxide resistance and recycling performance of the catalyst. The catalytic performance is attributed to the rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites in NF-Al2O3 that anchor the Ru-CeOx active species. The Al3+penta sites enhance the dispersion of Ru-CeOx active species and stabilize the electronic valence state of Ru0. The degradation of propane over the catalyst follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism through two different pathways.

The text does not provide information on how factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, nor does it compare these factors between OMS catalysts and traditional metal oxide supports. Therefore, the text does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question regarding the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 in PDH reactions, nor does it discuss the impact of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。文本没有提供OMS催化剂与传统金属氧化物支持之间的直接比较，也没有讨论MCM-41和SBA-15在PDH反应中的结构特性和催化行为。它专注于用于丙烷总氧化的纳米花状片状氧化铝球（NF-Al2O3）富含未饱和五配位Al3+的性能。文本提到Ru-Ce7/NF-Al2O3的90％转化温度（T90）和显着活化能（Ea）分别为207°C和56.7 kJ/mol。还强调了催化剂的出色水、硫和二氧化碳抗性以及可回收性。催化性能归因于NF-Al2O3丰富的未饱和五配位Al3+位点可以锚定Ru-CeOx活性物种。Al3+penta位点增强了Ru-CeOx活性物种的分散，并稳定了Ru0的电子价态。丙烷在催化剂上的降解遵循马斯-范克雷文机制通过两个不同的途径。

文本没有提供关于晶格氧物种和H2预处理如何影响催化剂性能和脱活在PDH反应中催化剂的影响的信息，也没有将这些因素之间的比较提供给OMS催化剂和传统金属氧化物支持。因此，文本没有提供对MCM-41和SBA-15在PDH反应中的性能进行全面回答，也没有讨论晶格氧物种和H2预处理对催化剂性能和脱活的影响。
