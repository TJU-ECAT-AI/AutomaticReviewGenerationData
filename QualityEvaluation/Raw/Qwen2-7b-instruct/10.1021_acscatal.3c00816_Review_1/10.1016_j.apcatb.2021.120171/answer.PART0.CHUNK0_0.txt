The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is compared with traditional metal oxide supports. The analysis highlights several key aspects:

1. Nano-flower sheet-like Al2O3 with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ was synthesized, demonstrating a significant improvement in the stabilization of Ru-CeOx active sites. This structure is crucial for enhancing the propane total oxidation performance, as evidenced by the reduced activation energy (Ea).

2. The introduction of NF-Al2O3 with Al3+penta stabilizes the electronic valence state of Ru, contributing to the catalyst's enhanced performance. This is a notable advantage over traditional metal oxide supports.

3. The design of Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts showcases exceptional recycling performance and outstanding resistance to water, sulfur, and carbon dioxide. These attributes are attributed to the structural effects of NF-Al2O3 and the stabilizing effect of Al3+penta on Ru-CeOx active units and the electronic valence state of Ru0.

4. The catalytic total oxidation of propane over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalysts adheres to the Mars-van-Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, indicating an efficient redox cycle involving oxygen species from the Ru-CeOx interface. 

5. The Al2O3 with rich unsaturated penta-coordinate Al3+ might be a superior support for catalytic total oxidation of other volatile organic compounds, offering potential for broader applications in chemical synthesis and environmental remediation.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，与传统金属氧化物支持进行比较。分析强调了几方面的关键点：

1. 合成了富含不饱和五配位Al3+的纳米花状片状Al2O3，这显著提高了Ru-CeOx活性位点的稳定化能力。这种结构对于增强丙烷总氧化性能至关重要，表现为降低了活化能（Ea）。

2. 富含Al3+penta的NF-Al2O3能够稳定Ru的电子价态，这是与传统金属氧化物支持相比的优势所在。

3. 设计的Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3催化剂展现出出色的循环性能和对水、硫和二氧化碳的卓越抵抗性。这些特性归因于NF-Al2O3的结构效应和Al3+penta对Ru-CeOx活性单元以及Ru0表面物种的稳定作用。

4. 在Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3催化剂上进行的催化总氧化遵循了马斯-范克里夫伦（MvK）机制，表明氧物种从Ru-CeOx界面参与了整个还原氧化循环。

5. 具有丰富不饱和五配位Al3+的Al2O3可能是一种更优的支持，用于其他挥发性有机化合物的催化总氧化，这为化学合成和环境修复提供了更广泛的潜在应用。
