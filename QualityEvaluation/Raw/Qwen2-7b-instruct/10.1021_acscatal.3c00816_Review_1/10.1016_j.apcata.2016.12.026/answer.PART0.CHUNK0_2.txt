<p>As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid etc.</p>
<p>Since the traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention.</p>
<p>The acidity on the PtSn catalyst hinders the desorption of olefins product and extend the retention time on catalyst surface, leading to the further conversion and carbon deposition due to secondary dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions.</p>
<p>It was proposed that Sn promoter decreased the size of surface Pt ensembles, therefore restraining the deep dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the electronic effect of Sn can either favor the charge transfer from Snn+ to Pt or create a disparate electronic environment in Pt-Sn alloys.</p>
<p>The introduction of alkaline metal and alkaline earth metal in the published literature was mostly loaded through the post-synthesis procedure.</p>
<p>This process needed two stages calcination to get the final product, which could cause a non-uniform dispersion of Mg component on the support and a loss in the efficiency of the Mg promoter.</p>
<p>The differences between these samples on structure-activity relationships were identified and discussed.</p>
<p>The textural properties of the samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption and the corresponding isotherms and pore size distributions are shown in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>There was no MgO particles observed on the 2Mg-SBA-15 material surface or pores, indicating the well dispersion of magnesium on the support.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the Mg-decorated samples, no large aggregates of the metals on the external surface were observed, indicating a high distribution throughout the pores of Pt and Sn metallic particles.</p>
<p>The results suggested that the modification of Mg could markedly influence metallic nanoparticles distribution.</p>
<p>The presence of Mg dramatically restrained the reduction of Sn species and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which was favorable to form the M2 sites.</p>
<p>These results were well in accordance with propene selectivity in Fig. 10(b).</p>
<p>For the spent PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, some porous channels were blocked by the deposited carbonaceous species, resulting in the activity loss.</p>
<p>It was clear that for the spent PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, most of carbon deposits covered the active metal and only a small proportion of them located the external surface of the carrier.</p>
<p>In addition, it was important to note that the combustion temperature for the coke on Mg-modified catalysts shifted to the lower temperature, suggesting that the deposited carbon on the surface of metal became more active.</p>
<p>These phenomena suggested that the presence of Mg in the catalyst promoted the migration of the coke deposits from the metal sites to the support.</p>
<p>While excessive Mg weakened the Sn-support interaction and decreased the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>In our experiment, the PtSn catalysts with 14 wt.% Mg dopant exhibited better catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation than PtSn/SBA-15 sample.</p>
<p>The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 sample with 2 wt.% Mg synthesized by one-pot method showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a propane conversion of 43.0% and a propene selectivity of 99%.</p>

Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

Advantages:
- MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer well-defined and ordered mesoporous structures, which enhance the dispersion of metal nanoparticles and prevent agglomeration.
- The introduction of alkaline and alkaline earth metals through the one-pot synthesis method improves the dispersion of metal particles and strengthens interactions between metal species and support, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
- Suitable magnesium content stabilizes the oxidation states of tin species, enhancing the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.

Limitations:
- Post-synthesis loading of promoters often results in non-uniform dispersion and a loss of promoter efficiency.
- Excessive magnesium loading can weaken the interaction between tin and support, leading to decreased catalytic performance.

Reaction Mechanisms:
- The acidity of the catalyst hinders olefin desorption, prolonging retention time and promoting further conversion and carbon deposition.
- Tin promoters decrease the size of surface Pt ensembles, inhibiting deep dehydrogenation reactions.
- Electronic effects of tin can facilitate charge transfer or create a disparate electronic environment in Pt-Sn alloys.

Factors Influencing Performance:
- Lattice oxygen species affect the acidity of the catalyst, impacting olefin desorption and carbon deposition.
- H2 pretreatment can influence metal dispersion and interactions, affecting catalyst stability and performance.

Conclusion:
- MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts demonstrate improved catalytic activity and stability in PDH reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports.
- The one-pot synthesis method offers advantages in dispersion and interaction optimization.
- Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
