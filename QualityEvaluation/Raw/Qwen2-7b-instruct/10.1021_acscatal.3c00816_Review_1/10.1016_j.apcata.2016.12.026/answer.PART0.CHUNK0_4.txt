The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was analyzed. The SBA-15 materials with magnesium incorporation showed better mesoporous structure stability and magnesium species distribution compared to impregnation methods. Incorporation of magnesium modified the metallic phase structure and strengthened the interactions between platinum, tin species, and support. The magnesium facilitated the transfer of carbon deposits from active metal sites to the support surface. The presence of magnesium enhanced the tin-support interaction and stabilized the oxidation states of tin, improving catalyst performance. Excessive magnesium weakened the tin-support interaction, negatively impacting catalytic activity. The PtSn catalysts with 14 wt.% magnesium dopant exhibited better catalytic activity than the PtSn/SBA-15 sample. The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 sample, synthesized via the one-pot method with 2 wt.% magnesium, showed the highest catalytic activity with a 43.0% propane conversion and 99% propene selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx的性能进行了分析。含镁的SBA-15材料显示出比浸渍方法更好的多孔结构稳定性和镁物种分布。镁的引入修改了金属相结构，并加强了铂、锡物种与支撑之间的相互作用。镁促进了活性金属沉积物从金属位点转移到支撑表面。镁的存在增强了锡支撑之间的相互作用并稳定了锡的氧化状态，从而提高了催化剂的性能。过量的镁减弱了锡支撑之间的相互作用，负面影响了催化活性。含14wt.%镁掺杂的PtSn催化剂表现出优于PtSn/SBA-15样品的催化活性。通过一锅法制备的含2wt.%镁的PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15样品，在43.0%的丙烷转化率和99%的丙烯选择性方面显示出了最高的催化活性。
