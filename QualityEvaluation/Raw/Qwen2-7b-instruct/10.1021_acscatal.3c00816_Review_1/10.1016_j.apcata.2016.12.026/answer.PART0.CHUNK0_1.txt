<p>Compared with the sample synthesized by the impregnation method, the xMg-SBA-15 materials showed a better Mg species distribution and higher specific surface area.</p>
<p>The physicochemical properties of the supports and catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, TEM, NH3-TPD, XPS, H2-TPD and TG-DTA techniques.</p>
<p>The one-pot synthesized Mg-SBA-15 exhibited more stable mesoporous structure of SBA-15 and better Mg species distribution compared to Mg/SBA-15-IM from the impregnation method.</p>
<p>It was found that incorporation of appropriate amount of Mg modified the structural characteristics of the metallic phase and strengthened the interactions between platinum, tin species and support.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the presence of magnesium facilitated the transfer of the carbon deposits from the active metal to the support surface.</p>
<p>In addition, the existence of Mg enhanced the Sn-support interaction and stabilized the oxidation states of Sn, which would heighten the effect of tin promoter.</p>
<p>While excessive Mg weakened the Sn-support interaction and decreased the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The PtSn catalysts with 14 wt.% Mg dopant exhibited better catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation than PtSn/SBA-15 sample.</p>
<p>The PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 sample with 2 wt.% Mg synthesized by one-pot method showed the most excellent catalytic activity with a propane conversion of 43.0% and a propene selectivity of 99%.</p>
<p>The TG-DTA profiles of spent catalysts revealed that for the spent PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, most of carbon deposits covered the active metal and only a small proportion of them located the external surface of the carrier.</p>
<p>However, not only the catalyst acidity but also the high proportion of M1 active sites on the catalyst surface was responsible for the coking reaction.</p>
