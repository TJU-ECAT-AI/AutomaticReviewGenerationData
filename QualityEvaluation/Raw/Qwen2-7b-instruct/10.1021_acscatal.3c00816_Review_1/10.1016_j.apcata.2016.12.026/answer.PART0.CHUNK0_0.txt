Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

Advantages and limitations of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports lie in their ordered mesoporous structure. This structure provides high surface area and uniform pore size, enhancing the dispersion of metal species and improving their access to reactants. The introduction of alkaline earth metals like magnesium (Mg) through a one-pot synthesis method improves the dispersion of metal particles, strengthens the interaction between the metal and support, and reduces the risk of carbon deposition. 

Magnesium incorporation modifies the metal phase structure, stabilizes the oxidation state of tin (Sn), and facilitates the migration of coke deposits from active metal sites to the support surface. This enhances the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. However, excessive magnesium can weaken the interaction between Sn and support, reducing the catalytic performance. 

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and deactivation. In PDH reactions, the presence of oxygen leads to the formation of metal oxides, which can inhibit the reaction by blocking active sites. H2 pretreatment can reduce the oxygen content on the catalyst surface, thereby improving the deactivation resistance and increasing the selectivity of propene production. 

In summary, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer superior performance in PDH reactions due to their ordered mesoporous structure, enhanced metal dispersion, and improved interaction between metal species and support. Factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence the catalyst's performance and deactivation, with careful optimization leading to increased selectivity and activity.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。将它们与传统金属氧化物支持进行比较，讨论其结构特性和催化行为的优势、局限性以及反应机制。因素如晶格氧物种和H2预处理如何影响催化剂性能和PDH反应中的失活？

MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中与传统金属氧化物支持相比，其优势在于其有序介孔结构。这种结构提供高比表面积和均匀孔径，增强金属物种的分散并提高它们对反应物的接近度。通过一锅合成方法引入碱土金属，如镁（Mg），可以改善金属粒子的分散，加强金属与支撑之间的相互作用，并降低碳沉积的风险。

镁的引入修改了金属相结构，稳定了锡（Sn）的氧化状态，并促进了活性金属颗粒从活性金属位点到支撑表面的碳沉积迁移。这增强了催化剂的活性和稳定性。然而，过量的镁可能会减弱Sn与支撑的相互作用，从而降低催化性能。

晶格氧物种在PDH反应中的存在对催化活性和失活起着关键作用。晶格氧可能导致金属氧化物的形成，这会通过阻塞活性位点来抑制反应。H2预处理可以通过减少催化剂表面的氧含量来改进失活抵抗性和增加丙烯选择性。

综上所述，MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂由于其有序介孔结构、增强的金属分散和改善的金属物种与支撑之间的相互作用而表现出优于PDH反应的性能。因素如晶格氧物种和H2预处理显著影响催化剂的性能和失活，通过精心优化可以提高选择性和活性。
