The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

All these characterization techniques indicate that, at 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species. At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. 

Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr). 

Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction.

In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.

Based on ex situ and in situ characterization results and catalytic data, it appears that the activity of the Cr species is different in xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites.

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, were analyzed for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). The results showed that at 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, while γ-Al2O3 contains a fraction of oligomers along with isolated species. At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, while γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity. Catalysts with exclusively isolated Cr species (1 wt% Cr) exhibited higher activity and selectivity than those dominated by α-Cr2O3 particles. Among xCrAl2O3, catalysts with oligomeric species showed the highest activity, highlighting their importance in PDH reactions. In situ XAS studies confirmed that active Cr sites are generated on-site during the reaction, and Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state. The activity of Cr species varies between xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3, with isolated Cr(III) sites on SBA-15 being more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of α-Cr2O3. In contrast, oligomeric Cr species on xCrAl2O3 are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites. These findings suggest that the nature and distribution of Cr species significantly impact the catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

在金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的性能进行了分析。这些催化剂通过氮气物理吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、紫外拉曼光谱、扫描透射电子显微镜能量色散X射线光谱（STEMEDXS）和X射线吸收光谱（XANES和EXAFS）进行了表征。结果表明，在1 wt% Cr的情况下，SBA-15包含四面体（ ）配合的孤立Cr(VI)物种，而γ-Al2O3包含部分寡聚物以及孤立物种。在5 wt% Cr的情况下，SBA-15主要由结晶α-Cr2O3颗粒组成，而γ-Al2O3主要由具有不同核度的寡聚物组成。仅含孤立Cr物种（1 wt% Cr）的催化剂比主要由α-Cr2O3颗粒组成的催化剂表现出更高的活性和选择性。在xCrAl2O3中，含有寡聚物的催化剂显示出最高的活性，突出了它们在PDH反应中的重要性。原位XAS研究表明，活性Cr位点在反应期间现场生成，并且Cr通常处于（III）氧化状态。Cr物种在xCrSBA-15和xCrAl2O3之间的活动性存在差异，孤立Cr(III)位点在SBA-15上比α-Cr2O3表面的Cr位点更活跃、选择性和稳定。相反，xCrAl2O3上的寡聚Cr物种比孤立Cr位点更具活性和选择性。这些发现表明，Cr物种的性质和分布显著影响PDH反应的催化性能。
