<p>The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).</p>
<p>All these characterization techniques indicate that, at 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species.</p>
<p>At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.</p>

The study aimed to elucidate the nature and distribution of chromium species in catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation. The catalysts were characterized using various methods including N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction, UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. At 1 wt% chromium, SBA-15 contained isolated chromium(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination, whereas γ-Al2O3 had a mix of oligomers including dimers along with isolated species. At 5 wt% chromium, SBA-15 was dominated by crystalline chromium(III) oxide particles, while γ-Al2O3 had mainly oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species, but no chromium(III) oxide particles.

研究旨在阐明用于丙烷脱氢的催化剂中的铬物种的性质和分布。使用各种方法对催化剂进行了表征，包括氮气物理吸附、X射线衍射、紫外拉曼光谱、扫描透射电子显微镜、能量色散X射线光谱和X射线吸收光谱。在1 wt%的铬中，SBA-15包含四面体配合的孤立的铬(VI)物种，而γ-Al2O3含有包括二聚体在内的寡聚物以及孤立的物种。在5 wt%的铬中，SBA-15主要由结晶性铬(III)氧化物颗粒组成，而γ-Al2O3主要含有具有不同核度的寡聚物和部分孤立物种，但没有铬(III)氧化物颗粒。
