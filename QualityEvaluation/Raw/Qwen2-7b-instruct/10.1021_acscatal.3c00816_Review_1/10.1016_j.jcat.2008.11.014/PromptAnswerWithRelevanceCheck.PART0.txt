The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

All these characterization techniques indicate that, at 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains exclusively uniform distribution of chromium as isolated Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral ( ) coordination, whilst on γ-Al2O3 a fraction of oligomers (including dimers) is present along with isolated species. At 5 wt% Cr, SBA-15 is dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, besides a fraction of isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination. Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles. 

Among xCrSBA-15 catalysts, those containing exclusively isolated Cr species (i.e., 1 wt% Cr) exhibit higher activity and selectivity with respect to per mole of Cr than the catalyst dominated by crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles (5 wt% Cr). The intrinsic activity of these isolated Cr species is higher than those observed on γ-Al2O3 (1 wt% Cr). 

Interestingly, among xCrAl2O3, the catalysts dominated by oligomeric species show the highest activity, indicating the important role of the species in the reaction.

In situ XAS studies evidence that active Cr sites are apparently generated on-site during the reaction and that Cr is typically in (III) oxidation state.

Based on ex situ and in situ characterization results and catalytic data, it appears that the activity of the Cr species is different in xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3. For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites.

在金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的性能进行了分析。这些催化剂通过氮气物理吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、紫外拉曼光谱、扫描透射电子显微镜能量色散X射线光谱（STEMEDXS）和X射线吸收光谱（XANES和EXAFS）进行了表征。结果表明，在1 wt% Cr的情况下，SBA-15包含四面体（ ）配合的孤立Cr(VI)物种，而γ-Al2O3包含部分寡聚物以及孤立物种。在5 wt% Cr的情况下，SBA-15主要由结晶α-Cr2O3颗粒组成，而γ-Al2O3主要由具有不同核度的寡聚物组成。仅含孤立Cr物种（1 wt% Cr）的催化剂比主要由α-Cr2O3颗粒组成的催化剂表现出更高的活性和选择性。在xCrAl2O3中，含有寡聚物的催化剂显示出最高的活性，突出了它们在PDH反应中的重要性。原位XAS研究表明，活性Cr位点在反应期间现场生成，并且Cr通常处于（III）氧化状态。Cr物种在xCrSBA-15和xCrAl2O3之间的活动性存在差异，孤立Cr(III)位点在SBA-15上比α-Cr2O3表面的Cr位点更活跃、选择性和稳定。相反，xCrAl2O3上的寡聚Cr物种比孤立Cr位点更具活性和选择性。这些发现表明，Cr物种的性质和分布显著影响PDH反应的催化性能。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was studied comprehensively. The structure-property relationships and catalytic behavior of these materials were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The key findings are as follows:

1. SBA-15 supports predominantly isolated chromium (VI) species in coordination at 1 wt% Cr loading, while γ-Al2O3 supports a mixture of isolated and oligomeric species, including dimers, at the same loading. 
2. At 5 wt% Cr loading, SBA-15 yields crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles, whereas γ-Al2O3 forms oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity without Cr2O3 particles. 
3. In situ XAS studies revealed that chromium is in a high oxidation state of (III) during PDH reactions, indicating its active role in the process.
4. Catalysts with 1 wt% Cr loading on SBA-15 display higher activity and selectivity compared to those with 5 wt% Cr loading on the same support, due to the presence of isolated Cr(III) species with coordination numbers greater than four. 
5. Catalysts with 1 wt% Cr loading on γ-Al2O3 show activity and selectivity comparable to those on SBA-15, but the oligomeric species are more active than the isolated Cr species. 

These findings highlight the importance of support type and Cr species distribution on catalyst performance in PDH reactions. The nature of active Cr sites is influenced by the support structure and Cr content, leading to distinct catalytic behaviors.

Advantages of using OMS catalysts over traditional metal oxides include enhanced stability, controlled Cr species distribution, and improved activity and selectivity due to their ordered mesoporous architecture. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can affect catalyst performance by altering Cr oxidation state, coordination environment, and resistance to deactivation through coke formation.

Limitations include potential Cr leaching and the complexity of controlling Cr species distribution during synthesis. H2 pretreatment can help prevent Cr oxidation and improve catalyst stability by promoting the formation of more stable Cr(III) sites. However, the effectiveness of these strategies depends on the specific support material and reaction conditions.

Reaction mechanisms involve the interaction of Cr species with propane molecules, leading to the formation of propylene and coke. The presence of active Cr(III) sites with appropriate coordination environments facilitates the dehydrogenation process, while the structure of the support influences the accessibility and stability of these sites. Oligomeric species, in particular, exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity, likely due to their unique coordination environments and interactions with the support.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了全面研究。与传统的金属氧化物支持材料比较，这些材料的结构特性和催化行为进行了对比。关键发现如下：

1. 在1 wt% Cr加载下，SBA-15主要支持孤立的六价铬物种在配合中，而γ-Al2O3支持的物种混合包括孤立和寡聚体，包括二聚体。
2. 在5 wt% Cr加载下，SBA-15产生晶格α-Cr2O3粒子，而γ-Al2O3形成具有不同核度的寡聚体，没有Cr2O3粒子。
3. 在原位XAS研究中揭示，铬在PDH反应期间处于（III）高氧化状态，表明其在过程中的活性作用。
4. 与SBA-15上5 wt% Cr负载相比，SBA-15上的1 wt% Cr负载催化剂显示出更高的活性和选择性，由于存在配位数大于四的孤立Cr(III)物种。
5. 在γ-Al2O3上1 wt% Cr负载的催化剂显示活动性和选择性与SBA-15上的相似，但寡聚体物种比孤立的Cr物种更活跃。

这些发现强调了支持类型和Cr物种分布对PDH反应催化剂性能的影响。OMS催化剂的优势在于增强稳定性、控制Cr物种分布以及通过其有序介孔结构提高活性和选择性。因素如晶格氧物种和H2预处理可以影响催化剂性能，通过改变Cr的氧化状态、配合环境和防止焦炭形成导致的失活。

局限性包括Cr的可能泄漏以及在合成过程中控制Cr物种分布的复杂性。H2预处理有助于防止Cr氧化并提高催化剂稳定性，通过促进形成更稳定的Cr(III)位点。然而，这些策略的有效性取决于特定的支持材料和反应条件。

反应机制涉及Cr物种与丙烷分子的相互作用，导致丙烯和焦炭的形成。存在的活性Cr(III)位点及其适当的配合环境促进了脱氢过程，而支持结构影响这些位点的可访问性和稳定性。特别是寡聚体物种由于其独特的配合环境和与支持的相互作用而表现出增强的活性和选择性。
