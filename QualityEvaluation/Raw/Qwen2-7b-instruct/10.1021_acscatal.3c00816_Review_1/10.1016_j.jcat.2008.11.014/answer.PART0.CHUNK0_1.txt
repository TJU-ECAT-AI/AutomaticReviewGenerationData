[1] "The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function."

[2] "Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles."

[3] "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3."

[4] "In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites."

1. The study focused on understanding the nature and distribution of chromium species in catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, specifically xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts prepared through incipient wetness impregnation.

2. γ-Al2O3 catalysts predominantly contained oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity, alongside a portion of isolated species, without forming Cr2O3 particles.

3. In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination numbers above four demonstrated higher activity, selectivity, and stability compared to Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.

4. Contrary to xCrSBA-15, oligomeric Cr species on xCrAl2O3 exhibited greater activity and selectivity than isolated Cr sites.

1. 研究专注于理解用于丙烷脱氢的催化剂中铬物种的性质和分布，特别是通过浸渍湿法准备的xCrSBA-15和xCrAl2O3催化剂。

2. γ-Al2O3催化剂主要包含具有不同核度的寡聚体以及部分孤立物种，没有形成Cr2O3颗粒。

3. 在xCrSBA-15中，协调数大于四的孤立Cr(III)位点比表面晶型Cr2O3上的Cr位点表现出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

4. 相反，在xCrAl2O3中，寡聚态Cr物种比孤立的Cr位点在活性和选择性方面表现出更大的优势。
