[3] "In contrast, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites for DHP."
[4] "For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3."

1. At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 supports merely isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination, while γ-Al2O3 supports isolated sites along with a fraction of oligomers (including dimers).

2. γ-Al2O3 supports mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.

3. Oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites for DHP reactions.

4. In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.

5. The intrinsic catalytic activity of Cr species, whether isolated or oligomers, depends on the support (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they have been stabilized, as evidenced by the catalytic results.

1. 在1 wt% Cr时，SBA-15支持仅孤立的Cr(VI)物种在配合物中，而γ-Al2O3支持孤立的站点以及一部分寡聚体（包括二聚体）。

2. γ-Al2O3主要支持具有不同核度的寡聚体和一部分孤立物种，但没有Cr2O3颗粒。

3. 寡聚态Cr物种对于DHP反应比孤立的Cr物种更活跃、更选择性。

4. 在xCrSBA-15中，协调数大于四的孤立Cr(III)站点比表面的晶态Cr2O3颗粒上的Cr站点更活跃、更选择性、更稳定。

5. Cr物种（无论是孤立的还是寡聚体）的内在催化活性取决于它们被稳定的支持（SBA-15或Al2O3），这一点从催化结果中得到证据。
