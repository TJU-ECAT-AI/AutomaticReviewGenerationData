Abstract
Highly dispersed chromium (Cr)-based catalysts are promising candidates for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). However, the easier aggregation of Cr species into crystalline Cr2O3 at the high-temperature calcination and reaction process is a big challenge, which severely restricts the improvement of activity and stability of the DHP reaction. Herein, a flowing-air-induced transformation method was first proposed, and the catalytic performance of the prepared Cr/MCM-41 catalysts was found to be significantly improved compared to that of the Cr-based catalyst prepared by the traditional calcination method, even better than that of most of the reported Cr-based catalysts and some noble metal-based catalysts. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy as well as other characterization techniques demonstrated that the in situ calcination in flowing air could not only effectively restrain the conversion of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) but also largely improve the dispersion of Cr species. Furthermore, DHP activity is found to have a positive correlation with the amount of monomeric Cr(VI) species, which is proved to be the precursor of active coordinatively unsaturated Cr sites. Our proposed flowing-air-induced transformation method provides a general strategy for preparing the highly dispersed Cr-based catalysts and other metal oxide materials with varied valence and exhibits potential application prospects in industry.

1. Introduction
Propene, as a typical species of light olefins, is one of the significant building blocks in the chemical and petrochemical (rubber and polymer) industries, and the corresponding demand and production have attained a positive growth in recent years. (1) The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is an effective method to produce propene and receives significant attention because it is an on-purpose technique that only produces special propene without other products (CO, etc.). (1) Every year, there are five million tons of propene produced by the DHP technique. (1)
A high-performance catalyst is the key to realize catalytic DHP. Various kinds of materials, including platinum (Pt)-, indium (In)-, calcium (Ca)-, molybdenum (Mo)-, vanadium (V)-, and chromium (Cr)-based catalysts, have been reported for the DHP reaction, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are widely used in commercial processes. (1,2) Compared to Pt-based catalysts, Cr-based catalysts have the distinct superiority in terms of economy as well as comparable catalytic performances. Cr2O3 was reported as the first DHP catalyst in 1933. (3) Nevertheless, the low surface area and high crystallization of Cr2O3 hamper the catalytic activity. Then, CrOx-based catalysts are considered to exhibit higher catalytic activity owing to the unsaturated coordination properties and have been the commercial material for DHP. However, in general, the low selectivity toward propene and the poor stability of CrOx-based catalysts still limits their further applications due to the presence of two major challenges in the DHP reaction as follows.
On the one hand, the controversy on which kind of Cr(VI) is the precursor of the active Cr(III) species restricts the use of the effective method. In the early studies, some authors correlated the concentration of the Cr(VI) species with DHP activity and confirmed that the Cr(VI) species is the active species in dehydrogenation. (4) Nevertheless, when the reaction gas is introduced, the Cr(VI) species is rapidly consumed, at this time, the CrOx catalyst still shows high DHP activity, suggesting that the Cr(VI) species is not likely the real active site. Thus, most groups demonstrated that the reduced Cr(III and II) species with a coordinatively unsaturated form are the catalytically active centers for the DHP reaction, (1,5) while the Cr(VI) species is actually proved as the precursor of the active Cr(III) species. (1) At present, the detailed form of the Cr(VI) species for high DHP activity is still controversial. There are several types of Cr(VI) species presented in Cr-based catalysts, including isolated, oligomeric, polymeric, crystalline, amorphous, and so on. Different kinds of Cr(VI) species might make a different contribution for DHP. It is reported that the isolated Cr species shows the optimal catalytic activity when using SBA-15 as a support. (6) Other authors considered that when Al2O3 is used as a support, the oligomeric Cr species possesses the highest DHP activity. (6) Moreover, Yi et al. reported that polymeric Cr species is easier to reduce than the isolated Cr species, and the initial composition of the polymeric Cr species mainly affects the catalytic activity. (5)
On the other hand, a simultaneous controlled and facile method to obtain the highly dispersed Cr-based catalyst with rich active sites for the DHP reaction is a challenge. At present, the popular methods for synthesizing Cr-based catalysts include the hydrothermal synthesis, (7,8) the sol–gel method assisted with a surfactant and/or a solvent, (5,9,10) and the impregnation method. (6,11) The hydrothermal synthesis can control effectively the size and dispersion of the Cr species through parameters including temperature, time, and raw material ratio. Nevertheless, this method requires harsh preparation conditions and a long time (high pressures and temperatures in a confined space), which restricts its large-scale industrial application. For instance, Groppo et al. prepared an MCM-41-supported Cr catalyst using a Teflon-lined autoclave at 100 °C for 48 h, then the drying and calcination procedures required an additional time of 8 h at 600 °C. (12) Meanwhile, although the sol–gel method could synthesize the dispersed Cr catalyst under milder conditions, a long time and a large amount of the expensive surfactant and/or solvent as well as the environmentally hazardous acids and bases (hexadecyl triethylammonium bromide, polyethylene glycol hexadecyl ether, hydrochloric acid, ammonium hydroxide, and so on) limit the development of this method. (9,10) The impregnation method is broadly used to produce the Cr catalysts in industry and possesses the fast and simple characteristics that can resolve the above issue. However, Cr-based catalysts generated from this method generally are easily aggregated to form low-dispersed Cr(VI) or the crystalline Cr2O3, which largely decreases the DHP activity. For example, Kumar et al. reported that when the impregnation method was applied, the main Cr species in the catalyst was crystalline α-Cr2O3 even using SBA-15 with a high surface area and a large pore volume as the support. (6) Therefore, in general, the existed methods are difficult to promote the dispersion of Cr catalysts in a facile, controllable, and environmentally friendly manner.
As is known, all the above methods and other presented methods in the literature sustain the process of calcination, which leads to the serious aggregation of dispersed Cr6+ in the precursor solution into crystalline Cr2O3. This is also a big challenge in preparing highly dispersed Cr(VI) catalysts. Considering that the calcination of the dried sample under oxygen-deficit conditions in a muffle could lead to the generation of crystalline Cr2O3, we proposed the direct in situ thermal treatment of the dried sample in a quartz tube with flowing air to promote the dispersion of Cr catalysts. This method can effectively promote the sufficient contacting of the Cr species with the moving air and avoid the conventional calcination of the Cr species to form the aggregated Cr(VI) species and/or crystalline Cr2O3, which not only largely simplifies the synthesis procedure but also can synthesize the highly dispersed Cr(VI) precursors in a simple and controllable manner. More importantly, the catalytic performance of the synthesized catalyst is largely superior to those reported in the literature, even some noble metal catalysts. Furthermore, we also demonstrated the detailed type, including the oxidation state and the local structure, of the active Cr(VI) precursor over the prepared Cr-based catalysts via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy as well as other characterization techniques. The structure–performance relationships between the active Cr(VI) precursor and the DHP activity were established, and the results showed that monomeric Cr(VI) species was the precursor of active Cr(III) sites and had a linear correlation with the DHP activity.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
EO20PO70EO20, BASF (Pluronic P123) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), deionized water, ammonium chromate, and chromium trioxide, the purity level of NH3·H2O (25 % NH3) is analytical pure, all manufacturers were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Ltd., China.
MCM-41 was synthesized using microwave processing. First, CTAB was added into water, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 20 min. Then, NH3·H2O was added to the mixtures. After the stirring, TEOS was slowly dropped into the above solution. Then, the solution was heated with a microwave for 5 min. Afterward, the mixtures were cooled down to room temperature and then washed with deionized water several times. The washed samples were dried at 110 °C for 8 h and then calcined at 600 °C for 5 h.
SBA-15 was prepared according to our laboratory preparation method. (13,14) Briefly, a certain percentage of P123, H2O, and HCl were completely dissolved at 40 °C, TEOS was added dropwise and stirred at 40 °C for 24 h. Then, the formed gel was crystallized at 90 °C for 24 h. The washed sample was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h to remove the templates.
Cr supported on MCM-41 was prepared by the incipient impregnation process. CrO3 (where CrO42– was obtained by dropping NH3·H2O to adjust pH to 9.3) was selected as the precursor and the corresponding Cr loading was 10.0 wt %. The aqueous solutions of Cr were impregnated with a certain amount of silicon-based carriers. After stirring for 10 min, the resulting slurry was dried at 110 °C overnight. When using traditional calcination, the catalyst was calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The catalysts were denoted Cr/MCM-TC. Other conditions remain unchanged, H8CrN2O4 and Cr(NO3)3 were chosen as precursors, and SBA-15 was selected as the support. All the catalysts were denoted Cr/MCM-TC (H8CrN2O4), Cr/MCM-TC (Cr(NO3)3), Cr/SBA-TC (H8CrN2O4), Cr/SBA-TC (Cr(NO3)3), and Cr/SBA-TC (CrO42–).
Notably, to avoid the aggregation of the Cr species at high temperatures, we slightly modified the process of high-temperature calcination and proposed the direct in situ calcination of the dried sample using the flowing air in a reaction tube. The detailed process was given in the following. First, the dried Cr-based sample was sieved into a 40–60 mesh and placed in a fixed bed reactor (Φ20 × 200 mm). Then, the dried sample was heated under flowing air (30 mL/min) to 550 °C for 6 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The catalyst was denoted Cr/MCM-FC. Other conditions remain unchanged, H8CrN2O4 and Cr(NO3)3 were selected as precursors, and SBA-15 was selected as the support. All the catalysts were denoted Cr/MCM-FC (H8CrN2O4), Cr/MCM-FC (Cr(NO3)3), Cr/SBA-FC (H8CrN2O4), Cr/SBA-FC (Cr(NO3)3), and Cr/SBA-FC (CrO42–). The loading of the Cr species over the selected Cr/MCM-FC and Cr/MCM-TC samples is measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP) and shown in Table S1. The corresponding Cr loadings were found to be 7.74 and 8.04 wt % for Cr/MCM-FC and Cr/MCM-TC, respectively. Although the theoretical loading of the two samples is 10%, the volatilization of the Cr species during calcination is unavoidable, which decreases the loading of the Cr species to some degree.
2.2. Characterization
The surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter of the catalysts were obtained by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements at 77 K on a NOVA 4200 (Quantachrome, USA) instrument. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore-size distribution was obtained on the basis of the desorption branch of the isotherms by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were measured on a PANalytical X’pert PPR diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å, 40 kV and 30 mA). Data were collected in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The temperature programed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR). H2-TPR experiments were carried out on a homemade instrument in the lab. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst samples (ca. 100 mg) were pre-treated under a N2 flow at 500 °C for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature. The H2-TPR process was conducted from 40 to 850 °C using a 10% H2/Ar mixture (30 cm3 min–1) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The H2 signal was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the elemental composition of the catalysts and determine the chemical oxidation states of surface chromium species. XPS measurements were conducted on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe II spectrometer, equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα excitation. The correction of the charge effect was performed by taking the C 1s binding energy at 284.6 eV. Raman spectra were obtained using a high-resolution Raman spectrometry system (Renishaw inVia Raman imaging microscope, the excitation wavelength was 532 nm). The sample was pretreated under the desired temperature and gas flow using in situ cell with a quartz window. After pretreatment, the samples (0.1 g) were kept at room temperature for 1 h under the conditions of pure N2. Subsequently, the flowing gas was switched to the water-free air with a flow rate of 30 mL/min. Then, the samples were heated from 200 to 550 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C/min. At this process, the corresponding Raman signals were collected at the specific temperature. As for traditional Cr-MCM-TC, Raman spectra were conducted in the atmosphere of no flowing gas at the same temperature and time. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu2501PC using a Cary 500 spectrometer, with BaSO4 as the benchmark, and spectra were obtained from 200 to 1000 nm. UV–Raman measurements were performed on LabRaman’s HR-UV spectrometer. The spectrum was collected at a 325 nm wavelength and He–Cd light source. The X-ray absorption spectra were collected on the beamline BL01C1 in NSRRC. The radiation was monochromatized by a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. The ring energy and ring current were 2.5 GeV and 350–380 ma, respectively. The energy was calibrated using the Mn k edge absorption of Mn foil (6538.0 eV). The energy step in the XANES region was 0.3 eV. TEM and HR-TEM analyses were carried out using a JEO-2010 (JEOL) field-emission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV.
2.3. Catalytic Activity and Stability Tests
The catalytic performance of DHP was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor with the catalyst (ca. 400 mg) sieved between 40 and 60 mesh. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated at 600 °C for 0.5 h in a dry N2 (30 cm3 min–1). Subsequently, the reaction gas of C3H8 (5 mL/min) and N2 (30 mL/min) was introduced into the reactor, the DHP was conducted at 600 °C and atmospheric pressure. The reactants and products were analyzed online on a Fuli 9790 gas chromatograph (GC) combined with TCD and FID detectors. The following eqs 1 and 2 were used to calculate the conversion, selectivity, and yield of propylene:

where C3H8,in and C3H8,out are the molar contents of propane in the feed and exit flows respectively, and n is the number of moles of hydrocarbons. Because the formation of coke was instantaneous and time dependent, the conversion of propane into coke was not considered in the calculation results. The rate of propene formation was determined from the amount of propene formed at a degree of propane conversion below 10% (eq 3).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Catalytic Activity
Cr-based catalysts in this work were prepared by the flowing-air-induced transformation method. Compared to the traditional impregnation method, the biggest difference between them originates from the calcination manner. In the traditional one (Cr/MCM-41-TC), the dried Cr/MCM-41 was calcined in a muffle where the outside surface of the catalyst was fully exposed to air, while the inside of the catalyst was likely short of air. As for our simplified method (Cr/MCM-41-FC), the dried Cr/MCM-41 was in situ calcined in a quartz tube with flowing air, where the air could run through both the inside and outside of the catalyst, which effectively prevents the catalyst being in the status of oxygen-deficient and thus avoids aggregation.
To ensure if novel Cr/MCM-41-FC has the distinct advantage or not, we compared the catalytic performances of novel Cr/MCM-41-FC with the traditional Cr/MCM-41-TC. The conversion of C3H8 and the selectivity of C3H6 for Cr/MCM-41-FC and Cr/MCM-41-TC are shown in Figure 1A,B. As seen, the initial conversion of C3H8 over traditional Cr/MCM-41-TC is 20%, and the corresponding initial selectivity of C3H6 is 80%. When the flowing-air-induced transformation method was applied, the initial conversion of C3H8 over Cr/MCM-41-FC largely increases from 20 to 57%, followed by the slightly higher C3H6 selectivity. After the reaction of 30 h, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of traditional Cr/MCM-41-TC decrease to 10 and 0%, respectively, while the C3H8 conversion of Cr/MCM-41-FC declines to 30% and the C3H6 selectivity is maintained at 80%. Even after the reaction of 60 h, the C3H6 selectivity over Cr/MCM-41-FC is still kept at around 70%. The reason for the decreased selectivity of C3H6 over Cr/MCM-41-TC was clarified based on the distribution of products. As displayed in Figure S1, the constant decrease in the selectivity of C3H6 from 10 to 30 h is due to the production of additional byproducts, such as methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), and ethylene (C2H6). Therefore, there was large amount of CH4, C2H6, and C2H6 produced when the selectivity of C3H6 for traditional Cr/MCM-41-TC was below 20%. Meanwhile, the rate of propene formation and apparent activation energy (Ea) of propene formation for two catalysts are shown in Figure 1C,D. As seen, Cr/MCM-41-FC exhibited a higher reaction rate (1.5 vs 0.3 mmol–1C3H6gcat–1 min–1) and lower activation energy (250.3 vs 401.7 kJ/mol) compared with Cr/MCM-41-TC. Therefore, all the results indicate that Cr/MCM-41-FC prepared by the in situ synthesis method can not only improve the catalytic activity but also significantly promote the stability compared to traditional Cr/MCM-41-TC.

Moreover, we also compared the catalytic performance of our material with the non-noble metal and noble metal catalysts reported in the literature, as shown in Table 1. It is seen that all the reported catalysts exhibit either the high initial C3H6 selectivity (around 90%) followed by low C3H8 conversion (40–50%) or the low C3H6 selectivity (60–70%) with high C3H8 conversion (60–70%). In general, the high conversion and selectivity are difficult to achieve simultaneously. However, Cr/MCM-41-FC shows a distinct advantage compared to all the reported Cr-, V-, Ga-, and Pt-based catalysts, which show both high C3H8 conversion (around 90%) and high C3H6 selectivity (around 80%). Further investigation of the difference in the physicochemical properties of Cr/MCM-41-FC and Cr/MCM-41-TC might provide a better understanding of what kind of Cr species is an active precursor as well as the corresponding DHP mechanism.

3.2. Structural Characterization
First, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm is used to investigate if the surface area and pore size change after the sample was in situ calcined in a reactor tube with flowing air. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Cr/MCM-41-FC and Cr/MCM-41-TC are shown in Figure 2A. Compared to pure MCM-41, the isotherms of the two types of catalysts are largely changed, indicating that the addition of the Cr species alters the surface area and pore structure of MCM-41. (26,27) As shown in Table 2, it is found that Cr/MCM-41-TC shows the total BET surface area and average pore diameter of 623 m2/g and 3.4 nm, respectively. When the dried sample was in situ calcined, the surface area of Cr/MCM-41-FC slightly decreased to 562 m2/g and the average pore diameter instead increased to 3.7 nm. This result suggests that the surface structure of the Cr catalyst might have changed during the in situ synthesis process. The phase structure of the Cr species is characterized by XRD, and the result is displayed in Figure 2B. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.5, 33.74, 36.1, 41.6, 50.84, 54.9, 64.04, and 65.8° are the characteristics of the crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase. (28,29) It is found that Cr/MCM-FC shows a weaker diffraction intensity of α-Cr2O3 than that of Cr/MCM-TC, indicating that the flowing-air-induced transformation method could hinder the aggregation of the Cr species into α-Cr2O3. To further verify the above result, we reduce the Cr loading from 10 to 5 wt % and prepare the catalysts of 5Cr/MCM-TC and 5Cr/MCM-FC, and the corresponding XRD profiles are displayed in Figure S2. As seen, the diffraction peaks of α-Cr2O3 are distinctly observed for 5Cr/MCM-TC, while the corresponding diffraction peaks disappear over 5Cr/MCM-FC. Meanwhile, we also increased the Cr loading to 20 wt %, the results obtained are consistent with the catalyst with 10 wt % loading (Figure S3). These results demonstrate that the in situ synthesis of the dried sample can promote the formation of the highly dispersed Cr species. As we known that the main method for avoiding the aggregation of the Cr species is decreasing the loading of Cr because the high Cr loading in the catalysts easily leads to the aggregation of the Cr species. (30,31) However, when we chose a high loading of 10% and even 20 wt %, the diffraction intensity of α-Cr2O3 could still be significantly decreased, demonstrating that the flowing air treatment greatly promoted the dispersion of Cr/MCM41. Here, we provide a simple and effective method to promote the dispersion of the Cr species at both low and high loadings.

In order to further explore the change in the surface dispersion of the above catalysts, TEM and HRTEM are characterized, and the corresponding images and EDS element diagrams of Cr/MCM-FC and Cr/MCM-TC are shown in Figure 3A,B. As is shown, for traditional Cr/MCM-TC, the obvious black agglomerated particles were observed [Figure 3A(a)]. These particles show a clear lattice fringe of 0.167 nm in the high-resolution TEM image [Figure 3A(b)], corresponding to the (116) plane of rhombohedral Cr2O3. EDS element distribution diagrams [Figure 3A(c,d,e,f)] also prove the agglomeration of large Cr particles over the catalyst, indicating low dispersion. Surprisingly, as for Cr/MCM-FC, it can be clearly found that most of the Cr species are evenly distributed on the surface of MCM-41 in the low-resolution TEM image [Figure 3B(c,d,e,f)]. In the high-resolution TEM image [Figure 3B(b)], most of the Cr species was found to be present in the form of an amorphous structure or/and high dispersion, while a certain amount of Cr(III) was presented as crystalline Cr2O3 (Figure S4). Of course, according to the XRD result, there is some crystalline Cr2O3 present in Cr/MCM-FC. In fact, the formation of Cr2O3 is unavoidable during the synthesis of Cr(VI) due to the inherent nature of the Cr species with high activity and high redox. Especially when the high loading of the Cr species was used, the limited space and surface area for a specific support are presented.

According to the XRD and TEM results, we can find that the in situ synthesis method leads to the decrease in the amount of crystalline Cr2O3 and the increase in the Cr dispersion. We speculate that this might have originated from the conversion of Cr3+ into Cr6+ because the prepared Cr catalyst was completely contacted with air. XPS was used to determine the state valence of the Cr element over the traditional and modified catalysts. The Cr 2p XPS spectra of Cr/MCM-FC and Cr/MCM-TC are shown in Figure 4, and the corresponding component and content are listed in Table 3. According to the literature, the peak at around 579.5 eV is assigned to Cr(VI) (32) and the lower binding energy peak at about 576.9 eV is attributed to Cr(III) species. (33,34) It is found that the ratio value of Cr6+/Cr3+ is 0.3 for Cr/MCM-TC, suggesting that calcining the dried sample under oxygen-deficient conditions results in the unexpected conversion of Cr6+ into Cr3+. In the sample of Cr/MCM-FC, the ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ largely increases to 1.19, implying that calcining the dried sample in flowing air significantly stabilizes the valence state of the Cr species in the Cr6+. Furthermore, it is clear that the binding energy of Cr6+ shifts from 577.1 eV for Cr/MCM-TC to 576.6 eV for Cr/MCM-FC. The 0.7 eV shift of binding energy suggests the alteration of electronic and chemical environments of the Cr species when the in situ synthesis method was applied. (35−37) Notably, it is strange that, in addition to the change in the dispersion and the valence state of Cr species, the electronic and chemical environments of the Cr species largely changed only when the sample was in situ calcined in flowing air. Considering the limitation of the XPS technique in the determination of the electron state, XAFS spectra were used to precisely measure the valence state and the local coordination environment of the Cr species. The normalized Cr K-edge XANES spectra of standard Cr2O3, CrO3, as well as Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC are shown in Figure 5. As reported, the pre-edge region of photon energy below 6000 eV is attributed to the Cr6+ species, and the post-edge region of photon energy above 6000 eV is assigned to the Cr3+ species. (6,38) It is clear in Figure 5A that the peaks and edge position of Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC are located in between those of Cr2O3 and CrO3, suggesting the presence of a mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+ species. Among them, the spectrum of Cr/MCM-TC is closer to that of standard Cr2O3, and the spectrum of Cr/MCM-FC is much like that of standard CrO3. This result demonstrates that the traditional calcination easily leads to the formation of Cr2O3, while when the dried Cr/MCM-41 sample was in situ calcined in flowing air, the Cr6+ species is stabilized and dominated, which is in agreement with the XPS results. Fourier transforms of k2-weighted EXAFS spectra of standard Cr2O3, CrO3, as well as Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC are displayed in Figure 5B, and the details of EXAFS data analysis are given in the Table S2 of Supporting Information. According to the EXAFS spectra of standard Cr2O3 and CrO3, the peak at 1.1 Å is distinctly assigned to the Cr═O bond distance of Cr(VI) in a tetrahedral environment in CrO3, and the main peak at 1.50 Å is attributed to the Cr–O bond distance of Cr(III) in an octahedral environment in Cr2O3. (39,40) Thus, Cr/MCM-41-TC shows only the main presence of octahedral Cr3+ in Cr2O3 and Cr/MCM-41-FC shows the main existence of tetrahedral Cr6+ in CrO3. All the results are consistent with XPS analysis.

After determining the phase structure and valence state changes of the two catalysts, it is clear that the chromate ions mainly exist as Cr(VI) and a small amount of α-Cr2O3 after in situ synthesis, while the Cr(III) is mainly presented to form α-Cr2O3 when using the traditional calcination method. To explore the type of specific Cr(VI) species, ultraviolet diffuse reflection and Raman spectra of Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC are carried out and shown in Figure 6. The two spectra in Figure 6A show two main absorption bands at 270 and 365 nm. These bands are assigned to the O2––Cr6+ charge transfer transition of the chromate, (41) which indicates the presence of typical monochromate Cr(VI) (Cr═O)n on the catalyst surface. The characteristic peak of polychromate Cr(VI) (Cr–O–Cr)n appears at about 450 nm. (42) In addition, the peak around 600 nm are related to the existence of octahedral Cr(III), (43,44) classified as crystalline Cr2O3. In Cr/MCM-FC, it can be found that the absorption band of monomeric Cr(VI) is the strongest, and the bands corresponding to polymeric Cr(VI) and Cr2O3 are the weaker, while the traditional Cr/MCM-TC shows the opposite result. Furthermore, UV Raman spectra in Figure 6B are used to further explore the changes in the type of Cr species in these two catalysts. It was found that a strong and narrow peak appeared at around 980 nm, which was attributed to the dehydrated monochromate species. (6) The huge difference in the peak height between Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC indicates that there are more monomeric Cr(VI) produced during the in situ synthesis process, which is consistent with the results of UV–vis. Because Cr(III) is unreducible and Cr(VI) is easily reducible, the TPR experiment was further used to determine the type of Cr(VI) species depending on the reducibility. As shown in Figure 6C, the main reduction peaks were found at 280 and 380 °C for Cr/MCM-TC. It is reported in the literature that the reduction peaks appearing in the range of 250–450 °C correspond to the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). (45,46) Because polymeric Cr(VI) is more easily reduced than monomeric Cr(VI), (2) the reduction peak at lower temperatures is attributed to the easily reduced polymeric Cr(VI), while the reduced peak at higher temperatures is assigned to be the monomeric Cr(VI). (10) Notably, the reduction peak has largely altered after in situ calcining the material. It is clearly observed that the low-temperature peak is becoming smaller, and the high-temperature peak is instead becoming significantly bigger. This indicates that a large amount of the Cr(III) species in Cr2O3 as well as some polymeric Cr(VI) presented in Cr/MCM-TC are transformed into monomeric Cr(VI) after the in situ synthesis, which is in agreement with UV–vis and Raman results. Moreover, the shift of the peak position into the low-temperature region suggests the higher dispersion, which is in accordance with TEM results. According to the above characterization, it can be stated that the form of α-Cr2O3 and polymeric Cr(VI) is mainly presented in Cr/MCM-TC, while the form of monomeric Cr(VI) exists mostly in Cr/MCM-FC.

It is noted that all the above characterization of samples was measured under conditions of air exposure. Despite the fact that the microstructure of oxidized Cr-based samples are not possibly affected by air, we also perform the in situ Raman spectra under the real conditions to prove the above results. To further explain the reason why the in situ synthesis method can induce the generation of monomeric Cr(VI) rather than crystalline α-Cr2O3, the in situ Raman spectra of two catalysts under the temperature range from 200 to 550 °C are collected, and the results are shown in Figure 7. All the spectra of Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC at different temperatures mainly consist of two broad bands centered at 550 and 980 cm–1, which can be attributed to the symmetrical stretching of Cr–O–Cr in the Cr2O3 crystal and the symmetrical stretching of Cr═O in monomeric Cr(VI), respectively. (47,48) It is clearly found that when the temperature is located at 200 °C, both Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC have the same Raman spectra, showing the presence of exclusive monomeric Cr(VI) without the dehydration. This nondehydrated Cr(VI) species mainly originated from the Cr precursor salt (CrO42–) and then was well preserved after the sample was dried and calcined at 200 °C. When the temperature increases to 350 °C, there is no change in the peak intensity and position over Cr/MCM-TC (Figure 7A), while the intensity of the peak assigned to monomeric Cr(VI) over Cr/MCM-FC gradually increases (Figure 7B). This phenomenon suggests that when calcining the dried sample with enough air, the Cr species in the form of CrO42– are dehydrated into monomeric Cr(VI) in the form of CrO3, and the valence state of Cr(VI) can be maintained. Nevertheless, when the dried sample was calcined under oxygen-deficient conditions, the Cr species in the form of CrO42– did not change below 350 °C (Figure 7A). When the temperature keeps increasing to 350 °C, the Cr species in Cr/MCM-TC are gradually transformed into Cr2O3 (Figure 7A), while the dehydrated monomeric Cr(VI) in Cr/MCM-FC maintains the form of CrO3 (Figure 7B). Continuing the increase in the temperature, the intensity of Cr2O3 in Cr/MCM-TC enhances gradually, and no distinct change in the form of CrO3 is found for Cr/MCM-FC. The results clearly imply that when the dried sample was calcined at above 350 °C under oxygen-deficient conditions, Cr(VI) is inevitably converted into Cr(III), and then Cr(III) is aggregated and nucleated into Cr2O3. With the in situ synthesis of the dried sample in enough air, chromium ions can fully react with oxygen ions to form more active monomeric Cr(VI) without agglomerating. Although the mechanism that Cr(VI) can be converted into Cr(III) under oxygen-deficient conditions is unclear because no species has increased in valence, it is unquestionable that this valence-varied process indeed occurs. Obviously, this process is not in favor of forming monomeric Cr(VI) when the Cr sample was calcined.

3.3. Advantages of the In Situ Synthesis Method and Investigation of the Active Phase
This calcination-induced aggregation is a universal phenomenon present in heterogeneous catalysts and is also a big obstacle for preparing highly dispersed catalysts. (34,43,48,49) To obtain highly dispersed catalysts, a large number of literature reports focused on the immobilization of Cr species with hydroxyl on the support, (50,51) tuning the metal–support interaction, (52,53) as well as the modification of catalysts by the addition of other metals. (54−58) However, when the immobilization role of hydroxyl and the metal–support interactions, such as silicon hydroxyl and silicon dioxide, is weak, it is difficult to controllably synthesize the highly dispersed catalysts. (38,59,60) Thus, we apply the in situ synthesis method with flowing air to promote the dispersion of Cr-based catalysts and solve the big obstacle of aggregation when the samples were calcined at high temperatures. Meanwhile, the in situ synthesis method is controllable and is suited for even other catalyst samples with varied valence. We can control the flow rate of air (5 vs 15 mL/min in Figure S5) in the reactor tube to obtain different activities of Cr-based catalysts. Because the higher flow rate could lead to the extensive contacting of the Cr species with oxygen in air, the higher conversion of C3H8 and higher selectivity of C3H6 are obtained. There, the influence of space velocity on the catalytic activity caused by the internal and external diffusion can be excluded because increasing the space velocity would decrease the catalytic activity in the view of reaction kinetics. Of course, the catalytic activity would be limited to some degree when all the Cr species was fully contacted with air.
On the other hand, a large amount of literature reports considered that the unsaturated Cr(III) species is the active sites for the DHP reaction, and Cr(VI) is the precursor of active Cr(III). (7,34) Various kinds of Cr species, like oligomeric, polymeric, and isolated Cr(VI) species, are, respectively, proposed to be the precursors of active Cr(III). (41,43,61) However, the simple and controllable method to synthesize the above Cr(VI) species is lacking. (8,30,43,62,63) In our work, flowing-air-induced transformation method can orientedly synthesize the monomeric Cr(VI) species because monomeric Cr(VI) is easier to oxidize than polymeric Cr(VI). (2) To determine the precursor of active Cr(III), we also applied the same method to prepare the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts using different chromium salts [H8CrN2O4 and Cr(NO)3] as precursors. Surprisingly, the same phenomenon was obtained even when different chromium salts were used as precursors to prepare the Cr/MCM-41 catalyst (Figure S6). Moreover, SBA-15 was used as the support to prepare the Cr/SBA-15-FC catalysts. For comparison purposes, we present the catalytic data for all the studied samples in Table S3. The structure–performance relationship between the relative amount of monomeric Cr(VI) species (Table S4) in the above various catalysts (Figure S7) and DHP activity after reactions at 20, 80, and 140 min (Figures S8, S9) is established and shown in Figure 8. It is found that the conversion of C3H8 after reactions at 20, 80, and 100 min has a positive correlation with a relative amount of monomeric Cr(VI), demonstrating that the monomeric Cr(VI) species is the precursor of active Cr(III) in the DHP reaction. Furthermore, regarding the issue that a certain conversion is still obtained when monomeric Cr(VI) equals to 0 mmol/g, it has been reported in the relevant literature that polymeric Cr(VI) and even crystalline Cr2O3 exhibit a certain activity due to the strong redox properties of Cr species. (1,6) Therefore, when monomeric Cr(VI) is equal to 0 mmol/g, the small conversion of C3H8 can be achieved.

The amount of the active sites is calculated according to the peak area of H2-TPR profiles of Cr/MCM-41 and Cr/SBA-15.
3.4. Exploring the Stability and Deactivation Causes
As is known, Cr(VI) is characterized by high activity and high redox properties and can be rapidly reduced to Cr(III) under a reducing atmosphere. The high activity indicates the low stability; thus, the intrinsic nature of the Cr(VI) species leads to a continuous decrease in DHP activity for both Cr/MCM-TC and Cr/MCM-FC. It is observed at first glance that the FC sample is possibly less stable than the Cr/MCM-TC sample. However, the deactivation rate of Cr/MCM-FC is proved to be slower than that of the Cr/MCM-TC sample. It is clearly seen that the decrease of the C3H8 conversion of the Cr/MCM-FC sample from 57% at 0 h to the lowest value requires a time of 50 h, while the decrease of the C3H8 conversion of the Cr/MCM-TC sample from 20% at 0 h to the lowest value requires a time of 10 h. Thus, the deactivation rate of the Cr/MCM-FC sample is calculated to be 0.007, which is much lower than that of the Cr/MCM-TC sample (0.01). More importantly, the selectivity of the Cr/MCM-FC sample is much more stable than that of the Cr/MCM-TC sample. It is found that the selectivity of the Cr/MCM-FC sample is maintained from 80 to 65% for 60 h (Figure 1B), but the selectivity of C3H6 in the Cr/MCM-TC sample decreases to zero after 30 h. Distinctly, the selectivity of the Cr/MCM-FC sample was more stable compared to the Cr/MCM-TC sample. Therefore, we believe that the stability of the Cr/MCM-FC sample is better than that of the Cr/MCM-TC sample.
In order to investigate the relationship between catalyst performance and stability, TG, XPS, and XRD of Cr/MCM-FC and Cr/MCM-TC samples after the reaction of 3 and 30 h were characterized. First, the crystalline property and chemical valence of the Cr species over Cr/MCM-FC and Cr/MCM-TC samples after the reaction of 3 and 30 h were characterized by XRD and XPS. As shown in Figure S10, the diffraction intensity of crystalline α-Cr2O3 of Cr/MCM-TC was almost unchanged after the reaction of 3 h and 30 h. With no change in the crystalline phase of the Cr species, we investigated whether the valence state of Cr had changed before and after the reaction. The corresponding samples were characterized by XPS, and the results were shown in Figure S11. It is distinct that Cr/MCM-FC has more Cr(VI) on the surface of the catalyst after both 3 and 30 h of reaction compared to the sample Cr/MCM-TC. The change in the amount of the Cr(VI) species is in agreement with the variation in the catalytic activity.
More importantly, the amount and nature of coke over Cr/MCM-FC and Cr/MCM-TC are different and are characterized by TG. As shown in Figure S12, in terms of the amount of coke, the sample of Cr/MCM-TC (11 and 8%) produced more coke deposition than Cr/MCM-FC (0.9 and 0.5%) both after the reaction of 3 and 30 h. Then, for the property of the coke, it can be found that the coke produced by the Cr/MCM-FC samples can be oxidized at about 400 °C (soft coke), while the generated coke over Cr/MCM-TC can react at about 700 °C (hard coke). Distinctly, the produced coke was more stable for Cr/MCM-TC than that for Cr/MCM-FC, which easily deactivates the catalyst. It has been demonstrated in this work that Cr(VI) of the monomer is a precursor of active coordinatively unsaturated Cr sites in the DHP reaction, and hence, possessing more Cr(VI) in the form of the monomer was in favor of generating soft coke and exhibited better stability for the DHP reaction.
Overall, the in situ synthesis method we proposed might provide a facile, simple, and controllable strategy for this unsolved problem in the heterogeneous filed. The in situ synthesis in flowing air not only avoids the aggregation of the Cr species to controllably synthesize the active monomeric Cr(VI) species but also promotes the conversion of Cr3+ into Cr6+ and, more correctly, could maintain the six valence states of Cr in the Cr6+ precursor salts during the calcination process. Therefore, the activity and stability of Cr/MCM-41 were improved when the flowing-air-induced transformation method was used. Certainly, the flowing-air-induced transformation method we have introduced is still worth investigating in terms of the lifetime stability of the catalysts and the synthesis mechanism of the method. Moreover, it is easier to control the size of the reactor tube to realize the massive production of catalysts for the industrial application in the future, which exhibits the broad prospects for application.
4. Conclusions
In this work, the high-performance Cr/MCM-41 catalyst was prepared via a flowing-air-induced transformation method and tested for the DHP reaction. The activity result shows that this Cr/MCM-41 exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to the Cr-based catalyst prepared by the traditional calcination method and other reported Cr materials as well as some noble metal catalysts. The characterization of XAS and XPS suggests that the in situ synthesis of the dried Cr sample in flowing air can stabilize the valence state of Cr(VI) and avoid the quick conversion of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) species. TEM and XRD results show that the flowing-air-induced transformation method also prevents the conversion of Cr species into crystalline Cr2O3 and improves the dispersion of Cr species. Further evidence from UV–vis, TPR, and in situ Raman analyses demonstrates that our proposed method can controllably synthesize the form of monomeric Cr(VI) species, which is deemed to be the precursor of active coordinatively unsaturated Cr sites in the DHP reaction. This study provides a general strategy for preparing high-performance Cr-based catalysts as well as other metal oxide catalysts with varied valence, and we anticipate that this flowing-air-induced transformation method will show widespread application prospects in industry.
