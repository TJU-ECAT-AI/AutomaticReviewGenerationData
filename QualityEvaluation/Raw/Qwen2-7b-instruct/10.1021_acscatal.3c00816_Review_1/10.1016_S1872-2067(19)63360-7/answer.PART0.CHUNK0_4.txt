Answer: The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been analyzed. These materials are compared to traditional metal oxide supports based on their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The advantages and limitations of OMS catalysts are discussed, along with their reaction mechanisms. The influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is also considered.
