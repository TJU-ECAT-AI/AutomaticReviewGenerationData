Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported with VOx and CrOx, reveals distinct advantages over traditional metal oxide supports. These catalysts exhibit superior structural properties and catalytic behavior, attributed to their unique lattice oxygen species and enhanced activity through H2 pretreatment. This results in improved performance and extended operational lifetime compared to conventional catalysts.
