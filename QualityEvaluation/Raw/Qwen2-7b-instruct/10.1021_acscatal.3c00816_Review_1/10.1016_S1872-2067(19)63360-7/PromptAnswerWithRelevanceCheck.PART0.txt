Answer: The Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported with VOx and CrOx, demonstrated superior performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These catalysts showed enhanced stability and selectivity due to their unique structural properties, including pore size distribution and surface area, which significantly influenced their catalytic behavior. Lattice oxygen species were critical in the activation of propane and the promotion of dehydrogenation reactions. H2 pretreatment was found to improve the catalysts' activity and longevity by reducing coke formation. MCM-41 and SBA-15 provided robust support for the metal oxides, leading to efficient PDH processes. The OMS catalysts offered several advantages, such as higher yield of ethylene, lower energy consumption, and improved environmental sustainability. However, they faced limitations, including the risk of sintering at high temperatures and the requirement for precise control of synthesis parameters to maintain optimal structure.
