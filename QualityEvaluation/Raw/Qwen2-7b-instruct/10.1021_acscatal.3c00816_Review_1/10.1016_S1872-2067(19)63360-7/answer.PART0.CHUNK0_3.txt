Performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15, has been evaluated in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were contrasted with conventional metal oxide supports to elucidate their distinctive structural attributes and catalytic activity. The study also took into account the effects of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment on catalyst efficiency and deactivation during PDH reactions.
