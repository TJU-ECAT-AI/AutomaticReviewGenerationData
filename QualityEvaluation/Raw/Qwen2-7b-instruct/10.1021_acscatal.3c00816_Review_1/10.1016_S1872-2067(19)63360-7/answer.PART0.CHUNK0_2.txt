Metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been investigated for their performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.
Structural properties and catalytic behavior of these materials were compared to traditional metal oxide supports, highlighting advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms.
Lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment were discussed as influencing factors on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
