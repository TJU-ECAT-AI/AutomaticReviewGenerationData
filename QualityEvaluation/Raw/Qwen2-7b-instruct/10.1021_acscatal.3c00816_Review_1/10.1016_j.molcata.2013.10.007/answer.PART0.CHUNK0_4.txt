<p>The used support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst.</p>
<p>When the used support is mesoporous alumina, most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained.</p>
<p>The presence of this support promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support.</p>
<p>The oxidative state of Sn can be stabilized and the transformation of active sites is promoted, thus improving the catalytic stability and reaction selectivity.</p>
<p>Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction.</p>

The study highlights that the type of support significantly influences the structure and performance of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Mesoporous alumina support facilitates a more uniform dispersion of metallic particles, promotes spillover hydrogen, stabilizes the oxidation state of tin species, and enhances the transformation of active sites, thereby increasing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. In contrast, ZSM-5 introduces more cracking reactions due to its strong acid sites, while γ-Al2O3's porous nature can lead to coke accumulation. SBA-15, on the other hand, results in particle agglomeration and easier reduction of tin species, negatively impacting reaction efficiency.

研究强调了支撑类型对双金属Pt-Sn催化剂在丙烷裂解中的结构和性能的影响。微孔二氧化硅支持有助于金属粒子更均匀的分散，促进氢的溢出，稳定锡物种的氧化状态，并增强活性位点的转变，从而提高催化剂的稳定性与选择性。相比之下，ZSM-5引入了更多的裂解反应，由于其强酸性质，而γ-Al2O3的多孔性质可能导致焦炭积累。另一方面，使用SBA-15会导致粒子团聚并容易还原锡物种，这对反应效率产生不利影响。
