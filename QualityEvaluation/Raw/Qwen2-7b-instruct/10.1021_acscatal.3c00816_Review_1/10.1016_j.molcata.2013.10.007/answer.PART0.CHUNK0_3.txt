[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."
[2] "According to the results of XRD, textual properties and acid measurements for the as-prepared catalysts, the selected support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst."
[3] "In our experiments, when the used support is mesoporous alumina, most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained."
[4] "Furthermore, the presence of this support promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support."
[5] "As a result, the oxidative state of Sn can be stabilized and the transformation of active sites is promoted, thus improving the catalytic stability and reaction selectivity."
[6] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[7] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The study utilized techniques such as XRD, textural properties, and acid measurements to assess the influence of various supports on the catalyst's structure and reaction efficiency. The selected support significantly affects the catalyst's porosity and acidity characteristics. Among the tested supports, mesoporous alumina allowed for the most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles, promoting spillover hydrogen and enhancing the interaction between tin species and the support. This resulted in stabilization of tin's oxidation state and acceleration of active site transformation, leading to improved catalytic stability and selectivity. In contrast, ZSM-5's strong acid sites favored more cracking reactions, while the porous nature of γ-Al2O3 facilitated coke accumulation. Lastly, the use of SBA-15 led to metallic particle agglomeration and easier reduction of tin species, negatively impacting the reaction process.

在丙烷裂解（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，与传统金属氧化物支持进行了比较。研究使用了XRD、结构特性和酸测量等技术来评估不同支撑对催化剂结构和反应性能的影响。所选支撑是确定对应催化剂多孔性和酸性性质的主要因素。在测试的支撑材料中，多孔氧化铝允许获得最均匀和狭窄的金属颗粒分布，促进氢溢出并增强锡物种与支撑的相互作用。这导致锡的氧化状态稳定化和活性位点的加速转化，从而提高了催化稳定性与反应选择性。相反，ZSM-5的强酸位点更倾向于引发更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性则促进了焦炭积累。最后，使用SBA-15导致金属颗粒团聚，并使锡物种更容易还原，这对反应过程不利。
