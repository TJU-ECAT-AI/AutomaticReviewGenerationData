[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."
[2] "According to the results of XRD, textual properties and acid measurements for the as-prepared catalysts, the selected support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst."
[3] "When the used support is mesoporous alumina, most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained."
[4] "Furthermore, the presence of this support promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support."
[5] "As a result, the oxidative state of Sn can be stabilized and the transformation of active sites is promoted, thus improving the catalytic stability and reaction selectivity."
[6] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[7] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals distinct structural properties and catalytic behaviors compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

MCM-41 and SBA-15 offer unique advantages in terms of pore structure and acidity, affecting the catalytic activity and stability. The mesoporous nature of these supports enables a more uniform dispersion of metallic particles, facilitating the promotion of spillover hydrogen and enhancing the interaction between transition metals and the support. This stabilization of metal oxidation states and the promotion of active site transformations improve the overall stability and selectivity of the catalysts in PDH reactions.

However, the presence of strong acid sites in ZSM-5 leads to increased cracking reactions, while the porous character of γ-Al2O3 facilitates coke accumulation. The use of SBA-15, despite its potential for agglomerating metallic particles and causing easier reduction of tin species, can be detrimental to PDH reactions.

Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Oxygen availability on the support surface affects the catalytic efficiency, while hydrogen pretreatment can modulate the catalyst's activity and stability by altering the surface chemistry and promoting metal-oxygen interactions.

In conclusion, the choice of support material plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions. Factors such as porosity, acidity, and surface chemistry contribute to the unique catalytic behavior of these materials, offering both advantages and limitations compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

在分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能时，发现与传统金属氧化物支持相比，这些材料具有独特的结构特性和催化行为。

MCM-41和SBA-15在孔结构和酸性方面提供了独特优势，影响着催化剂的活性和稳定性。这些多孔支持物能够实现金属颗粒的均匀分散，促进过量氢的产生，并增强过渡金属与支持物之间的相互作用。这种金属氧化状态的稳定化和活性位点的促进改善了催化剂在PDH反应中的整体稳定性和选择性。

然而，ZSM-5中存在的强酸位点导致裂解反应增加，而γ-Al2O3的多孔性质则促进了焦炭积累。尽管SBA-15可能通过聚集金属颗粒和使锡物种更容易还原对反应不利，但它提供了独特的孔结构特性。

氧的存在状态和支持表面上的氧对催化剂的性能和失活有显著影响。氧气可用性影响催化效率，而氢气预处理可以通过改变表面化学和促进金属-氧相互作用来调节催化剂的活性和稳定性。

综上所述，支持材料的选择在确定OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的有效性中起着关键作用。孔隙率、酸性和表面化学是这些材料独特催化行为的决定因素，与传统金属氧化物支持相比，它们既提供优势也存在局限性。
