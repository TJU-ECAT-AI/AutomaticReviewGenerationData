The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was analyzed. The structural properties and catalytic behavior were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The study found that the selection of the support significantly affects the porous character and acidic properties of the catalysts. 

When mesoporous alumina was used, it facilitated a more uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles, which in turn promoted spillover hydrogen and strengthened the interaction between tin species and the support. This stabilization of the oxidative state of tin and promotion of active site transformation led to enhanced catalytic stability and selectivity in PDH reactions.

In contrast, the strong acid sites present in ZSM-5 induced more cracking reactions, while the porous nature of γ-Al2O3 increased the accumulation of coke. The use of SBA-15 as a support resulted in the agglomeration of metallic particles and an easier reduction of tin species, which negatively impacted reaction performance.

Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment were also found to influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species can contribute to the stabilization of metal oxides and enhance their catalytic activity, whereas H2 pretreatment can help reduce the formation of coke and improve the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷裂解（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。与传统金属氧化物支撑相比，结构特性和催化行为进行了比较。研究发现，选择支撑是决定相应催化剂的多孔特性和酸性性质的主要因素。

当使用介孔氧化铝时，可以实现更均匀和窄分布的金属颗粒，这反过来促进了溢流氢的产生并加强了锡物种与支撑之间的相互作用。这种锡物种氧化状态的稳定化和活性位点的促进，从而提高了PDH反应过程中的催化稳定性和选择性。

相比之下，ZSM-5中存在的强酸位点会引发更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性会增加焦炭的积累。使用SBA-15作为支撑会导致金属颗粒聚集，并且容易还原锡物种，这对反应过程不利。

诸如晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素也被发现会影响催化剂性能和PDH反应过程中的失活。晶格氧物种可以有助于稳定金属氧化物并增强其催化活性，而H2预处理可以帮助减少焦炭的形成并提高PDH过程的整体效率。

The comparative study in the document focuses on the preparation and evaluation of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on various supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for propane dehydrogenation. The results indicate that the selected support significantly influences the porous structure and acidity of the catalysts. Specifically, mesoporous alumina supports lead to the formation of more uniform and narrow distributions of metallic particles, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of spillover hydrogen and improved interaction between Sn species and the support are attributed to the mesoporous alumina, stabilizing the oxidation state of tin and promoting active site transformation. In contrast, ZSM-5's strong acid sites promote more cracking reactions, while the porous nature of γ-Al2O3 facilitates coke accumulation. The use of SBA-15 results in the aggregation of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which negatively impacts the reaction.

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals distinct structural properties and catalytic behaviors compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

MCM-41 and SBA-15 offer unique advantages in terms of pore structure and acidity, affecting the catalytic activity and stability. The mesoporous nature of these supports enables a more uniform dispersion of metallic particles, facilitating the promotion of spillover hydrogen and enhancing the interaction between transition metals and the support. This stabilization of metal oxidation states and the promotion of active site transformations improve the overall stability and selectivity of the catalysts in PDH reactions.

However, the presence of strong acid sites in ZSM-5 leads to increased cracking reactions, while the porous character of γ-Al2O3 facilitates coke accumulation. The use of SBA-15, despite its potential for agglomerating metallic particles and causing easier reduction of tin species, can be detrimental to PDH reactions.

Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Oxygen availability on the support surface affects the catalytic efficiency, while hydrogen pretreatment can modulate the catalyst's activity and stability by altering the surface chemistry and promoting metal-oxygen interactions.

In conclusion, the choice of support material plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions. Factors such as porosity, acidity, and surface chemistry contribute to the unique catalytic behavior of these materials, offering both advantages and limitations compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

在分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能时，发现与传统金属氧化物支持相比，这些材料具有独特的结构特性和催化行为。

MCM-41和SBA-15在孔结构和酸性方面提供了独特优势，影响着催化剂的活性和稳定性。这些多孔支持物能够实现金属颗粒的均匀分散，促进过量氢的产生，并增强过渡金属与支持物之间的相互作用。这种金属氧化状态的稳定化和活性位点的促进改善了催化剂在PDH反应中的整体稳定性和选择性。

然而，ZSM-5中存在的强酸位点导致裂解反应增加，而γ-Al2O3的多孔性质则促进了焦炭积累。尽管SBA-15可能通过聚集金属颗粒和使锡物种更容易还原对反应不利，但它提供了独特的孔结构特性。

氧的存在状态和支持表面上的氧对催化剂的性能和失活有显著影响。氧气可用性影响催化效率，而氢气预处理可以通过改变表面化学和促进金属-氧相互作用来调节催化剂的活性和稳定性。

综上所述，支持材料的选择在确定OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的有效性中起着关键作用。孔隙率、酸性和表面化学是这些材料独特催化行为的决定因素，与传统金属氧化物支持相比，它们既提供优势也存在局限性。

The study highlights that the type of support significantly influences the structure and performance of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Mesoporous alumina support facilitates a more uniform dispersion of metallic particles, promotes spillover hydrogen, stabilizes the oxidation state of tin species, and enhances the transformation of active sites, thereby increasing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. In contrast, ZSM-5 introduces more cracking reactions due to its strong acid sites, while γ-Al2O3's porous nature can lead to coke accumulation. SBA-15, on the other hand, results in particle agglomeration and easier reduction of tin species, negatively impacting reaction efficiency.
