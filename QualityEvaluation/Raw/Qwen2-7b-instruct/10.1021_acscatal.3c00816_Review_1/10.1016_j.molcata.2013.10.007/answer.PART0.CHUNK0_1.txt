[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."
[2] "According to the results of XRD, textual properties and acid measurements for the as-prepared catalysts, the selected support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst."
[3] "When the used support is mesoporous alumina, most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained."
[4] "The presence of this support promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support."
[5] "As a result, the oxidative state of Sn can be stabilized and the transformation of active sites is promoted, thus improving the catalytic stability and reaction selectivity."
[6] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[7] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The comparative study in the document focuses on the preparation and evaluation of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on various supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) for propane dehydrogenation. The results indicate that the selected support significantly influences the porous structure and acidity of the catalysts. Specifically, mesoporous alumina supports lead to the formation of more uniform and narrow distributions of metallic particles, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. The presence of spillover hydrogen and improved interaction between Sn species and the support are attributed to the mesoporous alumina, stabilizing the oxidation state of tin and promoting active site transformation. In contrast, ZSM-5's strong acid sites promote more cracking reactions, while the porous nature of γ-Al2O3 facilitates coke accumulation. The use of SBA-15 results in the aggregation of metallic particles and easy reduction of tin species, which negatively impacts the reaction.

文献中的比较研究集中在对不同支撑（ZSM-5、γ-Al2O3、微孔二氧化硅、SBA-15）上制备的双金属PtSn催化剂的制备和评估，用于丙烷脱氢。结果表明，所选支撑体是决定相应催化剂的多孔特性和酸性性质的主要因素。具体而言，微孔二氧化硅支持可以导致金属粒子更加均匀和狭窄的分布，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。微孔二氧化硅的存在促进了过量氢的产生，并加强了锡物种与支撑物之间的相互作用，稳定了锡的氧化状态并促进了活性位点的转变，从而提高了催化剂的催化稳定性和反应选择性。相反，ZSM-5的强酸性位点促进更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性则增加了焦炭的积累。使用SBA-15导致金属颗粒聚集和锡物种的容易还原，这对反应不利。
