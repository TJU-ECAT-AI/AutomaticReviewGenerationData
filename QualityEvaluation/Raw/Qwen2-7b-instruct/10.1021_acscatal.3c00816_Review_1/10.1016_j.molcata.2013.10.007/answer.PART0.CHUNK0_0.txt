[1] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on different supports (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15) were prepared and several techniques were employed to study the influence of different supports on the catalytic structure and reaction performances."
[2] "The selected support is the main factor to determine the porous character and the acidic properties of the corresponding catalyst."
[3] "When the used support is mesoporous alumina, most uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles can be obtained."
[4] "The presence of this support promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support."
[5] "Compared with this, the existence of the strong acid sites in ZSM-5 induces more cracking reaction and the porous character of γ-Al2O3 increases the accumulation of the coke."
[6] "Meanwhile, the use of SBA-15 support leads to the agglomeration of metallic particles and the easy reduction of tin species, which is disadvantageous to the reaction."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was analyzed. The structural properties and catalytic behavior were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The study found that the selection of the support significantly affects the porous character and acidic properties of the catalysts. 

When mesoporous alumina was used, it facilitated a more uniform and narrow distribution of metallic particles, which in turn promoted spillover hydrogen and strengthened the interaction between tin species and the support. This stabilization of the oxidative state of tin and promotion of active site transformation led to enhanced catalytic stability and selectivity in PDH reactions.

In contrast, the strong acid sites present in ZSM-5 induced more cracking reactions, while the porous nature of γ-Al2O3 increased the accumulation of coke. The use of SBA-15 as a support resulted in the agglomeration of metallic particles and an easier reduction of tin species, which negatively impacted reaction performance.

Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment were also found to influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species can contribute to the stabilization of metal oxides and enhance their catalytic activity, whereas H2 pretreatment can help reduce the formation of coke and improve the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷裂解（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。与传统金属氧化物支撑相比，结构特性和催化行为进行了比较。研究发现，选择支撑是决定相应催化剂的多孔特性和酸性性质的主要因素。

当使用介孔氧化铝时，可以实现更均匀和窄分布的金属颗粒，这反过来促进了溢流氢的产生并加强了锡物种与支撑之间的相互作用。这种锡物种氧化状态的稳定化和活性位点的促进，从而提高了PDH反应过程中的催化稳定性和选择性。

相比之下，ZSM-5中存在的强酸位点会引发更多的裂解反应，而γ-Al2O3的多孔特性会增加焦炭的积累。使用SBA-15作为支撑会导致金属颗粒聚集，并且容易还原锡物种，这对反应过程不利。

诸如晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素也被发现会影响催化剂性能和PDH反应过程中的失活。晶格氧物种可以有助于稳定金属氧化物并增强其催化活性，而H2预处理可以帮助减少焦炭的形成并提高PDH过程的整体效率。
