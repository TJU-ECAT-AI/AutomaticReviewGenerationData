1. The research focuses on the use of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These OMS catalysts, supported with VOx and CrOx, demonstrate higher activity and stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports in PDH.
   
2. The structural properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15 significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the catalysts. The lattice oxygen species are essential for the activation of propane molecules during the dehydrogenation process.

3. H2 pretreatment enhances the performance of the catalyst by strengthening the interaction between the active sites and the reactants. However, excessive H2 pretreatment might lead to catalyst deactivation due to the sintering of active sites.

1. 研究集中在金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。这些由VOx和CrOx支持的OMS催化剂，在与传统金属氧化物支持相比时，表现出更高的活性和稳定性。

2. MCM-41和SBA-15的结构特性对催化剂的行为有显著影响。晶格氧物种对于激活丙烷分子并在脱氢过程中起关键作用。

3. 预处理氢气可以提高催化剂的性能，通过增强活性位点与反应物之间的相互作用。然而，过度预处理氢气可能会导致催化剂失活，由于活性位点的聚集。
