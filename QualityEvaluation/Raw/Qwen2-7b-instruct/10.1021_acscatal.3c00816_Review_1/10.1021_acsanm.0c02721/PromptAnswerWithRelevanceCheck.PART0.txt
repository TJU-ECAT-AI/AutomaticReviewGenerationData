Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, were used to support VOx and CrOx in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials were synthesized via the coprecipitation method followed by calcination. The MS-CoO NCs had a high surface area (BET surface area = 768 m²/g) and a narrow size distribution with an average diameter of around 10 nm. The enhanced activity of the MS-CoO NCs compared to commercial CoO powders can be attributed to the high surface area and the well-defined mesoporous structure. This structure provides an effective surface for the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. Moreover, H2 pretreatment improved the stability of the MS-CoO NCs during PDH reactions, preventing the sintering of cobalt nanoparticles and maintaining their catalytic activity.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15，用于支持VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中。这些材料通过共沉淀方法随后热处理合成。MS-CoO NCs具有高比表面积（BET比表面积=768 m²/g）和直径约为10nm的窄尺寸分布。MS-CoO NCs的增强活性与商业CoO粉末相比，可以归因于其高比表面积和定义明确的介孔结构。这种结构为吸附和脱附反应物和产物提供了有效的表面。此外，H2预处理改善了MS-CoO NCs在PDH反应过程中的稳定性，防止了钴纳米颗粒的聚集并维持了其催化活性。

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, exhibit outstanding performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts surpass traditional metal oxide supports in terms of both stability and activity. The lattice oxygen species are pivotal in the activation process of propane molecules on the catalyst surface. Prior treatment with hydrogen gas increases the catalyst's reactivity by boosting the lattice oxygen concentration. Nonetheless, prolonged exposure to high temperatures results in catalyst deactivation due to sintering and the loss of surface functionality.
