[3] "In this work, we report on the synthesis of mesoporous silica-supported cobalt(II) oxide nanoclusters (MS-CoO NCs) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[4] "The MS-CoO NCs were prepared by the coprecipitation method followed by calcination."
[5] "The as-prepared MS-CoO NCs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis."
[6] "The results showed that the MS-CoO NCs had a high surface area (BET surface area = 768 m²/g) and a narrow size distribution with an average diameter of around 10 nm."
[7] "The MS-CoO NCs were then evaluated for their activity in PDH reactions."
[8] "The results demonstrated that the MS-CoO NCs exhibited significantly higher activity compared to commercial CoO powders."
[9] "The enhanced activity can be attributed to the high surface area and the well-defined mesoporous structure of the MS-CoO NCs, which provide an effective surface for the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products."
[10] "Furthermore, the stability of the MS-CoO NCs was also investigated under various conditions, including H2 pretreatment."
[11] "The results indicated that the H2 pretreatment improved the stability of the MS-CoO NCs during the PDH reaction, preventing the sintering of cobalt nanoparticles and maintaining their catalytic activity."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, were used to support VOx and CrOx in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials were synthesized via the coprecipitation method followed by calcination. The MS-CoO NCs had a high surface area (BET surface area = 768 m²/g) and a narrow size distribution with an average diameter of around 10 nm. The enhanced activity of the MS-CoO NCs compared to commercial CoO powders can be attributed to the high surface area and the well-defined mesoporous structure. This structure provides an effective surface for the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. Moreover, H2 pretreatment improved the stability of the MS-CoO NCs during PDH reactions, preventing the sintering of cobalt nanoparticles and maintaining their catalytic activity.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15，用于支持VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中。这些材料通过共沉淀方法随后热处理合成。MS-CoO NCs具有高比表面积（BET比表面积=768 m²/g）和直径约为10nm的窄尺寸分布。MS-CoO NCs的增强活性与商业CoO粉末相比，可以归因于其高比表面积和定义明确的介孔结构。这种结构为吸附和脱附反应物和产物提供了有效的表面。此外，H2预处理改善了MS-CoO NCs在PDH反应过程中的稳定性，防止了钴纳米颗粒的聚集并维持了其催化活性。
