Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, exhibit outstanding performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts surpass traditional metal oxide supports in terms of both stability and activity. The lattice oxygen species are pivotal in the activation process of propane molecules on the catalyst surface. Prior treatment with hydrogen gas increases the catalyst's reactivity by boosting the lattice oxygen concentration. Nonetheless, prolonged exposure to high temperatures results in catalyst deactivation due to sintering and the loss of surface functionality.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出卓越的性能。这些催化剂在稳定性和活性方面均超越了传统的金属氧化物支持材料。晶格氧物种对于催化表面丙烷分子的活化起着至关重要的作用。在催化剂表面进行氢气预处理可以增加活性氧浓度，从而增强催化剂的反应性。然而，长时间在高温下使用会导致催化剂失活，原因在于颗粒聚集和表面功能性的丧失。
