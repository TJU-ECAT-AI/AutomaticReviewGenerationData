<p>Highlights • Effect of hydrogen pre-reduction on Co@MCM41-catalyzed propane dehydrogenation was studied. • Multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species occurs in the pre-reduction. • Small-size Co0 cluster with moderate Co-silica interaction shows optimal catalytic performance. • Framework Co2+ ion with strong interaction with silica support shows low intrinsic activity. • Large Co particle with weak Co-silica interaction shows low propylene selectivity and severe coke issue.</p>
<p>Abstract Co@MCM41 catalysts with and without hydrogen prereduction treatments are prepared for catalyzing nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene. Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction. The location and chemical states of Co species in catalysts are related to the prereduction temperature and time duration. The catalysts reduced at 650700 C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst. A higher prereduction temperature of 750800 C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition. Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption and coke formation for the Cocatalyzed PDH reactions.</p>

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key points. The study focuses on the impact of hydrogen pre-reduction on the catalytic activity of cobalt-based catalysts. It highlights the multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ ions into extra-framework Co0 species during the pre-reduction process. The location and chemical state of cobalt species within the catalysts depend on the pre-reduction temperature and duration. Catalysts treated at 650-700°C consist of a combination of framework Co2+ ions and small Co0 nanoclusters confined within the MCM41 channels. These catalysts exhibit 23 times higher reaction rates in selective PDH reactions compared to unreduced catalysts. Increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 750-800°C leads to the formation of larger cobalt particles, resulting in significantly reduced reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. Hydrogen pre-reduction adjusts the interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, influencing the catalyst's ability to activate propane, desorb propylene, and prevent coke formation in PDH reactions.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，揭示了一些关键点。研究重点关注氢预还原对含钴催化剂活性的影响。它强调了框架Co2+离子在预还原过程中的多阶段迁移至额外框架Co0物种。钴物种在催化剂中的位置和化学状态取决于预还原温度和持续时间。在650-700°C处理的催化剂由框架Co2+离子和被限制在MCM41通道内的小型Co0纳米簇组成。这些催化剂在选择性PDH反应中的反应速率比未处理的催化剂高出23倍。将预还原温度提高到750-800°C导致形成较大的钴颗粒，导致显著降低的反应速率、丙烯选择性和严重的结焦沉积。氢预还原调整了钴物种与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用，影响催化剂激活丙烷、脱除丙烯以及防止PDH反应中焦炭形成的能力。
