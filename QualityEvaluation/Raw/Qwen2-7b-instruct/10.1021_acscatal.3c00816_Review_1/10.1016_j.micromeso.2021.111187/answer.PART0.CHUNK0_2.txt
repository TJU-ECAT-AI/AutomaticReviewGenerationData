The study analyzed the impact of hydrogen pre-reduction on the performance of cobalt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, specifically focusing on cobalt-supported MCM-41. It was found that during pre-reduction, the framework cobalt ions (Co2+) migrate through multiple stages to form extraframework cobalt zero-valent species (Co0). This process leads to the creation of a unique structure where both Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 clusters are confined within the MCM-41 channels. Compared to unreduced catalysts, these pre-reduced catalysts exhibited a remarkable increase in reactivity, approximately 23 times higher, in selective propane dehydrogenation reactions to produce propylene. 

However, increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 750-800°C resulted in the formation of larger cobalt particles. This change led to a significant decrease in reaction rates and propylene selectivity, alongside severe coke formation. The study also revealed that hydrogen pre-reduction alters the interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, influencing the catalyst's ability to activate propane, desorb propylene, and prevent coke formation in the catalyzed propane dehydrogenation reactions.

研究分析了氢预还原对丙烷脱氢钴催化剂性能的影响，特别是针对支持在MCM-41上的钴。发现，在预还原过程中，框架钴离子（Co2+）通过多个阶段迁移形成额外框架零价钴物种（Co0）。这一过程导致了独特的结构产生，其中既包含框架Co2+离子，又包含被限制在MCM-41通道内的小型Co0簇。与未预处理的催化剂相比，这些预处理过的催化剂在选择性丙烷脱氢反应中生成丙烯的反应速率提高了约23倍。

然而，将预处理温度提高到750-800°C会导致形成更大的钴颗粒。这种变化导致了反应速率和丙烯选择性显著下降，以及严重的焦炭沉积。研究还表明，氢预处理调节了钴物种与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用，影响了催化剂激活丙烷、丙烯脱附和防止焦炭形成的能力，在催化丙烷脱氢反应中。
