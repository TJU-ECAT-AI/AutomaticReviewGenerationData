Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, reveals significant differences compared to traditional metal oxide supports. MCM-41 and SBA-15 offer unique structural properties, enabling more efficient activation of propane molecules due to their ordered mesoporous architecture. This structure allows for optimized diffusion pathways, enhancing the rate of PDH reactions.

In terms of catalytic behavior, the interaction between the metal species (Co, VOx, CrOx) and the silica support plays a crucial role. Prereduction processes, especially at temperatures ranging from 650 to 700°C, facilitate the migration of framework Co2+ ions into extraframework Co0 species. This transformation results in the formation of small-size Co0 clusters within the MCM-41 channels, which exhibit superior catalytic performance. These clusters show an optimal balance between the strength of Co-silica interaction and the size of the Co particles, leading to enhanced reaction rates and propylene selectivity.

On the other hand, higher prereduction temperatures, specifically 750 to 800°C, lead to the formation of larger Co particles. While these particles might have a certain degree of interaction with the silica support, they result in significantly decreased reaction rates and propylene selectivity, alongside severe coke deposition issues. This demonstrates that the size and distribution of Co particles, influenced by the prereduction process, are critical factors affecting the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions.

Moreover, the interaction between the metal species and the silica support is finely tuned through the prereduction step. This interaction directly impacts the efficiency of propane activation, propylene desorption, and the overall coke formation during the PDH process. By controlling the prereduction parameters, one can optimize the catalyst's performance, balancing the trade-offs between reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and coke formation.

In summary, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15, offer distinct advantages over traditional metal oxide supports in Propane Dehydrogenation reactions. The unique structural properties, optimized through prereduction processes, enable efficient propane activation, high propylene selectivity, and controlled coke formation, contributing to enhanced catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，与传统金属氧化物支持相比，显示出显著差异。MCM-41和SBA-15提供独特的结构特性，由于其有序的介孔结构，可以更有效地激活丙烷分子。这种结构允许优化扩散途径，提高PDH反应速率。

在催化行为方面，金属物种（Co、VOx、CrOx）与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用起着关键作用。通过预还原过程，特别是在650至700°C的温度范围内，可以实现框架Co2+离子向额外框架Co0物种的多阶段迁移。这一转变导致在MCM-41通道内形成小尺寸的Co0簇，这些簇表现出优越的催化性能。这些簇显示了Co-silica相互作用强度与Co粒子大小之间的理想平衡，从而提高了反应速率和丙烯选择性。

另一方面，更高的预还原温度，具体为750至800°C，会导致较大Co粒子的形成。尽管这些粒子可能在一定程度上与二氧化硅支持相互作用，但它们会导致反应速率和丙烯选择性显著下降，以及严重的焦炭沉积问题。这表明Co粒子的大小和分布，受到预还原过程的影响，是影响催化剂性能的关键因素，在PDH过程中。

此外，金属物种与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用通过预还原步骤进行精细调节。这种相互作用直接影响丙烷激活、丙烯脱附以及整体焦炭形成过程的效率。通过控制预还原参数，可以优化催化剂性能，平衡反应速率、丙烯选择性和焦炭形成之间的权衡。

总之，金属有序介孔硅催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15，在丙烷脱氢反应中提供了独特的优势。通过预还原过程的独特结构特性，可以实现高效的丙烷激活、高丙烯选择性和可控焦炭形成，从而增强PDH反应的催化性能。
