The study investigated the impact of hydrogen pre-reduction on cobalt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It was found that during pre-reduction, framework cobalt(II) ions migrate into extraframework cobalt(0) species in multiple stages. The location and chemical states of cobalt species within the catalysts depend on the pre-reduction temperature and duration. Catalysts treated at temperatures between 650 and 700 degrees Celsius consist of both framework cobalt(II) ions and small cobalt(0) nanoclusters confined within the MCM41 channels. These catalysts exhibit a 23 times higher reaction rate in selective propane dehydrogenation compared to non-pre-reduced catalysts. Increasing the pre-reduction temperature to 750 to 800 degrees Celsius results in the formation of larger cobalt particles, which leads to a significant decline in reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. The hydrogen pre-reduction process adjusts the interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, influencing the performance of propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation in the cobalt-catalyzed propane dehydrogenation reactions.

研究了氢预还原对MCM41负载钴催化剂催化丙烷脱氢的影响。发现，在预还原过程中，框架钴(II)离子通过多个阶段迁移到额外框架钴(0)物种中。催化剂中钴物种的位置和化学状态取决于预还原温度和持续时间。在650到700摄氏度之间处理的催化剂由框架钴(II)离子和MCM41通道内受限的小尺寸钴(0)纳米簇组成。这些催化剂在选择性丙烷脱氢反应中的反应速率比非预还原催化剂高23倍。将预还原温度提高到750至800摄氏度会导致形成较大的钴颗粒，这导致反应速率、丙烯选择性和严重的焦炭沉积显著下降。氢预还原过程调整了钴物种与二氧化硅支持物之间的相互作用，影响了丙烷激活、丙烯脱附和焦炭形成在钴催化丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。
