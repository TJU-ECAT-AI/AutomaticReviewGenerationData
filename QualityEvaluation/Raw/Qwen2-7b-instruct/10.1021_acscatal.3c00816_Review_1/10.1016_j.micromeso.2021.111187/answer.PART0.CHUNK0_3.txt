The study investigates the effect of hydrogen pre-reduction on the performance of Co@MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It reveals that multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ ions leads to the formation of extra-framework Co0 species during the pre-reduction process. The location and chemical states of Co species in the catalysts are influenced by the pre-reduction temperature and duration. Catalysts treated at 650-700°C exhibit both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 clusters within the MCM41 channels, which results in a 23-fold increase in the selective PDH reaction rates compared to unreduced catalysts. Higher pre-reduction temperatures, around 750-800°C, lead to the formation of larger Co particles, causing a significant decrease in reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. The study demonstrates that hydrogen pre-reduction modifies the interaction between Co species and silica support, affecting the propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation processes in Co-catalyzed PDH reactions.

研究探讨了氢预还原对Co@MCM-41催化剂丙烷脱氢(PDH)性能的影响。发现框架Co2+离子在预还原过程中经历多阶段迁移，形成额外的Co0物种。催化剂中Co物种的位置和化学状态受预还原温度和持续时间的影响。在650-700°C处理的催化剂包含框架Co2+离子和MCM41通道内的小型Co0簇，这导致选择性PDH反应速率相比未处理催化剂提高了23倍。更高的预还原温度，大约为750-800°C，导致形成较大的Co颗粒，引起反应速率、丙烯选择性和严重结焦显著下降。研究表明，氢预还原调整了Co物种与二氧化硅支持物之间的相互作用，影响了Co催化PDH反应中的丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和结焦过程。
