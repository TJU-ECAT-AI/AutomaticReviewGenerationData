[1] "As a result, all the samples exhibit a similar trend as a function of time in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[2] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[3] "From Figure2B, UV bands at about 270 and 360nm express OCr(VI) charge transfer transitions of chromates species."
[4] "Moreover, an additional reduction band centered at about 280C appears clearly from the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample, which is given account for the reduction of Cr(VI) species dispersed on crystalline α-Cr2O3."
[5] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species. Instead, some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[6] "Actually, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained. But high Cr loadings are expected to cause the formation less active polymeric Cr(III) species."
[7] "However, as far as we know, few reports are focused on investigating the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species and their effects on the catalytic activity of PDH reaction. Thus, our current work is mainly to study the isolated Cr(VI) species in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts and analyzing its effect on catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane, which deserves significant importance for Cr-based PDH catalyst system."

1. The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions showed a similar trend in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity over time. Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 achieved the highest catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1 hour of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 had the poorest performance.

2. The UV bands at about 270 and 360 nm indicated OCr(VI) charge transfer transitions of chromates species. The intense peak centered at about 360 nm, characteristic for isolated Cr(VI) oxide, was more pronounced in the 15Cr/MCM-41 catalyst, suggesting more isolated Cr(VI) species were present in the sample with higher Cr content.

3. An additional reduction band at about 280°C appeared in the H2-TPR profile of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample. This was attributed to the reduction of Cr(VI) species dispersed on crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. At high Cr loadings, some inactive Cr(VI) species, referred to as isolated Cr(VI) species, were observed on the 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst. These isolated Cr(VI) species were found to be difficult to reduce and negatively impacted the catalytic activity for PDH process.

5. The general knowledge regarding Cr loadings in catalysts is that low loadings promote good dispersion of Cr species, leading to mononuclear Cr(VI) and some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies. High loadings are expected to form less active polymeric Cr(III) species.

6. Few studies have focused on the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species and their effects on PDH catalytic activity. The current work aimed to investigate the isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts and analyze their impact on the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation, which is crucial for Cr-based PDH catalyst systems.

1. 金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能显示出了随时间变化的相似趋势。在1小时反应后，10Cr/MCM-41样品取得了最高的催化性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%；而15Cr/MCM-41样品的催化性能最差。

2. 大约270和360 nm的紫外光谱带表示铬酸盐物种的OCr(VI)电荷转移过渡。位于约360 nm的强烈峰，具有孤立Cr(VI)氧化物的特征，在15Cr/MCM-41催化剂中更为明显，表明在高Cr含量的样品中有更多的孤立Cr(VI)物种存在。

3. 在15Cr/MCM-41样品的H2-TPR谱图中，大约280°C处出现了一个额外的还原峰。这被归因于分散在α-Cr2O3结晶体上的Cr(VI)物种的还原。

4. 在高Cr负载下，观察到一些不可活性的Cr(VI)物种，称为孤立的Cr(VI)物种，在15%Cr/MCM-41催化剂上。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种难以还原，并对PDH过程的催化活性产生负面影响。

5. 关于Cr负载的通用知识是，低负载有助于Cr物种的良好分散，导致单核Cr(VI)以及一些具有配位空位的Cr(III)物种。高负载预计会形成较不活跃的聚集体Cr(III)物种。

6. 很少有研究关注孤立的Cr(VI)物种及其对PDH催化活性的影响。当前的工作旨在研究Cr/MCM-41催化剂中的孤立Cr(VI)物种，并分析其对丙烷脱氢催化活性的影响，这对于基于Cr的PDH催化剂系统至关重要。
