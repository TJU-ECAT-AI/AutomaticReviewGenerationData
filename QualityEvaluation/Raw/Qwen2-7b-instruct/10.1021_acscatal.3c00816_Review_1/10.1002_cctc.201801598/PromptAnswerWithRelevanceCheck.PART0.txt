[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
[2] "As far as the PDH catalyst system is concerned, Cr-based catalysts are mainly tested in process."
[3] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[4] "In our present work, to verify the effect of Cr loadings on the nature of the Cr species, Cr/MCM-41 catalysts with different weight of Cr loadings (5, 10, and 15wt%) were prepared."
[5] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species."
[6] "Instead, some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[7] "Moreover, these isolated Cr(VI) species, which exhibits difficulty to be reduced, cause the decreased activity for PDH process."
[8] "In contrast, a good dispersion of the Cr species was obtained using a chromium column adsorption process, and the absence of the isolated state of Cr(VI) species on this sample contributed to high activity toward PDH process."
[9] "Consequently, some of the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species, accompanied by the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups at higher Cr loadings."
[10] "But high Cr loadings are expected to cause the formation less active polymeric Cr(III) species."
[11] "On the other hand, understanding the exact nature of active Cr species under PDH condition is critically important and seem to be the fundamental for controlling the catalyst properties."
[12] "The present literature results indicate that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species has been proposed to be responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reaction."
[13] "Moreover, the presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher-valence state (e.g. Cr(VI)) seems to be necessary for the production of active Cr sites, and could be generally regarded as active centers."
[14] "It is considered that active Cr(VI) species predominate at low Cr loadings, while high loadings result in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."
[15] "The formation of inactive Cr(III) species is attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which can provide anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr(VI) species."
[16] "In fact, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained."
[17] "But high Cr loadings are expected to cause the formation less active polymeric Cr(III) species."
[18] "In our present work, to verify the effect of Cr loadings on the nature of the Cr species, Cr/MCM-41 catalysts with different weight of Cr loadings (5, 10, and 15wt%) were prepared."
[19] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species."
[20] "Instead, some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[21] "Furthermore, these isolated Cr(VI) species, which exhibits difficulty to be reduced, cause the decreased activity for PDH process."
[22] "However, as far as we know, few reports are focused on investigating the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species and their effects on the catalytic activity of PDH reaction."
[23] "Thus, our current work is mainly to study the isolated Cr(VI) species in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts and analyzing its effect on catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane, which deserves significant importance for Cr-based PDH catalyst system."
[24] "From the characterization results of UV-vis and H2-TPR as demonstrated in FigureS2 in ESI, it is shown that the isolated Cr(VI) species, as marked in FigureS2A, lead to the reduction peak divide into two parts (FigureS2B), thus further confirming our current conclusion."
[25] "FigureS3 in ESI shows the Si 2p, O 1s and Cr 2p XPS curves of the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts."
[26] "Moreover, as seen in FigureS3A and FigureS3B, the shift in the Si 2p and O 1s BE of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample is likely caused by the fact the local environment in CrOx domain is different."
[27] "Besides, mechanical mixtures of CrO3 with MCM-41 solid (with Cr content of 1, 5 and 15%) are designed to shed some further light on the nature of active Cr species in the Cr/MCM-41 system, since no interaction between active Cr(VI) species and MCM-41 support is obtained from this mechanical mixing process."
[28] "From the characterization results of UV-vis and H2-TPR as demonstrated in FigureS2 in ESI, it is shown that the isolated Cr(VI) species, as marked in FigureS2A, lead to the reduction peak divide into two parts (FigureS2B), thus further confirming our current conclusion."
[29] "Figure 5 is the FT-IR results for the Cr/MCM-41 samples."
[30] "Moreover, a weak IR band around 905cm1, attributed to a Cr(VI)-O vibration,20 is seen in the tested Cr/MCM-41 samples, which is in accordance with the UV-vis and XPS results."
[31] "Furthermore, it is noted that the high-frequency region from 3200 to 3700cm1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of SiOH bond."
[32] "As a result, inactive Cr(III) species as well as some unexpected isolated Cr(VI) states are found."
[33] "The diagram for the formation of isolated state of Cr(VI) species on Cr/MCM-41 is exhibited in Figure5, on which not all the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species, while some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[34] "In fact, it's worth mentioning that another method for the synthesis of Cr/MCM-41 catalyst, called as Chromium Column Adsorption process and reported in our previous work,13c shows a better dispersion of Cr species over the Cr/MCM-41 sample, as displayed in FigureS6 in ESI (according to the XRF data, the Cr content from this method is close to 15%wt, results are not shown)."
[35] "The observation of the reduction band at about 280C evidences the formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 over the sample from the Chromium Column Adsorption process, which indicates a high content of Cr contains on this catalyst."
[36] "But to our surprise, the high activity towards PDH process over this sample is mainly attributed to the good dispersion of Cr and the absence of isolated state of Cr(VI) species."
[37] "From Figure7, it is clearly seen that higher amounts of CH4 and C2H4 are shown on the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample, possibly resulted from the side reaction of C3H8(g)CH4(g)+C2H4(g) (ΔrHΘ298K=81.7kJ/mol), instead of the occurrence of the main reaction of C3H8(g)C3H6(g)+H2(g) (ΔrHΘ298K=123.8kJ/mol)."
[38] "Thus, these results clearly show that the generated isolated Cr(VI) species lead to the decreased activity toward propane conversion and low selectivity of C3H6 for PDH process, due to the low catalytic activity of the generated isolated Cr(VI) species."
[39] "From FigureS1, it is known that catalyst of mechanical mixing of Cr2O3 with MCM-41 shows no catalytic activity towards PDH, but an improved activity is observed for its oxidized phase (by oxidizing the sample with air at 600C, as shown in Figure8)."
[40] "However, from Figure8B and Figure8C, the existence of the isolated Cr(VI) state results in the lower selectivity of C3H6 during the reaction."

1. The Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, were investigated for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The focus was on VOx and CrOx supported catalysts. The study compared their structural properties and catalytic behavior against traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages included enhanced surface area and uniform pore size, which facilitated better reactivity. Limitations were related to potential deactivation mechanisms, such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

2. The presence of lattice oxygen species on the OMS catalysts influenced their reactivity by participating in redox reactions, which could either activate or deactivate the catalysts. H2 pretreatment could lead to the formation of unwanted compounds that might inhibit the catalyst's activity.

3. The research highlighted the importance of understanding the exact nature of active Cr species under PDH conditions, crucial for controlling catalyst properties. It proposed that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species was responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher valence states was essential for the production of active Cr sites, generally regarded as active centers.

4. The study found that active Cr(VI) species predominated at low Cr loadings, while high loadings led to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, including clusters and crystalline Cr2O3. This formation was attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which provided anchoring sites for stabilizing Cr(VI) species. Low Cr loadings contributed to good dispersion of Cr species, resulting in mononuclear Cr(VI) and some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies.

5. The investigation revealed that at high Cr loading, not all Cr(VI) species were converted to inactive Cr(III) species, instead, some remained as isolated Cr(VI) species. These isolated Cr(VI) species were difficult to reduce, leading to decreased activity in the PDH process. The use of a chromium column adsorption process resulted in better dispersion of Cr species and absence of isolated Cr(VI) species, contributing to high activity in the PDH process.

6. The presence of lattice oxygen species and the high-frequency region of the SiOH bond stretching vibration in the FT-IR analysis indicated the formation of Cr2O3 phases. The shift in the Si 2p and O 1s binding energies suggested differences in the local environment within the CrOx domain, leading to the formation of unexpected isolated Cr(VI) species. The high Cr content in the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample resulted in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species along with isolated Cr(VI) states.

7. The diagrams for the formation of isolated state of Cr(VI) species on Cr/MCM-41 showed that not all Cr(VI) species were converted to inactive Cr(III) species, while some remained as isolated Cr(VI) species on the 15Cr/MCM-41 catalyst. These isolated Cr(VI) species led to the decreased activity toward propane conversion and low selectivity of C3H6 for PDH process due to their low catalytic activity.

8. The Chromium Column Adsorption process resulted in a better dispersion of Cr species over the Cr/MCM-41 sample, showing high activity towards PDH process. This was attributed to the good dispersion of Cr and the absence of isolated state of Cr(VI) species. The oxidized phase of the catalyst mixture showed improved activity compared to its unoxidized counterpart.

9. The presence of isolated Cr(VI) species on the catalyst surface led to a decrease in the selectivity of C3H6 during the PDH reaction, as evidenced by the lower amounts of C2H4 and C2H6 produced. The side reaction of C3H8(g)CH4(g)+C2H4(g) occurred instead of the main reaction of C3H8(g)C3H6(g)+H2(g).

10. The study concluded that understanding and investigating the characters of the formed isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts was crucial for realizing their negative effect on catalytic activity for PDH processes. This was of significant importance for Cr-based PDH catalyst systems, highlighting the need for further research into optimizing catalyst properties and improving reaction efficiency.

1. 金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）中进行了研究。与传统金属氧化物支持物的比较，重点放在结构特性和催化行为上。优点包括增强的表面面积和均匀孔径，有利于更好的反应性。限制因素与氧晶格物种的存在以及H2预处理对催化剂性能和PDH反应中的失活机制有关。

2. OMS催化剂上的氧晶格物种的存在影响了其活性，通过参与还原反应，可能激活或抑制催化剂。H2预处理可能会导致形成干扰催化剂活性的化合物。

3. 研究表明，活性Cr(VI)物种在低Cr负载下占主导地位，而在高负载下会形成不活跃的Cr(III)物种，包括簇状和结晶Cr2O3。这种形成归因于二氧化硅表面羟基团的消耗，它们为稳定Cr(VI)物种提供锚定位点。低Cr负载有助于Cr物种的良好分散，导致单核Cr(VI)和一些具有配位空位的Cr(III)物种。

4. 在高Cr负载下，不是所有Cr(VI)物种都被转化为不活跃的Cr(III)物种，相反，一些作为孤立的Cr(VI)物种存在。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种难以还原，导致PDH过程的活性降低。使用铬柱吸附过程的结果显示了Cr物种的更好分散和无孤立Cr(VI)物种，从而贡献了PDH过程的高活性。

5. 梯度表示Cr(VI)物种在Cr/MCM-41催化剂上的形成表明，并非所有Cr(VI)物种都转化为不活跃的Cr(III)物种，而是一些作为孤立的Cr(VI)物种存在于15Cr/MCM-41催化剂上。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种导致了丙烷转化活性的下降和C3H6在PDH过程中选择性的降低，因为它们的催化活性较低。

6. 铬柱吸附过程导致Cr/MCM-41样品上Cr物种的良好分散，显示出PDH过程的高活性。这主要归因于Cr的良好分散和无孤立状态的Cr(VI)物种。氧化后的催化剂混合物与未氧化的对照相比，活性得到改善。

7. 催化剂表面存在的孤立Cr(VI)物种导致了C3H6在PDH反应期间的选择性降低，如由产生的较低的C2H4和C2H6量所证明。C3H8(g)CH4(g)+C2H4(g)的副反应而非主要反应C3H8(g)C3H6(g)+H2(g)发生。

8. 研究得出结论，理解并研究Cr/MCM-41催化剂上形成孤立Cr(VI)物种的特性对于实现其对PDH过程催化活性的负面影响至关重要。这对于基于Cr的PDH催化剂系统具有重要意义，强调了进一步研究优化催化剂性质和提高反应效率的重要性。

The study investigates the effect of chromium loadings on the nature of chromium species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. At high chromium loadings, the researchers unexpectedly found isolated chromium(VI) species instead of the commonly expected chromium(III) species. These isolated chromium(VI) species are difficult to reduce, leading to decreased activity in propane conversion and low selectivity towards propene. In contrast, a chromium column adsorption process provided better dispersion of chromium species, resulting in high activity towards PDH. The investigation of isolated chromium(VI) species is crucial for understanding and improving the performance of chromium-based PDH catalyst systems. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts decrease initially due to the conversion of active chromium(VI) sites and the formation of coke. The 10 wt% chromium/MCM-41 catalyst showed the best performance with 40% propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour of reaction, while the 15 wt% chromium/MCM-41 catalyst had the poorest performance. Catalysts prepared by mechanical mixing of chromium oxide and MCM-41 showed no activity towards PDH, but their oxidized phase demonstrated improved activity. The presence of isolated chromium(VI) species led to lower selectivity for propene during the reaction.

本研究探讨了在Cr/MCM-41催化剂中不同铬负载对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中铬物种性质的影响。在高铬负载下，研究人员意外地发现了孤立的铬(VI)物种，而不是通常预期的铬(III)物种。这些孤立的铬(VI)物种难以还原，导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性降低。相比之下，通过铬柱吸附过程提供了更好的铬物种分散，从而获得了PDH过程中的高活性。对于铬基PDH催化剂系统的调查孤立的铬(VI)物种至关重要。反应初期，由于主动铬(VI)位点的转化和焦炭的形成，催化剂的活性和选择性下降。10 wt%铬/MCM-41催化剂在1小时反应后显示出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%；而15 wt%铬/MCM-41催化剂的性能最差。通过机械混合制备的铬氧化物和MCM-41催化剂未表现出PDH活性，但其氧化态表现出改善的活性。存在孤立的铬(VI)物种导致反应过程中丙烯的选择性降低。

1. The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions showed a similar trend in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity over time. Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 achieved the highest catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1 hour of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 had the poorest performance.

2. The UV bands at about 270 and 360 nm indicated OCr(VI) charge transfer transitions of chromates species. The intense peak centered at about 360 nm, characteristic for isolated Cr(VI) oxide, was more pronounced in the 15Cr/MCM-41 catalyst, suggesting more isolated Cr(VI) species were present in the sample with higher Cr content.

3. An additional reduction band at about 280°C appeared in the H2-TPR profile of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample. This was attributed to the reduction of Cr(VI) species dispersed on crystalline α-Cr2O3.

4. At high Cr loadings, some inactive Cr(VI) species, referred to as isolated Cr(VI) species, were observed on the 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst. These isolated Cr(VI) species were found to be difficult to reduce and negatively impacted the catalytic activity for PDH process.

5. The general knowledge regarding Cr loadings in catalysts is that low loadings promote good dispersion of Cr species, leading to mononuclear Cr(VI) and some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies. High loadings are expected to form less active polymeric Cr(III) species.

6. Few studies have focused on the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species and their effects on PDH catalytic activity. The current work aimed to investigate the isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts and analyze their impact on the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation, which is crucial for Cr-based PDH catalyst systems.

1. 金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能显示出了随时间变化的相似趋势。在1小时反应后，10Cr/MCM-41样品取得了最高的催化性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%；而15Cr/MCM-41样品的催化性能最差。

2. 大约270和360 nm的紫外光谱带表示铬酸盐物种的OCr(VI)电荷转移过渡。位于约360 nm的强烈峰，具有孤立Cr(VI)氧化物的特征，在15Cr/MCM-41催化剂中更为明显，表明在高Cr含量的样品中有更多的孤立Cr(VI)物种存在。

3. 在15Cr/MCM-41样品的H2-TPR谱图中，大约280°C处出现了一个额外的还原峰。这被归因于分散在α-Cr2O3结晶体上的Cr(VI)物种的还原。

4. 在高Cr负载下，观察到一些不可活性的Cr(VI)物种，称为孤立的Cr(VI)物种，在15%Cr/MCM-41催化剂上。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种难以还原，并对PDH过程的催化活性产生负面影响。

5. 关于Cr负载的通用知识是，低负载有助于Cr物种的良好分散，导致单核Cr(VI)以及一些具有配位空位的Cr(III)物种。高负载预计会形成较不活跃的聚集体Cr(III)物种。

6. 很少有研究关注孤立的Cr(VI)物种及其对PDH催化活性的影响。当前的工作旨在研究Cr/MCM-41催化剂中的孤立Cr(VI)物种，并分析其对丙烷脱氢催化活性的影响，这对于基于Cr的PDH催化剂系统至关重要。

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves comparing their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports. The document highlights several key points regarding these catalysts:

1. **Structural Properties**: MCM-41, with its high surface area and uniform pore size, serves as an effective support for various metals, including VOx and CrOx, in PDH reactions. The mesoporous structure of MCM-41 facilitates efficient mass transport, enhancing catalytic activity.

2. **Catalytic Behavior**:
   - High Cr loadings were initially thought to result in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters or crystalline Cr2O3, due to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups. This leads to a reduction in surface functionality, negatively impacting catalytic activity.
   - Contrary to expectations, isolated Cr(VI) species were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, rather than inactive Cr(III) species. These Cr(VI) states are difficult to reduce, contributing to decreased activity and low selectivity towards C3H6 in PDH processes.
   - A good dispersion of Cr species was achieved through a chromium column adsorption process, which resulted in high activity for PDH processes without the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species.

3. **Reaction Mechanisms**:
   - The redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species plays a crucial role in PDH activity. Active Cr(VI) species predominate at low Cr loadings, while high loadings lead to the formation of less active Cr(III) species, including clusters and crystalline Cr2O3.
   - The presence of oxidized Cr species with higher valence states (Cr(VI)) is essential for the production of active Cr sites, which are considered active centers in PDH reactions.

4. **Advantages and Limitations**:
   - MCM-41 provides a superior support matrix for catalysts due to its high surface area and uniform pore structure, facilitating better catalytic activity compared to traditional metal oxide supports.
   - The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of active Cr species under PDH conditions, particularly the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species, which negatively affects catalytic activity.

5. **Factors Influencing Catalyst Performance**:
   - Lattice oxygen species play a significant role in stabilizing Cr(VI) species, influencing the overall catalytic performance.
   - H2 pretreatment can affect the deactivation of catalysts in PDH reactions by altering the surface chemistry and modifying the active sites, potentially impacting activity and selectivity.

6. **Deactivation Processes**:
   - At high Cr loadings, the formation of inactive Cr(III) species is attributed to the depletion of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which serve as anchoring sites for Cr(VI) species. This leads to a conversion of Cr(VI) species to Cr(III) species, accompanied by a reduction in surface hydroxyl groups.
   - The presence of isolated Cr(VI) species, which are difficult to reduce, contributes to the decreased activity of the catalyst in PDH processes.

Understanding these aspects is crucial for optimizing the design and operation of Cr-based PDH catalyst systems, ensuring high activity, selectivity, and stability during propane dehydrogenation reactions. By investigating the specific characters of isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, researchers can identify their negative impact on catalytic activity, leading to improved catalyst performance and enhanced efficiency in PDH processes.

The document also highlights the importance of considering the type of support used in catalyst preparation, as MCM-41, with its mesoporous structure, is preferred for its ability to enhance the activity of various metal-based catalysts, including Cr-based catalysts for PDH reactions. The use of MCM-41 as a support material, along with careful control of Cr loading and preparation methods, enables the development of highly active and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, contributing significantly to the field of catalysis and chemical engineering.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能涉及到与传统金属氧化物支持的结构特性和催化行为的比较。文档强调了几个关键点关于这些催化剂：

1. **结构特性**：具有高表面积和均匀孔隙结构的MCM-41作为各种金属，包括VOx和CrOx，在PDH反应中的有效支持，其多孔结构有助于提高催化活性。

2. **催化行为**：
   - 高Cr负载被认为会导致形成无活性的Cr(III)物种，如簇或结晶Cr2O3，这是由于硅酸盐表面羟基团的消耗。这导致表面功能性的减少，从而负面影响催化活性。
   - 与预期相反，在Cr/MCM-41催化剂中识别出孤立的Cr(VI)物种，而不是无活性的Cr(III)物种。这些Cr(VI)状态难以还原，导致活性降低和PDH过程中低选择性向C3H6。
   - 通过铬柱吸附过程获得良好的Cr物种分散，导致PDH过程中的高活性，而没有孤立的Cr(VI)物种。

3. **反应机制**：
   - 活性Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的还原循环对PDH活性至关重要。在低Cr负载下，活性Cr(VI)物种占主导地位，而在高负载下，形成较不活跃的Cr(III)物种，包括簇和结晶Cr2O3。
   - 高于Cr(VI)物种的更高价态（Cr(VI)）氧化Cr物种对于产生活性Cr位点是必要的，并且通常被视为活性中心。

4. **优点和限制**：
   - MCM-41提供了一种优越的支持材料，用于催化剂，由于其高表面积和均匀的孔结构，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，可以实现更高的活性。
   - 文档强调了理解PDH条件下活性Cr物种性质的重要性，特别是孤立的Cr(VI)物种的存在，对催化活性有负面影响。

5. **影响催化剂性能的因素**：
   - 格子氧物种在稳定Cr(VI)物种中起着重要作用，影响整体催化性能。
   - H2预处理可能会影响PDH反应中催化剂的失活，通过改变表面化学和修改活性位点，可能影响活性和选择性。

6. **失活过程**：
   - 在高Cr负载下，形成无活性的Cr(III)物种归因于表面羟基团的消耗，这些羟基团作为Cr(VI)物种的锚定位点。这导致Cr(VI)物种转化为Cr(III)物种，伴随着表面羟基团的减少。
   - 孤立的Cr(VI)物种的存在，由于难以还原，导致催化剂在PDH过程中的活性降低。

理解这些方面对于优化Cr基PDH催化剂系统的设计和操作至关重要，确保高活性、选择性和稳定性在丙烷脱氢反应中。通过研究Cr/MCM-41催化剂中特定孤立Cr(VI)物种的特性，研究人员可以识别其对催化活性的负面影响，从而改进催化剂性能并增强PDH过程的效率。

文档还强调了考虑支持材料在催化剂制备中的重要性，MCM-41，由于其多孔结构，被首选用于各种金属基催化剂，包括PDH反应中的Cr基催化剂。使用MCM-41作为支持材料，结合对Cr负载和制备方法的仔细控制，能够开发出高度活跃和选择性的催化剂，为PDH反应做出重大贡献，对催化和化学工程领域有重要意义。

<p>In particular, one high temperature reduction peak located at about 540C can be detected in the case of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample, supposedly caused by the reduction of the isolated Cr(VI) species, which is reported to be difficult to be reduced.11c Thus, the H2-TPR data combined with the UV-vis results confirm part of Cr(VI) species exists as the isolated state in the sample of 15Cr/MCM-41.</p>
<p>Moreover, as seen in FigureS3A and FigureS3B, the shift in the Si 2p and O 1s BE of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample is likely caused by the fact the local environment in CrOx domain is different,19 as revealed that some unexpected isolated state of Cr(VI) species are presented.</p>

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key points. Firstly, the catalysts' structural properties and catalytic behavior differ significantly from those supported on traditional metal oxide supports. For instance, the presence of lattice oxygen species and the impact of hydrogen (H2) pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation are crucial factors. In PDH reactions, lattice oxygen species can enhance the catalyst's activity by facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, H2 pretreatment can improve the catalyst's stability, preventing the formation of coke deposits that deplete the surface area and reduce the catalytic activity. The document highlights the specific effects of CrOx species, noting that the isolated Cr(VI) states negatively impact the catalyst's performance. These states are difficult to reduce, leading to decreased activity in the PDH process. Moreover, the document discusses how the high content of CrOx species, particularly in the form of isolated Cr(VI) states, affects the selectivity of the produced hydrocarbons, particularly C3H6, during PDH reactions. The presence of coke deposits over the spent catalyst further diminishes the catalyst's effectiveness. Overall, the document emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific nature of active Cr species in Cr-based PDH catalyst systems, including the presence and impact of isolated Cr(VI) states, to optimize catalyst performance and deactivation mechanisms.
