[1] "In the present work, to verify the effect of Cr loadings on the nature of the Cr species, Cr/MCM-41 catalysts with different weight of Cr loadings (5, 10, and 15wt%) were prepared."
[2] "As a result, all the samples exhibit a similar trend as a function of time in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[3] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species."
[4] "These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."
[5] "In contrast, a good dispersion of the Cr species was obtained using a chromium column adsorption process, and the absence of the isolated state of Cr(VI) species on this sample contributed to high activity toward PDH process."
[6] "The investigation of the isolated Cr(VI) species is very important for the Cr-based PDH catalyst system."
[7] "The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction."
[8] "Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[9] "From FigureS7B in ESI, it is known that catalyst of mechanical mixing of Cr2O3 with MCM-41 shows no catalytic activity towards PDH, but an improved activity is observed for its oxidized phase (by oxidizing the sample with air at 600C)."
[10] "However, from Figure8B and Figure8C, the existence of the isolated Cr(VI) state results in the lower selectivity of C3H6 during the reaction."

The study investigates the effect of chromium loadings on the nature of chromium species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. At high chromium loadings, the researchers unexpectedly found isolated chromium(VI) species instead of the commonly expected chromium(III) species. These isolated chromium(VI) species are difficult to reduce, leading to decreased activity in propane conversion and low selectivity towards propene. In contrast, a chromium column adsorption process provided better dispersion of chromium species, resulting in high activity towards PDH. The investigation of isolated chromium(VI) species is crucial for understanding and improving the performance of chromium-based PDH catalyst systems. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts decrease initially due to the conversion of active chromium(VI) sites and the formation of coke. The 10 wt% chromium/MCM-41 catalyst showed the best performance with 40% propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity after 1 hour of reaction, while the 15 wt% chromium/MCM-41 catalyst had the poorest performance. Catalysts prepared by mechanical mixing of chromium oxide and MCM-41 showed no activity towards PDH, but their oxidized phase demonstrated improved activity. The presence of isolated chromium(VI) species led to lower selectivity for propene during the reaction.

本研究探讨了在Cr/MCM-41催化剂中不同铬负载对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中铬物种性质的影响。在高铬负载下，研究人员意外地发现了孤立的铬(VI)物种，而不是通常预期的铬(III)物种。这些孤立的铬(VI)物种难以还原，导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性降低。相比之下，通过铬柱吸附过程提供了更好的铬物种分散，从而获得了PDH过程中的高活性。对于铬基PDH催化剂系统的调查孤立的铬(VI)物种至关重要。反应初期，由于主动铬(VI)位点的转化和焦炭的形成，催化剂的活性和选择性下降。10 wt%铬/MCM-41催化剂在1小时反应后显示出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为80%；而15 wt%铬/MCM-41催化剂的性能最差。通过机械混合制备的铬氧化物和MCM-41催化剂未表现出PDH活性，但其氧化态表现出改善的活性。存在孤立的铬(VI)物种导致反应过程中丙烯的选择性降低。
