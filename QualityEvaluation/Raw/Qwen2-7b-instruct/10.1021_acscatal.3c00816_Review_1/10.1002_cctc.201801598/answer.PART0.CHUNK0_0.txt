[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
[2] "As far as the PDH catalyst system is concerned, Cr-based catalysts are mainly tested in process."
[3] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[4] "In our present work, to verify the effect of Cr loadings on the nature of the Cr species, Cr/MCM-41 catalysts with different weight of Cr loadings (5, 10, and 15wt%) were prepared."
[5] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species."
[6] "Instead, some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[7] "Moreover, these isolated Cr(VI) species, which exhibits difficulty to be reduced, cause the decreased activity for PDH process."
[8] "In contrast, a good dispersion of the Cr species was obtained using a chromium column adsorption process, and the absence of the isolated state of Cr(VI) species on this sample contributed to high activity toward PDH process."
[9] "Consequently, some of the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species, accompanied by the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups at higher Cr loadings."
[10] "But high Cr loadings are expected to cause the formation less active polymeric Cr(III) species."
[11] "On the other hand, understanding the exact nature of active Cr species under PDH condition is critically important and seem to be the fundamental for controlling the catalyst properties."
[12] "The present literature results indicate that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species has been proposed to be responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reaction."
[13] "Moreover, the presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher-valence state (e.g. Cr(VI)) seems to be necessary for the production of active Cr sites, and could be generally regarded as active centers."
[14] "It is considered that active Cr(VI) species predominate at low Cr loadings, while high loadings result in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."
[15] "The formation of inactive Cr(III) species is attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which can provide anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr(VI) species."
[16] "In fact, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained."
[17] "But high Cr loadings are expected to cause the formation less active polymeric Cr(III) species."
[18] "In our present work, to verify the effect of Cr loadings on the nature of the Cr species, Cr/MCM-41 catalysts with different weight of Cr loadings (5, 10, and 15wt%) were prepared."
[19] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species."
[20] "Instead, some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[21] "Furthermore, these isolated Cr(VI) species, which exhibits difficulty to be reduced, cause the decreased activity for PDH process."
[22] "However, as far as we know, few reports are focused on investigating the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species and their effects on the catalytic activity of PDH reaction."
[23] "Thus, our current work is mainly to study the isolated Cr(VI) species in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts and analyzing its effect on catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane, which deserves significant importance for Cr-based PDH catalyst system."
[24] "From the characterization results of UV-vis and H2-TPR as demonstrated in FigureS2 in ESI, it is shown that the isolated Cr(VI) species, as marked in FigureS2A, lead to the reduction peak divide into two parts (FigureS2B), thus further confirming our current conclusion."
[25] "FigureS3 in ESI shows the Si 2p, O 1s and Cr 2p XPS curves of the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts."
[26] "Moreover, as seen in FigureS3A and FigureS3B, the shift in the Si 2p and O 1s BE of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample is likely caused by the fact the local environment in CrOx domain is different."
[27] "Besides, mechanical mixtures of CrO3 with MCM-41 solid (with Cr content of 1, 5 and 15%) are designed to shed some further light on the nature of active Cr species in the Cr/MCM-41 system, since no interaction between active Cr(VI) species and MCM-41 support is obtained from this mechanical mixing process."
[28] "From the characterization results of UV-vis and H2-TPR as demonstrated in FigureS2 in ESI, it is shown that the isolated Cr(VI) species, as marked in FigureS2A, lead to the reduction peak divide into two parts (FigureS2B), thus further confirming our current conclusion."
[29] "Figure 5 is the FT-IR results for the Cr/MCM-41 samples."
[30] "Moreover, a weak IR band around 905cm1, attributed to a Cr(VI)-O vibration,20 is seen in the tested Cr/MCM-41 samples, which is in accordance with the UV-vis and XPS results."
[31] "Furthermore, it is noted that the high-frequency region from 3200 to 3700cm1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of SiOH bond."
[32] "As a result, inactive Cr(III) species as well as some unexpected isolated Cr(VI) states are found."
[33] "The diagram for the formation of isolated state of Cr(VI) species on Cr/MCM-41 is exhibited in Figure5, on which not all the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species, while some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[34] "In fact, it's worth mentioning that another method for the synthesis of Cr/MCM-41 catalyst, called as Chromium Column Adsorption process and reported in our previous work,13c shows a better dispersion of Cr species over the Cr/MCM-41 sample, as displayed in FigureS6 in ESI (according to the XRF data, the Cr content from this method is close to 15%wt, results are not shown)."
[35] "The observation of the reduction band at about 280C evidences the formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3 over the sample from the Chromium Column Adsorption process, which indicates a high content of Cr contains on this catalyst."
[36] "But to our surprise, the high activity towards PDH process over this sample is mainly attributed to the good dispersion of Cr and the absence of isolated state of Cr(VI) species."
[37] "From Figure7, it is clearly seen that higher amounts of CH4 and C2H4 are shown on the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample, possibly resulted from the side reaction of C3H8(g)CH4(g)+C2H4(g) (ΔrHΘ298K=81.7kJ/mol), instead of the occurrence of the main reaction of C3H8(g)C3H6(g)+H2(g) (ΔrHΘ298K=123.8kJ/mol)."
[38] "Thus, these results clearly show that the generated isolated Cr(VI) species lead to the decreased activity toward propane conversion and low selectivity of C3H6 for PDH process, due to the low catalytic activity of the generated isolated Cr(VI) species."
[39] "From FigureS1, it is known that catalyst of mechanical mixing of Cr2O3 with MCM-41 shows no catalytic activity towards PDH, but an improved activity is observed for its oxidized phase (by oxidizing the sample with air at 600C, as shown in Figure8)."
[40] "However, from Figure8B and Figure8C, the existence of the isolated Cr(VI) state results in the lower selectivity of C3H6 during the reaction."

1. The Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, were investigated for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The focus was on VOx and CrOx supported catalysts. The study compared their structural properties and catalytic behavior against traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages included enhanced surface area and uniform pore size, which facilitated better reactivity. Limitations were related to potential deactivation mechanisms, such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

2. The presence of lattice oxygen species on the OMS catalysts influenced their reactivity by participating in redox reactions, which could either activate or deactivate the catalysts. H2 pretreatment could lead to the formation of unwanted compounds that might inhibit the catalyst's activity.

3. The research highlighted the importance of understanding the exact nature of active Cr species under PDH conditions, crucial for controlling catalyst properties. It proposed that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species was responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher valence states was essential for the production of active Cr sites, generally regarded as active centers.

4. The study found that active Cr(VI) species predominated at low Cr loadings, while high loadings led to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, including clusters and crystalline Cr2O3. This formation was attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which provided anchoring sites for stabilizing Cr(VI) species. Low Cr loadings contributed to good dispersion of Cr species, resulting in mononuclear Cr(VI) and some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies.

5. The investigation revealed that at high Cr loading, not all Cr(VI) species were converted to inactive Cr(III) species, instead, some remained as isolated Cr(VI) species. These isolated Cr(VI) species were difficult to reduce, leading to decreased activity in the PDH process. The use of a chromium column adsorption process resulted in better dispersion of Cr species and absence of isolated Cr(VI) species, contributing to high activity in the PDH process.

6. The presence of lattice oxygen species and the high-frequency region of the SiOH bond stretching vibration in the FT-IR analysis indicated the formation of Cr2O3 phases. The shift in the Si 2p and O 1s binding energies suggested differences in the local environment within the CrOx domain, leading to the formation of unexpected isolated Cr(VI) species. The high Cr content in the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample resulted in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species along with isolated Cr(VI) states.

7. The diagrams for the formation of isolated state of Cr(VI) species on Cr/MCM-41 showed that not all Cr(VI) species were converted to inactive Cr(III) species, while some remained as isolated Cr(VI) species on the 15Cr/MCM-41 catalyst. These isolated Cr(VI) species led to the decreased activity toward propane conversion and low selectivity of C3H6 for PDH process due to their low catalytic activity.

8. The Chromium Column Adsorption process resulted in a better dispersion of Cr species over the Cr/MCM-41 sample, showing high activity towards PDH process. This was attributed to the good dispersion of Cr and the absence of isolated state of Cr(VI) species. The oxidized phase of the catalyst mixture showed improved activity compared to its unoxidized counterpart.

9. The presence of isolated Cr(VI) species on the catalyst surface led to a decrease in the selectivity of C3H6 during the PDH reaction, as evidenced by the lower amounts of C2H4 and C2H6 produced. The side reaction of C3H8(g)CH4(g)+C2H4(g) occurred instead of the main reaction of C3H8(g)C3H6(g)+H2(g).

10. The study concluded that understanding and investigating the characters of the formed isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts was crucial for realizing their negative effect on catalytic activity for PDH processes. This was of significant importance for Cr-based PDH catalyst systems, highlighting the need for further research into optimizing catalyst properties and improving reaction efficiency.

1. 金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）中进行了研究。与传统金属氧化物支持物的比较，重点放在结构特性和催化行为上。优点包括增强的表面面积和均匀孔径，有利于更好的反应性。限制因素与氧晶格物种的存在以及H2预处理对催化剂性能和PDH反应中的失活机制有关。

2. OMS催化剂上的氧晶格物种的存在影响了其活性，通过参与还原反应，可能激活或抑制催化剂。H2预处理可能会导致形成干扰催化剂活性的化合物。

3. 研究表明，活性Cr(VI)物种在低Cr负载下占主导地位，而在高负载下会形成不活跃的Cr(III)物种，包括簇状和结晶Cr2O3。这种形成归因于二氧化硅表面羟基团的消耗，它们为稳定Cr(VI)物种提供锚定位点。低Cr负载有助于Cr物种的良好分散，导致单核Cr(VI)和一些具有配位空位的Cr(III)物种。

4. 在高Cr负载下，不是所有Cr(VI)物种都被转化为不活跃的Cr(III)物种，相反，一些作为孤立的Cr(VI)物种存在。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种难以还原，导致PDH过程的活性降低。使用铬柱吸附过程的结果显示了Cr物种的更好分散和无孤立Cr(VI)物种，从而贡献了PDH过程的高活性。

5. 梯度表示Cr(VI)物种在Cr/MCM-41催化剂上的形成表明，并非所有Cr(VI)物种都转化为不活跃的Cr(III)物种，而是一些作为孤立的Cr(VI)物种存在于15Cr/MCM-41催化剂上。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种导致了丙烷转化活性的下降和C3H6在PDH过程中选择性的降低，因为它们的催化活性较低。

6. 铬柱吸附过程导致Cr/MCM-41样品上Cr物种的良好分散，显示出PDH过程的高活性。这主要归因于Cr的良好分散和无孤立状态的Cr(VI)物种。氧化后的催化剂混合物与未氧化的对照相比，活性得到改善。

7. 催化剂表面存在的孤立Cr(VI)物种导致了C3H6在PDH反应期间的选择性降低，如由产生的较低的C2H4和C2H6量所证明。C3H8(g)CH4(g)+C2H4(g)的副反应而非主要反应C3H8(g)C3H6(g)+H2(g)发生。

8. 研究得出结论，理解并研究Cr/MCM-41催化剂上形成孤立Cr(VI)物种的特性对于实现其对PDH过程催化活性的负面影响至关重要。这对于基于Cr的PDH催化剂系统具有重要意义，强调了进一步研究优化催化剂性质和提高反应效率的重要性。
