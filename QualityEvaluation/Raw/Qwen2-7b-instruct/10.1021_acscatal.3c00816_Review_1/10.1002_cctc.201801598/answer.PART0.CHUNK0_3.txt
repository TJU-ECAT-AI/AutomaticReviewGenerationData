[1] "Cr-modified MCM-41 with different loadings were prepared and tested in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."
[2] "As for Cr/MCM-41 system, the general knowledge was that high Cr loadings resulted in the reduction of silica surface hydroxyl groups, thus leading to the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."
[3] "However, in the present work, isolated Cr(VI) states were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, instead of Cr(III) species, using UV-vis and H2-TPR."
[4] "These isolated Cr(VI) species are difficult to reduce, causing the decreased activity for propane conversion and low selectivity towards C3H6 in the PDH process."
[5] "In contrast, a good dispersion of the Cr species was obtained using a chromium column adsorption process, and the absence of the isolated state of Cr(VI) species on this sample contributed to high activity toward PDH process."
[6] "In our present work, to verify the effect of Cr loadings on the nature of the Cr species, Cr/MCM-41 catalysts with different weight of Cr loadings (5, 10, and 15wt%) were prepared."
[7] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species."
[8] "Instead, some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[9] "Furthermore, these isolated Cr(VI) species, which exhibits difficulty to be reduced, cause the decreased activity for PDH process."
[10] "But high Cr loadings are expected to cause the formation less active polymeric Cr(III) species."
[11] "The formation of inactive Cr(III) species is attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which can provide anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr(VI) species."
[12] "Consequently, some of the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species, accompanied by the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups at higher Cr loadings."
[13] "On the other hand, understanding and investigating the characters of the formed isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts can be used to realize its negative effect on catalytic activity for PDH process."
[14] "It was shown that some inactive Cr(VI) states regarded as the isolated Cr(VI) species were found over the high Cr content Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[15] "Instead, the previous general knowledge is that high Cr loadings can cause the generation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."
[16] "Therefore, understanding and investigating the characters of the formed isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts can be used to realize its negative effect on catalytic activity for PDH process."
[17] "It is accepted that the type of the support can influence the PDH catalytic activity, and mesoporous silica-based material, MCM-41, with high surface area and uniform pore size is preferentially used as support for a preparation of different kinds of catalysts."
[18] "Cr supported on MCM-41 catalyst has been tested and proved to be a highly active catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[19] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[20] "Moreover, the presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher-valence state (e.g. Cr(VI)) seems to be necessary for the production of active Cr sites, and could be generally regarded as active centers."
[21] "It is considered that active Cr(VI) species predominate at low Cr loadings, while high loadings result in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3."
[22] "The formation of inactive Cr(III) species is attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which can provide anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr(VI) species."
[23] "Consequently, some of the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species, accompanied by the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups at higher Cr loadings."
[24] "The present literature results indicate that the redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species has been proposed to be responsible for the activity of dehydrogenation reaction."
[25] "As far as we know, few reports are focused on investigating the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species and their effects on the catalytic activity of PDH reaction."
[26] "Thus, our current work is mainly to study the isolated Cr(VI) species in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts and analyzing its effect on catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane, which deserves significant importance for Cr-based PDH catalyst system."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves comparing their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports. The document highlights several key points regarding these catalysts:

1. **Structural Properties**: MCM-41, with its high surface area and uniform pore size, serves as an effective support for various metals, including VOx and CrOx, in PDH reactions. The mesoporous structure of MCM-41 facilitates efficient mass transport, enhancing catalytic activity.

2. **Catalytic Behavior**:
   - High Cr loadings were initially thought to result in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters or crystalline Cr2O3, due to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups. This leads to a reduction in surface functionality, negatively impacting catalytic activity.
   - Contrary to expectations, isolated Cr(VI) species were identified in the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, rather than inactive Cr(III) species. These Cr(VI) states are difficult to reduce, contributing to decreased activity and low selectivity towards C3H6 in PDH processes.
   - A good dispersion of Cr species was achieved through a chromium column adsorption process, which resulted in high activity for PDH processes without the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species.

3. **Reaction Mechanisms**:
   - The redox cycle between active Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species plays a crucial role in PDH activity. Active Cr(VI) species predominate at low Cr loadings, while high loadings lead to the formation of less active Cr(III) species, including clusters and crystalline Cr2O3.
   - The presence of oxidized Cr species with higher valence states (Cr(VI)) is essential for the production of active Cr sites, which are considered active centers in PDH reactions.

4. **Advantages and Limitations**:
   - MCM-41 provides a superior support matrix for catalysts due to its high surface area and uniform pore structure, facilitating better catalytic activity compared to traditional metal oxide supports.
   - The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of active Cr species under PDH conditions, particularly the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species, which negatively affects catalytic activity.

5. **Factors Influencing Catalyst Performance**:
   - Lattice oxygen species play a significant role in stabilizing Cr(VI) species, influencing the overall catalytic performance.
   - H2 pretreatment can affect the deactivation of catalysts in PDH reactions by altering the surface chemistry and modifying the active sites, potentially impacting activity and selectivity.

6. **Deactivation Processes**:
   - At high Cr loadings, the formation of inactive Cr(III) species is attributed to the depletion of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which serve as anchoring sites for Cr(VI) species. This leads to a conversion of Cr(VI) species to Cr(III) species, accompanied by a reduction in surface hydroxyl groups.
   - The presence of isolated Cr(VI) species, which are difficult to reduce, contributes to the decreased activity of the catalyst in PDH processes.

Understanding these aspects is crucial for optimizing the design and operation of Cr-based PDH catalyst systems, ensuring high activity, selectivity, and stability during propane dehydrogenation reactions. By investigating the specific characters of isolated Cr(VI) species in Cr/MCM-41 catalysts, researchers can identify their negative impact on catalytic activity, leading to improved catalyst performance and enhanced efficiency in PDH processes.

The document also highlights the importance of considering the type of support used in catalyst preparation, as MCM-41, with its mesoporous structure, is preferred for its ability to enhance the activity of various metal-based catalysts, including Cr-based catalysts for PDH reactions. The use of MCM-41 as a support material, along with careful control of Cr loading and preparation methods, enables the development of highly active and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, contributing significantly to the field of catalysis and chemical engineering.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能涉及到与传统金属氧化物支持的结构特性和催化行为的比较。文档强调了几个关键点关于这些催化剂：

1. **结构特性**：具有高表面积和均匀孔隙结构的MCM-41作为各种金属，包括VOx和CrOx，在PDH反应中的有效支持，其多孔结构有助于提高催化活性。

2. **催化行为**：
   - 高Cr负载被认为会导致形成无活性的Cr(III)物种，如簇或结晶Cr2O3，这是由于硅酸盐表面羟基团的消耗。这导致表面功能性的减少，从而负面影响催化活性。
   - 与预期相反，在Cr/MCM-41催化剂中识别出孤立的Cr(VI)物种，而不是无活性的Cr(III)物种。这些Cr(VI)状态难以还原，导致活性降低和PDH过程中低选择性向C3H6。
   - 通过铬柱吸附过程获得良好的Cr物种分散，导致PDH过程中的高活性，而没有孤立的Cr(VI)物种。

3. **反应机制**：
   - 活性Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的还原循环对PDH活性至关重要。在低Cr负载下，活性Cr(VI)物种占主导地位，而在高负载下，形成较不活跃的Cr(III)物种，包括簇和结晶Cr2O3。
   - 高于Cr(VI)物种的更高价态（Cr(VI)）氧化Cr物种对于产生活性Cr位点是必要的，并且通常被视为活性中心。

4. **优点和限制**：
   - MCM-41提供了一种优越的支持材料，用于催化剂，由于其高表面积和均匀的孔结构，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，可以实现更高的活性。
   - 文档强调了理解PDH条件下活性Cr物种性质的重要性，特别是孤立的Cr(VI)物种的存在，对催化活性有负面影响。

5. **影响催化剂性能的因素**：
   - 格子氧物种在稳定Cr(VI)物种中起着重要作用，影响整体催化性能。
   - H2预处理可能会影响PDH反应中催化剂的失活，通过改变表面化学和修改活性位点，可能影响活性和选择性。

6. **失活过程**：
   - 在高Cr负载下，形成无活性的Cr(III)物种归因于表面羟基团的消耗，这些羟基团作为Cr(VI)物种的锚定位点。这导致Cr(VI)物种转化为Cr(III)物种，伴随着表面羟基团的减少。
   - 孤立的Cr(VI)物种的存在，由于难以还原，导致催化剂在PDH过程中的活性降低。

理解这些方面对于优化Cr基PDH催化剂系统的设计和操作至关重要，确保高活性、选择性和稳定性在丙烷脱氢反应中。通过研究Cr/MCM-41催化剂中特定孤立Cr(VI)物种的特性，研究人员可以识别其对催化活性的负面影响，从而改进催化剂性能并增强PDH过程的效率。

文档还强调了考虑支持材料在催化剂制备中的重要性，MCM-41，由于其多孔结构，被首选用于各种金属基催化剂，包括PDH反应中的Cr基催化剂。使用MCM-41作为支持材料，结合对Cr负载和制备方法的仔细控制，能够开发出高度活跃和选择性的催化剂，为PDH反应做出重大贡献，对催化和化学工程领域有重要意义。
