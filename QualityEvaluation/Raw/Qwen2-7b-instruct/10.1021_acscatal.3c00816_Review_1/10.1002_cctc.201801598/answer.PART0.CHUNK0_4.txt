<p>As a result, all the samples exhibit a similar trend as a function of time in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity. The decrease in the activity within initial 40min of running time could be attributed to the conversion of part of the active Cr(VI) sites and the formation of coke during the PDH reaction,4b,15 as revealed in the followings.</p>

<p>Sample 10Cr/MCM-41 obtains the best catalytic performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 80% after 1h of reaction, whereas sample 15Cr/MCM-41 shows the poorest catalytic performance with regard to propane conversion and propene selectivity.</p>
<p>From Figure2B, UV bands at about 270 and 360nm express OCr(VI) charge transfer transitions of chromates species.17 Specifically, the intense peak centered at about 360nm, which is characteristic for isolated Cr(VI) oxide,11c is more pronounced in the 15Cr/MCM-41 catalyst, indicating more isolated Cr(VI) species are presented in the case of the samples with a high Cr content.</p>
<p>In particular, one high temperature reduction peak located at about 540C can be detected in the case of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample, supposedly caused by the reduction of the isolated Cr(VI) species, which is reported to be difficult to be reduced.11c Thus, the H2-TPR data combined with the UV-vis results confirm part of Cr(VI) species exists as the isolated state in the sample of 15Cr/MCM-41.</p>
<p>Moreover, as seen in FigureS3A and FigureS3B, the shift in the Si 2p and O 1s BE of the 15Cr/MCM-41 sample is likely caused by the fact the local environment in CrOx domain is different,19 as revealed that some unexpected isolated state of Cr(VI) species are presented.</p>
<p>However, from Figure8B and Figure8C, the existence of the isolated Cr(VI) state results in the lower selectivity of C3H6 during the reaction.</p>
<p>It is seen that Raman signals at about 1380 and 1610cm1, representing for the accumulation of coke deposit over the spent catalyst,23 are found in the spent 15Cr/MCM-41 sample.</p>

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key points. Firstly, the catalysts' structural properties and catalytic behavior differ significantly from those supported on traditional metal oxide supports. For instance, the presence of lattice oxygen species and the impact of hydrogen (H2) pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation are crucial factors. In PDH reactions, lattice oxygen species can enhance the catalyst's activity by facilitating the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, H2 pretreatment can improve the catalyst's stability, preventing the formation of coke deposits that deplete the surface area and reduce the catalytic activity. The document highlights the specific effects of CrOx species, noting that the isolated Cr(VI) states negatively impact the catalyst's performance. These states are difficult to reduce, leading to decreased activity in the PDH process. Moreover, the document discusses how the high content of CrOx species, particularly in the form of isolated Cr(VI) states, affects the selectivity of the produced hydrocarbons, particularly C3H6, during PDH reactions. The presence of coke deposits over the spent catalyst further diminishes the catalyst's effectiveness. Overall, the document emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific nature of active Cr species in Cr-based PDH catalyst systems, including the presence and impact of isolated Cr(VI) states, to optimize catalyst performance and deactivation mechanisms.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能揭示了一些关键点。首先，这些催化剂的结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物支持的催化剂大不相同。例如，晶格氧物种的存在以及氢（H2）预处理对催化剂性能和失活的影响是至关重要的因素。在PDH反应中，晶格氧物种可以通过促进脱氢过程来增强催化剂的活性。同时，H2预处理可以提高催化剂的稳定性，防止形成消耗表面面积并降低催化活性的焦炭沉积物。文档特别讨论了CrOx物种的影响，指出孤立的Cr(VI)状态对催化剂性能产生负面影响。这些状态难以还原，导致PDH过程中活性降低。此外，文档讨论了CrOx物种高含量，尤其是以孤立的Cr(VI)状态形式，如何影响生成的烃类产物的产率，特别是C3H6，在PDH反应中的选择性。进一步地，文档强调了理解Cr基PDH催化剂系统中活性Cr物种的具体性质的重要性，包括孤立的Cr(VI)状态的存在及其影响，以优化催化剂性能和失活机制。
