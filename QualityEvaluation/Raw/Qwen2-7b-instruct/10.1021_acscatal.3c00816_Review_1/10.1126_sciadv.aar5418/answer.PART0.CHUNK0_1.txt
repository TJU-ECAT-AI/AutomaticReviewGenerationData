Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, including MCM-41 and SBA-15, have been extensively studied for their application in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.
These materials are known for their unique mesoporous structures, which offer high surface areas and controlled pore sizes, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.
VOx and CrOx supported on OMS have demonstrated promising results in PDH, with some reports highlighting superior performance compared to traditional metal oxide supports.
Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the activity and selectivity of these catalysts, influencing the reaction pathways and product distribution.
H2 pretreatment has been shown to improve catalyst stability and efficiency by facilitating the activation of lattice oxygen, which is essential for the PDH process.
The structural properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15, such as their ordered mesoporosity, contribute to enhanced mass transfer rates and better resistance to sintering, leading to improved long-term performance.
Advantages of using OMS-based catalysts include higher yield of olefins, lower energy consumption, and reduced formation of byproducts compared to conventional metal oxides.
Limitations include potential leaching of supported metals under certain reaction conditions, necessitating the development of more robust support materials.
Mechanisms underlying the enhanced performance of OMS-supported catalysts involve the synergistic interaction between the metal species and the mesoporous matrix, optimizing the electronic structure and reactivity of the active sites.
Factors affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions include temperature, pressure, reaction time, and the presence of inhibitors or poisoning agents.
