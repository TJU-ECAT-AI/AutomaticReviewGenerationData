[1] "Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, have been extensively studied for their potential application in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."
[2] "These OMS materials, when supported with VOx and CrOx, exhibit unique structural properties that differentiate them from traditional metal oxide supports."
[3] "In PDH reactions, the performance of these catalysts is influenced by several factors, including lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment."
[4] "The presence of lattice oxygen species can enhance the catalytic activity of the OMS-supported VOx and CrOx catalysts."
[5] "Hydrogen pretreatment can further improve the stability and efficiency of the catalysts, mitigating deactivation."
