Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, have been studied for their use in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials possess distinctive structural properties compared to conventional metal oxide supports. Lattice oxygen species significantly influence the catalytic activity of these OMS-based catalysts. Pre-treatment with hydrogen gas has been demonstrated to improve the performance of these catalysts in PDH reactions. Nonetheless, both MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts encounter limitations in terms of stability and the rate of deactivation over time.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15，已被广泛研究用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。这些材料在结构特性上与传统金属氧化物支持材料有显著差异。晶格氧物种在这些OMS基催化剂的催化活性中起着关键作用。预处理氢气已经证明可以提高这些催化剂在PDH反应中的性能。然而，MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在稳定性和随时间的失活方面都遇到了限制。
