Performance analysis of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, including MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was conducted in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Their structural characteristics and catalytic activities were contrasted with conventional metal oxide supports. The investigation underscored the significance of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pre-treatment on catalyst performance and deactivation during PDH reactions.
