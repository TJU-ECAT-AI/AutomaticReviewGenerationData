Performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials were studied alongside traditional metal oxide supports to compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influenced catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
