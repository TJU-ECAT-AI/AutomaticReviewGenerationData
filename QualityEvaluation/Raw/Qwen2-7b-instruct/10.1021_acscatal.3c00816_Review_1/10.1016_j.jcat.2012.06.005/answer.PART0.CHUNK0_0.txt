[1] "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
[2] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."
[3] "In order to prove if catalyst reduction is mandatory for olefin production and for on-stream stability, catalytic tests were performed both with oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3)."
[4] "In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles."
[5] "An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that in contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the DH reaction because oxidized and reduced VOx species are comparable in their activity and on-stream stability."

1. The primary objective of the research was to examine the capabilities of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, with a special emphasis on long-term stability. 

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathway is more thermodynamically favorable than non-oxidative dehydrogenation, allowing for higher conversion at lower temperatures.

3. To ascertain whether catalyst reduction is essential for olefin production and on-stream stability, the researchers conducted experiments with both oxidized and reduced catalysts.

4. In situ UV/Vis analysis combined with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of used catalysts helped in understanding the reasons behind catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and across multiple cycles.

5. A key advantage of the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst is that it doesn't necessitate a reductive activation for PDH compared to PtSn/Al2O3, as both oxidized and reduced VOx species exhibit similar activity and on-stream stability.

1. 研究的主要目标是探索在没有气体相氧的情况下，高度分散的VOx物种支持在介孔二氧化硅（MCM-41）上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的可能性，特别是长寿命稳定性。

2. 与非氧化性脱氢相比，氧化性脱氢（ODH）途径从热力学角度来看更具吸引力。反应是放热的，因此可以在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。

3. 为了确定催化剂还原是否对烯烃生成和在线稳定性至关重要，研究人员对氧化态和还原态催化剂进行了实验。

4. 原位UV/Vis分析结合热程序氧化（TPO）可以帮助我们了解单个PDH周期内和多个周期内催化剂降解的原因。

5. VOx/MCM-41催化剂的一个关键优点是它不需要还原激活即可进行PDH，这与PtSn/Al2O3不同，因为氧化态和还原态的VOx物种在活动性和在线稳定性方面具有相似性。
