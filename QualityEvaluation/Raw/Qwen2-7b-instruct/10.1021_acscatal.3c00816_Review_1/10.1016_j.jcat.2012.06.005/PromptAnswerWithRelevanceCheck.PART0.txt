[1] "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
[2] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."
[3] "In order to prove if catalyst reduction is mandatory for olefin production and for on-stream stability, catalytic tests were performed both with oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3)."
[4] "In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles."
[5] "An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that in contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the DH reaction because oxidized and reduced VOx species are comparable in their activity and on-stream stability."

1. The primary objective of the research was to examine the capabilities of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, with a special emphasis on long-term stability. 

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathway is more thermodynamically favorable than non-oxidative dehydrogenation, allowing for higher conversion at lower temperatures.

3. To ascertain whether catalyst reduction is essential for olefin production and on-stream stability, the researchers conducted experiments with both oxidized and reduced catalysts.

4. In situ UV/Vis analysis combined with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of used catalysts helped in understanding the reasons behind catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and across multiple cycles.

5. A key advantage of the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst is that it doesn't necessitate a reductive activation for PDH compared to PtSn/Al2O3, as both oxidized and reduced VOx species exhibit similar activity and on-stream stability.

1. 研究的主要目标是探索在没有气体相氧的情况下，高度分散的VOx物种支持在介孔二氧化硅（MCM-41）上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的可能性，特别是长寿命稳定性。

2. 与非氧化性脱氢相比，氧化性脱氢（ODH）途径从热力学角度来看更具吸引力。反应是放热的，因此可以在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。

3. 为了确定催化剂还原是否对烯烃生成和在线稳定性至关重要，研究人员对氧化态和还原态催化剂进行了实验。

4. 原位UV/Vis分析结合热程序氧化（TPO）可以帮助我们了解单个PDH周期内和多个周期内催化剂降解的原因。

5. VOx/MCM-41催化剂的一个关键优点是它不需要还原激活即可进行PDH，这与PtSn/Al2O3不同，因为氧化态和还原态的VOx物种在活动性和在线稳定性方面具有相似性。

Comparative study of propane dehydrogenation over V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts: Time on-stream behavior and origins of deactivation Abstract Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles.
Graphical abstract V- and Cr oxide-based catalysts with highly dispersed metal oxide species were prepared using MCM-41 as a support and tested in propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41 retained its activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles thanks to high stability of VOx species, whereas CrOx/MCM-41 gradually lost activity as aggregation of CrOx species occurred.
Highlights V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts were tested in non-oxidative C3H8 dehydrogenation (DH).  VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles.  Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle.  The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle.  VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated.

The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts showed superior time on-stream stability, retaining their activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles, due to the high stability of the VOx species. In contrast, the CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts gradually lost activity as the CrOx species aggregated. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts also lost their activity from cycle to cycle. The VOx species remained unchanged over four PDH cycles, while the CrOx species aggregated, explaining the differences in catalyst performance and deactivation. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts retained their initial activity and selectivity after oxidative regeneration, while the CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed gradual loss of activity.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能被分析。VOx/MCM-41催化剂显示出时间在流上稳定性，通过四个脱氢/氧化再生周期保持其活性，由于VOx物种的高稳定性。相比之下，CrOx/MCM-41催化剂逐渐失去活性，因为CrOx物种聚集。PtSn/Al2O3催化剂也从周期到周期失去了活性。VOx物种在四个PDH周期中保持不变，而CrOx物种聚集，解释了催化剂性能和失活的差异。在氧化再生后，VOx/MCM-41催化剂完全恢复了初始活性和选择性，而CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的活性逐渐下降。

[2] "The propene STY values obtained over oxidized catalysts were in the range between 0.15 and ."
[3] "As shown in Fig. 2 b, the propene selectivity was very similar over oxidized and reduced catalysts."
[4] "For all the catalysts studied, the yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle decreased with time due to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition as will be demonstrated in Section 3.3."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights the comparative study of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. The MCM-41 support provides a high surface area and pore volume, enhancing the dispersion of metal oxides (VOx and CrOx) on the catalyst. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts showed superior time-on-stream stability in PDH cycles, retaining their activity through multiple cycles without significant deactivation. This stability is attributed to the high dispersion of VOx species, which remains unchanged throughout the PDH cycles, allowing for complete recovery of activity via oxidative regeneration.

CrOx/MCM-41, on the other hand, experienced gradual loss of activity from cycle to cycle due to the aggregation of CrOx species. This structural change affects the catalytic performance, leading to a decrease in activity over time. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, while showing high activity initially, also lost its performance over cycles, mainly due to sintering of the alloy particles.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reactions, with oxidized MeOx species being more active than their reduced forms. H2 pretreatment increases the activity of CrOx/MCM-41, but it is not as effective as for PtSn/Al2O3. The high dispersion of VOx species on MCM-41 allows for efficient utilization of the lattice oxygen, which contributes to the stability and efficiency of the catalyst.

The use of MCM-41 as a support for VOx and CrOx overcomes limitations associated with traditional metal oxide supports, offering improved catalytic behavior in PDH reactions. The ability of VOx/MCM-41 to fully recover its activity after oxidative regeneration sets it apart from CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, making it a more stable and promising catalyst for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation.

In summary, the study reveals that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts demonstrate superior performance and stability in PDH reactions, with the key factors governing this behavior being the high dispersion of VOx species, efficient utilization of lattice oxygen, and the absence of significant structural changes during the reaction cycles.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂的研究比较了V、Cr和Pt基催化剂在MCM-41和SBA-15上的性能。MCM-41支持提供了高比表面积和孔体积，促进了金属氧化物（VOx和CrOx）的高分散。VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH循环中表现出出色的长时间稳定性，在多次循环中保持其活性，无需显著失活。这种稳定性归因于VOx物种的高度分散，它们在整个PDH循环中保持不变，允许通过氧化再生完全恢复活性。

CrOx/MCM-41催化剂经历了从一个循环到另一个循环的活性逐渐下降，主要是由于CrOx物种的聚集。这种结构变化影响催化性能，导致活性随时间逐渐下降。PtSn/Al2O3催化剂虽然初始活性较高，但在多个循环中也失去了性能，主要原因是合金颗粒的烧结。

氧化态MeOx物种在PDH反应中起着关键作用，与它们的还原形式相比，氧化态MeOx物种更活跃。H2预处理增加了CrOx/MCM-41的活性，但不如PtSn/Al2O3有效。MCM-41作为支持物，用于VOx和CrOx，克服了传统金属氧化物支持物的局限性，提供更好的催化行为在PDH反应。

总结起来，研究表明，VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能和稳定性，关键因素是VOx物种的高度分散，有效地利用了晶格氧，以及反应周期中没有明显的结构变化。

VOx/MCM-41 showed superior time-on-stream stability, maintaining its activity throughout four PDH cycles (24 hours each) and fully recovering its activity post-oxidative regeneration. The use of H2 for reduction affected the properties of the catalysts differently, with VOx species remaining stable while CrOx species aggregated. The study also highlighted the advantages of using OMS supports over traditional metal oxide supports, especially in achieving high alkene selectivity and extended stability. The origins of catalyst deactivation were elucidated through in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation analysis, revealing that the nature of active VOx species was not changed under the reaction conditions, unlike CrOx species which aggregated over time.
