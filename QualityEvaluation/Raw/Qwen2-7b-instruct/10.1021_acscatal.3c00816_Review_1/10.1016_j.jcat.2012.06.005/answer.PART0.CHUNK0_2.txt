[1] "In order to prove if catalyst reduction is mandatory for olefin production and for on-stream stability, catalytic tests were performed both with oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3)."
[2] "The propene STY values obtained over oxidized catalysts were in the range between 0.15 and ."
[3] "As shown in Fig. 2 b, the propene selectivity was very similar over oxidized and reduced catalysts."
[4] "For all the catalysts studied, the yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle decreased with time due to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition as will be demonstrated in Section 3.3."
[5] "The TPO profiles of VOx/MCM-41 after the 1st cycle feature a single CO2 release event starting at 510 K and extending as a low flat shoulder to 880 K with the maximum at 670 K."
[6] "It should be stressed, however, that even the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst formed less than 2 wt.% of carbon deposits related to the total amount of propene formed."
[7] "The following discussion is aimed to elucidate the roles of reduced and oxidized MeOx species in the DH reaction."
[8] "This leveling off suggests that the nature of active sites formed upon reduction of fully oxidized MeOx is similar irrespective of the reducing agent (H2 or C3H8)."
[9] "However, during the H2 treatment, lattice oxygen of PtOx and SnOx species is easily removed as water at 823 K."
[10] "Therefore, not only the amount of surface carbon species, but also their nature may determine the deactivation rate."
[11] "What changes occurred (or did not) in these two catalysts with time on-stream?"
[12] "No changes were identified in the respective spectra of VOx/MCM-41 proving that the nature of VOx species was not changed, that is, they remained highly dispersed."
[13] "Based on [33], this band in the oxidized catalyst is induced by nanocrystalline Cr2O3."
[14] "In terms of on-stream stability, VOx/MCM-41 clearly surpasses industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 tested under the same reaction conditions."
[15] "In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the literature highlights the comparative study of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15. The MCM-41 support provides a high surface area and pore volume, enhancing the dispersion of metal oxides (VOx and CrOx) on the catalyst. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts showed superior time-on-stream stability in PDH cycles, retaining their activity through multiple cycles without significant deactivation. This stability is attributed to the high dispersion of VOx species, which remains unchanged throughout the PDH cycles, allowing for complete recovery of activity via oxidative regeneration.

CrOx/MCM-41, on the other hand, experienced gradual loss of activity from cycle to cycle due to the aggregation of CrOx species. This structural change affects the catalytic performance, leading to a decrease in activity over time. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, while showing high activity initially, also lost its performance over cycles, mainly due to sintering of the alloy particles.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reactions, with oxidized MeOx species being more active than their reduced forms. H2 pretreatment increases the activity of CrOx/MCM-41, but it is not as effective as for PtSn/Al2O3. The high dispersion of VOx species on MCM-41 allows for efficient utilization of the lattice oxygen, which contributes to the stability and efficiency of the catalyst.

The use of MCM-41 as a support for VOx and CrOx overcomes limitations associated with traditional metal oxide supports, offering improved catalytic behavior in PDH reactions. The ability of VOx/MCM-41 to fully recover its activity after oxidative regeneration sets it apart from CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3, making it a more stable and promising catalyst for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation.

In summary, the study reveals that VOx/MCM-41 catalysts demonstrate superior performance and stability in PDH reactions, with the key factors governing this behavior being the high dispersion of VOx species, efficient utilization of lattice oxygen, and the absence of significant structural changes during the reaction cycles.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂的研究比较了V、Cr和Pt基催化剂在MCM-41和SBA-15上的性能。MCM-41支持提供了高比表面积和孔体积，促进了金属氧化物（VOx和CrOx）的高分散。VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH循环中表现出出色的长时间稳定性，在多次循环中保持其活性，无需显著失活。这种稳定性归因于VOx物种的高度分散，它们在整个PDH循环中保持不变，允许通过氧化再生完全恢复活性。

CrOx/MCM-41催化剂经历了从一个循环到另一个循环的活性逐渐下降，主要是由于CrOx物种的聚集。这种结构变化影响催化性能，导致活性随时间逐渐下降。PtSn/Al2O3催化剂虽然初始活性较高，但在多个循环中也失去了性能，主要原因是合金颗粒的烧结。

氧化态MeOx物种在PDH反应中起着关键作用，与它们的还原形式相比，氧化态MeOx物种更活跃。H2预处理增加了CrOx/MCM-41的活性，但不如PtSn/Al2O3有效。MCM-41作为支持物，用于VOx和CrOx，克服了传统金属氧化物支持物的局限性，提供更好的催化行为在PDH反应。

总结起来，研究表明，VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能和稳定性，关键因素是VOx物种的高度分散，有效地利用了晶格氧，以及反应周期中没有明显的结构变化。
