[1] "Comparative study of propane dehydrogenation over V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts: Time on-stream behavior and origins of deactivation Abstract Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles."
[2] "In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation."
[3] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."
[4] "The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts DH properties was also investigated."
[5] "VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated."
[6] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view."
[7] "Vanadium-based catalysts were also studied in DH of C3C4 alkanes in the absence of gas-phase O2."
[8] "In order to achieve high alkene selectivity and extended on-stream stability, Pt must be alloyed with other elements such as Sn, Ge, or In."
[9] "Suppressed coke formation resulted in a stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts over at least 20 h on-stream compared to 3060 min for VOx/Al2O3."
[10] "Mechanistic origins governing catalysts stability within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles were elucidated by time-resolved in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts after DH cycles."

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the study compared VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. VOx/MCM-41 showed superior time-on-stream stability, maintaining its activity throughout four PDH cycles (24 hours each) and fully recovering its activity post-oxidative regeneration. The use of H2 for reduction affected the properties of the catalysts differently, with VOx species remaining stable while CrOx species aggregated. The study also highlighted the advantages of using OMS supports over traditional metal oxide supports, especially in achieving high alkene selectivity and extended stability. The origins of catalyst deactivation were elucidated through in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation analysis, revealing that the nature of active VOx species was not changed under the reaction conditions, unlike CrOx species which aggregated over time.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，研究比较了VOx/MCM-41、CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。VOx/MCM-41表现出优越的时间在线稳定性，在四个PDH周期（每个周期24小时）中保持其活性，并且通过氧化再生完全恢复其活性。使用H2进行还原对催化剂性质的影响不同，VOx物种保持稳定而CrOx物种聚合。研究还强调了使用OMS支持相对于传统金属氧化物支持的优势，特别是在实现高烯烃选择性和长期稳定性方面。通过原位紫外/可见光谱和温度程序氧化分析揭示了催化剂失活的起源，表明在反应条件下，活性VOx物种的性质没有改变，与CrOx物种聚合的情况不同。
