Comparative study of propane dehydrogenation over V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts: Time on-stream behavior and origins of deactivation Abstract Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles.
Graphical abstract V- and Cr oxide-based catalysts with highly dispersed metal oxide species were prepared using MCM-41 as a support and tested in propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41 retained its activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles thanks to high stability of VOx species, whereas CrOx/MCM-41 gradually lost activity as aggregation of CrOx species occurred.
Highlights V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts were tested in non-oxidative C3H8 dehydrogenation (DH).  VOx/MCM-41 showed the lowest deactivation over four 24 h DH cycles.  Oxidative regeneration fully restored VOx/MCM-41 activity after each DH cycle.  The other two catalysts lost their activity from cycle to cycle.  VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was analyzed. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts showed superior time on-stream stability, retaining their activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles, due to the high stability of the VOx species. In contrast, the CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts gradually lost activity as the CrOx species aggregated. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts also lost their activity from cycle to cycle. The VOx species remained unchanged over four PDH cycles, while the CrOx species aggregated, explaining the differences in catalyst performance and deactivation. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts retained their initial activity and selectivity after oxidative regeneration, while the CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed gradual loss of activity.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能被分析。VOx/MCM-41催化剂显示出时间在流上稳定性，通过四个脱氢/氧化再生周期保持其活性，由于VOx物种的高稳定性。相比之下，CrOx/MCM-41催化剂逐渐失去活性，因为CrOx物种聚集。PtSn/Al2O3催化剂也从周期到周期失去了活性。VOx物种在四个PDH周期中保持不变，而CrOx物种聚集，解释了催化剂性能和失活的差异。在氧化再生后，VOx/MCM-41催化剂完全恢复了初始活性和选择性，而CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的活性逐渐下降。
