[6] "Contrarily, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 were transformed in the course of the DH experiment resulting in a gradual loss of the catalysts activity from cycle to cycle."

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, were found to be effective in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions without gas-phase oxygen. Achieved propane conversions were over 20% and propene selectivity exceeded 90% at 823 K, yielding an initial propene spacetime yield of .

2. Within a single PDH cycle, the deactivation of all catalysts was primarily attributed to the deposition of coke.

3. In situ UV/Vis analysis combined with Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO) of used catalysts helped in identifying factors that govern catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and across multiple PDH/regeneration cycles.

4. The VOx/MCM-41 catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability and recoverability, regaining its initial activity and selectivity fully upon oxidative regeneration. This is due to the unaltered nature of the highly dispersed active VOx species under the utilized reaction conditions and/or during regeneration.

5. Conversely, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 underwent structural transformations throughout the PDH experiment, leading to a progressive loss of catalyst activity from one cycle to the next.

1. OMS催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在没有气相氧的情况下对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应表现出有效性。在823 K时实现了超过20%的丙烷转化率和超过90%的丙烯选择性，初始丙烯时空产率为。

2. 在单个PDH周期内，所有催化剂的失活主要归因于焦炭沉积。

3. 就地紫外可见分析结合温度程序氧化（TPO）有助于识别单个PDH周期以及多个PDH/再生周期中催化剂失活的因素。

4.VOx/MCM-41催化剂展示了出色的稳定性和可恢复性，完全通过氧化再生恢复其初始活性和选择性。这是由于在使用条件下或再生期间未改变高度分散的活性VOx物种的性质。

5. 反过来，CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3物种在PDH实验过程中经历了结构变化，导致从一个周期到下一个周期催化剂活性的逐渐损失。
