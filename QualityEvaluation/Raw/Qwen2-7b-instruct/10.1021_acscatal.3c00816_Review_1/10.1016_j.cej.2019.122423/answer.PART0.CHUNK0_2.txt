Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, are analyzed for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts are compared to traditional metal oxide supports, highlighting their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms are discussed in detail. The presence of lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions are also considered.

MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts show differences in their structure and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The lattice oxygen species in these catalysts influence their activity and selectivity towards PDH reactions. H2 pretreatment is found to improve the stability and performance of these catalysts by reducing the formation of carbonaceous species and enhancing the interaction between metal oxide species and the support material.

The structural properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15, such as their ordered mesoporous structure, provide advantages in terms of accessibility of active sites and diffusion pathways for reactants and products. However, these structures also present limitations, such as restricted access to the interior of the pores and potential hindrance to the mobility of reaction intermediates.

Reaction mechanisms involving the interaction of metal oxide species with propane molecules, leading to the abstraction of hydrogen atoms and the formation of propylene, are discussed. The role of lattice oxygen in facilitating these reactions is emphasized, along with the importance of maintaining the stability of the metal oxide species during the PDH process.

The influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance is highlighted. H2 pretreatment can mitigate the deactivation caused by carbon deposition, thereby improving the longevity and efficiency of the catalysts in PDH reactions. The enhanced interaction between metal oxide species and the support material, facilitated by lattice oxygen, contributes to the stability and performance of these catalysts.

In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, exhibit specific advantages and limitations in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The presence of lattice oxygen species, the impact of H2 pretreatment, and the structural properties of these catalysts play crucial roles in determining their performance and deactivation behavior in PDH processes.
