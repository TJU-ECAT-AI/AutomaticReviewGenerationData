[1] "In the reaction period of more than 8h, the conversion of propane and selectivity of propylene remain nearly constant."
[2] "The addition of potassium also shows a significant effect on the catalytic performance."
[3] "The reduction or reaction process can strengthen the interaction between SnOx species and silica."
[4] "Besides, Pt represents the noble metal that has been extensively studied, but various non-noble metal oxides have been successfully developed, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. The structural properties and catalytic behavior are compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages include enhanced accessibility of active sites and faster diffusion of molecules in reactions due to the unique pore structure. Limitations might involve reduced surface area compared to traditional supports. Reaction mechanisms involve lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influencing catalyst performance and deactivation. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can either activate or deactivate the catalysts by altering the interaction between the metal oxides and the support, affecting the overall catalytic activity and stability in PDH reactions.
