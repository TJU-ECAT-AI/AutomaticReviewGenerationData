The Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, were analyzed in the context of Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Their structural properties and catalytic behavior were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports showed certain advantages such as high surface area, regular structure, relative high thermal stability, and weak acidity. However, their lattice oxygen species and the lack of effective interaction with the metal oxides limited their catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The VOx and CrOx species supported on these supports were prone to deactivation due to side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, which reduced their efficiency in converting propane to propylene.

In contrast, the Sn-based catalysts prepared using the DMSNs materials demonstrated superior catalytic performance and stability in PDH reactions. The SnOx species incorporated into the mesoporous silica support formed highly dispersed active sites that were less likely to reduce to metallic Sn at reaction temperatures, unlike the VOx and CrOx species on the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports. The DMSNs materials' 3D center-radial pore structure allowed for better accessibility of active sites and faster diffusion of reactant and product molecules, which improved the overall catalytic activity. Additionally, the molar ratio of NaSal/CTAB in the synthesis process influenced the catalyst's size, pore structure, and the strength of Sn-O-Si bonds, facilitating the generation of oxygen vacancies and Lewis acid sites that were advantageous for PDH reactions.

The absence of carbonaceous species formation on the Sn-DMSNs catalysts, as confirmed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy, indicated their enhanced stability and resistance to deactivation during PDH reactions. The reduction or reaction processes strengthened the interaction between SnOx species and the silica matrix, further contributing to the catalyst's stability. Moderate potassium (K) modification was found to reduce the surface acid sites and improve the selectivity of propylene production, offering an additional advantage over the traditional metal oxide-supported catalysts.

Overall, the Sn-based catalysts supported on the DMSNs materials exhibited a combination of advantages, including high stability, efficient use of Sn atoms, and the ability to resist coke formation, making them a promising alternative to traditional metal oxide-supported catalysts for PDH reactions. The lattice oxygen species and the interaction with the metal oxides played crucial roles in determining the catalytic behavior of the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports, whereas the DMSNs materials offered a more favorable microenvironment for the Sn-based catalysts, leading to improved performance in the PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是由MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中进行了分析。与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，它们的结构特性和催化行为进行了比较。MCM-41和SBA-15支持表现出一定的优势，如高表面积、规则结构、相对高的热稳定性以及较弱的酸性。然而，它们的晶格氧物种以及与金属氧化物的有效相互作用限制了它们在PDH反应中的催化性能。支持在这些支持上的VOx和CrOx物种容易因副反应（如氢解离和异构化）而被破坏，这降低了它们将丙烷转化为丙烯的效率。

相比之下，基于Sn的催化剂通过使用DMSNs材料显示出PDH反应中出色的催化性能和稳定性。嵌入到介孔二氧化硅支持中的SnOx物种形成了高度分散的活性位点，这些活性位点比MCM-41和SBA-15支持上的VOx和CrOx物种更不容易在反应温度下还原为金属Sn。DMSNs材料的三维中心放射状孔结构允许更好的活性位点可接近性和反应剂及产物分子的快速扩散，从而提高了整体催化活性。此外，合成过程中NaSal/CTAB的摩尔比影响催化剂的大小、孔结构和Sn-O-Si键的强度，有助于生成氧空位和路易斯酸位点，这对PDH反应有利。

通过原位拉曼光谱确认，DMSNs催化剂上没有形成碳质物种，表明它们具有增强的稳定性和对PDH反应期间的抗失活能力。减少或反应过程加强了SnOx物种与硅酸盐基矩阵之间的相互作用，进一步促进了催化剂的稳定性。适量钾（K）修饰降低了表面酸位点并提高了丙烯选择性，为传统金属氧化物支持催化剂提供了额外的优势。

总体而言，基于Sn的催化剂支持在DMSNs材料中表现出一系列优点，包括高稳定性、Sn原子的有效利用以及抵抗焦炭形成的能力，使它们成为PDH反应中传统金属氧化物支持催化剂的有前景的替代品。晶格氧物种及其与金属氧化物的相互作用在确定MCM-41和SBA-15支持的催化行为方面起着关键作用，而DMSNs材料提供了一个更适合Sn基催化剂的微环境，导致PDH反应中性能的改善。

<p>Platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts are the most widely used in commercial PDH processes to produce propylene and they have been extensively studied.</p>
<p>The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered to be the promising routes alternative to conventional cracking processes and has being the emerging technology used today.</p>
<p>Considered the request for green chemistry, the Cr-based catalysts gradually achieve less attention because of its toxicity.</p>
<p>Hence, much investigation has been devoted to the Pt-based catalysts, but the high cost, sintering of Pt and easy coke deposition are the major challenges.</p>
<p>Recently, Wang et al. reported that Sn-based silica catalysts exhibit comparable dehydrogenation performance to PtSn-based catalyst especially with excellent stability.</p>
<p>Further, Sn species were embedded into the hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), which improves the catalytic performance and dehydrogenation stability.</p>
<p>Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions.</p>
<p>Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts.</p>
<p>It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction.</p>
<p>Compared with the traditional impregnation method, the in-situ co-assembly method contributes to achieving a high concentration of active sites and anchoring the active sites into the framework of support.</p>
<p>The alkaline metals such as Li, Na and K are usually used as promoters, the effect of alkaline metals commonly involves acid-base interaction, adsorption/desorption behavior and the reducibility of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions over Pt-based catalysts, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization.</p>
<p>It can increase the dispersion of the active phase for Cr-based catalysts.</p>
<p>Thus, the addition of alkaline metal may be a good way to modify the properties of catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The effects of molar ratio of NaSal/CTAB and tin content on the structural and physicochemical properties of the Sn-DMSNs catalysts are investigated by means of a series of characterizations including SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, XPS, XRF, H2-TPR, FT-IR and in-situ Raman spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The Sn-DMSNs catalysts show excellent catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation and reactive stability.</p>
<p>Moreover, the structure of mesoporous silica also shows an important effect on the performance.</p>
<p>Compared with traditional Pt-based catalysts, Sn-based catalysts show long lifetime without discernible deactivation.</p>
<p>To further investigate the stability and regeneration properties of Sn-DMSNs catalysts, the 2.5Sn-DMSNs catalyst also is performed for three reaction-regeneration cycles continuously with each cycle of more than 8h.</p>

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, reveals several key points. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these materials differ significantly from traditional metal oxide supports. MCM-41 and SBA-15, while effective, often face limitations due to their pore size and shape, which can hinder reactant diffusion and product release. In contrast, Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (DMSNs) offer a unique central-radial pore structure, providing a large pore entrance and uniform nanoparticle size, which facilitates better accessibility of active sites and faster diffusion of reactants and products.

The in-situ co-assembly method used to synthesize Sn-DMSNs catalysts allows for a high concentration of active sites and their anchoring within the silica framework. This results in highly dispersed SnOx species, which serve as active sites for PDH reactions, showing that Sn alone can act as an active component, beyond just acting as a promoter. The Sn-DMSNs catalysts demonstrate excellent performance and stability in PDH reactions, surpassing traditional Pt-based catalysts in terms of dehydrogenation efficiency and longevity.

The molar ratio of NaSal/CTAB plays a crucial role in the synthesis process, affecting the size of the nanoparticles and pore entrance, thus impacting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The addition of alkaline metals like potassium modifies the catalyst properties by influencing acid-base interactions, adsorption/desorption behavior, and reducibility, leading to improved stability and selectivity for propylene production.

These findings highlight the potential of Sn-based catalysts as a viable alternative to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts in PDH processes, offering advantages in terms of cost, toxicity, and stability. The DMSNs materials, with their unique structural features, are expected to enable the preparation of novel Sn-containing DMSNs catalysts with superior catalytic performance for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

The research also underscores the importance of considering the lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Factors such as the strength of metal-oxygen-silica bonds, the presence of oxygen vacancies, and Lewis acid sites, which are more easily generated with higher NaSal/CTAB ratios, can influence the catalyst's activity and stability. H2 pretreatment can help mitigate deactivation by reducing the formation of carbonaceous species and enhancing the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation.

In summary, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts, with their optimized structure and unique properties, demonstrate superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The inclusion of alkaline metals and the careful tuning of synthesis parameters can further enhance the catalyst's efficiency and longevity, making them promising candidates for commercial PDH processes.

在合成Sn-DMSNs催化剂时使用原位共组装方法，能够实现高浓度的活性位点及其在二氧化硅框架内的锚定。这导致高度分散的SnOx物种作为活性位点参与PDH反应，显示Sn本身可以作为活性成分发挥作用，而不仅仅是促进剂。Sn-DMSNs催化剂在PDH反应中表现出出色的表现和稳定性，其效率和长寿命超过了传统的Pt基催化剂。

NaSal/CTAB的摩尔比在合成过程中起着至关重要的作用，影响纳米粒子的大小和孔径入口，从而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。碱金属如钾的添加通过影响酸-碱相互作用、吸附/脱附行为和可还原性来修改催化剂性质，进而提高稳定性和丙烯产率。

这些发现强调了Sn基催化剂作为PDH过程Pt-和Cr基催化剂的可行替代品的潜力，提供了成本、毒性以及稳定性的优势。DMSNs材料凭借其独特的结构特征，有望用于制备具有优越催化性能的新型Sn含DMSNs催化剂，直接将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。

研究还强调了考虑晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响的重要性。因素如金属-氧-硅键的强度、氧空位的存在以及更易于生成的Lewis酸位点，可以通过调整合成参数来影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。H2预处理有助于减少碳沉积物种的形成并增强催化剂抵抗焦炭形成的能力，从而提高其使用寿命。

综上所述，Sn-DMSNs催化剂凭借其优化的结构和独特性质，在PDH反应中表现出优于传统金属氧化物支持的性能。通过添加碱金属和精确调整治炼参数，可以进一步提高催化剂的效率和长寿命，使它们成为商业PDH过程有前景的选择。
