The Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, were analyzed in the context of Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Their structural properties and catalytic behavior were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports showed certain advantages such as high surface area, regular structure, relative high thermal stability, and weak acidity. However, their lattice oxygen species and the lack of effective interaction with the metal oxides limited their catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The VOx and CrOx species supported on these supports were prone to deactivation due to side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, which reduced their efficiency in converting propane to propylene.

In contrast, the Sn-based catalysts prepared using the DMSNs materials demonstrated superior catalytic performance and stability in PDH reactions. The SnOx species incorporated into the mesoporous silica support formed highly dispersed active sites that were less likely to reduce to metallic Sn at reaction temperatures, unlike the VOx and CrOx species on the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports. The DMSNs materials' 3D center-radial pore structure allowed for better accessibility of active sites and faster diffusion of reactant and product molecules, which improved the overall catalytic activity. Additionally, the molar ratio of NaSal/CTAB in the synthesis process influenced the catalyst's size, pore structure, and the strength of Sn-O-Si bonds, facilitating the generation of oxygen vacancies and Lewis acid sites that were advantageous for PDH reactions.

The absence of carbonaceous species formation on the Sn-DMSNs catalysts, as confirmed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy, indicated their enhanced stability and resistance to deactivation during PDH reactions. The reduction or reaction processes strengthened the interaction between SnOx species and the silica matrix, further contributing to the catalyst's stability. Moderate potassium (K) modification was found to reduce the surface acid sites and improve the selectivity of propylene production, offering an additional advantage over the traditional metal oxide-supported catalysts.

Overall, the Sn-based catalysts supported on the DMSNs materials exhibited a combination of advantages, including high stability, efficient use of Sn atoms, and the ability to resist coke formation, making them a promising alternative to traditional metal oxide-supported catalysts for PDH reactions. The lattice oxygen species and the interaction with the metal oxides played crucial roles in determining the catalytic behavior of the MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports, whereas the DMSNs materials offered a more favorable microenvironment for the Sn-based catalysts, leading to improved performance in the PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是由MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中进行了分析。与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，它们的结构特性和催化行为进行了比较。MCM-41和SBA-15支持表现出一定的优势，如高表面积、规则结构、相对高的热稳定性以及较弱的酸性。然而，它们的晶格氧物种以及与金属氧化物的有效相互作用限制了它们在PDH反应中的催化性能。支持在这些支持上的VOx和CrOx物种容易因副反应（如氢解离和异构化）而被破坏，这降低了它们将丙烷转化为丙烯的效率。

相比之下，基于Sn的催化剂通过使用DMSNs材料显示出PDH反应中出色的催化性能和稳定性。嵌入到介孔二氧化硅支持中的SnOx物种形成了高度分散的活性位点，这些活性位点比MCM-41和SBA-15支持上的VOx和CrOx物种更不容易在反应温度下还原为金属Sn。DMSNs材料的三维中心放射状孔结构允许更好的活性位点可接近性和反应剂及产物分子的快速扩散，从而提高了整体催化活性。此外，合成过程中NaSal/CTAB的摩尔比影响催化剂的大小、孔结构和Sn-O-Si键的强度，有助于生成氧空位和路易斯酸位点，这对PDH反应有利。

通过原位拉曼光谱确认，DMSNs催化剂上没有形成碳质物种，表明它们具有增强的稳定性和对PDH反应期间的抗失活能力。减少或反应过程加强了SnOx物种与硅酸盐基矩阵之间的相互作用，进一步促进了催化剂的稳定性。适量钾（K）修饰降低了表面酸位点并提高了丙烯选择性，为传统金属氧化物支持催化剂提供了额外的优势。

总体而言，基于Sn的催化剂支持在DMSNs材料中表现出一系列优点，包括高稳定性、Sn原子的有效利用以及抵抗焦炭形成的能力，使它们成为PDH反应中传统金属氧化物支持催化剂的有前景的替代品。晶格氧物种及其与金属氧化物的相互作用在确定MCM-41和SBA-15支持的催化行为方面起着关键作用，而DMSNs材料提供了一个更适合Sn基催化剂的微环境，导致PDH反应中性能的改善。
