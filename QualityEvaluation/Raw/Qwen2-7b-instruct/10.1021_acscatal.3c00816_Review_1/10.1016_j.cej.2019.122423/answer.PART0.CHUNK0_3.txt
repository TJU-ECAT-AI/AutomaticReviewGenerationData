[1] "Sn-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Sn-DMSNs) were successfully prepared by the in-situ co-assembly method. Sn-DMSNs preserve original structural characteristics with three-dimensional and center-radial pore structure."
[2] "The Sn-DMSNs catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and stability in the propane dehydrogenation. The highly dispersed SnOx species rather than polymeric SnOx or crystalline SnO2 species contribute to the activation of propane and formation of propylene."
[3] "The reduction or reaction process can strengthen the interaction between SnOx species and silica. The excellent stability of Sn-DMSNs catalysts can be ascribed to the good ability to restrain coke formation and strong interaction between SnOx species and silica in the PDH process."
[4] "Compared with traditional Pt-based PDH catalysts, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts show a long lifetime without discernible deactivation."

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, were analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts showed distinct structural properties and catalytic behaviors. VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 exhibited lattice oxygen species and high surface areas, facilitating the activation of propane and the formation of propylene. However, the performance of these catalysts was limited by the ease of coke formation, leading to deactivation during PDH reactions. 

In contrast, Sn-DMSNs catalysts demonstrated excellent catalytic performance and stability in PDH reactions. The SnOx species were highly dispersed, contributing to the activation of propane and the formation of propylene without undergoing reduction to metallic Sn. The Sn-DMSNs catalysts showed a remarkable ability to restrain carbonaceous species formation, offering a longer lifetime without discernible deactivation compared to traditional Pt-based PDH catalysts.

Factors influencing catalyst performance included lattice oxygen species, which facilitated the activation of propane and propylene formation. H2 pretreatment helped in enhancing the dispersion of metal oxides, thereby improving catalytic activity. However, the presence of lattice oxygen species and the risk of coke formation posed limitations to the overall performance of VOx and CrOx supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 in PDH reactions.

金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中进行了分析。这些催化剂显示出了独特的结构特性和催化行为。MCM-41和SBA-15上的VOx和CrOx表现出晶格氧物种和高比表面积，有利于丙烷的激活和丙烯的形成。然而，这些催化剂的性能受限于焦炭形成的风险，导致PDH反应中的催化剂失活。

相比之下，Sn-DMSNs催化剂在PDH反应中表现出卓越的催化性能和稳定性。SnOx物种高度分散，有助于丙烷的激活和丙烯的形成，而无需还原为金属Sn。Sn-DMSNs催化剂显示出出色的抑制焦炭生成的能力，其使用寿命远超传统铂基PDH催化剂，并且没有明显的失活现象。

影响催化剂性能的因素包括晶格氧物种，它促进了丙烷和丙烯形成的激活。H2预处理有助于提高金属氧化物的分散性，从而改善催化活性。然而，晶格氧物种的存在和焦炭生成的风险限制了MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx在PDH反应中的整体性能。
