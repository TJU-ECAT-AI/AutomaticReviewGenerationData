<p>Platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts are the most widely used in commercial PDH processes to produce propylene and they have been extensively studied.</p>
<p>The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered to be the promising routes alternative to conventional cracking processes and has being the emerging technology used today.</p>
<p>Considered the request for green chemistry, the Cr-based catalysts gradually achieve less attention because of its toxicity.</p>
<p>Hence, much investigation has been devoted to the Pt-based catalysts, but the high cost, sintering of Pt and easy coke deposition are the major challenges.</p>
<p>Recently, Wang et al. reported that Sn-based silica catalysts exhibit comparable dehydrogenation performance to PtSn-based catalyst especially with excellent stability.</p>
<p>Further, Sn species were embedded into the hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), which improves the catalytic performance and dehydrogenation stability.</p>
<p>Mesoporous silica is one of the most commonly used as the support for synthesizing catalysts for PDH reactions.</p>
<p>Recently, the novel dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with unique central-radial pore structures is expected to be a potential support for preparing catalysts.</p>
<p>It is superior to common mesoporous silica such as HMS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 due to the large pore entrance and uniform monodispersed nanoparticle structure, which is not easy to be blocked and has good accessibility of active sites and fast diffusion of the reactant and product molecules in the large interconnected mesopores during reaction.</p>
<p>Compared with the traditional impregnation method, the in-situ co-assembly method contributes to achieving a high concentration of active sites and anchoring the active sites into the framework of support.</p>
<p>The alkaline metals such as Li, Na and K are usually used as promoters, the effect of alkaline metals commonly involves acid-base interaction, adsorption/desorption behavior and the reducibility of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions over Pt-based catalysts, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization.</p>
<p>It can increase the dispersion of the active phase for Cr-based catalysts.</p>
<p>Thus, the addition of alkaline metal may be a good way to modify the properties of catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The effects of molar ratio of NaSal/CTAB and tin content on the structural and physicochemical properties of the Sn-DMSNs catalysts are investigated by means of a series of characterizations including SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, XPS, XRF, H2-TPR, FT-IR and in-situ Raman spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The Sn-DMSNs catalysts show excellent catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation and reactive stability.</p>
<p>Moreover, the structure of mesoporous silica also shows an important effect on the performance.</p>
<p>Compared with traditional Pt-based catalysts, Sn-based catalysts show long lifetime without discernible deactivation.</p>
<p>To further investigate the stability and regeneration properties of Sn-DMSNs catalysts, the 2.5Sn-DMSNs catalyst also is performed for three reaction-regeneration cycles continuously with each cycle of more than 8h.</p>
<p>The catalyst almost preserves original propane conversion and selectivities of propylene and ethylene after each reaction-regeneration cycle with oxygen treatment.</p>

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, reveals several key points. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these materials differ significantly from traditional metal oxide supports. MCM-41 and SBA-15, while effective, often face limitations due to their pore size and shape, which can hinder reactant diffusion and product release. In contrast, Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (DMSNs) offer a unique central-radial pore structure, providing a large pore entrance and uniform nanoparticle size, which facilitates better accessibility of active sites and faster diffusion of reactants and products.

The in-situ co-assembly method used to synthesize Sn-DMSNs catalysts allows for a high concentration of active sites and their anchoring within the silica framework. This results in highly dispersed SnOx species, which serve as active sites for PDH reactions, showing that Sn alone can act as an active component, beyond just acting as a promoter. The Sn-DMSNs catalysts demonstrate excellent performance and stability in PDH reactions, surpassing traditional Pt-based catalysts in terms of dehydrogenation efficiency and longevity.

The molar ratio of NaSal/CTAB plays a crucial role in the synthesis process, affecting the size of the nanoparticles and pore entrance, thus impacting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The addition of alkaline metals like potassium modifies the catalyst properties by influencing acid-base interactions, adsorption/desorption behavior, and reducibility, leading to improved stability and selectivity for propylene production.

These findings highlight the potential of Sn-based catalysts as a viable alternative to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts in PDH processes, offering advantages in terms of cost, toxicity, and stability. The DMSNs materials, with their unique structural features, are expected to enable the preparation of novel Sn-containing DMSNs catalysts with superior catalytic performance for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

The research also underscores the importance of considering the lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Factors such as the strength of metal-oxygen-silica bonds, the presence of oxygen vacancies, and Lewis acid sites, which are more easily generated with higher NaSal/CTAB ratios, can influence the catalyst's activity and stability. H2 pretreatment can help mitigate deactivation by reducing the formation of carbonaceous species and enhancing the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation.

In summary, the Sn-DMSNs catalysts, with their optimized structure and unique properties, demonstrate superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The inclusion of alkaline metals and the careful tuning of synthesis parameters can further enhance the catalyst's efficiency and longevity, making them promising candidates for commercial PDH processes.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，揭示了这些材料与传统金属氧化物支持在结构特性和催化行为上的几个关键点。与MCM-41和SBA-15相比，它们经常面临由于孔径大小和形状限制，导致反应物扩散和产物释放受阻的问题。相比之下，Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles（DMSNs）提供了一种独特的中央放射状孔结构，具有大的孔入口和均匀的纳米粒子尺寸，这有助于提高活性位点的可接近性，并加快反应物和产物的扩散。

在合成Sn-DMSNs催化剂时使用原位共组装方法，能够实现高浓度的活性位点及其在二氧化硅框架内的锚定。这导致高度分散的SnOx物种作为活性位点参与PDH反应，显示Sn本身可以作为活性成分发挥作用，而不仅仅是促进剂。Sn-DMSNs催化剂在PDH反应中表现出出色的表现和稳定性，其效率和长寿命超过了传统的Pt基催化剂。

NaSal/CTAB的摩尔比在合成过程中起着至关重要的作用，影响纳米粒子的大小和孔径入口，从而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。碱金属如钾的添加通过影响酸-碱相互作用、吸附/脱附行为和可还原性来修改催化剂性质，进而提高稳定性和丙烯产率。

这些发现强调了Sn基催化剂作为PDH过程Pt-和Cr基催化剂的可行替代品的潜力，提供了成本、毒性以及稳定性的优势。DMSNs材料凭借其独特的结构特征，有望用于制备具有优越催化性能的新型Sn含DMSNs催化剂，直接将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。

研究还强调了考虑晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的影响的重要性。因素如金属-氧-硅键的强度、氧空位的存在以及更易于生成的Lewis酸位点，可以通过调整合成参数来影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。H2预处理有助于减少碳沉积物种的形成并增强催化剂抵抗焦炭形成的能力，从而提高其使用寿命。

综上所述，Sn-DMSNs催化剂凭借其优化的结构和独特性质，在PDH反应中表现出优于传统金属氧化物支持的性能。通过添加碱金属和精确调整治炼参数，可以进一步提高催化剂的效率和长寿命，使它们成为商业PDH过程有前景的选择。
