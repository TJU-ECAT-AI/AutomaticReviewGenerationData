[1] "Vanadia catalysts supported on MCM-41 and HMS mesoporous silicas showed the best catalytic performance compared to other mesoporous silicas (SBA-15, MCF), mircroporous silicalite and non-porous SiO2 supported vanadia catalysts in the ODH of propane."
[2] "The highest propene yields (1619%) were accomplished at relatively low V loadings (24 wt.% V)."
[3] "The differences in propane TOFs were marginal among the mesoporous supported catalysts implying that the mesopore structure and size has a limited direct effect on catalyst's intrinsic activity."
[4] "However, a superior performance of the catalyst supported on HMS mesoporous silica with 3-D wormhole pore structure and medium mesopore size (2.72.8 nm) in combination with high textural porosity (interparticle voids) could be identified."
[5] "The slightly lower activity of the catalysts supported on SBA-15 and MCF mesoporous silicas was attributed to the partial destruction of the mesopore structure during preparation of the catalysts, thus leading to relatively lower vanadia dispersion and also to the formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to the active VOx phases inside the pores."
[6] "The presence of strong acid sites on the surface of microporous zeolite silicalite induced high propane conversion with the respective supported vanadia catalysts but at the same time gave rise to direct oxidation of propane towards CO2 and cracking reactions."
[7] "On the other hand, the non-porous SiO2 supported catalysts were not active mainly due to their low surface area and consequently the poor vanadia dispersion but were quite selective towards propene since they operated at low conversions even for relatively high reaction temperatures."

1. Vanadia catalysts supported on MCM-41 and HMS mesoporous silicas demonstrated superior performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to catalysts on other materials.
2. The highest propene yields were achieved at lower vanadium loadings (24 wt.%).
3. The mesopore structure and size had a limited direct impact on catalyst activity.
4. The catalyst supported on HMS mesoporous silica with specific pore characteristics showed exceptional performance.
5. The lower activity of catalysts on SBA-15 and MCF was due to partial destruction of the mesopore structure, leading to reduced vanadium dispersion and access blockage.
6. The presence of strong acid sites on silicalite catalysts led to high propane conversion but also promoted oxidation and cracking reactions.
7. Non-porous SiO2 catalysts were less active due to their low surface area but showed high selectivity for propene production.

1. 支撑在MCM-41和HMS微孔硅上的钒催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能最佳，与其他材料相比。
2. 在较低的钒负载量（24 wt.%）下，可以获得最高的丙烯产率。
3. 微孔结构和尺寸对催化剂活性的影响有限。
4. 具有特定孔特性的HMS微孔硅基催化剂表现出卓越的性能。
5. SBA-15和MCF上的催化剂活性较低的原因是部分破坏了微孔结构，导致了钒分散度降低以及活性位点访问受阻。
6. 硅酸盐催化剂表面的强酸性位点导致了高丙烷转化率，但也促进了氧化和裂解反应。
7. 非孔性SiO2催化剂的活性较低，主要是由于其低表面积，但显示出高丙烯选择性生产。
