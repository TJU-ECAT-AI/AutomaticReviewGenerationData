1. HMS and MCM-41 catalysts show high vanadia dispersion, with only isolated monovanadates detected up to 8 wt.% vanadium loading. Higher V loadings reveal traces of bulk V2O5 nanoparticles.
2. For V loadings up to 8 wt.%, HMS and MCM-41 catalysts predominantly exhibit isolated monovanadates on their surfaces, indicating high dispersion of vanadia species.
3. Strong acid sites on zeolite silicalite catalysts induce high propane conversion, but lead to direct oxidation to CO2 and cracking reactions.
4. The mesopore structure and size of the catalysts have a limited direct impact on intrinsic activity, as indicated by marginal differences in propane turnover frequencies (TOFs) among the mesoporous supported catalysts.

1.HMS和MCM-41催化剂显示出高钒分布，直到8 wt.%钒负载，仅检测到孤立的单钒酸盐。更高负载量揭示了块状V2O5纳米粒子的存在。
2.对于高达8 wt.%的钒负载，HMS和MCM-41催化剂表面主要表现为孤立的单钒酸盐，表明了钒物种的高度分散。
3.在沸石硅铝酸盐催化剂上，强酸性位点导致高丙烷转化率，但同时引发丙烷直接氧化为CO2和裂解反应。
4.多孔结构和大小对催化剂的内在活性影响有限，因为多孔支持催化剂之间的丙烷转化频率（TOF）存在微小差异。
