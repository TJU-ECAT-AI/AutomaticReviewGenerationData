<p>The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion.</p>
<p>In the case of the catalyst with the highest V loading (8VHMS2 with ns = 1.33 V/nm2) a small peak at 997 cm1 indicates the existence of traces of bulk V2O5 nanoparticles.</p>
<p>For catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 (with VOx surface densities, ns, in the range of 0.091.33 V/nm2) the predominant surface V species appear to be the isolated monovanadates with one terminal VO (observed at 10381040 cm1).</p>
<p>The presence of strong acid sites on the surface of microporous zeolite silicalite induced high propane conversion with the respective supported vanadia catalysts but at the same time gave rise to direct oxidation of propane towards CO2 and cracking reactions.</p>
<p>The differences in propane TOFs were marginal among the mesoporous supported catalysts implying that the mesopore structure and size has a limited direct effect on catalyst's intrinsic activity.</p>

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx, showed superior performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials demonstrated high vanadia dispersion, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity towards propene production. 

2. The presence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influenced catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen facilitated the activation of propane, while H2 pretreatment helped maintain catalyst stability and efficiency.

3. MCM-41 and HMS supported catalysts exhibited the best performance, achieving high propane conversions and propene selectivities. The high dispersion of vanadia species on these supports enabled efficient dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The partial destruction of the mesopore structure during catalyst preparation for SBA-15 and MCF materials led to reduced vanadia dispersion, affecting their catalytic activity negatively. However, these catalysts remained selective towards propene production even at low conversions.

5. Combining framework mesoporosity with textural porosity in the HMS silica supported catalysts led to the highest propene yields, reaching up to 19%. This structure allowed for improved access of reactants and products to the active sites, enhancing overall catalytic performance.

<p>The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCF, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated.</p>
<p>High surface area mesoporous silica supports, such as M41S, HMS, SBA-15, and MCF, have shown promising catalytic performance in the ODH of propane mainly due to the high degree of vanadia dispersion.</p>
<p>The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion.</p>

<p>No features due to V isolated species are observed for these samples. The absence of monomeric species particularly in the case of silicalite can be ascribed to the acid character of the support which favors agglomeration of VOx units to form V2O5 crystals.</p>
<p>The TPR profiles for all the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas show a maximum of hydrogen consumption at about 540570 C (Table 2).</p>
<p>When comparing catalysts with the same V loading (4 wt.%) on different mesoporous supports, the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts showed a slightly higher number of acid sites compared to the respective MCM-41 and HMS supported catalysts.</p>
<p>The amount of acid sites of the pure silicalite sample was determined about 0.11 mmol NH3/g.</p>
<p>It can thus be suggested that the monomeric vanadia species formed on the surface of mesoporous silicas are much more acidic compared to the bulk crystalline vanadia supported on the silicalite sample.</p>

<p>The TPR profiles for all the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas show a maximum of hydrogen consumption at about 540570 C ( Table 2 ) which is mainly attributed to the reduction of monomeric VOx (V5+) surface species.</p>
<p>The acidic characteristics of the supported vanadia catalysts were studied by NH3-TPD. The TPD curves are shown in Fig. 3 and the total number of acid sites for the measured catalysts are given in Table 2 .</p>
<p>All the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas show one relatively sharp desorption peak at around 200210 C related to weak Lewis acid sites which are attributed to isolated vanadium sites tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen.</p>
<p>As it can be seen from the data in Table 2 , the presence of bulk crystalline vanadia on the 4 wt.% V silicalite catalyst has a minor effect on the acidity of pure silicalite.</p>
<p>The propane conversion for the 4 wt.% V catalysts supported on mesoporous MCM-41, HMS, SBA-15, MCF, microporous zeolite silicalite and non-porous SiO2 versus reaction temperature is shown in Fig. 4 a.</p>
<p>Except for the non-porous SiO2, all the other supported vanadia catalysts show high propane conversions approaching 3540% at reaction temperature of 550575 C.</p>
<p>The selectivity to propene obtained at various temperatures as a function of conversion is presented in Fig. 4 b.</p>
<p>There is, however, an indirect effect that is related with the partial breakdown of the structure of SBA-15 and MCF during preparation of the vanadia catalysts, which resulted in lower vanadia dispersion and also to the formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to the active VOx phases inside the pores.</p>
<p>However, the above results cannot be used to gain an insight into the intrinsic rate of products formation. Turnover rates of propane consumption for the catalysts supported on high surface area mesoporous silicas with highly dispersed VOx species were calculated based on the experimental results obtained at 500 C for conversion values below ca. <10%.</p>
<p>Evaluating the overall catalytic performance in propane ODH in terms of propene yield, based on the activity/selectivity results ( Fig. 4 , Fig. 5 ) we propose as the most promising catalytic samples those supported on HMS-2 mesoporous silica which possess medium mesopore sizes of 2.72.8 nm (compared to the other mesoporous silicas) and additional textural porosity as high as 0.6 cm3/g.</p>
<p>Propane conversion and propene selectivity as a function of TOS for both materials are compiled in Fig. 7 . The unchanged profiles of propane conversion and propene selectivity demonstrate the superior stability of the mesoporous supported vanadia catalysts, implying that the mesoporous supports retain their structure and the high vanadia dispersion under reaction conditions for extended period of time.</p>
