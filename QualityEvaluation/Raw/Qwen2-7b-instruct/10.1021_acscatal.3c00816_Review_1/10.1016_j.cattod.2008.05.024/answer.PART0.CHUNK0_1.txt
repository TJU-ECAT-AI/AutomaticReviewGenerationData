1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx, showed superior performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional metal oxide supports. These materials demonstrated high vanadia dispersion, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity towards propene production. 

2. The presence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influenced catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen facilitated the activation of propane, while H2 pretreatment helped maintain catalyst stability and efficiency.

3. MCM-41 and HMS supported catalysts exhibited the best performance, achieving high propane conversions and propene selectivities. The high dispersion of vanadia species on these supports enabled efficient dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The partial destruction of the mesopore structure during catalyst preparation for SBA-15 and MCF materials led to reduced vanadia dispersion, affecting their catalytic activity negatively. However, these catalysts remained selective towards propene production even at low conversions.

5. Combining framework mesoporosity with textural porosity in the HMS silica supported catalysts led to the highest propene yields, reaching up to 19%. This structure allowed for improved access of reactants and products to the active sites, enhancing overall catalytic performance.

1. 金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx，在丙烷裂解（PDH）反应中的性能优于传统金属氧化物支持材料。这些材料表现出高钒分散性，提高了催化活性和丙烯选择性。

2. 晶格氧物种和H2预处理显著影响了PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活。晶格氧促进了丙烷的激活，而H2预处理有助于保持催化剂的稳定性和效率。

3.MCM-41和HMS支持的催化剂表现出最佳性能，实现了高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这些支持物上高分散的钒物种使得有效的脱氢反应得以进行。

4.SBA-15和MCF材料在部分破坏了其微孔结构后，导致了分散的降低，从而影响了它们的催化活性。然而，这些催化剂即使在低转化率下也能保持对丙烯的高选择性生产。

5. 结合框架微孔性和纹理孔性的HMS硅支持催化剂实现了最高的丙烯产率，高达19%。这种结构允许更好地接近活性位点，从而增强整体催化性能。
