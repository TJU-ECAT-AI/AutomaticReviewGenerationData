<p>The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCF, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated.</p>
<p>High surface area mesoporous silica supports, such as M41S, HMS, SBA-15, and MCF, have shown promising catalytic performance in the ODH of propane mainly due to the high degree of vanadia dispersion.</p>
<p>The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion.</p>
<p>In the case of SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts, additional bands ascribed to V2O5 nanoparticles were evidenced while these bands were the only ones identified on the surface of the catalysts supported on silicalite and non-porous silica.</p>
<p>The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%).</p>
<p>The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion.</p>
<p>The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%).</p>
<p>The highest propene yield (up to 19%) and stable catalytic behavior was attained for catalysts supported on HMS mesoporous silica, and especially for those combining framework mesoporosity and textural porosity (voids between primary nanoparticles).</p>
<p>In the case of silicalite and SiO2 based catalysts shown in Fig. 1 b (with ns of 0.8 and 32.8 V/nm2), the only bands detected are due to bulk V2O5 (997, 696, 522, 409, 282 cm1).</p>
<p>No features due to V isolated species are observed for these samples. The absence of monomeric species particularly in the case of silicalite can be ascribed to the acid character of the support which favors agglomeration of VOx units to form V2O5 crystals.</p>
<p>The TPR profiles for all the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas show a maximum of hydrogen consumption at about 540570 C (Table 2).</p>
<p>When comparing catalysts with the same V loading (4 wt.%) on different mesoporous supports, the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts showed a slightly higher number of acid sites compared to the respective MCM-41 and HMS supported catalysts.</p>
<p>The amount of acid sites of the pure silicalite sample was determined about 0.11 mmol NH3/g.</p>
<p>It can thus be suggested that the monomeric vanadia species formed on the surface of mesoporous silicas are much more acidic compared to the bulk crystalline vanadia supported on the silicalite sample.</p>
<p>The presence of strong acid sites on the surface of microporous zeolite silicalite induced high propane conversion with the respective supported vanadia catalysts but at the same time gave rise to direct oxidation of propane towards CO2 and cracking reactions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the non-porous SiO2 supported catalysts were not active mainly due to their low surface area and consequently the poor vanadia dispersion but were quite selective towards propene since they operated at low conversions even for relatively high reaction temperatures.</p>

1. Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx, show promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials have high degree of vanadia dispersion due to their high surface area. 

2. The structural properties of MCM-41 and HMS catalysts allow for high dispersion of vanadia species, leading to better catalytic performance. SBA-15 and MCF catalysts, despite having larger mesopore sizes, exhibit lower dispersion due to partial destruction of the mesopore structure during preparation.

3. Catalysts supported on HMS and MCM-41 materials perform best in PDH reactions, achieving high propane conversions and propene selectivities. 

4. Microporous zeolite silicalite introduces strong acid sites that promote high propane conversion but also favor direct oxidation and cracking reactions, leading to overoxidation of propene.

5. Non-porous silica supports lack activity due to low surface area and vanadia dispersion, but exhibit high selectivity towards propene production.

6. Lattice oxygen species and hydrogen treatment affect catalyst performance by influencing vanadia speciation and dispersion, impacting reaction mechanisms.

7. Framework mesoporosity and textural porosity of HMS silica combined with medium mesopore size contribute to high propene yield and stable behavior.

8. Factors like lattice oxygen species, hydrogen pretreatment, and the presence of strong acid sites on zeolite surfaces play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance in PDH reactions.
