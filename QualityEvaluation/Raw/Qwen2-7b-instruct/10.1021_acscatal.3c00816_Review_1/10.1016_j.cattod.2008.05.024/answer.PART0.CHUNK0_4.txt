<p>The structural characteristics and the performance of vanadia catalysts (0.78 wt.% V) supported on mesoporous (MCM-41, HMS, MCF, SBA-15), microporous (silicalite) and non-porous (SiO2) silicas in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were investigated.</p>
<p>The only vanadia species detected on the surface of HMS and MCM-41 for V loadings up to 8 wt.% were isolated monovanadates indicating high vanadia dispersion.</p>
<p>Lower activity due to the lower degree of vanadia dispersion, caused by the partial destruction of the pore structure was observed for the SBA-15 and MCF supported catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalysts supported on mesoporous HMS and MCM-41 materials showed the best performance achieving high propane conversions (3540%) with relatively high propene selectivities (3547%).</p>
<p>The highest propene yield (up to 19%) and stable catalytic behavior was attained for catalysts supported on HMS mesoporous silica, and especially for those combining framework mesoporosity and textural porosity (voids between primary nanoparticles).</p>
<p>In the case of silicalite and SiO2 based catalysts shown in Fig. 1 b (with ns of 0.8 and 32.8 V/nm2), the only bands detected are due to bulk V2O5 (997, 696, 522, 409, 282 cm1).</p>
<p>No features due to V isolated species are observed for these samples. The absence of monomeric species particularly in the case of silicalite can be ascribed to the acid character of the support which favors agglomeration of VOx units to form V2O5 crystals.</p>
<p>The TPR profiles for all the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas show a maximum of hydrogen consumption at about 540570 C ( Table 2 ) which is mainly attributed to the reduction of monomeric VOx (V5+) surface species.</p>
<p>The acidic characteristics of the supported vanadia catalysts were studied by NH3-TPD. The TPD curves are shown in Fig. 3 and the total number of acid sites for the measured catalysts are given in Table 2 .</p>
<p>All the catalysts supported on mesoporous silicas show one relatively sharp desorption peak at around 200210 C related to weak Lewis acid sites which are attributed to isolated vanadium sites tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen.</p>
<p>As it can be seen from the data in Table 2 , the presence of bulk crystalline vanadia on the 4 wt.% V silicalite catalyst has a minor effect on the acidity of pure silicalite.</p>
<p>The propane conversion for the 4 wt.% V catalysts supported on mesoporous MCM-41, HMS, SBA-15, MCF, microporous zeolite silicalite and non-porous SiO2 versus reaction temperature is shown in Fig. 4 a.</p>
<p>Except for the non-porous SiO2, all the other supported vanadia catalysts show high propane conversions approaching 3540% at reaction temperature of 550575 C.</p>
<p>The selectivity to propene obtained at various temperatures as a function of conversion is presented in Fig. 4 b.</p>
<p>There is, however, an indirect effect that is related with the partial breakdown of the structure of SBA-15 and MCF during preparation of the vanadia catalysts, which resulted in lower vanadia dispersion and also to the formation of non-skeletal silica phases that blocked access to the active VOx phases inside the pores.</p>
<p>However, the above results cannot be used to gain an insight into the intrinsic rate of products formation. Turnover rates of propane consumption for the catalysts supported on high surface area mesoporous silicas with highly dispersed VOx species were calculated based on the experimental results obtained at 500 C for conversion values below ca. <10%.</p>
<p>Evaluating the overall catalytic performance in propane ODH in terms of propene yield, based on the activity/selectivity results ( Fig. 4 , Fig. 5 ) we propose as the most promising catalytic samples those supported on HMS-2 mesoporous silica which possess medium mesopore sizes of 2.72.8 nm (compared to the other mesoporous silicas) and additional textural porosity as high as 0.6 cm3/g.</p>
<p>Propane conversion and propene selectivity as a function of TOS for both materials are compiled in Fig. 7 . The unchanged profiles of propane conversion and propene selectivity demonstrate the superior stability of the mesoporous supported vanadia catalysts, implying that the mesoporous supports retain their structure and the high vanadia dispersion under reaction conditions for extended period of time.</p>

1. MCM-41 and HMS catalysts supported vanadia showed the best performance in PDH reactions due to high vanadia dispersion.
2. SBA-15 and MCF catalysts had lower activity due to partial destruction of the pore structure causing lower vanadia dispersion.
3. HMS mesoporous silica combined with textural porosity offered superior performance in PDH reactions.
4. Silicalite catalysts favored direct oxidation of propane towards CO2 and cracking reactions due to strong acid sites.
5. Non-porous SiO2 catalysts were not active due to low surface area and poor vanadia dispersion but were selective towards propene.
6. Factors like lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influenced catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
