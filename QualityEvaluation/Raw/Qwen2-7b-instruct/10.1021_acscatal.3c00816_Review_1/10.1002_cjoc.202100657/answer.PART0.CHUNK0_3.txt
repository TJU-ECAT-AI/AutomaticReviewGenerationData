<p>Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods. Shale gas revolution results in low price of ethane, making the production of ethene from ethane economically competitive.</p>

<p>Outstanding initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity of ca. 99% were achieved for the optimal PtSn/ZrM, which is more coking-tolerant and stable by generating graphitic carbon mainly on support instead of active metals.</p>

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed in the provided literature. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these OMS supports are compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The literature highlights that lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Advantages of using OMS catalysts include their ordered mesoporous structure, which promotes better dispersion of metal species and facilitates more efficient reactions. The incorporation of Zr species into the MCM-41 framework results in a catalyst (PtSn/ZrM) that exhibits outstanding initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity of approximately 99%. This catalyst is more coking-tolerant and stable due to the generation of graphitic carbon on the support rather than on the active metal sites.

Limitations of using acidic supports are discussed, as they can induce carbon deposition under high operation temperatures, leading to deactivation through the coverage of active sites. The literature suggests that modulation of Zr species on a non-acidic support can lead to the development of highly dispersed and stable PtSn catalysts, decreasing acidity, and preventing rapid deactivation.

The literature also proposes that the incorporation of moderate heteroatoms into the framework of mesoporous materials, such as Ti and V, can enhance alkane dehydrogenation performance, offering alternative strategies for achieving better catalyst performance.

In summary, the use of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is advantageous due to their ordered mesoporous structure, which promotes better dispersion of metal species and facilitates more efficient reactions. The literature highlights the importance of considering factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment in order to optimize catalyst performance and minimize deactivation.

在提供的文献中，对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。将这些OMS支持与传统金属氧化物支持的结构特性和催化行为进行了比较。文献指出，晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活具有显著影响。

OMS催化剂的优势在于其有序的微孔结构，这促进了金属物种的更好分散，并且能够更有效地进行反应。将Zr物种引入到MCM-41骨架中形成的催化剂（PtSn/ZrM）表现出出色的初始乙烷转化率和约99%的乙烯选择性。该催化剂在碳沉积于活性金属位点之外形成石墨状碳的情况下更为耐焦化和稳定。

文献讨论了使用酸性支撑体的局限性，因为在高操作温度下它们可能会诱导碳沉积，导致通过覆盖活性位点而使催化剂失效。文献建议通过调整Zr物种在非酸性支撑体上的使用，可以开发出高度分散和稳定的PtSn催化剂，降低酸度并防止快速失效。

文献还提出，将适度的杂原子引入到微孔材料的框架中，如Ti和V，可以增强烷烃脱氢性能，提供改善催化剂性能的替代策略。

综上所述，OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的应用优势在于其有序的微孔结构，这有助于更好地分散金属物种并促进更有效的反应。文献强调考虑晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素对于优化催化剂性能和减少失效的重要性。
