<p>Strong interaction between ZrO2 and PtSn species, as proved by XPS, results in restrained metal particles, which promotes the initial reactivity.</p>
<p>However, Pt phase generated on surface is disadvantageous for the desorption of produced ethene as indicated by CO-IR and C3H6-TPD, and pyridine-IR and NH3-TPD indicate strong acidity generated.</p>
<p>Both deactivate the catalyst rapidly by deep dehydrogenation and coking.</p>
<p>Moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr with much weaker acidity is formed when framework Zr is incorporated into MCM-41, which benefits the dispersion of metal particles, formation of Pt3Sn/Pt species and stabilization of metal species from phase segregation.</p>
<p>PtSn/ZrM shows the best dehydrogenation efficiency with ca. 99% ethene selectivity, the highest ethane conversion and stability.</p>
<p>Acidity of PtSn/ZrM is weak and remains stable during the reduction process, meanwhile moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr is generated, which benefits the formation, dispersion and stabilization of highly active and selective Pt3Sn/Pt particles.</p>
<p>This catalyst is coking-tolerant by locating carbon deposit mainly on the support instead of active metal species, resulting in much more stable performance.</p>
<p>As for PtSn/Zr/M, impregnation of Zr(NO3)4 solution to M with the same content of Zr as ZrM (3.0 wt%) followed by drying at 200C overnight was firstly applied. Zr/M was annealed at 600C for 1 h before characterization.</p>
<p>Incipient wetness co-impregnation method was applied to load H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 on M and ZrM applying water as the solvent.</p>
<p>It was found that framework Zr can restrain the growth of PtSn particles and stabilize highly active Pt3Sn/Pt without phase segregation by moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr.</p>
<p>The incorporation of moderate heteroatoms to MCM-41 framework to promote ethane dehydrogenation can also be applied to Ti and V, which offers an alternative strategy to achieve better alkane dehydrogenation performance.</p>
<p>Crystallization of the catalyst was confirmed by XRD patterns, showing the presence of MCM-41 framework with the p6mm structure.</p>
<p>UV-vis DRS spectra showed that ZrM exhibited an adsorption edge at ca. 210 nm, indicating the formation of tetrahedral Zr4+ species within the framework.</p>
<p>Pyridine-IR spectra revealed that ZrM had significantly lower acidity compared to Zr/M, attributed to the incorporation of Zr into the framework.</p>
<p>In-situ XRD patterns demonstrated the emergence of Pt and Pt3Sn peaks during the reduction process, indicating the formation of these metal species.</p>
<p>The average particle size of PtSn species was found to be 1.5 nm for PtSn/ZrM, significantly smaller than that of PtSn/M (5.8 nm).</p>
<p>XPS spectra showed that the Pt 4f7/2 peak of PtSn/ZrM shifted to a higher binding energy, suggesting a stronger interaction between Pt and ZrO2.</p>
<p>CO-IR spectra indicated that the peak at ca. 2068 cm1 for PtSn/ZrM was the lowest among the studied catalysts, reflecting higher electron density on the surface Pt atoms.</p>
<p>C3H6-TPD curves showed that PtSn/ZrM had the weakest alkene adsorption capacity, facilitating easier ethene desorption from the active sites.</p>
<p>For PtSn/ZrM, significant CO chemisorption occurred, with the lowest CO adsorption per Pt (COads/Pt) compared to PtSn/M, indicating better dispersion of Pt species.</p>
<p>Initial ethane conversion of PtSn/Zr/M reached 35.5%, significantly higher than that of PtSn/M, attributed to the smallest metal particles and enhanced electron density on the surface Pt atoms.</p>
<p>During ethane dehydrogenation, no growth of PtSn species peaks was observed for PtSn/ZrM, excluding sintering as a factor in deactivation.</p>
<p>TG results showed that the amount of coke on PtSn/ZrM was slightly lower than on PtSn/Zr/M, despite higher ethane conversion, indicating better coking tolerance.</p>
<p>Most of the coke in PtSn/ZrM was graphitic, located on the support rather than on the active metal sites, contributing to enhanced stability and coke tolerance.</p>

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was analyzed. These catalysts showed advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their ordered mesoporous structures and controlled lattice oxygen species. The incorporation of framework Zr into MCM-41 facilitated the formation of a moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr, which stabilized the active metal particles and promoted the formation of Pt3Sn/Pt species without phase segregation. This resulted in a catalyst with high initial reactivity and stability, characterized by low acidity and efficient ethane conversion to ethene. The weak acidity of PtSn/ZrM during the reduction process and the moderation of the interaction between PtSn species and the framework helped to maintain the dispersion of metal particles and prevented rapid deactivation through deep dehydrogenation and coking. Incorporating moderate heteroatoms like Zr, Ti, and V into the MCM-41 framework offered an alternative strategy for achieving better alkane dehydrogenation performance. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influenced catalyst performance and deactivation by affecting the reactivity and stability of the metal species. These findings highlight the potential of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions and suggest strategies for enhancing their activity and longevity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，进行了分析。这些催化剂在传统的金属氧化物支撑材料上具有优势，因为它们具有有序的介孔结构和可控的晶格氧物种。将框架Zr引入MCM-41中促进了PtSn物种与Si-O-Zr之间的适度相互作用，稳定了活性金属颗粒并促进了Pt3Sn/Pt物种的形成而不会发生相分离。这导致了具有高初始活性和稳定性的催化剂，其特征是低酸性和高效的乙烷转化为乙烯。在减少过程中，PtSn/ZrM的弱酸性以及PtSn物种与框架之间适度的相互作用有助于保持金属粒子的分散并防止通过深度脱氢和结焦快速失活。将适量的异质原子如Zr、Ti和V引入MCM-41骨架提供了提高烷烃脱氢性能的替代策略。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素影响了催化剂的性能和失活，影响了金属物种的反应性和稳定性。这些发现突出了OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的潜力，并提出了增强其活性和寿命的策略。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed in the provided literature. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these OMS supports are compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The literature highlights that lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Advantages of using OMS catalysts include their ordered mesoporous structure, which promotes better dispersion of metal species and facilitates more efficient reactions. The incorporation of Zr species into the MCM-41 framework results in a catalyst (PtSn/ZrM) that exhibits outstanding initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity of approximately 99%. This catalyst is more coking-tolerant and stable due to the generation of graphitic carbon on the support rather than on the active metal sites.

Limitations of using acidic supports are discussed, as they can induce carbon deposition under high operation temperatures, leading to deactivation through the coverage of active sites. The literature suggests that modulation of Zr species on a non-acidic support can lead to the development of highly dispersed and stable PtSn catalysts, decreasing acidity, and preventing rapid deactivation.

The literature also proposes that the incorporation of moderate heteroatoms into the framework of mesoporous materials, such as Ti and V, can enhance alkane dehydrogenation performance, offering alternative strategies for achieving better catalyst performance.

In summary, the use of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions is advantageous due to their ordered mesoporous structure, which promotes better dispersion of metal species and facilitates more efficient reactions. The literature highlights the importance of considering factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment in order to optimize catalyst performance and minimize deactivation.

在提供的文献中，对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。将这些OMS支持与传统金属氧化物支持的结构特性和催化行为进行了比较。文献指出，晶格氧物种和H2预处理对PDH反应中催化剂的性能和失活具有显著影响。

OMS催化剂的优势在于其有序的微孔结构，这促进了金属物种的更好分散，并且能够更有效地进行反应。将Zr物种引入到MCM-41骨架中形成的催化剂（PtSn/ZrM）表现出出色的初始乙烷转化率和约99%的乙烯选择性。该催化剂在碳沉积于活性金属位点之外形成石墨状碳的情况下更为耐焦化和稳定。

文献讨论了使用酸性支撑体的局限性，因为在高操作温度下它们可能会诱导碳沉积，导致通过覆盖活性位点而使催化剂失效。文献建议通过调整Zr物种在非酸性支撑体上的使用，可以开发出高度分散和稳定的PtSn催化剂，降低酸度并防止快速失效。

文献还提出，将适度的杂原子引入到微孔材料的框架中，如Ti和V，可以增强烷烃脱氢性能，提供改善催化剂性能的替代策略。

综上所述，OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的应用优势在于其有序的微孔结构，这有助于更好地分散金属物种并促进更有效的反应。文献强调考虑晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素对于优化催化剂性能和减少失效的重要性。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The introduction of framework Zr into MCM-41 supports the formation of Pt3Sn/Pt particles, which are highly active and selective. The moderate interaction between these particles and Si-O-Zr leads to a weak acidity that benefits the dispersion of metal particles, preventing phase segregation and metal sintering.
2. The catalysts containing Zr in the form of ZrO2 show better stability and efficiency in ethane dehydrogenation due to the moderation of acidity and strong interaction between PtSn species and ZrO2. The incorporation of Zr into the framework of MCM-41 leads to the formation of a structure with a balance between strong interaction and weak acidity, benefiting the dispersion of metal particles and the formation of active Pt3Sn/Pt species.
3. The presence of aggregated particles with fewer exposed active sites and phases like PtSn3, which are less active for alkane dehydrogenation, can occur during the reduction and reaction processes due to high temperatures and the different mobility of Pt and Sn. To maintain dehydrogenation efficiency, minimizing PtSn phase segregation and metal sintering is crucial.
4. The catalysts with framework Zr exhibit better dehydrogenation efficiency, with approximately 99% ethene selectivity and high ethane conversion, showing improved stability and coking tolerance. This is due to the generation of graphitic carbon primarily on the support rather than on active metal sites.
5. The fluctuating oil prices and the complexity involved in producing ethene from coal necessitate the development of alternative production methods. Supported PtSn catalysts are commonly used in non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, offering an economically competitive route with the use of low-cost ethane derived from shale gas.
6. During the reduction and reaction processes, aggregated particles with fewer active sites exposed on the surface and low-active phases like PtSn3 may form due to the high operational temperature and the differing mobility of Pt and Sn. This can lead to a decrease in dehydrogenation efficiency, necessitating the minimization of phase segregation and metal sintering to maintain efficiency.
7. The strong interaction between ZrO2 and PtSn species in the catalyst leads to restricted metal particle growth, enhancing initial reactivity. However, the formation of a Pt phase on the surface is disadvantageous for the desorption of ethene, as it generates strong acidity that can deactivate the catalyst rapidly through deep dehydrogenation and coking.
8. Incorporating moderate heteroatoms like Zr, Ti, and V into the framework of mesoporous MCM-41 provides an alternative strategy to enhance ethane dehydrogenation performance, offering a way to develop more stable and dispersed PtSn catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

1. 将框架Zr引入MCM-41中，支持形成高度活性和选择性的Pt3Sn/Pt颗粒。这些颗粒与Si-O-Zr之间的适度相互作用有助于金属颗粒的分散，防止相分离和金属烧结。
2. ZrO2形式的Zr存在的催化剂在乙烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的稳定性和效率，由于其适度的酸性和PtSn物种与ZrO2之间强烈的相互作用。将Zr引入MCM-41骨架结构中形成的结构具有平衡强相互作用和弱酸性，有利于金属颗粒的分散和活性Pt3Sn/Pt颗粒的形成。
3. 在高温度和Pt与Sn的不同移动性下，可能会形成聚集的颗粒，其中暴露的活性位点较少，以及活性较低的相如PtSn3，这可能发生在还原和反应过程中。为了维持脱氢效率，需要最小化相分离和金属烧结。
4. 含有框架Zr的催化剂显示出更高的脱氢效率，大约99%的乙烯选择性和高乙烷转化率，并且显示出增强的抗结焦能力和稳定性。这是由于主要在支撑物上生成石墨碳而不是在活性金属位点上。
5. 石油价格波动和从煤炭生产乙烯的复杂性要求开发替代生产方法。支持PtSn催化剂广泛应用于非氧化脱氢过程，提供了一种经济竞争性的路线，利用来自页岩气的低成本乙烷。
6. 在还原和反应过程中，可能会形成聚合物颗粒，其中表面暴露的活性位点较少，以及低活性相如PtSn3，这可能是由于高温和Pt与Sn的不同移动性导致的。为了维持脱氢效率，需要最小化相分离和金属烧结。
7. ZrO2与PtSn物种之间的强烈相互作用导致金属颗粒生长受限，增强初始反应性。然而，表面形成的Pt相不利于乙烯的脱附，因为它产生强酸性，可以通过深度脱氢和结焦快速失活催化剂。
8. 将适量的Zr、Ti和V等杂原子引入MCM-41骨架提供了提高乙烷脱氢性能的替代策略，为开发更稳定和分散的PtSn催化剂提供了途径以进行烷烃脱氢。
