<p>Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods. Shale gas revolution results in low price of ethane, making the production of ethene from ethane economically competitive.</p>
<p>Supported PtSn catalysts are widely applied in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Pt phase is highly active for alkane dehydrogenation, while Pt3Sn/Pt has been recognized as a better structure compared with Pt for that the desorption of generated ethene on its surface is much easier.</p>
<p>The results indicate that framework Zr can restrain the growth of PtSn particles and stabilize highly active Pt3Sn/Pt without phase segregation by moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr.</p>
<p>UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu U-3100 spectrophotometer equipped with a 60-nm (diameter) integrating sphere using BaSO4 as reflectance.</p>
<p>The generation of PtSn species and ZrO2 in Zr/M was further identified by in-situ XRD (Figure 1c and Figure S3), which shows the emergence of ZrO2 peak at 30.0 for PtSn/Zr/M with the increase of heating temperature.</p>
<p>In-situ XRD patterns (Figure 1c and Figure S3) also identify the crystal structure of metal particles during reduction process.</p>
<p>The sequence of average particle size is PtSn/M (5.8 nm) > PtSn/ZrM (2.5 nm) > PtSn/Zr/M (1.5 nm).</p>
<p>Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and ZrO2 causes the most positive Pt atoms as reported by literature.</p>
<p>The peaks at ca. 1605, 1573, 1489 and 1446 cm1 are recognized for ZrM and Zr/M, attributed to vibration modes of pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites.</p>
<p>On the contrary, not only Zr/M owns stronger acidity, but also the acidity of PtSn/Zr/M is enhanced by hydrogen reduction.</p>
<p>The peaks at ca. 1830 cm1 are due to the bridge-bound CO on large Pt surface (Figure S4).</p>
<p>The peaks at wavenumber higher than 2000 cm1 are assignable to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt atoms.</p>
<p>The peaks at 230, 265 &amp; 360C are due to the oxidation of polycyclic carbons and amorphous carbon that can be easily removed.</p>
<p>The peak at 480C corresponds to coke deposited on surface of PtSn species that is more active to oxygen to promote the burning.</p>
<p>A clear relation of the selectivity of it and the Si/Zr ratio of support is found as shown in Figure S10.</p>
<p>Introduction of framework Zr and ZrO2 promotes initial activity of supported PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in ethane dehydrogenation.</p>
