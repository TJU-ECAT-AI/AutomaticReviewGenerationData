1. The introduction of framework Zr into MCM-41 supports the formation of Pt3Sn/Pt particles, which are highly active and selective. The moderate interaction between these particles and Si-O-Zr leads to a weak acidity that benefits the dispersion of metal particles, preventing phase segregation and metal sintering.
2. The catalysts containing Zr in the form of ZrO2 show better stability and efficiency in ethane dehydrogenation due to the moderation of acidity and strong interaction between PtSn species and ZrO2. The incorporation of Zr into the framework of MCM-41 leads to the formation of a structure with a balance between strong interaction and weak acidity, benefiting the dispersion of metal particles and the formation of active Pt3Sn/Pt species.
3. The presence of aggregated particles with fewer exposed active sites and phases like PtSn3, which are less active for alkane dehydrogenation, can occur during the reduction and reaction processes due to high temperatures and the different mobility of Pt and Sn. To maintain dehydrogenation efficiency, minimizing PtSn phase segregation and metal sintering is crucial.
4. The catalysts with framework Zr exhibit better dehydrogenation efficiency, with approximately 99% ethene selectivity and high ethane conversion, showing improved stability and coking tolerance. This is due to the generation of graphitic carbon primarily on the support rather than on active metal sites.
5. The fluctuating oil prices and the complexity involved in producing ethene from coal necessitate the development of alternative production methods. Supported PtSn catalysts are commonly used in non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, offering an economically competitive route with the use of low-cost ethane derived from shale gas.
6. During the reduction and reaction processes, aggregated particles with fewer active sites exposed on the surface and low-active phases like PtSn3 may form due to the high operational temperature and the differing mobility of Pt and Sn. This can lead to a decrease in dehydrogenation efficiency, necessitating the minimization of phase segregation and metal sintering to maintain efficiency.
7. The strong interaction between ZrO2 and PtSn species in the catalyst leads to restricted metal particle growth, enhancing initial reactivity. However, the formation of a Pt phase on the surface is disadvantageous for the desorption of ethene, as it generates strong acidity that can deactivate the catalyst rapidly through deep dehydrogenation and coking.
8. Incorporating moderate heteroatoms like Zr, Ti, and V into the framework of mesoporous MCM-41 provides an alternative strategy to enhance ethane dehydrogenation performance, offering a way to develop more stable and dispersed PtSn catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

1. 将框架Zr引入MCM-41中，支持形成高度活性和选择性的Pt3Sn/Pt颗粒。这些颗粒与Si-O-Zr之间的适度相互作用有助于金属颗粒的分散，防止相分离和金属烧结。
2. ZrO2形式的Zr存在的催化剂在乙烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的稳定性和效率，由于其适度的酸性和PtSn物种与ZrO2之间强烈的相互作用。将Zr引入MCM-41骨架结构中形成的结构具有平衡强相互作用和弱酸性，有利于金属颗粒的分散和活性Pt3Sn/Pt颗粒的形成。
3. 在高温度和Pt与Sn的不同移动性下，可能会形成聚集的颗粒，其中暴露的活性位点较少，以及活性较低的相如PtSn3，这可能发生在还原和反应过程中。为了维持脱氢效率，需要最小化相分离和金属烧结。
4. 含有框架Zr的催化剂显示出更高的脱氢效率，大约99%的乙烯选择性和高乙烷转化率，并且显示出增强的抗结焦能力和稳定性。这是由于主要在支撑物上生成石墨碳而不是在活性金属位点上。
