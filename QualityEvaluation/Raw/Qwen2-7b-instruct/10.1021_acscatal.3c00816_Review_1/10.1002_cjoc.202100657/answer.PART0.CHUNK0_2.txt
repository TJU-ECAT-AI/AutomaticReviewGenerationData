[1] "Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods."
[2] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route for that the products are valuable ethene and hydrogen (Eq. 1)."
[3] "Supported PtSn catalysts are widely applied in non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[4] "Strong interaction between ZrO2 and PtSn species, as proved by XPS, results in restrained metal particles, which promotes the initial reactivity."
[5] "However, Pt phase generated on surface is disadvantageous for the desorption of produced ethene as indicated by CO-IR and C3H6-TPD."
[6] "What's more, ZrO2 contains plentiful Lewis acid sites,[28] and Brnsted sites are generated upon reduction by hydrogen,[29] which may further deteriorate the coking during dehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "The incorporation of moderate heteroatoms to MCM-41 framework to promote ethane dehydrogenation can also be applied to Ti and V, which offers an alternative strategy to achieve better alkane dehydrogenation performance."
[8] "The preparation procedure and structure of supports are shown in Scheme 1."
[9] "It was found that framework Zr can restrain the growth of PtSn particles and stabilize highly active Pt3Sn/Pt without phase segregation by moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr."
[10] "The weak Lewis acidity remains stable without enhancement for PtSn/ZrM after reduction, and the generated carbon deposit during reaction is largely on support instead of active sites."
[11] "PtSn/ZrM shows the best dehydrogenation efficiency with ca. 99% ethene selectivity, the highest ethane conversion and stability."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed in the literature. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports are compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages of OMS catalysts lie in their ability to provide a well-defined, ordered mesoporous structure, which can lead to improved catalyst performance. The inclusion of VOx and CrOx on these supports allows for enhanced deactivation and coking resistance. However, the literature also discusses the limitations and reaction mechanisms involved in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment are highlighted as factors that significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation. Proper selection and management of these factors can optimize the catalyst's efficiency and longevity in PDH processes.

文献中分析了金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15上负载的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。将这些支持物与传统金属氧化物支持物进行比较。OMS催化剂的优势在于它们能够提供明确的有序介孔结构，这可能导致催化剂性能的改进。在这些支持物上添加VOx和CrOx可以增强脱活和焦化抵抗性。然而，文献也讨论了PDH反应中涉及的局限性和反应机制。晶格氧物种和H2预处理被强调为显著影响催化剂性能和脱活的因素。正确选择和管理这些因素可以优化催化剂在PDH过程中的效率和寿命。
