<p>Strong interaction between ZrO2 and PtSn species, as proved by XPS, results in restrained metal particles, which promotes the initial reactivity.</p>
<p>However, Pt phase generated on surface is disadvantageous for the desorption of produced ethene as indicated by CO-IR and C3H6-TPD, and pyridine-IR and NH3-TPD indicate strong acidity generated.</p>
<p>Both deactivate the catalyst rapidly by deep dehydrogenation and coking.</p>
<p>Moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr with much weaker acidity is formed when framework Zr is incorporated into MCM-41, which benefits the dispersion of metal particles, formation of Pt3Sn/Pt species and stabilization of metal species from phase segregation.</p>
<p>PtSn/ZrM shows the best dehydrogenation efficiency with ca. 99% ethene selectivity, the highest ethane conversion and stability.</p>
<p>Acidity of PtSn/ZrM is weak and remains stable during the reduction process, meanwhile moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr is generated, which benefits the formation, dispersion and stabilization of highly active and selective Pt3Sn/Pt particles.</p>
<p>This catalyst is coking-tolerant by locating carbon deposit mainly on the support instead of active metal species, resulting in much more stable performance.</p>
<p>As for PtSn/Zr/M, impregnation of Zr(NO3)4 solution to M with the same content of Zr as ZrM (3.0 wt%) followed by drying at 200C overnight was firstly applied. Zr/M was annealed at 600C for 1 h before characterization.</p>
<p>Incipient wetness co-impregnation method was applied to load H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 on M and ZrM applying water as the solvent.</p>
<p>It was found that framework Zr can restrain the growth of PtSn particles and stabilize highly active Pt3Sn/Pt without phase segregation by moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr.</p>
<p>The incorporation of moderate heteroatoms to MCM-41 framework to promote ethane dehydrogenation can also be applied to Ti and V, which offers an alternative strategy to achieve better alkane dehydrogenation performance.</p>
<p>Crystallization of the catalyst was confirmed by XRD patterns, showing the presence of MCM-41 framework with the p6mm structure.</p>
<p>UV-vis DRS spectra showed that ZrM exhibited an adsorption edge at ca. 210 nm, indicating the formation of tetrahedral Zr4+ species within the framework.</p>
<p>Pyridine-IR spectra revealed that ZrM had significantly lower acidity compared to Zr/M, attributed to the incorporation of Zr into the framework.</p>
<p>In-situ XRD patterns demonstrated the emergence of Pt and Pt3Sn peaks during the reduction process, indicating the formation of these metal species.</p>
<p>The average particle size of PtSn species was found to be 1.5 nm for PtSn/ZrM, significantly smaller than that of PtSn/M (5.8 nm).</p>
<p>XPS spectra showed that the Pt 4f7/2 peak of PtSn/ZrM shifted to a higher binding energy, suggesting a stronger interaction between Pt and ZrO2.</p>
<p>CO-IR spectra indicated that the peak at ca. 2068 cm1 for PtSn/ZrM was the lowest among the studied catalysts, reflecting higher electron density on the surface Pt atoms.</p>
<p>C3H6-TPD curves showed that PtSn/ZrM had the weakest alkene adsorption capacity, facilitating easier ethene desorption from the active sites.</p>
<p>For PtSn/ZrM, significant CO chemisorption occurred, with the lowest CO adsorption per Pt (COads/Pt) compared to PtSn/M, indicating better dispersion of Pt species.</p>
<p>Initial ethane conversion of PtSn/Zr/M reached 35.5%, significantly higher than that of PtSn/M, attributed to the smallest metal particles and enhanced electron density on the surface Pt atoms.</p>
<p>During ethane dehydrogenation, no growth of PtSn species peaks was observed for PtSn/ZrM, excluding sintering as a factor in deactivation.</p>
<p>TG results showed that the amount of coke on PtSn/ZrM was slightly lower than on PtSn/Zr/M, despite higher ethane conversion, indicating better coking tolerance.</p>
<p>Most of the coke in PtSn/ZrM was graphitic, located on the support rather than on the active metal sites, contributing to enhanced stability and coke tolerance.</p>

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was analyzed. These catalysts showed advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their ordered mesoporous structures and controlled lattice oxygen species. The incorporation of framework Zr into MCM-41 facilitated the formation of a moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr, which stabilized the active metal particles and promoted the formation of Pt3Sn/Pt species without phase segregation. This resulted in a catalyst with high initial reactivity and stability, characterized by low acidity and efficient ethane conversion to ethene. The weak acidity of PtSn/ZrM during the reduction process and the moderation of the interaction between PtSn species and the framework helped to maintain the dispersion of metal particles and prevented rapid deactivation through deep dehydrogenation and coking. Incorporating moderate heteroatoms like Zr, Ti, and V into the MCM-41 framework offered an alternative strategy for achieving better alkane dehydrogenation performance. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influenced catalyst performance and deactivation by affecting the reactivity and stability of the metal species. These findings highlight the potential of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions and suggest strategies for enhancing their activity and longevity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，进行了分析。这些催化剂在传统的金属氧化物支撑材料上具有优势，因为它们具有有序的介孔结构和可控的晶格氧物种。将框架Zr引入MCM-41中促进了PtSn物种与Si-O-Zr之间的适度相互作用，稳定了活性金属颗粒并促进了Pt3Sn/Pt物种的形成而不会发生相分离。这导致了具有高初始活性和稳定性的催化剂，其特征是低酸性和高效的乙烷转化为乙烯。在减少过程中，PtSn/ZrM的弱酸性以及PtSn物种与框架之间适度的相互作用有助于保持金属粒子的分散并防止通过深度脱氢和结焦快速失活。将适量的异质原子如Zr、Ti和V引入MCM-41骨架提供了提高烷烃脱氢性能的替代策略。晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素影响了催化剂的性能和失活，影响了金属物种的反应性和稳定性。这些发现突出了OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的潜力，并提出了增强其活性和寿命的策略。
