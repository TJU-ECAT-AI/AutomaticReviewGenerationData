Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, notably MCM-41 and SBA-15, have been extensively utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique properties and enhanced catalytic performance. These materials, when supported with transition metals like vanadium (VOx) and chromium (CrOx), offer an efficient platform for PDH, which is pivotal in the production of propylene from propane. The structure of OMS catalysts, characterized by well-defined mesopores and high surface area, facilitates the effective adsorption and desorption of reactants, contributing to improved selectivity and activity. 

MCM-41, with its cubic structure, provides a uniform pore size distribution, which is advantageous for consistent catalytic performance. In contrast, SBA-15, known for its hierarchical structure, offers a combination of large external surface area and mesopores, enhancing both reactivity and stability. When these OMS supports are loaded with VOx or CrOx, they exhibit superior deactivation resistance compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts, making them particularly suitable for industrial applications.

In terms of reaction mechanisms, PDH over these catalysts typically involves the initial adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface, followed by the activation of hydrogen bonds and subsequent dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of propylene. The presence of transition metals accelerates this process by providing active sites for the reaction, while the ordered mesoporous structure ensures that these active sites are well dispersed, minimizing sintering and maintaining high activity over multiple cycles.

However, the use of OMS catalysts in PDH also presents several challenges. These include the potential for sintering due to the high operating temperatures required for the reaction, which can lead to a loss of surface area and active sites. Additionally, the development of robust methods for loading transition metals onto the mesoporous framework without compromising the material's structural integrity remains an ongoing challenge. Furthermore, the optimization of reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation is critical but complex.

Despite these challenges, the comparative analysis of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts underscores their potential for advancing PDH technology, offering a promising avenue for more efficient and sustainable petrochemical processes.
