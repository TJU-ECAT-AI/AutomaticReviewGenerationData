The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been analyzed. These catalysts exhibit distinct structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The presence of lattice oxygen species on the surface of these catalysts plays a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. H2 pretreatment can significantly influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

Advantages of OMS catalysts include improved surface area and controlled pore size, which can enhance the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. However, limitations may arise due to the susceptibility of lattice oxygen species to deactivation upon exposure to high temperatures or impurities in the feedstock.

In terms of reaction mechanisms, the lattice oxygen species act as reactive oxygen sources that promote the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Factors such as the type of metal oxide support, its loading, and the presence of activators can affect the activity and stability of the catalysts.

H2 pretreatment can prevent the adsorption of inhibiting species on the catalyst surface, thus reducing deactivation rates and improving the overall efficiency of the PDH process. The structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports also affects the distribution of active sites, influencing the selectivity towards propylene.

In conclusion, the use of OMS catalysts in PDH reactions offers several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports, including enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment play significant roles in determining the performance of these catalysts in PDH processes.

对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了分析。这些催化剂与传统金属氧化物支持相比，具有独特的结构特性和催化行为。表面的晶格氧物种在PDH反应机制中起着关键作用。通过氢气预处理可以显著影响催化剂性能和PDH反应过程中的失活。

OMS催化剂的优势包括改进的比表面积和可控的孔径，这可以增强反应动力学和产物选择性。然而，由于晶格氧物种在高温或原料中杂质暴露下的易失效，可能会存在局限性。

就反应机制而言，晶格氧物种作为活性氧源促进丙烷脱氢为丙烯。催化剂类型、负载以及激活剂的存在会影响其活性和稳定性。

氢气预处理可以防止抑制性物质吸附在催化剂表面，从而降低失活速率并提高PDH过程的整体效率。MCM-41和SBA-15支撑体的结构也影响活性位点的分布，影响丙烯选择性的选择性。

综上所述，在PDH过程中使用OMS催化剂提供了一系列优于传统金属氧化物支持的优点，包括增强的活性、选择性和稳定性。晶格氧物种和氢气预处理在确定这些催化剂PDH过程中的性能方面起着重要作用。
