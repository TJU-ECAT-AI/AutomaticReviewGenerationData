Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involves considering several factors. These include structural properties, catalytic behavior, and the influence of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 materials are characterized by their well-defined mesoporous structures, which offer increased surface area and controlled pore size, advantageous for adsorption and reaction kinetics. 

The VOx and CrOx materials act as active sites for PDH reactions, where VOx materials have been observed to exhibit high selectivity for propene production due to the lattice oxygen species that facilitate the dehydrogenation process. The presence of lattice oxygen allows for a more efficient and selective conversion of propane to propene compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

H2 pretreatment is crucial for improving catalyst stability and activity in PDH reactions. It helps in removing surface impurities and activating the metal sites, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. This pretreatment process ensures that the catalyst is in an optimal state for the PDH reaction, reducing deactivation rates and prolonging the catalyst's lifetime.

The advantages of using MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions include their high efficiency, selectivity towards propene production, and improved stability. However, limitations include the need for careful control of the synthesis conditions to achieve desired pore characteristics and the potential for catalyst deactivation over time, which may require regular regeneration or replacement.

In conclusion, the use of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions offers significant improvements in efficiency and selectivity, supported by advanced simulation techniques that aid in the effective design of catalytic reactors. H2 pretreatment plays a critical role in enhancing catalyst performance and stability, contributing to the overall effectiveness of these systems in propane dehydrogenation processes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是由VOx和CrOx支持的MCM-41和SBA-15的性能涉及到几个因素。这些包括结构属性、催化行为以及晶格氧物种和H2预处理的影响。MCM-41和SBA-15材料以其定义明确的微孔结构而闻名，这提供了增加的比表面积和可控的孔径大小，对于吸附和反应动力学非常有利。

VOx和CrOx材料作为PDH反应中的活性位点，在存在晶格氧时表现出高丙烯选择性，这有助于促进丙烷到丙烯的脱氢过程。晶格氧的存在使得与传统金属氧化物支持相比，使用这些材料进行PDH反应时丙烷向丙烯的转化更为有效且选择性更高。

H2预处理对提高PDH反应中的催化剂稳定性及活性至关重要。它有助于去除表面杂质并激活金属位点，从而提高催化剂性能。这一预处理过程确保催化剂处于最佳状态以进行PDH反应，减少了催化剂失活速率并延长了催化剂的使用寿命。

MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的优势包括其高效性和高选择性，丙烯生产，并且具有改进的稳定性。然而，它们也存在一些限制，如需要精确控制合成条件以获得所需的孔特性，以及催化剂随时间可能发生的失活，这可能需要定期再生或更换催化剂。

综上所述，使用MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中提供显著的效率和选择性的提升，得益于先进的模拟技术，这些技术有助于设计有效的催化反应器。H2预处理在增强催化剂性能和稳定性方面发挥着关键作用，对这些系统整体在丙烷脱氢过程中的有效性贡献重大。
