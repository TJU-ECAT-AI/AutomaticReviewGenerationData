The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been extensively studied. These catalysts exhibit distinct structural properties and catalytic behaviors compared to traditional metal oxide supports. MCM-41 and SBA-15 possess ordered mesoporous structures, which provide large surface areas and well-defined pore sizes. This feature facilitates efficient diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

The lattice oxygen species on the surface of these catalysts play a crucial role in the PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen can facilitate the oxidation process by providing reactive oxygen atoms, which are essential for the dehydrogenation step. Additionally, the presence of lattice oxygen can also affect the selectivity of the PDH reaction, influencing the formation of propylene versus other products.

H2 pretreatment of the catalysts prior to the PDH reaction can lead to improved performance. This pretreatment can activate the catalyst surface, creating more active sites for the reaction. It can also adjust the catalyst's acidity or basicity, which can have significant impacts on the reaction kinetics and product distribution.

However, factors such as the lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can also cause deactivation over time. The repeated exposure to oxygen and hydrogen can lead to the formation of surface impurities or changes in the catalyst's structure, which can diminish its catalytic activity. Understanding and optimizing these factors is crucial for enhancing the long-term stability and efficiency of the PDH process using MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能已经进行了广泛的研究。这些催化剂与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，具有不同的结构特性和催化行为。MCM-41和SBA-15具有有序介孔结构，提供了大量的表面积和定义明确的孔隙尺寸。这种特性有利于反应物和产物的高效扩散，从而提高催化效率。

这些催化剂表面的晶格氧物种在PDH反应中起着关键作用。晶格氧可以提供活性氧原子，促进脱氢过程。此外，晶格氧的存在还可以影响PDH反应的选择性，从而影响丙烯和其他产品的形成。

在PDH反应前对催化剂进行氢气预处理可以提高其性能。这种预处理可以激活催化剂表面，产生更多的活性位点以促进反应。它还可以调整催化剂的酸碱性，这对于反应动力学和产物分布有显著影响。

然而，晶格氧物种和氢气预处理也可能导致催化剂失活。反复暴露于氧气和氢气可能导致表面杂质的形成或催化剂结构的变化，从而降低其催化活性。理解并优化这些因素对于使用MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂提高PDH过程的长期稳定性和效率至关重要。
