The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been extensively studied. These catalysts offer several advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their well-defined mesoporous structures, which facilitate enhanced mass transfer and improved surface area. 

MCM-41 and SBA-15 have been employed as supports for VOx and CrOx, allowing for the generation of lattice oxygen species within the catalyst matrix. This lattice oxygen facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, providing high selectivity and efficiency. The lattice oxygen species act as an efficient oxidant, promoting the dehydrogenation reaction without the need for additional oxygen sources.

The size of the TS-1 support also plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The size of the support influences the dispersion of the precious metals, which affects the surface area available for the reaction and thus the overall catalytic activity. Smaller particle sizes can lead to higher surface areas and potentially better performance, although they may also increase the risk of sintering and deactivation.

In terms of deactivation behavior, factors such as H2 pretreatment can significantly impact catalyst performance in PDH reactions. H2 pretreatment helps to remove adsorbed species and activate the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing its stability and activity. However, excessive H2 treatment can lead to deactivation by altering the surface properties of the catalyst.

The lattice oxygen species generated within the VOx/CaO/γAl2O3 catalysts play a critical role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These species enable the selective conversion of propane into propylene, contributing to high yields and selectivities. The presence of these oxygen species facilitates the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of C=C double bonds, characteristic of the dehydrogenation process.

Overall, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica catalysts, especially those supported with VOx and CrOx, exhibit promising performance in Propane Dehydrogenation reactions, offering high selectivity and efficiency. Factors such as lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, and support size contribute to the optimization of these catalysts for PDH applications.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能已经进行了广泛的研究。与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，这些催化剂由于其定义明确的介孔结构，提供了增强的传质和改进的表面面积等优点。

MCM-41和SBA-15被用作VOx和CrOx的支持物，允许在催化剂矩阵中生成晶格氧物种。这种晶格氧促进了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应，提供了高选择性和效率。晶格氧物种作为高效的氧化剂，可以在不需要额外氧气的情况下促进脱氢反应。

晶粒尺寸对TS-1支持的催化性能也至关重要，特别是用于丙烷脱氢的PtSn/TS-1催化剂。晶粒尺寸影响贵金属的分散性，影响反应表面面积和整体催化活性。较小的颗粒尺寸可能导致更高的表面积和潜在更好的性能，尽管它们也可能增加烧结和失活的风险。

H2预处理因素对PDH反应中的催化剂性能有显著影响。H2预处理有助于去除吸附物种并激活催化剂表面，从而提高其稳定性和活性。然而，过度的H2处理可能会导致失活，通过改变催化剂表面的性质。

在VOx/CaO/γAl2O3催化剂中生成的晶格氧物种在丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢过程中发挥着关键作用。这些物种使丙烷的选择性转化为丙烯，导致高产率和选择性。这些氧物种促进了C-H键的断裂和C=C双键的形成，这是脱氢过程的特征。

总的来说，金属有序介孔硅催化剂，尤其是那些由VOx和CrOx支持的催化剂，在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出有前景的性能，提供高选择性和效率。晶格氧物种、H2预处理和支撑尺寸等因素对于优化这些催化剂用于PDH应用具有重要作用。
