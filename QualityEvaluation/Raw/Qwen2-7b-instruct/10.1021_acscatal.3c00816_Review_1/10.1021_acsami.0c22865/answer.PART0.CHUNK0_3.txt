The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, supporting VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports based on their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The study highlighted the impact of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation during PDH reactions.
