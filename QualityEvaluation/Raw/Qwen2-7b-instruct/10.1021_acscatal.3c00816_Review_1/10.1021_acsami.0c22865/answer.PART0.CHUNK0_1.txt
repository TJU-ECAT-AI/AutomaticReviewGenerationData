The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported with VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study compared these catalysts' structural properties and catalytic behavior against traditional metal oxide supports, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. The impact of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions was also discussed.
