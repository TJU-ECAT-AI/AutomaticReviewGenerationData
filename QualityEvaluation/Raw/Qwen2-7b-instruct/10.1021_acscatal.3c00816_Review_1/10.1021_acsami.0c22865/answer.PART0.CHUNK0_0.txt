Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported with VOx and CrOx, were studied for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The comparison with traditional metal oxide supports highlighted their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The discussion covered the advantages and limitations of these materials, along with the mechanisms underlying their reactivity. The impact of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation was also addressed.
