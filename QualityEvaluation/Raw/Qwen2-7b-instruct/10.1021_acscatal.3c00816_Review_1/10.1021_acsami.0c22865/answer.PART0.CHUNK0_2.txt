<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports based on their structural properties and catalytic behavior. Key factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation included lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment. The study highlighted the advantages and limitations of these materials in PDH reactions.
