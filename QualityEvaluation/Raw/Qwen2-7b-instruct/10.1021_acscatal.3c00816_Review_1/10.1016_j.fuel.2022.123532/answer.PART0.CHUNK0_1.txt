[1] "In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance."
[2] "This study proves that both the highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species play the key role in propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Furthermore, the reasons for its rapid deactivation have been analyzed, which are possibly due to both the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction."
[4] "The dehydrogenation activity can be recovered to some extent through the regeneration of the spent catalyst in oxidative atmosphere."

The study demonstrates that Pb/SiO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation, with both highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species being active sites. The rapid deactivation is attributed to the reduction of PbO species and sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction. The dehydrogenation activity can be partially restored by regenerating the spent catalyst in an oxidative atmosphere.

该研究证明，Pb/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢中表现出高催化活性，其中高度分散的Pb2+物种和金属Pb物种起关键作用。快速失活可能归因于PbO物种的还原和Pb及PbO物种在反应过程中的烧结。通过在氧化气氛下再生耗尽的催化剂，可以部分恢复脱氢活性。
