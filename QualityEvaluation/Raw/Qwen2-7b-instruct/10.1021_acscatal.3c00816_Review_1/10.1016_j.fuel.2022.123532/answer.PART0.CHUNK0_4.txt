This literature focuses on the catalytic performance of Pb/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It demonstrates that both dispersed Pb2+ ions and metallic Pb species are crucial for the process. The catalyst's rapid deactivation might be attributed to the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species. However, the dehydrogenation activity can be partially restored through regenerating the spent catalyst in an oxidative atmosphere, albeit with some irreversible loss of Pb species and incomplete redispersion of agglomerated Pb species.

The literature also touches upon the catalytic activity of fourth group elements for dehydrogenation reactions, including carbon materials and Sn species. It suggests that exploring the catalytic potential of other elements within the fourth group could offer new insights into alkane dehydrogenation catalyst development.

Comparing Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15, to traditional metal oxide supports for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the text does not provide direct comparisons. It focuses more on the characteristics of Pb/SiO2 catalysts. The advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of OMS catalysts would depend on their specific properties such as lattice oxygen species and hydrogen pretreatment, which are not detailed in this document. The text does not specify how these factors influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

这篇文献主要关注铅/二氧化硅催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能。它表明，分散的铅离子和金属铅物种对于过程至关重要。催化剂的快速失活可能归因于铅氧化物物种的还原和铅及其氧化物物种的烧结。然而，通过在氧化气氛下再生耗尽的催化剂可以部分恢复脱氢活性，尽管存在一些不可逆的铅物种损失和聚集铅物种的不完全再分散。

文献还提到了第四组元素在脱氢反应中的催化活性，包括碳材料和锡物种。它暗示探索第四组中其他元素的催化潜力可能为烷烃脱氢催化剂的发展提供新见解。

将金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15与传统金属氧化物支持进行比较用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，本文没有提供直接比较。它更侧重于铅/二氧化硅催化剂的特点。OMS催化剂的优势、限制和反应机制取决于其特定属性，如晶格氧物种和氢预处理，这些在本文中没有详细说明。本文没有具体说明这些因素如何影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能和失活。
