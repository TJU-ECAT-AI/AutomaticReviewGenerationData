[1] "In the past few years, C, the fourth group nonmetallic element, has been proved to possess catalytic activity for both non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "Among them, the active carbon samples not only include the artificially synthesized carbon materials, but also involve the coke formed during the dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "Metallic Sn species [11] and Sn2+ species [13] ,[14] have both been regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation."
[4] "In addition, the dehydrogenation behavior of Sn/SiO2 catalyst is even comparable to that of PtSn catalyst."
[5] "Therefore, we explored the potential of Pb/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propene in this study."
[6] "The prepared catalyst calcined under N2 atmosphere is marked as 15Pb/SiO2-N2."
[7] "The reasons for its rapid deactivation have been analyzed, which are possibly due to both the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction."
[8] "Dehydrogenation activity can be recovered to some extent through the regeneration of the spent catalyst in oxidative atmosphere."

The study investigates the potential of Lead (Pb)-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propene, focusing on the role of both highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species in the process. It is found that the rapid deactivation of the Pb/SiO2 catalyst is likely due to the reduction of PbO species and sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction. However, the dehydrogenation activity can be partially restored by regenerating the spent catalyst in an oxidative atmosphere.

该研究探讨了铅（Pb）基催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的可能性，重点关注Pb2+物种和金属Pb物种在过程中的作用。发现Pb/SiO2催化剂的快速失活可能由于铅氧化物物种的还原以及反应过程中铅和铅氧化物物种的结块导致。然而，通过在氧化气氛下再生耗尽的催化剂，可以部分恢复脱氢活性。
