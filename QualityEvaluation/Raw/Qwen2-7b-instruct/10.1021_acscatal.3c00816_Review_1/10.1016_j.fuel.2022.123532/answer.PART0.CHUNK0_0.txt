[1] "Similar to Sn-based catalysts, Pb, located at the same main group ( A), also exhibits a high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation when supported on silica."
[2] "This study proves that both the highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species play the key role in propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "The reasons for its rapid deactivation have been analyzed, which are possibly due to both the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction."
[4] "The dehydrogenation activity can be recovered to some extent through the regeneration of the spent catalyst in oxidative atmosphere, while the loss of Pb species and incomplete redispersion of the agglomerated Pb species results in irreversible deactivation."

Metallic lead (Pb) supported on silica demonstrates high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. Both highly dispersed Pb2+ ions and metallic Pb species are identified as key active sites in this process. The catalyst's rapid deactivation might occur due to the reduction of PbO species and sintering of Pb and PbO species. Through oxidative atmosphere regeneration, some dehydrogenation activity can be restored, although irreversible deactivation may result from the loss of Pb species and inadequate redispersion of aggregated Pb species.

金属铅（Pb）支持在硅酸盐上，对于丙烷脱氢表现出高催化活性。高度分散的Pb2+离子和金属Pb物种被证明是脱氢的关键活性位点。催化剂快速失活可能是由于PbO物种的还原以及Pb和PbO物种的烧结。通过氧化气氛再生，可以部分恢复脱氢活性，但损失的Pb物种和聚集的Pb物种不完全再分散可能会导致不可逆失活。
