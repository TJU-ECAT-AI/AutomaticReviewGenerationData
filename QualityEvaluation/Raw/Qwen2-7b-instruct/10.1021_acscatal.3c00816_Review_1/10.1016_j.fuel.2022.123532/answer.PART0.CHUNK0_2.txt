<p>In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance.</p>
<p>Both the highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species play the key role in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The reasons for its rapid deactivation have been analyzed, which are possibly due to both the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction.</p>
<p>The dehydrogenation activity can be recovered to some extent through the regeneration of the spent catalyst in oxidative atmosphere, while the loss of Pb species and incomplete redispersion of the agglomerated Pb species results in irreversible deactivation.</p>

1. The Pb/SiO2 catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation, with both the highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species playing key roles in the process.
2. The rapid deactivation of the catalyst is attributed to the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction.
3. The dehydrogenation activity can be partially restored by regenerating the spent catalyst in an oxidative atmosphere, although the loss of Pb species and the inadequate redispersion of agglomerated Pb species lead to irreversible deactivation.

1. Pb/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢中表现出高催化活性，其中高度分散的Pb2+物种和金属Pb物种起着关键作用。
2. 催化剂快速失活的原因可能是PbO物种的还原以及反应过程中Pb和PbO物种的结块。
3. 通过在氧化气氛下再生失效催化剂，可以部分恢复脱氢活性。然而，Pb物种的损失和聚集的Pb物种的不完全重新分散导致不可逆失活。
