[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."
[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."
[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."
[5] "In this work, the catalyst preparation method is quite facile and has the potential to be utilized for industrial production."

This study examines the performance of Cr-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. It specifically investigates how the addition time of chromium precursors during the sol-gel process affects the dispersion of chromium oxides (CrOX), surface physical-chemical properties, and catalytic activity of these materials. The Cr/MSS-2 catalyst, obtained by adding the chromium precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) stage, demonstrates optimal catalytic activity. While Cr/MSS-1 also exhibits good CrOX dispersion, the presence of CrOX encapsulated within the mesoporous silica spheres leads to reduced catalytic performance. This research suggests that the preparation method for Cr/MSS-X catalysts is straightforward and may be suitable for industrial application.

本研究考察了Cr掺杂介孔二氧化硅球（Cr/MSS-X）在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的性能。特别关注了溶胶凝胶过程中铬前体添加时间对铬氧化物（CrOX）分散、表面物理化学性质和催化活性的影响。通过在四乙氧基硅酸酯（TEOS）阶段之后添加铬前体获得的Cr/MSS-2催化剂显示出最佳的催化活性。尽管Cr/MSS-1也表现出良好的CrOX分散，但在介孔二氧化硅球中心封装的CrOX导致了较低的催化活性。这项研究表明Cr/MSS-X催化剂的制备方法简单，并可能适用于工业应用。
