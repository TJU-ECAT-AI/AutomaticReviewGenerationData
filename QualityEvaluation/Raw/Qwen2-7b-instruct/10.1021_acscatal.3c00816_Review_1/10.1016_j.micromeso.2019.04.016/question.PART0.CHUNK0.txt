I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2. The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance. Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity. Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity. In this work, the catalyst preparation method is quite facile and has the potential to be utilized for industrial production.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
