The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically Cr/MSS-X, was evaluated in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study indicates that the addition time of chromium precursor significantly affects the dispersion of chromium oxide (CrOX), surface physical-chemical properties, and the catalytic performance of the Cr/MSS-X catalysts. Among the Cr/MSS-X catalysts, Cr/MSS-2, which was synthesized by adding the chromium precursor after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity. This is attributed to the effective dispersion of CrOX. Another catalyst, Cr/MSS-1, showed good dispersion but had weaker catalytic activity due to part of the CrOX being encapsulated within the mesoporous silica spheres. The preparation method used in this research is straightforward and holds potential for industrial application.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是Cr/MSS-X的性能进行了评估。研究结果表明，铬前体添加时间显著影响铬氧化物（CrOX）的分散、表面物理化学性质及其催化性能。Cr/MSS-X系列催化剂中，通过在四乙氧基硅酸酯（TEOS）之后添加铬前体合成的Cr/MSS-2表现出最佳的催化活性。这是由于CrOX的有效分散所致。另一个催化剂Cr/MSS-1也显示了良好的CrOX分散性，但由于部分CrOX被包覆在介孔二氧化硅球内部，导致其催化活性较弱。这项研究使用的催化剂制备方法简便，具有工业应用的潜力。
