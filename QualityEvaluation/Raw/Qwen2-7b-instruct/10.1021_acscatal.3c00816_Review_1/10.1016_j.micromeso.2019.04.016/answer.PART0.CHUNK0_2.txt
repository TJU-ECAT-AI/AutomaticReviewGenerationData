[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."
[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."
[4] "In this work, the catalyst preparation method is quite facile and has the potential to be utilized for industrial production."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It was observed that the structure and catalytic behavior of these OMS catalysts significantly depend on the preparation method and the time of chromium precursor addition. Specifically, the Cr/MSS-2 catalyst, prepared by adding the chromium precursor after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity in PDH reactions. This indicates that the lattice oxygen species and hydrogen pretreatment play crucial roles in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation. The ease of catalyst preparation suggests potential for industrial application.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（PDH）反应中，分析了金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx的性能。研究发现，这些OMS催化剂的结构和催化行为显著依赖于制备方法和铬前体添加时间。具体而言，通过在四乙氧基硅酸酯（TEOS）之后添加铬前体获得的Cr/MSS-2催化剂，在PDH反应中表现出最佳的催化活性。这表明，晶格氧物种和氢预处理在影响催化剂性能和失活方面起着关键作用。易于催化剂制备的特点暗示其有潜在的工业应用价值。
