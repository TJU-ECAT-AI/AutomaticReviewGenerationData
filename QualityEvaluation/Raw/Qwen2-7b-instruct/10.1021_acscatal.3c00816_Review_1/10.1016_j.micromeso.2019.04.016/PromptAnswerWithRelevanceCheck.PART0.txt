Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."
[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."
[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

In the study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation, CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were synthesized through the sol-gel method with different Cr adding times. It was found that the choice of Cr adding time significantly affects the dispersion of CrOX, the surface physical-chemical properties, and thus the catalytic performance of the Cr/MSS-X catalysts. Among these, Cr/MSS-2 catalysts, which had the Cr precursor added after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated the best catalytic activity. While Cr/MSS-1 also showed good dispersion of CrOX, the presence of CrOX within the center of the mesoporous silica spheres led to weaker catalytic performance.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically Cr/MSS-X, was evaluated in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study indicates that the addition time of chromium precursor significantly affects the dispersion of chromium oxide (CrOX), surface physical-chemical properties, and the catalytic performance of the Cr/MSS-X catalysts. Among the Cr/MSS-X catalysts, Cr/MSS-2, which was synthesized by adding the chromium precursor after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity. This is attributed to the effective dispersion of CrOX. Another catalyst, Cr/MSS-1, showed good dispersion but had weaker catalytic activity due to part of the CrOX being encapsulated within the mesoporous silica spheres. The preparation method used in this research is straightforward and holds potential for industrial application.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，对金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是Cr/MSS-X的性能进行了评估。研究结果表明，铬前体添加时间显著影响铬氧化物（CrOX）的分散、表面物理化学性质及其催化性能。Cr/MSS-X系列催化剂中，通过在四乙氧基硅酸酯（TEOS）之后添加铬前体合成的Cr/MSS-2表现出最佳的催化活性。这是由于CrOX的有效分散所致。另一个催化剂Cr/MSS-1也显示了良好的CrOX分散性，但由于部分CrOX被包覆在介孔二氧化硅球内部，导致其催化活性较弱。这项研究使用的催化剂制备方法简便，具有工业应用的潜力。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It was observed that the structure and catalytic behavior of these OMS catalysts significantly depend on the preparation method and the time of chromium precursor addition. Specifically, the Cr/MSS-2 catalyst, prepared by adding the chromium precursor after tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated optimal catalytic activity in PDH reactions. This indicates that the lattice oxygen species and hydrogen pretreatment play crucial roles in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation. The ease of catalyst preparation suggests potential for industrial application.

The performance of Cr/MSS-X catalysts, synthesized via the sol-gel method, is notably influenced by the time of chromium precursor addition. Cr/MSS-2, synthesized by adding the chromium precursor post-tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), exhibits optimal catalytic activity. While Cr/MSS-1 displays good dispersion of chromium oxide, part of it is encapsulated within the mesoporous silica sphere, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency. This study suggests that the synthesis method, specifically the timing of chromium addition, significantly impacts the structure, properties, and catalytic performance of the catalysts.
