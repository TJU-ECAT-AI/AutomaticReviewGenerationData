The performance of Cr/MSS-X catalysts, synthesized via the sol-gel method, is notably influenced by the time of chromium precursor addition. Cr/MSS-2, synthesized by adding the chromium precursor post-tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), exhibits optimal catalytic activity. While Cr/MSS-1 displays good dispersion of chromium oxide, part of it is encapsulated within the mesoporous silica sphere, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency. This study suggests that the synthesis method, specifically the timing of chromium addition, significantly impacts the structure, properties, and catalytic performance of the catalysts.

溶胶法合成的Cr/MSS-X催化剂的性能显著受到铬前体添加时间的影响。在TEOS之后添加铬前体得到的Cr/MSS-2催化剂表现出最佳的催化活性。虽然Cr/MSS-1显示出良好的铬氧化物分散性，但部分铬氧化物被包裹在介孔二氧化硅球中，导致催化效率降低。这项研究表明，催化剂的合成方法，特别是铬添加的时间，对催化剂的结构、性质和催化性能有显著影响。
