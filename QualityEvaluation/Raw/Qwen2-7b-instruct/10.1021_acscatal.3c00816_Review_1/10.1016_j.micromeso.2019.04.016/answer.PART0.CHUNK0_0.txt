[1] "CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were prepared by adding Cr precursors at different preparation stages using sol-gel method (X=1, 2, 3) and incipient-wetness impregnation method (X=4), and their catalytic performances of propane oxidative dehydrogenation were evaluated in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The results indicate that for the Cr/MSS-X catalysts prepared by sol-gel method, Cr adding time significantly influences the Cr dispersion, surface physic-chemical properties and their catalytic performance."
[3] "Cr/MSS-2 catalysts obtained by adding Cr precursor after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) show the optimal catalytic activity."
[4] "Although Cr/MSS-1 also shows good CrOX dispersion, part CrOX wrapped in the center of mesoporous silica spheres presents weaker catalytic activity."

In the study of propane oxidative dehydrogenation, CrOX-doped mesoporous silica spheres (Cr/MSS-X) were synthesized through the sol-gel method with different Cr adding times. It was found that the choice of Cr adding time significantly affects the dispersion of CrOX, the surface physical-chemical properties, and thus the catalytic performance of the Cr/MSS-X catalysts. Among these, Cr/MSS-2 catalysts, which had the Cr precursor added after the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS), demonstrated the best catalytic activity. While Cr/MSS-1 also showed good dispersion of CrOX, the presence of CrOX within the center of the mesoporous silica spheres led to weaker catalytic performance.

在丙烷氧化脱氢的研究中，通过溶胶-凝胶方法制备了CrOX掺杂的介孔二氧化硅球（Cr/MSS-X），使用不同的Cr添加时间。研究发现，Cr添加时间的选择显著影响了CrOX的分散、表面物理化学性质及其催化性能。其中，Cr/MSS-2催化剂，在四乙氧基硅酸酯（TEOS）之后添加Cr前体，表现出最佳的催化活性。虽然Cr/MSS-1也显示出良好的CrOX分散，但在介孔二氧化硅球中心存在的CrOX导致了较弱的催化性能。
