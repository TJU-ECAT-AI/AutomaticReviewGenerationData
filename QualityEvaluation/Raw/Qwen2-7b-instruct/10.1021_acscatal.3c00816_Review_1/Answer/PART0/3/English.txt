Both oxidized and reduced forms of VOx/MCM-41 exhibited superior time-on-stream stability across all dehydrogenation (DH) cycles, with full recoverability of activity upon oxidative regeneration. The impact of hydrogen reduction on the catalyst's dehydrogenation properties was also explored. VOx species remained stable over four DH cycles, contrasting with the aggregation of CrOx species. From a thermodynamic perspective, the oxidative (ODH) pathway is more appealing than non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Vanadium-based catalysts were further examined for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study compared their structural properties and catalytic behavior against traditional metal oxide supports, highlighting the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms involved. Additionally, the effects of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment were discussed as influencing factors on catalyst performance and deactivation during PDH reactions.
