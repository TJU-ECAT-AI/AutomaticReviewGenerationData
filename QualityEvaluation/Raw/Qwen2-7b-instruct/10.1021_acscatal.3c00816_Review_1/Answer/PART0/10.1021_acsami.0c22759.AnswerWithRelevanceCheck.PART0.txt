      <English>
          The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported with VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports in terms of their structural properties and catalytic behavior, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms associated with them. The factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment were considered in relation to their influence on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
