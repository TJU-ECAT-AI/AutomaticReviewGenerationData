          The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts demonstrated superior activity and stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Structural properties, such as lattice oxygen species and porosity, play a crucial role in determining the catalysts' catalytic behavior during PDH reactions. H2 pretreatment was identified as an effective method to prevent deactivation due to carbon deposition.
