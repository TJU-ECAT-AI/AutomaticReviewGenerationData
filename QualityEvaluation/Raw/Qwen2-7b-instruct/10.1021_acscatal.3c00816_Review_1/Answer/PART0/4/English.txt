The exceptional capability of VOx/MCM-41 to fully regain its dehydrogenation (DH) activity and selectivity after oxidative regeneration is attributed to the preservation of the nature of the highly dispersed active VOx species under the reaction conditions and/or during the regeneration process. Conversely, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 underwent structural changes throughout the DH experiment, leading to a progressive decline in the catalysts' activity from one cycle to the next.

Answer: The document does not provide specific details on the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It also lacks comparisons to traditional metal oxide supports, discussions on structural properties, catalytic behavior, advantages, limitations, reaction mechanisms, or the influence of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.
