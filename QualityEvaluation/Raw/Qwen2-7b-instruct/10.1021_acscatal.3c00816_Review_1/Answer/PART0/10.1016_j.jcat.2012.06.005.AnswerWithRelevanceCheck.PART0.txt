          [1] "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
          [2] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."
          [3] "In order to prove if catalyst reduction is mandatory for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were performed both with oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3)."
          [4] "In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles."
          [5] "An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that in contrast to PtSn/Al2O3, it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the DH reaction because oxidized and reduced VOx species are comparable in their activity and on-stream stability."

          The primary objective of the research was to investigate the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) without gas-phase oxygen, with a particular emphasis on long-term stability. Compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) pathway is more thermodynamically favorable, enabling higher conversion at lower temperatures. To determine if catalyst reduction is necessary for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts. In situ UV/Vis analysis in conjunction with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of used catalysts helped identify factors contributing to catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and over multiple cycles. A key advantage of VOx/MCM-41 is that it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the PDH reaction, as both oxidized and reduced VOx species exhibit similar activity and on-stream stability, unlike PtSn/Al2O3.

          研究的主要目标是探索高度分散的VOx物种在无气相氧情况下支持在介孔二氧化硅（MCM-41）上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH），特别强调长期稳定性。与非氧化性脱氢相比，氧化（ODH）路径从热力学角度来看更有吸引力，可以在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。为了确定催化剂还原是否对烯烃生产及在线稳定性至关重要，对氧化态和还原态催化剂进行了催化测试。就地紫外可见分析结合热程序氧化（TPO）帮助我们识别单个PDH周期和多个PDH/再生周期中催化剂失活的因素。VOx/MCM-41的一个关键优势是它不需要还原激活来催化PDH反应，因为氧化态和还原态的VOx物种在活动性和在线稳定性方面具有相似性，与PtSn/Al2O3不同。

          [1] "The propene STY values obtained over oxidized catalysts were in the range between 0.15 and ."
          [2] "As shown in Fig. 2 b, the propene selectivity was very similar over oxidized and reduced catalysts."
          [3] "For all the catalysts studied, the yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle decreased with time due to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition as will be demonstrated in Section 3.3."
          [4] "The TPO profiles of VOx/MCM-41 after the 1st cycle feature a single CO2 release event starting at 510 K and extending as a low flat shoulder to 880 K with the maximum at 670 K."
          [5] "Based on [33], this band in the oxidized catalyst is induced by nanocrystalline Cr2O3."

          The propene space-time yields (STY) obtained over oxidized catalysts ranged between 0.15 and . Over oxidized and reduced catalysts, propene selectivity was very similar as depicted in Figure 2b. For all the catalysts studied, the yield in the first dehydrogenation cycle decreased over time due to catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition, which will be detailed in Section 3.3. The TPO profiles of VOx/MCM-41 after the first cycle show a single CO2 release event beginning at 510 K and extending as a low flat shoulder up to 880 K with the peak at 670 K. According to [33], the band observed in the oxidized catalyst is attributed to the presence of nanocrystalline Cr2O3.

          [1] "VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration."

          [3] "VOx species remained unchanged over 4 DH cycles, while CrOx aggregated."

          Both oxidized and reduced forms of VOx/MCM-41 exhibited superior time-on-stream stability across all dehydrogenation (DH) cycles, with full recoverability of activity upon oxidative regeneration. The impact of hydrogen reduction on the catalyst's dehydrogenation properties was also explored. VOx species remained stable over four DH cycles, contrasting with the aggregation of CrOx species. From a thermodynamic perspective, the oxidative (ODH) pathway is more appealing than non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Vanadium-based catalysts were further examined for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

          [1] "The remarkable ability of VOx/MCM-41 to completely recover its DH activity and selectivity upon oxidative regeneration is explained by the fact that the nature of highly dispersed active VOx species was not changed under the reaction conditions and/or during the regeneration."
          [2] "Contrarily, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 were transformed in the course of the DH experiment resulting in a gradual loss of the catalysts activity from cycle to cycle."

      <English>
          The exceptional capability of VOx/MCM-41 to fully regain its dehydrogenation (DH) activity and selectivity after oxidative regeneration is attributed to the preservation of the nature of the highly dispersed active VOx species under the reaction conditions and/or during the regeneration process. Conversely, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 underwent structural changes throughout the DH experiment, leading to a progressive decline in the catalysts' activity from one cycle to the next.

      <Chinese>
          VOx/MCM-41在氧化再生后完全恢复其脱氢（DH）活性和选择性的非凡能力归因于在反应条件和/或再生过程中高度分散的活性VOx物种的性质得以保持。相反，CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3物种在DH实验过程中经历了结构变化，导致从一个周期到下一个周期催化剂活性逐渐下降。
