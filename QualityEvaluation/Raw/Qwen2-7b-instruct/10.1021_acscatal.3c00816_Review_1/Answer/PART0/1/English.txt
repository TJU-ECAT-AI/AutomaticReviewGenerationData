The primary objective of the research was to investigate the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) without gas-phase oxygen, with a particular emphasis on long-term stability. Compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) pathway is more thermodynamically favorable, enabling higher conversion at lower temperatures. To determine if catalyst reduction is necessary for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts. In situ UV/Vis analysis in conjunction with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of used catalysts helped identify factors contributing to catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and over multiple cycles. A key advantage of VOx/MCM-41 is that it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the PDH reaction, as both oxidized and reduced VOx species exhibit similar activity and on-stream stability, unlike PtSn/Al2O3.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was studied in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Their structural properties and catalytic behavior were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The analysis highlighted the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts. Factors affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, including lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, were also considered.
