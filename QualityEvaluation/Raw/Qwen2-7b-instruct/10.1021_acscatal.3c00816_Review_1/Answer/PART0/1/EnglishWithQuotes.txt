Compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) pathway is more thermodynamically favorable, enabling higher conversion at lower temperatures. To determine if catalyst reduction is necessary for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts. In situ UV/Vis analysis in conjunction with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of used catalysts helped identify factors contributing to catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and over multiple cycles. A key advantage of VOx/MCM-41 is that it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the PDH reaction, as both oxidized and reduced VOx species exhibit similar activity and on-stream stability, unlike PtSn/Al2O3.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005"},
