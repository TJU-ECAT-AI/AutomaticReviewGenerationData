The propene space-time yields (STY) obtained over oxidized catalysts ranged between 0.15 and . Over oxidized and reduced catalysts, propene selectivity was very similar as depicted in Figure 2b. For all the catalysts studied, the yield in the first dehydrogenation cycle decreased over time due to catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition, which will be detailed in Section 3.3. The TPO profiles of VOx/MCM-41 after the first cycle show a single CO2 release event beginning at 510 K and extending as a low flat shoulder up to 880 K with the peak at 670 K. According to [33], the band observed in the oxidized catalyst is attributed to the presence of nanocrystalline Cr2O3.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts demonstrated superior activity and stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Structural properties, such as lattice oxygen species and porosity, play a crucial role in determining the catalysts' catalytic behavior during PDH reactions. H2 pretreatment was identified as an effective method to prevent deactivation due to carbon deposition.
