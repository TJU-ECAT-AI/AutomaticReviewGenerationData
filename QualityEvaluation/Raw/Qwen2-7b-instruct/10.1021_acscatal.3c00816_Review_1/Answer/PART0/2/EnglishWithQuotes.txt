Over oxidized and reduced catalysts, propene selectivity was very similar as depicted in Figure 2b. For all the catalysts studied, the yield in the first dehydrogenation cycle decreased over time due to catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition, which will be detailed in Section 3.3. The TPO profiles of VOx/MCM-41 after the first cycle show a single CO2 release event beginning at 510 K and extending as a low flat shoulder up to 880 K with the peak at 670 K.
