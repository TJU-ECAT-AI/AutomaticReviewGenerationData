        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\], \[10.1021/acsami.0c22759\]. The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was studied in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports in terms of their structural properties and catalytic behavior, highlighting the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms associated with them. The factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment were considered in relation to their influence on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions.

        An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the PDH reaction, unlike PtSn/Al2O3, due to the comparable activity and on-stream stability of both oxidized and reduced VOx species. Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) pathway is more thermodynamically favorable, enabling higher conversion at lower temperatures. In order to prove if catalyst reduction is mandatory for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts. In situ UV/Vis analysis in conjunction with TPO of spent catalysts helped identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single PDH cycle and over several cycles.

        In the context of future research, there is an opportunity to explore the potential of emerging fields and innovative methodologies in the application of OMS catalysts for PDH reactions. Future endeavors might focus on refining catalyst design, enhancing stability, and optimizing the reaction conditions for improved efficiency and selectivity. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanism, and operational parameters in achieving optimal performance.

        The investigation of lattice oxygen species and the impact of H2 pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation offers insights into strategies for mitigating deactivation and improving catalyst longevity. These studies contribute to the broader understanding of how to effectively utilize OMS catalysts in PDH reactions, providing a foundation for further advancements in this field.

        研究了金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。这些催化剂与传统的金属氧化物支持进行了比较，探讨了它们的结构特性和催化行为，突出了优势、限制和反应机制。考虑了诸如晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素对催化剂性能和PDH反应中催化剂失活的影响。

        对于VOx/MCM-41而言，其无需还原激活即可催化PDH反应，这与PtSn/Al2O3不同，因为氧化态和还原态VOx物种在活性和在线稳定性方面具有相似性。与非氧化性脱氢相比，氧化（ODH）路径从热力学角度来看更具吸引力，能够在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。为了证明催化剂还原是否对于烯烃生成和在线稳定性是必要的，进行了使用氧化和还原催化剂的催化测试。就地UV/Vis分析结合TPO耗尽催化剂帮助识别单个PDH周期和多个PDH/再生周期内影响催化剂失活的因素。
