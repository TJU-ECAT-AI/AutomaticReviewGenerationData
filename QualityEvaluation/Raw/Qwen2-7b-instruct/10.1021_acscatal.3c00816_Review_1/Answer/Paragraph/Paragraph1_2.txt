        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\] and \[10.1021/acsami.0c22759\]. The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions have been extensively explored. Specifically, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts have been investigated, highlighting their structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts are thoroughly discussed. Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, such as lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment, are also analyzed.

        The performance of OMS catalysts has been found to be advantageous due to their unique mesoporous structure, which promotes better dispersion of active species like VOx and CrOx. This structure allows for enhanced accessibility to reactants and products, thereby improving conversion efficiency and selectivity. Moreover, these catalysts demonstrate high stability under operational conditions, particularly when considering long-term stability.

        The comparison with traditional metal oxide supports reveals several benefits of using MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts. These include improved activity, stability, and on-stream performance. The absence of a requirement for reductive activation for these catalysts, unlike PtSn/Al2O3, further adds to their practicality and efficiency. The lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the catalytic process, facilitating the reaction mechanism and influencing the overall performance.

        Hydrogen pretreatment is found to affect the catalyst's performance by altering its surface chemistry and structure. It can either enhance or inhibit the activity, depending on the specific conditions and the type of pretreatment used. Understanding this relationship is essential for optimizing the catalyst's performance in PDH reactions.

        The study also emphasizes the importance of analyzing catalyst deactivation mechanisms through techniques such as in situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with Thermal Programmed Oxidation (TPO) of spent catalysts. This approach helps in identifying the factors governing the catalyst's deactivation during the PDH cycle and over multiple regeneration cycles, providing insights into the catalyst's longevity and sustainability.

        An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is its ability to operate without requiring a reductive activation step, making it a promising alternative for PDH reactions. This characteristic is attributed to the similarity in activity and on-stream stability between oxidized and reduced VOx species, unlike traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3.

        In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, especially MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, show significant promise in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their superior structural properties, catalytic behavior, and advantageous reaction mechanisms. The incorporation of lattice oxygen species and the consideration of hydrogen pretreatment are critical factors in enhancing their performance. Future research could explore the integration of advanced materials and innovative synthesis methods to further improve the catalysts' efficiency and stability, addressing the challenges and limitations identified in current studies.
