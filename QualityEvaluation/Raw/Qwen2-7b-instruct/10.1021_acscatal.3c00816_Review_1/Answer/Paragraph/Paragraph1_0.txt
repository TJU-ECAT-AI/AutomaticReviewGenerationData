        The utilization of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been extensively explored for their potential in enhancing efficiency through the oxidative (ODH) pathway, which offers thermodynamic advantages over non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these OMS-supported catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports, highlighting their distinct advantages and limitations, along with the intricate reaction mechanisms involved. The factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, such as lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment, were meticulously analyzed.

        An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 over PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts is its ability to function effectively without requiring a reductive activation, due to the comparable activity and on-stream stability of both oxidized and reduced VOx species. This characteristic sets VOx/MCM-41 apart, offering a competitive edge in terms of catalyst longevity and operational efficiency.

        In situ UV/Vis analysis in conjunction with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of spent catalysts provided insights into the factors governing catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and over multiple cycles, revealing critical information for the development of more robust and sustainable catalyst systems.

        In the context of future research endeavors, the exploration of emerging fields and innovative methodologies could lead to the identification of new catalyst materials with enhanced performance and stability. Future studies might focus on optimizing the synthesis methods for MCM-41 and SBA-15, tailoring the support properties to better match the requirements of PDH reactions, and investigating the role of lattice oxygen species in promoting the deactivation process. The integration of advanced characterization techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), could provide deeper insights into the active sites and their evolution during the PDH process.

        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research efforts might concentrate on:
        - Enhancing the selectivity and yield of olefin products through the optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst composition.
        - Investigating the synergistic effects of combining different metal oxides on the surface of MCM-41 and SBA-15 to achieve improved catalytic performance.
        - Developing more efficient pretreatment strategies for the introduction of lattice oxygen species to boost the catalytic activity and stability.
        - Exploring the use of renewable feedstocks and the potential for upscaling the PDH process for industrial applications, considering environmental sustainability and economic feasibility.

        By addressing these areas of research, the scientific community can make significant strides towards the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly propane dehydrogenation processes, contributing to the advancement of the chemical industry and sustainable energy solutions.

        特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂的应用已经广泛探索，以利用氧化（ODH）路径的热力学优势，这比非氧化脱氢更具吸引力。这些OMS支持催化剂的结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物支持进行了比较，强调了它们的独特优势、限制以及复杂的反应机制。影响催化剂性能和PDH反应中催化剂失活的因素，如晶格氧物种和氢（H2）预处理，进行了细致的分析。

        VOx/MCM-41相对于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的优势在于无需进行还原激活即可有效运行，这是由于氧化和还原后的VOx物种在活性和在线稳定性方面表现出相似性。这一特点使VOx/MCM-41脱颖而出，在催化剂寿命和操作效率方面提供了竞争性优势。

        在线UV/Vis分析与热程序氧化（TPO）的耗尽催化剂结合使用，提供了关于单个PDH周期内和多个PDH/再生周期内的催化剂失活因素的见解，为开发更稳健和可持续的催化剂系统提供了关键信息。

        鉴于文件中讨论的进展，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会，未来的研究可能集中在：
