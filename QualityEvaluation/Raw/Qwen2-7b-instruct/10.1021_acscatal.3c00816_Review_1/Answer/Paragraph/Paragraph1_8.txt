        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\], \[10.1021/acsami.0c22759\], and others. The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, focusing on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, were thoroughly examined. The comparative analysis revealed the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms associated with these catalysts, providing insights into their structural properties and catalytic behavior when compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The study also emphasized the role of factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation during PDH reactions.
