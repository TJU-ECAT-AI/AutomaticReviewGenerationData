    "Summary": "Both review articles are of high quality, covering the application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions comprehensively. They share similar strengths in topic relevance, accuracy, innovation, organization, academic standards, and contribution to the field. However, neither article stands out significantly in any category, resulting in identical total scores. Both articles suggest new research directions but lack clarity in research methodology and display similar levels of writing quality. Practical application potential and feasibility of proposed suggestions are equally highlighted in both reviews. The limitations in critical thinking, specifically regarding the logic of argumentation and identification of research limitations, are also similar in both articles."
