        The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions have been extensively explored, particularly focusing on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts. This comparative analysis elucidates the unique advantages and limitations of these catalysts, their reaction mechanisms, and the challenges they face. The studies highlight the potential of OMS catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of PDH reactions through their distinct structural properties and catalytic behavior, offering a more thermodynamically favorable route compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

        The incorporation of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen pretreatment significantly influences the performance and deactivation of these catalysts during PDH reactions. Understanding these factors allows for the optimization of catalyst conditions, leading to improved stability and productivity. Moreover, the absence of a reductive activation step for VOx/MCM-41 is a notable advantage, making it a promising alternative to catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3.
