        The application, structure, and performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions have been extensively explored, particularly focusing on MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts. The comparative analysis of these catalysts against traditional metal oxide supports highlights their distinct advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. The factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, such as lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment, have been meticulously examined.

        The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these OMS-supported catalysts were found to be superior to traditional metal oxide supports. The oxidative (ODH) route for PDH reactions was deemed more thermodynamically favorable, allowing for higher conversion rates at lower temperatures compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. To ascertain whether catalyst reduction is essential for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were carried out with both oxidized and reduced catalysts. The in situ UV/Vis analysis combined with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of spent catalysts provided insights into the factors governing catalyst deactivation during a single PDH cycle and over multiple regeneration cycles.

        A notable advantage of VOx/MCM-41 is its ability to function effectively without requiring a reductive activation for catalyzing the PDH reaction. Unlike PtSn/Al2O3, both oxidized and reduced VOx species demonstrate comparable activity and on-stream stability. The flowing-air-induced transformation promoted the dispersion of the CrOx catalyst, enhancing its performance in propane dehydrogenation.

        In the integrative understanding and prospective outlook, we consider the advancements and findings detailed in the file. There exists an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in the realm of OMS catalysts for PDH reactions. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the catalyst design to improve selectivity, increasing the reaction rate, and mitigating deactivation mechanisms. Additionally, investigating the synergistic effects of combining different metal oxides on the OMS support could lead to the development of even more efficient catalysts.

        Taking into account the advancements and findings discussed in the file, we anticipate the exploration of emerging fields and innovative methodologies in this area. Future research efforts may concentrate on refining catalyst design to enhance selectivity, accelerating the reaction kinetics, and addressing deactivation mechanisms. Moreover, the investigation of the synergistic interactions between various metal oxides on the OMS support might pave the way for the creation of even more effective catalysts.

        对于金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用、结构和性能进行了广泛研究，特别是重点探讨了MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂。对这些催化剂与传统金属氧化物支持的比较分析揭示了它们的独特优势、局限性和反应机制。影响催化剂性能和PDH反应过程的几个关键因素，如晶格氧物种和氢气（H2）预处理，已进行了细致的考察。

        这些OMS支持的催化剂的结构特性和催化行为被发现优于传统的金属氧化物支持。与非氧化性脱氢相比，氧化（ODH）途径在热力学上更为有利，允许在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。为了确定催化剂还原是否对于烯烃生成和在线稳定性是必要的，进行了使用氧化和还原催化剂的催化测试。通过原位UV/Vis分析结合热程序氧化（TPO）分析了使用后的催化剂，以识别单个PDH周期和多个再生周期内催化剂失活的因素。

        VOx/MCM-41的一个显著优点是无需进行还原激活即可有效催化PDH反应。与PtSn/Al2O3不同，氧化和还原的VOx物种展现出相似的活性和在线稳定性。通过流动空气诱导的转变促进了CrOx催化剂的分散，从而提高了其在丙烷脱氢中的性能。
