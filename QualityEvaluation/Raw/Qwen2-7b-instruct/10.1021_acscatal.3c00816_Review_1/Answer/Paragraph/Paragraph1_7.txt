        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\] and \[10.1021/acsami.0c22759\]. The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was studied in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Their structural properties and catalytic behavior were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The analysis highlighted the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts. Factors affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, including lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, were also considered.

        An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the PDH reaction, as both oxidized and reduced VOx species exhibit similar activity and on-stream stability, unlike PtSn/Al2O3. The primary objective of the research was to investigate the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) for propane dehydrogenation without gas-phase oxygen, with a particular emphasis on long-term stability. Compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) pathway is more thermodynamically favorable, enabling higher conversion at lower temperatures.

        To determine if catalyst reduction is necessary for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts. In situ UV/Vis analysis in conjunction with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of used catalysts helped identify factors contributing to catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and over multiple cycles. 

        The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these OMS-supported catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. Traditional metal oxide supports often require reductive activation before use, which VOx/MCM-41 does not necessitate. This feature could lead to cost savings and process efficiency improvements.

        In the context of future research, there is an opportunity to explore the use of emerging technologies and methodologies to further optimize the performance of OMS catalysts. Potential areas for advancement might include the development of novel synthesis techniques for the creation of more stable and active catalysts, as well as the integration of advanced monitoring systems to enhance real-time control and optimization of PDH processes.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggests that the field of OMS catalysts for PDH reactions is poised for significant growth and innovation. By leveraging the unique properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15, researchers can develop more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable methods for propane dehydrogenation, which holds promise for the petrochemical industry and beyond.
        
        In summary, the application of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions presents a promising avenue for enhancing catalytic performance and process economics. The comparative analysis reveals the advantages of OMS-based catalysts over traditional metal oxide supports, especially in terms of activation requirements and stability. Future research efforts should focus on refining synthesis methods, improving catalyst stability, and developing advanced monitoring systems to optimize PDH processes. This will likely lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly dehydrogenation methods, contributing to advancements in the petrochemical industry and the broader chemical engineering sector.

        基于\[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]参考文献的深度分析。从\[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\]和\[10.1021/acsami.0c22759\]的参考文献中获得的综合理解。

        研究了特定于金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。它们的结构特性和催化行为与传统的金属氧化物支持进行了比较。分析强调了这些催化剂的优点、限制和反应机制。影响催化剂在PDH反应中性能和失活的因素，包括晶格氧物种和H2预处理，也被考虑在内。

        VOx/MCM-41的一个额外优势是，它不需要还原激活即可催化PDH反应，因为氧化和还原的VOx物种具有相似的活性和在线稳定性，这不同于PtSn/Al2O3。研究的主要目标是调查在无气相氧气的情况下使用高度分散的VOx物种支持在mesoporous silica（MCM-41）上的脱氢可能性，特别强调长期稳定性。与非氧化性脱氢相比，氧化（ODH）途径在热力学上更具吸引力，能够在较低温度下实现更高的转化率。

        为了确定是否需要催化剂减少以进行烯烃生产并保持在线稳定性，进行了使用氧化和还原催化剂的催化测试。原位UV/Vis分析结合热程序氧化（TPO）用于消耗催化剂，有助于识别导致单个PDH周期内和多个PDH/再生周期内的催化剂失活的因素。

        这些OMS支持的催化剂的结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物支持进行了比较。传统的金属氧化物支持通常需要还原激活才能使用，而VOx/MCM-41则不需要。这一特点可能导致成本节省和过程效率的提高。

        在未来研究的背景下，有机会探索使用新兴技术的方法来进一步优化OMS催化剂的性能。潜在的发展领域可能包括开发更稳定、活性更高的新型合成技术，以及集成先进的监控系统以增强实时控制和优化PDH流程。

        集成理解和前景展望表明，OMS催化剂在PDH反应中的应用为提高催化性能和过程经济性提供了有前景的途径。比较分析揭示了OMS基催化剂相对于传统金属氧化物支持的优点，尤其是在激活要求和稳定性方面的优势。未来研究应重点放在细化合成方法、提高催化剂稳定性以及发展高级监控系统以优化PDH流程上。这将很可能会导致更高效、环境友好的脱氢方法的发展，为石化工业乃至更广泛的化学工程领域带来进步。

        总之，金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用展现出增强催化性能和过程经济性的有前景的途径。比较分析强调了OMS基催化剂相对于传统金属氧化物支持的优点，特别是在激活需求和稳定性的方面。未来的研究努力应集中在细化合成方法、提高催化剂稳定性和发展高级监控系统以优化PDH流程上。这将很可能导致更有效、更环保的脱氢方法的发展，对石化行业乃至更广泛的化学工程领域产生积极影响。
