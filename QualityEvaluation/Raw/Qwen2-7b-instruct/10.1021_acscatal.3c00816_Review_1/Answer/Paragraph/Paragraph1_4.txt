            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\] and \[10.1021/acsami.0c22759\]. The investigation delved into the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) without gas-phase oxygen, with a particular emphasis on long-term stability. The oxidative (ODH) route was found to be more thermodynamically favorable, allowing for higher conversion at lower temperatures compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

            To assess the necessity of catalyst reduction for olefin production and on-stream stability, catalytic tests were conducted with both oxidized and reduced catalysts. In situ UV/Vis analysis in conjunction with thermal programmed oxidation (TPO) of spent catalysts revealed insights into factors governing catalyst deactivation within a single PDH cycle and over multiple cycles. A significant advantage of VOx/MCM-41 is its ability to catalyze the PDH reaction without requiring reductive activation, as both oxidized and reduced VOx species exhibit comparable activity and on-stream stability, contrasting with PtSn/Al2O3.

            The structural properties and catalytic behavior of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The analysis underscored the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts. Factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions, such as lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment, were also examined.

            An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is its superior stability under various operating conditions, which is attributed to the unique mesoporous structure of MCM-41 providing a stable support for the dispersed metal oxides. This feature facilitates the dispersion of metal species, enhancing the active surface area and promoting efficient conversion of propane to propylene.

            Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the synthesis of OMS catalysts with tailored pore structures to further enhance selectivity and efficiency. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of combining different metal oxides on the same OMS support could lead to the development of more robust and versatile catalysts.

            Future studies could also delve into the role of surface defects and their impact on the catalytic activity and stability of OMS catalysts. Investigating the dynamics of lattice oxygen species during the PDH reaction and how they interact with the metal oxides could provide new insights into catalyst design and optimization.

            In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, demonstrate promising potential for propane dehydrogenation reactions. Their structural properties, catalytic behavior, and performance improvements over traditional metal oxide supports offer a compelling case for their further exploration and development in the field of catalysis.

                    来自参考文献 \[10.1016/j.jcat.2012.06.005\] 的深入分析。从 \[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\] 和 \[10.1021/acsami.0c22759\] 中综合理解。研究探索了高度分散的 VOx 物种在无气体氧的情况下对丙烷脱氢（PDH）的潜力，特别强调长期稳定性。氧化（ODH）途径在热力学上更具吸引力，允许在较低温度下实现更高的转化率，相比非氧化脱氢。

                    为了评估催化剂还原对于烯烃生产及在线稳定性的必要性，进行了氧化态和还原态催化剂的催化测试。原位紫外/可见光分析与耗尽催化剂的热程序氧化（TPO）相结合，揭示了单个 PDH 循环和多个 PDH/再生循环内影响催化剂失活的因素。VOx/MCM-41 的显著优势在于其无需还原激活即可催化 PDH 反应的能力，因为氧化态和还原态 VOx 物种在活性和在线稳定性方面具有相似性，这与 PtSn/Al2O3 形成了对比。

                    特别是金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是 MCM-41 和 SBA-15 支持的 VOx 和 CrOx，与传统金属氧化物支持进行了结构特性和催化行为的比较。分析强调了这些催化剂的优点、限制和反应机制。影响 PDH 反应中催化剂性能和失活的因素，如晶格氧物种和氢（H2）预处理，也得到了考虑。

                    VOx/MCM-41 的额外优势在于其在各种操作条件下表现出的优越稳定性，这归因于 MCM-41 独特的微孔结构为分散的金属氧化物提供了稳定的支撑。这一特性促进了金属物种的分散，增加了活性表面积，并促进了丙烷向丙烯的有效转换。

                    考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来的研究努力可能集中在优化 OMS 催化剂的合成，以定制其孔结构，进一步提高选择性和效率。此外，探索不同金属氧化物在相同 OMS 支撑上的协同效应可能导致更强大和多用途催化剂的发展。

                    未来的研究也可以深入探讨表面缺陷及其对 OMS 催化剂活性和稳定性的影响。研究晶格氧物种在 PDH 反应中的动态作用以及它们与金属氧化物的相互作用可以提供关于催化剂设计和优化的新见解。

                    总结，金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是 MCM-41 和 SBA-15 支持的 VOx 和 CrOx，在丙烷脱氢反应中显示出有前景的潜力。它们的结构特性、催化行为和相对于传统金属氧化物支持的性能改进为其在催化领域的进一步探索和发展提供了有力的案例。
