[1] "The addition of the promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation."
[3] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions."
[4] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition."
[5] "FePt/SSF showed the highest level of coke deposition which was 5 times as many as Pt/SSF."
[6] "In addition, In was the unique promotor that was partially reduced, meaning that more oxygen vacancies could be generated during the reaction process."
[7] "All promoted catalysts showed higher initial propane consumption rates compared with the base Pt/SSF sample."
[8] "InPt/SSF showed its good ability in improving the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation."

1. The introduction of Ce, In, La, and Fe as promoters into the Pt/SSF sample significantly impacted the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
2. The lattice oxygen capacity, derived from hydrogen consumption in TPR measurements, played a crucial role in determining the initial and final rates of propane consumption and propylene generation, respectively.
3. The Ce and In promoters demonstrated exceptional capability in preventing the growth of Pt crystallites under reaction conditions.
4. The introduction of promoters did not enhance the catalyst's ability to resist coke deposition.
5. The FePt/SSF catalyst exhibited the highest level of coke deposition, being 5 times greater than the Pt/SSF catalyst.
6. In addition, In acted as a unique promoter that was partially reduced, allowing for the generation of more oxygen vacancies during the reaction process.
7. All promoted catalysts showed higher initial propane consumption rates compared to the base Pt/SSF catalyst.
8. The In promoted catalyst, InPt/SSF, displayed a superior ability to improve catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
