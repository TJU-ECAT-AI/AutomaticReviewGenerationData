[1] "The results showed that such a preparation procedure could efficiently enhance the interaction between the support and Pt, and compared with the sample where Pt and Sn were coimpregnated, the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation was therefore improved."
[2] "The introduction of transition metal (Zn), (38) alkaline metal (Na, K), (39,40) alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), (31,41,42) and rare earth metal (La, Ce), (43,44) etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously."
[3] "The redox property of catalysts was measured by TPR technique, and the results were reported in Figure 5. The reduction behaviors by hydrogen were quite different and depended on the promotors."
[4] "The introduction of promotor In made the reaction more selective to propylene, while the addition of Fe did not bring evident improvement on the propylene selectivity."
[5] "The best performance on catalytic stability was not obtained over the sample CePt/SSF which showed the best ability against coke deposition but over InPt/SSF which showed the moderate level of deposited coke and the maximum level of surface Pt species."
[6] "Fe promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involved most lattice oxygen which was directly linked to the initial conversion of propane by correlating the catalytic activity and the lattice oxygen capacity."
[7] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, although the Pt oxides were only partially reduced according to the combined findings from TPR, XPS, and XRD."

1. The preparation procedure enhanced the interaction between the support and Pt, resulting in improved catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation compared to coimpregnated samples.
2. Promoters like Zn, Na, K, Mg, Ca, La, and Ce were used to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn, adjusting the acid-base properties.
3. The reduction behaviors of the catalysts varied depending on the type of promoter.
4. The In promoter increased propylene selectivity while the Fe promoter did not significantly improve it.
5. The sample InPt/SSF, which showed moderate coke deposition and maximum surface Pt species, performed best in catalytic stability.
6. The FePt/SSF catalyst involved the highest amount of lattice oxygen, correlating to initial propane conversion.
7. The In promoter facilitated the formation of surface Pt oxides, their reduction, and stabilization under reaction conditions.
