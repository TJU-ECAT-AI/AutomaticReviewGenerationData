Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key insights. The use of MCM-41 and SBA-15 as supports for VOx and CrOx metal oxides enables the creation of highly active and stable catalysts. The mesoporous structures of MCM-41 and SBA-15 provide large surface areas and well-defined pore sizes, which are beneficial for PDH reactions.

The lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in determining the initial activity and final yield of propylene. The presence of lattice oxygen facilitates the activation of CH bonds in propane, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency. The introduction of promoters such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the catalysts leads to an increase in lattice oxygen, which improves the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation.

Promoters like Ce and In exhibit exceptional capabilities in preventing the growth of Pt crystallites, thereby maintaining a stable surface structure during PDH reactions. This is evidenced by XRD results showing a lack of crystal growth in CePt/SSF and InPt/SSF samples. In contrast, the introduction of promoters does not significantly impact the ability of the catalysts to resist coke deposition.

Among the promoters, In shows superior performance in promoting the reduction of Pt species and stabilizing the metallic Pt particles, contributing to higher propylene selectivity and enhanced catalytic stability. The In promoter forms a catalyst with a Pt-rich surface, which is advantageous for PDH reactions. The redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition exhibit integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability.

FePt/SSF displays the highest level of coke deposition, five times more than the Pt/SSF sample, while CePt/SSF shows the lowest level but still slightly higher than the pristine catalyst. The sintering of active phases and coke deposition are identified as the primary reasons for catalytic deactivation. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of OMS catalysts, particularly the role of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment, significantly influence their performance in PDH reactions. The optimized use of promoters, like In, can lead to improved catalytic stability and propylene selectivity.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能揭示了一些关键见解。使用MCM-41和SBA-15作为VOx和CrOx金属氧化物的支撑体，可以创造出高度活性和稳定的催化剂。MCM-41和SBA-15的多孔结构提供了大量的表面积和定义明确的孔径，这对PDH反应有利。

晶格氧物种在决定初始活性和最终丙烯生成率方面起着关键作用。晶格氧的存在促进了丙烷中CH键的活化，从而提高了催化效率。将铈、铟、镧和铁等促进剂引入催化剂中导致晶格氧量增加，从而提高初始丙烷消耗速率和最终丙烯生成速率。

铈和铟等促进剂显示出阻止铂晶体生长的非凡能力，从而维持稳定表面结构。这从XRD结果中得到证实，显示了CePt/SSF和InPt/SSF样品中没有晶体生长。相比之下，促进剂的引入并没有显著影响催化剂抵抗焦炭沉积的能力。

在所有促进剂中，铟显示出最佳性能，通过促进Pt物种的还原和稳定金属铂粒子，提高丙烯选择性和增强催化剂稳定性。铟促进剂形成一种铂富集表面的催化剂，这对于PDH反应非常有利。还原性、抗聚集能力和焦炭沉积抵抗性的集成效果在实现更好的催化稳定性方面发挥了作用。

FePt/SSF显示出最高的焦炭沉积水平，是Pt/SSF样本的五倍，而CePt/SSF显示出最低水平，但仍然略高于原始催化剂。活性相的烧结和焦炭沉积被确定为催化失活的主要原因。OMS催化剂的结构特性和催化行为，特别是晶格氧物种和H2预处理的作用，显著影响它们在PDH反应中的性能。优化促进剂的使用，如铟，可以带来改善的催化稳定性和丙烯选择性。
