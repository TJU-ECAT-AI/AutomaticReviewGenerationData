[1] "The addition of the promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation."
[3] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."
[4] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition. FePt/SSF showed the highest level of coke deposition which was 5 times as many as Pt/SSF."
[5] "In order to explore more information on the role of promotor and to understand well the key factors that could affect the catalytic stability, the change in crystallite size during the reaction determined by XRD, the number of surface Pt species associated with the TPR and XPS, the quantity of deposited coke tested by running the TG measurements in diluted oxygen over the spent samples, and the variation of propane conversion were gathered in Figure 15 for a comparison study."

1. The introduction of promoters such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the Pt/SSF sample significantly influenced the initial activity and catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
2. Lattice oxygen capacity, assessed through hydrogen consumption in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments, significantly impacted the initial propane consumption rate and final propylene generation rate.
3. Ce and In demonstrated exceptional capability in inhibiting the growth of Pt crystallites under reaction conditions, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. 
4. Despite the introduction of promoters, their effectiveness against coke deposition was limited. The FePt/SSF sample showed the highest level of coke deposition, five times greater than that of the pristine Pt/SSF.
5. To further investigate the role of promoters and key factors affecting catalytic stability, a comparative study was conducted. This included monitoring changes in Pt crystallite size during the reaction, the number of surface Pt species through temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), coke deposition quantified through thermogravimetric analysis (TG) in diluted oxygen over spent samples, and the variation in propane conversion.

1. 添加Ce、In、La和Fe等促进剂到纯Pt/SSF样品中，显著影响了丙烷脱氢反应的初始活性和催化稳定性。
2. 来自温度程序化减少（TPR）实验的氢消耗计算的晶格氧容量，在确定初始丙烷消耗速率和最终丙烯生成速率方面起着重要作用。
3. Ce和In在抑制Pt结晶体生长方面表现出极强的能力，在X射线衍射（XRD）结果中明显。
4. 尽管引入了促进剂，但它们在防止结焦沉积方面的效果有限。FePt/SSF样品显示出最高的结焦沉积，比原始Pt/SSF高五倍。
5. 为了进一步研究促进剂的作用和影响催化稳定性的关键因素，进行了一项比较研究。这包括监测反应期间Pt结晶体大小的变化，通过温度程序化减少（TPR）和X射线光电子谱（XPS）确定表面Pt物种的数量，通过在稀释氧气下对耗尽样品进行热重分析（TG）来量化沉积的焦炭量，以及监测丙烷转化率的变化。
