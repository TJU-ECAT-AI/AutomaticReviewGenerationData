[1] "Various characterization techniques were applied to detect the structural evolution, key solid property, coke deposition and to understand their influences on catalytic performances."
[2] "The introduction of transition metal (Zn), (38) alkaline metal (Na, K), (39,40) alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), (31,41,42) and rare earth metal (La, Ce), (43,44) etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously."
[3] "The redox property and the surface composition together with the lattice oxygen capacity of catalysts were significantly affected by the nature of promotors."
[4] "The results showed that such a preparation procedure could efficiently enhance the interaction between the support and Pt, and compared with the sample where Pt and Sn were coimpregnated, the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation was therefore improved."
[5] "It was obvious that the unpromoted Pt/SSF exhibited a continuous deactivation as the conversion lost by around 24% at the end, while for the Fe-, La-, and Ce-promoted catalysts, the stability was improved to different extent, but similar deactivation processes could be found."
[6] "On the contrast, the promotors Ce and In showed their excellent ability in stabilizing the crystallite of metallic as the size did not change at all, which supplied the reasonable explanation for the better stability on the two samples."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was thoroughly analyzed. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The use of promoters like Ce, In, La, and Fe was found to significantly enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn, tuning the acid-base property of the catalysts. The lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment were found to play crucial roles in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The introduction of promoters led to improved catalytic activity and stability. Among the promoted catalysts, those containing Ce and In showed exceptional stability due to their ability to stabilize the crystallite size of metallic Pt, reducing sintering and coke deposition. The redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition were found to be interrelated factors contributing to the catalytic stability.

对金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了全面分析。这些催化剂的结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物支持进行了比较。发现使用Ce、In、La、Fe等促动剂能显著增强Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，并调整催化剂的酸碱性。晶格氧物种和H2预处理被发现是影响催化剂性能和脱氢反应中催化剂失活的关键因素。引入促动剂导致催化活性和稳定性得到改善。在所有促进催化剂中，含Ce和In的催化剂表现出卓越的稳定性，这是由于它们能够稳定金属Pt的晶粒大小，减少聚集和焦炭沉积。红ox性质、抗聚集能力和抗焦炭沉积能力被认为是决定催化稳定性的综合因素。
