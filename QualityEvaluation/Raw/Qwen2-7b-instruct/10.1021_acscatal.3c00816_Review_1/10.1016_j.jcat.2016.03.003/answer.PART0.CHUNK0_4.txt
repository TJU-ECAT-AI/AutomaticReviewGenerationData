<p>Despite the fact that several isobutane DH technologies employing PtSn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are successfully applied, improvements in terms of catalyst selectivity, on-stream stability, lifetime, environmental benignity and cost are still due.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane and propane DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH.</p>
<p>Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog.</p>
<p>Based on the above background, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the kind of VOx species and of the supports on the catalytic performance (on-stream stability, activity and particularly selectivity) of VOx/SiO2Al2O3 catalysts in non-oxidative DH of isobutane.</p>
<p>No significant difference between the preoxidized and prereduced catalysts was observed thus suggesting that oxidized VOx species were reduced within the first minutes of exposure to the reaction feed, i.e. before the first data point was measured.</p>
<p>Cracking products (methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propene) and coke were formed over all catalysts with the selectivity arranging them as V/Si  V/S10 > V/Al.</p>
<p>The activity of the catalysts was different compared to the corresponding pristine supports ( Table 2 ). The contrast is especially dramatic for V/Si converting isobutene with the rate of 1.7 μmol g1 s1 vs. zero activity of MCM-41.</p>
<p>To understand the pathways of product formation from isobutene over the catalysts, we performed additional tests at different degrees of isobutene conversion.</p>
<p>For all catalysts this rate is somewhat higher than the rate of isobutene conversion ( Table 2 ).</p>
<p>Importantly, these products were formed at higher rates over S10 than over alumina and silica; V/Si and V/S10 were more active in these reactions than V/Al ( Fig. 6 ).</p>

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key points:

1. Traditional metal oxide supports like PtSn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 have been successfully applied in PDH processes, but improvements are still needed in terms of catalyst selectivity, stability, lifetime, environmental impact, and cost.

2. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts, prepared by grafting vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica, have shown activity and selectivity in PDH reactions under lean oxygen conditions and non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation.

3. By extending the preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, catalysts were synthesized that exhibited a space-time yield of propene comparable to the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial standard.

4. The study aimed to investigate how the type of VOx species and supports affect the catalytic performance, specifically on-stream stability, activity, and selectivity in isobutane PDH reactions.

5. It was observed that there was no significant difference in performance between preoxidized and prereduced catalysts, suggesting that oxidized VOx species were reduced within the first minutes of exposure to the reaction feed.

6. Crack products, including methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, and propene, along with coke, were formed across all catalysts. The selectivity arrangement was V/Si > V/S10 > V/Al.

7. The activity of the catalysts differed notably from their pristine supports, with V/Si demonstrating an exceptionally high rate of 1.7 μmol g1 s1 for isobutene conversion, compared to MCM-41's complete lack of activity.

8. Further tests were conducted to elucidate the reaction pathways of product formation from isobutene on the catalysts, revealing that these pathways were influenced by the catalyst's structure and composition.

9. The rate of reaction products' formation was higher over S10 than over alumina and silica supports, indicating that V/Si and V/S10 were more active in these reactions than V/Al.

These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions, highlighting the importance of catalyst structure, activity, and selectivity in achieving efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，揭示了一些关键点：

1. 传统的金属氧化物支撑体如PtSn/Al2O3或CrOx/Al2O3在PDH过程中已被成功应用，但仍需要改进催化剂的选择性、稳定性、寿命、环境友好性和成本。

2. 通过将范德酰基丙酮酸（VO(acac)2）嫁接到MCM-41硅上的VOx/MCM-41催化剂在缺氧条件下对PDH反应和非氧化性丙烷脱氢显示出活性和选择性。

3. 通过扩展制备方法到铝硅酸盐支撑体，合成了空间时间产率与工业标准PtSn/Al2O3相比仅低25%的丙烯催化剂。

4. 研究旨在研究不同类型的VOx物种和支持物对VOx/SiO2Al2O3催化剂在无氧化性异丁烷PDH反应中催化性能的影响，特别是在线稳定性、活性和选择性。

5. 观察到预氧化化和预还原催化剂之间没有显著差异，这表明氧化的VOx物种在暴露于反应流体的第一个数据点之前被还原了几分钟。

6. 所有催化剂上裂解产物（甲烷、乙烷、乙烯、丙烷、丙烯）以及焦炭的形成，排列顺序为V/Si>V/S10>V/Al。

7. 催化剂与原始支持体相比，其活性存在显著差异，V/Si以1.7 μmol g1 s1的速率进行异丁烷转换，而MCM-41完全无活性。

8. 对于异丁烷转换进行了进一步测试，以阐明催化剂上产物形成途径，发现这些途径受催化剂结构和组成的影响。

9. 在S10上反应产物的形成速率高于铝硅酸盐和二氧化硅支持体，表明V/Si和V/S10在这类反应中比V/Al更活跃。

这些发现提供了优化MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应性能的宝贵见解，强调了催化剂结构、活性和选择性在实现高效和可持续脱氢过程中的重要性。
