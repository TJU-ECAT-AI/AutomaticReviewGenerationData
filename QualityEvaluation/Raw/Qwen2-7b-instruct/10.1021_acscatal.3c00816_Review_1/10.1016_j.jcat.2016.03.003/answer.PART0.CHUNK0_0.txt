[1] "Despite the fact that several isobutane DH technologies employing PtSn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are successfully applied [1] , improvements in terms of catalyst selectivity, on-stream stability, lifetime, environmental benignity and cost are still due."
[2] "Commercial production of isobutene is based on steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of high-boiling oil residues. However, market-driven demand rose interest in on-purpose production of this commodity thus placing non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of isobutane to isobutene in focus as a prospective commercial process [1] ."
[3] "Despite its high on-stream stability, V/Si showed only around 48% initial (after ca. 0.5 h on stream) isobutene selectivity, which slightly increased with time on stream because the conversion of isobutane decreased ( Fig. 2 (b))."
[4] "However, it increased stronger with time on stream since the conversion decreased stronger."
[5] "In contrast to V/Si and V/S10, the conversion rate over V/S10 was lower than over the corresponding support."
[6] "Directing the focus to secondary reactions, we will begin the discussion with mechanistic aspects of cracking, coke formation and isomerization ( Scheme 1 )."
[7] "Importantly, these products were formed at higher rates over S10 than over alumina and silica; V/Si and V/S10 were more active in these reactions than V/Al ( Fig. 6 )."

Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was investigated. The study found that the degree of polymerization of VOx species and surface acidity were crucial catalyst properties influencing skeletal isomerization of propane and thereby affecting its selectivity. MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx exhibited different structural properties and catalytic behaviors compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The catalysts' performance and deactivation were influenced by factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment. Higher selectivity was achieved with catalysts that possessed higher surface acidity and a lower degree of VOx polymerization. H2 pretreatment helped in reducing the catalysts' activity, potentially delaying deactivation by preventing the formation of unwanted side-products. The study highlighted the importance of understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。将它们与传统金属氧化物支撑材料的结构特性和催化行为进行比较，讨论其优势、局限性以及反应机制。因素如晶格氧物种和H2预处理如何影响催化剂性能和PDH反应中的失活？

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中研究了金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂的性能。研究发现，VOx物种的聚合度和表面酸性是影响丙烷骨架异构化和选择性的关键催化剂特性。MCM-41和SBA-15上支持的VOx和CrOx与传统金属氧化物支撑材料表现出不同的结构特性和催化行为。催化剂的性能和失活受到诸如晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素的影响。通过更高的表面酸性和较低的VOx聚合度可以获得更高的选择性。H2预处理有助于降低催化剂活性，可能延迟失活，防止形成不需要的副产物。研究强调了理解催化剂结构与性能之间关系的重要性在PDH反应中。
