[1] "Despite the fact that several isobutane DH technologies employing PtSn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are successfully applied [1] , improvements in terms of catalyst selectivity, on-stream stability, lifetime, environmental benignity and cost are still due."
[2] "Commercial production of isobutene is based on steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of high-boiling oil residues. However, market-driven demand rose interest in on-purpose production of this commodity thus placing non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of isobutane to isobutene in focus as a prospective commercial process [1] ."
[3] "Despite its high on-stream stability, V/Si showed only around 48% initial (after ca. 0.5 h on stream) isobutene selectivity, which slightly increased with time on stream because the conversion of isobutane decreased ( Fig. 2 (b))."
[4] "However, it increased stronger with time on stream since the conversion decreased stronger."
[5] "In contrast to V/Si and V/S10, the conversion rate over V/S10 was lower than over the corresponding support."
[6] "Directing the focus to secondary reactions, we will begin the discussion with mechanistic aspects of cracking, coke formation and isomerization ( Scheme 1 )."
[7] "Importantly, these products were formed at higher rates over S10 than over alumina and silica; V/Si and V/S10 were more active in these reactions than V/Al ( Fig. 6 )."

Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was investigated. The study found that the degree of polymerization of VOx species and surface acidity were crucial catalyst properties influencing skeletal isomerization of propane and thereby affecting its selectivity. MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx exhibited different structural properties and catalytic behaviors compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The catalysts' performance and deactivation were influenced by factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment. Higher selectivity was achieved with catalysts that possessed higher surface acidity and a lower degree of VOx polymerization. H2 pretreatment helped in reducing the catalysts' activity, potentially delaying deactivation by preventing the formation of unwanted side-products. The study highlighted the importance of understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and performance in PDH reactions.

1. The highest initial conversion of about 52% was achieved over V/Si. It continuously decreased to around 25% during 27 h on stream. The conversion on all Al-containing catalysts was lower but passed through a maximum at early time on stream. After this initial phase, they also deactivated with a higher rate than V/Si as obvious from the descending parts of the conversion curves.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在流化初期，V/Si催化剂的最高转化率约为52%，随后在27小时内持续下降至约25%。所有含Al支持剂的催化剂的转化率较低，在流化初期达到峰值。之后，它们的活性以比V/Si更快的速度下降，从转换曲线的下降部分可以看出这一点。

2. In the isobutane DH reaction, the degree of polymerization of VOx species and surface acidity were found to be crucial catalyst properties influencing skeletal isomerization of isobutene and thereby indirectly affecting its selectivity.

2. 在异丁烷脱氢反应中，VOx物种的聚合度和表面酸性被认为是影响异丁烯骨架异构化以及进而间接影响其选择性的关键催化剂属性。

3. The catalyst performance in isobutane conversion was different compared to the corresponding pristine supports. The contrast was especially dramatic for V/Si converting isobutene with a rate of 1.7 μmol g1 s1 vs. zero activity of MCM-41. V/Al was also more active than pure Al2O3.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
3. 在异丁烷转化中，催化剂性能与原始支撑物相比有所不同。V/Si对异丁烷的转化速率达到了1.7 μmol g1 s1，而MCM-41则完全没有活性。相比之下，V/Al的活性也高于纯Al2O3。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. The balance between the pathways of coke formation was determined by the catalyst's ability to isomerize the target product isobutene to n-butenes. For V/Al, coke formation is mainly from isobutene on the same active sites responsible for isobutane DH, partially suppressing coke formation in the presence of isobutane. In contrast, the main gas-phase precursor of coke over the catalysts with SiO2 in the support is butadiene formed through dehydrogenation of n-butenes, which does not seem to be hindered by isobutane.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
4. 焦炭形成的平衡由催化剂将目标产物异丁烷异构化为异丁烯的能力决定。对于V/Al，焦炭形成主要来自在负责异丁烷DH的同一活性位点上的异丁烷，因此在存在异丁烷的情况下部分抑制了焦炭形成。相反，含SiO2的支撑催化剂上焦炭的主要气相前体是通过异丁烯脱氢形成的丁二烯，这种过程似乎不受异丁烷的影响。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was compared to traditional metal oxide supports. MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx catalysts showed higher selectivity and stability compared to CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog exhibited excellent performance. VOx/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrated the highest isobutene selectivity of around 85% at isobutane conversion of 50%, outperforming other catalysts. The characterization studies revealed that the isomerization reaction was catalyzed by both Lewis acidic sites of the support and VOx species. The study of activity and selectivity in isobutene and 1-butene conversion provided insights into the role of secondary reactions. Catalysts were found to undergo reduction within the first minutes of exposure to the reaction feed, indicating the presence of oxidized VOx species. Crackling products and coke were formed over all catalysts, with selectivities arranged as V/Si > V/S10 > V/Al. Surface VOx species were identified as the catalytically active components. The rate of n-butene conversion was higher than isobutene conversion, indicating more active catalytic sites. S10 showed higher activity in forming isobutene and n-butenes compared to alumina and silica, and was more active in isomerization reactions than V/Al. The study also explored the impact of the degree of polymerization of VOx species on isomerization activity and the role of acidic sites in determining catalyst performance.
