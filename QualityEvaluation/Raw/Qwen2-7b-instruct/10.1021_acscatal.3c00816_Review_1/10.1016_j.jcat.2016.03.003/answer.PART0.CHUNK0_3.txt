Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals that these materials offer unique structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The literature highlights the importance of lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment in influencing catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. The presence of lattice oxygen species on OMS supports is crucial for maintaining high activity and selectivity, while H2 pretreatment helps in stabilizing the catalysts against deactivation by removing any adsorbed oxygen species. This ensures better performance and longevity of the catalysts in PDH processes. The study emphasizes that the kind of VOx species and the supports play significant roles in determining the catalytic performance, particularly in terms of on-stream stability, activity, and selectivity. The comparison between VOx/MCM-41, VOx/SBA-15, and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts showcases the advantages and limitations of these materials in PDH reactions, highlighting their potential for improving the efficiency and sustainability of the process. The document also discusses the impact of different catalyst preparation methods on the performance of the materials, indicating that the grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate onto MCM-41 silica leads to catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The use of aluminosilicate supports in extending this preparation method has been shown to yield catalysts with comparable performance to industrial analogues, further emphasizing the versatility and effectiveness of OMS materials in PDH applications. Overall, the literature underscores the importance of understanding the structural and chemical properties of OMS catalysts and their role in facilitating efficient PDH reactions, thereby offering insights into optimizing catalyst design and operation for improved performance and economic benefits.
