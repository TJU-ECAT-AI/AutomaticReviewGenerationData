<p>Despite the fact that several isobutane DH technologies employing PtSn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are successfully applied [1] , improvements in terms of catalyst selectivity, on-stream stability, lifetime, environmental benignity and cost are still due.</p>
<p>Extending this preparation method to aluminosilicate supports, we obtained catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than measured on the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog [15] .</p>
<p>The highest selectivity to isobutene of around 85% at isobutane conversion of 50% was achieved over VOx/Al2O3, while all other catalysts were significantly less selective and performed similarly to each other.</p>
<p>Our characterization studies suggest that the above isomerization reaction is catalyzed by both, Lewis acidic sites of support and VOx species.</p>
<p>Isobutene is an important commodity chemical used as a feedstock for production of methyl-tert-butyl ether, methacrylate polymers, butyl rubber and polyisobutene.</p>
<p>Commercial production of isobutene is based on steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of high-boiling oil residues.</p>
<p>The literature on non-oxidative isobutane DH catalysts beyond industrially applied PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 is sparse but some alternatives have been studied in the past [1] .</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 prepared by grafting of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) onto MCM-41 silica was active and selective in isobutane [12] and propane [13] DH under O2-lean conditions as well as in non-oxidative propane DH [14] .</p>
<p>To understand the role of secondary reactions, we also investigated activity and selectivity of the catalysts and the corresponding pristine supports in isobutene and 1-butene conversion.</p>
<p>No significant difference between the preoxidized and prereduced catalysts was observed thus suggesting that oxidized VOx species were reduced within the first minutes of exposure to the reaction feed, i.e. before the first data point was measured.</p>
<p>Cracking products (methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propene) and coke were formed over all catalysts with the selectivity arranging them as V/Si  V/S10 > V/Al ( Fig. 3 ).</p>
<p>Since SiO2 was not active for isobutene conversion but V/Si converted this olefin, we can safely conclude that surface VOx are the catalytically active species.</p>
<p>For all catalysts this rate is somewhat higher than the rate of isobutene conversion ( Table 2 ).</p>
<p>Importantly, these products were formed at higher rates over S10 than over alumina and silica; V/Si and V/S10 were more active in these reactions than V/Al ( Fig. 6 ).</p>
<p>One can clearly see that the selectivity to isobutene over isolated VOx species was lower and decreased with rising isobutane conversion stronger than over their slightly polymerized counterparts.</p>

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions was compared to traditional metal oxide supports. MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx catalysts showed higher selectivity and stability compared to CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The catalysts with a space-time yield of propene only 25% lower than the PtSn/Al2O3 industrial analog exhibited excellent performance. VOx/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrated the highest isobutene selectivity of around 85% at isobutane conversion of 50%, outperforming other catalysts. The characterization studies revealed that the isomerization reaction was catalyzed by both Lewis acidic sites of the support and VOx species. The study of activity and selectivity in isobutene and 1-butene conversion provided insights into the role of secondary reactions. Catalysts were found to undergo reduction within the first minutes of exposure to the reaction feed, indicating the presence of oxidized VOx species. Crackling products and coke were formed over all catalysts, with selectivities arranged as V/Si > V/S10 > V/Al. Surface VOx species were identified as the catalytically active components. The rate of n-butene conversion was higher than isobutene conversion, indicating more active catalytic sites. S10 showed higher activity in forming isobutene and n-butenes compared to alumina and silica, and was more active in isomerization reactions than V/Al. The study also explored the impact of the degree of polymerization of VOx species on isomerization activity and the role of acidic sites in determining catalyst performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，与传统金属氧化物支持的催化剂进行了比较。MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx催化剂与CrOx/Al2O3催化剂相比，显示出更高的选择性和稳定性。空间时间产率仅为丙烯工业模拟物的25%的催化剂表现出了出色的性能。VOx/Al2O3催化剂在50%异丁烷转化时表现出最高的异丁烯选择性，约为85%，超过了其他催化剂。表征研究表明，异构化反应由支持物上的Lewis酸性位点和VOx物种共同催化。在异丁烯和1-丁烯转化的研究中，提供了对副反应作用的理解。发现催化剂在接触反应流体的第一分钟内经历了还原，表明存在氧化态VOx物种。裂解产物和焦炭在所有催化剂上形成，选择性排列为V/Si > V/S10 > V/Al。表面VOx物种被识别为催化活性成分。n-丁烯转化速率高于异丁烯转化，表明更活跃的催化位点。S10在形成异丁烯和n-丁烯方面比二氧化硅和氧化铝显示出更高活性，并且在异构化反应中比V/Al更活跃。研究还探讨了VOx物种聚合度对异构化活性的影响以及酸性位点在确定催化剂性能中的作用。
