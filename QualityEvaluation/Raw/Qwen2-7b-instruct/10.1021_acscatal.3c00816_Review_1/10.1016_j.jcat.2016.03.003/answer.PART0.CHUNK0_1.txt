<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The highest initial conversion of about 52% was achieved over V/Si. It continuously decreased to around 25% during 27 h on stream. The conversion on all Al-containing catalysts was lower but passed through a maximum at early time on stream. After this initial phase, they also deactivated with a higher rate than V/Si as obvious from the descending parts of the conversion curves.

1. 在流化初期，V/Si催化剂的最高转化率约为52%，随后在27小时内持续下降至约25%。所有含Al支持剂的催化剂的转化率较低，在流化初期达到峰值。之后，它们的活性以比V/Si更快的速度下降，从转换曲线的下降部分可以看出这一点。

2. In the isobutane DH reaction, the degree of polymerization of VOx species and surface acidity were found to be crucial catalyst properties influencing skeletal isomerization of isobutene and thereby indirectly affecting its selectivity.

2. 在异丁烷脱氢反应中，VOx物种的聚合度和表面酸性被认为是影响异丁烯骨架异构化以及进而间接影响其选择性的关键催化剂属性。

3. The catalyst performance in isobutane conversion was different compared to the corresponding pristine supports. The contrast was especially dramatic for V/Si converting isobutene with a rate of 1.7 μmol g1 s1 vs. zero activity of MCM-41. V/Al was also more active than pure Al2O3.

3. 在异丁烷转化中，催化剂性能与原始支撑物相比有所不同。V/Si对异丁烷的转化速率达到了1.7 μmol g1 s1，而MCM-41则完全没有活性。相比之下，V/Al的活性也高于纯Al2O3。

4. The balance between the pathways of coke formation was determined by the catalyst's ability to isomerize the target product isobutene to n-butenes. For V/Al, coke formation is mainly from isobutene on the same active sites responsible for isobutane DH, partially suppressing coke formation in the presence of isobutane. In contrast, the main gas-phase precursor of coke over the catalysts with SiO2 in the support is butadiene formed through dehydrogenation of n-butenes, which does not seem to be hindered by isobutane.

4. 焦炭形成的平衡由催化剂将目标产物异丁烷异构化为异丁烯的能力决定。对于V/Al，焦炭形成主要来自在负责异丁烷DH的同一活性位点上的异丁烷，因此在存在异丁烷的情况下部分抑制了焦炭形成。相反，含SiO2的支撑催化剂上焦炭的主要气相前体是通过异丁烯脱氢形成的丁二烯，这种过程似乎不受异丁烷的影响。
