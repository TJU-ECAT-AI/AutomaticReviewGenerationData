<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study compared these catalysts' structural properties and catalytic behavior against traditional metal oxide supports, exploring their advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. Key factors influencing catalyst performance and deactivation included lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment.
