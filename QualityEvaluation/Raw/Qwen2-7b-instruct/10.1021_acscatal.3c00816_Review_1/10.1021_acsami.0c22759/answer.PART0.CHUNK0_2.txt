The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were compared to traditional metal oxide supports regarding their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The study discussed the advantages and limitations of these catalysts along with the reaction mechanisms involved. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment were found to significantly impact catalyst performance and deactivation during PDH reactions.
