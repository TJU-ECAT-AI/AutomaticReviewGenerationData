<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported with VOx and CrOx, was analyzed in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts were compared against traditional metal oxide supports in terms of their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The study highlighted the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms associated with these catalysts. Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment were discussed as factors influencing the catalyst's performance and deactivation during PDH reactions.
