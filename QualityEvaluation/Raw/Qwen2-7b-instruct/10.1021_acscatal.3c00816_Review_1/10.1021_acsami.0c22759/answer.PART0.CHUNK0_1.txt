<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported with VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is analyzed. These catalysts' structural properties and catalytic behavior are compared to traditional metal oxide supports. The study highlights the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms associated with these catalysts. The influence of lattice oxygen species and hydrogen (H2) pretreatment on catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions is also discussed.
