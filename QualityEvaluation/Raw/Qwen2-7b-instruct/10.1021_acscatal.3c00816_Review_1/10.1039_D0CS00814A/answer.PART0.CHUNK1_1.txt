Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, exhibit different dehydrogenation active sites compared to traditional metal oxide supports. For GaOx-based catalysts, the structure of Ga species significantly affects the activity in PDH reactions. For VOx-based catalysts, the presence of various VO bonds leads to different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers. The effectiveness of CO2 cofeeding in promoting PDH reactions depends on the type of support and the basicity of its surface. Incorporating heterogeneous metals into metal oxides can enhance their electronic, optical, and catalytic performance. The active sites in doped metal oxides can be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself. Indium (In)-hydride species supported by chabazite (CHA) zeolites can be formed through H2 pretreatment, indicating their potential role in PDH reactions.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in determining the performance and deactivation of metal oxide-based catalysts in PDH reactions. Factors such as the basicity of the support surface can influence the adsorption of CO2, affecting its ability to promote RWGS and reducing the risk of CO2 irreversibly adsorbing and poisoning the support sites. Doping metal oxides with heterogenous metals can effectively tune their electronic properties, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The presence of dopants can alter the structure and functionality of the catalyst surface, influencing the catalytic behavior in PDH reactions. The formation of In-hydride species supported by chabazite zeolites highlights the potential of using these materials in catalytic processes, including PDH reactions.

The introduction of metal-ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) catalysts, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15, into PDH reactions offers advantages over traditional metal oxide supports. These OMS catalysts, particularly those supported with VOx and CrOx, display distinct structural properties and catalytic behavior, which can be advantageous in certain reaction conditions. The structural properties of GaOx-based catalysts are strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species, while VOx-based catalysts exhibit varying CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers due to their different VO bond configurations. The effectiveness of CO2 cofeeding in promoting PDH reactions is influenced by the support type and the basicity of its surface. Doping metal oxides with heterogenous metals can enhance their electronic, optical, and catalytic performance, with the active sites potentially being either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself. The formation of indium (In)-hydride species supported by chabazite (CHA) zeolites after H2 pretreatment highlights their potential role in PDH reactions.

Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment significantly influence the performance and deactivation of metal oxide-based catalysts in PDH reactions. The lattice oxygen species determine the surface reactivity and the propensity for deactivation during the PDH process. The basicity of the support surface affects the adsorption of CO2, impacting its ability to promote RWGS and reducing the risk of CO2 irreversibly adsorbing and poisoning the support sites. Doping metal oxides with heterogenous metals can effectively tune their electronic properties, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The presence of dopants alters the structure and functionality of the catalyst surface, influencing the catalytic behavior in PDH reactions. The formation of In-hydride species supported by chabazite zeolites indicates their potential for use in catalytic processes, including PDH reactions.
