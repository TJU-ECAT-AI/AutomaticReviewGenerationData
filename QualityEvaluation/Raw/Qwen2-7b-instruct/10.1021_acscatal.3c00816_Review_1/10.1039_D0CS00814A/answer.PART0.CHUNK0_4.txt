Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals distinct advantages and limitations. These catalysts offer unique structural properties that enhance their catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

For CrOx-supported catalysts, the lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. These species lower the activation barrier for hydrogen and propylene formation, contributing to their high reactivity. However, the low stability of CrOx-based catalysts is a limitation, characterized by a deactivation rate of 0.5 h^-1, leading to rapid deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration.

VOx-supported catalysts, on the other hand, exhibit a complex mixture of V species (V5+, V4+, V3+, isolated V, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5). Despite their high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared to CrOx-based catalysts, the precise role of these species in propane activation and selective propylene production remains unclear. This uncertainty hinders the optimization of VOx-supported catalysts for PDH reactions.

Ga2O3-supported catalysts, particularly when supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15, leverage the Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. The monoclinic structure of β-Ga2O3, with evenly distributed Ga3+ ions, facilitates the formation of a large number of weak acid sites, enhancing its catalytic activity. H2 pretreatment further promotes the formation of GaH species, which are more active than H+ and Ga+ sites, thereby improving catalyst performance.

However, GaOx-based catalysts face significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, necessitating controlled regeneration strategies to maintain their performance. The lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment are crucial factors in determining the catalytic behavior and deactivation in PDH reactions.

In the case of ZrO2-based catalysts, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) cations can be significantly tuned by altering the particle size and crystalline phase. Doping and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere generate Zrcus sites, increasing dehydrogenation activity. Yet, over-reduction must be carefully managed to prevent blockage of hydrogen recombination sites, impacting catalyst performance.

Overall, while MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, as well as GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, exhibit promising activity and selectivity in PDH reactions, their performance is influenced by factors such as lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, and the management of sintering and deactivation during regeneration. Optimizing these catalysts requires a deeper understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms and the careful control of catalyst preparation and regeneration processes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，展现出独特的结构特性和催化行为，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比。这些催化剂提供了增强其催化性能的独特结构特性。

对于CrOx基催化剂，晶格氧物种在PDH反应机制中扮演着关键角色。这些物种降低了氢和丙烯形成时的活化能垒，从而提高了它们的高活性。然而，CrOx基催化剂的低稳定性是一个限制因素，其失活率为0.5 h^-1，导致快速失活并需要频繁再生。

VOx基催化剂表现出复杂的V物种混合（V5+、V4+、V3+、孤立的V、寡聚的Vn+和结晶的V2O5）。尽管它们的高活性和抑制失活率与CrOx基催化剂相比优于CrOx基催化剂，但这些物种在丙烷激活和选择性丙烯生产的具体作用仍然不清楚。这种不确定性阻碍了对VOx基催化剂的优化以适应PDH反应。

Ga2O3支持的催化剂，特别是当支持在MCM-41和SBA-15上时，利用了由协调不饱和Ga3+离子提供的Lewis酸位点。β-Ga2O3的单斜结构，其中Ga3+离子均匀分布在八面体和四面体上，可以提供大量较弱的酸位，从而增强其催化活性。H2预处理进一步促进了GaH物种的形成，这些物种比H+和Ga+位点更活跃，从而改善了催化剂性能。

然而，GaOx基催化剂在连续再生操作期间面临严重的烧结问题，需要采取控制再生策略来维持其性能。晶格氧物种和H2预处理是确定PDH反应中催化剂行为和失活的关键因素。

至于ZrO2基催化剂，在改变颗粒大小和晶体相的情况下，可以通过掺杂和使用还原气氛生成Zrcus位点，显著调节Zrcus位点的数量。这增加了脱氢活性。然而，过度还原必须谨慎管理，以防止氢重组位点的堵塞，影响催化剂性能。

综上所述，尽管MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂以及GaOx和ZrO2基催化剂在PDH反应中显示出有希望的活性和选择性，但它们的性能受到晶格氧物种、H2预处理和再生过程中防止烧结和失活的影响。为了优化这些催化剂，需要深入了解其基本反应机制，并仔细控制催化剂制备和再生过程。
