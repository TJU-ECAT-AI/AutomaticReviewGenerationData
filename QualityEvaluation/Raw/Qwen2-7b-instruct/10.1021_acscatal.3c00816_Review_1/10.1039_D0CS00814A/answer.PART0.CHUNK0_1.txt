[1] "Comparatively, a supported vanadium oxide catalyst is expected to be used for PDH."
[2] "Similar to CrOx-based catalysts, carbon deposition is the main reason for deactivation of VOx-based catalysts, which is intimately related to the dispersion of VOx species."
[3] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."
[4] "In addition, H2 pretreatment can promote the formation of GaH species, which are more active than H+ sites and Ga+ sites."
[5] "For example, as for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site."

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports offer a more uniform pore size distribution compared to traditional metal oxide supports. This feature enhances the dispersion of metal particles, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the activity of CrOx-supported catalysts. They assist in the activation of propane molecules by lowering the activation barrier for hydrogen and propylene formation. H2 pretreatment is a technique that facilitates the formation of GaH species on GaOx-based catalysts, which are more active than hydrogen or Ga+ sites. This enhances the catalytic performance of GaOx catalysts in PDH reactions.

The H2 pretreatment process also aids in the recovery of gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species on Pt-modified GaOx catalysts. This improves the activity of these catalysts in PDH reactions. However, the continuous regeneration process of ZrO2-based catalysts leads to significant sintering, which affects their performance. Controlled regeneration methods are required to maintain their activity.

In summary, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports offer advantages in terms of improved dispersion and enhanced catalytic activity in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment are key factors that influence the performance of CrOx, GaOx, and ZrO2-based catalysts. However, challenges remain in maintaining the activity of ZrO2-based catalysts due to sintering during continuous regeneration processes.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到其结构特性和催化行为的影响。MCM-41和SBA-15支持提供了更均匀的孔径分布，与传统金属氧化物支持相比，这提高了金属颗粒的分散性，从而在PDH反应中提高了催化活性和选择性。

CrOx支持的催化剂中的晶格氧物种起着关键作用。它们通过降低氢和丙烯形成激活的激活壁垒来帮助丙烷分子的激活。通过H2预处理，可以在GaOx基催化剂上促进GaH物种的形成，这些物种比氢或Ga+物种更为活跃。这增强了GaOx催化剂在PDH反应中的催化性能。

H2预处理过程也有助于恢复Pt修改的GaOx催化剂上的镓化氢和/或羟基物种。这提高了这些催化剂在PDH反应中的活性。然而，ZrO2基催化剂的连续再生过程会导致显著的烧结，影响其性能。需要控制再生方法以维持其活性。

综上所述，MCM-41和SBA-15支持提供优势，即提高分散性和增强PDH反应中的催化活性。晶格氧物种和H2预处理是影响CrOx、GaOx和ZrO2基催化剂性能的关键因素。然而，保持ZrO2基催化剂活性的挑战在于连续再生过程中由于烧结而引起的性能下降。
