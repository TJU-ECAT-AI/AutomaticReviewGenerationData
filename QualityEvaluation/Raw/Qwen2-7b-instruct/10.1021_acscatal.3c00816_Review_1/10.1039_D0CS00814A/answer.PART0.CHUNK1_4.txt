Analyze the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compare their structural properties and catalytic behavior to traditional metal oxide supports, discussing the advantages, limitations, and reaction mechanisms. How do factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment influence catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions?

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15, support VOx and CrOx to perform Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials have unique structural properties compared to traditional metal oxide supports. VOx and CrOx catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 display different catalytic behaviors due to their distinct structures and coordination environments. 

VOx-based catalysts have different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers depending on their structure and coordination environments. Factors such as lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in influencing the catalytic performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. For instance, lattice oxygen can help in reducing the coke formation and promoting the stability of the catalyst. 

CrOx-based catalysts exhibit activity primarily through unsaturated and/or clustered Cr3+ sites, which are considered the active sites. The dehydrogenation reaction mechanism over these sites involves the activation of propane and the formation of propylene. 

In comparison, GaOx-based catalysts show strong dependence on the structure of Ga species for their activity in PDH reactions. GaOx catalysts have different dehydrogenation active sites compared to CrOx and VOx catalysts. 

H2 pretreatment is a critical factor affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It helps in tuning the surface properties, such as the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups, which in turn affects the desorption barrier of propylene and the overall selectivity of the catalyst. 

In conclusion, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts offer advantages in terms of their structured environments, which can modulate the catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The presence of lattice oxygen species and the effect of H2 pretreatment on the surface chemistry are crucial for controlling the deactivation mechanisms and improving the overall performance of these catalysts.

分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。将这些材料与传统金属氧化物支持进行比较，讨论它们的结构特性和催化行为，并探讨诸如晶格氧物种和H2预处理等因素如何影响催化剂性能和PDH反应中的失活。

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15，支持VOx和CrOx执行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。这些材料的结构特性与传统金属氧化物支持相比具有独特性。VOx和CrOx催化剂在MCM-41和SBA-15上显示出不同的催化行为，由于它们的结构和配位环境不同。

VOx基催化剂根据其结构和配位环境的不同，有不同的CH激活和丙烯脱除能垒。晶格氧物种是影响PDH反应中催化剂性能和失活的关键因素之一。

CrOx基催化剂通过孤立的不饱和或簇化的Cr3+位点表现出活性，被认为是活性位点。这些位点上的脱氢化反应机制涉及丙烷的激活和丙烯的形成。

相比之下，GaOx基催化剂的活性主要依赖于Ga物种的结构。GaOx催化剂在其表面上有不同类型的活性位点，与CrOx和VOx催化剂不同。

H2预处理是影响催化剂性能和PDH反应中失活的关键因素。它有助于调节表面性质，如表面羟基浓度，从而影响丙烯的脱除屏障和催化剂的整体选择性。

总之，MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中提供了优势，因为它们的结构环境可以调节催化活性和选择性。晶格氧物种的存在以及H2预处理对表面化学的影响对于控制催化剂的失活机制并提高整体性能至关重要。
