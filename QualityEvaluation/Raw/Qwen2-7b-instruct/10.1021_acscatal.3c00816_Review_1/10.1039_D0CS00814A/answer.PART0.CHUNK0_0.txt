The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior. These materials offer advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their ordered mesoporous structure, which facilitates better control over the surface area and pore size, enhancing the dispersion of active metal species. This leads to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

In terms of lattice oxygen species, the presence of lattice oxygen in CrOx-based catalysts plays a crucial role in activating propane CH bonds. It lowers the activation energy for H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8, contributing to the overall catalytic activity. However, these lattice oxygen species are susceptible to loss under reaction conditions, which can result in rapid deactivation.

For VOx-based catalysts, the nature of active species is closely tied to the valence state of vanadium. V5+, V4+, and V3+ coexist, with V3+ ions being identified as the most active sites for propane dehydrogenation. H2 pretreatment is an effective method for generating more active sites, as it promotes the formation of GaH species, which are more active than H+ and Ga+ sites.

In the case of GaOx-based catalysts, the active site is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. β-Ga2O3 shows high activity due to its monoclinic structure, which allows for the even distribution of Ga3+ ions, providing a large number of weak acid sites. DFT calculations elucidate the activation mechanism, involving the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, followed by the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group.

The addition of noble metals, such as Pt or Rh, can significantly enhance the activity and stability of GaOx-based catalysts. Pt modifies the GaOx surface, facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. Similarly, Rh nanoclusters can increase the reducibility of zirconia, promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in the PDH reaction.

H2 pretreatment is a critical factor affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It helps in generating more active sites, such as GaH species, which are more active than H+ and Ga+ sites. This process can also tune the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated sites, thereby influencing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，受到其独特结构特性和催化行为的影响。与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，这些材料提供了优势，因为它们具有有序的介孔结构，可以更好地控制表面积和孔径大小，从而提高活性金属物种的分散度。这导致了更好的催化活性和选择性。

关于晶格氧物种，在CrOx基催化剂中，晶格氧对激活丙烷CH键起着关键作用。它降低了H2和C3H6从C3H8形成所需的活化能，从而促进了整体催化活性。然而，这些晶格氧物种在反应条件下容易损失，从而导致快速失活。

对于VOx基催化剂，活性物种的存在状态与钒的价态密切相关。V5+、V4+和V3+共存，其中V3+离子被确认为丙烷脱氢化过程中最活跃的位点。氢气预处理是一种有效的方法来生成更多活性位点，因为它促进了GaH物种的形成，这些物种比H+和Ga+位点更活跃。

对于GaOx基催化剂，活性位点是通过配位不饱和Ga3+提供的Lewis酸位。β-Ga2O3表现出高活性，因为它的单斜结构允许Ga3+离子均匀分布在八面体和四面体上，提供了大量弱酸位点。第一性原理计算揭示了激活机制，涉及丙烷分子中一个氢原子的丢失以形成丙基组分和羟基组分，随后是β-H的去除以形成另一个羟基组分。

添加贵金属，如Pt或Rh，可以显著增强GaOx基催化剂的活性和稳定性。Pt修改了GaOx表面，促进了氢的脱附并恢复了镓氢化合物和/或羟基物种。同样，Rh纳米簇可以增加二氧化锆的可还原性，促进氢的脱附并降低PDH反应的能量壁垒。

氢气预处理是影响催化剂性能和PDH反应中失活的关键因素。它可以生成更活跃的位点，如GaH物种，这些物种比H+和Ga+位点更活跃。这个过程还可以调节配位不饱和位点的浓度，从而影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。
