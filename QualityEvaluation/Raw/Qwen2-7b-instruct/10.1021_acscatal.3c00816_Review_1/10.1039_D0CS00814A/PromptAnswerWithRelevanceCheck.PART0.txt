Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals their unique structural properties compared to traditional metal oxide supports. MCM-41 and SBA-15, two popular mesoporous silicas, are often used as supports for VOx and CrOx catalysts. These materials offer enhanced surface area and controlled pore size, which can improve the dispersion of active metal species and thus catalytic activity.

MCM-41, a member of the MCM family, is known for its cubic structure with well-defined channels. It allows for the precise control of pore size, which can influence the catalytic behavior of the supported metal oxides. SBA-15, on the other hand, features a high surface area with a narrow pore width, providing a suitable environment for the stabilization of metal nanoparticles and the promotion of surface reactions.

In comparison to traditional metal oxide supports, mesoporous silica supports can lead to better selectivity and stability in PDH reactions. The lattice oxygen species on the surface of these supports can play a critical role in the activation of the propane molecule, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The high surface area and ordered pore structure of MCM-41 and SBA-15 can also contribute to the dispersion of metal species, reducing agglomeration and improving the catalyst's longevity.

However, the performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment. Lattice oxygen can participate in the activation of the propane molecule, affecting the dehydrogenation pathway and selectivity. H2 pretreatment can alter the surface chemistry of the catalyst, influencing the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, and thus impacting the overall catalytic performance. Proper pretreatment conditions can optimize the catalyst's activity and stability, enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency.

Despite these advantages, the complex structures and pretreatment requirements of metal oxides can make it challenging to identify the true active sites under PDH reaction conditions. This necessitates the use of advanced characterization techniques, such as operando/in situ methods, to gain insights into the nature of the active sites and their behavior during the reaction.

In conclusion, Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, offer distinct structural properties that can enhance the performance of PDH reactions. Factors such as lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment can significantly influence their catalytic behavior, highlighting the importance of careful optimization of these conditions to achieve optimal performance.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，揭示了它们与传统金属氧化物支撑材料相比的独特结构特性。MCM-41和SBA-15两种流行的介孔硅通常是用于支持VOx和CrOx催化剂的材料。这些材料提供了增强的表面积和可控的孔径大小，这可以提高活性金属物种的分散性和催化活性。

MCM-41，属于MCM家族的一员，以其立方结构和明确的通道而闻名。它允许对孔径大小进行精确控制，这可以影响所支持金属氧化物的催化行为。相比之下，SBA-15具有高表面积和狭窄孔径宽度的特点，为金属纳米粒子的稳定化和表面反应的促进提供了一个合适环境。

与传统的金属氧化物支撑材料相比，介孔硅支撑材料在PDH反应中通常能带来更好的选择性和稳定性。这些材料的表面氧原子物种可以在激活丙烷分子中发挥关键作用，促进脱氢过程。MCM-41和SBA-15的高表面积和有序孔结构也可以通过分散金属物种来减少聚集现象，从而延长催化剂的使用寿命。

然而，这些催化剂的性能受到诸如表面氧物种和H2预处理等因素的影响。表面氧可以参与丙烷分子的激活，影响脱氢路径和选择性。适当的预处理条件可以优化催化剂的活性和稳定性，从而提高脱氢效率。

尽管存在这些优势，金属氧化物的复杂结构和预处理要求使得在PDH反应条件下确定真正活性位点变得具有挑战性。这需要使用先进的表征技术，如原位/实时方法，以深入了解活性位点的性质及其在反应过程中的行为。

综上所述，金属有序介孔二氧化硅催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，提供了独特结构特性，可以增强PDH反应的性能。诸如表面氧物种和H2预处理等因素可以显著影响其催化行为，强调了优化这些条件以实现最佳性能的重要性。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior. These materials offer advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their ordered mesoporous structure, which facilitates better control over the surface area and pore size, enhancing the dispersion of active metal species. This leads to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

In terms of lattice oxygen species, the presence of lattice oxygen in CrOx-based catalysts plays a crucial role in activating propane CH bonds. It lowers the activation energy for H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8, contributing to the overall catalytic activity. However, these lattice oxygen species are susceptible to loss under reaction conditions, which can result in rapid deactivation.

For VOx-based catalysts, the nature of active species is closely tied to the valence state of vanadium. V5+, V4+, and V3+ coexist, with V3+ ions being identified as the most active sites for propane dehydrogenation. H2 pretreatment is an effective method for generating more active sites, as it promotes the formation of GaH species, which are more active than H+ and Ga+ sites.

In the case of GaOx-based catalysts, the active site is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. β-Ga2O3 shows high activity due to its monoclinic structure, which allows for the even distribution of Ga3+ ions, providing a large number of weak acid sites. DFT calculations elucidate the activation mechanism, involving the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, followed by the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group.

The addition of noble metals, such as Pt or Rh, can significantly enhance the activity and stability of GaOx-based catalysts. Pt modifies the GaOx surface, facilitating hydrogen desorption and recovering gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species. Similarly, Rh nanoclusters can increase the reducibility of zirconia, promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in the PDH reaction.

H2 pretreatment is a critical factor affecting catalyst performance and deactivation in PDH reactions. It helps in generating more active sites, such as GaH species, which are more active than H+ and Ga+ sites. This process can also tune the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated sites, thereby influencing the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，受到其独特结构特性和催化行为的影响。与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，这些材料提供了优势，因为它们具有有序的介孔结构，可以更好地控制表面积和孔径大小，从而提高活性金属物种的分散度。这导致了更好的催化活性和选择性。

关于晶格氧物种，在CrOx基催化剂中，晶格氧对激活丙烷CH键起着关键作用。它降低了H2和C3H6从C3H8形成所需的活化能，从而促进了整体催化活性。然而，这些晶格氧物种在反应条件下容易损失，从而导致快速失活。

对于VOx基催化剂，活性物种的存在状态与钒的价态密切相关。V5+、V4+和V3+共存，其中V3+离子被确认为丙烷脱氢化过程中最活跃的位点。氢气预处理是一种有效的方法来生成更多活性位点，因为它促进了GaH物种的形成，这些物种比H+和Ga+位点更活跃。

对于GaOx基催化剂，活性位点是通过配位不饱和Ga3+提供的Lewis酸位。β-Ga2O3表现出高活性，因为它的单斜结构允许Ga3+离子均匀分布在八面体和四面体上，提供了大量弱酸位点。第一性原理计算揭示了激活机制，涉及丙烷分子中一个氢原子的丢失以形成丙基组分和羟基组分，随后是β-H的去除以形成另一个羟基组分。

添加贵金属，如Pt或Rh，可以显著增强GaOx基催化剂的活性和稳定性。Pt修改了GaOx表面，促进了氢的脱附并恢复了镓氢化合物和/或羟基物种。同样，Rh纳米簇可以增加二氧化锆的可还原性，促进氢的脱附并降低PDH反应的能量壁垒。

氢气预处理是影响催化剂性能和PDH反应中失活的关键因素。它可以生成更活跃的位点，如GaH物种，这些物种比H+和Ga+位点更活跃。这个过程还可以调节配位不饱和位点的浓度，从而影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their structural properties and catalytic behavior. The MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports offer a more uniform pore size distribution compared to traditional metal oxide supports. This feature enhances the dispersion of metal particles, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

Lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the activity of CrOx-supported catalysts. They assist in the activation of propane molecules by lowering the activation barrier for hydrogen and propylene formation. H2 pretreatment is a technique that facilitates the formation of GaH species on GaOx-based catalysts, which are more active than hydrogen or Ga+ sites. This enhances the catalytic performance of GaOx catalysts in PDH reactions.

The H2 pretreatment process also aids in the recovery of gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species on Pt-modified GaOx catalysts. This improves the activity of these catalysts in PDH reactions. However, the continuous regeneration process of ZrO2-based catalysts leads to significant sintering, which affects their performance. Controlled regeneration methods are required to maintain their activity.

In summary, MCM-41 and SBA-15 supports offer advantages in terms of improved dispersion and enhanced catalytic activity in PDH reactions. Lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment are key factors that influence the performance of CrOx, GaOx, and ZrO2-based catalysts. However, challenges remain in maintaining the activity of ZrO2-based catalysts due to sintering during continuous regeneration processes.

The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

Advantages of using MCM-41 and SBA-15 as supports include their ordered mesoporous structure, which can provide a large surface area and well-defined pore sizes, leading to better dispersion of metal species and potentially higher activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The ordered arrangement of pores can also facilitate faster diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the reaction kinetics.

VOx-supported catalysts, such as VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/SBA-15, demonstrate superior propylene selectivity and stability during continuous regeneration cycles. This is attributed to the high reactivity of vanadium species and their ability to selectively activate propane without over-oxidizing to COx. However, the coke deposition on VOx-based catalysts is more severe than on metal oxide supports, which can limit their long-term stability.

CrOx-supported catalysts, like CrOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/SBA-15, show comparable activity and selectivity to VOx-based catalysts. However, they suffer from lower stability due to carbon deposition and aggregation of Cr3+ ions. The lattice oxygen species in CrOx play a role in the activation of propane molecules, but the rapid loss of oxygen under reaction conditions leads to deactivation.

Incorporating dopants, such as Pt, into Ga2O3 can effectively increase its activity by enhancing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. Pt modification facilitates hydrogen desorption and recovers gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species, leading to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

ZrO2-based catalysts, particularly when modified with Rh nanoclusters or doped with Y2O3, can show superior dehydrogenation activity due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) cations. These Zrcus sites lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8, contributing to increased activity. However, over-reduction must be carefully managed to avoid blocking hydrogen recombination sites.

In conclusion, MCM-41 and SBA-15 as supports offer advantages in terms of structure and pore size for VOx and CrOx catalysts, potentially improving their performance in PDH reactions. However, the limitations in coke deposition, stability, and reactivity must be addressed to fully exploit their potential.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，受其独特的结构特性和催化行为的影响。使用MCM-41和SBA-15作为支持的优点包括它们的有序介孔结构，可以提供大量的表面积和定义良好的孔隙尺寸，从而提高活性和选择性，并且可能在PDH反应中产生更高的活性。有序排列的孔有助于更快地扩散反应物和产物，从而增强反应动力学。

VOx支持的催化剂，如VOx/MCM-41和VOx/SBA-15，在连续再生周期中显示出更好的丙烯选择性和稳定性。这归因于钒物种的高反应性和它们在不氧化COx的情况下选择性活化丙烷的能力。然而，VOx基催化剂上的焦炭沉积比在金属氧化物支持上更为严重，这限制了它们的长期稳定性。

CrOx支持的催化剂，如CrOx/MCM-41和CrOx/SBA-15，显示了与VOx基催化剂相当的活性和选择性。但是，由于碳沉积和Cr3+离子的聚集，它们的稳定性较低。CrOx中的氧离子参与丙烷分子的激活，但反应条件下的快速氧损失导致催化剂失活。

将Pt等掺杂剂引入Ga2O3可以有效地通过增加Ga3+位点的数量来提高其活性，从而增强氢解离并恢复镓氢和/或羟基物种，从而提高PDH反应中的催化性能。

ZrO2基催化剂，尤其是当与Rh纳米簇结合或掺杂Y2O3时，由于存在协调未饱和Zr（Zrcus）离子，可以表现出较高的脱氢活性。这些Zrcus位点降低了H2和C3H6从C3H8形成所需的活化能，从而提高了活性。但是，必须谨慎管理过量还原以避免阻塞氢重组位点。

总之，MCM-41和SBA-15作为支持在VOx和CrOx催化剂中提供了优势，尤其是在结构和孔径大小方面，这可能提高了它们在PDH反应中的性能。但是，必须解决焦炭沉积、稳定性和反应性的问题，以充分利用其潜力。

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key insights. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these materials differ notably from traditional metal oxide supports. 

1. **CrOx and VOx on MCM-41 and SBA-15**: CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 display distinct properties. The lattice oxygen species on these supports play a critical role in influencing the catalytic behavior. For instance, the presence of lattice oxygen can significantly alter the CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers, impacting the overall PDH reaction efficiency.

2. **Single-site Co2+ and Zn2+/SiO2**: A non-redox mechanism for activation of CH and HH bonds has been reported by Adam S. Hock and coworkers, utilizing single-site Co2+ and single-site Zn2+/SiO2. This mechanism offers an alternative pathway for PDH reactions, potentially enhancing selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions.

3. **Isolated Cr3+ Sites**: The isolated Cr3+ sites on CrOx-based catalysts are considered active sites for PDH reactions. These sites enable heterolytic activation of CH bonds, leading to the formation of Cr3+C3H7 intermediates and subsequent release of C3H6.

4. **VO Bonds in VOx**: The various VO bonds present in VOx materials lead to different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers. This complexity in bond structure impacts the catalytic performance and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

5. **Ga Species Dependence**: The activity of GaOx-based catalysts for PDH is significantly influenced by the structure of Ga species. Different forms of Ga, such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+, have varying catalytic efficiencies and mechanisms.

These findings highlight the importance of structural properties, including lattice oxygen species and the specific forms of metal oxides, in determining the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions. The use of mesoporous silica supports can offer advantages in terms of controlled surface area, porosity, and potential for enhanced selectivity and stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals distinct advantages and limitations. These catalysts offer unique structural properties that enhance their catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

For CrOx-supported catalysts, the lattice oxygen species play a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism. These species lower the activation barrier for hydrogen and propylene formation, contributing to their high reactivity. However, the low stability of CrOx-based catalysts is a limitation, characterized by a deactivation rate of 0.5 h^-1, leading to rapid deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration.

VOx-supported catalysts, on the other hand, exhibit a complex mixture of V species (V5+, V4+, V3+, isolated V, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5). Despite their high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared to CrOx-based catalysts, the precise role of these species in propane activation and selective propylene production remains unclear. This uncertainty hinders the optimization of VOx-supported catalysts for PDH reactions.

Ga2O3-supported catalysts, particularly when supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15, leverage the Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. The monoclinic structure of β-Ga2O3, with evenly distributed Ga3+ ions, facilitates the formation of a large number of weak acid sites, enhancing its catalytic activity. H2 pretreatment further promotes the formation of GaH species, which are more active than H+ and Ga+ sites, thereby improving catalyst performance.

However, GaOx-based catalysts face significant sintering during continuous regeneration operations, necessitating controlled regeneration strategies to maintain their performance. The lattice oxygen species and H2 pretreatment are crucial factors in determining the catalytic behavior and deactivation in PDH reactions.

In the case of ZrO2-based catalysts, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) cations can be significantly tuned by altering the particle size and crystalline phase. Doping and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere generate Zrcus sites, increasing dehydrogenation activity. Yet, over-reduction must be carefully managed to prevent blockage of hydrogen recombination sites, impacting catalyst performance.

Overall, while MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts, as well as GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, exhibit promising activity and selectivity in PDH reactions, their performance is influenced by factors such as lattice oxygen species, H2 pretreatment, and the management of sintering and deactivation during regeneration. Optimizing these catalysts requires a deeper understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms and the careful control of catalyst preparation and regeneration processes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，分析金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，展现出独特的结构特性和催化行为，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比。这些催化剂提供了增强其催化性能的独特结构特性。

对于CrOx基催化剂，晶格氧物种在PDH反应机制中扮演着关键角色。这些物种降低了氢和丙烯形成时的活化能垒，从而提高了它们的高活性。然而，CrOx基催化剂的低稳定性是一个限制因素，其失活率为0.5 h^-1，导致快速失活并需要频繁再生。

VOx基催化剂表现出复杂的V物种混合（V5+、V4+、V3+、孤立的V、寡聚的Vn+和结晶的V2O5）。尽管它们的高活性和抑制失活率与CrOx基催化剂相比优于CrOx基催化剂，但这些物种在丙烷激活和选择性丙烯生产的具体作用仍然不清楚。这种不确定性阻碍了对VOx基催化剂的优化以适应PDH反应。

Ga2O3支持的催化剂，特别是当支持在MCM-41和SBA-15上时，利用了由协调不饱和Ga3+离子提供的Lewis酸位点。β-Ga2O3的单斜结构，其中Ga3+离子均匀分布在八面体和四面体上，可以提供大量较弱的酸位，从而增强其催化活性。H2预处理进一步促进了GaH物种的形成，这些物种比H+和Ga+位点更活跃，从而改善了催化剂性能。

然而，GaOx基催化剂在连续再生操作期间面临严重的烧结问题，需要采取控制再生策略来维持其性能。晶格氧物种和H2预处理是确定PDH反应中催化剂行为和失活的关键因素。

至于ZrO2基催化剂，在改变颗粒大小和晶体相的情况下，可以通过掺杂和使用还原气氛生成Zrcus位点，显著调节Zrcus位点的数量。这增加了脱氢活性。然而，过度还原必须谨慎管理，以防止氢重组位点的堵塞，影响催化剂性能。

综上所述，尽管MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂以及GaOx和ZrO2基催化剂在PDH反应中显示出有希望的活性和选择性，但它们的性能受到晶格氧物种、H2预处理和再生过程中防止烧结和失活的影响。为了优化这些催化剂，需要深入了解其基本反应机制，并仔细控制催化剂制备和再生过程。
