<p>In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 3), as well as high toxicity. Therefore, low toxicity and stable alternative catalysts are increasingly desired.</p>
<p>By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided.</p>

Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, exhibit high reactivity and selectivity in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These materials offer advantages over traditional metal oxide supports due to their well-defined structures and controllable pore sizes. The lattice oxygen species within MCM-41 and SBA-15 can participate in alkane activation, contributing to the catalytic activity. H2 pretreatment enhances the formation of active Zrcus sites on zirconia, thereby increasing the PDH performance. However, careful control of the reduction process is essential to avoid over-reduction, which might hinder the promoting effect of noble metals like Rh. The limitations of MCM-41 and SBA-15 include their high toxicity and low stability, necessitating the development of alternative low-toxicity, stable catalysts.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出高活性和选择性。这些材料由于其明确的结构和可控的孔隙尺寸，在传统金属氧化物支撑材料上提供了优势。MCM-41和SBA-15中的晶格氧物种可以参与烷烃活化，从而促进催化活性。通过H2预处理可以增加锆基质上的活性Zrcus位点，进而提高PDH性能。然而，需要仔细控制还原过程，避免过度还原，以免影响贵金属如铑的促进效果。MCM-41和SBA-15的局限性包括它们的高毒性以及稳定性低，这要求开发替代的低毒性和稳定的催化剂。
