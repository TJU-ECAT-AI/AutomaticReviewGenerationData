Analyzing the performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions reveals several key insights. The structural properties and catalytic behavior of these materials differ notably from traditional metal oxide supports. 

1. **CrOx and VOx on MCM-41 and SBA-15**: CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15 display distinct properties. The lattice oxygen species on these supports play a critical role in influencing the catalytic behavior. For instance, the presence of lattice oxygen can significantly alter the CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers, impacting the overall PDH reaction efficiency.

2. **Single-site Co2+ and Zn2+/SiO2**: A non-redox mechanism for activation of CH and HH bonds has been reported by Adam S. Hock and coworkers, utilizing single-site Co2+ and single-site Zn2+/SiO2. This mechanism offers an alternative pathway for PDH reactions, potentially enhancing selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions.

3. **Isolated Cr3+ Sites**: The isolated Cr3+ sites on CrOx-based catalysts are considered active sites for PDH reactions. These sites enable heterolytic activation of CH bonds, leading to the formation of Cr3+C3H7 intermediates and subsequent release of C3H6.

4. **VO Bonds in VOx**: The various VO bonds present in VOx materials lead to different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers. This complexity in bond structure impacts the catalytic performance and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

5. **Ga Species Dependence**: The activity of GaOx-based catalysts for PDH is significantly influenced by the structure of Ga species. Different forms of Ga, such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+, have varying catalytic efficiencies and mechanisms.

These findings highlight the importance of structural properties, including lattice oxygen species and the specific forms of metal oxides, in determining the performance of MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx catalysts in PDH reactions. The use of mesoporous silica supports can offer advantages in terms of controlled surface area, porosity, and potential for enhanced selectivity and stability compared to traditional metal oxide supports.

分析金属有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能揭示了一些关键见解。这些材料的结构特性和催化行为与传统金属氧化物支持有显著差异。

1. **CrOx和VOx在MCM-41和SBA-15上的表现**：CrOx和VOx基催化剂在MCM-41和SBA-15上的表现具有不同的特性。这些支持上的晶格氧物种对催化行为的影响至关重要。例如，晶格氧的存在可以显著改变CH激活和丙烯脱氢能量壁垒，影响PDH反应的整体效率。

2. **单个位点Co2+和Zn2+/SiO2**：Adam S. Hock和同事报道的非还原机制用于激活CH和HH键，利用单个位点Co2+和单个位点Zn2+/SiO2。这种机制为PDH反应提供了一个替代途径，可能增强选择性并减少不必要的副反应。

3. **孤立的Cr3+位点**：CrOx基催化剂中孤立的Cr3+位点被认为是PDH反应的活性位点。这些位点能够实现异裂激活CH键，导致Cr3+C3H7中间体的形成，并随后释放C3H6。

4. **VO键在VOx中的作用**：VOx材料中各种类型的VO键导致不同的CH激活和丙烯脱氢能量壁垒。这种复杂的键结构影响了PDH反应的催化性能和选择性。

5. **Ga物种的依赖性**：GaOx基催化剂在PDH中的活性显著受到Ga物种结构的影响。不同形式的Ga，如Ga3+、[GaH2]+和[GaH]2+，在催化效率和机制上表现出不同的效率。

这些发现强调了结构属性，包括晶格氧物种和特定形式的金属氧化物，在确定MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx催化剂在PDH反应中的性能的重要性。使用介孔二氧化硅支持可以提供优势，包括可控的表面积、孔隙率以及潜在的增强选择性和稳定性的可能性，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比。
