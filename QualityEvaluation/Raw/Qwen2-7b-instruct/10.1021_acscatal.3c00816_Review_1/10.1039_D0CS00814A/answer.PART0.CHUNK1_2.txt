Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, particularly MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, have been evaluated for their performance in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The key points to consider are:

1. The active sites of these catalysts are challenging to identify due to their complex structures and pretreatment methods. This makes it difficult to determine their behavior under PDH reaction conditions.

2. The four active structures of CrOx/Al2O3 include isolated mono-alumina chromate, isolated polymeric alumina chromate, chromiumchromate, and aluminumchromiumchromate. These structures can influence the PDH reaction.

3. GaOx-based catalysts' activity in PDH is highly dependent on the structure of Ga species. This highlights the importance of structure in determining catalyst performance.

4. DFT calculations have shown that the highest dehydrogenation barrier is found over V2O5H2, corresponding to lower initial activity and the presence of surface VOH groups during the experiment.

5. Increasing the concentration of Cr6+ leads to higher C1C3 yield and coke yield, demonstrating the complexity of these catalysts in terms of their activity and deactivation.

6. The stability of the catalysts is determined by their resistance to coke formation, which can be quantified through a relationship between the deactivation rate and the rate constant of carbon formation.

These insights suggest that the choice of metal oxide, its structure, and the pretreatment methods play crucial roles in achieving optimal performance in PDH reactions. Understanding the detailed mechanisms and identifying the active sites under reaction conditions are ongoing challenges in this field.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，尤其是MCM-41和SBA-15支持的VOx和CrOx，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能进行了评估。需要考虑的关键点如下：

1. 这些催化剂的活性位点难以识别，因为它们具有复杂的结构和预处理方法。这使得在PDH反应条件下确定其行为变得困难。

2. CrOx/Al2O3的四种活性结构包括孤立的单铝酸铬、孤立的聚铝酸铬、铬酸盐和铝铬酸盐。这些结构可以影响PDH反应。

3. GaOx基催化剂在PDH中的活性高度依赖于Ga物种的结构。这突出了结构在确定催化剂性能时的重要性。

4. 根据DFT计算，最高的脱氢壁垒存在于V2O5H2上，对应于较低的初始活性和实验过程中表面VOH组的存在。

5. 增加Cr6+的浓度导致更高的C1C3产率和焦炭产率，表明这些催化剂在活动性和失活方面的复杂性。

6. 催化剂的稳定性由其对焦炭形成的抵抗力决定，可以通过催化剂失活速率与碳形成速率常数之间的关系来量化。

这些见解表明，金属氧化物的选择、其结构以及预处理方法在实现PDH反应的最佳性能中起着关键作用。理解详细机制并识别反应条件下的活性位点是这一领域持续面临的挑战。
