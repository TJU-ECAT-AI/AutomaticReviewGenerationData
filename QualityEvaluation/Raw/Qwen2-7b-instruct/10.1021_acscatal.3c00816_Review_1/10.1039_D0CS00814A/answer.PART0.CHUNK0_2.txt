The performance of Metal-Ordered Mesoporous Silica (OMS) catalysts, specifically MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported VOx and CrOx, in Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior compared to traditional metal oxide supports. 

Advantages of using MCM-41 and SBA-15 as supports include their ordered mesoporous structure, which can provide a large surface area and well-defined pore sizes, leading to better dispersion of metal species and potentially higher activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The ordered arrangement of pores can also facilitate faster diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the reaction kinetics.

VOx-supported catalysts, such as VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/SBA-15, demonstrate superior propylene selectivity and stability during continuous regeneration cycles. This is attributed to the high reactivity of vanadium species and their ability to selectively activate propane without over-oxidizing to COx. However, the coke deposition on VOx-based catalysts is more severe than on metal oxide supports, which can limit their long-term stability.

CrOx-supported catalysts, like CrOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/SBA-15, show comparable activity and selectivity to VOx-based catalysts. However, they suffer from lower stability due to carbon deposition and aggregation of Cr3+ ions. The lattice oxygen species in CrOx play a role in the activation of propane molecules, but the rapid loss of oxygen under reaction conditions leads to deactivation.

Incorporating dopants, such as Pt, into Ga2O3 can effectively increase its activity by enhancing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. Pt modification facilitates hydrogen desorption and recovers gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species, leading to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

ZrO2-based catalysts, particularly when modified with Rh nanoclusters or doped with Y2O3, can show superior dehydrogenation activity due to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus) cations. These Zrcus sites lower the activation barrier of H2 and C3H6 formation from C3H8, contributing to increased activity. However, over-reduction must be carefully managed to avoid blocking hydrogen recombination sites.

In conclusion, MCM-41 and SBA-15 as supports offer advantages in terms of structure and pore size for VOx and CrOx catalysts, potentially improving their performance in PDH reactions. However, the limitations in coke deposition, stability, and reactivity must be addressed to fully exploit their potential.

金属有序介孔硅（OMS）催化剂，特别是VOx和CrOx在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能，与传统的金属氧化物支持相比，受其独特的结构特性和催化行为的影响。使用MCM-41和SBA-15作为支持的优点包括它们的有序介孔结构，可以提供大量的表面积和定义良好的孔隙尺寸，从而提高活性和选择性，并且可能在PDH反应中产生更高的活性。有序排列的孔有助于更快地扩散反应物和产物，从而增强反应动力学。

VOx支持的催化剂，如VOx/MCM-41和VOx/SBA-15，在连续再生周期中显示出更好的丙烯选择性和稳定性。这归因于钒物种的高反应性和它们在不氧化COx的情况下选择性活化丙烷的能力。然而，VOx基催化剂上的焦炭沉积比在金属氧化物支持上更为严重，这限制了它们的长期稳定性。

CrOx支持的催化剂，如CrOx/MCM-41和CrOx/SBA-15，显示了与VOx基催化剂相当的活性和选择性。但是，由于碳沉积和Cr3+离子的聚集，它们的稳定性较低。CrOx中的氧离子参与丙烷分子的激活，但反应条件下的快速氧损失导致催化剂失活。

将Pt等掺杂剂引入Ga2O3可以有效地通过增加Ga3+位点的数量来提高其活性，从而增强氢解离并恢复镓氢和/或羟基物种，从而提高PDH反应中的催化性能。

ZrO2基催化剂，尤其是当与Rh纳米簇结合或掺杂Y2O3时，由于存在协调未饱和Zr（Zrcus）离子，可以表现出较高的脱氢活性。这些Zrcus位点降低了H2和C3H6从C3H8形成所需的活化能，从而提高了活性。但是，必须谨慎管理过量还原以避免阻塞氢重组位点。

总之，MCM-41和SBA-15作为支持在VOx和CrOx催化剂中提供了优势，尤其是在结构和孔径大小方面，这可能提高了它们在PDH反应中的性能。但是，必须解决焦炭沉积、稳定性和反应性的问题，以充分利用其潜力。
