The research presented here involves a density functional theory (DFT) study focusing on the activation and dissociation of carbon dioxide on ceria (110). The investigation delved into CO2 adsorption processes on both stoichiometric and reduced ceria (110) surfaces, and conducted an electronic analysis of ceria as a catalyst for CO2 activation. The study also explored the dissociation of CO2 on the reduced ceria (110) surface. Conclusions were formulated based on the findings from these computational methods.
