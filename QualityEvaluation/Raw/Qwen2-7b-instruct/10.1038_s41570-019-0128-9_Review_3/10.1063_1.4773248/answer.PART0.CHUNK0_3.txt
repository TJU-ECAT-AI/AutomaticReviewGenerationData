The provided literature does not contain specific information comparing bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, nor does it provide insights into their performance, synergistic effects, or potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Therefore, there are no relevant quotes to answer the given question.
