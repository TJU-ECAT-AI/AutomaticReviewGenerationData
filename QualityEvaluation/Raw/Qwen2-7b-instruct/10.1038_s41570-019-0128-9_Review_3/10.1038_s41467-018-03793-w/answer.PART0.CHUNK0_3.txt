The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct compositions, selectivities, stabilities, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni/CeO2, composed of oxidized iron and metallic nickel, demonstrates a strong preference for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway (CO2-ODHP), leading to the production of propylene. Conversely, Ni3Pt/CeO2, featuring a combination of nickel and platinum, shows high activity and selectivity towards the dry reforming pathway (DRP), predominantly generating carbon monoxide. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni/CeO2 enhances the catalytic efficiency for propylene production, while the coupling of Ni with Pt in Ni3Pt/CeO2 boosts the reforming activity. Both catalysts offer the potential for environmentally benign catalysis, contributing to global alkene production and the reduction of CO2 emissions.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2这两种双金属催化剂在丙烯醇与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）和干燥重整（DRP）反应中，展现出不同的组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机理。Fe3Ni/CeO2，由氧化铁和金属镍组成，倾向于氧化脱氢路径（CO2-ODHP），从而生成丙烯。相反，Ni3Pt/CeO2，结合了镍和铂，显示出高活性和CO选择性，主要产生一氧化碳。Fe和Ni之间的协同作用增强了Fe3Ni/CeO2的催化效率，促进丙烯生产。Ni与Pt的耦合在Ni3Pt/CeO2中提高了重整活性。这两种催化剂为环境友好的催化提供了可能性，有助于全球烯烃生产并减少二氧化碳排放。
