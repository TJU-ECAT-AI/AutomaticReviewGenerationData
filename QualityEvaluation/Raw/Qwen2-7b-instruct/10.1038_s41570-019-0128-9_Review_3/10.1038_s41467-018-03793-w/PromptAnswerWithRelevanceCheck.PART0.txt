[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[2] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
[3] "The apparent activation energies were derived by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 803–843 K. Over Fe3Ni, the activation barrier for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation was found to be 115 kJ mol−1, while the activation barrier for reforming over Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol−1."
[4] "The TGA results indicate that the Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
[5] "The in-situ XANES measurements identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."
[6] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces to further gain insight into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2+H2O(g) and *CH3CH2+*CO+H2O(g), respectively."
[7] "The DFT results revealed that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 is selective for propylene production through CO2-ODHP, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 shows high selectivity towards CO in the DRP. Fe3Ni demonstrates a synergistic effect that increases propylene yield compared to monometallic catalysts. The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt. Fe3Ni has a low mass loss during reactions, suggesting it is unlikely to deactivate due to coking. Both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions. DFT calculations predict that the CH bond cleavage pathway is favored on Fe3Ni(111) surface, while the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111) surface. This insight supports the experimental findings on the reaction mechanisms and the selectivities of these bimetallic catalysts.

Fe3Ni/CeO2催化剂通过CO2-ODHP途径表现出对丙烯的选择性，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP中显示出对CO的高选择性。Fe3Ni显示协同效应，能增加丙烯的产率与单金属催化剂相比。CO2-ODHP和DRP的活化能分别是115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1，分别在Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt上。Fe3Ni在反应过程中仅损失不到其原始质量的一半，这表明主要的失活途径不太可能是结焦。Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt均在反应条件下由金属Ni组成。DFT计算预测Fe3Ni(111)表面的CH键裂解路径占优势，而Ni3Pt(111)表面的CC键裂解路径更优。这些见解支持实验结果关于这两种双金属催化剂的反应机制和选择性的发现。

[1] "The inherent variability and insufficiencies in the co-production of propylene from steam crackers has raised concerns regarding the global propylene production gap and has directed industry to develop more on-purpose propylene technologies."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas."
[3] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[4] "Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."

[7] "On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission."
[8] "On Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the *O insertion reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O *CH3CH2CH2O + *) along the CC bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.75 eV and Ea = 1.07 eV) is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[9] "On the Fe3O3/Ni(111) surface, the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ΔE = 0.40 eV and Ea = 0.29 eV) is highly favorable over the *O insertion reaction (ΔE = 0.01 eV and Ea = 2.13 eV)."

1. The Fe3Ni catalyst is promising for CO2-ODHP, showing high selectivity for propylene production, while Ni3Pt is effective for DRP with a high selectivity for CO. Fe3Ni is more stable, as it loses only a small fraction of its mass, suggesting it is unlikely to deactivate due to coking. Ni3Pt, on the other hand, has a higher selectivity for CO production.

2. The in situ XANES measurements revealed that the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic platinum, indicating a metallic state rather than an oxidized form. The DFT calculations suggest that the Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2, while the Ni3Pt(111) surface favors the C-C bond cleavage to form *CO.

3. The DFT calculations indicate that the oxidative CH bond cleavage is energetically favored on the Fe3Ni(111) surface, while the oxidative CC bond cleavage is favored on the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface. This aligns with the experimental observations of the reaction mechanisms occurring on these surfaces.

1. Fe3Ni催化剂在CO2-ODHP中表现出色，具有高选择性用于丙烯生产，而Ni3Pt对于DRP有效，对CO的选择性高。Fe3Ni更稳定，因为它只损失了其质量的小部分，表明它不太可能由于结焦而失效。相比之下，Ni3Pt对CO生产的选区性更高。

2. 在原位XANES测量中发现，Ni3Pt催化剂由金属铂组成，表示其为金属状态，而非氧化态。DFT计算显示，Fe3Ni(111)表面促进丙烷的氧化CH键裂解形成*CH3CHCH2，而Ni3Pt(111)表面则有利于C-C键裂解形成*CO。

3. DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面氧化CH键裂解的能量优势高于氧化CC键裂解，这与实验观察到的反应机制在这些表面上发生的现象相一致。

[1] "Previous work in CO2-ODH primarily focuses on supported chromium catalysts1315 as a result of their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states16, but implementation is limited due to short lifecycles and high toxicity of chromium17. Ni is mainly used for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking is still a problem1820."
[2] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "In contrast, when Ni is alloyed with precious metal Pt, reforming activity is enhanced compared to monometallic Ni3."
[4] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[5] "Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts."
[6] "Oxidation states by in situ XANES. In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 3."
[7] "DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."
[8] "Flow reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations as it was observed that the Fe3Ni catalyst is selective for propylene production, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows good activity and CO selectivity."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 were studied for their potential in combining CO2 reduction with propane oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) and dry reforming (DRP). Fe3Ni/CeO2 was found to exhibit promising selectivity towards propylene via the CO2-ODH pathway, producing 58.2% propylene with a C3H6 selectivity. In contrast, Ni3Pt/CeO2 showed high selectivity towards CO in the DRP reaction. The catalysts' performances were consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicating that Fe3Ni(111) surface and FeO/Ni(111) interface favor CH bond scission for CO2-ODH, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors CC bond cleavage for DRP. The experimental findings suggest that Fe3Ni/CeO2 is more stable and selective for propylene production, whereas Ni3Pt/CeO2 is better suited for CO production. Future research aims to enhance propylene yield through the development of more stable and selective catalyst materials.

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct compositions, selectivities, stabilities, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni/CeO2, composed of oxidized iron and metallic nickel, demonstrates a strong preference for the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway (CO2-ODHP), leading to the production of propylene. Conversely, Ni3Pt/CeO2, featuring a combination of nickel and platinum, shows high activity and selectivity towards the dry reforming pathway (DRP), predominantly generating carbon monoxide. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni/CeO2 enhances the catalytic efficiency for propylene production, while the coupling of Ni with Pt in Ni3Pt/CeO2 boosts the reforming activity. Both catalysts offer the potential for environmentally benign catalysis, contributing to global alkene production and the reduction of CO2 emissions.
