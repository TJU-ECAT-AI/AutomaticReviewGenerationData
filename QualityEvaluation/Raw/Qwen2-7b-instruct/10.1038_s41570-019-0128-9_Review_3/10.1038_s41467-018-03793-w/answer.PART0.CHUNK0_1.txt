1. The Fe3Ni catalyst is promising for CO2-ODHP, showing high selectivity for propylene production, while Ni3Pt is effective for DRP with a high selectivity for CO. Fe3Ni is more stable, as it loses only a small fraction of its mass, suggesting it is unlikely to deactivate due to coking. Ni3Pt, on the other hand, has a higher selectivity for CO production.

2. The in situ XANES measurements revealed that the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic platinum, indicating a metallic state rather than an oxidized form. The DFT calculations suggest that the Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative CH bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2, while the Ni3Pt(111) surface favors the C-C bond cleavage to form *CO.

3. The DFT calculations indicate that the oxidative CH bond cleavage is energetically favored on the Fe3Ni(111) surface, while the oxidative CC bond cleavage is favored on the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface. This aligns with the experimental observations of the reaction mechanisms occurring on these surfaces.

1. Fe3Ni催化剂在CO2-ODHP中表现出色，具有高选择性用于丙烯生产，而Ni3Pt对于DRP有效，对CO的选择性高。Fe3Ni更稳定，因为它只损失了其质量的小部分，表明它不太可能由于结焦而失效。相比之下，Ni3Pt对CO生产的选区性更高。

2. 在原位XANES测量中发现，Ni3Pt催化剂由金属铂组成，表示其为金属状态，而非氧化态。DFT计算显示，Fe3Ni(111)表面促进丙烷的氧化CH键裂解形成*CH3CHCH2，而Ni3Pt(111)表面则有利于C-C键裂解形成*CO。

3. DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面氧化CH键裂解的能量优势高于氧化CC键裂解，这与实验观察到的反应机制在这些表面上发生的现象相一致。
