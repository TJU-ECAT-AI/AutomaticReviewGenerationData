[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[2] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
[3] "The apparent activation energies were derived by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 803–843 K. Over Fe3Ni, the activation barrier for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation was found to be 115 kJ mol−1, while the activation barrier for reforming over Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol−1."
[4] "The TGA results indicate that the Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
[5] "The in-situ XANES measurements identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."
[6] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces to further gain insight into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2+H2O(g) and *CH3CH2+*CO+H2O(g), respectively."
[7] "The DFT results revealed that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 is selective for propylene production through CO2-ODHP, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 shows high selectivity towards CO in the DRP. Fe3Ni demonstrates a synergistic effect that increases propylene yield compared to monometallic catalysts. The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt. Fe3Ni has a low mass loss during reactions, suggesting it is unlikely to deactivate due to coking. Both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions. DFT calculations predict that the CH bond cleavage pathway is favored on Fe3Ni(111) surface, while the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111) surface. This insight supports the experimental findings on the reaction mechanisms and the selectivities of these bimetallic catalysts.

Fe3Ni/CeO2催化剂通过CO2-ODHP途径表现出对丙烯的选择性，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP中显示出对CO的高选择性。Fe3Ni显示协同效应，能增加丙烯的产率与单金属催化剂相比。CO2-ODHP和DRP的活化能分别是115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1，分别在Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt上。Fe3Ni在反应过程中仅损失不到其原始质量的一半，这表明主要的失活途径不太可能是结焦。Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt均在反应条件下由金属Ni组成。DFT计算预测Fe3Ni(111)表面的CH键裂解路径占优势，而Ni3Pt(111)表面的CC键裂解路径更优。这些见解支持实验结果关于这两种双金属催化剂的反应机制和选择性的发现。
