[1] "Previous work in CO2-ODH primarily focuses on supported chromium catalysts1315 as a result of their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states16, but implementation is limited due to short lifecycles and high toxicity of chromium17. Ni is mainly used for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking is still a problem1820."
[2] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "In contrast, when Ni is alloyed with precious metal Pt, reforming activity is enhanced compared to monometallic Ni3."
[4] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[5] "Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts."
[6] "Oxidation states by in situ XANES. In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 3."
[7] "DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."
[8] "Flow reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations as it was observed that the Fe3Ni catalyst is selective for propylene production, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows good activity and CO selectivity."
[9] "Future efforts should be geared toward enhancing propylene yield through the discovery of more stable and selective catalytic materials."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 were studied for their potential in combining CO2 reduction with propane oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) and dry reforming (DRP). Fe3Ni/CeO2 was found to exhibit promising selectivity towards propylene via the CO2-ODH pathway, producing 58.2% propylene with a C3H6 selectivity. In contrast, Ni3Pt/CeO2 showed high selectivity towards CO in the DRP reaction. The catalysts' performances were consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicating that Fe3Ni(111) surface and FeO/Ni(111) interface favor CH bond scission for CO2-ODH, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors CC bond cleavage for DRP. The experimental findings suggest that Fe3Ni/CeO2 is more stable and selective for propylene production, whereas Ni3Pt/CeO2 is better suited for CO production. Future research aims to enhance propylene yield through the development of more stable and selective catalyst materials.

研究了Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2双金属催化剂在二氧化碳还原与丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）和干重整（DRP）的结合潜力。发现Fe3Ni/CeO2对于通过CO2-ODH途径产生丙烯具有良好的选择性，产率可达58.2%，且C3H6选择性高。相比之下，Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP反应中显示出对CO的良好活性和高选择性。实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算一致，表明Fe3Ni(111)表面和FeO/Ni(111)界面更适合于CO2-ODH中的CH键断裂，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面更适合于DRP中的CC键裂解。实验发现，Fe3Ni/CeO2在稳定性和选择性方面更适合于丙烯生产，而Ni3Pt/CeO2更适合于CO生产。未来的研究目标是通过开发更稳定、选择性更高的催化剂材料来提高丙烯产量。
