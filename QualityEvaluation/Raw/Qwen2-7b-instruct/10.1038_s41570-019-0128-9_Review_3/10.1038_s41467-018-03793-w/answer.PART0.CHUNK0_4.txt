The study compares the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in their application to CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The catalysts are synthesized through impregnation of metals onto ceria support. The Fe3Ni catalyst shows promise for propylene production through CO2-ODHP, exhibiting a 58.2% selectivity towards C3H6. In contrast, the Ni3Pt catalyst is active for DRP with high selectivity towards CO. Kinetic studies reveal that the activation barriers for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation over Fe3Ni and reforming over Ni3Pt are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively. DFT calculations suggest that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the oxidative CH bond cleavage pathway for CO2-ODHP, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the CC bond cleavage for DRP. In situ XANES measurements confirm the local environment of metals under reaction conditions, indicating that Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni. The catalysts' selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms offer insights into their potential for environmentally benign catalysis in global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

研究比较了Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2双金属催化剂在丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODH）和干重整（DRP）中的应用。通过将金属浸渍到氧化铈支持物上合成催化剂。Fe3Ni催化剂表现出通过CO2-ODHP生产丙烯的潜力，显示出58.2%的C3H6选择性。相比之下，Ni3Pt催化剂在DRP中表现出对CO的高选择性。动力学研究表明，Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt在803-843 K温度范围内的活化壁垒分别为115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1。第一性原理计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面有利于CO2-ODHP中的氧化CH键断裂路径，而Ni3Pt(111)表面则促进DRP中的CC键断裂。原位XANES测量确认了在反应条件下金属的局部环境，表明Fe3Ni由氧化铁和金属镍组成。这些催化剂的选择性、稳定性和反应机制提供了它们在全球烯烃生产和CO2排放减少方面的潜在环保催化作用的见解。
