[1] "The present work aimed to identify bimetallic combinations that were active and selective for the reactions of CO2+C3H8."
[2] "Of the three transition metals examined with Pt1 and Pd1, Ni3 outperformed Fe3 and Co3 in terms of CO2 and propane conversions."
[3] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[4] "The CoxNiy catalyst, which are composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, were also active and selective for the DRP pathway."
[5] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[6] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."

1. The study aimed to find bimetallic catalysts that are effective and specific for CO2+C3H8 reactions. 
2. Among the examined transition metals with Pt1 and Pd1, Ni3 showed better performance than Fe3 and Co3 in CO2 and propane conversions.
3. Bimetallic catalysts with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more reactive, but also more stable compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1.
4. Catalysts with metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions were active and selective for DRP reactions.
5. FexNiy catalysts favored CO2-ODHP reactions, and their selectivity could be adjusted by modifying the Ni content in the bimetallic composition.
6. Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 shifted the selectivity towards the DRP pathway instead of CO2-ODHP.

1. 研究旨在寻找适用于CO2+C3H8反应的双金属催化剂。
2. 在使用Pt1和Pd1的过渡金属中，Ni3在CO2和丙烷转化方面的表现优于Fe3和Co3。
3. 含有Ni3和Co3的双金属催化剂比单金属Pt1和Pd1更活跃且更稳定。
4. 含有金属态Co和Ni的催化剂在反应条件下对DRP反应具有活性和选择性。
5. FexNiy催化剂倾向于CO2-ODHP反应，通过调整bimetallic组合中的Ni含量可以进一步调整其选择性。
6. 将Ni原子比增加到1以上会将选择性从CO2-ODHP转向DRP路径。
