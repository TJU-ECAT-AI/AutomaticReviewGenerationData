[1] "Of the three transition metals examined with Pt1 and Pd1, Ni3 outperformed Fe3 and Co3 in terms of CO2 and propane conversions."
[2] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[3] "The CoxNiy catalyst, which are composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, were also active and selective for the DRP pathway."
[4] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[5] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."
[6] "Overall, a bimetallic catalyst library to determine inherent activity toward DRP or CO2-ODHP was established and can be used toward future efforts to increase activity, stability, and selectivity."

1. In terms of CO2 and propane conversions, nickel-based bimetallic catalysts (Ni3) outperformed iron (Fe3) and cobalt (Co3) catalysts when compared with platinum (Pt1) and palladium (Pd1) monometals.
2. Nickel-based bimetallic catalysts showed not only higher activity but also better stability compared to platinum and palladium monometals.
3. Catalysts composed of metallic cobalt and nickel showed activity and selectivity towards the dry reforming pathway (DRP).
4. Iron-nickel (Fe-Ni) bimetallic catalysts exhibited selectivity towards the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation pathway (CO2-ODH) rather than the DRP.
5. Altering the nickel content in the bimetallic composition could modify the selectivity towards the DRP pathway when the atomic ratio of nickel exceeds 1.
6. A comprehensive bimetallic catalyst library was developed to identify catalysts inherently active for either DRP or CO2-ODH, which can be utilized for future enhancements in activity, stability, and selectivity.

1. 在二氧化碳和丙烷转化方面，镍基双金属催化剂（Ni3）在与铂（Pt1）和钯（Pd1）单金属相比时，表现出更高的转化率。
2. 镍基双金属催化剂不仅在活性方面更高，而且稳定性也更好。
3. 由金属钴和镍组成的催化剂显示出对干重整路径（DRP）的活性和选择性。
4. 铁镍（Fe-Ni）双金属催化剂表现出对二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢路径（CO2-ODH）的选择性，而不是DRP。
5. 当镍原子比超过1时，可以通过改变镍含量在双金属组成中调整选择性以偏向于DRP路径。
6. 开发了一个全面的双金属催化剂库，用于识别适用于DRP或CO2-ODH的催化剂，可以用于未来活动、稳定性和选择性的增强。
