[1] "The catalytic reduction of CO2 by propane may occur via dry reforming to produce syngas (CO + H2) or oxidative dehydrogenation to yield propylene."
[2] "Utilizing propane and CO2 as co-reactants presents several advantages over conventional methane dry reforming or direct propane dehydrogenation, including lower operating temperatures and less coke formation."
[3] "In this study, several precious and non-precious bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible CeO2 were investigated using flow reactor studies at 823 K to identify selective catalysts for CO2-assisted reforming and dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Bimetallic catalysts often show distinct electronic and chemical properties compared to their parent metals, providing an opportunity to design catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability."
[5] "Compared to Pt1, Fe3Pt1 showed lower steady state conversion and stability but with higher propylene selectivity."
[6] "Both Ni3 and Ni1 were active dry reforming catalysts."
[7] "The in situ XANES results revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe."
[8] "Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."
[9] "Doubling the catalyst metal loading but maintaining the 3:1 Fe to Ni ratio (Fe9Ni3) increased the conversion but negatively impacted the selectivity toward propylene (22.5% SC3H6 at 3.4% XC3H6)."
[10] "The FexNiy and to some extent the stability of the FexCoy system, the CoxNiy catalysts were not influenced."

1. The study investigates the use of bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2 for the CO2-assisted reforming and dehydrogenation of propane, aiming to identify selective catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to their parent metals. 
2. The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows higher propylene selectivity than Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which has lower selectivity towards propylene even at comparable propane conversion levels. 
3. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst is a promising system for CO2-ODH reactions, while the Fe1Ni3 catalyst favors the DRP pathway. 
4. Doubling the metal loading in Fe3Ni1 to Fe9Ni3 increases the conversion but negatively impacts the selectivity towards propylene. 
5. The CoxNiy catalysts, composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, are active and selective for the DRP pathway, unlike the FexNiy and FexCoy systems which are influenced by atomic composition and show selectivity towards CO2-ODH reactions.

1. 研究探讨了CeO2支持的双金属催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷重整和脱氢中的应用，旨在识别具有改进活性、选择性和稳定性的选择性催化剂，与它们的母金属相比。
2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂显示出比Fe1Ni3/CeO2更高的丙烯选择性，即使在丙烷转化率相当的情况下，Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂对丙烯的选择性较低。 
3. Fe3Ni1催化剂是CO2-ODH反应的有前景系统，而Fe1Ni3催化剂倾向于DRP途径。  
4. 将Fe3Ni1的金属负载加倍到Fe9Ni3可以增加转化率，但会负面影响丙烯选择性。 
5. CoxNiy催化剂由反应条件下的金属态Co和Ni组成，对于DRP途径表现出活性和选择性，而FexNiy和FexCoy系统则受原子组成的影响，并且表现出对CO2-ODH反应的选择性。
