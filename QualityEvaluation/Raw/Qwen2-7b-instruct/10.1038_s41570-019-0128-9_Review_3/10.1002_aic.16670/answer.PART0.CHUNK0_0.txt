[1] "Of the three transition metals examined with Pt1 and Pd1, Ni3 outperformed Fe3 and Co3 in terms of CO2 and propane conversions."
[2] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[3] "The CoxNiy catalyst, which are composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, were also active and selective for the DRP pathway."
[4] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[5] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."

The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare differently in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. 

Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with a composition of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni), exhibits selectivity towards CO2-ODH, which involves the reduction of CO2 to produce propylene. Its performance is influenced by the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni, with higher Ni content favoring the DRP pathway.

On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2, composed of nickel (Ni) and platinum (Pt), shows greater activity and stability in both CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. It demonstrates a preference for the DRP pathway, producing synthesis gas, due to its Pt-based composition.

Experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies suggest that the synergy between Ni and Pt in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 enhances its performance, leading to better selectivity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. The metallic forms of Co and Ni under reaction conditions in CoxNiy catalysts, particularly Co3Ni1, contribute to their selectivity for the DRP pathway.

The FexNiy catalysts, composed of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni), display selectivity towards CO2-ODH, with the Ni content influencing the catalyst's selectivity. Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 alters the catalyst's selectivity to favor the DRP pathway, enhancing its ability to produce synthesis gas from CO2 and propane.

Overall, the insights gained from these studies suggest that the choice of bimetallic catalyst composition, particularly the relative amounts of Ni and Pt or Co, plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 reduction pathways in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在丙烷与二氧化碳反应生成醇烯和合成气的反应中，它们的组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机制存在差异。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2，由铁（Fe）和镍（Ni）组成，表现出向二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）的选择性，即将二氧化碳还原为丙烯。其性能受到Fe和Ni原子比例的影响，高Ni含量倾向于促进裂解反应路径（DRP）。

相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2，由镍（Ni）和铂（Pt）组成，显示在CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的更高活性和稳定性。它倾向于DRP路径，产生合成气，由于其基于Pt的组成。

实验和理论（DFT）研究表明，Ni和Pt之间的协同作用增强了Ni3Pt1/CeO2的性能，导致更好的选择性和稳定性，与Fe3Ni1/CeO2相比。在反应条件下，CoxNiy催化剂中的Co和Ni以金属形式存在，特别是Co3Ni1，对DRP路径具有选择性贡献。

FexNiy催化剂，由铁（Fe）和镍（Ni）组成，显示出向CO2-ODH的选择性，Ni含量影响催化剂的选择性。增加Ni原子比至1以上改变催化剂的选择性，有利于DRP路径，增强其从二氧化碳和丙烷产生合成气的能力。

总体而言，这些研究揭示了选择双金属催化剂组成的含义，特别是Ni和Pt或Co的比例，对于确定二氧化碳减少途径的选择性和效率至关重要，在全球醇烯生产和二氧化碳排放减少的背景下。
