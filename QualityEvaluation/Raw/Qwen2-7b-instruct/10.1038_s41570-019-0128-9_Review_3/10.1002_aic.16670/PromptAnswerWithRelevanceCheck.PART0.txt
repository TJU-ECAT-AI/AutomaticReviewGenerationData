The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare differently in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. 

Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with a composition of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni), exhibits selectivity towards CO2-ODH, which involves the reduction of CO2 to produce propylene. Its performance is influenced by the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni, with higher Ni content favoring the DRP pathway.

On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2, composed of nickel (Ni) and platinum (Pt), shows greater activity and stability in both CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. It demonstrates a preference for the DRP pathway, producing synthesis gas, due to its Pt-based composition.

Experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies suggest that the synergy between Ni and Pt in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 enhances its performance, leading to better selectivity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. The metallic forms of Co and Ni under reaction conditions in CoxNiy catalysts, particularly Co3Ni1, contribute to their selectivity for the DRP pathway.

The FexNiy catalysts, composed of iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni), display selectivity towards CO2-ODH, with the Ni content influencing the catalyst's selectivity. Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 alters the catalyst's selectivity to favor the DRP pathway, enhancing its ability to produce synthesis gas from CO2 and propane.

Overall, the insights gained from these studies suggest that the choice of bimetallic catalyst composition, particularly the relative amounts of Ni and Pt or Co, plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 reduction pathways in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在丙烷与二氧化碳反应生成醇烯和合成气的反应中，它们的组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机制存在差异。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2，由铁（Fe）和镍（Ni）组成，表现出向二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）的选择性，即将二氧化碳还原为丙烯。其性能受到Fe和Ni原子比例的影响，高Ni含量倾向于促进裂解反应路径（DRP）。

相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2，由镍（Ni）和铂（Pt）组成，显示在CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的更高活性和稳定性。它倾向于DRP路径，产生合成气，由于其基于Pt的组成。

实验和理论（DFT）研究表明，Ni和Pt之间的协同作用增强了Ni3Pt1/CeO2的性能，导致更好的选择性和稳定性，与Fe3Ni1/CeO2相比。在反应条件下，CoxNiy催化剂中的Co和Ni以金属形式存在，特别是Co3Ni1，对DRP路径具有选择性贡献。

FexNiy催化剂，由铁（Fe）和镍（Ni）组成，显示出向CO2-ODH的选择性，Ni含量影响催化剂的选择性。增加Ni原子比至1以上改变催化剂的选择性，有利于DRP路径，增强其从二氧化碳和丙烷产生合成气的能力。

总体而言，这些研究揭示了选择双金属催化剂组成的含义，特别是Ni和Pt或Co的比例，对于确定二氧化碳减少途径的选择性和效率至关重要，在全球醇烯生产和二氧化碳排放减少的背景下。

[1] "Among the Pt and Pd based catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3 an improvement in both conversion and stability compared to the respective parent monometals was observed for Co3Pd1, Co3Pt1, and Ni3Pt1, shown in Figure 1."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts often show distinct electronic and chemical properties compared to their parent metals, providing an opportunity to design catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability."
[3] "Therefore, further bimetallic effect studies were performed with Co3Pt1 and Ni3Pt1. As shown in Figure 3, bimetallic Co3Pt1 and Ni3Pt1 showed higher conversion and stability compared to physical mixtures of the respective monometals (Co3+Pt1 and Ni3+Pt1), indicating that there was a synergistic interaction between Co-Pt and Ni-Pt when combined."
[4] "The Fe-containing catalysts with Pt1 and Pd1 were CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to produce propylene, but these combinations exhibited the lowest conversion."
[5] "Changing Fe3 to Co3 with Pt1 (Co3Pt1) not only increased the conversion to 20.3% CO2 and 5.6% C3H8 conversion, but also enhanced the dry reforming pathway with 88.8% CO selectivity."
[6] "Detailed kinetic measurements comparing the two most promising Pt based bimetallic catalysts, Ni3Pt1 and Co3Pt1, are shown in Figure 5. When examining the effect of increasing CO2 partial pressure with the CO2 consumption rate, it was evident that Ni3Pt1 consumed CO2 at a faster rate than Co3Pt1."
[7] "The Co3Ni1 catalyst showed higher steady state conversion over both reactants and improved stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, while keeping high CO selectivity that was comparable to Ni1 (but higher than Co3)."
[8] "In situ XANES measurements were conducted to examine the oxidation states of the catalysts under reaction conditions, shown in Figure 9. Ni3Pt1 had previously been examined and it was determined that the catalyst under reaction conditions consisted of metallic Ni and Pt."
[9] "The in situ XANES results revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state."

Answer: The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane as follows:

1. The Co3Pd1, Co3Pt1, and Ni3Pt1 bimetallic catalysts show improved conversion and stability compared to their parent monometals, according to the literature. This suggests that bimetallic systems can offer enhanced catalytic performance.

2. Bimetallic catalysts often exhibit distinct electronic and chemical properties that surpass their parent metals, enabling the design of catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. The Co3Pt1 and Ni3Pt1 bimetallic catalysts display higher conversion and stability compared to physical mixtures of their respective monometals. This indicates a synergistic interaction between Co-Pt and Ni-Pt, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

4. The Fe3Ni1 catalysts function as CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to produce propylene, but they exhibit the lowest conversion among the studied catalysts.

5. By substituting Fe3 with Co3 in the Pt1 system, the Co3Pt1 catalyst achieves a 20.3% CO2 conversion and 5.6% C3H8 conversion, while also improving the dry reforming pathway with 88.8% CO selectivity.

6. The Ni3Pt1 catalyst consumes CO2 at a faster rate than the Co3Pt1 catalyst under varying CO2 partial pressures, as indicated by kinetic measurements.

7. The Co3Ni1 catalyst shows superior conversion and stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, maintaining high CO selectivity that is on par with Ni1 but surpassing Co3.

8. In situ XANES measurements reveal that Ni3Pt1 consists of metallic Ni and Pt under reaction conditions, suggesting that it functions as a CO2-ODHP catalyst.

9. The DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also comprises metallic Ni and oxidized Fe, similar to the Fe3Ni1 catalyst. This implies that the selectivity differences among the Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts are not attributed to changes in oxidation state.

These findings highlight the potential of bimetallic catalysts in achieving higher conversion, stability, and selectivity for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, particularly when the metals in the bimetallic system interact synergistically. The selectivity towards CO2-ODHP versus DRP can be influenced by the type of metal combination, as well as the atomic ratio of the metals, offering opportunities for further optimization in catalytic performance.

1. 铁3镍1、钴3钯1、镍3铂1的双金属催化剂相较于其单一金属表现出改善的转化率和稳定性，文献中显示。这表明双金属体系能够提供增强的催化性能。

2. 双金属催化剂通常展现出与单一金属不同的电子和化学性质，使得设计具有更高活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂成为可能。

3. 钴3铂1和镍3铂1的双金属催化剂相比各自的单一金属物理混合物表现出更高的转化率和稳定性，这表明钴-铂和镍-铂之间存在协同作用，提高了催化效率。

4. 铁3镍1催化剂作为二氧化碳-ODH催化剂，由于其能够产生丙烯，但显示出最低的转化率，这是研究中发现的。

5. 将Fe3替换为Co3后，在铂1系统中，Co3铂1催化剂的二氧化碳转化率达到20.3%，丙烷转化率达到5.6%，同时增强了干重整路径的二氧化碳选择性达到88.8%。

6. 在不同二氧化碳分压下，镍3铂1催化剂的二氧化碳消耗速率比钴3铂1催化剂更快，这是通过动力学测量得出的结论。

7. 钴3镍1催化剂在两个反应物中表现出更高的转化率和稳定性，同时保持与镍1相似但高于钴3的二氧化碳选择性。

8. 原位XANES测量表明，镍3铂1催化剂在反应条件下由金属镍和铂组成，暗示其作为二氧化碳-ODH催化剂的功能。

9. 干重整铁1镍3催化剂也包含金属镍和氧化铁，类似于铁3镍1催化剂。这意味着铁-镍双金属催化剂的选择性差异不是由氧化状态变化造成的。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在实现二氧化碳-ODH和DRP反应更高转化率、稳定性和选择性的潜力，特别是当双金属系统中的金属之间表现出协同作用时。铁-镍组合类型以及金属原子比例的不同可以影响选择性向二氧化碳-ODH还是DRP的方向，提供了进一步优化催化性能的机会。
