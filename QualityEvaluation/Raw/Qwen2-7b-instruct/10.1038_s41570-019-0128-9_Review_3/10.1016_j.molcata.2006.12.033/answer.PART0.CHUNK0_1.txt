1. The ethylene was produced through both direct dehydrogenation of ethane and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, which can also be viewed as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

2. The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was notably higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, though their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower.

3. The Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst had the highest ethane and CO2 conversions, surpassing even the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, but it demonstrated the lowest selectivity to ethylene among the prepared catalysts.

4. The modifier influenced the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, the distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and the acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which collectively determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide.

1. 乙烯通过直接脱氢乙烷和与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢乙烷产生，这也可以视为乙烷脱氢反应与逆水煤气变换反应的结合。

2. Fe5-Cr10/Zr、Mn5-Cr10/Zr和Co5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂的乙烯选择性明显高于Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂，尽管它们的乙烷和CO2转化率较低。

3. Ni5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂具有最高的乙烷和CO2转化率，甚至超过了Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂，但它在制备的催化剂中显示出最低的乙烯选择性。

4. 改性剂影响了催化剂的纹理和结构特性，铬物种和氧物种的分布，以及催化剂表面的酸/碱性质，这些共同决定了改性Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂在以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷脱氢化过程中的催化活性。
