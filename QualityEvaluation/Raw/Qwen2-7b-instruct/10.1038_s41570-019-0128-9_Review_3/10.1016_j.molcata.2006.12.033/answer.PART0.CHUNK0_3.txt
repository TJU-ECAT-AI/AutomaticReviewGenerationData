[1] "Based on this result and other proposed reaction pathways [1,7], the overall reactions can be described as follows:
C2H6 C2H4 + H2
(1)
CO2 + H2 CO + H2O
(2)
C2H6 + CO2 C2H4 + CO + H2O
(3)
C2H6 + 2CO2 4CO + 3H2

[2] "Table 1 presents the catalytic conversions and selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenations of ethane with CO2 to ethylene over modified and unmodified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts at various temperatures."
[3] "The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2)."
[4] "The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst."
[5] "The Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst showed the highest ethane and CO2 conversions, much higher than even the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while it demonstrated the lowest selectivity to ethylene among the prepared catalysts."
[6] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

1. The overall reactions for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 include direct dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, and coupling with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

2. Table 1 details the catalytic performance of various Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 to ethylene.

3. Ethylene is produced through direct dehydrogenation of ethane and oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2.

4. The Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts showed higher ethylene selectivity compared to the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst.

5. The Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst had higher ethane and CO2 conversions but lower ethylene selectivity.

6. The modifiers' influence on catalyst properties determines the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts' activity in ethane dehydrogenation with CO2.
