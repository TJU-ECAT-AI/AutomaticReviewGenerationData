[1] "The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2)."
[2] "The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst."
[3] "The high yield of CO and high selectivity to methane indicated that the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst favored the reforming reaction (4) and the cracking reaction (5)."
[4] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

The comparison between the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 involves their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The study reveals that the catalysts' performance varies based on their specific composition and synergistic effects. 

Experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies offer insights into the catalysts' performance, including their stability, selectivity towards desired products, and the potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The nature of the modifier, whether it's Fe, Ni, Pt, or Pd, significantly influences the textural and structural properties of the catalyst, affecting the distribution of chromium species and oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This, in turn, determines the catalytic activity of the modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide.

The selectivity towards ethylene production is notably higher in the case of Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts compared to the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst. However, their conversions of ethane and CO2 are lower. On the other hand, the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst shows a high yield of CO and a high selectivity towards methane, indicating its preference for reforming and cracking reactions.

Answering the questions requires a detailed understanding of the document's content, focusing on the catalysts' compositions, selectivities, and the role of modifiers in shaping their performance. The document does not provide direct comparisons between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts, but rather discusses the broader implications of modifying catalysts with different metals for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. Insights into the catalysts' performance come from the document's analysis of the impact of modifiers on textural and structural properties, species distribution, and acid/base functionalities, which collectively determine catalytic activity.

比较双金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2涉及它们在丙烷CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机制。研究表明，催化剂性能根据其特定组成和协同效应而变化。

实验和理论（DFT）研究提供了有关催化剂性能的见解，包括稳定性、对所需产品的选择性以及在全球烯烃生产与二氧化碳排放减少背景下实现环境友好催化的可能性。修饰剂的性质，无论是Fe、Ni、Pt还是Pd，显著影响催化剂的纹理和结构特性，影响催化剂表面铬物种和氧物种的分布。这进而决定了修改后的Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂在二氧化碳乙烷脱氢化过程中的催化活性。

Fe5-Cr10/Zr、Mn5-Cr10/Zr和Co5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂的选择性相对于乙烯生产而言明显高于Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂。然而，它们的乙烷和二氧化碳转化率较低。另一方面，Ni5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂显示出较高的CO产率和高甲烷选择性，表明其倾向于重整和裂解反应。

回答问题需要深入了解文档内容，重点关注催化剂的组成、选择性及其修饰剂的作用。文档并未直接比较Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂，而是讨论了修改催化剂以用于CO2-ODH和DRP反应时的一般影响。有关催化剂性能的见解来自于对修饰剂如何影响纹理和结构特性、物种分布以及酸/碱功能性的分析，这些因素共同决定了催化活性。
