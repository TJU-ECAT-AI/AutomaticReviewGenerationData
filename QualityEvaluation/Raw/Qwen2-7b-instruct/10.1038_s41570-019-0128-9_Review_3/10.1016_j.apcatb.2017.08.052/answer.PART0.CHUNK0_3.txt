The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were evaluated for their effectiveness in converting propane to propylene through CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrated superior selectivity for propylene production relative to Ni3Pt1/CeO2. Both catalysts maintained enhanced stability during the CO2-ODH process. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations elucidated the reaction pathways for both catalysts. The synergistic interaction between the metals in the bimetallic catalysts was observed to boost their catalytic efficiency. The combination of experimental data and DFT studies indicated that these catalysts might provide a sustainable method for alkene synthesis and CO2 emission reduction.
