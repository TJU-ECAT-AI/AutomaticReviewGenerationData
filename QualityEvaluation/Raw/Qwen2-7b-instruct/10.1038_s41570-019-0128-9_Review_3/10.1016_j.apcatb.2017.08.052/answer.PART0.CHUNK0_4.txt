The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were studied for their performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated higher selectivity for propylene production and better stability under CO2-ODH conditions. DFT calculations suggested that the bimetallic structure aided in the activation of propane and subsequent dehydrogenation. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed a better synergy effect for CO2-ODH reaction, whereas the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst excelled in DRP, indicating distinct roles and efficiencies in these catalytic processes.

在当前的研究中，研究了两种二元催化剂：Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在丙烯生产选择性方面比Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂更高，并且在CO2-ODH条件下表现出增强的稳定性。第一性原理计算表明，这两种催化剂的二元结构有助于丙烷的活化以及随后的脱氢步骤。实验结果表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中具有更好的协同效应。相反，Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在直接还原丙烷热解（DRP）方面表现出色，这表明这两种催化剂在这些催化过程中的不同作用和效率。
