The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were studied for their performance in converting propane to propylene using CO2. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst was found to be superior to the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst in terms of propylene yield and CO2 conversion efficiency. The DFT calculations indicated that the Fe-Ni interaction in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst forms a more stable active site for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction compared to the Pt-Ni interaction in the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The synergistic effect between iron and nickel in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst enhances its ability to activate CO2 and promote propylene formation. Both catalysts showed good stability over multiple reaction cycles, suggesting their potential for practical use in CO2-ODH processes. These findings indicate that the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst could offer a sustainable solution for producing alkenes from CO2.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2双金属催化剂被研究用于使用CO2将丙烷转化为丙烯。实验结果显示，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在丙烯产率和CO2转化效率方面优于Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，Fe-Ni相互作用在Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂中形成更稳定的活性位点进行氧化脱氢（ODH）反应，而Pt-Ni相互作用在Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂中则不如此。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂中的铁镍协同效应增强了其激活CO2和促进丙烯形成的性能。两种催化剂均表现出良好的稳定性，多次反应周期后仍然稳定，这表明它们有可能在CO2-ODH过程中得到实际应用。这些发现表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂可能提供了一种可持续的方法来从CO2生产烯烃。
