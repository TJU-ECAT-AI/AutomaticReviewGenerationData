The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were evaluated for their effectiveness in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst exhibited superior selectivity for propylene production relative to the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. Both catalysts maintained good stability throughout the reaction. Theoretical analysis through density functional theory (DFT) elucidated the reaction pathways involved. The cooperative effects between the metals in the bimetallic catalysts were identified as essential for enhancing catalytic activity. These findings indicate promise for these catalysts in eco-friendly catalysis, supporting global alkene production and CO2 emission reduction.
