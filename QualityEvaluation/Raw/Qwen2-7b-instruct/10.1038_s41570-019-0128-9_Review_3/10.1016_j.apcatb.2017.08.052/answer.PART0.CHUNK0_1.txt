The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were studied for their efficiency in the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Experimental and theoretical (DFT) analyses revealed differences in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 was more selective for propylene production than Ni3Pt1/CeO2. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 displayed superior stability throughout the reaction. The synergy between the metals in the bimetallic catalysts was key to their performance. These catalysts showed promise for environmentally friendly catalysis, contributing to global alkene production and CO2 emission reduction.
