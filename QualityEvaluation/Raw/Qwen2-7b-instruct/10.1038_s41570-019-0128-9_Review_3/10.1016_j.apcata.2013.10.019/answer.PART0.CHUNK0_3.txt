[1] "Three catalysts have been investigated,i.e., 5%Rh on Al2O3,1%Co on Al2O3 and 0.5%Co0.5%Rh on Al2O3."
[2] "The Rh catalyst showed the highest hydroformylation and hydrogenation site time conversions in the investigated range of operating conditions."
[3] "On the Rh catalyst,higher ethylene feed concentrations have a more pronounced effect on CO conversion and production of propanal and propanol compared with an increase in the inlet concentration of the other reactants."

The study investigated three catalysts: 5%Rh on Al2O3, 1%Co on Al2O3, and 0.5%Co0.5%Rh on Al2O3. Among these, the Rh-based catalyst demonstrated superior performance in both hydroformylation and hydrogenation processes, showing the highest site time conversions under the examined operating conditions. Notably, increasing the ethylene feed concentration had a more significant impact on CO conversion and the production of propanal and propanol compared to enhancing the concentration of the other reactants on the Rh catalyst.

研究考察了三种催化剂：5%Rh在Al2O3上，1%Co在Al2O3上，以及0.5%Co0.5%Rh在Al2O3上。其中，铑基催化剂在所测试的操作条件下表现最佳，在氢化和氢形成过程中显示出最高的位时间转化率。值得注意的是，提高乙烯进料浓度对CO转化和丙醛、丙醇的生成的影响比增加其他反应物的进料浓度更为显著，这是在铑催化剂上的发现。
