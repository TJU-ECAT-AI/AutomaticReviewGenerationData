[1] "Three catalysts have been investigated, i.e., 5%Rh on Al2O3, 1%Co on Al2O3 and 0.5%Co0.5%Rh on Al2O3."
[2] "The Rh catalyst showed the highest hydroformylation and hydrogenation site time conversions in the investigated range of operating conditions."
[3] "Moreover it was found on all investigated catalysts that the hydrogenation activation energy was about 1520 kJ mol−1 higher than that for hydroformylation."
[4] "On the Rh catalyst, higher ethylene feed concentrations have a more pronounced effect on CO conversion and production of propanal and propanol compared with an increase in the inlet concentration of the other reactants."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document does not provide information on how the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, nor does it discuss insights from experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies regarding their performance, synergistic effects, and potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Therefore, no relevant quotes or answers can be provided for this question.
