[1] "Three catalysts have been investigated,i.e., 5%Rh on Al2O3,1%Co on Al2O3 and 0.5%Co0.5%Rh on Al2O3."
[2] "The main products observed were ethane, propanal, and propanol."
[3] "On the Rh catalyst, higher ethylene feed concentrations have a more pronounced effect on CO conversion and production of propanal and propanol compared with an increase in the inlet concentration of the other reactants."
[4] "Due to the high activation energies involved, the reaction rate remains rather low, however."
[5] "Cobalt complexes had been the main industrial hydroformylation catalysts until the early 1970s, i.e., prior to the commercialization of rhodium based catalysts."
[6] "This substitution became feasible because the high price of rhodium was offset by cheaper equipment, increased catalyst activity, and a generally higher selectivity and efficiency."
[7] "Commercially, homogeneous Co or Rh complexes are typically applied at temperatures ranging from as low as 360 K up to 573 K."
[8] "The successful implementation of an active and stable heterogeneous hydroformylation catalyst would allow avoiding these drawbacks."
[9] "Although the research into heterogeneously catalysed hydroformylation is in an early stage, a wide range of research activities has been performed on experimental heterogeneous hydroformylation with various reactants, catalysts, and operation conditions."
[10] "Reaction mechanism elucidation is an important subject in the reported heterogeneous hydroformylation studies."

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. It does, however, discuss the general principles of hydroformylation reactions, the use of Rh and Co catalysts, and the advantages and disadvantages of homogeneous versus heterogeneous catalysts. The studies mentioned focus on the development and optimization of heterogeneous hydroformylation catalysts, including the investigation of different catalyst compositions and operating conditions. Insights into the performance of such catalysts can be gained from experimental data, such as the conversion rates and product yields, as well as theoretical studies like density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which help understand the reaction pathways and potential synergistic effects between the metals. The literature highlights the importance of elucidating reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous hydroformylation studies to improve catalyst design and efficiency.

文献没有直接比较Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2两种双金属催化剂在CO2-ODH和DRP反应中与丙烷反应时的组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机制。它确实讨论了氢化合成反应的一般原理，Rh和Co催化剂的使用，以及均相催化剂与非均相催化剂之间的优缺点。提到的研究集中在非均相氢化合成催化剂的发展和优化，包括不同催化剂组成的实验研究和操作条件。从实验数据，如转化率和产物产率，以及理论研究，如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，可以获得这些催化剂性能的见解。文献强调了在非均相氢化合成研究中阐明反应机理的重要性，以改进催化剂设计和效率。
