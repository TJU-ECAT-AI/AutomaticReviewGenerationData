[1] "Intrinsic hydroformylation kinetics have been measured in a high-throughput kinetic test setup at temperatures varying from 448 to 498 K, with the total pressure ranging from 1 to 3 MPa."
[2] "Three catalysts have been investigated, i.e., 5%Rh on Al2O3, 1%Co on Al2O3, and 0.5%Co0.5%Rh on Al2O3."
[3] "The Rh catalyst showed the highest hydroformylation and hydrogenation site time conversions in the investigated range of operating conditions."
[4] "On the Rh catalyst, higher ethylene feed concentrations have a more pronounced effect on CO conversion and production of propanal and propanol compared with an increase in the inlet concentration of the other reactants."

The study investigated three catalysts for hydroformylation, focusing on the effects of temperature, pressure, and reactant concentrations on the conversion rates. The Rh-based catalyst demonstrated superior performance in terms of hydroformylation and hydrogenation site time conversions within the tested operational conditions. Increasing the concentration of ethylene had a more significant impact on CO conversion and the production of propanal and propanol on the Rh catalyst compared to the other reactants.

研究考察了三种催化剂的氢化成酯作用，关注温度、压力和反应物浓度对转化率的影响。铑基催化剂在测试的操作条件下表现出优越的氢化成酯和氢化位时间转换性能。增加乙烷浓度对铑催化剂上CO转化和丙醛及丙醇的生成影响更大，相较于其他反应物的进料浓度增加。
