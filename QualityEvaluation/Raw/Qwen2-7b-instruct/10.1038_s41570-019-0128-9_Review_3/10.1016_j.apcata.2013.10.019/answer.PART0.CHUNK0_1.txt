[1] "Three catalysts have been investigated, i.e., 5%Rh on Al2O3, 1%Co on Al2O3 and 0.5%Co0.5%Rh on Al2O3."
[2] "The main products observed were ethane, propanal, and propanol."
[3] "The Rh catalyst showed the highest hydroformylation and hydrogenation site time conversions in the investigated range of operating conditions."
[4] "Moreover, it was found on all investigated catalysts that the hydrogenation activation energy was about 1520 kJ mol−1 higher than that for hydroformylation."
[5] "On the Rh catalyst, higher ethylene feed concentrations have a more pronounced effect on CO conversion and production of propanal and propanol compared with an increase in the inlet concentration of the other reactants."

The study investigated three catalysts: 5%Rh on Al2O3, 1%Co on Al2O3, and 0.5%Co0.5%Rh on Al2O3. These catalysts were tested under varying conditions to produce ethane, propanal, and propanol. Among these, the Rh catalyst demonstrated superior hydroformylation and hydrogenation site time conversions across the examined operational parameters. Notably, the Rh catalyst also exhibited a notably higher hydrogenation activation energy compared to its hydroformylation counterpart. Furthermore, the Rh catalyst experienced a more significant impact on CO conversion and propanal/propanol production when the ethylene feed concentration was increased, relative to adjustments in the concentrations of other reactants.

研究考察了三种催化剂：5%Rh在Al2O3上，1%Co在Al2O3上，以及0.5%Co0.5%Rh在Al2O3上。在这些条件下测试这三种催化剂以生成乙烷、丙醛和丙醇。其中，铑催化剂在其所测试的操作参数范围内展现出最高的氢化合成和氢化位时间转化率。值得注意的是，与其它反应物入口浓度的增加相比，铑催化剂的氢化激活能显著高于其氢化合成。此外，当乙烯进料浓度增加时，铑催化剂对CO转化及丙醛/丙醇产量的影响更为明显。
