[1] "Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts have been prepared and tested for the direct synthesis of n-propanol from CO2 in presence of C2H4 and H2."
[2] "The conversion of CO2 increased with an increase in temperature from 473 K to 543 K, while the conversion of C2H4 was practically not affected but the selectivity to propanol decreased from 100 % to around 30 %."
[3] "The selectivity to propanol continuously increased with Cs loading (Fig. 3)."
[4] "For all shown catalysts, the selectivity to propanol on the basis of CO2 decreased with temperature but the strength of the decrease depended on Cs loading."
[5] "The conversion of CO2 strongly increased with temperature, while the ethylene conversion was less sensitive."
[6] "The selectivity to propanol based on C2H4 showed two different trends depending of Cs loading."
[7] "For benchmarking the Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts, we now compare their activity and selectivity with those of previously reported K-Au/TiO2 rutile and K- or Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase catalysts."

The document provides information on the direct synthesis of n-propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 using Cs-Au/TiO2 catalysts. The conversion of CO2 increases with temperature, while the conversion of C2H4 remains relatively constant. Selectivity to propanol improves with increased Cs loading, but decreases with increasing temperature. The selectivity to propanol varies depending on the type of catalyst and the Cs loading. The Cs-Au/TiO2 catalysts show better activity and selectivity compared to K-Au/TiO2 and K- or Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase catalysts.

文档提供了使用Cs-Au/TiO2催化剂直接从CO2、C2H4和H2合成n-丙醇的信息。随着温度的增加，CO2的转化率提高，而C2H4的转化率基本不变。丙醇的选择性随着Cs负载量的增加而改善，但随温度升高而降低。丙醇的选择性根据催化剂类型和Cs负载量的不同而变化。与K-Au/TiO2和K-或Cs-Au/TiO2锐钛矿催化剂相比，Cs-Au/TiO2催化剂显示出更好的活性和选择性。
