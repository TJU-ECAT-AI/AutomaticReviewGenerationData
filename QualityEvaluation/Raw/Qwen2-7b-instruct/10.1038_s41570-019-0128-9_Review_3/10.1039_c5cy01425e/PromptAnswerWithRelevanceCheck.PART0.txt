<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document provides information on the direct synthesis of n-propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 using Cs-Au/TiO2 catalysts. The conversion of CO2 increases with temperature, while the conversion of C2H4 remains relatively constant. Selectivity to propanol improves with increased Cs loading, but decreases with increasing temperature. The selectivity to propanol varies depending on the type of catalyst and the Cs loading. The Cs-Au/TiO2 catalysts show better activity and selectivity compared to K-Au/TiO2 and K- or Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase catalysts.

[1] "The present study elucidated various options for enhancing the production of propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 over Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts. The most active materials showed around two-times higher propanol yield than previously studied K-Au/TiO2 anatase/rutile and Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase."
[2] "The promoter affects both overall catalyst acidity and the formation of Auδ+, which are relevant for suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and propanol synthesis respectively."
[3] "Thus, following parameters should be taken into account for catalyst design:(i) high surface area supports with well-defined defects for the stabilization of small (< 1.5 nm) Au particles tending to the formation of Auδ+ and (ii) a decent surface acidity determined by the support and the promoter."
[4] "In terms of propanol yield and suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6, the reaction should be performed between 497 K and 523 K."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the production of propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 using Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts. The most active materials demonstrated a propanol yield that was approximately two times higher than those previously studied with K-Au/TiO2 anatase/rutile and Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase. The effectiveness of the catalysts is influenced by the support type, the kind of promoter, and its loading. The promoter impacts both the overall acidity of the catalyst and the formation of Auδ+, which are crucial for reducing non-favorable C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and enhancing propanol synthesis. For optimal performance, the reaction should be conducted within a temperature range of 497 K to 523 K. To design effective catalysts, consider having high surface area supports with defined defects for stabilizing small Au particles and forming Auδ+, and ensure a reasonable level of surface acidity determined by the support and the promoter.

本文讨论了使用Cs-Au/TiO2锐钛矿催化剂从CO2、C2H4和H2生产丙醇。活性最高的材料显示了大约两倍于之前研究的K-Au/TiO2锐钛矿/金红石和Cs-Au/TiO2金红石的丙醇产量。催化剂的有效性受到支持类型、促进剂种类及其负载的影响。促进剂影响催化剂的整体酸度和Auδ+的形成，这对于减少非期望的C2H4氢化为C2H6并增强丙醇合成至关重要。为了获得最佳性能，反应应在497 K至523 K的温度范围内进行。设计有效催化剂时，请考虑具有高表面面积、定义明确缺陷的支持物以稳定小于1.5 nm的Au颗粒，并形成Auδ+，以及确保由支持物和促进剂确定的合理表面酸度。

[2] "The support and the kind of promoter as well as its loading were established to be main factors determining catalysts performance. The promoter affects both overall catalyst acidity and the formation of Auδ+, which are relevant for suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and propanol synthesis respectively."
[3] "Thus, the following parameters should be taken into account for catalyst design:(i) high surface area supports with well-defined defects for the stabilization of small (< 1.5 nm) Au particles tending to the formation of Auδ+ and (ii) a decent surface acidity determined by the support and the promoter."
[4] "In terms of propanol yield and suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6, the reaction should be performed between 497 K and 523 K. This catalyst performance can be further improved when performing the reaction using feeds with partial pressures of the reactants ranked as p(CO2) << p(H2) < p(C2H4)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts produced propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 with a yield around two times higher than K-Au/TiO2 anatase/rutile and Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase catalysts. The performance of these catalysts was mainly influenced by the type of support and the promoter along with its loading. The promoter's impact was twofold, affecting both the overall catalyst acidity and the formation of Auδ+, which is crucial for reducing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and enhancing propanol synthesis.

2. For designing catalysts, two key aspects should be considered: the presence of high surface area supports with specific defects to stabilize small Au particles, promoting Auδ+ formation, and maintaining a sufficient surface acidity provided by the support and the promoter.

3. For achieving high propanol yield and minimizing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6, the reaction should be conducted within the temperature range of 497 K to 523 K. Optimizing the feed composition with CO2 having the lowest partial pressure, followed by H2, and then C2H4, can further enhance the catalyst's performance.

1.Xs-Au/TiO2锐钛矿催化剂从CO2、C2H4和H2中生产丙醇的产率约为K-Au/TiO2板钛矿/锐钛矿和Xs-Au/TiO2板钛矿催化剂的两倍。这些催化剂的性能主要由支撑物类型和促进剂及其负载决定。促进剂的影响具有双重性，既影响催化剂的整体酸性，也影响Auδ+的形成，这对于减少非预期的C2H4氢化为C2H6并提高丙醇合成至关重要。

2.在设计催化剂时，应考虑两个关键方面：存在高表面面积支持物，带有特定缺陷以稳定小于1.5 nm的Au颗粒，并促进Auδ+的形成，以及由支撑物和促进剂提供的足够的表面酸性。

3.为了实现高丙醇产率并减少非期望的C2H4氢化为C2H6，反应应在497 K至523 K的温度范围内进行。通过优化反应物的组成，使CO2的分压最低，然后是H2，最后是C2H4，可以进一步提高催化剂的性能。
