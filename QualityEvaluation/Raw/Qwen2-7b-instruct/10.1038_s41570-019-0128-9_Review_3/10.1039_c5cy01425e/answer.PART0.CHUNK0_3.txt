[1] "The present study elucidated various options for enhancing the production of propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 over Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts. The most active materials showed around two-times higher propanol yield than previously studied K-Au/TiO2 anatase/rutile and Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase."
[2] "The support and the kind of promoter as well as its loading were established to be main factors determining catalysts performance. The promoter affects both overall catalyst acidity and the formation of Auδ+, which are relevant for suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and propanol synthesis respectively."
[3] "Thus, the following parameters should be taken into account for catalyst design:(i) high surface area supports with well-defined defects for the stabilization of small (< 1.5 nm) Au particles tending to the formation of Auδ+ and (ii) a decent surface acidity determined by the support and the promoter."
[4] "In terms of propanol yield and suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6, the reaction should be performed between 497 K and 523 K. This catalyst performance can be further improved when performing the reaction using feeds with partial pressures of the reactants ranked as p(CO2) << p(H2) < p(C2H4)."

1. The Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts produced propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 with a yield around two times higher than K-Au/TiO2 anatase/rutile and Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase catalysts. The performance of these catalysts was mainly influenced by the type of support and the promoter along with its loading. The promoter's impact was twofold, affecting both the overall catalyst acidity and the formation of Auδ+, which is crucial for reducing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and enhancing propanol synthesis.

2. For designing catalysts, two key aspects should be considered: the presence of high surface area supports with specific defects to stabilize small Au particles, promoting Auδ+ formation, and maintaining a sufficient surface acidity provided by the support and the promoter.

3. For achieving high propanol yield and minimizing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6, the reaction should be conducted within the temperature range of 497 K to 523 K. Optimizing the feed composition with CO2 having the lowest partial pressure, followed by H2, and then C2H4, can further enhance the catalyst's performance.

1.Xs-Au/TiO2锐钛矿催化剂从CO2、C2H4和H2中生产丙醇的产率约为K-Au/TiO2板钛矿/锐钛矿和Xs-Au/TiO2板钛矿催化剂的两倍。这些催化剂的性能主要由支撑物类型和促进剂及其负载决定。促进剂的影响具有双重性，既影响催化剂的整体酸性，也影响Auδ+的形成，这对于减少非预期的C2H4氢化为C2H6并提高丙醇合成至关重要。

2.在设计催化剂时，应考虑两个关键方面：存在高表面面积支持物，带有特定缺陷以稳定小于1.5 nm的Au颗粒，并促进Auδ+的形成，以及由支撑物和促进剂提供的足够的表面酸性。

3.为了实现高丙醇产率并减少非期望的C2H4氢化为C2H6，反应应在497 K至523 K的温度范围内进行。通过优化反应物的组成，使CO2的分压最低，然后是H2，最后是C2H4，可以进一步提高催化剂的性能。
