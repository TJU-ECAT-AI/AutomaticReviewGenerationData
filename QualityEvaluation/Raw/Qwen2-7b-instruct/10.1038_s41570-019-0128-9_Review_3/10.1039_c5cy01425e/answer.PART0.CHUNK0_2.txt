[1] "Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts have been prepared and tested for the direct synthesis of n-propanol from CO2 in presence of C2H4 and H2."
[2] "The conversion of CO2 increased with an increase in temperature from 473 K to 543 K, while the conversion of C2H4 was practically not affected but the selectivity to propanol decreased from 100 % to around 30 %."
[3] "The conversion of CO2 strongly increased with temperature, while the ethylene conversion was less sensitive."
[4] "For all shown catalysts, the selectivity to propanol on the basis of CO2 decreased with temperature but the strength of the decrease depended on Cs loading."
[5] "The selectivity to propanol based on C2H4 is practically not influenced by the ratio of H2/(CO2+C2H4)."
[6] "Despite the fact that the feeds with the ratio of H2/(CO2+C2H4) of 0.67 and 1 had the same ratio of H2/CO2 of 2, different degrees of CO2 conversion were obtained."
[7] "The selectivity to propanol based on CO2 initially increased with this ratio and passed a maximum at the ratio of 0.67."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Cs-Au/TiO2 catalysts were used for synthesizing n-propanol from CO2 with C2H4 and H2.
2. Increasing temperature from 473 K to 543 K led to higher CO2 conversion but decreased the selectivity to propanol from 100% to around 30%.
3. Temperature had a greater effect on CO2 conversion than on ethylene conversion.
4. Selectivity to propanol based on CO2 decreased with temperature, with the strength of the decrease varying by Cs loading.
5. Selectivity to propanol based on C2H4 was not influenced by the ratio of H2/(CO2+C2H4).
6. Despite having the same H2/CO2 ratio, different CO2 conversions were observed for feeds with ratios of 0.67 and 1.
7. Selectivity to propanol based on CO2 increased with the ratio of H2/(CO2+C2H4) and reached a maximum at 0.67.

1. Cs-Au/TiO2催化剂用于从CO2、C2H4和H2合成n-丙醇。
2. 温度从473 K增加到543 K导致CO2转化率升高，但选择性降低至约30%，从100%下降。
3. 温度对CO2转化率的影响大于对乙烯转化率的影响。
4. 根据CO2计算的丙醇选择性随温度降低，强度取决于铯加载量。
5. 根据C2H4计算的丙醇选择性不受H2/(CO2+C2H4)比例的影响。
6. 尽管具有相同的H2/CO2比例，但对于具有0.67和1比值的饲料，观察到了不同的CO2转化率。
7. 根据CO2计算的丙醇选择性随H2/(CO2+C2H4)比例增加，并在0.67时达到最大。
