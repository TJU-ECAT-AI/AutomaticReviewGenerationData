[1] "The present study elucidated various options for enhancing the production of propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 over Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts. The most active materials showed around two-times higher propanol yield than previously studied K-Au/TiO2 anatase/rutile and Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase."
[2] "The promoter affects both overall catalyst acidity and the formation of Auδ+, which are relevant for suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and propanol synthesis respectively."
[3] "Thus, following parameters should be taken into account for catalyst design:(i) high surface area supports with well-defined defects for the stabilization of small (< 1.5 nm) Au particles tending to the formation of Auδ+ and (ii) a decent surface acidity determined by the support and the promoter."
[4] "In terms of propanol yield and suppressing non-desired C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6, the reaction should be performed between 497 K and 523 K."

The document discusses the production of propanol from CO2, C2H4, and H2 using Cs-Au/TiO2 rutile catalysts. The most active materials demonstrated a propanol yield that was approximately two times higher than those previously studied with K-Au/TiO2 anatase/rutile and Cs-Au/TiO2 anatase. The effectiveness of the catalysts is influenced by the support type, the kind of promoter, and its loading. The promoter impacts both the overall acidity of the catalyst and the formation of Auδ+, which are crucial for reducing non-favorable C2H4 hydrogenation to C2H6 and enhancing propanol synthesis. For optimal performance, the reaction should be conducted within a temperature range of 497 K to 523 K. To design effective catalysts, consider having high surface area supports with defined defects for stabilizing small Au particles and forming Auδ+, and ensure a reasonable level of surface acidity determined by the support and the promoter.

本文讨论了使用Cs-Au/TiO2锐钛矿催化剂从CO2、C2H4和H2生产丙醇。活性最高的材料显示了大约两倍于之前研究的K-Au/TiO2锐钛矿/金红石和Cs-Au/TiO2金红石的丙醇产量。催化剂的有效性受到支持类型、促进剂种类及其负载的影响。促进剂影响催化剂的整体酸度和Auδ+的形成，这对于减少非期望的C2H4氢化为C2H6并增强丙醇合成至关重要。为了获得最佳性能，反应应在497 K至523 K的温度范围内进行。设计有效催化剂时，请考虑具有高表面面积、定义明确缺陷的支持物以稳定小于1.5 nm的Au颗粒，并形成Auδ+，以及确保由支持物和促进剂确定的合理表面酸度。
