<cite>Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %,was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2.</cite>
<cite>The obtained catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption,and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) methods and the results showed that the large surface area of MSU-1 was favorable for the dispersion of VOx species and the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. %.</cite>
<cite>Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%) and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions.</cite>
<cite>In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1.</cite>
<cite>The catalysts containing vanadium were found to have excellent catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation reaction.</cite>
<cite>Research of Ma et al. [25] on V2O5/Al2O3 and V2O5/SiO2 catalyst showed that vanadium species with higher dispersion had better catalytic activity.</cite>
<cite>However, the traditional carriers, such as Al2O3 and SiO2,possessed low specific surface area, small pore size and wide pore size distribution, which restricted the activity of catalysts.</cite>
<cite>MSU-x is an important family of mesoporous material, with 3D worm-like holes, which possess many advantages of pore structure and is in favor of the diffusion of molecular objects.</cite>
<cite>The pore diameter distribution of different samples was shown in Figure 2, which was determined by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.</cite>
<cite>H2TPR patternsofundopedMSU1andVOx/MSU1catalystswithdifferentVOxloadingwere comparativelyshowninFigure3.</cite>
<cite>Undoped MSU-1 exhibited low catalytic activity in comparison to VOx-doped samples, with 11.8% conversion of isobutane (i-C4H10) and 52.5% selectivity of isobutene (i-C4H8).</cite>
<cite>The catalytic performance of VOx/MSU-1 with different VOx loading for the isobutane dehydrogenation were shown in Table 2.</cite>

<cite>Reaction conditions: reaction temperature 873 K, total flow rate 24 mL/min, catalyst 0.2 g, V(CO2):V(i-C4H10) = 3:1;* V(Ar):V(i-C4H10) = 3:1.</cite>
<cite>As the reaction proceeded, the isobutane conversion of dehydrogenation gave a visible drop, either in the presence of or in the absence of CO2, suggesting that the catalyst was deactivated to some degree.</cite>
<cite>For example, the conversion of isobutane decreased from primal 58.8% to 44.2% with CO2 and 40.5% to 21.9% without CO2, respectively, after reacting for 3 h.</cite>
<cite>This was due to that CO2 in the reaction stream could suppress the formation of coke deposited over VOx/MSU-1 [17,37,38].</cite>
<cite>Moreover, from Figure 5, it could also be seen that the selectivity to isobutene gave a slight increase with proceeding reaction, especially with CO2.</cite>

The study focuses on the development of a vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1 as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-temperature programmed reduction methods. The optimal loading of vanadium oxide was found to be 12.0 wt. %, leading to the highest catalytic activity with 58.8% conversion of isobutane and 78.5% selectivity of isobutene under optimal reaction conditions. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream enhanced the dehydrogenation of isobutane and improved the stability of the catalyst. The study also highlights the importance of the carrier material, MSU-1, in facilitating the dispersion of vanadium oxide species and improving the catalytic performance. The results suggest that the developed catalyst could potentially be used in the production of isobutene and contribute to reducing CO2 emissions.
