[1] "The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume."
[3] "As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity,with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K."
[4] "In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, optimized with a VOx loading of 12.0 wt. %, demonstrated high activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. This loading resulted in the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals, leading to a decrease in surface area and pore volume. Consequently, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity, achieving a conversion of isobutane at 58.8% and a selectivity of isobutene at 78.5% at 873 K. The presence of CO2 in the feedstream significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation efficiency, enabling the removal of hydrogen generated during the reaction via the RWGS reaction, while simultaneously preventing coke deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst.

在MSU-1上负载的VOx催化剂，通过加载12.0 wt. %的VOx优化，在使用CO2氧化脱氢异丁烷中表现出高活性和选择性。这种加载导致形成更大块状的VOx晶体，表面面积和孔体积下降。因此，12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1展现出最高的催化活性，异丁烷转化率为58.8%，异丁烯选择性为78.5%，在873 K下。反应物流中的CO2的存在在脱氢异丁烷中扮演着重要角色，不仅能够通过RWGS反应去除反应产生的氢气，同时还能防止焦炭沉积并提高催化剂的稳定性。
