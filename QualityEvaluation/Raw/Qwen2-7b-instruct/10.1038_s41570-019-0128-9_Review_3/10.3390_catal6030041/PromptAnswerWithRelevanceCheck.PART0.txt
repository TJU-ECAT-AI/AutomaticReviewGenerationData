[1] "The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1."
[3] "XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume."
[4] "As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity, with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K."
[5] "In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane,"
[6] "which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were designed to be effective and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The performance of these catalysts was influenced by the loading of VOx and the large surface area provided by MSU-1. An optimal loading of 12.0 wt. % VOx was identified, which facilitated the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals. This led to a decrease in the surface area and pore volume. Consequently, the catalyst with 12.0 wt. % VOx loading showed the highest catalytic activity, achieving a conversion of isobutane to 58.8% and a selectivity of isobutene to 78.5% at a reaction temperature of 873 K. Additionally, the presence of CO2 in the feed stream played a crucial role in enhancing the dehydrogenation process. CO2 helped to eliminate hydrogen produced during the reaction via the RWGS reaction, suppressed the formation of coke deposits, and improved the stability of the VOx/MSU-1 catalyst.

In the study, vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1 was synthesized as a highly active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR methods. The optimal loading of vanadium oxide was found to be 12.0 wt. %, which resulted in the highest catalytic activity with a conversion of isobutane at 58.8% and a selectivity of isobutene at 78.5%.

[1] "The conversion of isobutane gradually increased with VOx loading, and reached maximum value, 58.8% (Entry 4), when VOx loading was 12 wt. %. While VOx loading further increased to 17.5 wt. %, the conversion of isobutane begun to decrease to 51.0% (Entry 6)."
[2] "The selectivity of isobutene did not exhibit obvious change in a certain extent with the increase of VOx loading, basically keeping at 79% or so."
[3] "The presence of CO2 significantly enhanced the efficiency of isobutane dehydrogenation, which was generally attributed to that CO2 as a weak oxidant could eliminate hydrogen produced during the dehydrogenation through RWGS reaction."
[4] "Moreover, CO2 can eliminate coke deposited over the catalysts, to some extent, and improve the stability of catalysts."
[5] "The conversion of isobutane gradually increased as the reaction temperature was raised, whereas the selectivity of isobutene, the object product, decreased on the contrary."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The conversion of isobutane rose with increasing VOx loading, reaching its peak at 58.8% (Entry 4) with a 12 wt. % VOx load. Further increasing the VOx loading to 17.5 wt. % led to a decline in isobutane conversion to 51.0% (Entry 6). The selectivity for isobutene remained largely unchanged despite VOx loading increases, staying around 79%. CO2 notably enhanced the isobutane dehydrogenation efficiency, primarily by removing hydrogen through the RWGS reaction, which also helped mitigate coke deposition on the catalysts and improved their stability. As the reaction temperature increased, the conversion of isobutane grew, yet the selectivity for the desired product, isobutene, decreased conversely.

异丁烷的转化率随VOX负载量的增加而逐渐提高，当VOX负载量达到12 wt. %时，其峰值达到了58.8%（第4条）。进一步增加VOX负载量至17.5 wt. %后，异丁烷转化率开始下降至51.0%（第6条）。尽管随着VOX负载量的增加，异丁烯的选择性基本保持在79%左右不变。CO2显著提高了异丁烷脱氢的效率，主要通过消除脱氢过程中产生的氢气，结合逆水煤气变换反应。此外，CO2还可以部分清除沉积在催化剂上的焦炭，从而改善催化剂的稳定性。随着反应温度的升高，异丁烷的转化率逐渐增加，然而目标产物异丁烯的选择性则相反地降低。

[1] "The pore diameter distribution of different samples was shown in Figure 2, which was determined by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method."
[2] "Moreover, with VOx content increasing, the peak shape gradually moved to the left, as a whole, and the width of peak also increased in the meantime."
[3] "When VOx loading reached 17.5 wt. %, the peak had moved to 1.8 nm from 2.2 nm, which suggested that some pores of MSU-1 might be partly occupied by vanadium oxides, resulting in smaller pore size."
[4] "As a result, the pore size distribution of VOx/MSU-1 catalysts were broadened and the surface area and pore volume were decreased."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The pore size distribution of various samples was depicted in Figure 2, which was determined using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. As the VOX content increased, the peak shape shifted to the left overall, and the peak width also expanded simultaneously. Upon reaching a VOX loading of 17.5 wt. %, the peak position moved from 2.2 nm to 1.8 nm, indicating that some pores of MSU-1 might have been partially filled by vanadium oxides, leading to a reduction in pore size. Consequently, the pore size distribution of the VOX/MSU-1 catalysts became broader, and both the surface area and pore volume were diminished.

不同样品的孔径分布图在图2中展示，使用Barrett-Joyner-Halenda（BJH）方法确定。随着VOX含量的增加，峰形状整体向左移动，并且同时峰宽也扩大。当VOX负载量达到17.5 wt. %时，峰位置从2.2 nm移动到1.8 nm，这表明MSU-1的一些孔可能被部分占据，导致孔径减小。因此，VOX/MSU-1催化剂的孔径分布变得更宽，表面面积和孔体积均减少。
