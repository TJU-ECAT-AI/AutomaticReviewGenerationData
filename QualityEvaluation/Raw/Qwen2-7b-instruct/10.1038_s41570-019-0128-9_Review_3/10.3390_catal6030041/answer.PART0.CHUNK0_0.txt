[1] "The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1."
[3] "XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume."
[4] "As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity, with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K."
[5] "In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane,"
[6] "which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were designed to be effective and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The performance of these catalysts was influenced by the loading of VOx and the large surface area provided by MSU-1. An optimal loading of 12.0 wt. % VOx was identified, which facilitated the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals. This led to a decrease in the surface area and pore volume. Consequently, the catalyst with 12.0 wt. % VOx loading showed the highest catalytic activity, achieving a conversion of isobutane to 58.8% and a selectivity of isobutene to 78.5% at a reaction temperature of 873 K. Additionally, the presence of CO2 in the feed stream played a crucial role in enhancing the dehydrogenation process. CO2 helped to eliminate hydrogen produced during the reaction via the RWGS reaction, suppressed the formation of coke deposits, and improved the stability of the VOx/MSU-1 catalyst.

VOx/MSU-1催化剂被设计用于以CO2为辅助剂的异丁烷氧化脱氢反应，具有良好的选择性。这些催化剂的性能受到VOx负载量和MSU-1的大比表面积的影响。在12.0 wt. %的VOx最佳负载下，促进了更大块状VOx晶体的形成，导致表面面积和孔体积的下降。因此，12.0 wt. % VOx负载的催化剂表现出最高的催化活性，异丁烷转化率为58.8%，异丁烯选择性为78.5%，反应温度为873 K。此外，在反应流中加入CO2起到了关键作用，帮助通过水煤气变换反应去除反应产生的氢气，抑制焦炭沉积的形成，并提高了VOx/MSU-1催化剂的稳定性。
