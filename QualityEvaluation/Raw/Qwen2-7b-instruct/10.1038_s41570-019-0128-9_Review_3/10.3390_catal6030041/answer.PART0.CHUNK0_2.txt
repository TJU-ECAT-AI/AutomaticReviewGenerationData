[1] "In conclusion, the catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1."
[3] "XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume."
[4] "As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity, with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K."
[5] "In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

The VOx/MSU-1 catalysts are effective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2, with their activity and selectivity influenced by the VOx loading and the high surface area of MSU-1. An optimal VOx loading of 12.0 wt. % was identified, as this resulted in the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals, leading to a decrease in surface area and pore volume. Consequently, the 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity, achieving 58.8% conversion of isobutane and 78.5% selectivity of isobutene at 873 K. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream plays a crucial role, facilitating the removal of H2 through the RWGS reaction and inhibiting coke formation, thereby enhancing the stability of the VOx/MSU-1 catalyst.

VOx/MSU-1催化剂在以CO2为氧化剂的异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性，其活性和选择性受到VOx负载量和MSU-1高比表面积的影响。确定最佳的VOx负载量为12.0 wt. %，因为这种情况下形成了更大的类似块体的VOx晶体，导致表面积和孔体积的下降。因此，12.0 wt. %的VOx/MSU-1催化剂显示出最高的催化活性，在873 K时实现了异丁烷58.8%的转化率和异丁烯78.5%的选择性。反应流中的CO2发挥了重要作用，通过RWGS反应去除生成的H2，并抑制焦炭沉积，从而提高VOx/MSU-1催化剂的稳定性。
