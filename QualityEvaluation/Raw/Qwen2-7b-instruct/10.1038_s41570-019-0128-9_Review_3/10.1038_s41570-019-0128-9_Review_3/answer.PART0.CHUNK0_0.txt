"CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10 Just as experimental and DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2+C2H6, a similar treatment can be done for CO2+C3H8 at 823K."
"The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101)."
"The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
"The average metal particle sizes of the Ni3Pt/CeO2 (2.3-nm particles, from TEM) and Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (<2-nm particles, from in situ XRD) systems are small."
"Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
"Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced."
"Plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity for Fe3Ni1 and Ni3Pt1 can also clarify the intrinsic activity of the catalysts for CO2-ODHP or DRP."
"In the case of Ni3Pt1, the high value of the y-intercept of CO selectivity (97%) suggests that it is a typical reforming catalyst, while the same cannot be said for Fe3Ni1 (22.2%)."
"Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."
"According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS."
"Of the other bimetallic systems examined, only FeCo catalysts illustrated a preference to form C3H6, albeit before undergoing a rapid deactivation."
"The knowledge that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 comprises Ni0 and oxidized Fe motivated a DFT study into both bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) and the FeONi(111) interface."
"Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, consistent with the results obtained for the reactions of CO2 and C3H8."
"In situ XANES measurements of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts indicate that its Ni centres are metallic, whereas Fe mainly exists as FeOx (ref.103)."
"The combined experimental and theoretical methods discussed here can be used to identify descriptors such as oxidation state, nature of oxygenated intermediates and *O binding energy."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct properties and performances in the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates a 58% selectivity for C3H6 with notable stability, whereas Ni3Pt1/CeO2 shows exceptional reactivity with 96% selectivity for CO in DRP. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 operates through a synergistic effect between iron and nickel, leading to better performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is recognized as a typical reforming catalyst. The catalysts' intrinsic activities can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, revealing differences in their performance. The in situ XANES measurements highlight that Ni3Pt/CeO2 contains Pt in a zero valence state, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni in a zero valence state. The presence of oxidized Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 is confirmed by in situ EXAFS. The catalysts' selectivity and activity are influenced by their oxidation states, the nature of oxygenated intermediates, and the binding energy of *O. Understanding these factors through combined experimental and theoretical approaches can lead to the development of safer and more selective catalysts for the CO2-ODH of light alkanes.

在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中，Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2这两种双金属催化剂表现出不同的特性和性能。Fe3Ni1/CeO2对于C3H6的选择性为58%，具有良好的稳定性，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP中的选择性高达96%。Fe3Ni1/CeO2通过铁和镍之间的协同效应，相较于它们的单金属催化剂表现出更好的性能。另一方面，Ni3Pt1/CeO2被识别为典型的重整催化剂。通过将CO2转化率与CO选择性进行绘图，可以评估催化剂的内在活性，揭示它们的性能差异。原位XANES测量表明，Ni3Pt/CeO2中铂处于零价态，而Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2均包含Ni在零价态。Fe3Ni/CeO2中氧化态的Fe的存在得到了原位EXAFS的独立确认。催化剂的选择性和活性受到其氧化状态、氧代中间体的性质以及*O结合能的影响。通过结合实验和理论方法理解这些因素，可以推动轻烷烃CO2-ODH催化体系的发展，以实现更安全和更选择性的催化剂设计。
