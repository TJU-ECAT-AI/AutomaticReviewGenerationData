[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively."

[3] "Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced."

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were identified as effective catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows good stability and a high C3H6 selectivity of 58%, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is highly active for DRP with a CO selectivity of 96%. The CO2-ODH process leads to a net reduction of CO2, unlike processes involving oxygen where CO2 production occurs due to over-oxidation.
2. Intrinsic activity of the catalysts for CO2-ODH or DRP can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity for Fe3Ni1 and Ni3Pt1.
3. The binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are comparable, with intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface.
4. In situ XANES measurements reveal that Ni3Pt/CeO2 contains Pt in its zero valence state, and both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 have metallic Ni centers. Contrarily, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 is found in oxidized forms.
5. Ni centers in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts are metallic, whereas Fe mainly exists as FeOx based on in situ XANES measurements.

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2分别被识别为CO2-ODH和丙烷DRP反应的有效催化剂。Fe3Ni1/CeO2表现出良好的稳定性，C3H6选择性高达58%，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP中高度活跃，CO选择性达到96%。CO2-ODH过程导致CO2净减少，与使用氧气的过程不同，后者由于过氧化导致CO2产生。
2. 通过绘制Fe3Ni1和Ni3Pt1的CO2转化率与CO选择性之间的关系，可以评估催化剂对CO2-ODH或DRP的内在活性。
3. Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面的中间体结合配置相似，所有中间体更强烈地结合到Fe3Ni(111)表面。
4. 在原位XANES测量中发现，Ni3Pt/CeO2包含零价态的Pt，而Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2具有金属Ni中心。相反，Fe3Ni/CeO2中的Fe存在于氧化形式。
5. 根据原位XANES测量，FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的Ni中心是金属的，而Fe主要以FeOx的形式存在。
