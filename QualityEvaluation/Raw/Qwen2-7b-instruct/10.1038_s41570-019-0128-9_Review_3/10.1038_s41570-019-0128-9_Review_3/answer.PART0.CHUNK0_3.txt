Just as experimental and DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2+C2H6, a similar treatment can be done for CO2+C3H8 at 823K.
The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101).
The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8).
The average metal particle sizes of the Ni3Pt/CeO2 (2.3-nm particles, from TEM) and Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (<2-nm particles, from in situ XRD) systems are small.
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO.
Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically.
In situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0.
By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102.
Of the other bimetallic systems examined, only FeCo catalysts illustrated a preference to form C3H6, albeit before undergoing a rapid deactivation.
According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0.

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is highly active for DRP with 96% CO selectivity. The two catalysts exhibit small average metal particle sizes (2.3 nm for Ni3Pt/CeO2 and <2 nm for Fe3Ni1/CeO2). Fe3Ni1/CeO2 operates synergistically with Ni and Fe, demonstrating higher C3H6 yield compared to individual monometallic catalysts. The catalysts are characterized by Pt0 and Ni0 according to in situ XANES measurements.

2. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst exhibits a higher C3H6 selectivity (58%) with good stability, whereas the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst shows high activity for DRP with 96% CO selectivity. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 leads to a higher C3H6 yield compared to individual monometallic catalysts. Both catalysts have small metal particle sizes, and their active sites are characterized by Pt0 and Ni0, respectively.
