"CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10 Just as experimental and DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2+C2H6, a similar treatment can be done for CO2+C3H8 at 823K."
"The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101)."
"The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
"The average metal particle sizes of the Ni3Pt/CeO2 (2.3-nm particles, from TEM) and Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (<2-nm particles, from in situ XRD) systems are small."
"Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
"Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced."
"Plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity for Fe3Ni1 and Ni3Pt1 can also clarify the intrinsic activity of the catalysts for CO2-ODHP or DRP."
"In the case of Ni3Pt1, the high value of the y-intercept of CO selectivity (97%) suggests that it is a typical reforming catalyst, while the same cannot be said for Fe3Ni1 (22.2%)."
"Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."
"According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS."
"Of the other bimetallic systems examined, only FeCo catalysts illustrated a preference to form C3H6, albeit before undergoing a rapid deactivation."
"The knowledge that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 comprises Ni0 and oxidized Fe motivated a DFT study into both bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) and the FeONi(111) interface."
"Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, consistent with the results obtained for the reactions of CO2 and C3H8."
"In situ XANES measurements of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts indicate that its Ni centres are metallic, whereas Fe mainly exists as FeOx (ref.103)."
"The combined experimental and theoretical methods discussed here can be used to identify descriptors such as oxidation state, nature of oxygenated intermediates and *O binding energy."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct properties and performances in the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates a 58% selectivity for C3H6 with notable stability, whereas Ni3Pt1/CeO2 shows exceptional reactivity with 96% selectivity for CO in DRP. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 operates through a synergistic effect between iron and nickel, leading to better performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is recognized as a typical reforming catalyst. The catalysts' intrinsic activities can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, revealing differences in their performance. The in situ XANES measurements highlight that Ni3Pt/CeO2 contains Pt in a zero valence state, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni in a zero valence state. The presence of oxidized Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 is confirmed by in situ EXAFS. The catalysts' selectivity and activity are influenced by their oxidation states, the nature of oxygenated intermediates, and the binding energy of *O. Understanding these factors through combined experimental and theoretical approaches can lead to the development of safer and more selective catalysts for the CO2-ODH of light alkanes.

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct properties in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows a 58% selectivity for C3H6, with good stability, making it a promising catalyst for CO2-ODH. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is highly active for DRP, achieving 96% selectivity for CO. The intrinsic activity of these catalysts can be further clarified by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity. Unlike reactions with O2, CO2-ODH leads to a net reduction of CO2, as CO2 is consumed rather than produced. In situ XANES measurements reveal that Ni centers in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts are metallic, while Fe mainly exists as FeOx. For the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, 90% of the Ni sites are metallic, and Fe exists in various forms including Fe0, FeO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3. DFT calculations predict that Ni(111) favors CC scission, while FeOx/Ni(111) promotes CH cleavage. Understanding the dependence of alkene selectivity on the binding strength and configuration of intermediates can elucidate the active sites necessary for a promising CO2-ODH catalyst.

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were studied for their application in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 was found to be effective in CO2-ODH reactions, exhibiting 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 showed high activity in DRP reactions, with 96% selectivity for CO. The CO2-ODH reaction led to a net reduction of CO2, unlike oxidations with O2, which result in CO2 production due to over-oxidation. In terms of selectivity, Ni3Pt1 had a high y-intercept of 97%, suggesting it acts as a typical reforming catalyst, unlike Fe3Ni1 with a lower value of 22.2%. The synergistic effect between nickel and iron was evident in higher C3H6 yields compared to their monometallic counterparts. Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 was found to exist in oxidized forms under reaction conditions, indicated by FeOFe and FeO groups. Ni3Pt/CeO2 was characterized by Pt0, while Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 included Ni0. The binding configurations of intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) were similar, with stronger binding to the Fe3Ni(111) surface.
