          "CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10 Just as experimental and DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2+C2H6, a similar treatment can be done for CO2+C3H8 at 823K."
          "The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101)."
          "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
          "The catalysts' selectivity and activity can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity."
          "Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced."
          "In situ XANES measurements indicate that Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0."
          "The results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
          "According to thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions."

          The provided answers discuss the comparison of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. They highlight the catalysts' selectivity, stability, and activity, and how these are evaluated through experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies. The answers also touch upon the catalysts' synergistic effects, potential for environmentally benign catalysis, and implications for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.
