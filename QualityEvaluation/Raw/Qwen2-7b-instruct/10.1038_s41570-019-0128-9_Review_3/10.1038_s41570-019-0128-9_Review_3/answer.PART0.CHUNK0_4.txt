[1] "The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101)."
[2] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
[3] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."
[4] "Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced."
[5] "In the case of Ni3Pt1, the high value of the y-intercept of CO selectivity (97%) suggests that it is a typical reforming catalyst, while the same cannot be said for Fe3Ni1 (22.2%)."
[6] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."
[7] "By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102."
[8] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0."
[9] "These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
[10] "According to thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, consistent with the results obtained for the reactions of CO2 and C3H8."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were studied for their application in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 was found to be effective in CO2-ODH reactions, exhibiting 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 showed high activity in DRP reactions, with 96% selectivity for CO. The CO2-ODH reaction led to a net reduction of CO2, unlike oxidations with O2, which result in CO2 production due to over-oxidation. In terms of selectivity, Ni3Pt1 had a high y-intercept of 97%, suggesting it acts as a typical reforming catalyst, unlike Fe3Ni1 with a lower value of 22.2%. The synergistic effect between nickel and iron was evident in higher C3H6 yields compared to their monometallic counterparts. Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 was found to exist in oxidized forms under reaction conditions, indicated by FeOFe and FeO groups. Ni3Pt/CeO2 was characterized by Pt0, while Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 included Ni0. The binding configurations of intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) were similar, with stronger binding to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Lastly, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 did not exhibit coke formation or surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, which was consistent with its performance in CO2 and C3H8 reactions.

对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2这两种双金属催化剂进行了研究，用于丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应。Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中表现出色，C3H6选择性为58%，稳定性良好。另一方面，Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP反应中显示出高活性，CO的选择性达到96%。与使用O2的氧化反应相比，CO2-ODH反应导致CO2净减少，而氧化反应会导致CO2生产。从选择性来看，Ni3Pt1的y截距高达97%，表明其作为典型的重整催化剂作用，而Fe3Ni1的值仅为22.2%，不能说是典型重整催化剂。镍和铁之间的协同作用在更高的C3H6产率中得到体现，与它们的单金属对应物相比。Fe在Fe3Ni/CeO2中被发现以氧化形式存在，在反应条件下，由FeOFe和FeO组群独立证实。Ni3Pt/CeO2由Pt0组成，而Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2包含Ni0。Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面的中间体的结合配置相似，中间体在Fe3Ni(111)表面上结合得更强烈。最后，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在反应条件下没有出现结焦或表面金属聚集的现象，这与它在CO2和C3H8反应中的表现一致。
