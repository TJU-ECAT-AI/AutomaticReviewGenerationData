The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct properties in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows a 58% selectivity for C3H6, with good stability, making it a promising catalyst for CO2-ODH. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is highly active for DRP, achieving 96% selectivity for CO. The intrinsic activity of these catalysts can be further clarified by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity. Unlike reactions with O2, CO2-ODH leads to a net reduction of CO2, as CO2 is consumed rather than produced. In situ XANES measurements reveal that Ni centers in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts are metallic, while Fe mainly exists as FeOx. For the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, 90% of the Ni sites are metallic, and Fe exists in various forms including Fe0, FeO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3. DFT calculations predict that Ni(111) favors CC scission, while FeOx/Ni(111) promotes CH cleavage. Understanding the dependence of alkene selectivity on the binding strength and configuration of intermediates can elucidate the active sites necessary for a promising CO2-ODH catalyst.

在丙烷的二氧化碳氧化脱氢和重整反应中，二金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2表现出不同的特性。Fe3Ni1/CeO2显示出58％的C3H6选择性，且稳定性良好，使其成为二氧化碳氧化脱氢的有希望的催化剂。另一方面，Ni3Pt1/CeO2对于重整具有高度活性，实现了96％的CO选择性。通过将二氧化碳转换与CO选择性进行绘制，可以进一步阐明这些催化剂的内在活性。与使用O2的反应不同，CO2-ODH导致二氧化碳净减少，因为二氧化碳被消耗而不是产生。原位XANES测量表明FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中的Ni中心是金属的，而Fe主要以FeOx形式存在。对于Fe3Ni1催化剂，90％的Ni位点是金属的，并且Fe以Fe0，FeO，Fe3O4和Fe2O3的形式存在。DFT计算预测Ni(111)有利于CC断裂，而FeOx/Ni(111)促进CH裂解。理解中间体结合强度和配置对烯烃选择性的影响可以揭示形成有希望的CO2-ODH催化剂所需的活性位点的性质。
