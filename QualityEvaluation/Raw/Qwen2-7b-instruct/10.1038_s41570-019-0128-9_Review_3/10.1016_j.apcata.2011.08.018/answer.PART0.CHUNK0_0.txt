[1] "Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method."
[2] "Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively."
[3] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."
[4] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

In the study, a series of binary In2O3/MOx catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts had either a low (3 wt%) or high (10 wt%) loading of In2O3. The physico-chemical properties, including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3, were characterized. The results showed that a higher population of highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support was beneficial for propylene production, and the highest propylene yield was obtained with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. High dispersion of In2O3 and a balanced acidic/basic property, which facilitated synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, were crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

在研究中，制备了一系列由In2O3/MOx组成的二元催化剂，采用浸渍湿法。催化剂的负载量分别为低（3 wt%）和高（10 wt%）的In2O3。通过X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱、氢气温度程序还原、NH3和CO2温度程序脱附等方法对支持的In2O3的物理化学性质进行了表征。结果显示，支持体上高度分散的特定In2O3物种的更高浓度有利于丙烯生产，且最高丙烯产率是在高负载的In2O3/Al2O3催化剂中实现的。In2O3的高分散度和酸碱性平衡，以及促进脱氢和逆水煤气变换之间的协同作用，对于实现PDH反应中的高效催化性能至关重要。
