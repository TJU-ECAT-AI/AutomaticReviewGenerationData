Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method.
Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively.
It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3.
Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH.

The study investigates the effect of In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction, particularly in the presence of CO2. The catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method. The physico-chemical properties, such as surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties, were characterized through various techniques. It was found that a higher population of specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support is beneficial for propylene production. The maximum propylene yield was observed with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For achieving high catalytic performance, it is essential to have high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, which promote synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift.

该研究探讨了In2O3/MOx（M = Al，Zr，Si）催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的作用，特别是在二氧化碳存在的条件下。通过浸渍湿法准备催化剂。通过多种技术对催化剂的物理化学性质进行了表征，包括表面组成、氧化还原性和酸碱性质。发现支持物上的特定高度分散的In2O3物种的更高数量对于丙烯生产是有利的。在高负载的In2O3/Al2O3催化剂中实现了最大丙烯产率。为了实现PDH的高效催化性能，需要高In2O3分散和平衡的酸碱性质，这促进脱氢与逆水煤气变换之间的协同作用。
