Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method.
Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively.
It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3.
Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH.

The study investigated the support effect on In-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in the presence of CO2. The researchers prepared binary In2O3/MOx catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings through an incipient wetness impregnation method. The physico-chemical properties of the supported In2O3, including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties, were characterized using various techniques. The results showed that a higher population of specifically dispersed In2O3 species on the support material was beneficial for propylene production. The highest propylene yield was observed with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For achieving optimal catalytic performance in PDH, the study emphasized the importance of high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, which facilitate synergies between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions.

研究详细探讨了In基催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的支撑效应。研究人员通过浸渍湿法制备了具有低（3 wt%）和高（10 wt%）In2O3负载量的二元In2O3/MOx催化剂。通过多种技术对支持In2O3的物理化学性质进行了表征，包括表面组成、氧化还原性和酸碱性质。结果显示，在支撑材料上特定高度分散的In2O3物种的更高浓度有利于丙烯生成。在高负载的In2O3/Al2O3催化剂中观察到了最高的丙烯产率。为了实现PDH过程中的最佳催化性能，研究强调了高In2O3分散性和平衡酸碱性质的重要性，这些性质促进了脱氢和逆水煤气变换反应之间的协同作用。
