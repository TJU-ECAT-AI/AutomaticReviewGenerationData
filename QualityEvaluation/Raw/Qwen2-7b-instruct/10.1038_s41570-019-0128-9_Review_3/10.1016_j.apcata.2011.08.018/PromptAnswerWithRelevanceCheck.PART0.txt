[1] "Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method."
[2] "Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively."
[3] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."
[4] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

In the study, a series of binary In2O3/MOx catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts had either a low (3 wt%) or high (10 wt%) loading of In2O3. The physico-chemical properties, including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3, were characterized. The results showed that a higher population of highly dispersed In2O3 species on the support was beneficial for propylene production, and the highest propylene yield was obtained with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. High dispersion of In2O3 and a balanced acidic/basic property, which facilitated synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, were crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

The study investigates the impact of In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with various In2O3 loadings (3 wt% and 10 wt%) on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction in the presence of CO2. The catalysts were characterized for their physico-chemical properties, which include surface composition, redox behavior, and acidic/basic properties. It was found that a higher dispersion of specific In2O3 species on the support promotes propylene production, with the highest yield achieved using the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For optimal performance, the catalysts require high dispersion of In2O3 and balanced acidic/basic properties to facilitate a synergistic effect between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift.
