[1] "Two series of binary In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with low (3 wt%) and high (10 wt%) In2O3 loadings were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method."
[2] "Physico-chemical properties including surface composition, redox, and acidic/basic properties of the supported In2O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, NH3 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption, respectively."
[3] "It was demonstrated that a higher population of the specific highly dispersed In2O3 species on support is favorable for propylene production, and the maximum propylene yield was achieved with the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3."
[4] "Properties including high In2O3 dispersion and balanced acidic/basic properties, rendering synergism between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift, are essential for achieving high catalytic performance of PDH."

The study investigates the impact of In2O3/MOx (M = Al, Zr, Si) catalysts with various In2O3 loadings (3 wt% and 10 wt%) on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction in the presence of CO2. The catalysts were characterized for their physico-chemical properties, which include surface composition, redox behavior, and acidic/basic properties. It was found that a higher dispersion of specific In2O3 species on the support promotes propylene production, with the highest yield achieved using the high-loading In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. For optimal performance, the catalysts require high dispersion of In2O3 and balanced acidic/basic properties to facilitate a synergistic effect between dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift.

研究考察了不同In2O3负载（3 wt%和10 wt%）的In2O3/MOx（M=Al、Zr、Si）催化剂对含CO2的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的影响。对催化剂进行了物理化学性质表征，包括表面组成、氧化还原性和酸碱性。结果表明，支持物上特定In2O3物种的高分散度有利于丙烯生产，最高产率在使用高负载In2O3/Al2O3催化剂时实现。为了达到最佳性能，催化剂需要In2O3的高分散度和平衡的酸碱性来促进脱氢与逆水煤气变换的协同作用。
