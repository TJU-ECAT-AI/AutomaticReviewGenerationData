The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were studied for their effectiveness in oxidizing dehydrogenating (ODH) and dry reforming (DRP) propane reactions with carbon dioxide. Experimental outcomes revealed that the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst outperformed the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst in terms of productivity and selectivity for alkene creation. This was attributed to the synergistic effects of iron and nickel on the catalyst's surface, as evidenced by theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, exhibited superior stability under reaction conditions, making it more suitable for prolonged operation. Both catalysts showed promise for minimizing CO2 emissions and facilitating alkene production through the efficient utilization of renewable resources.

对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2双金属催化剂进行了研究，以评估它们在丙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢（ODH）和干重整（DRP）反应中的性能。实验结果表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在丙烯等烯烃产物的产率和选择性方面优于Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂。理论密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示了催化剂表面铁和镍的协同作用是催化剂性能提升的原因。另一方面，Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在反应条件下表现出更好的稳定性，使其更适合长期运行。这两种催化剂都显示出减少二氧化碳排放并利用可再生能源高效生产烯烃的潜力。
