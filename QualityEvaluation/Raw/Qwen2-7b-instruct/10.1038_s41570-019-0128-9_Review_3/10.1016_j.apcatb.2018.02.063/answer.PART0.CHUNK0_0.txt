The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst was found to have higher selectivity for alkene production than the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, exhibited superior stability under reaction conditions. Both catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and dry reforming of propane (DRP) reactions. The synergistic effects of the bimetallic components were critical in boosting the overall activity of the catalysts. Theoretical studies (Density Functional Theory, DFT) supported the proposed reaction mechanisms and provided valuable insights into the electronic structure of the catalysts.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在丙烷的CO2-氧化脱氢（ODH）和干重整反应中对烯烃生成的选择性更高，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂在反应条件下表现出更优的稳定性。两种催化剂在CO2-ODH和DRP反应中表现出卓越的性能。双金属组分之间的协同效应对于提高催化剂的整体活性至关重要。理论研究（密度泛函理论，DFT）支持了提出的反应机制，并为催化剂的电子结构提供了有价值的见解。
