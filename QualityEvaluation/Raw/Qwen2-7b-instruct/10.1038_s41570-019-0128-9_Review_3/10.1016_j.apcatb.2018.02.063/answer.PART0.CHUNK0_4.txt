The study compares the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 bimetallic catalysts in their performance for CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and dry reforming (DRP) reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates higher activity in the CO2-ODH reaction, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 shows better stability in the DRP process. The synergistic effects of these catalysts enhance their catalytic performance. Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer insights into the reaction mechanisms on the surfaces of these catalysts. These results indicate the potential of these bimetallic catalysts for efficient CO2 conversion to valuable alkenes in an environmentally friendly manner.
