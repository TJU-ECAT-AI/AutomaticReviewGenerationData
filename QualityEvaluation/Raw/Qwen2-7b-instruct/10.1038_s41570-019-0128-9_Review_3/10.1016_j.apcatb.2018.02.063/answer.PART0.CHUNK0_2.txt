[1] "In this work, we have synthesized two novel NiFe bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2, for CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and dry reforming of propane (DRP)."
[2] "The bimetallic catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms."
[3] "In the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, the catalysts showed high activity and selectivity towards alkenes, with the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrating better stability compared to the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 counterpart."
[4] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the reaction mechanisms and the synergistic effects of the bimetallic catalysts."
[5] "The results indicated that the bimetallic catalysts could effectively promote the activation of CO2 and the formation of alkene products through a series of intermediate steps."
[6] "Both experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the synergistic effects between Ni and Fe/Pt in the bimetallic catalysts played a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance."
[7] "The findings suggest that these bimetallic catalysts have great potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the production of alkenes from CO2 and propane, contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions."
