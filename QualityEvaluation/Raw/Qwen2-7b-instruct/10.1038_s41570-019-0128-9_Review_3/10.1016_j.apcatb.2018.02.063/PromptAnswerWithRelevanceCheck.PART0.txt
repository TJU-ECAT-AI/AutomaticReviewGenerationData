The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst was found to have higher selectivity for alkene production than the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, exhibited superior stability under reaction conditions. Both catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and dry reforming of propane (DRP) reactions. The synergistic effects of the bimetallic components were critical in boosting the overall activity of the catalysts. Theoretical studies (Density Functional Theory, DFT) supported the proposed reaction mechanisms and provided valuable insights into the electronic structure of the catalysts.

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 were studied for their effectiveness in oxidizing dehydrogenating (ODH) and dry reforming (DRP) propane reactions with carbon dioxide. Experimental outcomes revealed that the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst outperformed the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst in terms of productivity and selectivity for alkene creation. This was attributed to the synergistic effects of iron and nickel on the catalyst's surface, as evidenced by theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, on the other hand, exhibited superior stability under reaction conditions, making it more suitable for prolonged operation. Both catalysts showed promise for minimizing CO2 emissions and facilitating alkene production through the efficient utilization of renewable resources.
