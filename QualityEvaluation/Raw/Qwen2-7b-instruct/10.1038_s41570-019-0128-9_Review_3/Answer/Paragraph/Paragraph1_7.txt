        Comparative analysis of the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane reveals distinct performances, mechanisms, and characteristics. This analysis draws from the study published in reference \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\], which employs both experimental and theoretical (DFT) approaches to evaluate the catalysts' selectivity, stability, and activity.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is shown to be selective for propylene production through the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity towards CO in the DRP reaction. The experimental results highlight the synergistic effect that enhances the propylene yield of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst compared to its monometallic counterparts. The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP are determined to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, indicating the energy required for these reactions.

        The in-situ XANES measurements reveal that under reaction conditions, Ni3Pt/CeO2 consists of metallic Pt, whereas both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 contain metallic Ni. This indicates the metallic state of the catalysts during the reactions, which could influence their reactivity and selectivity.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on the surfaces of bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) offer insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of CH and CC bonds in propane. These calculations predict that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), whereas the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. This distinction in reaction pathways underscores the unique catalytic properties of each catalyst.

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 maintains stability under reaction conditions, with minimal mass loss. This suggests that the main deactivation pathway is not due to coking, indicating a high level of thermal stability for this catalyst.

        The insights gained from this comparative analysis emphasize the potential of bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in achieving environmentally benign catalysis for the production of alkenes from CO2 and propane. The synergistic effects and enhanced stability observed in these catalysts suggest their promising role in reducing CO2 emissions and contributing to global alkene production.

        Looking ahead, future research might explore the integration of these catalysts into larger-scale processes and investigate the impact of operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, and gas composition on their performance. Additionally, the discovery of novel synergies between metals and support materials could lead to the development of even more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2 utilization.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在丙烷CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的比较性分析揭示了这些催化剂在性能、机制和特性上的差异。这一分析基于参考文献\[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]中的实验和理论（DFT）方法对催化剂的选择性、稳定性和活性进行评估。

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2表现出通过CO2-ODHP途径选择性地生成丙烯的特性，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2则在DRP反应中显示出高CO选择性。实验结果表明，双金属Fe3Ni催化剂与单金属相比展现出协同效应，提高了丙烯的产率。CO2-ODHP和DRP的活化能分别被确定为115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1，这表明这两个反应所需的能量。

        在反应条件下，Ni3Pt/CeO2由金属Pt组成，而Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2均含有金属Ni。这表明催化剂在反应过程中的金属状态，可能影响其活性和选择性。

        执行在Fe3Ni(111)表面终止的金属体和Ni3Pt(111)表面终止的Pt的密度功能理论（DFT）计算提供了氧化裂解丙烷中的CH和CC键的潜在反应路径的见解。这些计算预测，Ni3Pt(111)表面优选CC键裂解路径，而Fe3Ni(111)表面则偏好CH键裂解路径。这种反应路径的区别凸显了每种催化剂的独特催化性质。

        热重分析和原位X射线衍射测量证实，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在反应条件下保持稳定性，仅损失不到原始质量的一半。这表明催化剂的主要失活途径不太可能是结焦，这说明这种催化剂具有很高的热稳定性。
