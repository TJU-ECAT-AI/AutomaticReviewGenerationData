Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been extensively studied through experimental and theoretical (DFT) approaches. The reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\] highlights that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are two prominent catalysts in this context, with distinct roles and properties.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2, a bimetallic system incorporating iron and nickel supported on ceria, demonstrates selective propylene production via the CO2-ODH pathway. This catalyst is noted for its superior activity and selectivity, as evidenced by higher propylene yields compared to its monometallic counterparts, Ni and Fe, when tested on propane. This suggests a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst, enhancing its performance in CO2-ODH reactions.

        On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2, featuring a combination of nickel and platinum on ceria support, is highly active for DRP with high selectivity towards carbon monoxide. The differences in propylene yields on a propane basis underscore the distinct catalytic activities and potential synergistic effects between these bimetallic catalysts.

        Thermodynamic studies reveal that the activation barriers for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts, respectively, are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1. These values indicate the energy required for the catalytic conversion processes, with lower barriers typically associated with faster reaction kinetics.

        Stability and deactivation pathways are also critical factors in evaluating catalyst performance. The TGA results for Fe3Ni1/CeO2 suggest minimal mass loss under reaction conditions, indicating low susceptibility to deactivation due to coking. This stability is crucial for maintaining efficient CO2 utilization and product yields over extended operation periods.

        The in situ XANES measurements provide insights into the local environment and coordination states of metals on the catalyst surfaces. For instance, Ni3Pt/CeO2 exhibits metallic platinum, while both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts feature metallic nickel, which influences their reactivity and selectivity patterns.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer deeper understanding of the reaction pathways involved in CO2 oxidation and hydrogenation processes. The calculations predict that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on Ni3Pt(111) surfaces, whereas the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface prefers the CH bond cleavage pathway. This distinction in reaction mechanisms contributes to the unique catalytic activities observed for each catalyst.

        Overall, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 reveals their potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the production of alkenes and reduction of CO2 emissions. These findings underscore the importance of bimetallic catalyst design in achieving efficient and selective conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals, contributing to sustainable global alkene production.

        在对二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODH）和脱氢反应（DRP）与丙烷反应的双金属催化剂性能、机制和特征进行的比较分析中，实验和理论（DFT）方法得到了广泛应用。根据\[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]的参考文献，Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2是两种在这一领域中表现突出的催化剂。

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2，一种铁镍复合物在铈基质上的双金属体系，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢路径下表现出选择性的丙烯生产特性。通过测试丙烷，该催化剂显示出与单金属Ni和Fe相比更高的丙烯产率，这表明了Fe3Ni复合催化剂的协同效应，增强了其在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的活性和选择性。

        相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2，由镍和铂组成的复合物在铈基质上，对于脱氢反应具有高度活性，并且对一氧化碳有高选择性。不同的是，丙烷基础下的丙烯产率差异反映了这两种双金属催化剂在催化活性和潜在协同作用方面的区别。

        热力学研究揭示了Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂上二氧化碳氧化和重组反应的活化能分别为115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1。较低的活化能通常与较快的反应动力学相关联，因此这些值对于评估催化剂性能至关重要。

        稳定性和失活途径也是评估催化剂性能的关键因素。Fe3Ni1/CeO2的热重分析结果表明，在反应条件下仅损失原质量的不到一半，这表明由于结焦导致的主要失活途径可能性不大。这种稳定性对于维持CO2利用效率和产品产率的长期操作至关重要。

        在位X射线吸收精细结构（XANES）测量提供了关于催化剂表面金属环境和配位状态的见解。例如，Ni3Pt/CeO2表现出金属铂，而Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂都包含金属镍，这些差异影响了它们的活性和选择性模式。

        密度泛函理论（DFT）计算为二氧化碳氧化和氢化过程涉及的反应途径提供了更深入的理解。计算预测，Ni3Pt(111)表面倾向于CC键裂解途径，而Fe3Ni(111)表面则偏好CH键裂解途径。这种反应机制的区别导致了每种催化剂的独特催化活性。

        总体而言，Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2的比较分析揭示了它们在环境友好催化作用、CO2减排以及全球烯烃生产方面的潜力。这些发现强调了双金属催化剂设计在实现高效和选择性CO2转化方面的关键作用，从而促进了可持续的全球烯烃生产。

        

        集成理解与未来展望：考虑到文件中讨论的先进成果和发现，我们有机会探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来的研究努力可能会集中在：

        - **扩展催化剂设计**：探索更多元化的双金属或多金属组合，以优化催化性能并提高选择性。
        - **增强催化剂稳定性**：开发新型载体材料或通过改变支持物的性质来提高催化剂的热稳定性和机械稳定性，减少失活风险。
        - **反应机制的深入研究**：利用先进的表征技术，如原位X射线衍射（XRD）、同步辐射吸收光谱（SAXS）等，进一步探究催化剂表面反应中间体的吸附和转化机制，以指导催化剂设计和优化。

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\], \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\], and \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. 

        Comparative analysis of the performance, mechanisms, and characteristics of the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has revealed several key insights. These catalysts demonstrate distinct selectivities and activities, which are crucial for the production of alkenes from CO2. The selectivity and activity can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, highlighting the efficiency of each catalyst in converting CO2 to desired products.

        Unlike conventional oxidations with oxygen, which often result in the over-oxidation of substrates leading to CO2 production, the CO2-ODH reaction leads to a net reduction of CO2, as the reactant CO2 is consumed rather than generated. This unique feature makes these catalysts particularly interesting for applications in CO2 emissions reduction and alkene production.

        In situ XANES measurements have shown that Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 contain metallic Ni under reaction conditions. This indicates that the presence of both precious and non-precious metals in the bimetallic systems contributes to their enhanced catalytic properties.

        The results also suggest that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surfaces are similar, with all intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. This characteristic is crucial for understanding the reaction mechanisms and optimizing the catalytic process.

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, indicating that this catalyst maintains its stability over time. This is a significant advantage in industrial applications, as it reduces the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided valuable insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of CH and CC bonds in propane, revealing that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. These findings underscore the importance of surface chemistry in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.

        In terms of performance, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows a synergistic effect in CO2-ODH, enhancing propylene yield compared to monometallic catalysts. Similarly, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates high selectivity towards CO in the DRP, again outperforming single metal catalysts. The activation barriers for CO2-ODH and DRP are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, indicating that these catalysts can efficiently drive these reactions at moderate temperatures.

        The Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting that deactivation is unlikely due to coking. This stability is a critical factor for maintaining high efficiency and productivity in industrial processes.

        Overall, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 highlights their potential for environmentally benign catalysis, offering promising avenues for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The synergistic effects, stability, and high selectivity of these bimetallic catalysts make them attractive candidates for future industrial applications.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:

        1. **Enhancing Selectivity and Activity**: Investigate the effects of different support materials, metal ratios, and surface modifications on the selectivity and activity of these catalysts. This could lead to the development of even more efficient catalysts for CO2 utilization.

        2. **Exploring Novel Reaction Mechanisms**: Further theoretical studies using advanced computational methods could help uncover novel reaction pathways that could significantly improve the efficiency of CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

        3. **Improving Stability and Durability**: Develop strategies to enhance the stability and durability of these catalysts under harsh industrial conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures, or in the presence of corrosive species.

        4. **Scaling Up for Industrial Applications**: Address the challenges associated with scaling up these catalysts for industrial use, including cost-effectiveness, scalability, and compatibility with existing processes.

        5. **Expanding Catalytic Scope**: Explore the applicability of these catalysts in other CO2-based reactions, such as CO2 hydrogenation to methanol or other hydrocarbons, to broaden their utility in the chemical industry.

        6. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment to evaluate the sustainability and ecological footprint of these catalytic processes, ensuring that they contribute positively to the goal of reducing CO2 emissions and promoting a circular economy.

        By pursuing these avenues, researchers can leverage the insights gained from the current studies to push the boundaries of catalysis and contribute to sustainable chemical processes that address pressing environmental challenges.
