The comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been extensively studied, providing insights into their unique performance, mechanisms, and characteristics. This review delves into the experimental and theoretical (DFT) aspects, focusing on their selectivity, stability, and synergistic effects.

        The detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\] highlights the distinct roles of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, respectively. The synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\] further elucidates the underlying mechanisms and performance metrics of these catalysts.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is noted for its promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity towards CO in DRP. The synergistic effect between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts increases propylene yield compared to their respective monometal counterparts. This synergy is substantiated by the higher propylene yield observed on Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) compared to Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%).

        The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating the energetic requirements for these reactions. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that the Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting that deactivation is unlikely due to coking.

        In situ XANES measurements indicate that Ni3Pt/CeO2 consists of metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include metallic Ni. This suggests that the metallic state of Ni in these catalysts plays a crucial role in their reactivity.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide deeper insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of propane bonds. It is found that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. This prediction aligns with the observed selectivities of the catalysts in the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

        These findings underscore the potential of bimetallic catalysts in achieving environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The insights gathered from experimental and theoretical studies offer a foundation for future research endeavors aimed at exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies.

        Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to delve into the integration of these catalysts with other technologies to enhance their performance and efficiency. Potential areas for future exploration might include the development of catalyst supports with enhanced properties, the optimization of operating conditions for better selectivity and activity, and the investigation of catalyst recycling strategies to improve sustainability.

        In conclusion, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane showcases the promise of bimetallic catalysts in sustainable chemical synthesis. The experimental and theoretical insights presented here pave the way for future advancements in catalyst design and application, contributing to the global efforts in reducing CO2 emissions and promoting the production of valuable alkenes.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on integrating bimetallic catalysts with renewable energy sources to achieve a circular economy, optimizing the reaction conditions for enhanced efficiency, and developing advanced catalyst supports that can withstand harsh environments without compromising performance. Additionally, the exploration of catalyst recycling strategies could significantly reduce the environmental footprint associated with their use, making these catalysts even more sustainable options for industrial applications.

Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been extensively studied, as evidenced by the references \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\] and \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. These studies have identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of propane, respectively. The catalysts' selectivity and activity are assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, highlighting their efficiency in these reactions.

        The CO2-ODH reaction, unlike oxidations with O2, leads to a net reduction of CO2 as CO2 is consumed rather than produced. This unique characteristic is attributed to the selective nature of these catalysts in favoring the reduction of CO2 to alkenes. The in situ XANES measurements reveal distinct binding configurations on the surfaces of Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111), with all intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Moreover, both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions, indicating their stability and potential for long-term use.

        The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are reported to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, suggesting that Fe3Ni may offer a slight advantage in energy efficiency. Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, indicating its robust stability.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of propane, predicting that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms and suggest that the choice of catalyst can significantly influence the product distribution.

        The synergistic effect between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt is evident in the increased propylene yield observed over Fe3Ni, compared to monometals. This highlights the importance of bimetallic systems in enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity for alkene production.

        In conclusion, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrate promising performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, offering a sustainable approach to alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The synergistic effects, stability, and unique reactivity profiles of these catalysts underscore their potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the global alkene industry.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of catalyst design to achieve higher selectivity and activity, the development of more efficient reaction conditions, and the integration of these technologies into industrial-scale processes. Additionally, exploring the scalability of these catalysts and their performance under real-world conditions could provide valuable insights into their practical applicability. The synergistic effects observed between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt suggest that there is potential for developing hybrid systems that combine the strengths of multiple bimetallic catalysts, further enhancing their performance and sustainability in the production of alkenes and the reduction of CO2 emissions.
