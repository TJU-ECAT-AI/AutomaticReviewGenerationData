The comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been extensively studied, providing insights into their unique performance, mechanisms, and characteristics. This review delves into the experimental and theoretical (DFT) aspects, focusing on their selectivity, stability, and synergistic effects.

        The detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\] highlights the distinct roles of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, respectively. The synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\] further elucidates the underlying mechanisms and performance metrics of these catalysts.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is noted for its promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity towards CO in DRP. The synergistic effect between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts increases propylene yield compared to their respective monometal counterparts. This synergy is substantiated by the higher propylene yield observed on Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) compared to Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%).

        The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating the energetic requirements for these reactions. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that the Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting that deactivation is unlikely due to coking.

        In situ XANES measurements indicate that Ni3Pt/CeO2 consists of metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include metallic Ni. This suggests that the metallic state of Ni in these catalysts plays a crucial role in their reactivity.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide deeper insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of propane bonds. It is found that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. This prediction aligns with the observed selectivities of the catalysts in the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

        These findings underscore the potential of bimetallic catalysts in achieving environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The insights gathered from experimental and theoretical studies offer a foundation for future research endeavors aimed at exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies.

        Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to delve into the integration of these catalysts with other technologies to enhance their performance and efficiency. Potential areas for future exploration might include the development of catalyst supports with enhanced properties, the optimization of operating conditions for better selectivity and activity, and the investigation of catalyst recycling strategies to improve sustainability.

        In conclusion, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane showcases the promise of bimetallic catalysts in sustainable chemical synthesis. The experimental and theoretical insights presented here pave the way for future advancements in catalyst design and application, contributing to the global efforts in reducing CO2 emissions and promoting the production of valuable alkenes.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on integrating bimetallic catalysts with renewable energy sources to achieve a circular economy, optimizing the reaction conditions for enhanced efficiency, and developing advanced catalyst supports that can withstand harsh environments without compromising performance. Additionally, the exploration of catalyst recycling strategies could significantly reduce the environmental footprint associated with their use, making these catalysts even more sustainable options for industrial applications.

Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane: An experimental and theoretical study focusing on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\] and \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\].

        The comparative study underscores the distinct roles of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Both catalysts demonstrate remarkable selectivity and activity in their respective pathways, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 being active for DRP. A synergistic effect emerges when comparing Fe3Ni1/CeO2 to Ni and Fe monometals, indicating enhanced propylene yield attributed to the bimetallic structure.

        The experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies reveal that the activation barriers for CO2-ODH and DRP are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt. These values suggest that the Fe3Ni system exhibits lower activation energy, making it more efficient in the CO2-ODH process. Moreover, the Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, which could be attributed to its resistance against coking under reaction conditions, a critical factor for long-term operation.

        The in situ XANES measurements provide insights into the surface chemistry of these catalysts, highlighting the metallic states of Ni and Pt in Ni3Pt/CeO2 and Fe3Ni/CeO2, respectively. This information is crucial for understanding the catalytic activity and selectivity of these materials.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms, revealing that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. This distinction in reaction mechanisms underscores the importance of surface structure in determining the efficiency of CO2 conversion and alkene production.

        In summary, the study provides a comprehensive evaluation of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Their unique properties, including selectivity, stability, and activity, make them attractive candidates for enhancing global alkene production and reducing CO2 emissions.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the composition and support materials for these catalysts to enhance their performance further. The integration of machine learning algorithms to predict catalyst behavior under various conditions could lead to more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes. Additionally, exploring the synergistic effects of incorporating third metals or modifying the support material could unlock new avenues for improving the selectivity and stability of these catalysts. The potential for scaling up these catalysts for industrial applications, ensuring environmental benignity, and contributing to global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction remains a significant area of interest for researchers.

        The future of bimetallic catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions holds promise for sustainable chemical synthesis and environmental protection, paving the way for innovative solutions to mitigate climate change and promote a circular economy.
