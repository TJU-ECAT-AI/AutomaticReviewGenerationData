Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\], \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\], and others. Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 reveals their distinct performances, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are bimetallic catalysts composed of a non-precious metal (Fe, Co, or Ni) combined with a precious metal (Pt or Pd) supported on CeO2. These catalysts have been studied for their selectivity, stability, and activity in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, with a particular focus on their ability to convert propane into alkenes. Experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies highlight the catalysts' selectivity and activity by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity.

        Unlike oxidations with O2, which lead to CO2 production due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 as CO2 is consumed instead of being produced. In situ XANES measurements confirm the metallic state of Pt and Ni in Ni3Pt/CeO2 and Fe3Ni/CeO2, respectively, under reaction conditions. The binding configurations of intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, with stronger binding to the Fe3Ni(111) surface.

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements show that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, indicating its stability. The apparent activation energies for CO2-ODH and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, revealing the energy barriers for these reactions. 

        The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect, increasing propylene yield compared to monometals. The DFT calculations predict that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway.

        Insights gained from this comparative analysis suggest that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 offer potential for environmentally benign catalysis in global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The catalysts' synergistic effects, selectivity, stability, and lower activation barriers make them promising candidates for CO2 utilization and alkene production.

        Looking ahead, the study opens avenues for future research focusing on the optimization of catalyst design, exploration of novel bimetallic compositions, and the integration of advanced computational methods to enhance catalyst performance. Emerging fields such as in-situ monitoring, real-time process control, and the development of scalable synthesis methods for these catalysts could significantly impact the efficiency and environmental sustainability of CO2 utilization technologies.

The comparative analysis of the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in the context of CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, as detailed in the referenced studies \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\] and \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\], illuminates their distinct performances, mechanisms, and characteristics. The synthesis of these catalysts involves a blend of a precious metal (Pt or Pd) with a non-precious metal (Fe, Co, or Ni), supported on CeO2, showcasing a versatile approach to enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity \[101\].

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 emerged as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of propane, respectively, as per the steady-state flow reactions \[102\]. These catalysts exhibit high selectivity and activity, which can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity. Unlike traditional oxidation reactions with oxygen leading to CO2 production due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2, as CO2 is consumed rather than produced \[101\].

        In situ XANES measurements revealed that the Ni3Pt catalyst comprises metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions. The binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surfaces are similar, with all intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface \[101\].

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements indicated that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, highlighting its stability \[101\]. The apparent activation energies for the CO2-ODH reaction over Fe3Ni were found to be 115 kJ mol−1, while those for DRP over Ni3Pt were 119 kJ mol−1 \[102\].

        The DFT calculations on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces further elucidated the potential reaction pathways, revealing that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), whereas bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway \[102\].

        A notable synergy between the Fe3Ni catalysts increases the propylene yield compared to monometals, underscoring the benefits of bimetallic systems in enhancing catalytic performance \[102\]. The Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, indicating a low risk of deactivation due to coking \[102\].

        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the referenced studies, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in the realm of environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Future research endeavors might focus on refining catalyst design, optimizing reaction conditions, and expanding the scope of applications to encompass a broader range of feedstocks and products.
