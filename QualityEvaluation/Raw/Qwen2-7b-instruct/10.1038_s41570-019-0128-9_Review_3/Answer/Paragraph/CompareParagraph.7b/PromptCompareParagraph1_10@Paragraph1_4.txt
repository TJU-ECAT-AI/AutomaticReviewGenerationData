In an extensive comparative analysis, researchers have delved into the performance, mechanisms, and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts in the carbon dioxide oxygenate to hydrocarbons (CO2-ODH) and decarboxylation reactions of propane (DRP), specifically examining the efficacy of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts. This experimental and theoretical investigation aimed to unravel the underlying factors influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity of these materials under various reaction conditions. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable efficiency in CO2-ODH reactions, showcasing a superior ability to convert CO2 into valuable hydrocarbons due to the synergistic effect between iron and nickel, which facilitates efficient CO2 activation and hydrogenation. Meanwhile, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 system was found to excel in DRP reactions, effectively converting propane into higher hydrocarbons through its enhanced capability to break chemical bonds within propane molecules, thanks to the synergistic interaction between nickel and platinum.

Theoretical studies further elucidated the electronic structure and surface chemistry of these catalysts, providing insights into their active sites and reaction pathways. It was observed that the bimetallic nature of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 enabled a more stable and active surface for both CO2-ODH and DRP processes, compared to their monometallic counterparts. This stability is crucial for industrial applications, as it ensures consistent performance over extended periods, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

Moreover, the analysis revealed that the addition of ceria (CeO2) as a support material plays a pivotal role in enhancing the thermal and mechanical stability of these catalysts, as well as improving their oxygen storage capacity, which is essential for efficient CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. The ceria also acts as a promoter, facilitating the redox reactions necessary for these catalytic transformations.

In conclusion, the comparative study of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions highlights their distinct advantages and unique mechanisms of action. These findings contribute significantly to the development of sustainable and efficient methods for carbon capture and utilization, offering promising avenues for the chemical industry to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\], \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\], and \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\]. 

        Comparative analysis of the performance, mechanisms, and characteristics of the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has revealed several key insights. These catalysts demonstrate distinct selectivities and activities, which are crucial for the production of alkenes from CO2. The selectivity and activity can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, highlighting the efficiency of each catalyst in converting CO2 to desired products.

        Unlike conventional oxidations with oxygen, which often result in the over-oxidation of substrates leading to CO2 production, the CO2-ODH reaction leads to a net reduction of CO2, as the reactant CO2 is consumed rather than generated. This unique feature makes these catalysts particularly interesting for applications in CO2 emissions reduction and alkene production.

        In situ XANES measurements have shown that Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 contain metallic Ni under reaction conditions. This indicates that the presence of both precious and non-precious metals in the bimetallic systems contributes to their enhanced catalytic properties.

        The results also suggest that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surfaces are similar, with all intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. This characteristic is crucial for understanding the reaction mechanisms and optimizing the catalytic process.

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, indicating that this catalyst maintains its stability over time. This is a significant advantage in industrial applications, as it reduces the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided valuable insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of CH and CC bonds in propane, revealing that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. These findings underscore the importance of surface chemistry in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.

        In terms of performance, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows a synergistic effect in CO2-ODH, enhancing propylene yield compared to monometallic catalysts. Similarly, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates high selectivity towards CO in the DRP, again outperforming single metal catalysts. The activation barriers for CO2-ODH and DRP are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, indicating that these catalysts can efficiently drive these reactions at moderate temperatures.

        The Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting that deactivation is unlikely due to coking. This stability is a critical factor for maintaining high efficiency and productivity in industrial processes.

        Overall, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 highlights their potential for environmentally benign catalysis, offering promising avenues for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The synergistic effects, stability, and high selectivity of these bimetallic catalysts make them attractive candidates for future industrial applications.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:

        1. **Enhancing Selectivity and Activity**: Investigate the effects of different support materials, metal ratios, and surface modifications on the selectivity and activity of these catalysts. This could lead to the development of even more efficient catalysts for CO2 utilization.

        2. **Exploring Novel Reaction Mechanisms**: Further theoretical studies using advanced computational methods could help uncover novel reaction pathways that could significantly improve the efficiency of CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

        3. **Improving Stability and Durability**: Develop strategies to enhance the stability and durability of these catalysts under harsh industrial conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures, or in the presence of corrosive species.

        4. **Scaling Up for Industrial Applications**: Address the challenges associated with scaling up these catalysts for industrial use, including cost-effectiveness, scalability, and compatibility with existing processes.

        5. **Expanding Catalytic Scope**: Explore the applicability of these catalysts in other CO2-based reactions, such as CO2 hydrogenation to methanol or other hydrocarbons, to broaden their utility in the chemical industry.

        6. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment to evaluate the sustainability and ecological footprint of these catalytic processes, ensuring that they contribute positively to the goal of reducing CO2 emissions and promoting a circular economy.

        By pursuing these avenues, researchers can leverage the insights gained from the current studies to push the boundaries of catalysis and contribute to sustainable chemical processes that address pressing environmental challenges.
