In an extensive comparative analysis, researchers have delved into the performance, mechanisms, and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts in the carbon dioxide oxygenate to hydrocarbons (CO2-ODH) and decarboxylation reactions of propane (DRP), specifically examining the efficacy of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts. This experimental and theoretical investigation aimed to unravel the underlying factors influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity of these materials under various reaction conditions. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable efficiency in CO2-ODH reactions, showcasing a superior ability to convert CO2 into valuable hydrocarbons due to the synergistic effect between iron and nickel, which facilitates efficient CO2 activation and hydrogenation. Meanwhile, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 system was found to excel in DRP reactions, effectively converting propane into higher hydrocarbons through its enhanced capability to break chemical bonds within propane molecules, thanks to the synergistic interaction between nickel and platinum.

Theoretical studies further elucidated the electronic structure and surface chemistry of these catalysts, providing insights into their active sites and reaction pathways. It was observed that the bimetallic nature of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 enabled a more stable and active surface for both CO2-ODH and DRP processes, compared to their monometallic counterparts. This stability is crucial for industrial applications, as it ensures consistent performance over extended periods, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

Moreover, the analysis revealed that the addition of ceria (CeO2) as a support material plays a pivotal role in enhancing the thermal and mechanical stability of these catalysts, as well as improving their oxygen storage capacity, which is essential for efficient CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. The ceria also acts as a promoter, facilitating the redox reactions necessary for these catalytic transformations.

In conclusion, the comparative study of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions highlights their distinct advantages and unique mechanisms of action. These findings contribute significantly to the development of sustainable and efficient methods for carbon capture and utilization, offering promising avenues for the chemical industry to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.

Comparative analysis of the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane reveals distinct performances, mechanisms, and characteristics. This analysis draws from the study published in reference \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\], which employs both experimental and theoretical (DFT) approaches to evaluate the catalysts' selectivity, stability, and activity.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is shown to be selective for propylene production through the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity towards CO in the DRP reaction. The experimental results highlight the synergistic effect that enhances the propylene yield of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst compared to its monometallic counterparts. The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP are determined to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, indicating the energy required for these reactions.

        The in-situ XANES measurements reveal that under reaction conditions, Ni3Pt/CeO2 consists of metallic Pt, whereas both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 contain metallic Ni. This indicates the metallic state of the catalysts during the reactions, which could influence their reactivity and selectivity.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on the surfaces of bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) offer insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of CH and CC bonds in propane. These calculations predict that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), whereas the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. This distinction in reaction pathways underscores the unique catalytic properties of each catalyst.

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 maintains stability under reaction conditions, with minimal mass loss. This suggests that the main deactivation pathway is not due to coking, indicating a high level of thermal stability for this catalyst.

        The insights gained from this comparative analysis emphasize the potential of bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in achieving environmentally benign catalysis for the production of alkenes from CO2 and propane. The synergistic effects and enhanced stability observed in these catalysts suggest their promising role in reducing CO2 emissions and contributing to global alkene production.

        Looking ahead, future research might explore the integration of these catalysts into larger-scale processes and investigate the impact of operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, and gas composition on their performance. Additionally, the discovery of novel synergies between metals and support materials could lead to the development of even more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2 utilization.

        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:
        - Expanding the scope of metal combinations to include other elements that could enhance catalytic properties or broaden the range of feedstocks.
        - Developing new methods for in-situ characterization that can provide real-time information about catalyst activity and stability.
        - Designing hierarchical structures or nanostructured catalysts that can improve the efficiency of CO2 utilization and alkene production.
        - Investigating the role of reaction mechanisms and pathways in the context of industrial-scale applications to optimize process conditions and enhance economic viability.
        - Enhancing the environmental compatibility of these catalysts through the use of renewable materials and the development of post-catalytic treatment technologies for waste minimization.
        - Exploring the potential of bimetallic catalysts in combination with other technologies, such as electrolysis or bioconversion, to create integrated systems for CO2 capture, utilization, and storage.
