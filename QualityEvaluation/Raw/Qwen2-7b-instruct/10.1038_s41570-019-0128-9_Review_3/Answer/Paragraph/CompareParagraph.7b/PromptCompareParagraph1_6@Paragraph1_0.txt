The comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been extensively studied, providing insights into their unique performance, mechanisms, and characteristics. This review delves into the experimental and theoretical (DFT) aspects, focusing on their selectivity, stability, and synergistic effects.

        The detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\] highlights the distinct roles of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, respectively. The synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\] further elucidates the underlying mechanisms and performance metrics of these catalysts.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is noted for its promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity towards CO in DRP. The synergistic effect between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts increases propylene yield compared to their respective monometal counterparts. This synergy is substantiated by the higher propylene yield observed on Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) compared to Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%).

        The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating the energetic requirements for these reactions. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that the Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting that deactivation is unlikely due to coking.

        In situ XANES measurements indicate that Ni3Pt/CeO2 consists of metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include metallic Ni. This suggests that the metallic state of Ni in these catalysts plays a crucial role in their reactivity.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide deeper insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of propane bonds. It is found that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. This prediction aligns with the observed selectivities of the catalysts in the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

        These findings underscore the potential of bimetallic catalysts in achieving environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The insights gathered from experimental and theoretical studies offer a foundation for future research endeavors aimed at exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies.

        Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to delve into the integration of these catalysts with other technologies to enhance their performance and efficiency. Potential areas for future exploration might include the development of catalyst supports with enhanced properties, the optimization of operating conditions for better selectivity and activity, and the investigation of catalyst recycling strategies to improve sustainability.

        In conclusion, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane showcases the promise of bimetallic catalysts in sustainable chemical synthesis. The experimental and theoretical insights presented here pave the way for future advancements in catalyst design and application, contributing to the global efforts in reducing CO2 emissions and promoting the production of valuable alkenes.

        

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on integrating bimetallic catalysts with renewable energy sources to achieve a circular economy, optimizing the reaction conditions for enhanced efficiency, and developing advanced catalyst supports that can withstand harsh environments without compromising performance. Additionally, the exploration of catalyst recycling strategies could significantly reduce the environmental footprint associated with their use, making these catalysts even more sustainable options for industrial applications.

The comparative analysis of the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in the context of CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, as detailed in the referenced studies \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3\] and \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\], illuminates their distinct performances, mechanisms, and characteristics. The synthesis of these catalysts involves a blend of a precious metal (Pt or Pd) with a non-precious metal (Fe, Co, or Ni), supported on CeO2, showcasing a versatile approach to enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity \[101\].

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 emerged as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of propane, respectively, as per the steady-state flow reactions \[102\]. These catalysts exhibit high selectivity and activity, which can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity. Unlike traditional oxidation reactions with oxygen leading to CO2 production due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2, as CO2 is consumed rather than produced \[101\].

        In situ XANES measurements revealed that the Ni3Pt catalyst comprises metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions. The binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surfaces are similar, with all intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface \[101\].

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements indicated that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, highlighting its stability \[101\]. The apparent activation energies for the CO2-ODH reaction over Fe3Ni were found to be 115 kJ mol−1, while those for DRP over Ni3Pt were 119 kJ mol−1 \[102\].

        The DFT calculations on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces further elucidated the potential reaction pathways, revealing that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), whereas bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway \[102\].

        A notable synergy between the Fe3Ni catalysts increases the propylene yield compared to monometals, underscoring the benefits of bimetallic systems in enhancing catalytic performance \[102\]. The Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, indicating a low risk of deactivation due to coking \[102\].

        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the referenced studies, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in the realm of environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Future research endeavors might focus on refining catalyst design, optimizing reaction conditions, and expanding the scope of applications to encompass a broader range of feedstocks and products.
