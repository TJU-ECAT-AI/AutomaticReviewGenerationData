This characteristic is crucial for understanding the reaction mechanisms and optimizing the catalytic process.

        Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, indicating that this catalyst maintains its stability over time. This is a significant advantage in industrial applications, as it reduces the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

These findings underscore the importance of surface chemistry in determining the efficiency of the catalytic reactions.

        In terms of performance, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows a synergistic effect in CO2-ODH, enhancing propylene yield compared to monometallic catalysts. Similarly, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates high selectivity towards CO in the DRP, again outperforming single metal catalysts. The activation barriers for CO2-ODH and DRP are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, indicating that these catalysts can efficiently drive these reactions at moderate temperatures.

        The Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting that deactivation is unlikely due to coking. This stability is a critical factor for maintaining high efficiency and productivity in industrial processes.

        Overall, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 highlights their potential for environmentally benign catalysis, offering promising avenues for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

This review delves into the experimental and theoretical (DFT) aspects, focusing on their selectivity, stability, and synergistic effects.

        The detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\] highlights the distinct roles of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions, respectively. The synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\] further elucidates the underlying mechanisms and performance metrics of these catalysts.

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is noted for its promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity towards CO in DRP. The synergistic effect between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts increases propylene yield compared to their respective monometal counterparts. This synergy is substantiated by the higher propylene yield observed on Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) compared to Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%).

        The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating the energetic requirements for these reactions. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that the Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting that deactivation is unlikely due to coking.

        In situ XANES measurements indicate that Ni3Pt/CeO2 consists of metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include metallic Ni. This suggests that the metallic state of Ni in these catalysts plays a crucial role in their reactivity.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide deeper insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of propane bonds. It is found that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. This prediction aligns with the observed selectivities of the catalysts in the CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

        These findings underscore the potential of bimetallic catalysts in achieving environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been extensively studied, as evidenced by the references \[10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3\] and \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\]. These studies have identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of propane, respectively. The catalysts' selectivity and activity are assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, highlighting their efficiency in these reactions.

        The CO2-ODH reaction, unlike oxidations with O2, leads to a net reduction of CO2 as CO2 is consumed rather than produced. This unique characteristic is attributed to the selective nature of these catalysts in favoring the reduction of CO2 to alkenes. The in situ XANES measurements reveal distinct binding configurations on the surfaces of Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111), with all intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Moreover, both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions, indicating their stability and potential for long-term use.

        The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are reported to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, suggesting that Fe3Ni may offer a slight advantage in energy efficiency. Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, indicating its robust stability.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative cleavage of propane, predicting that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms and suggest that the choice of catalyst can significantly influence the product distribution.

        The synergistic effect between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt is evident in the increased propylene yield observed over Fe3Ni, compared to monometals. This highlights the importance of bimetallic systems in enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity for alkene production.
