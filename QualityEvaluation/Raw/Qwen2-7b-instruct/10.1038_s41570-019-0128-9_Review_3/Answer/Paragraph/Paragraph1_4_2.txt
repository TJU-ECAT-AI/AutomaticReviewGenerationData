        Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been extensively explored through experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies. The examination of catalysts includes bimetallic systems comprised of precious metals (Pt or Pd) and non-precious metals (Fe, Co, or Ni), as well as combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2. These studies have identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of propane, respectively, highlighting their distinct selectivity, stability, and activity.

        The catalysts' selectivity and activity are assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, revealing the unique efficiency of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in their respective reactions. Unlike traditional oxidations with O2, which result in the over-production of CO2, the CO2-ODH reaction leads to a net reduction of CO2, as CO2 is consumed rather than produced. Insights into the catalysts' behavior during reactions come from in situ XANES measurements, which indicate that Ni3Pt/CeO2 features metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 contain metallic Ni.

        DFT calculations provide additional understanding of the reaction pathways, showing that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, with all intermediates binding more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 maintains stability under reaction conditions, with only a minor loss of its original mass, suggesting that coking is not the primary deactivation pathway.

        The synergy between Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts, demonstrated through increased propylene yields on a C3H8 basis compared to monometals, underscores the potential for environmentally benign catalysis in global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The activation barriers for CO2-ODH and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating the energy required for these transformations.

        Future research could focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies based on the advancements and findings discussed. For instance, there is an opportunity to delve deeper into the synergistic effects of bimetallic catalysts and their role in reducing CO2 emissions while producing valuable alkenes. Additionally, the potential for improving catalyst stability and enhancing the selectivity towards desired products remains an area of interest.

        In conclusion, the comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane showcases the importance of bimetallic systems in achieving high selectivity, stability, and activity. The insights gained from experimental and theoretical studies pave the way for further advancements in environmentally friendly catalysis, contributing to global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction efforts.

        对于CO2-ODH和DRP反应中丙烷的双金属催化剂（Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2）的性能、机制和特性进行了全面的比较分析。研究了由贵金属（Pt或Pd）和非贵金属（Fe、Co或Ni）组成的双金属系统以及非贵金属组合，所有这些都支持在CeO2上。结果表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2分别作为CO2-ODH和DRP的有希望的催化剂，突出了它们在各自反应中的选择性和稳定性。

        通过绘制CO2转化率与CO选择性之间的图，评估了催化剂的选择性和活性，揭示了Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在各自反应中的独特效率。与使用O2的传统氧化反应不同，导致过量CO2的产生，CO2-ODH反应导致CO2的净减少，因为CO2被消耗而不是产生。在反应条件下，对Ni3Pt/CeO2进行的原位XANES测量表明其包含金属态Pt，而Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2都包含金属态Ni。

        DFT计算提供了对反应途径的进一步了解，显示了Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-终止Ni3Pt(111)表面上所有中间体的结合配置相似，所有中间体均更强烈地结合到Fe3Ni(111)表面上。热重分析和原位XRD测量证实，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在反应条件下保持稳定，仅损失其原始质量的一小部分，表明焦炭化不是主要的失活途径。

        Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂之间的协同作用，通过丙烷基的丙烯产量比单金属显著增加来展示，强调了环境友好催化在全球烯烃生产和CO2排放减少方面的潜力。CO2-ODH和DRP在Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt上的激活壁垒分别为115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1，表明这些转换所需的能量。

        未来研究可以专注于探索新兴领域和创新方法，基于讨论的进展和发现。例如，有可能深入研究双金属催化剂的协同作用及其在减少CO2排放的同时生产有价值烯烃的作用。此外，提高催化剂稳定性并增强对所需产品的选择性的潜力仍然是一个研究兴趣的领域。

        总之，对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2作为CO2-ODH和DRP反应中丙烷催化剂的比较分析，展示了双金属系统在实现高选择性、稳定性和活性方面的重要性。实验和理论研究获取的见解为更环保的催化技术的发展铺平了道路，有助于全球烯烃生产和CO2排放减少的努力。
