        The comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane has been thoroughly investigated through both experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies. These catalysts have been synthesized with a focus on bimetallic systems containing a precious metal (Pt or Pd) combined with a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), along with combinations of non-precious metals supported on CeO2. The study highlights the unique performance of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2, with the former demonstrating superior selectivity towards propylene production via CO2-ODHP, and the latter being highly active for DRP with a notable selectivity towards CO.

        The evaluation of these catalysts' selectivity and activity involves assessing CO2 conversion against CO selectivity, offering insights into their efficiency in converting CO2 into desired products. Unlike traditional oxidations with O2 that result in CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction leads to a net reduction of CO2, as CO2 is consumed rather than produced. The in situ XANES measurements reveal distinct binding configurations of the catalysts under reaction conditions, with Ni3Pt/CeO2 featuring metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 contain metallic Ni. The DFT calculations on the surfaces of bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) further elucidate the potential reaction pathways for oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane, indicating that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway.

        Experimental results confirm that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits exceptional stability and minimal mass loss under reaction conditions, suggesting that coking is not the primary deactivation mechanism. This indicates that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is well-suited for long-term, efficient CO2-ODH reactions. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2, despite its high activity, may require more frequent regeneration or replacement due to its reactivity with CO2.

        The synergistic effects between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are evident in their respective performances, particularly when compared to monometallic catalysts. For instance, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows a significantly higher propylene yield (1.6% C3H6 yield) compared to Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%), suggesting a cooperative interaction between the metals that enhances the catalytic activity. Similarly, the activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt are found to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating the energy required for these reactions and the effectiveness of each catalyst in overcoming these barriers.

        The comprehensive analysis of these catalysts underscores their potential for environmentally benign catalysis, contributing to global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The findings not only offer valuable insights into the catalytic mechanisms but also pave the way for future research and development in the field of bimetallic catalysts for CO2 utilization. The experimental and theoretical approaches employed in this study provide a solid foundation for understanding the complex interactions between the catalysts and the reactants, highlighting the importance of metal composition and support in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

        Looking ahead, the integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggest that future research could focus on refining the catalyst compositions and supports to further enhance their performance. There is a particular opportunity to explore the use of different metal pairs and ratios, as well as the effects of support materials on the catalytic properties. Additionally, the integration of advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy, could provide real-time information about the catalyst behavior during the reactions, enabling a more detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the dynamic changes in the catalysts. This knowledge could lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2 utilization, contributing to the mitigation of environmental challenges associated with CO2 emissions.

        对于丙烷在CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的双金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2的比较分析，通过实验和理论（DFT）研究进行了深入探讨。这些催化剂由贵金属（Pt或Pd）与非贵金属（Fe、Co或Ni）组成的二元体系合成，以及非贵金属组合，均支持在CeO2上。研究表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2具有独特性能，其中前者在CO2-ODHP途径中对丙烯选择性生产表现出优势，而后者在DRP中对CO具有高选择性。

        这些催化剂的选择性和活性评估通过CO2转化率与CO选择性进行，提供了它们在转化为所需产品的效率洞察。与使用O2的传统氧化导致产生CO2的过氧化不同，CO2-ODH反应导致CO2净减少，因为CO2被消耗而不是产生。原位XANES测量揭示了催化剂在反应条件下的不同结合结构，Ni3Pt/CeO2表现为金属Pt，而Fe3Ni/CeO2和Ni3Pt/CeO2包含金属Ni。对表面的DFT计算在bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111)和Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111)上进一步阐明了丙烷氧化性CH和CC键裂解的潜在反应路径，表明Ni3Pt(111)上的CC键裂解路径更优，而bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111)则倾向于CH键裂解路径。

        实验结果证实，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在反应条件下表现出出色的稳定性和微小的质量损失，暗示焦炭化不是其主要失活机制。这表明Fe3Ni1/CeO2适用于长期、高效的CO2-ODH反应。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2尽管活性较高，可能需要更频繁的再生或更换，因为它与CO2的反应性。

        Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2之间存在的协同效应在它们各自的性能中表现得尤为明显，尤其是与单金属催化剂相比时。例如，Fe3Ni1/CeO2的丙烯产率（1.6% C3H6产率）显著高于Ni（0.4%）和Fe（0.2%），表明两种金属之间的合作提高了催化活性。同样，Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt的CO2-ODHP和DRP激活能分别为115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1，说明这些反应的能量要求以及每种催化剂克服这些障碍的有效性。

        这些催化剂的全面分析不仅为环境友好的催化提供了宝贵见解，还促进了全球烯烃生产和CO2排放减少。这项研究不仅提供了关于催化机制的重要信息，也为未来研究和开发领域铺平了道路。实验和理论方法的应用为理解催化剂与反应物之间的复杂相互作用提供了坚实的基础，突出了金属组成和支持在实现最佳催化性能方面的重要性。

        展望未来，对于催化剂组成的整合理解和前瞻性展望表明，未来研究可以专注于改进催化剂组成和支撑材料以进一步提高其性能。特别有潜力探索不同金属对和比例，以及支撑材料对催化性质的影响。此外，集成先进的表征技术，如操作光谱学，可以提供有关催化剂行为的实时信息，在反应期间，这将有助于更详细地了解催化机制和催化剂动态变化。这种知识可以导致开发更高效和可持续的CO2利用催化剂，从而对减轻与CO2排放相关的环境挑战做出贡献。
