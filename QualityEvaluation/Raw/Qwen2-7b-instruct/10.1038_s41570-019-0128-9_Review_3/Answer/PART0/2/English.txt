Previous studies on CO2-ODH have focused on supported chromium catalysts due to their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states, but their implementation is hindered by their short lifecycles and high toxicity. Nickel is commonly used for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking remains an issue. The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, exhibits propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction with a 58.2% C3H6 selectivity at steady-state. When nickel is alloyed with precious metal platinum, reforming activity is enhanced compared to monometallic Ni3. Fe3Ni shows high selectivity for propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt is active for DRP with high selectivity towards CO. Kinetic studies and in situ XANES measurements help evaluate the differences between the two catalysts. DFT calculations predict the Fe3Ni(111) surface favors CH bond scission for CO2-ODHP, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors CC bond cleavage for DRP. Flow reactor results confirm the DFT predictions, indicating that Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production, while Ni3Pt shows good activity and CO selectivity. Efforts should focus on developing more stable and selective catalytic materials to enhance propylene yield.
