"CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10 Just as experimental and DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2+C2H6, a similar treatment can be done for CO2+C3H8 at 823K."
          "The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101)."
          "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."
          "The catalysts' selectivity and activity can be assessed by plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity."
          "Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced."
          "In situ XANES measurements indicate that Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0."
          "The results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface."
          "According to thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions."

[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
          [2] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometals (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
          [3] "The apparent activation energies were derived by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 803–843 K. Over Fe3Ni, the activation barrier for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation was found to be 115 kJ mol−1, while the activation barrier for reforming over Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol−1."
          [4] "The TGA results indicate that the Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
          [5] "The in-situ XANES measurements identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."
          [6] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces to further gain insight into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2+H2O(g) and *CH3CH2+*CO+H2O(g), respectively."
          [7] "The DFT results revealed that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."
