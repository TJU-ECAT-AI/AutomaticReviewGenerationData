The provided answers discuss the comparison of bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. They highlight the catalysts' selectivity, stability, and activity, and how these are evaluated through experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies. The answers also touch upon the catalysts' synergistic effects, potential for environmentally benign catalysis, and implications for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 is selective for propylene production through CO2-ODHP, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is active for DRP with high selectivity towards CO. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect increasing propylene yield compared to monometals. The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt. The Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting deactivation is unlikely due to coking. Both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions. DFT calculations predict that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway.
