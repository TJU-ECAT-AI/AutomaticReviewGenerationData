          [1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
          [2] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometals (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
          [3] "The apparent activation energies were derived by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 803–843 K. Over Fe3Ni, the activation barrier for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation was found to be 115 kJ mol−1, while the activation barrier for reforming over Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol−1."
          [4] "The TGA results indicate that the Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
          [5] "The in-situ XANES measurements identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."
          [6] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces to further gain insight into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2+H2O(g) and *CH3CH2+*CO+H2O(g), respectively."
          [7] "The DFT results revealed that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

          The bimetallic catalyst Fe3Ni/CeO2 is selective for propylene production through CO2-ODHP, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is active for DRP with high selectivity towards CO. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect increasing propylene yield compared to monometals. The activation barriers for CO2-ODHP and DRP are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively, over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt. The Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability with minimal mass loss, suggesting deactivation is unlikely due to coking. Both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni under reaction conditions. DFT calculations predict that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway.

          Fe3Ni/CeO2催化剂通过CO2-ODHP途径表现出对丙烯的选择性，而Ni3Pt/CeO2在DRP中显示出对CO的高选择性。Fe3Ni催化剂展示了与单金属相比增加丙烯产率的协同效应。CO2-ODHP和DRP的活化能分别是115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1，分别在Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt上。Fe3Ni催化剂保持稳定性，仅损失少量原始质量，表明主要的失活途径不太可能是结焦。Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt在反应条件下均由金属Ni组成。DFT计算预测，Ni3Pt(111)表面的CC键裂解路径占优势，而Fe3Ni(111)表面的CH键裂解路径更为有利。

          [1] "Previous work in CO2-ODH primarily focuses on supported chromium catalysts1315 as a result of their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states16, but implementation is limited due to short lifecycles and high toxicity of chromium17. Ni is mainly used for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking is still a problem1820."
          [2] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."
          [3] "In contrast, when Ni is alloyed with precious metal Pt, reforming activity is enhanced compared to monometallic Ni3."
          [4] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
          [5] "Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts."
          [6] "Oxidation states by in situ XANES. In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. 3."
          [7] "DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."
          [8] "Flow reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations as it was observed that the Fe3Ni catalyst is selective for propylene production, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows good activity and CO selectivity."
          [9] "Future efforts should be geared toward enhancing propylene yield through the discovery of more stable and selective catalytic materials."

          Previous studies on CO2-ODH have focused on supported chromium catalysts due to their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states, but their implementation is hindered by their short lifecycles and high toxicity. Nickel is commonly used for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking remains an issue. The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, exhibits propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction with a 58.2% C3H6 selectivity at steady-state. When nickel is alloyed with precious metal platinum, reforming activity is enhanced compared to monometallic Ni3. Fe3Ni shows high selectivity for propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt is active for DRP with high selectivity towards CO. Kinetic studies and in situ XANES measurements help evaluate the differences between the two catalysts. DFT calculations predict the Fe3Ni(111) surface favors CH bond scission for CO2-ODHP, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors CC bond cleavage for DRP. Flow reactor results confirm the DFT predictions, indicating that Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production, while Ni3Pt shows good activity and CO selectivity. Efforts should focus on developing more stable and selective catalytic materials to enhance propylene yield.

          以往关于CO2-ODH的研究主要集中在能够存在多种氧化状态的支撑铬催化剂上，但其实施受到寿命短和毒性高的限制。镍主要用于干重整，但由于严重的结焦导致催化剂失效的问题依然存在。Fe3Ni双金属系统在稳态下从CO2-ODHP反应中产生丙烯，具有58.2%的C3H6选择性。当镍与贵重金属铂合金时，重整活性相对于单一金属Ni3增强。Fe3Ni通过CO2-ODHP途径显示出对丙烯的高选择性，而Ni3Pt在DRP中显示出对CO的高选择性。动力学研究和原位XANES测量有助于评估两种催化剂之间的差异。DFT计算预测Fe3Ni(111)表面有利于CO2-ODHP途径中的CH键断裂，而Pt-终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面有利于DRP途径中的CC键裂解。流动反应器的结果与DFT计算一致，表明Fe3Ni在丙烯生产方面具有选择性，而Ni3Pt显示出良好的活性和CO选择性。未来应致力于开发更加稳定和选择性的催化剂材料以提高丙烯产量。
