The TCD reaction requires more than 1500 K to achieve a reasonable yield without a catalyst. However, both metal and carbon materials are active catalysts that can lower the reaction temperature. High product yields are obtained with carbon catalysts in the temperature range of 11001300 K while the reaction temperature range is 7001100 K with metal catalysts.

The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure hydrogen and solid carbon requires over 1500 K without a catalyst. Metal and carbon materials can act as catalysts to reduce the reaction temperature. Carbon catalysts yield high products in the temperature range of 1100-1300 K, while metal catalysts work within the range of 700-1100 K.

View Article Online TCD industrial application is still to be developed. In the laboratory, a circulating uidized bed is used to develop a continuous process, but this process requires the regeneration of the catalysts by oxidation, resulting in the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases (CO and CO2).

The industrial application of TCD is still in development. In the laboratory, a circulating fluidized bed is employed to create a continuous process, but this necessitates the regeneration of catalysts through oxidation, leading to the emission of substantial quantities of greenhouse gases (CO and CO2).
