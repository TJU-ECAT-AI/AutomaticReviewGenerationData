The reforming of methane to syngas is a crucial industrial process for utilizing methane on a large scale. The syngas produced can be used in various chemical synthesis routes, such as methanol synthesis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which are essential for producing hydrocarbons. About 48% of the world's hydrogen production relies on steam reforming of methane. Smaller nickel particles, with sizes below 1 nm, can significantly reduce coke formation on the metal surface. Noble catalysts like rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and palladium (Pd) have been the focus of initial research, with Ru and Rh showing particularly high activity. The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane provides a straightforward method for hydrogen production with the added benefit of generating value-added carbon products. Metal oxides, notably lithium magnesium oxide (LiMgO) and tungsten manganese silicoxygen (WMnSiO2), have been extensively studied for their effectiveness in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction. In the WMnSiO2 catalyst, sodium (Na) plays a crucial role in suppressing methane over-oxidation and facilitating the migration of manganese (Mn) and tungsten (W) to the catalyst surface.
