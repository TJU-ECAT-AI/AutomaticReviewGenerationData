[1] "Presently, in industry, methane is transformed into bulk chemicals by the indirect route. That is, methane is converted into syngas (CO + H2) at an elevated temperature (>973 K),3,4 and then the syngas is used to make a wide spectrum of hydrocarbons or alcohols with the use of catalysts.5,6"
[2] "The first process has better atomic economy since the oxygen atom in CO is included in the product, whereas the oxygen atom of CO and some hydrogen atoms are wasted in the form of water in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis."
[3] "The reforming of methane to syngas (CO + H2) is the most important industrial process that utilizes methane in large scale industrial applications at present."
[4] "These combined reforming reactions are called bi-/tri-reforming processes. For example, Olah et al. suggested that bi-reforming of methane to syngas with a CO : H2 ratio of 1 : 2 is possible under high pressures, and this can be used directly in methanol synthesis."
[5] "The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure hydrogen and solid carbon, shown in eqn (4), is another process for the transformation of methane with high selectivity."
[6] "First, using solar energy to split water to hydrogen and oxygen is still far from the practical applications. Secondly, the electrol- ysis of water to high-quality hydrogen, although well established, also needs more energy than the TCD process."
[7] "Despite much effort devoted to the OCM reaction, only a few catalysts can give a C2+ yield higher than 25% and selectivity to C2+ higher than 80%, which are the minimum criteria for its industrial applications."

The direct conversion of methane into syngas (CO + H2) at elevated temperatures is the most common industrial process. This syngas is then used to produce a variety of hydrocarbons and alcohols through catalytic reactions. The process of converting methane into syngas is more economically viable than the complete oxidation of methane. Bi-/tri-reforming processes, which combine multiple reforming reactions, can adjust the CO : H2 ratio in the product. Thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane can yield pure hydrogen and solid carbon with high selectivity. The TCD process does not produce CO or CO2, simplifying the gas separation process. Electrolysis of water to produce high-quality hydrogen requires more energy than the TCD process. Only a few catalysts can achieve the minimum industrial criteria for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction, with yields and selectivities below 25% and 80%, respectively.

目前，工业上通过间接途径将甲烷转化为大量化学物质。具体来说，甲烷在高于973K的温度下转化为合成气（CO + H2），然后使用催化剂将其转化为一系列烃类或醇类。与费希尔-特罗斯合成相比，合成气的原子经济性更好，因为CO中的氧原子包含在产物中，而CO和水中的部分氢原子则被浪费掉。甲烷到合成气的转化是当前大规模工业应用最重要的过程。生物-/三重重整过程可以结合多个重整反应来调整产物中的CO : H2比例。热催化分解（TCD）可以高效地将甲烷转化为纯氢气和固体碳。TCD过程不会产生CO或CO2，简化了气体分离过程。电解水制取高纯度氢气比TCD过程需要更多的能量。仅少数催化剂能够达到工业应用的最低标准，即OCM反应的产率和选择性分别低于25%和80%。
