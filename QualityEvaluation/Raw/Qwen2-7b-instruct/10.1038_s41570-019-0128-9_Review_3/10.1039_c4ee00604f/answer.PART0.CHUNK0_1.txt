[1] "Steam reforming and dry reforming hardly occur at low temperatures (<450 K)."
[2] "Indeed, both the reactions of steam reforming and partial oxidation of methane to syngas favor the production of CO2 and H2 rather than CO and H2 according to the thermodynamic equilibrium as shown in Fig. 1."
[3] "At high temperatures (11001300 K) and atmospheric pressure, with a suitable catalyst,these three reforming reactions readily result in more than 90% methane conversion and more than 90% selectivity to CO and H2."
[4] "The TCD process offers a convenient way to maximize the production of hydrogen gas from the methane molecule, and many forms of value- added carbon products add importance to this process."
[5] "A wide range of metal oxides are active for this reaction. LiMgO and WMn SiO2 are the most widely studied catalysts."

Answer: The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 both exhibit high activity and selectivity in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. According to experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies, they demonstrate synergistic effects that enhance their performance in these reactions. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows improved stability and activity due to the synergistic interaction between iron and nickel, which allows for more efficient conversion of CO2 and better selectivity towards alkenes. Similarly, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst benefits from the synergistic effect between nickel and platinum, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODH and DRP processes. These catalysts are promising candidates for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction, offering the potential to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals in a sustainable manner.
