[1] "These materials show remarkable catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (OHDE) with CO2 as oxidant."
[2] "While flame-made pure titania is nearly inactive, the catalytic performance of Ga-loaded TiO2 increases strongly with increasing Ga content up to about 10 wt %, affording an ethene yield of 22%."
[3] "Higher Ga loading proved to be unfavorable, due to enhanced cracking and carbon deposition."
[4] "In addition to Ga loading, the feed ratio CO2/C2H6, temperature, and space velocity in the tubular fixed-bed microreactor were found to be crucial for achieving optimal ethene yield."
[5] "Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity."

[8] "The deactivated catalysts could be easily regenerated by air in a short time (10 min) at a reaction temperature of 700 C."
[9] "If air was used instead of CO2 as oxidant in the reaction, carbon deposition was lower, resulting in less prominent catalyst deactivation."
[10] "With air as oxidant, the selectivity to ethene was much lower due to enhanced further oxidation of ethene, affording significantly lower ethene yield in comparison to the reaction with CO2."

Answer: 
1. These materials demonstrate exceptional catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2 as an oxidant. 

Answer: 
2. The catalytic performance of Ga-loaded TiO2 significantly improves with increasing Ga content up to around 10 wt%, yielding an ethene output of 22%.

Answer: 
3. Higher Ga loading negatively impacts the catalyst due to increased cracking and carbon deposition.

Answer: 
4. The CO2/C2H6 ratio, temperature, and space velocity in the tubular fixed-bed reactor are critical factors for optimizing ethene yield.

Answer: 
5. There's a clear correlation between ethane conversion and ethene selectivity; higher ethane conversion correlates with lower ethene selectivity.

Answer: 
6. The Raman spectra of the catalysts display the presence of both D- and G-type carbon.

Answer: 
7. The accumulation of carbon enhances ethene selectivity by reducing ethane conversion.
