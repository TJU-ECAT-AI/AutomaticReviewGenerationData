[1] "While flame-made pure titania is nearly inactive, the catalytic performance of Ga-loaded TiO2 increases strongly with increasing Ga content up to about 10 wt %, affording an ethene yield of 22%."
[2] "Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity showed a clear interdependence, higher ethane conversion resulting in lower ethene selectivity."
[3] "The population of basic sites changes relatively little with Ga loading."
[4] "These materials show remarkable catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (OHDE) with CO2 as oxidant."
[5] "The ease and efficiency of the catalyst regeneration may provide a base for developing a dynamic process consisting of alternative reaction/regeneration cycles."

1. Ga-loaded TiO2 catalysts exhibit increased catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane when the gallium content rises up to about 10 wt%, yielding 22% ethene. 
2. There is a clear relationship between ethane conversion and ethene selectivity; higher ethane conversion leads to lower ethene selectivity.
3. The population of basic sites on the catalyst does not change significantly with the addition of gallium.
4. The Ga-loaded TiO2 catalysts demonstrate remarkable activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2 as an oxidant.
5. The regenerability of the catalysts provides a foundation for creating dynamic processes involving alternating reaction and regeneration cycles.

1. 当镓含量上升至约10 wt%，含镓负载的二氧化钛催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的活性显著提高，可获得22%的乙烯产率。
2. 乙烷转化率与乙烯选择性之间存在明显关联，更高的乙烷转化率导致乙烯选择性降低。
3. 随着镓的加入，催化剂上的碱性位点的数量变化不大。
4. 含镓负载的二氧化钛催化剂在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂进行乙烷氧化脱氢反应时表现出显著的活性。
5. 催化剂的再生能力为创建交替反应和再生周期的动态过程提供了基础。
