1. Higher gallium loading led to more severe coking due to stronger acidic sites.
2. Achieving an ethene yield of 22% required a CO2/C2H6 ratio of 2.5, a reaction temperature of 700°C, and a space velocity of 6000 L/((kg of cat.) h).
3. Up to 10 wt % gallium loading increased ethene yield.
4. CO2/C2H6 ratio, reaction temperature, and space velocity influenced maximum ethene yield.
5. Changes in Raman bands of TiO2 were observed depending on gallium content in spent catalysts.
6. The rutile content of TiO2 was greater than 90 wt % after oxidative dehydrogenation.
7. Activity of both commercial Ga2O3 and 10% Ga/TiO2 catalysts declined with time on stream.
8. Severe coking was the main cause of catalyst deactivation.

1. 更高的镓加载导致更严重的结焦，由于更强的酸性位点。
2. 要实现22%的乙烯产率，需要CO2/C2H6比为2.5、反应温度为700°C和空间速度为6000 L/((kg of cat.) h)。
3. 最多至10 wt %的镓加载增加了乙烯产率。
4. CO2/C2H6比、反应温度和空间速度影响最大乙烯产率。
5. 随着镓含量的不同，在失活催化剂中观察到TiO2的拉曼带强度发生变化。
6. TiO2在氧化脱氢后，其锐钛矿含量大于90 wt %。
7. 两种商用Ga2O3和10% Ga/TiO2催化剂的活性随时间下降。
8. 严重的结焦是催化剂失效的主要原因。
