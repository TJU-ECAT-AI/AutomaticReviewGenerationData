Methane activation: the past and future
Pei Tang,a Qingjun Zhu,b Zhaoxuan Wua and Ding Ma*a
The conversion of methane to more valuable chemicals is one of the most intensively studied topics in
catalysis. The direct conversion of methane is attractive because the process is simple, but unfortunately
its products are chemicals that are more reactive than methane. The current status of this research ﬁeld
is discussed with an emphasis on C–H bond activation and future challenges.
1.
Introduction
Methane is the main component in natural gas and methane
clathrates, and with the depletion of petroleum reserves, it will
become the most important hydrocarbon feedstock for the
synthesis of fuels and chemicals. The development of hydraulic
fracturing technology and the possible exploitation of shale gas
have signicantly increased the recoverable reserves and
supplies of natural gas.1 Consequently, chemical processes
based on methane activation are getting more economically
attractive. Nevertheless, because most of the methane is burned
for heating and electrical generation and a tiny fraction is used
as a fuel in vehicles, the carbon and hydrogen contents in this
hydrocarbon resource are not utilized to their full potential in
the chemical industry.2 This is because methane, with the
highest hydrogen to carbon atom ratio among the hydrocar-
bons, has four strong and localized C–H bonds (bond energy of
413 kJ mol1), and the absence of low-energy empty orbitals and
high-energy lled orbitals makes it diﬃcult for methane to
readily participate in a chemical reaction.
Presently, in industry, methane is transformed into bulk
chemicals by the indirect route. That is, methane is converted
into syngas (CO + H2) at an elevated temperature (>973 K),3,4 and
then the syngas is used to make a wide spectrum of hydrocar-
bons or alcohols with the use of catalysts.5,6 The process is
energy intensive and the cost is high, and so it would be useful
to lower the reaction temperature for the transformation of
methane into chemicals. Ironically, the direct conversion of
methane to derivatives, e.g., methanol, is thermodynamically
feasible, but kinetically diﬃcult.7,8 Moreover, methanol or some
other products or intermediates are more reactive than the CH4
reactant, and so the kinetic protection or the selective separa-
tion of the product is necessary, which leads to more challenges
in the chemical process. However, much eﬀort has been
devoted to direct methane conversion to produce the desired
chemicals in high yields in order to make the direct conversion
process economically competitive with the indirect route. Many
researchers have given examples of how C–H bond conversion
can be controlled with the use of catalysts and the correct
reaction environment. The ultimate goal of these studies is the
development of strategies to exploit methane resources more
eﬃciently and cleanly.
The scope of this mini-review is limited to the one-step
reaction of methane conversion. We restrict our discussion to
reactions that have been clearly shown to involve C–H bond
scission and the subsequent functionalization of the carbon
atom in methane. The examples include reactions that are in
the initial stage of fundamental study and those that have been
used in industrial applications for years. We categorized our
reactions into four types on the basis of the degree of C–H bond
removal and the oxidation states of the carbon atom in the nal
product: (1) complete C–H bond removal from methane and
partial oxidation of the carbon atom; (2) complete C–H bond
removal from methane to give carbon black and hydrogen; (3)
partial C–H bond removal from methane and further C–C
coupling reaction to form chemicals such as C2 hydrocarbons
and aromatics; and (4) partial C–H bond removal and their
substitution by heteroatom functional groups. The examples
discussed are chosen to illustrate how methane activity is
controlled by the use of diﬀerent catalysts, oxidants or the
reaction environment. A detailed understanding of C–H bond
activation in direct methane conversion is crucial for process
development.

Complete C–H bond removal and
the partial oxidation of carbon:
production of CO and H2
The complete oxidation of methane at low temperatures is
thermodynamically favorable. More important is that the
resulting mixture of CO2 and H2O is of less value in the

chemical industry, whereas converting methane to syngas (CO +
H2) with an oxidant is much more attractive than the complete
oxidation of methane.9 These processes of converting methane
to syngas are called the reforming of methane. The reforming of
methane to syngas (CO + H2) is the most important industrial
process that utilizes methane in large scale industrial applica-
tions at present. Syngas, which is a very versatile intermediate,
can be used in methanol synthesis with Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts
or in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis on Fe, Co or Ru catalysts to
produce hydrocarbons.6,10 The rst process has better atomic
economy since the oxygen atom in CO is included in the
product, whereas the oxygen atom of CO and some hydrogen
atoms are wasted in the form of water in Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis.
There are three possible reforming processes for the
conversion of methane to syngas: steam reforming shown in
eqn (1), CO2 reforming (dry reforming) shown in eqn (2), and
partial oxidation of methane to syngas shown in eqn (3). These
three reforming processes produce syngas with diﬀerent CO/H2
ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3).

Thermodynamics indicate that steam reforming and dry
reforming hardly occur at low temperatures (<450 K). Indeed, both
the reactions of steam reforming and partial oxidation of methane
to syngas favor the production of CO2 and H2 rather than CO and
H2 according to the thermodynamic equilibrium as shown in
Fig. 1. Also, high pressure reaction conditions neither favor the
formation of CO and H2 nor the conversion of methane.11 The
thermodynamic data of the reaction of partial oxidation of
methane to syngas are shown in Fig. 1. At high temperatures
(1100–1300 K) and atmospheric pressure, with a suitable catalyst,
these three reforming reactions readily result in more than 90%
methane conversion and more than 90% selectivity to CO and H2.
However, high temperature reaction conditions mean that the
costs are very high in the industrial operations.
The steam reforming of methane is a well-established
process in industry. This process is widely used to produce
syngas for methanol synthesis, and hydrogen for ammonia
synthesis and rening processes. About 48% of the hydrogen in
the world is produced by steam reforming.12 However, hot spots
in the catalyst bed and high temperature reaction conditions
cause diﬃculties in the operation, and excess steam is needed
to suppress the formation of coke.11 In contrast, CO2 reforming
consumes two greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) to make the
valuable syngas. This reaction not only mitigates CO2 and CH4
emission but also provides an eﬀective way to utilize low grade
natural gas resources consisting of CH4 and CO2, e.g., coal bed
gas. Nevertheless, the catalyst is readily deactivated, and excess
CO2 has to be used to remove the coke.4,13 Interestingly, the
reaction of partial oxidation of methane to syngas is the only
methane reforming process that is exothermic with an optimal
CO : H2 ratio (1 : 2) in the reaction product, but this reaction
still needs high temperatures (1100–1200 K) in order to obtain
CO and H2. The main problems in the partial oxidation of
methane to syngas are safety issues. First, a mixture of methane
and oxygen is extremely dangerous in industrial application.
Second, the partial oxidation of methane to syngas is only
autonomous at high temperature, where the reaction is very
diﬃcult to control. Finally, hot spots formed in this autono-
mous oxidative process are diﬃcult to handle and would result
in local overheating.3,4 In addition to these issues, the stability
of the catalyst is another factor that prevents this process from
being industrialized. In order to overcome the catalyst deacti-
vation problem, the catalysts are carefully designed, particularly
in the choice and modication of the support and the addition
of auxiliary metals.6,14 It was found that the metal crystallite size
strongly aﬀects the coke formation rate.15 When Ni particles are
smaller than 1 nm, almost no coke is formed on the metal
surface.16
It is interesting to note that all three reforming processes
show similar orders of activity on diﬀerent catalysts. Most of the
initial research focused on the noble catalysts of Rh, Ir, Pt, Ru
and Pd, with Ru and Rh being the most active.3 For non-noble
metals, Ni-based catalysts have the highest catalytic activity and
their activity is even comparable to those of the noble metal
catalysts in all three reforming processes.17 The similarities
among these reforming processes18 make it possible to combine
two or three of these reforming reactions to adjust the nal
CO : H2 ratio in the product as the three reforming reactions

give diﬀerent CO : H2 ratios. These combined reforming reac-
tions are called bi-/tri-reforming processes. For example, Olah
et al. suggested that bi-reforming of methane to syngas with a
CO : H2 ratio of 1 : 2 is possible under high pressures, and this
can be used directly in methanol synthesis.19 The tri-reforming
process is more economical if the exothermic partial oxidation
process is combined with the endothermic steam reforming
and CO2 reforming, which can give a new reaction route to
prevent hot spots and coke formation in the reaction.20 In
addition to the catalytic reforming reactions above, the non-
catalytic
homogeneous
partial
oxidation
of
methane
for
synthesis gas production, even though kinetically unfavorable,
is also well-established and applied.21

Complete C–H bond removal:
production of C and H2
The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure
hydrogen and solid carbon, shown in eqn (4), is another process
for the transformation of methane with high selectivity. Unlike
the reforming processes, the TCD process only produces solid
carbon and hydrogen. The absence of CO or CO2 implies a
simple gas product separation process yielding high quality
hydrogen. Meanwhile, diﬀerent types of carbon, such as
amorphous carbons, carbon nanobers, carbon nanotubes
(see Fig. 2) and layered carbon materials, can be produced
depending on the operating conditions.22,23 The TCD process
oﬀers a convenient way to maximize the production of hydrogen
gas from the methane molecule, and many forms of value-
added carbon products add importance to this process.

(4)
The TCD reaction requires more than 1500 K to achieve a
reasonable yield without a catalyst. However, both metal and
carbon materials are active catalysts that can lower the reaction
temperature. High product yields are obtained with carbon
catalysts in the temperature range of 1100–1300 K while the
reaction temperature range is 700–1100 K with metal catalysts.
The rate of methane decomposition activity on the transition
metals follows the order: Co, Ru, Ni, Rh > Pt, Re, Ir > Pd, Cu, W,
Fe, Mo.22 Currently, most of the research is focused on Ni- and
Fe-based catalysts. The metal loading for the supported cata-
lysts used in this process is usually more than 10% which is
high compared to normal supported metal catalysts. For
example, for Ni-based catalysts, the optimum loading of Ni was
40%, while the particle size of the Ni catalysts is pivotal for good
activity.24,25 In the TCD process, although the production of
solid carbon facilitates the gas separation, the drawback is that
the large amounts of carbon formed cover and poison the
catalysts as well as change the morphology and composition of
metal catalysts, which leads to severe deactivation of the cata-
lysts.22,23,25,26 The choice of the support and the addition of
promoters are widely used to enhance the tolerance of carbo-
naceous deposits.22,23
Interestingly, carbon materials themselves can catalyze the
TCD reaction. A diﬀerent kinetics behavior was observed with
carbon materials as compared with that of metal catalysts,
illustrating the catalytic eﬀect of carbon in the TCD reaction.27
Various carbon materials have been tested in the TCD reactions.
Amorphous carbons (e.g., activated carbon and carbon black)
are more active than well-ordered carbons (e.g., graphite and
carbon nanotubes).27–29 The carbon deposits produced in the
reaction also dramatically reduce the surface area of the carbon
catalyst, which leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. With
activated carbon and carbon black, which are the most widely
used catalysts, activated carbon shows a higher initial reaction
rate and a faster deactivation rate than carbon black. It was
suggested that the pores in activated carbon, especially the
micropores, are readily blocked by the carbonaceous deposits,
whereas the surface of carbon black is much more accessible to
methane since the size of the carbon black particles is between
10 and 250 nm.28,30 Defects in the carbon materials are believed
to be the active sites for the TCD reaction. In some cases, as the
TCD reaction proceeds, the newly formed carbon is responsible
for the activation of methane.27,30
The TCD process is not industrially used because it is not yet
economically
competitive
with
the
well-developed
steam
reforming process of methane. However, with the increasing
demand for high quality hydrogen, the TCD process is getting
more attractive as the pure hydrogen produced this way, with
the absence of CO and CO2, is suitable for fuel cells.22,23 The
water splitting reaction (2H2O ¼ 2H2 + O2, DH ¼ 484 kJ mol1) is
another important reaction to produce high-quality hydrogen.
First, using solar energy to split water to hydrogen and oxygen is
still far from the practical applications. Secondly, the electrol-
ysis of water to high-quality hydrogen, although well estab-
lished, also needs more energy than the TCD process. It is
because the DH of this reaction is much higher than that of the
TCD reaction and this process costs electricity, the eﬃciency of
which is limited by the electricity generation and trans-
portation. Therefore, as methane has the highest H/C ratio in
fossil fuel, we propose that the TCD process would play a more
and more important role in the production of hydrogen in the
future. The reasons why this process is not applied on a large
scale are: rst, a continuous reaction process that is suitable for

TCD industrial application is still to be developed. In the
laboratory, a circulating uidized bed is used to develop a
continuous process, but this process requires the regeneration
of the catalysts by oxidation, resulting in the release of large
amounts of greenhouse gases (CO and CO2).31 Second, carbon
market value is believed to be a key factor in the economics of
the TCD process.23,32 If this process is industrialized, it will
produce huge amounts of carbon each year. Therefore,
producing uniform types of carbon and nding suitable appli-
cations for these carbons are the key factors that govern the
viability of the TCD process.

Partial C–H bond removal and C–
C bond formation: production of
hydrocarbons
4.1
Ethane and ethylene
Ethylene, a main building block in the chemical society, is now
obtained by the pyrolysis of naphtha and dehydrogenation of
ethane. The direct conversion of methane to ethylene would
provide an alternative to these traditional processes based on
petroleum and syngas.
In the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction, shown
in eqn (5) and (6), methane is directly converted into ethane,
ethylene and water in the presence of oxygen and a suitable
catalyst. Ethylene, as one of the most important building feed-
stocks in polymer industry, could be converted to propylene or
polymerized to polyethylene. Ethane could be easily converted
to ethylene by an oxidative dehydrogenation process. This
reaction has been extensively studied and reviewed in the
literature.33–36 Briey, the reaction proceeds by a two-step
process. First, oxidized catalyst sites abstract H from CH4, and
the resulting methyl radicals couple to form ethane. The exis-
tence of methyl radicals has been shown by synchrotron VUV
photoionization mass spectroscopy.37 In the second step, the
ethane dehydrogenates to produce ethylene. A wide range of
metal oxides are active for this reaction. Li–MgO and W–Mn–
SiO2 are the most widely studied catalysts. Some typical results
are shown in Table 1. Despite much eﬀort devoted to the OCM
reaction, only a few catalysts can give a C2+ yield higher than
25% and selectivity to C2+ higher than 80%, which are the
minimum criteria for its industrial applications.38

The Li/MgO catalyst was shown to be very active in the OCM
reaction by Lunsford et al. Lithium in the catalyst create surface
defects and favor the formation of O, which is believed to be
responsible for the activation of methane.33,39 However, the Li/
MgO catalysts are unstable under the reaction conditions, and
deactivation occurs because of the loss of Li and sintering of the
catalysts. Various dopants such as auxiliary metals and Cl are
used to modify the Li/MgO catalysts to improve the stability and
the selectivity towards C2.6,39 The W–Mn–SiO2 catalyst is also
one of the most active catalysts in the OCM reaction. In this
catalyst, Na is proposed to suppress the over-oxidation of
methane and favor the migration of Mn and W to the catalyst
surface. Both the Na–O–W and Na–O–Mn species are the active
sites in this reaction. The near-surface concentration of Mn was
correlated with CH4 conversion and C2H4 selectivity. Concern-
ing the W species, both tetrahedral WO4 and octahedral WO6
were found on the catalyst surface, and WO4 was more active
and selective for the reaction.34,40 Beside pure oxygen, other
oxidants such as CO2 have been used in the OCM reaction as
well, although their C2 yields are much lower.41,42
As the main problem in the OCM reaction is that the activity
of ethane and ethylene products are much higher than that of
methane in the oxygen atmosphere, a “so” oxidant that has
less oxidation ability may partly solve this problem. Recently, a
process using S2 as a mild oxidant to oxidize methane to ethane
and ethylene was developed.43 The thermodynamic data for S2
and O2 are shown in Fig. 3. The metal suldes used as the
catalysts were like the metal oxides in the OCM reaction. The
bond energy of the C–S bond is believed to play an important
role in controlling the activation of methane. However, this
mild oxidation process needs a higher reaction temperature
than the traditional oxidation process using oxygen.
The non-oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) reactions,
shown in eqn (7) and (8), to ethane and ethylene are thermo-
dynamically unfavorable. However, due to high selectivity and
low reaction temperatures, this reaction still attracted much

research attention. The reaction occurs by a two-step process.
First, methane is chemisorbed on the surface of catalyst. Then
the cleavage of C–H bonds occurs, resulting in the formation of
H2 and H-decient carbon species such as CHX. When the CHX
coverage on the surface of the catalyst is high, C–C bond
coupling occurs. In the second step of the reaction, hydrogen is
introduced to promote formation of the C–C bond by saturating
the over-dehydrogenated CHX, and thus cleaning the surface of
catalysts for the next catalytic cycle.38,44

This reaction was rst found to be active on Pt/SiO2. At 523 K,
methane can be transformed into higher hydrocarbons such as
C2–C6 species by the two step reaction process. The selectivity to
C2 species is ca. 60%.45 In addition to this isothermal process,
methane can also form carbide and H2 on noble catalysts at a
higher temperature, and then successive hydrogenation can be
used to convert these carbide species into higher hydrocarbons.
The addition of a second metal such as Cu or Co can improve
the catalytic activity, while a higher reaction pressure promotes
the branching process and modies the molecular weight
distribution
of
the
products.38
Recently,
SiO2-supported
tantalum hydride as a well-dened catalyst was used in this
reaction. The reaction thermodynamics allows a high selectivity
(>98%) to ethane at 523–648 K.46
There are two problems with the NOCM process. First,
thermodynamic limitation makes the activity extremely low.
Second, the two-step process (at diﬀerent reaction tempera-
tures) is diﬃcult to operate industrially. While the second issue
needs engineering work, the development of a novel catalyst,47
use of membrane reactors,48 and assistance of photo- and
plasma-process can be used to promote NOCM to get better
catalytic performance.49,50
4.2
Aromatics
The methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) reaction was rst
reported in 1993.51 As shown in eqn (9), in the absence of
oxygen, methane can be converted into benzene with the release
of H2. All the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the methane
molecule are utilized in the valuable chemicals obtained,
resulting in 100% atomic use for both the carbon and hydrogen
atoms. Benzene is an important solvent in industry and also the
feedstock of phenol and p-xylene. Meanwhile, the high-quality
hydrogen (absence of CO and CO2) produced at the same time
of formation of aromatics could be used in fuel cells directly as
well as in the hydrogenation reaction where a large amount of
hydrogen was required. However, the formation of aromatic
products from CH4 in the absence of O2 is not thermodynami-
cally favorable at low temperatures (<723 K). The equilibrium
conversion of methane at 973 K is about 12%, with approxi-
mately equimolar amounts of benzene and naphthalene being
the thermodynamically preferred products.38,52 Compared with
the non-oxidative coupling of methane to C2 species, a higher
equilibrium conversion is obtained at the same temperature as
shown in Fig. 4.38
, DH(298 K) ¼ 531 kJ mol1(9)
The reaction was rst found to be active on Mo-ZSM-5.51 A
number of transition metal ions (Mo, Fe, V, W, Cr, etc.) and
supports (ZSM-5, mordenite, Y, etc.)53–55 were found to be
useable constituents in this bifunctional catalyst system. Typi-
cally, with a Mo/ZSM-5 (4–6% Mo loading) catalyst, methane
was converted to 50% benzene, 25–30% coke, 10–20% naph-
thalene and 5–10% C2 with a conversion of 10–12% at 973 K.38,56
Mo and ZSM-5 form a bifunctional catalyst to promote MDA
reactions.57,58 Molybdenum migrates into the zeolitic channel
and is exchanged with the Br¨
onsted acidic proton to form
framework Mo–O–Al species.59 Then, during the induction
period, the carbonization of Mo–O–Al species occurs to form
molybdenum carbide,60,61 which is responsible for the activation
of methane to CHX.62 On the other hand, the Br¨
onsted acid sites
that originated from the incorporation of aluminium into the
zeolite framework is responsible for the following aromatiza-
tion of the CHX species, leading to the formation of various
aromatics.63,64 The highest methane conversion and benzene

using O2 as the oxidant.

formation rate were obtained when the zeolites possess the
optimized Br¨
onsted acidity. A good balance between the
framework molybdenum species and Bronsted acid sites is
needed for excellent catalytic performance. Clearly, too much
Mo loading will consume a substantial amount of Br¨
onsted
acidic sites, and in extreme situations, this can extract frame-
work Al from the zeolite structure, resulting in the collapse of
zeolitic structure and the inhibition of aromatization.60
Heavy carbonaceous deposition was observed in the reac-
tion, which covers the active sites and blocks the channels of the
zeolites to hinder the successive aromatization reaction, leading
to signicant catalyst deactivation, as shown in Fig. 5.53,65 The
most eﬃcient way to remove coke in this reaction is by hydro-
genation, instead of the normally used oxygen regeneration.
The hydrogenation regeneration benets the stability of the
active phase, molybdenum carbide.66,67 The yields of benzene
and hydrogen from this MDA reaction have almost reached the
thermodynamic equilibrium under reaction conditions. Hence,
a careful design of reactors to separate the products is needed to
break the thermodynamic equilibrium to obtain a higher
product yield. Moreover, a uidized bed to regenerate the
catalyst and maintain the activity is needed to accomplish a
continuous industrial process.
4.3
Cross-coupling of methane with other hydrocarbons
In addition to the coupling reactions of OCM and MDA, the
carbon atom in methane can also couple with the carbon atom
of other hydrocarbon molecules, which is known as cross-
coupling reactions. The most widely studied example in this
eld is the methylation reaction of aromatics with methane
under an oxidative atmosphere. Zeolites can be used as catalysts
in the direct methylation of benzene and naphthalene. The
methyl groups in the products are from methane, which was
conrmed by
13C labeling experiments. In this reaction,
methane is activated by oxygen to form a methanol interme-
diate. Subsequently, methanol reacts with benzene to form
toluene catalyzed by the acidity in the zeolite.68 This is called
oxidative methylation. The methylation of aromatics, especially
benzene, is economically attractive since p-xylene is an impor-
tant feedstock in the ber industry. The methylation of ethylene
to propylene is also possible. The oxidative cross-coupling
process between ethylene and methane on Na–Li–MgO catalysts
gave a propylene yield of 5% (based on ethylene).69
The methylation of olens with methane under non-oxida-
tive conditions has also been reported.70 This occurs by a three-
step process. Similar to the NOCM reaction, methane exposed
to Ru/SiO2 or Co/SiO2 catalysts forms CHX at 600–800 K rst.
Then ethylene is added at a lower temperature. Finally,
hydrogen is introduced and the hydrogenation facilitates the
coupling of CHX with adsorbed ethylene to form propylene. 13C
labeled experiments showed that the propylene products were
formed from both the self-homologation of ethylene and
methane incorporation into ethylene.
As methane is much less reactive than most of the other
organic
substrates
under
the
reaction
conditions
where
methane can be activated, the organic substrates themselves are
highly liable to be converted into other products. Therefore, the
selectivity to the desired product is usually lower than 50%.
More importantly, whether methane is incorporated into the
nal products should be investigated carefully.

Reaction of methane and halogens
The activation of methane by halogenation is another impor-
tant process to convert methane into more useful chemicals.
The reaction is possible with all the halogens (F, Cl, Br and I),
shown in eqn (10)–(13), and produces the corresponding halo-
genated methane and inorganic acid. The reaction between
methane and F2, which is corrosive and toxic, is extremely
exothermic and the process is diﬃcult to control. On the other
hand, the equilibrium conversion between methane and I2 is
only 10% at 923 K, and iodomethane readily decomposes to I2
and hydrocarbons.71,72 Therefore, most of the research studies
have focused on the chlorination and bromination of methane.

Olah et al. reported that 34% methane was converted with
96% selectivity to monochloromethane over supported noble
metal and solid acid catalysts. In contrast, a methane conver-
sion of 20% and a selectivity of 99% to monobromethane were
obtained in the reaction between CH4 and Br2.73 Metal oxides
were also found to be promising catalysts in these reactions.74,75

of halogenated methane and their polar bonds make them
potential new platform molecules from methane chemistry.
First, methanol and dimethyl ether are readily obtained by the
hydrolysis of halogenated methane.73 Second, halogenated
methane can react with CO to produce acetyl halogen which is
the precursor of acetic acid.76,77 Third, CH3Cl and CH3Br can be
directly transformed into higher hydrocarbons using zeolitic
materials.72,75,78 However, although halogenated methane can
be transformed into a series of useful chemicals under quite
mild conditions with high yields, the severe corrosivity and
toxicity of the reactants and products hinder the application of
these chemical processes. In order to overcome these problems,
the oxidative halogenation of methane, shown in eqn (14) and
(15), was developed.

Traditional supported noble metal catalysts are active for
this reaction, such as Ru/SiO2. In addition, FePO4/SiO2 was
found to be a promising catalyst for the oxidative bromination
of methane.79–81 LaCl3 was also an active catalyst in the oxidative
chlorination of methane.82 Interestingly, pulse experiments
show that the Cl in LaCl3 serves as a Cl reservoir in this reaction.
Thus, La–O–Cl is believed to account for the catalytic cycle.82
The conversion of methane is promoted by the doping of Co and
Ce into LaCl3, but suppressed by a Ni promoter.83 In these
oxidative halogenation reactions, CO and CO2 are the main
byproducts. By careful control, a mixture of CH3X and CO can be
produced, which is a feedstock for the synthesis of acetic acid,
from oxidative chlorination and bromination.77,84
5.2
Introduction of other functional groups into methane
In addition to halogens, a number of other reaction types have
also been developed to introduce functional groups (–OH,
–COOH, –NH2, –NO2, etc.) to replace the hydrogen atoms in
methane. Metal salts, homogeneous complexes, zeolites and
supported metal catalysts are used to catalyze the methane
conversion to the derivatives which are mainly C1 oxygenates.
The partial oxidation of methane to methanol is an impor-
tant technological and economical challenge to meet the
enormous demand for methanol, which can be further trans-
formed into a variety of bulk chemicals in industry. This reac-
tion is thermodynamically favorable even at room temperature
and exothermic as shown in eqn (16). This reaction route is
particularly attractive from a fundamental point of view since
natural catalysts such as methane monooxygenase (MMO)
enzymes can activate methane and oxygen to produce methanol
under mild conditions.85 Zeolite supported metal catalysts are
employed to mimic the function of methane monooxygenase to
form the active di-iron or di-copper centers. Fe-ZSM-5, Cu-ZSM-
5 and Cu-mordenite are found to be able to activate methane
under mild conditions.86–88 Apart from these Fe/zeolites or
Cu/zeolites, Zn-ZSM-5 catalysts could also convert methane to
methanol and acetic acid under mild conditions.89,90 But the
methanol yields under these mild conditions are so low that
they are far from practical applications.
CH4 + 0.5O2 / CH3OH, DH(298 K) ¼ 126.4 kJ mol1 (16)
The diﬃculty in the selective oxidation of methane is that
methanol and formaldehyde are much more reactive than
methane.91,92 By using carefully designed reactors and strict
control of the reaction parameters, it is possible to get a
reasonably high selectivity to methanol.93 Beside zeolite-based
catalysts, oxide catalysts based on Mo-oxides and V-oxides are
also promising catalysts for this reaction.94,95 Table 2 lists some
typical results. N2O and H2 are promoters in partial oxidation
reactions.92,96 The direct oxidation of methane to form oxygen-
ates with more than one carbon is also possible. CH3COOH can
be obtained on Pt catalysts with co-feeding of CO and O2.97
Moreover, by using Rh–FePO4 as the catalyst, CH3COOCH3 can
be produced from the reaction of N2O, CO and methane.98
The hydrogen atoms in methane can also be replaced by N-
containing groups, and some of those processes have been
industrialized for decades. For example, CH4 can react with NH3
to produce HCN in the temperature range of 1373–1773 K over a
Pt catalyst. The process is known as the Degussa process.99

NH3 is CH3NH2, indicating that the –NH2 group can be intro-
duced into the methane molecule as well.100 Moreover, CH4 can
also react with concentrated HNO3 to produce CH3NO2 at 573–
823 K but the yield was below 20%.
While most of the reactions for methane functionalization
were performed in the gas phase, eﬀorts have also been devoted
to the activation of methane in liquid solution because liquid
phase methane activation normally occurs at lower reaction
temperature and with higher selectivity toward the desired
product. Substantial progress has been made recently with the
nding that Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-Silicalite-1 can catalyze the
oxidation of methane to methanol in the liquid phase with H2O2
as oxidant. The highest conversion of methane was about 10%
at 323 K.101 The addition of Cu as a promoter suppressed the
over-oxidation of methanol, and the selectivity to methanol
reached 90%. This result is the highest activity obtained to date
in the oxidation of methane to methanol. Fe in the extra-
framework positions of the zeolites was proposed to be the
active species.101 Further study showed that the catalytic activity
of these catalysts can be further enhanced by introducing other
trivalent cations (e.g., Al3+, Ga3+) into the framework to stabilize
the active Fe species.102 Moreover, Fe-Silicalite-1 is also a stable
catalyst for at least 5 cycles.103 This research highlighted the
recent interest in using zeolites with strong solid acidity for the
activation of methane.
In another system, CH4 can also react with H2 and O2 to give
methanol over a Au–Pd/TiO2 catalyst. H2O2 formed in situ was
proposed to be the actual oxidant for this reaction. However,
although a relatively high selectivity was reported, the overall
yield of methanol was very low.104 The reaction was considered
to proceed through a radical process, and methyl hydroperoxide
may be a key intermediate, as evidenced by the existence of
cCH3 and cOH radicals in the reaction.
Methane can be converted to CH3COOH, CH3OH and
HCOOH in the presence of CO and O2 by using RhCl3 as the
catalyst at 453 K in the aqueous phase although with very low
methane conversion.105 Other metal chlorides (e.g., FeCl3,
CoCl2, PdCl2) are also active in oxidizing methane to C1
oxygenates with the oxidant of H2O2. OsCl3 was found to be
particularly active, giving 12 h1 methane TOF (turnover
frequency) and a remarkably high selectivity to C1 oxygenates
(61%). Os(IV) was proposed to account for the activation of H2O2
to form the active oxygen species and the subsequent oxidation
reaction.106 Another important progress is the use of Pd and Co
salts to oxidize methane to CF3COOCH3, which is a methanol
derivative, in the CF3COOH phase.107,108 CF3COOH is essential
in the reactions since it captures the activated methyl groups
and protects CF3COOCH3 from over-oxidation. Moreover, CaCl2
can catalyze the reaction of CH4 and CO to CH3COOH with
K2S2O8 as oxidant in CF3COOH solution, and CH3COOH was
observed to be the only product with a yield of 11%. For the
formation of CH3COOH, the carbon of the methyl group was
from the CH4 and the carbon of COOH was from the CO, as
evidenced by the 13C labeled experiments.109 The reaction was
believed to proceed through the radical mechanism.
Periana et al. reported a series of methane activation
processes with considerably higher conversions and yields in
oleum, as shown in Table 2. In oleum, Hg(SO4)2 catalyzed the
methane to react with H2SO4 to form CH3OSO4OH, which is a
methanol derivative. However, high concentrations of CH3O-
SO4H cannot be achieved due to the inhibition by other reaction
products such as water and methanol.110 It was also found that
the reaction between CH4 with H2SO4 can produce methyl
bisulfate at 493 K over the catalyst of (bipyrimidine)PtCl2, giving
90% methane conversion and 81% selectivity to the desired
product.111 These stable and highly eﬃcient catalytic systems
are known as Periana systems or Periana catalysts.112 Further-
more, Au, I and Pd cations were developed to catalyze methane
conversion.113–115 The reaction mechanism is illustrated in
Fig. 6. The Pt-catalyzed methane activation process is an elec-
trophilic C–H bond activation process. The methane reversibly
forms the PtII–CH3 species on the Pt complex, and then the PtII–
CH3 species are oxidized by H2SO4 to PtIV–CH3. Aer the
reductive functionalization, CH3OSO4H and PtII are generated.
A strong acidic environment is essential for maintaining the
activity of the strong nucleophilic metal center in the Periana
system. The products of water and methanol, with a much
better nucleophilic ability than methane, block the oxidation
step or compete with methane to block the methane activation
step.116 Based on the knowledge of Periana systems, some
research studies were performed to simulate the structure of the
Pt coordinated catalyst. N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), a ligand
similar to bipyrimidine, was used to catalyze the activation of
methane. The Pd(II) NHC complex was proved to be active in
oxidizing methane to CF3COOCH4 in CF3COOH solution with
K2S2O8 as oxidant.117 Graphitic carbon nitride is based on a
covalent triazine framework. Its numerous bipyrimidine struc-
tures can coordinate to Pt to form a catalyst that functions
similar to the Periana catalyst.118 These studies demonstrated
that a wide range of transition metal catalysts with versatile
ligands can be designed for methane conversion, although
strong acidic media are used, relatively low methane conversion
and expensive catalyst make the system diﬃcult for industrial
applications.

Outlook for the future
This mini-review introduced diverse types of methane trans-
formation processes that have been developed in the last few
decades. The progress made is impressive, but an eﬃcient, mild

and well-controlled process for the direct conversion of
methane in an economically attractive way remains a signicant
challenge for academia and industry in the goal of methane
utilization to its full potential. The core of the art is to gain
mechanistic insights into C–H bond activation over diﬀerent
catalysts. As more strategies are developed to perform C–H
bond scission and subsequent substitution of functional groups
or C–C bond coupling, a coherent picture of how the nature of
the reaction environment aﬀects the methane conversion and
the desired product formation would emerge. Once the
processes and factors controlling the activity and selectivity of
catalytic methane activation are understood, it is anticipated
that strategy designs, already demonstrated on a laboratory
scale, can, if appropriately adapted and improved, lead to
benign industrial methane utilization.
Although
methane
activation
has
been
extensively
researched for many decades, there is still an immediate need
for scientists to explore new possibilities of methane chemistry,
especially with the rapid development of shale gas as an avail-
able source of methane. Researchers in fundamental studies
and reaction engineering have to be brought together. Here are
a few research directions for methane conversion where we
expect signicant progress in the foreseeable future.
(1) In the vast majority of cases, a variety of oxidants have
been used for the transformation of methane. In addition to the
traditional oxygen, there are several mild oxidants such as H2O2
and halogens employed in the transformation of methane.
However, few have found a signicant impact on the industrial
scale. Many of the oxidants, such as sulfur which is a “so”
oxidant, are candidates for future methane chemistry, yet their
performances are largely unexplored.43 We suggest that other
mild oxidants similar to S2 should be studied for methane
activation and to see the controlled oxidative conversion of
methane in a latest review by Hermans et al.8
(2) The presence of the oxidant is not a prerequisite for C–H
bond activation, as proved by methane aromatization on Mo/
zeolite catalysts. Non-oxidative routes should be carefully
investigated both at low and high reaction temperatures. We
anticipate that non-oxidative methane coupling to C2 and other
hydrocarbons will be a promising research eld in the near
future. On nishing this review, a breakthrough in non-oxida-
tive conversion of methane was reported by Bao et al.121 At a
signicantly high temperature (1363 K) on a highly dispersed
iron/silica catalyst, methane was converted to ethylene with a
selectivity of 48.4% while the conversion of methane was at
48.1%, and the rest of the products were aromatics and
hydrogen. And more importantly, no coke was formed in this
non-oxidative process and no deactivation was observed for at
least 60 h. Detailed characterization of this Fe/SiO2 indicated
that Fe was well-dispersed as a single atom over the silica
support. Methane was activated by these dispersed single Fe
atoms to methyl radicals, and then these radicals coupled in the
gas phase to form ethane and in the successive dehydrogena-
tion or cyclization processes, ethylene or aromatics were
formed. We believe that, with further development, this “Bao
process” with fascinating conversion and atom-economy of
methane may greatly improve the industrial applications of
methane and relevant scientic research.

(3) Because many products, such as syngas and methanol, of
the one-step reactions discussed in this review can be further
transformed into more valuable chemicals, the combination of
methane transformation and a subsequent reaction (second
reaction) will be possible if hybrid catalysts, in which the active
components of diﬀerent catalysts are arranged in a well-
designed support system, are designed. In this case, the second
reaction provides a thermodynamic driving force so that the
rst one-step methane route with a negative free energy can
proceed. However, how to eﬃciently match the reaction
parameter as well as how to eﬀectively couple mass transport
and heat transfer will have a signicant impact on these types of
combination reactions.
(4) The methane cross-coupling reaction discussed in
Section 4.3 is of particular interest due to its various possible
products. The direct addition of a methyl group from methane
onto an organic substrate, such as ethylene and benzene, is of
great industrial value.
(5) “Co-renery” of oil/gas or coal/gas. Methane can be
considered a hydrogen donor for important energy-related
reactions such as the transformation of coal in one step and the
hydrocracking of oil.119,120 As the dissociation of the C–H bond
in methane occurs at 400–800 K on a metal catalyst, this
temperature range is suitable for the hydrocracking reaction as
well as the direct hydrogenation of coal to value-added prod-
ucts. Clearly, new catalysts and the related reaction engineering
should be carefully strategized for the so-called “co-renery”
processes of oil/gas or coal/gas feeds. The concept can be
extended to other systems where hydrogen is important in the
catalytic transformation.
(6) The activation of methane by a photocatalyst is worth
trying. With solar energy as the most abundant energy source in
nature and methane as the rising clean fossil fuel, how to
successfully couple these two forms of energy is an interesting
but
challenging
topic
for
scientists
as
well
as
energy
policymakers.
