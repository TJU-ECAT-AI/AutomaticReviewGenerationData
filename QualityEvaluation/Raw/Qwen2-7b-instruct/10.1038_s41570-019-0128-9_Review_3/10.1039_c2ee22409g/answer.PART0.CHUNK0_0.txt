[1] "The utilization of CO2 globally is envi- sioned by scientists as a necessity that could contribute not only to the mitigation of CO2 atmospheric levels, but also towards the economic, renewable and environmentally friendly synthesis of value added products."

[2] "This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Downloaded by Laurentian University on 02/04/2013 06:05:09."
[3] "The high selectivity of styrene in this selective dehydrogenation process suggests that a $2.7 million saving for 0.6 Mt of styrene monomer per year could be made."

[4] "The promotional effects have been demonstrated by Samsung General Co. at the bench-scale in the oxidation of alkyl aromatics, hydrocarbons and partially oxidized aromatics to acids using (CoMnBr) MC-type catalysts with/or without alkali or alkaline earth metals in the co-presence of CO2."

[5] "The process can be run by the direct utilization of CO2, which may be obtained as by- product from petrochemical oxidation or the reforming industry."
