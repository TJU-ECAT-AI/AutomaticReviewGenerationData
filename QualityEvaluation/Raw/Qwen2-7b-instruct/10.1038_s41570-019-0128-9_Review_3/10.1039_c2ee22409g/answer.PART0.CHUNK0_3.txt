What are the differences in catalytic performance between FeNaZ and Fe3O4 catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene using carbon dioxide?

</questions>

<quotes>
These differences in catalytic performance shed light on the behavioural aspects of carbon dioxide and its activation, the surface properties of the catalyst, the role of supports, the importance of surface oxygen species and the distinct mecha- nistic pathways that form the basis of the evolution of the reaction, which are important in the utilization of carbon dioxide in oxidation reactions.

The FeNaZ catalyst, which consists of zeolite-supported iron oxide, exhibits superior conversions compared to a simple dehydrogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere when used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene. The product analysis during the reaction reveals the occurrence of water, CO and H2 in addition to styrene. The occurrence of H2 was found to be 1/4 of the CO produced, implying that the reaction proceeded by an oxidative pathway leading to the dissociation of CO2 molecules into CO and surface oxygen, which could abstract hydrogen to form water.

在乙基苯乙烯氧化脱氢到苯乙烯时，FeNaZ催化剂（由沸石支持的铁氧化物）表现出优于仅在氮气气氛下进行简单脱氢的转化率。反应过程中产物分析显示除苯乙烯外还存在水、CO和H2。产生的H2量是CO的四分之一，这表明反应通过氧化途径进行，导致二氧化碳分子分解为CO和表面氧，这些氧可以抽象氢形成水。

The analysis revealed that the FeNaZ catalyst possesses a well dispersed meta-stable Fe3O4 phase with oxygen deficiencies, which can abstract oxygen from CO2 leading to the formation of CO. This dissociated oxygen on the catalyst surface is responsible for hydrogen abstraction from ethyl benzene,which, in turn, forms water.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The FeNaZ catalyst contains a well-dispersed metastable Fe3O4 phase with oxygen deficiencies. This allows it to abstract oxygen from CO2, forming CO. The dissociated oxygen on the catalyst surface facilitates hydrogen abstraction from ethyl benzene, leading to the formation of water.
