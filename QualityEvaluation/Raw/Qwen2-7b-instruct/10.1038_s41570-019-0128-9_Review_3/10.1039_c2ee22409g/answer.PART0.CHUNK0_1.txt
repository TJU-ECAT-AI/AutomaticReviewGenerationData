<p>Initial studies on the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide in catalytic transformations date back to the 1990s and form the basis of present day soft oxidant systems.</p>
<p>The present review paves the way for the development of alternative technologies utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter to produce chemicals.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide as a diluent in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions not only serves as an oxidant but also shows several beneficial properties in comparison with other oxidants.</p>
<p>CO2 in soft oxidant systems plays a prominent role in hydrogen abstraction from simple or functionalized hydrocarbons via the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.</p>
<p>Studies by Ge et al. with density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations on (110) and (100) surfaces of g-Al2O3 demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 occurs in a bidentate configuration across the OAl bridge sites, forming carbonate species.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was found that the promotional behaviour was due to the formation of peroxocarbonate species, which were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies under reaction conditions with and without CO2.</p>
<p>This increased conversion was attributed to the formation of peroxycarbonate species over the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was also found that, with an increase in the conversion, the side reactions also became more noticeable in the presence of carbon dioxide, which may be due to the enhanced acidity generated by the carbon dioxide molecules adsorbed on the surface of the DBH matrix.</p>
<p>The profound effect of CO2 was the suppression of the burning of p-xylene as depicted in Table 10.</p>
<p>The co-presence of CO2 augmented the conversion of cyclic olefins and a significant difference was observed in the conversion and selectivity.</p>
<p>No significant change in the catalytic performance and DC% was observed after an increment of the gas ratio beyond 0.333, indicating saturation of activity.</p>
<p>In order to get insight into the promotional aspects, the gaseous mixture from the autoclave was investigated by IR spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The process involves the use of a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst and the operation condition is 560 C. The process can be run by the direct utilization of CO2, which may be obtained as by-product from petrochemical oxidation or the reforming industry.</p>
<p>At present, most ethyl benzene dehydrogenation plants are run by a simple dehydrogenation process using a superheated steam,which leads to the loss of a large amount of latent heat upon condensation at the gasliquid separator.</p>
<p>The process is under verification through pilot-scale work so that process and engineering data necessary for industrial applications can be further collected.</p>

1. Challenges in developing catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 include overcoming the thermodynamic limitations associated with the formation of CO2 and CO by-products, while maintaining high selectivity for C2 products. Opportunities lie in the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the use of naturally available resources. Catalyst development efforts aim to optimize selectivity, efficiency, and stability.

2. In catalytic systems, CO2 acts as a promoter by influencing the kinetics, conversion, selectivity, and product distribution. Its role often involves catalytic activation, promoting oxidation reactions, and facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms. The promotional effect can be attributed to the formation of peroxocarbonate species, which mimic the activity of monoxygenases and enhance the catalytic performance.

3. The current status of utilizing CO2 in catalysis includes advancements in soft oxidant systems for oxidative dehydrogenation, oxidative coupling of methane, and oxidation of various hydrocarbons. Future perspectives involve scaling up processes, improving catalysts for enhanced CO2 conversions, minimizing coke deposition, and increasing the selectivity of desired products. The integration of CO2 utilization in existing industrial processes offers potential for energy savings and environmental benefits.
