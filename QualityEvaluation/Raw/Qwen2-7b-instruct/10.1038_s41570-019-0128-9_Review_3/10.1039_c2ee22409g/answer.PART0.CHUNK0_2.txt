[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which exhibi- ted superior conversions compared with that of a simple dehy- drogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The product analysis during the reaction revealed the occurrence of water, CO and H2 in addition to styrene; moreover the occurrence of H2 was 1/4 of the CO produced."
[2] "The present review paves the way for the development of alternative technologies utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter to produce chemicals."
[3] "The utilization of CO2 as a feedstock is a promising long term objective, which could have a small but significant positive impact on the global carbon balance."
[4] "The activity may be stable when coking and decoking reach equilibrium; this was proved by the activation of the deactivated catalyst with CO2."
[5] "All the aforementioned catalytic systems consist of transitional metal catalysts and work when CO2 is coupled with oxygen."

The comparative study by Park et al. on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene using a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst showed superior conversions compared to a simple dehydrogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The product analysis revealed the formation of water, CO, and H2 in addition to styrene, with the H2 production being 1/4 that of CO. This highlights the effectiveness of CO2 utilization in this reaction. The review outlines the potential for developing alternative technologies that leverage CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter for chemical production. The utilization of CO2 as a feedstock is seen as a promising long-term objective that could positively impact the global carbon balance. The stability of the catalyst activity upon reaching equilibrium between coking and decoking was proven by activating a deactivated catalyst with CO2. The effectiveness of CO2 in these catalytic systems is further supported by the fact that they typically consist of transition metal catalysts working in conjunction with oxygen.
