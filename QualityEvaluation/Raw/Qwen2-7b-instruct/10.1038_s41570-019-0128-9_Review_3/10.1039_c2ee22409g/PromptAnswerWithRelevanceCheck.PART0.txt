<p>Carbon dioxide as a diluent in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions not only serves as an oxidant but also shows several beneficial properties in comparison with other oxidants.</p>
<p>CO2 in soft oxidant systems plays a prominent role in hydrogen abstraction from simple or functionalized hydrocarbons via the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.</p>
<p>Studies by Ge et al. with density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations on (110) and (100) surfaces of g-Al2O3 demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 occurs in a bidentate configuration across the OAl bridge sites, forming carbonate species.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was found that the promotional behaviour was due to the formation of peroxocarbonate species, which were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies under reaction conditions with and without CO2.</p>
<p>This increased conversion was attributed to the formation of peroxycarbonate species over the catalyst surface.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was also found that, with an increase in the conversion, the side reactions also became more noticeable in the presence of carbon dioxide, which may be due to the enhanced acidity generated by the carbon dioxide molecules adsorbed on the surface of the DBH matrix.</p>

The comparative study by Park et al. on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene using a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst showed superior conversions compared to a simple dehydrogenation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The product analysis revealed the formation of water, CO, and H2 in addition to styrene, with the H2 production being 1/4 that of CO. This highlights the effectiveness of CO2 utilization in this reaction. The review outlines the potential for developing alternative technologies that leverage CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter for chemical production. The utilization of CO2 as a feedstock is seen as a promising long-term objective that could positively impact the global carbon balance. The stability of the catalyst activity upon reaching equilibrium between coking and decoking was proven by activating a deactivated catalyst with CO2. The effectiveness of CO2 in these catalytic systems is further supported by the fact that they typically consist of transition metal catalysts working in conjunction with oxygen.
