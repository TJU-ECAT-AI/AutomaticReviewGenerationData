300-500
The shift of the equilibrium state by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 has been identified from a thermodynamic analysis.17,18,19 However, the reaction systems modelled previously rarely take into consideration the competing side reactions and by-products, The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 can be significantly affected by various competing side reactions which are deleterious to the targeted C3H6 yield,selectivity and indeed to the stability of the operating catalyst.

In studying the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, thermodynamic calculations were conducted for processes operating within the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. These calculations highlighted the importance of considering competing side reactions and by-products, as they can significantly impact the yield, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst when utilizing CO2 in the reaction system. Previous models often overlooked these factors, leading to less accurate predictions of reaction outcomes.

在研究丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下脱氢时，进行了温度范围为300-500摄氏度的热力学计算。这些计算强调了考虑竞争副反应和副产品的必要性，因为它们可以显著影响目标产物C3H6的产率、选择性和催化剂的稳定性。以往的模型往往忽略了这些因素，导致对反应结果的预测不够准确。

300-500
An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range. The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in our thermodynamic modelling of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicated that neither the reverse water gas shift nor the coke gasification with CO2 are favoured at 300-500

A significant finding was the superior potential of propane (C3H8) relative to its lighter (ethane, C2H6) and heavier (butane, C4H10) isomers in terms of CO2 activation and coking resistance throughout the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. In our thermodynamic modeling of the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, the Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) for each reaction confirmed that neither the reverse water gas shift nor CO2-assisted coke formation are favored at these temperatures.

一个重要的发现是，在300-500摄氏度的温度范围内，丙烷（C3H8）相对于其较轻（乙烷，C2H6）和较重（丁烷，C4H10）同系物在CO2活化和结焦抵抗方面的潜力巨大。在我们对丙烷与CO2脱氢的热力学建模中，各反应的吉布斯自由能（ΔG）证实了，在这些温度下，既不发生逆向水煤气变换也不发生CO2辅助结焦都是不利的。

The stability test of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was operated in an M-R-10A micro-reactor (KUNLUN YONGTAI Company, China) over the Cr-based catalyst prepared as above. All tests were operated under atmospheric pressure and 500 for 5 hours, and the C3H8/CO2 mixture, whose mole ratio was kept at C3H8/CO2 =1:2. As shown in Table 3, the conditions of tests differed from each other by two variables, the mole fractions of C3H8 (and CO2) and overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV).

The stability of the propane dehydrogenation process in the presence of CO2 was evaluated using a micro-reactor (M-R-10A, Kunlun Yongtai Co., Ltd., China) over a catalyst made from chromium (Cr) on zirconium oxide (ZrO2). All tests were conducted under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius for 5 hours. The propane/CO2 mixture maintained a mole ratio of 1:2. As detailed in Table 3, the experimental conditions varied based on two parameters: the mole fractions of propane and CO2, and the overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV).

The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of the reaction under different C3H8 partial pressures and overall GHSV are shown in Figure 7. The results reveal effective C3H8 conversions at each specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning of reactions. The results with different mole fractions of C3H8 were displayed with solid symbols and the conclusion drawn from the data in these figures is an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, but also an improvement in C3H6 selectivity.

The conversion of propane (C3H8) and the selectivity of propylene (C3H6) under varying partial pressures of propane and overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) are depicted in Figure 7. The findings demonstrate efficient propane conversions across each specified condition, whereas the selectivity for propylene initially decreases. The graphical data, represented by solid symbols, for different propane mole fractions indicate a reduction in propane conversion but an enhancement in propylene selectivity.

The XRD patterns of 5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2 before and after the catalytic tests are displayed in Figure 9, and the pattern of the ZrO2 support is also shown here as reference. The peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the 1-1-0 phase of Cr2O3 with rhombohedral crystal symmetry. No peak shift or new peaks were observed from the post-reaction catalyst, which indicated that no phase change occurred during the catalytic test. Importantly, this also matched the high stability of C3H8 conversions, as shown in Figure 7.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the 5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst before and after the catalytic tests are illustrated in Figure 9, with the ZrO2 support pattern serving as a reference. The peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the 1-1-0 phase of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) with rhombohedral crystal structure. There was no indication of phase transformation or emergence of new peaks in the post-catalyst, suggesting no phase change took place during the catalytic testing. This concurred with the high stability of propane conversions, as depicted in Figure 7.

Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) results and the corresponding derivative weight-to-temperature (D-TGA) plots are displayed in Figure 10. The weight loss starting from 200°C we attribute to the combustion of amorphous carbon in air. The integrated area of the derivative weight equals to the weight loss, which displayed more coke formed with an increase of the C3H8 fractional GHSV.
