[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "Importantly, the results highlight the enhanced potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively)."
[3] "The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in the modelled, complete reacting system of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will affect the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products."
[4] "An increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[5] "However, the observed changes of C3H6 selectivity indicate that only increasing the partial pressure of reactants can effectively inhibit the further cracking of C3H6."

The study focused on utilizing CO2 to convert hydrocarbons through dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) with the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy. Thermodynamic calculations were conducted for the process operating within a temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. The results showed that propane had enhanced potential compared to its lighter (ethane, C2H6) and heavier (butane, C4H10) homologues. The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) for each reaction in the modelled system revealed that further cracking of propylene (C3H6) could impact the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a decrease in its conversion rate but, importantly, an increase in propylene selectivity. The study found that enhancing the partial pressure of reactants was the most effective method to inhibit the further cracking of propylene.

研究关注了利用太阳能热能作为可持续能源，将二氧化碳用于烃类转化的脱氢丙烷（C3H8）过程。在300-500摄氏度的温度范围内进行了热力学计算。结果表明，丙烷相对于其较轻的同系物（乙烷，C2H6）和较重的同系物（丁烷，C4H10）具有增强的潜力。模型系统中每个反应的吉布斯自由能（ΔG）显示，丙烯（C3H6）进一步裂解会影响最终产物的最终产量和选择性。提高丙烷的分压导致其转化率降低，但显著提高了丙烯的选择性。研究发现，增加反应物的分压是有效抑制丙烯进一步裂解的最有效方法。
