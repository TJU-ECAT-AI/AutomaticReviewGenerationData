[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[2] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 can be significantly affected by various competing side reactions which are deleterious to the targeted C3H6 yield, selectivity and indeed to the stability of the operating catalyst."
[4] "The C3H8 conversion is observed to be significantly affected by the partial pressure of C3H8 within the temperature range of 300-500."
[5] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."

The study focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). It explores the potential of C3H8 over its lighter (C2H6) and heavier (C4H10) homologues for CO2 utilization due to its advantageous characteristics in terms of CO2 activation and coking resistance. The research identifies that the conversion of propane is significantly influenced by its partial pressure and suggests that enhancing the selectivity of the desired product, C3H6, can be achieved by increasing the partial pressure of propane, albeit at the cost of propane conversion. The study also highlights the importance of considering competing side reactions and by-products in the dehydrogenation process, which can impact the yield and selectivity of the final products.

研究主要关注在二氧化碳（CO2）的存在下，丙烷（C3H8）的脱氢化反应作为CO2利用的潜在途径。研究发现，与较轻（C2H6）和较重（C4H10）的同系物相比，C3H8在CO2激活和结焦抵抗方面的优势使其成为CO2利用的理想选择。研究结果表明，丙烷的转化受到其分压的影响，并指出通过增加丙烷的分压可以有效提高目标产物丙烯（C3H6）的选择性，尽管这可能导致丙烷转化率的下降。此外，研究还强调了在脱氢过程中考虑竞争副反应和产物的重要性，这些副反应可能影响最终产品的产率和选择性。
