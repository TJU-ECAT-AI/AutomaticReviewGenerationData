The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a promising catalytic route for propylene (C3H6) production. This study highlights the enhanced potential of propane as compared to its lighter (ethane, C2H6) and heavier (butane, C4H10) homologues within the temperature range of 300-500°C. Thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that the presence of CO2 can shift the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of propane to favor the product side, and also reduce the coking effect on the catalyst. Experimental studies over 5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 500°C and atmospheric pressure revealed that an increase in propane partial pressure leads to a decrease in propane conversion but a promising enhancement in propylene selectivity. This is attributed to competitive adsorption on the catalyst between generated propylene and inactivated propane, which inhibits further cracking effects on propylene to produce by-products. Increasing the overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) can also decrease propane conversion to a similar extent, but the further cracking of propylene cannot be limited due to the shortened contact time of propane molecules on the catalyst surface.

在300-500°C的温度范围内，丙烷在二氧化碳（CO2）的存在下的脱氢化是丙烯（C3H6）生产的有吸引力的催化途径。这项研究表明，与较轻（乙烷，C2H6）和较重（丁烷，C4H10）同系物相比，丙烷具有更高的潜力。热力学计算表明，二氧化碳的存在可以将脱氢化丙烷的平衡转移到产物一侧，并减少催化剂上的结焦效果。实验研究发现，在500°C和大气压下使用5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂时，增加丙烷分压导致丙烷转化率下降但丙烯选择性增强。这是由于生成的丙烯和失活的丙烷在催化剂上的竞争吸附，抑制了丙烯进一步裂解产生副产品的效果。增加总体气相小时空间速度（GHSV）可以同样程度地降低丙烷转化率，但由于缩短了丙烷分子在催化剂表面的接触时间，丙烯的进一步裂解无法受到限制。

The shift of the equilibrium state by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 has been identified from a thermodynamic analysis.17,18,19 However, the reaction systems modelled previously rarely take into consideration the competing side reactions and by-products, The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 can be significantly affected by various competing side reactions which are deleterious to the targeted C3H6 yield,selectivity and indeed to the stability of the operating catalyst.

In studying the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, thermodynamic calculations were conducted for processes operating within the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. These calculations highlighted the importance of considering competing side reactions and by-products, as they can significantly impact the yield, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst when utilizing CO2 in the reaction system.

An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range. The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in our thermodynamic modelling of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicated that neither the reverse water gas shift nor the coke gasification with CO2 are favoured at 300-500

A significant finding was the superior potential of propane (C3H8) relative to its lighter (ethane, C2H6) and heavier (butane, C4H10) isomers in terms of CO2 activation and coking resistance throughout the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. In our thermodynamic modeling of the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, the Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) for each reaction confirmed that neither the reverse water gas shift nor CO2-assisted coke formation are favored at these temperatures.

The XRD patterns of 5wt%-Cr2O3/ZrO2 before and after the catalytic tests are displayed in Figure 9, and the pattern of the ZrO2 support is also shown here as reference. The peak at 2θ=36.18 corresponds to the 1-1-0 phase of Cr2O3 with rhombohedral crystal symmetry. No peak shift or new peaks were observed from the post-reaction catalyst, which indicated that no phase change occurred during the catalytic test. Importantly, this also matched the high stability of C3H8 conversions, as shown in Figure 7.

The dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide is considered a promising method for CO2 utilization due to its attractiveness in producing propylene. Increasing the propane partial pressure leads to a decrease in propane conversion but simultaneously enhances propylene selectivity. Various competing side reactions negatively impact the yield and selectivity of the final products, as well as the catalyst's stability. The availability of active sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for the reaction system. Thermodynamically, the process of dehydrogenating propane in the presence of CO2 becomes more favorable at higher alkane homologous series members. In order to fully comprehend the thermodynamic fundamentals of this process, the standard change of reaction in Gibbs free energy for the dehydrogenation of propane and other C2-C4 alkanes using CO2 was calculated within the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius, aligning with the typical solar thermal energy application conditions.
