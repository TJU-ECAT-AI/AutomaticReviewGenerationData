[1] "The RhrC catalysts were tested in gas phase ethene hydroformylation reaction to elucidate the effect of support characteristics and pretreatments on hydroformylation activity."
[2] "After hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon supported catalysts under study had different extents of reduction 6294% and dispersion 427% but all catalysts were nevertheless active in hydroformylation."
[3] "The best selectivity towards the desired product, propanal, was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst. The propanalrethane molar ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which is a surprisingly high selectivity for a nonmodified Rh catalyst under these conditions."
[4] "In the absence of pretreatment, the performance of RhrC C was superior to its hydrogen treated counterpart. Most likely, the rhodium species on the RhrC C catalyst remained more well dispersed in the absence of pretreatment than in conjunction with hydrogen reduction since the undesired Rh catalysed hydrogasification of the C C support was eliminated."
[5] "After high temperature CO pretreatment, the catalyst surface was partially blocked by carbonaceous residues, which improved the selectivity towards propanal formation, but suppressed the overall activity."

1. The RhrC catalysts were evaluated in the gas phase ethene hydroformylation process to understand how the properties of the support and the pretreatments affect hydroformylation activity.

2. Following hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon-supported catalysts displayed varying degrees of reduction (62-94%) and dispersion (42-7%). Despite these differences, they all retained activity in the hydroformylation process.

3. The coconut shell-based RhrC C catalyst demonstrated the highest selectivity for the desired product, propanal. Its propanal:ethane molar ratio reached 1.1, an unusually high selectivity for a non-modified Rh catalyst under these conditions.

4. Without pretreatment, the performance of the RhrC C catalyst surpassed that of its hydrogen-reduced counterpart. This outcome suggests that the rhodium species on the RhrC C catalyst were better dispersed in the absence of pretreatment, which helped eliminate unwanted Rh catalysis-induced hydrogasification of the C C support.

5. High temperature CO pretreatment led to a partial blocking of the catalyst surface with carbon residues, enhancing the selectivity for propanal formation but diminishing overall activity.

1.X公司测试了RhrC催化剂在气相乙烯氢甲酰化反应中的性能，以了解支撑特性和预处理对氢甲酰化活性的影响。

2. 在氢还原后，三种活性碳支持催化剂的减少程度（62-94%）和分散度（42-7%）存在差异，但它们都保持了在氢甲酰化过程中的活性。

3. 理壳基RhrC C催化剂表现出最高的产品选择性，即对目标产物丙酮的高选择性。其丙酮：乙烷摩尔比达到了1.1，这是在这些条件下非修饰Rh催化剂的异常高选择性。

4. 在没有预处理的情况下，RhrC C催化剂的性能优于其氢处理后的版本。这表明，在没有预处理的情况下，RhrC C催化剂上的铑物种更分散，有助于消除由C C支持引起的不希望的Rh催化诱导的氢气化。

5. 高温CO预处理导致催化剂表面部分被碳残留物堵塞，提高了丙酮形成的选择性，但降低了总体活性。
