[1] "The RhrC catalysts were tested in gas phase ethene hydroformylation reaction to elucidate the effect of support characteristics and pretreatments on hydroformylation activity."
[2] "After hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon supported catalysts under study had different extents of reduction 6294% and dispersion 427%."
[3] "The best selectivity towards the desired product, propanal, was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst. The propanal-rethane molar ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which is a surprisingly high selectivity for a nonmodified Rh catalyst under these conditions."
[4] "In the absence of pretreatment, the performance of RhrC C was superior to its hydrogen treated counterpart."
[5] "After high temperature CO pretreatment, the catalyst surface was partially blocked by carbonaceous residues, which improved the selectivity towards propanal formation, but suppressed the overall activity."

1. The RhrC catalysts were evaluated in a gas phase ethene hydroformylation process to understand how the properties of the support and pretreatment methods impact hydroformylation activity.
2. The three active carbon-supported catalysts displayed different levels of reduction (62-94%) and dispersion (42-7%) following hydrogen reduction.
3. The coconut shell-based RhrC C catalyst provided the highest selectivity for propanal production, achieving a propanal-to-ethane molar ratio of 1.1, which is notably high for a non-modified Rh catalyst under these conditions.
4. Without pretreatment, the RhrC C catalyst demonstrated superior performance compared to its hydrogen-reduced counterpart. This is likely due to the preservation of better dispersion of rhodium species, which was compromised during hydrogen reduction, particularly because the undesired Rh-catalyzed hydrogasification of the C C support was mitigated.
5. High-temperature CO pretreatment led to a partial blockage of the catalyst surface by carbon residues, enhancing the selectivity for propanal formation while reducing overall activity.

1. The RhrC catalysts were evaluated in the gas phase ethene hydroformylation process to understand how the properties of the support and the pretreatments affect hydroformylation activity.

2. Following hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon-supported catalysts displayed varying degrees of reduction (62-94%) and dispersion (42-7%). Despite these differences, they all retained activity in the hydroformylation process.

3. The coconut shell-based RhrC C catalyst demonstrated the highest selectivity for the desired product, propanal. Its propanal:ethane molar ratio reached 1.1, an unusually high selectivity for a non-modified Rh catalyst under these conditions.

4. Without pretreatment, the performance of the RhrC C catalyst surpassed that of its hydrogen-reduced counterpart. This outcome suggests that the rhodium species on the RhrC C catalyst were better dispersed in the absence of pretreatment, which helped eliminate unwanted Rh catalysis-induced hydrogasification of the C C support.

5. High temperature CO pretreatment led to a partial blocking of the catalyst surface with carbon residues, enhancing the selectivity for propanal formation but diminishing overall activity.
