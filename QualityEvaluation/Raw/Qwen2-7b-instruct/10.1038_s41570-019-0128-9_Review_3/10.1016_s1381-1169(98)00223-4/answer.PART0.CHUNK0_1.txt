[1] "The RhrC catalysts were tested in gas phase ethene hydroformylation reaction to elucidate the effect of support characteristics and pretreatments on hydroformylation activity."
[2] "After hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon supported catalysts under study had different extents of reduction 6294% and dispersion 427%."
[3] "The best selectivity towards the desired product, propanal, was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst. The propanalrethane molar ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which is a surprisingly high selectivity for a nonmodified Rh catalyst under these conditions."
[4] "In the absence of pretreatment, the performance of RhrC C was superior to its hydrogen treated counterpart. Most likely, the rhodium species on the RhrC C catalyst remained more well dispersed in the absence of pretreatment than in conjunction with hydrogen reduction since the undesired Rh catalysed hydrogasification of the C C support was eliminated."
[5] "After high temperature CO pretreatment 4008C, the catalyst surface was partially blocked by carbonaceous residues, which improved the selectivity towards propanal formation, but suppressed the overall activity."

1. The RhrC catalysts were evaluated in a gas phase ethene hydroformylation process to understand how the properties of the support and pretreatment methods impact hydroformylation activity.
2. The three active carbon-supported catalysts displayed different levels of reduction (62-94%) and dispersion (42-7%) following hydrogen reduction.
3. The coconut shell-based RhrC C catalyst provided the highest selectivity for propanal production, achieving a propanal-to-ethane molar ratio of 1.1, which is notably high for a non-modified Rh catalyst under these conditions.
4. Without pretreatment, the RhrC C catalyst demonstrated superior performance compared to its hydrogen-reduced counterpart. This is likely due to the preservation of better dispersion of rhodium species, which was compromised during hydrogen reduction, particularly because the undesired Rh-catalyzed hydrogasification of the C C support was mitigated.
5. High-temperature CO pretreatment led to a partial blockage of the catalyst surface by carbon residues, enhancing the selectivity for propanal formation while reducing overall activity.

1. RhrC催化剂在气相乙烷氢甲酰化过程中被测试，以阐明支撑特性和预处理方法对氢甲酰化活性的影响。
2. 在氢还原后，三种活性碳支持催化剂的还原度（62-94%）和分散度（42-7%）存在差异。
3. 球壳基RhrC C催化剂提供了最高的选择性产物丙醛，丙醛与乙烷的摩尔比为1.1，在非改性的铑催化剂下，这是令人惊讶的高选择性。
4. 在没有预处理的情况下，RhrC C催化剂的性能优于其氢还原后的同类。这可能是因为在缺乏预处理的情况下，铑物种保持了更好的分散性，而氢还原时由于不希望的Rh催化的碳支持水解导致了分散度的下降。
5. 高温CO预处理导致催化剂表面部分被碳残留物阻塞，提高了丙醛形成的选择性，但降低了整体活性。
