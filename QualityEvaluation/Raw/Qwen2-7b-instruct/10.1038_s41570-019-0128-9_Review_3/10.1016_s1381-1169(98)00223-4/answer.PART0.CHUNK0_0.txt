[1] "The RhrC catalysts were tested in gas phase ethene hydroformylation reaction to elucidate the effect of support characteristics and pretreatments on hydroformylation activity."
[2] "After hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon supported catalysts under study had different extents of reduction 6294% and dispersion 427%."
[3] "The best selectivity towards the desired product, propanal, was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst. The propanal-rethane molar ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which is a surprisingly high selectivity for a nonmodified Rh catalyst under these conditions."
[4] "In the absence of pretreatment, the performance of RhrC C was superior to its hydrogen treated counterpart."
[5] "After high temperature CO pretreatment, the catalyst surface was partially blocked by carbonaceous residues, which improved the selectivity towards propanal formation, but suppressed the overall activity."

1. The RhrC catalysts were evaluated in the gas phase ethene hydroformylation process to investigate how the properties of the support material and the pretreatment methods affect hydroformylation efficiency.
2. Following hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon-supported catalysts displayed varying degrees of reduction (62-94%) and dispersion (42-7%).
3. The coconut shell-based RhrC C catalyst demonstrated the highest selectivity for the desired product, propanal, with a propanal-to-ethane molar ratio of 1.1, a notably high selectivity for a non-modified Rh catalyst under these conditions.
4. Without pretreatment, the performance of the RhrC C catalyst was superior to its counterpart that underwent hydrogen reduction.
5. High-temperature CO pretreatment led to a partial blocking of the catalyst surface by carbon deposits, enhancing the selectivity for propanal formation while reducing overall activity.

1. 对于RhrC催化剂，通过气相乙烯氢甲酰化反应进行了测试，以探讨支持材料特性和预处理方法对氢甲酰化活性的影响。
2. 在氢还原后，三种活性碳支撑催化剂的还原度范围为62%-94%，分散度为42%-7%。
3. 椰壳基RhrC C 催化剂在选择性方面表现出最佳性能，对于目标产物丙酮，其与乙烷的摩尔比达到1.1，这是非改性的铑催化剂在这种条件下极高的选择性。
4. 未进行预处理的情况下，RhrC C 催化剂的表现优于经过氢处理的同类催化剂。
5. 高温CO预处理导致催化剂表面部分被碳沉积物堵塞，提高了丙酮形成的选择性，但降低了总体活性。
