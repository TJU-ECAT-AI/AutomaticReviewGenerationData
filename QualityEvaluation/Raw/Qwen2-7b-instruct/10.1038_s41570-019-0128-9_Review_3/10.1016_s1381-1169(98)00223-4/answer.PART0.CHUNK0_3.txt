[1] "The activity, selectivity and stability of RhrC catalysts prepared from nitrate precursor on three different active carbon supports was determined in ethene hydroformylation."
[2] "The best activity and selectivity in the formation of propanal was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst, presumably due to the better metal dispersion and the presence of unreduced Rh sites."
[3] "Furthermore, without any pretreatment, the RhrC C catalyst exhibited even higher activity and better propanal yields than its hydrogen treated counterpart."
[4] "High temperature CO pretreatment partially blocked the catalyst surface with carbonaceous residues, which improved propanal selectivity, but suppressed the overall activity."
[5] "It should also be noted that the catalysts lost 1030% of the metal deposited on the support during 24 h on stream."

1. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of RhrC catalysts on three distinct active carbon supports in ethene hydroformylation.
2. The RhrC C catalyst, derived from coconut shell, demonstrated the highest activity and selectivity for propanal formation due to its superior metal dispersion and presence of unreduced Rh sites.
3. The RhrC C catalyst showed enhanced activity and propanal yields when used without hydrogen pretreatment, suggesting better dispersion of metal particles.
4. High temperature CO pretreatment led to a partial blocking of the catalyst surface with carbon residues, which improved propanal selectivity but diminished overall activity.
5. During the hydroformylation process, the catalysts experienced a loss of metal deposition, ranging from 10% to 30% over a 24-hour period on-stream.

1. 研究旨在评估三种不同活性碳支持下制备的RhrC催化剂在乙炔氢甲酰化中的性能。
2. 从椰壳提取的RhrC C催化剂由于其优越的金属分散性和存在的未还原Rh位点，在形成丙醛方面表现出最高活性和选择性。
3. RhrC C催化剂在未经氢预处理的情况下显示出更高的活性和丙醛产率，暗示其金属颗粒分散性更好。
4. 高温CO预处理导致催化剂表面部分被碳残留物阻塞，提高了丙醛的选择性但降低了整体活性。
5. 在氢甲酰化过程中，催化剂经历了金属沉积量的损失，范围从10%到30%，持续24小时。
