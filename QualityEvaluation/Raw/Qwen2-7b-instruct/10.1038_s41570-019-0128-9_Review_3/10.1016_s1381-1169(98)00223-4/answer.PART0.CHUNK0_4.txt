[1] "After hydrogen reduction, the three active carbon supported catalysts under study had different extents of reduction 6294% and dispersion 427%."
[2] "The best selectivity towards the desired product, propanal, was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst."
[3] "In the absence of pretreatment, the performance of RhrC C was superior to its hydrogen treated counterpart."
[4] "After high temperature CO pretreatment, the catalyst surface was partially blocked by carbonaceous residues, which improved the selectivity towards propanal formation, but suppressed the overall activity."
[5] "In summary, the support characteristics and the different pretreatments had an influence on the dispersion and the extent of reduction, and thereby on the activity and selectivity of the catalysts."

1. The three active carbon-supported catalysts had varying extents of reduction ranging from 62% to 94% and dispersion levels from 42% to 7% after hydrogen reduction. 

2. The coconut shell-based RhrC C catalyst provided the highest selectivity for propanal formation among the tested catalysts.

3. Without any pretreatment, the RhrC C catalyst demonstrated superior performance compared to its counterpart after hydrogen reduction. 

4. High-temperature CO pretreatment led to a partial blocking of the catalyst surface with carbonaceous residues, enhancing the selectivity for propanal formation but reducing overall activity. 

5. The effectiveness of the catalysts was influenced by the properties of the active carbon supports and the type of pretreatment applied, impacting dispersion, reduction extent, activity, and selectivity.

1. 研究的三种活性碳支持催化剂在氢还原后，其还原度范围为62%至94%，分散度范围为42%至7%。

2. 具有椰壳基质的RhrC C催化剂在所有测试催化剂中显示出对丙醛形成的最佳选择性。

3. 在没有预处理的情况下，RhrC C催化剂的性能优于其氢还原后的对应物。

4. 高温CO预处理导致催化剂表面部分被碳质残余物堵塞，提高了丙醛形成的选择性，但降低了整体活性。

5. 催化剂的有效性受到活性碳支持物特性和预处理类型的影响，影响分散度、还原程度、活性和选择性。
