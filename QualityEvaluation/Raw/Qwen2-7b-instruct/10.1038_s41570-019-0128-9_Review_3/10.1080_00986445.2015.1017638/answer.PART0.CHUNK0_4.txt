[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. Inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to a significant increase in propane conversion and a decrease in propylene selectivity, as these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction.
2. According to thermodynamic considerations, propane equilibrium conversions are higher in the presence of CO2 compared to an inert gas or hydrogen, with a preference for the twostep pathway over the onestep pathway.
3. Experimental propane dehydrogenation conversion levels for both one-step and two-step processes are notably lower than those predicted by equilibrium theory, likely due to rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation.
4. Increased temperatures boost the product selectivity towards CO and hydrogen, specifically enhancing the propane dry reforming reaction.
5. Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce the propensity for coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts that effectively control unwanted side reactions through kinetic means.

1. 在热力学模拟中加入副反应，可以显著提高丙烷的转化率并降低丙烯的选择性，因为这些副反应在热力学上比主反应更为有利。
2. 根据热力学考虑，丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下的平衡转化率高于惰性气体或氢气，更倾向于两步路径而不是一步路径。
3. 实验数据表明，单步和双步丙烷脱氢化过程的转化率远低于均衡理论预测值，这可能归因于催化剂快速失活导致的焦炭形成。
4. 提高温度能增加CO和氢的选择性，特别是促进丙烷干重整反应。
5. 更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比降低了焦炭生成倾向和丙烯产量，除非催化剂能通过动力学控制有效控制不希望发生的副反应。
