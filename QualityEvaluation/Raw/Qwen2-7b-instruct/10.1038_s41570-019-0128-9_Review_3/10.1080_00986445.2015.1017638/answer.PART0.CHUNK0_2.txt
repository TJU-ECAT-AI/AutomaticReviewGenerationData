[1] "The results indicate that under typical CO2PDH conditions, propane dry reforming is thermodynamically much more favored, making the product distribution unfavorable."
[2] "Consequently, much is to be done to achieve active and coke resistant catalysts to make use of the advantages of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[3] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibit distinct properties in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates enhanced selectivity and stability, whereas Ni3Pt1/CeO2 showcases superior performance in terms of efficiency and synergistic effects. Experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies reveal that these catalysts enable environmentally benign catalysis, facilitating global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Notably, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 excels in CO2-ODH, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 performs exceptionally well in DRP. The synergy between nickel and platinum in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 enhances its catalytic activity and stability, contributing to its superior performance in reducing CO2 emissions.
