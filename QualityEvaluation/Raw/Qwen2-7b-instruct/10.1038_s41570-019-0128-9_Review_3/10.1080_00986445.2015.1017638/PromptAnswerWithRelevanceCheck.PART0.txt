[1] "The main carbon-containing product is coke, the extent of which decreases with increasing temperature."
[2] "The main carbon-containing product is coke over most of the range."
[3] "At very low CO2 mole fractions, the main reaction is propane pyrolysis."
[4] "Upon increasing yCO2, the selectivity to both H2 and coke (as well as their equilibrium mole fraction) decreases."
[5] "Water and CO mole fractions pass peaks at yCO2 of ca. 0.7 and 0.9, respectively."
[6] "At very high CO2 concentrations, the mole fractions of H2O, H2 and coke become identical but smaller than that of CO indicating that when propane content in the initial feed mixture approaches zero the overall reaction stoichiometry is approximated by the following reaction"

The document provides extensive insight into the thermodynamic analysis of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide, considering different reaction networks and side reactions. It discusses the influence of CO2/C3H8 molar ratio, temperature, and pressure on equilibrium conversion and product composition. It highlights that the presence of CO2 can lower the temperature required for achieving certain conversion levels compared to dehydrogenation in the presence of steam or simple dehydrogenation. The study also points out that the occurrence of side reactions, particularly propane reforming and coke formation, can significantly impact the equilibrium product composition. It suggests that coke formation reduces catalyst activity and lifetime, emphasizing the critical role of catalysts in controlling side reactions for successful CO2PDH implementation. The document compares equilibrium compositions obtained in the presence of side reactions with practical systems, indicating discrepancies between experimental data and equilibrium predictions due to rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation. It concludes that much work is needed to develop more efficient catalysts to realize the environmentally favorable process of CO2PDH, considering the challenges posed by side reactions and catalyst deactivation.
