[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[3] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to increased propane conversion and decreased propylene selectivity because these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction.
2. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that propane conversions are higher when carbon dioxide (CO2) is present compared to an inert gas or hydrogen, with a two-step process being more effective than a one-step process.
3. Experimental results for one and two-step propane dehydrogenation show much lower conversion levels than equilibrium predictions, likely due to rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation.
4. Raising temperatures enhances the selectivity of the product to carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen, which signifies an increase in propane dry reforming.
5. Increasing temperatures and the CO2/C3H8 ratio can reduce the tendency of coke formation and propylene yield, except when catalysts control unwanted side reactions kinetically.

1. 在热力学模拟中包含副反应会增加丙烷转化率并降低丙烯选择性，因为这些副反应在热力学上比主反应更有利。
2. 热力学分析表明，在存在二氧化碳（CO2）的情况下，丙烷转化率更高，与惰性气体或氢气相比，两步过程的效果更好于一步过程。
3. 实验数据显示，一和两步丙烷脱氢化过程的转化率远低于平衡预测值，这可能归因于催化剂快速由焦炭降解导致的活性丧失。
4. 提高温度增强了CO和氢的选择性作为产物，这意味着丙烷干重整的增加。
5. 增加温度和CO2/C3H8比可以减少焦炭形成倾向和丙二醇产量，除非催化剂控制了动力学上的不利副反应。
