[1] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[2] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. The equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than when using an inert gas or hydrogen. In a two-step process, the conversion is greater than in a one-step process.
2. Experimental conversion levels for one and two-step propane dehydrogenation are significantly lower than theoretical equilibrium values, suggesting rapid catalyst deactivation.
3. Including side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to increased propane conversion and decreased propylene selectivity, as these reactions are thermodynamically more favorable.
4. Increasing temperatures enhance the selectivity of CO and hydrogen, indicating that propane undergoes dry reforming.
5. Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios decrease the tendency of coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts controlling unwanted side reactions kinetically.

1. 在存在CO2的情况下，丙烷的平衡转化率高于使用惰性气体或氢气的情况。两步过程的转化率大于一步过程。
2. 实验得到的一和两步丙烷脱氢化转化率远低于理论平衡值，这可能是由于催化剂快速失活导致的。
3. 将副反应包括在热力学模拟中可以显著增加丙烷的转化率并降低丙烯的选择性，因为这些反应从热力学角度来看更为有利。
4. 提高温度增强了CO和氢的产物选择性，表明丙烷发生了干重整。
5. 更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除了控制非期望副反应的催化剂，它们在动力学上是有效的。
