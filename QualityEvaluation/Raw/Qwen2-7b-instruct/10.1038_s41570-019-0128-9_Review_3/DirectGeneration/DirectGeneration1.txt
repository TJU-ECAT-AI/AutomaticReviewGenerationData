In an extensive comparative analysis, researchers have delved into the performance, mechanisms, and characteristics of bimetallic catalysts in the carbon dioxide oxygenate to hydrocarbons (CO2-ODH) and decarboxylation reactions of propane (DRP), specifically examining the efficacy of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts. This experimental and theoretical investigation aimed to unravel the underlying factors influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity of these materials under various reaction conditions. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable efficiency in CO2-ODH reactions, showcasing a superior ability to convert CO2 into valuable hydrocarbons due to the synergistic effect between iron and nickel, which facilitates efficient CO2 activation and hydrogenation. Meanwhile, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 system was found to excel in DRP reactions, effectively converting propane into higher hydrocarbons through its enhanced capability to break chemical bonds within propane molecules, thanks to the synergistic interaction between nickel and platinum.

Theoretical studies further elucidated the electronic structure and surface chemistry of these catalysts, providing insights into their active sites and reaction pathways. It was observed that the bimetallic nature of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 enabled a more stable and active surface for both CO2-ODH and DRP processes, compared to their monometallic counterparts. This stability is crucial for industrial applications, as it ensures consistent performance over extended periods, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

Moreover, the analysis revealed that the addition of ceria (CeO2) as a support material plays a pivotal role in enhancing the thermal and mechanical stability of these catalysts, as well as improving their oxygen storage capacity, which is essential for efficient CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. The ceria also acts as a promoter, facilitating the redox reactions necessary for these catalytic transformations.

In conclusion, the comparative study of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions highlights their distinct advantages and unique mechanisms of action. These findings contribute significantly to the development of sustainable and efficient methods for carbon capture and utilization, offering promising avenues for the chemical industry to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.
