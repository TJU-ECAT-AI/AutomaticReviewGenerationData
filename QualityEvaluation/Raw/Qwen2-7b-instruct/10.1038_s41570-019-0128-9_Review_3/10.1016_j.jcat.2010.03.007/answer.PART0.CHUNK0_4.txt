The study discusses the use of binary In2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) in the presence of CO2. Different compositions were observed to exhibit synergistic effects on the catalytic performance. X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed significant modifications in the surface properties and bulk dispersion of the In2O3 phase upon the combination of the two components. The creation of surface metallic indium species during the reaction was found to be crucial for the dehydrogenation performance. The CO2's promoting effect on the yield of propylene was attributed to its facilitation of simple dehydrogenation coupled with the reverse water gas shift reaction. The study also highlights the importance of maintaining optimal surface concentrations of catalytically active metallic indium species for efficient propane dehydrogenation.
