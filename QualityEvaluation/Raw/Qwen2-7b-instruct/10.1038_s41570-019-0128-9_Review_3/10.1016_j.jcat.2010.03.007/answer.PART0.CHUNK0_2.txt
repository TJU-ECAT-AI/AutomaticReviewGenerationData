[1] "An alternative to this process is the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane by molecular oxygen [10,11], which has attracted increasing attention due to its higher efficiency of using light alkane resource with minimum energy consumption when compared to the conventional direct dehydrogenation."
[2] "Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process, carbon dioxide can act as a diluent [27], which delivers the required heat and reduces coking of catalyst by coke gasification."
[3] "Our results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "In continuation of our interest in exploring the applications of mixed oxides containing group III elements (Al, Ga and In) in propane dehydrogenation [25,26], herein, we report for the first time the use of InAl mixed oxide as a new efficient catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene."
[5] "The TPR results were obtained on a homemade apparatus loaded with 20 mg of catalyst. The samples were pretreated in flowing nitrogen at 773 K for 1 h. After cooled to room temperature, the samples were subsequently contacted with an H2/Ar mixture (H2/Ar molar ratio of 5/95 and a total flow of 40 mL min1) and heated at a rate of 5 K min1, to a final temperature of 1073 K."
[6] "The conversion and selectivity were calculated as follows: C3H8 conversion = C3H8in - C3H8out / C3H8in × 100%, C3H6 selectivity = C3H6out / (C3H6out + C3H8out) × 100%."
[7] "A temperature-programmed CO2H2 test was carried out to investigate the activity of the InAl mixed oxide catalysts for the RWGS reaction."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using molecular oxygen has gained increasing attention because it offers higher efficiency in utilizing light alkane resources with minimal energy consumption compared to conventional direct dehydrogenation processes. Carbon dioxide can function as a diluent in the dehydrogenation process, providing the necessary heat and reducing catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation.

2. The creation and maintenance of metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration on the catalyst surface are essential for achieving an efficient propane dehydrogenation process.

3. The research team reports the utilization of InAl mixed oxide as a novel and efficient catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene, marking the first instance of its application in this context.

4. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were conducted on the catalyst samples. These tests involved pretreating the samples in flowing nitrogen at 773 K for 1 hour, followed by cooling to room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were exposed to a hydrogen-aromatic mixture (H2/Ar molar ratio of 5/95 and a total flow rate of 40 mL/min) at a heating rate of 5 K/min up to 1073 K.

5. The conversion and selectivity of the propane dehydrogenation reaction were quantified using specific formulas: conversion = (initial propane input - final propane output) / initial propane input × 100%, and selectivity for propylene = final propylene output / (final propylene output + final propane output) × 100%.

6. A temperature-programmed CO2H2 test was executed to evaluate the activity of the InAl mixed oxide catalysts in the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

2. 在催化剂表面保持金属铟物种的生成和维持在最佳浓度对于实现高效的丙烷脱氢过程至关重要。

3. 研究团队首次报告了使用InAl混合氧化物作为新的高效催化剂用于丙烷脱氢制备丙烯的应用。

4. 温度程序化还原（TPR）实验对催化剂样品进行了执行。这些测试包括将样品在773 K下以流动氮气预处理1小时，然后冷却至室温。随后，样品暴露于氢芳香族混合物（H2/Ar摩尔比为5/95和总流量为40 mL/min）中，在5 K/min的加热速率下加热至1073 K。

5. 丙烷脱氢反应的转化率和选择性是通过特定公式量化：转化率 = （初始丙烷输入 - 最终丙烷输出）/ 初始丙烷输入 × 100%，丙烯选择性 = 最终丙烯输出 / （最终丙烯输出 + 最终丙烷输出）× 100%。
