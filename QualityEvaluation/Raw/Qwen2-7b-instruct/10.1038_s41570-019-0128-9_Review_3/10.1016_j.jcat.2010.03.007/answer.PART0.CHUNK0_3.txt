[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane, however, is an equilibrium-limited and endothermic reaction [6,7]."
[2] "Moreover, in the dehydrogenation process, carbon dioxide can act as a diluent [27], which delivers the required heat and reduces coking of catalyst by coke gasification."
[3] "Very recently, we have demonstrated that Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides are highly active and stable catalysts for PDH in the presence of CO2 [25,26]."
[4] "Our results have shown that the creation and maintenance of the catalytically active metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration is indispensable for an efficient dehydrogenation of propane."

The dehydrogenation of propane is an equilibrium-limited and endothermic reaction. Carbon dioxide acts as a diluent in the dehydrogenation process, delivering heat and reducing catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Recent demonstrations have shown that Ga2O3Al2O3 mixed oxides are highly active and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The efficient dehydrogenation of propane depends on the creation and maintenance of metallic indium species in optimal surface concentration.

丙烷脱氢反应是一个平衡限制和吸热反应。二氧化碳在脱氢过程中作为稀释剂发挥作用，提供热量并减少催化剂因焦炭形成而失活。最近的研究表明，Ga2O3Al2O3混合氧化物是丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下高效稳定的催化剂。高效的脱氢取决于在最佳表面浓度下创造和维持金属铟物种。
