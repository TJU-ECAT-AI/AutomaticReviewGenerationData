This is the case of the insertion of CO2 into MAO bond of metal- hydroxo (LnMAOH) and metal alkoxo (LnMAOR) complexes. The insertion reaction of CO2 into a covalent polar MAOH bond affords a hydrogen carbonate species (Eq. (26)) that can be stable or can react further. This reaction is strictly related to the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3 and the elusive acid H2CO3, a transformation that plays a key role in the respiratory process of humans and animals. The Zn-enzyme Carbonic Anhy- drase (CA) can accelerate the reaction of hydration-dehydration of CO2, facilitating, thus, CO2 up-take at cellular level and elimina- tion in lungs from where it is expulsed [86].

The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial inter- est as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides.

The insertion of CO2 into the MAN bond of metalAamido complexes (LnMANR2) generates a new CAN bond and affords metalAcarbamato complexes, which are important intermediates in the synthesis LnMANR2  CO2 ! LnMAO2CNR2 28 of carbamate esters, isocyanates, amides [34,35,92].

The CO2 insertion into a MAH or MAR bond can occur according to two different modes, which are usually designated as normal and abnormal mode (Scheme 5) [54,95,96].

The literature discusses the insertion of CO2 into different types of metal complexes including MAO, MAOR, MANR2, and MAH/MAR bonds. The process is crucial for the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3, facilitating the respiratory process in humans and animals. The enzyme Carbonic Anhydase accelerates the hydration-dehydration of CO2, aiding in CO2 uptake and elimination. Industrially, CO2 insertion into M-OR bonds leads to the synthesis of organic carbonates and polycarbonates. Additionally, CO2 insertion into MANR2 bonds forms metal carbamato complexes, essential for the synthesis of carbamate esters, isocyanates, and amides. The insertion of CO2 into MAH or MAR bonds can occur through normal or abnormal modes, with the former yielding metal formates or carboxylates and the latter generating metalla-carboxylic acids or esters.

文献讨论了CO2插入到不同类型的金属复合物中，包括MAO、MAOR、MANR2和MAH/MAR键。这一过程对于将CO2转化为带负电或配合态的HCO3至关重要，促进了人类和动物的呼吸过程。碳酰胺酶加速了CO2的水化脱水，帮助了CO2的摄取和肺部排出。工业上，CO2插入到M-OR键中导致有机碳酸盐和聚碳酸盐的合成。此外，CO2插入到MANR2键中形成了金属碳酰胺化合物，这对于羧酸酯、异氰酸酯和酰胺的合成至关重要。COH或MAR键的插入可以通过正常或异常模式发生，前者产生金属碳酸盐或羧酸，后者产生金属羧酸或酯。
