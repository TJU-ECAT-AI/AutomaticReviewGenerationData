1.Nowadays, new synthetic strategies have given new impulse to the research in this area opening new perspectives in the use of the heterocumulene as carboxylating agent of unsaturated organic substrates. These approaches exploit the reactivity of a suitable co-reagent able to reduce back the catalyst from Ni(II) to Ni(0).

<p>For instance, in the presence of Ni(0), switching from PPh3 to less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 ancillary ligand allowed to obtain 2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene and CO2 even catalytically, albeit in low yield and with a low turn- over (TON = 29).</p>
