[1] "The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial interest as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides."
[2] "The insertion of CO2 into the MAN bond of metalAamido complexes (LnMANR2) generates a new CAN bond and affords metalAcarbamato complexes, which are important intermediates in the synthesis LnMANR2  CO2 ! LnMAO2CNR2 28 of carbamate esters, isocyanates, amides [34,35,92]."
[3] "The CO2 insertion into a MAH or MAC bond can occur according to two different modes, which are usually designated as normal and abnormal mode (Scheme 5) [54,95,96]."
[4] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[5] "The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by transition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty years."
[6] "Under the latter conditions the actual substrate is HCO3 or CO3 2 rather than CO2."
[7] "The synthesis of acrylic acid based on the direct combination of ethene with CO2 (Eq. (38)) is, in principle, a very attractive alternative as it is 100% atom economical as all the atoms of the reactants are found in the target product."
[8] "A question may come to the mind of the reader: can CO2 be co-polymerized with olefins to afford polyesters (Eq. (39))? If one considers the skeleton of the product (A) obtained by coupling an olefin with CO2 (Scheme 11), under which circumstances would it be possible to insert an olefin molecule into the MAO bond of (A), followed by another CO2 molecule and so on?"

1. The insertion of CO2 into a MAO bond of metal-alkoxy (LnMAOR) complexes leads to the formation of a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety, which is industrially significant for the synthesis of organic carbonates and polycarbonates.
2. The insertion of CO2 into the MAN bond of metalamido complexes (LnMANR2) results in the formation of metal-acetamido complexes, serving as crucial intermediates in the synthesis of carbamate esters, isocyanates, and amides.
3. CO2 insertion into a MAH or MAC bond can occur in two distinct modes, referred to as normal and abnormal, as depicted in Scheme 5.
4. There is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the entire mechanism of CO2 insertion processes.
5. The direct synthesis of formic acid from CO2 and H2 using transition metal systems has been extensively studied over the past two decades.
6. In certain conditions, the actual substrate for the reaction is formate (HCO3) or carbonate (CO3 2) rather than CO2.
7. The direct combination of ethene with CO2 to synthesize acrylic acid is theoretically an appealing method due to its 100% atom economy.
8. The reader might wonder if CO2 can be copolymerized with olefins to create polyesters. If considering the structure of the product (A) obtained by coupling an olefin with CO2 (as shown in Scheme 11), it is unclear under which conditions an olefin molecule could be inserted into the MAO bond of (A), followed by another CO2 molecule and so on.

1. 将CO2插入金属醇氧（LnMAOR）复合物的MAO键导致形成金属烷基碳酸盐基团，这对于有机碳酸酯和聚碳酸酯的合成具有工业重要性。
2. 将CO2插入金属酰胺键（LnMANR2）产生金属酰胺酸复合物，作为合成羧酸酯、异氰酸酯和酰胺的关键中间体。
3. CO2插入到MAH或MAC键可以以两种不同的模式进行，通常称为正常和异常模式，如图5所示。
4. 对于CO2插入过程的整个机制，仍缺乏全面的理解。
5. 利用过渡金属系统直接从CO2和H2合成甲酸的方法在过去二十年中得到了广泛研究。
6. 在某些情况下，实际反应的底物是碳酸氢根（HCO3）或碳酸根（CO3 2），而不是CO2。
7. 直接将乙炔与CO2结合合成丙烯酸是一种理论上具有高原子经济性的方法。
8. 读者可能会质疑是否可以在不改变CO2的情况下，将CO2与烯烃共聚合成聚酯。如果考虑到在Scheme 11中通过与CO2耦合获得的产物（A），在什么条件下烯烃分子可以插入到（A）的MAO键中，然后是另一个CO2分子等等，这仍然是一个模糊的问题。
