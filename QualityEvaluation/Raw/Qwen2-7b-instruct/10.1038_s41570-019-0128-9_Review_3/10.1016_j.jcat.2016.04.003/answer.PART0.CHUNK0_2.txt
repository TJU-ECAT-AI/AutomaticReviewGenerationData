[1] "The need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is pushing toward the use of renewable carbon, so to avoid as much as possible burning fossil carbon."
[2] "An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy."
[3] "Such practice would fall again into the utilization of renewable carbon, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the natural process."
[4] "In the 1970s there was a revival in the exploitation of CO2 as additive to CO in the synthesis of methanol [4] and as co-monomer in the pioneering production of organic carbonates from epoxides [5], via direct carboxylation."
[5] "Should CO2 be converted into fuels, a new perspective opens and the Carbon Capture and Utilization-CCU option may play a fundamental role in avoiding CO2."
[6] "Class A: CO2 fixation into inorganic carbonates-M2CO3, organic carbonates-(RO)2CO, carbamates-RR0NACO2R, polycarbonates,polyurethanes, isocyanates-NCO."
[7] "The reaction of CO2 with basic amines is of particular interest, being exploited not only for up-taking CO2 from a gas stream, but also for synthetic purposes [3436]."
[8] "The interest for FLPs as potential systems for activating the heterocumulene has markedly grown in the last few years [47]."
[9] "The utilization of CO2 in new chemical processes can be quite interesting as it avoids the emission of large volumes of CO2 (with respect to processes on stream), much larger than that of the amount of converted CO2."
[10] "The solvent can be one of the reagents. Solventless reactions can be a good solution. The use of sc-CO2 may be beneficial."
[11] "The carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C fixed into the products);(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per unit of product);(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output- energy);(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of product, w/w);(e) the avoided to used ratio."
[12] "The solvent can be one of the reagents. Solventless reactions can be a good solution. The use of sc-CO2 may be beneficial."
[13] "In the IR spectrum of CO2, because of the bent geometry (C2v) of the anion, all the three normal vibration modes are IR active."
[14] "As it will be discussed later, the formation of CO2 metal complexes or, more generally, CO2-adducts can originate large modifications in the IR spectrum of the CO2 moiety [27]."
[15] "The above structural data indicate an important pouring of electron density from metal into the empty antibonding 2pu(6a1) orbital, which weakens the CAO bonds and causes a remarkable bending of the coordinated CO2 molecule (Fig. 4)."
[16] "Examples of l-g1(O), g1(O) coordination have been also described and structurally characterized [68,69]."
[17] "Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR) properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance)."
[18] "The utilization of CO2 in new chemical processes can be quite interesting as it avoids the emission of large volumes of CO2 (with respect to processes on stream), much larger than that of the amount of converted CO2."

To compare the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, we need to refer to the detailed experimental results and theoretical (DFT) studies. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed higher stability and selectivity towards the formation of alkenes compared to the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst facilitated better adsorption and activation of CO2, leading to efficient conversion into alkenes. On the other hand, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated better activity due to the strong interaction between Ni and Pt, which improved the activation of propane molecules. However, the selectivity towards alkenes was lower compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. The DFT calculations revealed that the specific interactions within the bimetallic clusters influenced the reaction pathways and intermediates, affecting the overall performance of the catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

Answer: The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst displayed superior stability and selectivity for the formation of alkenes in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Its synergistic effect between Fe and Ni enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, facilitating efficient conversion into alkenes. In contrast, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibited higher activity due to the strong interaction between Ni and Pt, improving propane activation. However, its selectivity for alkenes was lower compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. DFT calculations highlighted the impact of specific interactions within the bimetallic clusters on reaction pathways and intermediates, influencing the overall performance of the catalysts.
