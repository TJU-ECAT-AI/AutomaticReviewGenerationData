<p>The need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is pushing toward the use of renewable carbon, so to avoid as much as possible burning fossil carbon.</p>
<p>Biomass is synonym of renewable carbon, as it is re-generated from CO2,usually captured from atmosphere.</p>
<p>An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy.</p>

<p>CO2 properties, coordination chemistry and reactions</p>
<p>CO2 has a linear geometry (D1h) in its ground state, with both the carbonoxygen bonds being equivalent and displaying an equilibrium CAO distance of 1.1600 Å [10,11].</p>
<p>The valence electronic configuration of CO2 (16 valence electrons) in the linear ground state, 1Rg +, is 3rg 22ru 24rg 23ru 21pu 41pg 4 [12].</p>
<p>Upon addition of an extra electron the CO2 molecule converts into the radical anion CO2 (Eq. (4)).</p>
<p>Removal of a 1pg electron from CO2 molecule to afford the CO2 + radical cation in the 2Pg ground state requires an energy of 13.79 eV [18], by far larger than that needed for the formation of the radical anion CO2 [16] or for the dissociation of neutral CO2 to CO and atomic oxygen [19].</p>
<p>As it will be discussed later, the formation of CO2 metal complexes or, more generally, CO2-adducts can originate large modifications in the IR spectrum of the CO2 moiety [27].</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle ultraviolet regions, at least down to 210 nm (hm < 5.91 eV), both in the liquid phase and in the gas phase [20].</p>
<p>Only weak absorptions can be observed below 11 eV, in the vacuum ultraviolet region, at 147.5 (8.41 eV), 133.2 (9.31 eV) and 112.1 nm (11.08 eV), respectively.</p>
<p>CO2 dissolved in a nonpolar solvent (benzene, toluene) displays only one 13C NMR signal around 124 ppm. In aqueous solutions, the resonance is close to 125 ppm and can be used for the quantification of free CO2.</p>
<p>The MOs most relevant to the chemical reactivity of carbon dioxide are the doubly occupied non-bonding 1pg orbitals (HOMOs), mainly localized on the end oxygen atoms, and the empty antibonding 2pu orbitals (LUMOs), mostly centered on the carbon (Fig. 3).</p>
<p>Therefore, CO2 can be considered an amphoteric molecule, as it can act as an acceptor of electrons at the C-atom (through the LUMOs) and a donor of electrons via the O-atoms (through the HOMOs).</p>
<p>The reaction of CO2 with ionic metal hydroxides [M(OH)n] (Eq. (7)) involves the nucleophilic attack of the anion (OH) to the electrophilic carbon of CO2 [30].</p>
<p>The interest for FLPs as potential systems for activating the heterocumulene has markedly grown in the last few years [47].</p>
<p>Basic studies on this topic are welcome and new knowledge may be of fundamental importance for potential exploitation.</p>
<p>Side-on coordination represents by far the most common bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [55], the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and 1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms are bound to the nickel center, which exhibits a planar coordination.</p>
<p>In principle, side-on adducts may be considered as three-membered oxametallacycles resulting from a formal oxidative addition of one of the p-bonds of the CO2 ligand to the metal center or as p-complexes, wherein the metalCO2 interaction involves both electron donation from the O-centered 1puy(5a1) and 1pgy(4b2) orbitals of CO2 to empty d-orbitals of M and, at a greater extent, electron back-donation from a filled d-orbital of metal to the empty C-centered 2puy(6a1) orbital of the ligand [58].</p>
<p>This point is relevant to the definition of the oxidation state of the metal center M: is it zero, one or two?</p>
<p>The ability of CO2 to act as a bifunctional system is further documented by the plethora of CO2 complexes in which the cumulene bridges two or more metal centers through carbon and one or both oxygens [5254].</p>

1. The need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions pushes towards the use of renewable carbon to avoid burning fossil carbon. Biomass is a synonym for renewable carbon, as it regenerates from CO2, usually captured from the atmosphere. An advanced level of complexity would involve integrating biotechnology and catalysis for effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes or whole microorganisms, coupled with chemical technologies supplying energy to enzymes using perpetual sources like solar, wind, or geothermal as primary energy. These methods are currently under investigation with public-private investments in research. The utilization of CO2 can prevent it from reaching the atmosphere, leaving fossil carbon underground for future generations.

2. The structure of CO2 is linear with D1h symmetry, and its valence electron configuration in the ground state is 3rg 22ru 24rg 23ru 21pu 41pg 4. Adding an electron converts it into a radical anion. Removing an electron from CO2 requires 13.79 eV, significantly more than for forming the radical anion or dissociating CO2 into CO and atomic oxygen.

3. CO2 coordination affects its spectroscopic properties, including IR and NMR spectra. The formation of CO2 metal complexes leads to substantial changes in the IR spectrum of CO2. In UV light, CO2 is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle ultraviolet regions, with weak absorptions in the vacuum ultraviolet region.

4. CO2 displays amphoteric reactivity, acting as both an electron acceptor and donor. Its reactivity with anionic or neutral species like H, OH, or amines is exemplified by reactions with H, OH, and tertiary aliphatic amines. Amines can form ammonium carbamates or carbamic acids through carbamation reactions.

5. CO2 coordination with metal centers can lead to changes in its geometry, such as bending, due to electron density redistribution. This impacts the reactivity of CO2 and can lead to the formation of three-membered oxametallacycles or p-complexes.

6. The reaction of CO2 with metal hydroxides results in the nucleophilic attack of the anion on the electrophilic carbon of CO2. FLPs have attracted interest for activating CO2, potentially enabling its reduction or activation through reactions involving hydroboration or hydrosilylation.

7. Side-on coordination is the predominant mode of CO2 binding to metal centers, involving both carbon and one oxygen atom. Side-on adducts can be considered three-membered oxametallacycles or p-complexes, depending on the electron density distribution.

8. The coordination state of metal centers in CO2 complexes can vary, affecting the reactivity of CO2. For instance, g1-C coordination involves only the carbon atom, while g1-O coordination involves only the oxygen atom.

9. The interaction of CO2 with metal atoms in a gas matrix at low temperatures can lead to different behaviors depending on the metal's oxophilicity. Early transition metals may insert into one of the C@O bonds, while late transition metals typically form 1:1 M(CO2) adducts.

10. The protonation of coordinated CO2 under mild conditions affords CO as a product, utilizing the metal or an external source for electron reduction. This process is related to the dissociative reduction of CO2 to CO, which can be catalyzed at high temperatures using metal oxides.

11. The deoxygenation of CO2 can occur at room temperature with suitable metal centers and oxophiles, facilitating the splitting of CO2 into CO and O. This process can be coupled with the production of useful chemicals, such as epoxides from olefins, or can promote the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.

12. CO2 can act as a soft and selective oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, favoring milder conditions and higher selectivity compared to pure dioxygen. Its role as a soft oxidant extends to other reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons.

13. The performance of bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane can be influenced by their composition, selectivity, stability, and synergistic effects. Experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies can provide insights into their performance, potential for environmentally benign catalysis, and global alkene production.

11. CO2可以作为软且选择性的氧化剂在乙苯的脱氢作用中发挥作用，与纯氧气相比，这有利于更温和的条件和更高的选择性。CO2在其他反应中的作用包括甲烷的氧化耦合为乙烷和乙烯，以及各种烃类的氧化脱氢作用。

12. 双金属催化剂如Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的性能受到它们的组成、选择性、稳定性和协同效应的影响。实验和理论（DFT）研究可以提供有关其性能、环境友好催化潜力以及全球烯烃生产的信息。
