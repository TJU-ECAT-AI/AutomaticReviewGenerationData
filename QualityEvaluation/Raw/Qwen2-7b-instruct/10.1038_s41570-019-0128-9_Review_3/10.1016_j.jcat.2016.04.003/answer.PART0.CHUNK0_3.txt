State of the art and perspectives in catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels: The distinctive contribution of chemical catalysis and biotechnology, Michele Aresta a,b,c,, Angela Dibenedetto c,d, Eugenio Quaranta c,d a Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, National University of Singapore, Engineering Drive 4, 117585 Singapore, Singapore b David Parkin Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, UK c CIRCC, via Celso Ulpiani 27, Bari 70126, Italy d Department of Chemistry, Campus Universitario, University of Bari, 70126 Bari, Italy a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 29 September 2015 Revised 30 March 2016 Accepted 4 April 2016 Available online xxxx Keywords: CO2 properties Coordination chemistry and reactions CO2 conversion into chemicals CO2 as source of carbon for energy products Biotechnological uses of CO2 a b s t r a c t The need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is pushing toward the use of renewable carbon, so to avoid as much as possible burning fossil carbon. It would be possible to com- plement the natural carbon cycle by developing man-made industrial processes for carbon recycling,converting, thus, spent carbon as CO2 into working carbon, as that present in valuable chemicals or fuels. Such practice would fall into the utilization of renewable carbon, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the natural process. An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integra- tion of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy.

These days all the above approaches are under investigation with an interesting complementarity of public-private investment in research. This paper aimed at making the state of the art in CO2 conversion and giving a perspective on the potential of such technology. Each atom of C we can recycle is an atom of fossil carbon left in the underground for next generations that will not reach the atmosphere today.
