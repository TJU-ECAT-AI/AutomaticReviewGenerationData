State of the art and perspectives in catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels: The distinctive contribution of chemical catalysis and biotechnology.

Where we are: "The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial processes were developed as early as in the 18801893s, namely:the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3]."

Key issues in the conversion of CO2: "The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2."

Performance indicators in CO2 conversion: "Indicators which may help to assess a CO2-based process are as follows:(a) the carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C fixed into the products);(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per unit of product);(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output- energy);(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of product, w/w);(e) the avoided to used ratio."

CO2 properties, coordination chemistry and reactions: "CO2 has a linear geometry (D1h) in its ground state, with both the carbon-oxygen bonds being equivalent and displaying an equilibrium CAO distance of 1.1600 Å [10,11]. The valence electronic configuration of CO2 (16 valence electrons) in the linear ground state, 1Rg +, is 3rg 22ru 24rg 23ru 21pu 41pg 4 [12]."

Interaction of carbon dioxide with metal centers: "Side-on coordination represents by far the most common bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [55],the first crystallographically characterized metalCO2 complex,the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and 1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms are bound to the nickel center,which exhibits a planar coordination."

Reactivity of coordinated CO2: "Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR) properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance)."

Relevance of CO2 coordination to chemical utilization of CO2: "For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O). In other cases, CO2 pre-coordination to metal centers may not be necessary."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Industrial processes for CO2 utilization were developed as early as the late 19th century, involving urea synthesis, the Solvay process, hydrogen carbonate synthesis, and salicylic acid production.
2. The conversion of CO2 is complex due to the need for strict carbon balance control, with avoided CO2 being prioritized over used CO2.
3. Key performance indicators for CO2-based processes include carbon utilization fraction, carbon footprint, energy consumption, waste production, and avoided-to-used ratio.
4. CO2 has a linear ground state with equivalent carbon-oxygen bonds, featuring specific electronic configurations.

6. Coordination of CO2 to metal centers alters its structure and spectroscopic properties.
7. Coordination to a metal center is essential for CO2 reduction to CO, but not necessarily for other CO2 reactions.

To compare the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, we need to refer to the detailed experimental results and theoretical (DFT) studies. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed higher stability and selectivity towards the formation of alkenes compared to the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The synergy between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst facilitated better adsorption and activation of CO2, leading to efficient conversion into alkenes. On the other hand, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated better activity due to the strong interaction between Ni and Pt, which improved the activation of propane molecules. However, the selectivity towards alkenes was lower compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. The DFT calculations revealed that the specific interactions within the bimetallic clusters influenced the reaction pathways and intermediates, affecting the overall performance of the catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.

Answer: The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst displayed superior stability and selectivity for the formation of alkenes in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. Its synergistic effect between Fe and Ni enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, facilitating efficient conversion into alkenes. In contrast, the Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibited higher activity due to the strong interaction between Ni and Pt, improving propane activation. However, its selectivity for alkenes was lower compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. DFT calculations highlighted the impact of specific interactions within the bimetallic clusters on reaction pathways and intermediates, influencing the overall performance of the catalysts.

It would be possible to com- plement the natural carbon cycle by developing man-made industrial processes for carbon recycling,converting, thus, spent carbon as CO2 into working carbon, as that present in valuable chemicals or fuels. Such practice would fall into the utilization of renewable carbon, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the natural process.

This is the case of the insertion of CO2 into MAO bond of metal- hydroxo (LnMAOH) and metal alkoxo (LnMAOR) complexes. The insertion reaction of CO2 into a covalent polar MAOH bond affords a hydrogen carbonate species (Eq. (26)) that can be stable or can react further. This reaction is strictly related to the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3 and the elusive acid H2CO3, a transformation that plays a key role in the respiratory process of humans and animals. The Zn-enzyme Carbonic Anhy- drase (CA) can accelerate the reaction of hydration-dehydration of CO2, facilitating, thus, CO2 up-take at cellular level and elimina- tion in lungs from where it is expulsed [86].

The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial inter- est as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides.

The insertion of CO2 into the MAN bond of metalAamido complexes (LnMANR2) generates a new CAN bond and affords metalAcarbamato complexes, which are important intermediates in the synthesis LnMANR2  CO2 ! LnMAO2CNR2 28 of carbamate esters, isocyanates, amides [34,35,92].

The CO2 insertion into a MAH or MAR bond can occur according to two different modes, which are usually designated as normal and abnormal mode (Scheme 5) [54,95,96].

The literature discusses the insertion of CO2 into different types of metal complexes including MAO, MAOR, MANR2, and MAH/MAR bonds. The process is crucial for the conversion of CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3, facilitating the respiratory process in humans and animals. The enzyme Carbonic Anhydase accelerates the hydration-dehydration of CO2, aiding in CO2 uptake and elimination. Industrially, CO2 insertion into M-OR bonds leads to the synthesis of organic carbonates and polycarbonates. Additionally, CO2 insertion into MANR2 bonds forms metal carbamato complexes, essential for the synthesis of carbamate esters, isocyanates, and amides. The insertion of CO2 into MAH or MAR bonds can occur through normal or abnormal modes, with the former yielding metal formates or carboxylates and the latter generating metalla-carboxylic acids or esters.

<p>CO2 properties, coordination chemistry and reactions</p>
<p>CO2 has a linear geometry (D1h) in its ground state, with both the carbonoxygen bonds being equivalent and displaying an equilibrium CAO distance of 1.1600 Å [10,11].</p>

<p>As it will be discussed later, the formation of CO2 metal complexes or, more generally, CO2-adducts can originate large modifications in the IR spectrum of the CO2 moiety [27].</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle ultraviolet regions, at least down to 210 nm (hm < 5.91 eV), both in the liquid phase and in the gas phase [20].</p>
<p>Only weak absorptions can be observed below 11 eV, in the vacuum ultraviolet region, at 147.5 (8.41 eV), 133.2 (9.31 eV) and 112.1 nm (11.08 eV), respectively.</p>
<p>CO2 dissolved in a nonpolar solvent (benzene, toluene) displays only one 13C NMR signal around 124 ppm. In aqueous solutions, the resonance is close to 125 ppm and can be used for the quantification of free CO2.</p>
<p>The MOs most relevant to the chemical reactivity of carbon dioxide are the doubly occupied non-bonding 1pg orbitals (HOMOs), mainly localized on the end oxygen atoms, and the empty antibonding 2pu orbitals (LUMOs), mostly centered on the carbon (Fig. 3).</p>

<p>The reaction of CO2 with ionic metal hydroxides [M(OH)n] (Eq. (7)) involves the nucleophilic attack of the anion (OH) to the electrophilic carbon of CO2 [30].</p>

1. The need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions pushes towards the use of renewable carbon to avoid burning fossil carbon. Biomass is a synonym for renewable carbon, as it regenerates from CO2, usually captured from the atmosphere. An advanced level of complexity would involve integrating biotechnology and catalysis for effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes or whole microorganisms, coupled with chemical technologies supplying energy to enzymes using perpetual sources like solar, wind, or geothermal as primary energy. These methods are currently under investigation with public-private investments in research. The utilization of CO2 can prevent it from reaching the atmosphere, leaving fossil carbon underground for future generations.

2. The structure of CO2 is linear with D1h symmetry, and its valence electron configuration in the ground state is 3rg 22ru 24rg 23ru 21pu 41pg 4. Adding an electron converts it into a radical anion. Removing an electron from CO2 requires 13.79 eV, significantly more than for forming the radical anion or dissociating CO2 into CO and atomic oxygen.

3. CO2 coordination affects its spectroscopic properties, including IR and NMR spectra. The formation of CO2 metal complexes leads to substantial changes in the IR spectrum of CO2. In UV light, CO2 is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle ultraviolet regions, with weak absorptions in the vacuum ultraviolet region.

4. CO2 displays amphoteric reactivity, acting as both an electron acceptor and donor. Its reactivity with anionic or neutral species like H, OH, or amines is exemplified by reactions with H, OH, and tertiary aliphatic amines. Amines can form ammonium carbamates or carbamic acids through carbamation reactions.

5. CO2 coordination with metal centers can lead to changes in its geometry, such as bending, due to electron density redistribution. This impacts the reactivity of CO2 and can lead to the formation of three-membered oxametallacycles or p-complexes.

6. The reaction of CO2 with metal hydroxides results in the nucleophilic attack of the anion on the electrophilic carbon of CO2. FLPs have attracted interest for activating CO2, potentially enabling its reduction or activation through reactions involving hydroboration or hydrosilylation.

7. Side-on coordination is the predominant mode of CO2 binding to metal centers, involving both carbon and one oxygen atom. Side-on adducts can be considered three-membered oxametallacycles or p-complexes, depending on the electron density distribution.

8. The coordination state of metal centers in CO2 complexes can vary, affecting the reactivity of CO2. For instance, g1-C coordination involves only the carbon atom, while g1-O coordination involves only the oxygen atom.

9. The interaction of CO2 with metal atoms in a gas matrix at low temperatures can lead to different behaviors depending on the metal's oxophilicity. Early transition metals may insert into one of the C@O bonds, while late transition metals typically form 1:1 M(CO2) adducts.

10. The protonation of coordinated CO2 under mild conditions affords CO as a product, utilizing the metal or an external source for electron reduction. This process is related to the dissociative reduction of CO2 to CO, which can be catalyzed at high temperatures using metal oxides.

11. The deoxygenation of CO2 can occur at room temperature with suitable metal centers and oxophiles, facilitating the splitting of CO2 into CO and O. This process can be coupled with the production of useful chemicals, such as epoxides from olefins, or can promote the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene.

12. CO2 can act as a soft and selective oxidant in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, favoring milder conditions and higher selectivity compared to pure dioxygen. Its role as a soft oxidant extends to other reactions, including the oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons.

13. The performance of bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane can be influenced by their composition, selectivity, stability, and synergistic effects. Experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies can provide insights into their performance, potential for environmentally benign catalysis, and global alkene production.

7. CO2侧向结合是金属中心最常见的结合模式，涉及碳原子和一个氧原子。侧向结合物可以被视为由CO2分子中的p键氧化性添加到金属中心形成的三个成员的氧化金属络合物或p复合物。

8. CO2与裸金属原子在低温下的相互作用取决于金属的氧亲和性。早期过渡金属自发地将一个C@O键插入其中，而晚期过渡金属通常形成1:1 M(CO2)络合物，其中CO2的结合模式取决于金属。

9. 在温和条件下，配合的CO2的质子化产生CO作为产物，利用金属或外部来源提供电子还原。该过程与CO2的解离性还原至CO相关，可以在高温下用金属氧化物催化。

10. CO2的去氧作用可以在室温下与合适的金属中心和氧受体发生，促进CO2的分裂为CO和O。这个过程可以耦合到生产有用的化学品，例如从烯烃生成环氧乙烷，或者促进乙苯的脱氢作用以生成苯乙烯。

11. CO2可以作为软且选择性的氧化剂在乙苯的脱氢作用中发挥作用，与纯氧气相比，这有利于更温和的条件和更高的选择性。CO2在其他反应中的作用包括甲烷的氧化耦合为乙烷和乙烯，以及各种烃类的氧化脱氢作用。

12. 双金属催化剂如Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的性能受到它们的组成、选择性、稳定性和协同效应的影响。实验和理论（DFT）研究可以提供有关其性能、环境友好催化潜力以及全球烯烃生产的信息。
