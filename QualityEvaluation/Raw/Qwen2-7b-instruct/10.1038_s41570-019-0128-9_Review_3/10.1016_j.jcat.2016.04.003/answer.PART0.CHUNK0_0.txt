[1] "The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur- ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s."
[2] "An answer can be given only by mechanistic studies on reactive systems."
[3] "Any a priori attempt to foresee the behavior of reactive systems is a pure guess."
[4] "For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O)."
[5] "In other cases, CO2 pre-coordination to metal centers may not be necessary, as discussed later on."
[6] "Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that it proceeds instead through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordination to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond of the newly formed, reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex."
[7] "Interestingly, using the (PPh3)3RhCl(O2) complex and labeled O2 and CO2 species (16O2, 18O2, 16O2 12C, 18O2 12C, 16O2 13C) it has been confirmed using FTIR and NMR studies that the formation of the peroxocarbonate moiety occurs via CO2 insertion into the OAO bond more than into the RhAO bond of the dioxygen-Rh complex."

The comparison between the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane is lacking in the provided literature. The document focuses on CO2 coordination and its implications for the conversion of CO2 into various chemical products rather than comparing specific catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. It does not provide details on the composition, selectivity, stability, or mechanisms of these catalysts in the specified reactions. Insights into their performance, synergistic effects, and potential for environmentally benign catalysis cannot be drawn from the text. Further experimental and theoretical studies are required to address these comparisons.

关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2这两种双金属催化剂在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的比较，在提供的文献中没有提供。该文档主要关注CO2的协调及其将CO2转化为各种化学产品的过程，而不是比较这些催化剂在指定反应中的性能。它没有提供有关这两种催化剂在特定反应中的组成、选择性、稳定性和机制的详细信息。从文本中无法得出这些催化剂的性能、协同效应以及环境友好催化潜力的见解。需要进一步的实验和理论研究来解决这些比较问题。
