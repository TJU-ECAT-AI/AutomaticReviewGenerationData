State of the art and perspectives in catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels: The distinctive contribution of chemical catalysis and biotechnology.

Where we are: "The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial processes were developed as early as in the 18801893s, namely:the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3]."

Key issues in the conversion of CO2: "The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2."

Performance indicators in CO2 conversion: "Indicators which may help to assess a CO2-based process are as follows:(a) the carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C fixed into the products);(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per unit of product);(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output- energy);(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of product, w/w);(e) the avoided to used ratio."

CO2 properties, coordination chemistry and reactions: "CO2 has a linear geometry (D1h) in its ground state, with both the carbon-oxygen bonds being equivalent and displaying an equilibrium CAO distance of 1.1600 Å [10,11]. The valence electronic configuration of CO2 (16 valence electrons) in the linear ground state, 1Rg +, is 3rg 22ru 24rg 23ru 21pu 41pg 4 [12]."

Interaction of carbon dioxide with metal centers: "Side-on coordination represents by far the most common bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [55],the first crystallographically characterized metalCO2 complex,the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and 1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms are bound to the nickel center,which exhibits a planar coordination."

Reactivity of coordinated CO2: "Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR) properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance)."

Relevance of CO2 coordination to chemical utilization of CO2: "For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation at O). In other cases, CO2 pre-coordination to metal centers may not be necessary."
