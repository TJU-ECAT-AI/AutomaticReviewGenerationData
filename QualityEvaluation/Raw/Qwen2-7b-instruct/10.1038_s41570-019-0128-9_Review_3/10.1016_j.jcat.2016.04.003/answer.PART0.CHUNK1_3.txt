[1] "The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial interest as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides."
[2] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[3] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[4] "In the following sections special attention will be devoted to compounds such as carboxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates, isocyanates, ureas, carbonates, due to their industrial importance."
[5] "The synthesis of acrylic acid based on the direct combination of ethene with CO2 (Eq. (38)) is, in principle, a very attractive alternative as it is 100% atom economical as all the atoms of the reactants are found in the target product."
[6] "The synthesis of acrylic acid or its derivatives is a key step in the production of a wide range of consumer products, including acrylic esters, resins, and polymers used in coatings and adhesives."
[7] "A growing use of acrylic acid Group 1 metal derivatives is in the production of supersorbent polymers."
[8] "Various metallorganic reagents, usually obtained by the direct metalation of a CAH bond (as well as by reacting an organic halide with a metal compound), have been used for a stoichiometric carboxylation of organic substrates."
[9] "The direct carboxylation reactions are of great importance, and their exploitation may have favorable impact on the chemical industry allowing the synthesis of several large market products (for instance, acetic acid, benzoic acid, long chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids) through less tortuous and more C-efficient routes."
[10] "Also this industrial synthesis is not a catalytic process as 1 mol of Group 1 metal (Na or K) is used per mol of phenol."

1. The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (alkyl or aryl) bonds results in the formation of a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety, which is industrially valuable for synthesizing molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates from alcohols, polyols, and epoxides.

2. The insertion mode of CO2 depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (hydrogen or carbon), which can be significantly influenced by the metal's properties and ancillary ligands.

3. There is still a need for a comprehensive understanding and explanation of the observed insertion processes.

4. Special focus is given to compounds like carboxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates, isocyanates, ureas, and carbonates, due to their industrial significance.

5. Directly combining ethene with CO2 for the synthesis of acrylic acid is a promising method that conserves all the reactant atoms in the target product, offering 100% atom economy.

6. Acrylic acid or its derivatives play a crucial role in the manufacturing of products such as acrylic esters, resins, and polymers utilized in coatings and adhesives.

7. Acrylic acid derivatives, particularly those derived from Group 1 metals, are increasingly used in the production of superabsorbent polymers.

8. Metallorganic reagents, often obtained through direct metalation of a CAH bond or reaction with organic halides and metal compounds, have been employed in stoichiometric carboxylation reactions for organic substrates.

9. Direct carboxylation reactions hold great importance and promise to revolutionize the chemical industry by enabling the synthesis of key products like acetic acid, benzoic acid, long-chain fatty acids, and dicarboxylic acids with greater efficiency and less environmental impact.

10. The industrial process for synthesizing phenol-based compounds typically uses 1 mole of a Group 1 metal (like sodium or potassium) per mole of phenol, which indicates a non-catalytic process.

11. The use of 1 mole of Group 1 metal per mole of phenol in industrial synthesis indicates a lack of catalytic process for producing phenol-based compounds.
