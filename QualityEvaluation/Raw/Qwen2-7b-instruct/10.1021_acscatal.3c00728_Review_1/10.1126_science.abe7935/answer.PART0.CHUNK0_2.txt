[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days."
[3] "By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[4] "BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure."
[5] "The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst-1 h-1) of 3600 L kg-1 h-1."
[6] "Figure 1A shows the dependence of propane conversion on reaction temperature over various catalysts."
[7] "The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature."
[8] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560°C, respectively."
[9] "Fig. 1B shows the dependences of olefin selectivity on propane conversion over BS-1."
[10] "Olefin selectivity as a function of the propane conversion is shown in Fig. 1B and fig. S8."
[11] "The BS-1 catalyst exhibited propene and ethene selectivities (based on carbon atoms) of 60.9 and 25.7% at a low propane conversion of 5.3%, giving an overoxidized propane selectivity of <0.5%."
[12] "This excellent selectivity was mostly maintained with raising the propane conversion."
[13] "The hexagonal carbon nitride (h-BN) catalyst, which has been regarded as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, showed slightly lower olefin selectivity (79.9%) under the comparable propane conversion (40.2%; fig. S8)."
[14] "Because of this reaction trend, the olefin formation rate over the BS-1 catalyst was much higher than that of the h-BN and B/S-1 catalysts (fig. S10)."
[15] "Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."
[16] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."
[17] "In addition, the structure of BS-1 was investigated using gas-phase cluster analysis from the solid structure, which is bombarded from the catalyst and randomly formed to contain compositional and structural information."
[18] "Time-of-flight mass spectra (ToF-MS) showed different gas-phase clusters from the BS-1 (with metallic Cu as sample support), where the boron-containing clusters of BO2 and BO3 and a variety of borosilicate ions [SizB1OyHx, z = 1, 2] were detected."
[19] "The clusters containing the BOB structure (e.g., B2OxHy) were completely undetectable (figs. S26, S28, and S29)."
[20] "These data also suggest isolated boron in the BS-1, in good agreement with the NMR results."
[21] "Advanced 2D 1H-1H double quantum (DQ) MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to explore the proton-proton proximities in the fresh and used BS-1 catalysts (Fig. 3C)."
[22] "Compared with as-synthesized BS-1, the used sample exhibited enhanced signal intensity at (3.5, 5.6) ppm and (2.1, 5.6) ppm (Fig. 3C)."
[23] "This phenomenon is reasonably related to the further hydrolysis of SiOB bonds during the ODHP to form more spatially correlated BOH and SiOH species (e.g., isolated B[OHO(H)Si]2), which should be crucial for the high activity of BS-1 zeolite."
[24] "More importantly, SiOH nests (1.8, 3.6 ppm) and fully hydrolyzed boron species (2.9 ppm) were undetectable in the 1H-1H DQ spectrum of the fresh and used BS-1 (Fig. 3C) (33), confirming that the deep hydrolysis of SiOB species and boron leaching were effectively inhibited."

1. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly those with a 1-D edge structure, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The spatial distribution of these sites, along with their dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D), plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the catalysts. The design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications can be advanced by understanding these specific properties and mechanisms.

2. The BS-1 catalyst, characterized by a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, is reported to have high activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions due to its unique active site composition. This structure allows for efficient activation of oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation while hindering full hydrolysis of boron species, leading to excellent durability.

3. The spatial distribution of boron species within the MFI zeolite framework of BS-1 catalyst is crucial for its catalytic performance. The catalyst's structure hinders the full hydrolysis of boron species, contributing to its excellent durability and water tolerance. This unique property makes BS-1 an ideal catalyst for ODHP reactions.

4. The BS-1 catalyst's performance is influenced by its ability to maintain high activity and selectivity for propene and ethene even after extensive testing. The use of a 1-D edge active site structure in the catalyst enhances its performance in ODHP reactions, demonstrating the potential for scalable applications in industry.
