[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime."
[4] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days."
[5] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, specifically those with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. This unique structure allows for efficient activation of both molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation while hindering full boron hydrolysis. This property ensures that the catalyst maintains high activity and selectivity over extended periods, making it water-tolerant and suitable for commercial applications. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites facilitates the design of more efficient catalysts optimized for ODHP processes.
