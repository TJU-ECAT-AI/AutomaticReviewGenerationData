[1] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
[2] "Furthermore, we demonstrate an isolated boron with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite as the active center, which enables the activation of oxygen and a carbonhydrogen bond to catalyze the ODHP."
[3] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (figs. S37 and S38), giving good durability in the reaction process."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on isolated boron species within a zeolite framework, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These isolated boron species, often characterized by a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, enable the activation of both oxygen and carbon-hydrogen bonds to catalyze the ODHP process. The unique property of these sites lies in their ability to maintain high activity and selectivity while hindering full hydrolysis and dissolution, thanks to the BOSiOx linkage. This linkage ensures superior durability in long-term tests, contributing to the rational design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是聚焦于催化体系中孤立硼物种在沸石框架内的位置，对丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）过程中的催化剂性能产生了显著影响。这些孤立的硼物种通常具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，能够激活氧分子和碳-氢键，从而催化丙烷脱氢。这些活性位点的独特之处在于它们能够维持高活性和选择性，同时阻止完全水解和溶解，得益于BOSiOx键。这种键确保了在长期测试中具有出色的耐用性，支持了设计更高效催化剂以满足商业应用需求的合理策略。
