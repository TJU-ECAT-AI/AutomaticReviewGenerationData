[2] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days."
[3] "By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[4] "BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure."
[5] "The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst-1 h-1) of 3600 L kg-1 h-1."
[6] "Figure 1A shows the dependence of propane conversion on reaction temperature over various catalysts."
[7] "The BS-1 catalyst was active for the reaction, giving propane conversion with increasing reaction temperature."
[8] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560°C, respectively."
[9] "Fig. 1B shows the dependences of olefin selectivity on propane conversion over BS-1."
[10] "Olefin selectivity as a function of the propane conversion is shown in Fig. 1B and fig. S8."
[11] "The BS-1 catalyst exhibited propene and ethene selectivities (based on carbon atoms) of 60.9 and 25.7% at a low propane conversion of 5.3%, giving an overoxidized propane selectivity of <0.5%."
[12] "This excellent selectivity was mostly maintained with raising the propane conversion."
[13] "The hexagonal carbon nitride (h-BN) catalyst, which has been regarded as a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP, showed slightly lower olefin selectivity (79.9%) under the comparable propane conversion (40.2%; fig. S8)."
[14] "Because of this reaction trend, the olefin formation rate over the BS-1 catalyst was much higher than that of the h-BN and B/S-1 catalysts (fig. S10)."
[15] "Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."
[16] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."
[17] "In addition, the structure of BS-1 was investigated using gas-phase cluster analysis from the solid structure, which is bombarded from the catalyst and randomly formed to contain compositional and structural information."
[18] "Time-of-flight mass spectra (ToF-MS) showed different gas-phase clusters from the BS-1 (with metallic Cu as sample support), where the boron-containing clusters of BO2 and BO3 and a variety of borosilicate ions [SizB1OyHx, z = 1, 2] were detected."
[19] "The clusters containing the BOB structure (e.g., B2OxHy) were completely undetectable (figs. S26, S28, and S29)."
[20] "These data also suggest isolated boron in the BS-1, in good agreement with the NMR results."

[22] "Compared with as-synthesized BS-1, the used sample exhibited enhanced signal intensity at (3.5, 5.6) ppm and (2.1, 5.6) ppm (Fig. 3C)."
[23] "This phenomenon is reasonably related to the further hydrolysis of SiOB bonds during the ODHP to form more spatially correlated BOH and SiOH species (e.g., isolated B[OHO(H)Si]2), which should be crucial for the high activity of BS-1 zeolite."
[24] "More importantly, SiOH nests (1.8, 3.6 ppm) and fully hydrolyzed boron species (2.9 ppm) were undetectable in the 1H-1H DQ spectrum of the fresh and used BS-1 (Fig. 3C) (33), confirming that the deep hydrolysis of SiOB species and boron leaching were effectively inhibited."
