[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime."
[4] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180°C for 3 days."
[5] "By calcination in air to remove the organic template, BS-1 with an Si/B ratio of 62 was obtained."
[6] "For comparison, we also loaded the boron species on S-1 zeolite (B/S-1) and amorphous silica (B/SiO2) by impregnation (fig. S7), with Si/B ratios of 50 and 66, respectively."
[7] "The catalytic ODHP was performed in a fixed-bed reactor containing a feed gas of propane and oxygen (C3H8/O2/He = 1/1/8) with a weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, LC3H8 kgcatalyst-1 h-1) of 3600 L kg−1 h−1."
[8] "Figure 1A shows the dependence of propane conversion on reaction temperature over various catalysts."
[9] "For example, 23.8 and 41.4% of propane conversions were realized on the BS-1 catalyst at 540 and 560°C, respectively."
[10] "By contrast, B/S-1 and B/SiO2 catalysts exhibited lower propane conversions at 1.9 and 8.5% at 540°C, respectively."
[11] "Fig. 1B shows the dependences of olefin selectivity on propane conversion over BS-1."
[12] "Olefin selectivity as a function of the propane conversion is shown in Fig. 1B and fig. S8."
[13] "Under these reaction conditions, the one-pass yield of olefins reached 33.6% (22.7% for propene and 10.9% for ethene)."
[14] "Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."
[15] "Even after reaction for 210 hours, the catalyst still exhibited propane conversion at 43.7%, with propene and ethene selectivities at 53.3 and 29.5%, respectively, showing the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically those with isolated boron species, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The report highlights a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) that differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers. This structure allows for efficient activation of molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation while hindering full boron hydrolysis during catalysis. As a result, the BS-1 catalyst demonstrates water tolerance, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime. The catalyst's synthesis involves a solvent-free crystallization strategy followed by calcination in air to remove the organic template. The BS-1 catalyst shows superior performance in ODHP reactions compared to B/S-1 and B/SiO2 catalysts, with higher propane conversions and olefin selectivities. The catalyst's durability is also remarkable, as evidenced by its performance in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion, even after 210 hours of reaction.

在B基催化剂中，特别是孤立硼物种的空间分布和维度，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能有显著影响。这些独特性质和反应机制，尤其是聚焦于1-D边缘活性位点，为设计更高效的商用催化剂提供了机会。报告指出了一种新的活性中心——MFI沸石框架中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构（BS-1），与通常含有BOB寡聚物的催化剂不同。这种结构允许高效激活分子氧和丙烷以促进脱氢，同时阻止催化过程中硼的完全水解。因此，BS-1催化剂表现出对水的耐受性，在长时间连续测试中保持高活性和选择性。催化剂的合成涉及无溶剂结晶策略，随后在空气中煅烧去除有机模板。BS-1催化剂在ODHP反应中的表现优于B/S-1和B/SiO2催化剂，显示出更高的丙烷转化率和烯烃选择性。催化剂的耐用性也十分突出，在高丙烷转化率的连续ODHP测试中，即使经过210小时的反应，其仍能保持丙烷转化率，并且丙烯和乙烷的选择性分别达到53.3%和29.5%，展示了BS-1催化剂在ODHP过程中的良好耐用性。
