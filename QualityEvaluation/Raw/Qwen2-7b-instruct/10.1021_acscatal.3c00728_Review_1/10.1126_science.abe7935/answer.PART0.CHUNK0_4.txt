[1] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."
[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."
[3] "As a result, the BS-1 catalyst is water tolerant, maintaining high activity and selectivity in a continuous test for a long lifetime."
[4] "This feature simultaneously provided the necessary active species for the reaction and hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution."
[5] "The first-order rate dependence might suggest a different reaction behavior on BS-1 compared with the generally supported boron and h-BN."
[6] "For the catalyst with a dihydroxyl group on boron, O2 and C3H8 were initially coadsorbed on one hydroxyl group through weak van der Waals interaction (R)."
[7] "In this case, the constructed eight-member ring in the transition state by three hydrogen bonds benefits the synergistic conversion of O2 (3Σg) and propane through the decreasing of energy barriers, indicating the importance of B(OH)2 groups and the nearby silanol species."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable efficient activation of molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation while hindering full hydrolysis and dissolution of boron species. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites facilitates the rational design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Specifically, the presence of dihydroxyl boron species on the catalyst surface creates an eight-member ring in the transition state, which benefits the synergistic conversion of O2 and propane, indicating the importance of B(OH)2 groups and nearby silanol species. The first-order rate dependence observed on the BS-1 catalyst suggests a distinct reaction behavior compared to commonly supported boron and h-BN catalysts. This unique mechanism contributes to the high activity, selectivity, and water tolerance of the BS-1 catalyst, making it an ideal choice for scalable applications in ODHP reactions.

活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，在氧化脱氢反应中对B基催化剂的性能产生了显著影响。这些位点能够高效地激活分子氧和丙烷，促进脱氢作用，同时阻碍硼物种的完全水解和溶解。理解这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制为设计更高效的商用催化剂提供了机会。具体而言，催化剂表面的二羟基硼物种在反应中形成八元环过渡态，这有利于氧2（3Σg）和丙烷的协同转化，强调了B(OH)2组分和附近硅醇基的重要性。BS-1催化剂观察到的一级速率依赖性表明其与通常支持的硼和h-BN催化剂存在不同的反应行为。这一独特的机制使得BS-1催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高活性、选择性和水稳定性，是实现规模化应用的理想选择。
