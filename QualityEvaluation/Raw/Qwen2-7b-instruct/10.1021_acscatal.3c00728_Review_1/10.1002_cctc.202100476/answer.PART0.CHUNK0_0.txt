[1] "The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN."
[2] "The obtained spinning solution was ejected from the needle at a certain rate through a syringe pump. Under the action of electric field force, the charged spinning solution breaks through its surface tension to form the Taylor cone. Then, with the solvent instantly evaporated, the dried h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber was collected on the aluminum foil."
[3] "When used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."
[4] "This study shines light on the specific one-dimensional fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN as well as a new strategy of preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications relies on understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of the specific one-dimensional fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN, which leads to an increased olefins productivity compared to bulk ODHP catalysts. The new strategy of preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts involves utilizing the exfoliated h-BN to create a 1-D structure that enhances the active site exposure and facilitates easier mass transfer, thereby achieving higher catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，显著影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。设计更高效的商用催化剂依赖于理解这些独特的性质和反应机制。研究强调了一维纤维结构的重要性，该结构包含分散的h-BN，这导致了与目前报道的块状ODHP催化剂相比，更高的烯烃产率。新策略是利用剥离的h-BN来制备更高效的硼基催化剂，通过形成一维结构来增强活性位点的暴露，并促进更好的质量传递，从而在高空间速度条件下实现更高的催化效率。
