[1] "In recent years, the superior activity of h-BN in ODHP was demonstrated,2, 3, 5 which inspired a wave for the research of boron-based ODHP catalysts."
[2] "The obtained spinning solution was ejected from the needle at a certain rate through a syringe pump. Under the action of electric field force, the charged spinning solution breaks through its surface tension to form the Taylor cone. Then, with the solvent instantly evaporated, the dried h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber was collected on the aluminum foil."
[3] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."
[4] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts (Table1) used in the ODHP reaction."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly those found in 1-D structures like the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1-D edge active sites of h-BN provide a higher surface area relative to their volume compared to their 2-D and 3-D counterparts. This leads to enhanced activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites enables researchers to design more efficient catalysts with improved productivity and selectivity, surpassing traditional bulk catalysts. The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with its one-dimensional structure and even dispersion of h-BN, demonstrated an impressive olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is notably higher than other reported boron-based catalysts. This showcases the effectiveness of incorporating 1-D structures and dispersed h-BN to enhance the space utilization of h-BN and olefins productivity in future catalyst design.
