How do the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how does understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications?

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in ODHP reactions. In this study, a novel one-dimensional (1-D) h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was fabricated, demonstrating remarkable olefins productivity in ODHP of propane. The 1-D structure facilitates the active site exposure, enhancing the catalytic efficiency and conversion rate. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites, like BOH species, allows for the effective dispersion of h-BN, leading to improved space utilization and olefins productivity. This approach offers a new strategy for designing more efficient boron-based catalysts for commercial applications.
