[1] "Fabrication of h-BN/SiO2 Nanofibers Showing High Olefins Productivity in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane"
[2] "This study shines light on the specific one-dimensional fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN as well as a new strategy of preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process."
[3] "When used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, which contains dispersed h-BN in a fibrous structure, exhibits remarkable performance in ODHP reactions. It achieves a 12.4% conversion of propane, 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, and a high olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, surpassing that of bulk ODHP catalysts by more than five times.
