[1] "The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN."
[2] "The obtained spinning solution was ejected from the needle at a certain rate through a syringe pump. Under the action of electric field force, the charged spinning solution breaks through its surface tension to form the Taylor cone. Then, with the solvent instantly evaporated, the dried h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber was collected on the aluminum foil."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically the one-dimensional (1-D) edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature highlights that these 1-D edge active sites are advantageous due to their enhanced surface area and potential for easier exposure to reactants, leading to higher catalytic efficiency and productivity. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the study demonstrates that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst, with well-dispersed h-BN, exhibits better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions compared to bulk catalysts. This is attributed to the enhanced mass transfer and active site exposure enabled by the 1-D structure of the catalyst. Furthermore, the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst shows remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is notably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts used in the ODHP reaction. The findings emphasize the importance of the 1-D fibrous structure containing dispersed h-BN as a new strategy for preparing more efficient boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process.

在氧化脱氢反应中，B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是单维（1-D）边缘活性位点，在其性能方面起着关键作用。文献强调了这些1-D边缘活性位点的优势，由于它们的表面面积更大，并且有可能更易于暴露于反应物，从而导致更高的催化效率和生产力。理解这些1-D位点的独特性质和反应机制对设计用于商业应用的更高效催化剂具有重要意义。例如，研究表明，以纤维状结构分散的h-BN为特征的一维h-BN/SiO2纳米纤丝催化剂，在高空间速度条件下表现出更好的催化效率。这归因于由催化剂的1-D结构所增强的质量传递和活性位点暴露。此外，h-BN/SiO2纳米纤丝催化剂显示出令人瞩目的烯烃生产力24.9golefinsgBN1h1，这远高于批量催化剂和目前报道的大多数硼基催化剂在氧化脱氢丙烷反应中的生产力。研究结果强调了包含分散h-BN的1-D纤维结构作为制备更高效硼基催化剂的新策略在氧化脱氢丙烷过程中的重要性。
