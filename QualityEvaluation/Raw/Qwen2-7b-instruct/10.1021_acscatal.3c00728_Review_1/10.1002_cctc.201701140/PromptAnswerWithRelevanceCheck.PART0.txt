The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically referring to 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites contribute to high selectivity in the formation of olefins, with ethylene being the predominant byproduct over carbon oxides (COx). The observation that boron-containing materials, including boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), can catalyze the ODHP reaction and exhibit similar trends in product distribution highlights the uniformity of these active sites across different boride catalysts. This finding challenges previous hypotheses that edge sites on boron nitride (BN) were the active sites and instead suggests the formation of a surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts. The confirmation of an active and selective BOx site under ODHP reaction conditions implies its pivotal role in the selective reaction pathway for olefin formation. Current research efforts aim to further elucidate the effects of these active sites on reactivity, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是指1-D边缘活性位点，在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中的性能上起着关键作用。这些位点有助于高选择性地形成烯烃，乙烯是主要副产品，而不是碳氧化物（COx）。观察到硼化合物材料，包括硼碳化物（B4C）、钛硼化物（TiB2）、镍硼化物（NiB）、钴硼化物（Co2B/Co3B）、铪硼化物（HfB2）和钨硼化物（WB），都能催化ODHP反应，并且在产物分布趋势上表现出相似的趋势，这突出了这些活性位点在不同硼化物催化剂之间的统一性。这一发现反驳了以往认为硼氮化物（BN）的边缘位点是活性位点的观点，而是提出了所有测试的硼化物催化剂上形成了类似表面稳定化的BOx活性位点的可能性。确认在ODHP反应条件下存在活性和选择性的BOx位点表明它在选择性反应途径形成烯烃中的关键作用。当前的研究努力旨在进一步阐明这些活性位点对反应性的影响，可能引领更高效催化剂的开发以满足工业应用的需求。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1-D edge active sites contribute to the selectivity of the reaction. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, aids in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The performance of these catalysts is not solely determined by their surface area but also by the active-site density and electronic interactions between the surface and the bulk structure. The active sites are characterized by boronoxygen coordination, which plays a crucial role in the selective formation of olefins during the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials are likely due to variations in active-site density and electronic interactions, which can be further elucidated through ongoing research efforts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。一维边缘活性位点有助于选择性反应。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对于设计更高效的商用催化剂至关重要。这些催化剂的性能不仅取决于表面面积，还与表面和本体结构之间的活性位点密度和电子相互作用有关。活性位点通过硼氧配位被表征，这对选择性生成烯烃起着关键作用。元素硼与硼化合物材料之间的反应活性差异可能归因于活性位点密度和表面与本体结构之间电子相互作用的差异，这可以通过正在进行的研究工作进一步阐明。

B4C and WB are the most and least reactive, respectively, and they differ in their specific rates of propane consumption per gram of catalyst by a factor of approximately 5.
The rate of propane consumption does not scale with the surface area of the boron-containing catalyst.
The increased oxygen contents at the surfaces of the spent catalysts suggest that oxygen is functionalized onto the surfaces of B-containing catalysts during the ODHP reaction to form BOx active sites, which play a critical role in the ODHP reaction.
Notably, the X-ray photoelectron spectral regions of the constituent elements (i.e., C1s, Ti2p, Ni2p, N1s, Co2p, Hf4d, and W4f) do not show the same shifts toward higher binding energies upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, which suggests oxygen does not coordinate to these elements.
These data could suggest that the active sites of these B-containing catalysts might be a layer of B2O3 formed on the surface.
Our hypothesis agrees with experimental evidence provided by Huang et al., who did not observe the presence of BOH under insitu diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurement upon using hBN for the ODH of ethane.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the high reactivity and selectivity of elemental boron compared to other boride compounds suggest that the active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure play crucial roles. The hypothesis that boron oxides (BOx) form on the surface during the ODHP reaction and are responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins is supported by experimental evidence. Understanding these effects allows for the development of catalysts with optimized performance, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process for commercial applications.

[Boron and Boron-Containing Catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane]

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of small alkanes presents a potentially economically attractive method for the production of building-block olefins."

"High selectivity to propylene is achieved by using these B-containing catalysts, and the main byproduct is ethylene, rather than COx."

"Furthermore, the reactivity of elemental B far exceeds that of other boron-containing materials, and it achieves specific rates approximately 31times higher than hBN and approximately 19times higher than B4C."

"To identify structural similarities between the tested catalysts that lead to the observed activity, spectroscopic characterization was undertaken."

"Indeed, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of these B-containing compounds shows that the mass of hBN remains unchanged up to 800C under flowing air."

"Moreover, the features <190eV disappear in spent B-containing catalysts, which indicates that all of the exposed surface B atoms become coordinated to oxygen after the ODHP reaction."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically referring to 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These unique properties and reaction mechanisms allow for high selectivity in olefin formation, contributing to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Understanding the active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, enables researchers to optimize catalyst structures, enhancing reactivity and selectivity. The high selectivity to propylene achieved with boron-containing catalysts suggests that the formation of BOx active sites on the surface plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The spectroscopic characterization techniques used to study the catalysts provide insights into the surface composition changes during the reaction, supporting the hypothesis of the formation of BOx sites that are responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins. The thermogravimetric analysis of boron-containing compounds, showing that hBN remains stable up to 800°C under flowing air, highlights the exceptional resistance of hBN to oxidation, which contributes to its catalytic stability. The disappearance of certain features in the spent catalysts indicates the oxidation of boron atoms to BOx species, suggesting a direct correlation between the oxidation state of boron and the formation of active sites involved in the ODHP reaction.
