[Boron and Boron-Containing Catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane]

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of small alkanes presents a potentially economically attractive method for the production of building-block olefins."

"High selectivity to propylene is achieved by using these B-containing catalysts, and the main byproduct is ethylene, rather than COx."

"Furthermore, the reactivity of elemental B far exceeds that of other boron-containing materials, and it achieves specific rates approximately 31times higher than hBN and approximately 19times higher than B4C."

"To identify structural similarities between the tested catalysts that lead to the observed activity, spectroscopic characterization was undertaken."

"Indeed, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of these B-containing compounds shows that the mass of hBN remains unchanged up to 800C under flowing air."

"Moreover, the features <190eV disappear in spent B-containing catalysts, which indicates that all of the exposed surface B atoms become coordinated to oxygen after the ODHP reaction."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically referring to 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These unique properties and reaction mechanisms allow for high selectivity in olefin formation, contributing to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Understanding the active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, enables researchers to optimize catalyst structures, enhancing reactivity and selectivity. The high selectivity to propylene achieved with boron-containing catalysts suggests that the formation of BOx active sites on the surface plays a critical role in the ODHP reaction. The spectroscopic characterization techniques used to study the catalysts provide insights into the surface composition changes during the reaction, supporting the hypothesis of the formation of BOx sites that are responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins. The thermogravimetric analysis of boron-containing compounds, showing that hBN remains stable up to 800°C under flowing air, highlights the exceptional resistance of hBN to oxidation, which contributes to its catalytic stability. The disappearance of certain features in the spent catalysts indicates the oxidation of boron atoms to BOx species, suggesting a direct correlation between the oxidation state of boron and the formation of active sites involved in the ODHP reaction.
