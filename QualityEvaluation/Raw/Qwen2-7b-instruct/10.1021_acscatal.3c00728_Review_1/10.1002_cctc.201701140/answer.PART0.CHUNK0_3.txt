B4C and WB are the most and least reactive, respectively, and they differ in their specific rates of propane consumption per gram of catalyst by a factor of approximately 5.
The rate of propane consumption does not scale with the surface area of the boron-containing catalyst.
The increased oxygen contents at the surfaces of the spent catalysts suggest that oxygen is functionalized onto the surfaces of B-containing catalysts during the ODHP reaction to form BOx active sites, which play a critical role in the ODHP reaction.
Notably, the X-ray photoelectron spectral regions of the constituent elements (i.e., C1s, Ti2p, Ni2p, N1s, Co2p, Hf4d, and W4f) do not show the same shifts toward higher binding energies upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, which suggests oxygen does not coordinate to these elements.
These data could suggest that the active sites of these B-containing catalysts might be a layer of B2O3 formed on the surface.
Our hypothesis agrees with experimental evidence provided by Huang et al., who did not observe the presence of BOH under insitu diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurement upon using hBN for the ODH of ethane.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the high reactivity and selectivity of elemental boron compared to other boride compounds suggest that the active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure play crucial roles. The hypothesis that boron oxides (BOx) form on the surface during the ODHP reaction and are responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins is supported by experimental evidence. Understanding these effects allows for the development of catalysts with optimized performance, enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the ODHP process for commercial applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边沿活性位点，显著影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。这些位点的独特性质和反应机制为商业应用中的高效催化剂设计做出了贡献。例如，元素硼与其它硼化物化合物相比表现出的高反应性和选择性表明，表面BOx物种与亚表面晶格结构之间的活性位点密度和电子相互作用起着关键作用。形成在ODHP反应过程中表面的硼氧化物（BOx）并负责选择性反应路径形成烯烃的假设得到了实验证据的支持。理解这些效应使开发具有优化性能的催化剂成为可能，从而提高ODHP过程的效率和选择性，适用于商业应用。
