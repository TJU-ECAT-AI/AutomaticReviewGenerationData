[1] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions (Figure1)."
[2] "The rate of propane consumption does not scale with the surface area of the boron-containing catalyst (Table1), and disparities are more likely as a result of differences in the active-site densities and/or the electronic interactions between the catalyst surface and the bulk structure."
[3] "These B-containing catalysts were found to have similar surface elemental compositions, primarily composed of B and O atoms, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[4] "Boronoxygen coordination was confirmed for spent B-containing compounds from observed shifts to higher binding energies of the B1s XPS feature."
[5] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."
[6] "The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials may be owing to active-site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1-D edge active sites contribute to the selectivity of the reaction. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, aids in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The performance of these catalysts is not solely determined by their surface area but also by the active-site density and electronic interactions between the surface and the bulk structure. The active sites are characterized by boronoxygen coordination, which plays a crucial role in the selective formation of olefins during the ODHP reaction. The reactivity differences between elemental boron and boron-containing materials are likely due to variations in active-site density and electronic interactions, which can be further elucidated through ongoing research efforts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。一维边缘活性位点有助于选择性反应。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对于设计更高效的商用催化剂至关重要。这些催化剂的性能不仅取决于表面面积，还与表面和本体结构之间的活性位点密度和电子相互作用有关。活性位点通过硼氧配位被表征，这对选择性生成烯烃起着关键作用。元素硼与硼化合物材料之间的反应活性差异可能归因于活性位点密度和表面与本体结构之间电子相互作用的差异，这可以通过正在进行的研究工作进一步阐明。
