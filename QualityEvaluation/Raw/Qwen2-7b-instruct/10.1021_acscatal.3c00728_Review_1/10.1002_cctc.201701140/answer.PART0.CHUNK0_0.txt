[1] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions (Figure1)."
[2] "High selectivity to propylene is achieved by using these B-containing catalysts, and the main byproduct is ethylene, rather than COx."
[3] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."
[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."
[5] "Efforts to elucidate these effects on reactivity further are currently ongoing."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically referring to 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites contribute to high selectivity in the formation of olefins, with ethylene being the predominant byproduct over carbon oxides (COx). The observation that boron-containing materials, including boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), can catalyze the ODHP reaction and exhibit similar trends in product distribution highlights the uniformity of these active sites across different boride catalysts. This finding challenges previous hypotheses that edge sites on boron nitride (BN) were the active sites and instead suggests the formation of a surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts. The confirmation of an active and selective BOx site under ODHP reaction conditions implies its pivotal role in the selective reaction pathway for olefin formation. Current research efforts aim to further elucidate the effects of these active sites on reactivity, potentially leading to the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是指1-D边缘活性位点，在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中的性能上起着关键作用。这些位点有助于高选择性地形成烯烃，乙烯是主要副产品，而不是碳氧化物（COx）。观察到硼化合物材料，包括硼碳化物（B4C）、钛硼化物（TiB2）、镍硼化物（NiB）、钴硼化物（Co2B/Co3B）、铪硼化物（HfB2）和钨硼化物（WB），都能催化ODHP反应，并且在产物分布趋势上表现出相似的趋势，这突出了这些活性位点在不同硼化物催化剂之间的统一性。这一发现反驳了以往认为硼氮化物（BN）的边缘位点是活性位点的观点，而是提出了所有测试的硼化物催化剂上形成了类似表面稳定化的BOx活性位点的可能性。确认在ODHP反应条件下存在活性和选择性的BOx位点表明它在选择性反应途径形成烯烃中的关键作用。当前的研究努力旨在进一步阐明这些活性位点对反应性的影响，可能引领更高效催化剂的开发以满足工业应用的需求。
