[1] "Other boron-containing materials such as boron carbide, titanium boride, nickel boride, cobalt boride, hafnium boride, and tungsten boride, as well as elemental boron itself, show the same exceptional behavior as boron nitride."
[2] "High selectivity to propylene is achieved by using these B-containing catalysts, and the main byproduct is ethylene, rather than COx."
[3] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),7 n-butane, and isobutane8 to form the corresponding olefins selectively."
[4] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the elemental surface compositions of the fresh and spent catalysts (TableS2 in the Supporting Information)."
[5] "The strong catalytic stability of hBN was already evidenced in separate studies, and it showed stable propane conversion for 3days7 and 13days on stream.9 Here, we additionally report that B4C shows a stable propylene yield for approximately 2days on stream after an initial induction period during the first day on stream (FigureS3)."

How do the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how does understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications?
