The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in their performance during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reactions. This is because different dimensions (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) affect the reactivity and efficiency of the catalysts. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites exhibit unique properties and reaction mechanisms that contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts suitable for commercial applications.
