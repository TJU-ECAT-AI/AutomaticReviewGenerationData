The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, including 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D configurations, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for practical use.
