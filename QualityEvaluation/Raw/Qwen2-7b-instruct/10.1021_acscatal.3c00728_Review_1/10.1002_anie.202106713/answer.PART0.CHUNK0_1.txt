"N2-BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 76.7% selectivity toward propylene or 89.4% for all olefins were achieved at 520C."
"Three new diffraction peaks at 2θ=14.6 and 27.8, and 37.7 appeared in the O2-BN pattern, proving that O2 plasma treatment introduced a considerable amount of new species to h-BN."
"FT-IR spectra of catalysts were given in Figure3a. Prior to the treatment of plasma, the spectrum of BN exhibited the characteristic in-plane B-N transverse stretching vibration at 1385cm1 and out-of-plane bending vibration at 803cm1, respectively."
"Interestingly, peaks ascribed to the N-H and B-H vibration were also found after the ODH reaction."
"To deeply elucidate the characteristics of oxygen-containing boron species, the acidity of fresh and spent catalysts was investigated by the mean of NH3-TPD for the first time (Figure5; TableS5)."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. N2 plasma treatment on h-BN creates more three-boron center nitrogen-defects, which are considered advantageous for generating active species. This leads to enhanced activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Oxygen-containing boron species are introduced during O2 plasma treatment, which affects the catalyst's activity. The acidity of fresh and spent catalysts is investigated to understand the differences between new oxygen-containing boron species and B2O3, providing insights into the catalyst's performance.
