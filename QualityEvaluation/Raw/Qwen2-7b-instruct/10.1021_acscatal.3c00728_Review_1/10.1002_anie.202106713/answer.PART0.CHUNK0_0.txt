[1] "N2-BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[2] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[3] "Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

1. N2 plasma treatment resulted in a catalyst with high activity, achieving 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefin selectivity at 520°C. This indicates that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites play a crucial role in the efficiency of the catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

2. Oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) formed during O2 plasma treatment led to the suppression of catalytic performance, with only 12.4% propane conversion at 520°C. This suggests that the dimensionality and spatial arrangement of active sites can influence the effectiveness of catalysts for ODHP reactions.

3. During the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, boron-nitrogen (B-N) defects are generated. Three-boron center nitrogen-defects (TBC) are proposed to evolve into active BOx species, which facilitates the conversion of propane to propylene. This highlights the importance of understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of active sites, particularly one-dimensional (1-D) edge active sites, in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

1.N2等离子体处理后，催化剂表现出高活性，实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性在520°C。这表明活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的效率至关重要。

2. 氧化物等离子体处理导致的硼氧物种（BOx）形成导致催化性能下降，仅在520°C时实现了12.4%的丙烷转化率。这表明活性位点的维度和空间排列可以影响催化剂的ODHP反应效果。

3. 在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，生成了硼氮（B-N）缺陷。三硼中心氮缺陷（TBC）被认为可能演变成为活性BOx物种，进一步促进丙烷转化为丙烯。这强调了理解活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边沿活性位点的重要性，在设计更高效的商业应用催化剂方面具有重要意义。
