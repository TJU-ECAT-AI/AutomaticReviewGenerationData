[1] "N2-BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[2] "The sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[3] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN, and the band gap got narrower after washing (O2-BN-wash: 2.7eV)."
[4] "This phenomenon was more clearly observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Figure2ce, FigureS3)."
[5] "Interestingly, peaks ascribed to the N-H and B-H vibration were also found after the ODH reaction."
[6] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in their performance during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study highlights that 1-D edge active sites are particularly effective. The N2 plasma treatment led to the formation of more three-boron center nitrogen-defects (TBC), which were considered advantageous for generating active species in ODHP reactions. These defects, along with other N-defects (OBC), evolved into BOx species, which were essential for the conversion of propane to propylene. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The 1-D edge sites, as demonstrated by the SEM images and EPR spectra, show the ability to enhance reactivity, which is closely related to the increased N-defects. The presence of BOx species indicates that the sintering effect of these oxygen-containing boron species can negatively impact the catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of balancing these effects for optimal performance.

活性位点的空间分布和维度对基于B的催化剂在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中的性能至关重要。研究表明，1-D边活性位点特别有效。N2等离子体处理导致更多三硼中心氮缺陷（TBC）的形成，被认为是生成活性物种的关键因素，在ODHP反应中。这些缺陷与其它N缺陷（OBC）一起演化为BOx物种，这对于丙烷转化为丙烯是必要的。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂以供商业应用。通过扫描电子显微镜图像和EPR光谱显示，1-D边位点具有增强反应性的能力，这与增加的N缺陷密切相关。BOx物种的存在表明，这些氧含硼物种的烧结效应可能会负面影响催化活性，强调了平衡这些效应以实现最佳性能的重要性。
