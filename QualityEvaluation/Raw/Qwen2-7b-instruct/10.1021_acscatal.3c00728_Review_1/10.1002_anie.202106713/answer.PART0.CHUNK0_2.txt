The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites, such as those created by N2 plasma treatment, tend to exhibit superior activity. N2 plasma modifies the catalyst's surface by breaking chemical bonds in a controlled manner, resulting in the formation of more three-boron center nitrogen-defects. These defects are considered favorable for generating active species involved in the ODHP reaction. In contrast, the sintering effect caused by oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) in O2-treated BN catalysts leads to suppressed catalytic performance. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，B基催化剂中的活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其性能。特别是1-D边缘活性位点，在N2等离子体处理下表现得尤为突出。N2等离子体会以可控的方式改变催化剂表面的化学键，形成更多的三硼中心氮缺陷。这些缺陷被认为有利于生成参与ODHP反应的活性物种。相反，O2处理的BN催化剂中的BOx物种引起的烧结效应导致催化性能下降。理解这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂用于商业应用。
