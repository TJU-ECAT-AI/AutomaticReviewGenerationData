[1] "N2-BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[2] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[3] "Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

1. N2 plasma treatment resulted in a catalyst with high activity, achieving 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefin selectivity at 520°C. This indicates that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites play a crucial role in the efficiency of the catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

2. Oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) formed during O2 plasma treatment led to the suppression of catalytic performance, with only 12.4% propane conversion at 520°C. This suggests that the dimensionality and spatial arrangement of active sites can influence the effectiveness of catalysts for ODHP reactions.

3. During the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, boron-nitrogen (B-N) defects are generated. Three-boron center nitrogen-defects (TBC) are proposed to evolve into active BOx species, which facilitates the conversion of propane to propylene. This highlights the importance of understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of active sites, particularly one-dimensional (1-D) edge active sites, in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

"N2-BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 76.7% selectivity toward propylene or 89.4% for all olefins were achieved at 520C."
"Three new diffraction peaks at 2θ=14.6 and 27.8, and 37.7 appeared in the O2-BN pattern, proving that O2 plasma treatment introduced a considerable amount of new species to h-BN."
"FT-IR spectra of catalysts were given in Figure3a. Prior to the treatment of plasma, the spectrum of BN exhibited the characteristic in-plane B-N transverse stretching vibration at 1385cm1 and out-of-plane bending vibration at 803cm1, respectively."
"Interestingly, peaks ascribed to the N-H and B-H vibration were also found after the ODH reaction."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. N2 plasma treatment on h-BN creates more three-boron center nitrogen-defects, which are considered advantageous for generating active species. This leads to enhanced activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Oxygen-containing boron species are introduced during O2 plasma treatment, which affects the catalyst's activity. The acidity of fresh and spent catalysts is investigated to understand the differences between new oxygen-containing boron species and B2O3, providing insights into the catalyst's performance.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites, such as those created by N2 plasma treatment, tend to exhibit superior activity. N2 plasma modifies the catalyst's surface by breaking chemical bonds in a controlled manner, resulting in the formation of more three-boron center nitrogen-defects. These defects are considered favorable for generating active species involved in the ODHP reaction. In contrast, the sintering effect caused by oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) in O2-treated BN catalysts leads to suppressed catalytic performance. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，B基催化剂中的活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其性能。特别是1-D边缘活性位点，在N2等离子体处理下表现得尤为突出。N2等离子体会以可控的方式改变催化剂表面的化学键，形成更多的三硼中心氮缺陷。这些缺陷被认为有利于生成参与ODHP反应的活性物种。相反，O2处理的BN催化剂中的BOx物种引起的烧结效应导致催化性能下降。理解这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂用于商业应用。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in their performance during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study highlights that 1-D edge active sites are particularly effective. The N2 plasma treatment led to the formation of more three-boron center nitrogen-defects (TBC), which were considered advantageous for generating active species in ODHP reactions. These defects, along with other N-defects (OBC), evolved into BOx species, which were essential for the conversion of propane to propylene. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The 1-D edge sites, as demonstrated by the SEM images and EPR spectra, show the ability to enhance reactivity, which is closely related to the increased N-defects. The presence of BOx species indicates that the sintering effect of these oxygen-containing boron species can negatively impact the catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of balancing these effects for optimal performance.

活性位点的空间分布和维度对基于B的催化剂在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中的性能至关重要。研究表明，1-D边活性位点特别有效。N2等离子体处理导致更多三硼中心氮缺陷（TBC）的形成，被认为是生成活性物种的关键因素，在ODHP反应中。这些缺陷与其它N缺陷（OBC）一起演化为BOx物种，这对于丙烷转化为丙烯是必要的。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂以供商业应用。通过扫描电子显微镜图像和EPR光谱显示，1-D边位点具有增强反应性的能力，这与增加的N缺陷密切相关。BOx物种的存在表明，这些氧含硼物种的烧结效应可能会负面影响催化活性，强调了平衡这些效应以实现最佳性能的重要性。
