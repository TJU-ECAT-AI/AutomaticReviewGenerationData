[1] "Four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."
[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."
[3] "While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C)."
[4] "N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN."
[5] "The EPR signal of O2-BN was much greater than that of other catalysts."
[6] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6."

1. Four types of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were utilized to modify the local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). 
2. N2-treatment of BN resulted in a notable enhancement of activity, achieving 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity towards olefins at 520°C.
3. Oxygen plasma (O2) treatment of BN led to a decreased catalytic performance, with only 12.4% propane conversion at 520°C.
4. N2 plasma was effective in inducing defects within BN.
5. The EPR signal for O2-treated BN was notably higher than for other catalysts, suggesting the formation of active species.
6. The document proposes that the generation of N-defects and their transformation into BOx species occur during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 四种类型的等离子体（N2、O2、H2、Ar）被用来调节六方硼氮化物（h-BN）的局部化学环境。
2. N2处理后的BN表现出显著的活性，实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性，在520°C时。
3. 氧气等离子体（O2）处理后的BN导致了催化性能的下降，仅在520°C时实现了12.4%的丙烷转化率。
4. N2等离子体对BN有效诱导缺陷形成。
5. O2处理后的BN的EPR信号明显高于其他催化剂，表明形成了活性物种。
6. 文档提出，在丙烷氧化脱氢反应过程中，N缺陷的生成及其转化为BOx物种。
