Influence of boria loading on the acidity of B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam Abstract Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range 020 wt.-%. These materials were characterized by B.E.T. surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and were used as catalysts for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam by passing the oxime vapour through a reactor containing the catalysts at 300C. The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased, and all catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream. There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation. Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength. A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.

Answer: The boria loading on the B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts affects their acidity and, consequently, their performance in converting cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam. As the boria loading increases, the surface area decreases, leading to a reduction in activity over time. The highest boria loading tested resulted in the least amount of coke formation and retained the most activity. Surface acidic sites of intermediate strength are crucial for the selectivity towards caprolactam, and their concentration correlates with the selectivity. The catalyst with the highest boria loading showed the least coke formation and maintained higher activity, indicating better performance for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam.

文档中提到，硼酸负载对B2O3/Al2O3催化剂的酸性及其将环己酮肟转化为己内酰胺的性能有影响。随着硼酸负载的增加，表面积减小，导致随时间减少的活性。最高硼酸负载的催化剂表现出最少的焦炭形成和最高的活性保留。表面酸性中等强度的位点对于己内酰胺的选择性至关重要，并且其浓度与选择性成正比。具有最高硼酸负载的催化剂显示出最少的焦炭形成和更高的活性，表明在将环己酮肟转化为己内酰胺方面具有更好的性能。
