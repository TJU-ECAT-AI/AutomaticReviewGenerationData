The study investigated the influence of boria loading on the acidity of B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, specifically examining their use in the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam. It was found that as the boria loading increased, the surface areas of the samples decreased. This increase in boria loading led to a decrease in catalytic activity over time, with a direct correlation between the amount of coke formed on the surface and the loss in activity. Notably, the catalyst with the highest boron oxide loading showed the least coke formation and maintained the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity to caprolactam was linked to the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength, and there was an observed correlation between the concentration of these sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.

研究探讨了硼氧化物负载对B2O3/Al2O3催化剂酸性的影响，特别关注其在环己酮肟转化为己内酰胺过程中的应用。发现随着硼氧化物负载量的增加，样品的比表面积下降。高硼氧化物负载导致催化活性随时间下降，且表面焦炭形成量与活性损失成正比。值得注意的是，负载最高硼氧化物的催化剂焦炭形成最少，保持了最高的催化活性。选择性向己内酰胺的转化与表面中等强度酸性位点的存在有关，并观察到这些位点浓度与己内酰胺选择性之间的相关性。
