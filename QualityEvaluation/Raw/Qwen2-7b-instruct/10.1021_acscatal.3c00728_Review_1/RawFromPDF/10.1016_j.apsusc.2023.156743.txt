•
Superior performance of h-BN bowl in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and pollutant removal.
Abstract
Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space. Herein, we developed a unique approach to control the opening direction of bowl-like structures via self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening. The opening size can be adjusted by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives that is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure. Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants. This work provides an extended assembly interface strategy of oriented bowl-like structure materials for different applications.
