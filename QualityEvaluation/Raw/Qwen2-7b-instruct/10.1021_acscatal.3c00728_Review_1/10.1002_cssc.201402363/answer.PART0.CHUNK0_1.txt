Answer: The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts play a significant role in their performance during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. By modifying carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with boron, researchers have observed that the selectivity towards propene can be influenced by the type of heteroatom used and the compound employed as a precursor. The study also highlights that the boron loading and the calcination temperature impact the boron speciation and the catalytic conversion efficiency. Moreover, the choice of phosphorus precursor greatly affects the selectivity to propene, with CNFs doped using triphenylphosphine showing the highest selectivity at equivalent conversion levels.

1-D、2-D和3-D活性位点的空间分布对硼基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能有显著影响。通过将硼掺杂到碳纳米纤维（CNF）中，研究发现活性位点类型和前体化合物的选择性对于丙烯的选择性有重要影响。研究还表明，硼的负载量和煅烧温度会影响硼的物种分布和催化转化效率。此外，磷前体的选择显著影响丙烯选择性，使用三苯基膦作为前体的CNF显示出在等效转化率下最高的选择性。
