[1] "For low reaction temperatures (up to 730K) both propane and O2 conversion are higher for B-free CNF than 2%B-CNF."
[2] "For stable performance in long-term experiments, the maximum allowable temperature was 698K."
[3] "P doping brought about enhanced selectivity at isoconversion compared to B doping."
[4] "The two precursors gave rise to different P species on CNFs, which are more reduced for the catalyst prepared using triphenylphosphine."
[5] "CNFs doped with N groups during their growth were the most active in propane conversion but the least selective to propene."
[6] "Catalysts doped with B and P exhibited larger CO/CO2 ratios after reaction than pristine CNFs, which indicates the crucial role of groups that desorb CO in the selective formation of propene."

1. At low reaction temperatures (up to 730K), the conversion of both propane and oxygen is higher for boron-free carbon nanofibers (CNFs) compared to CNFs with 2% boron doping.

2. For stable performance in long-term experiments, the highest allowed temperature was determined to be 698K.

3. Phosphorus doping led to improved selectivity at isothermal conversions compared to boron doping.

4. The two precursors, triphenylphosphine and ammonium phosphate, resulted in different phosphorus species on CNFs, with the triphenylphosphine precursor leading to more reduced phosphorus species.

5. Carbon nanofibers doped with nitrogen groups during their growth were the most active in propane conversion but showed the least selectivity towards propene.

6. Boron and phosphorus doped catalysts displayed higher CO/CO2 ratios after the reaction, indicating the pivotal role of carbon desorbing groups in the selective formation of propene.

1. 在低反应温度（最高至730K）下，无硼碳纳米纤维（CNF）的丙烷和氧气转换率高于含2%硼的CNF。

2. 对于长期实验中的稳定性能，允许的最大温度被确定为698K。

3. 磷酸盐掺杂带来了在等温转化率下比硼掺杂更高的选择性。

4. 两种前体，三苯基膦和磷酸铵，导致了CNF上的不同磷物种，使用三苯基膦前体导致更还原的磷物种。

5. 含有氮组分在生长过程中掺杂的碳纳米纤维在丙烷转换中最为活跃，但对丙烯的选择性最低。

6. 含有硼和磷的催化剂在反应后显示出较高的CO/CO2比率，表明脱氢形成丙烯的关键作用在于碳的脱附组分。
