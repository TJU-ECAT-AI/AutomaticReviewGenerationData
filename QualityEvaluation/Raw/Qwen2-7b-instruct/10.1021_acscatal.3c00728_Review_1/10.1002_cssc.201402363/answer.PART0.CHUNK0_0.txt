[1] "The performance in propane ODH as a function of the reaction temperature using purified CNFs and 2%B-CNF as catalysts is shown in Figure4. For low reaction temperatures (up to 730K) both propane and O2 conversion are higher for B-free CNF than 2%B-CNF."
[2] "However, the selectivity is higher for 2%B-CNF in the whole range of temperatures."
[3] "Accordingly, the propene yield is higher for 2%B-CNF for temperatures above 723K and reaches around 11%, which is quite competitive compared to those obtained with catalysts based on metal oxides."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically 1-D edge active sites, influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. At lower temperatures (up to 730K), the conversion of both propane and oxygen (O2) is higher for catalysts without boron (B-free CNF) compared to those with 2% boron doping (2%B-CNF). However, the selectivity towards propene is higher for the 2%B-CNF across the entire temperature range. As a result, the yield of propene is notably higher for the 2%B-CNF at temperatures above 723K, achieving around 11%, demonstrating competitiveness compared to catalysts based on metal oxides.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，B基催化剂中的活性位点的空间分布和维度（特别是1-D边缘活性位点），影响其性能。在较低温度（至730K）下，无硼（B-free CNF）催化剂的丙烷和氧气（O2）转化率高于含2%硼掺杂（2%B-CNF）的催化剂。然而，在整个温度范围内，2%B-CNF的选择性更高。因此，在温度高于723K时，2%B-CNF的丙烯产率显著提高，达到约11%，与基于金属氧化物的催化剂相比显示出竞争力。
