[1] "The selectivity is affected by the type of heteroatom and also by the compound used as the precursor as they lead to different deactivation of unselective oxygenated sites on carbon."
[2] "The higher selectivities achieved using P- or B-doped CNTs have been explained in terms of P or B reaction with CNT sidewall defects that would suppress the formation of electrophilic O species, which are the cause of the decrease in selectivity."
[3] "Our results also show that the type of P precursor affects the selectivity to propene and that CNFs modified using triphenylphosphine as the precursor provided the highest selectivity at isoconversion."
[4] "Therefore, the doping heteroatom seems to affect the sites for O2 activation to a larger extent."

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of active sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites play a crucial role in the performance of B-based catalysts. The type of heteroatom and the compound used as the precursor significantly influence the deactivation of unselective oxygenated sites on the carbon. The interaction of P or B with CNT sidewall defects suppresses the formation of electrophilic O species, leading to improved selectivity. Moreover, the choice of precursor for P modification impacts the selectivity, with triphenylphosphine providing the highest selectivity at isoconversion. These insights highlight that the type of dopant affects the sites for O2 activation differently, thus guiding the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial use.
