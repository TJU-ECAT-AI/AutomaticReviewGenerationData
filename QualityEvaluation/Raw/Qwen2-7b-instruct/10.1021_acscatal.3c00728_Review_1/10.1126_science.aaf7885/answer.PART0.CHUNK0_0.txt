[5] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts is crucial for optimizing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. In the context of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), the active sites are primarily one-dimensional (1-D) edges, which differ significantly from traditional 0-D single-site catalysts (like supported vanadia) and 2-D surface catalysts (like Cu(111)). 

The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. **Stabilization of Olefin Selectivity**: The 1-D nature of the active sites prevents the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals, which is typical of 0-D single-site catalysts. This leads to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site, contributing to the high olefin selectivity observed.

2. **Prevention of Overoxidation**: The 1-D structure suppresses overoxidation, a common issue with 2-D surface catalysts. This is because diffusion of adsorbates is restricted, reducing the likelihood of unwanted reactions leading to the formation of COx products.

3. **Unique Oxygen Activation**: The reaction process involving these active sites demonstrates unique oxygen activation, which is influenced by the surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen. This influences the rate of propane consumption, highlighting the importance of oxygen functionality in the reaction mechanism.

4. **Inorganic Peroxide Species**: The >BOON< sites, which are akin to inorganic peroxide species, are capable of performing oxidation reactions, offering a distinct mechanism for the ODHP process compared to conventional catalysts.

5. **Radical Rebound Mechanism**: The proposed radical rebound mechanism for hydrogen atom abstraction from propane to the oxygen-terminated armchair BN edge site explains the high olefin selectivity. This mechanism contrasts with those of 0-D and 2-D sites, which tend to create reactive propyl radicals and facilitate overoxidation, respectively.

6. **Exothermic Steps**: All steps in the process, except for the desorption of propene, are exothermic, indicating that the reaction is energetically favorable and contributes to the efficiency of the catalyst.

Overall, the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of the 1-D edge active sites in h-BN and BNNTs enable high selectivity for the production of propene and ethene, making them promising candidates for commercial applications in the chemical industry, particularly in the production of propene from propane.

理解硼氮化物（B基）催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对于优化其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能至关重要。在六方硼氮化物（h-BN）和硼氮化物纳米管（BNNTs）的情况下，活性位点主要是线性（1-D）边缘，这与传统单点催化剂（如支持的钒氧化物）和二维表面催化剂（如Cu（111）表面）有显著差异。

这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制对设计商业应用中的更高效催化剂具有重要意义：

1. **烯烃选择性的稳定化**：1-D结构避免了形成高度反应性的丙基自由基，这是传统单点催化剂的特征。通过硝基自由基位点稳定丙基自由基，有助于观察到的高烯烃选择性。

2. **防止过度氧化**：1-D结构抑制了过度氧化，这是二维表面催化剂常见的问题。这是因为吸附剂的扩散被限制，从而减少了导致COx产物形成的不希望发生的反应的可能性。

3. **独特的氧激活**：该过程中的活性位点显示出独特的氧激活，受吸附氧表面覆盖的影响。这影响了丙烷消耗的速率，强调了氧功能在反应机制中的重要性。

4. **无机过氧化物种**：>BOON<位点类似于无机过氧化物种，能够执行氧化反应，与常规催化剂相比提供了不同的ODHP过程机制。

5. **自由基反弹机制**：从丙烷到氧终止的BN边缘站点的自由基反弹机制解释了高烯烃选择性。与零维和二维站点相比，这种机制减少了生成高度反应性的丙基自由基和促进过度氧化的可能性。

6. **放热步骤**：除了丙烯的脱附外，所有步骤都是放热的，表明反应是能量有利的，有助于催化剂的效率。

总的来说，1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制使h-BN和BNNT能够高效生产丙烯和乙烯，使它们成为化学工业中从丙烷生产丙烯的有前景的候选材料，特别是作为商业应用的一部分。
