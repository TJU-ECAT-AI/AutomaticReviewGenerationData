[1] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[2] "The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points toward a fundamentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with a different active site compared with other, previously studied and better understood catalysts for this reaction."
[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[4] "Indeed, BN samples from various suppliers and containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."

1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites contribute to the unique properties and reaction mechanisms, leading to improved selectivity for olefins compared to 0-D and 2-D sites. These sites prevent the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppress overoxidation, thus enhancing the efficiency of catalysts for commercial applications.

2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts, such as the stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites, enables the design of more efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions. This knowledge helps in optimizing catalyst performance and achieving higher olefin selectivity.

3. The high olefin selectivity observed in B-based catalysts can be attributed to the stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites, avoiding the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of 0-D single-site catalysts and suppressing overoxidation common in 2-D surface catalysts.

4. The fact that BN samples from various suppliers with different impurities exhibit almost identical catalytic performance indicates that metal impurities in the material do not significantly affect the catalyst's effectiveness. This finding suggests that the unique properties of BN materials, rather than specific impurities, are responsible for their catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

1. 在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。特别是1-D边缘活性位点贡献了独特的性质和反应机制，与之前研究和理解较好的催化剂相比，这些位点导致了较高的烯烃选择性。这些位点避免了形成高度活性的丙基自由基，并抑制了过氧化，从而提高了商业应用中催化剂的效率。

2. 理解B基催化剂中1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，如丙基自由基由硝基自由基位点稳定，使得设计更高效的ODHP反应催化剂成为可能。这种知识有助于优化催化剂性能并实现更高的烯烃选择性。

3. 观察到的高烯烃选择性可以归因于由硝基自由基位点稳定丙基自由基，避免了形成典型的0-D单点催化剂中高度活性的丙基自由基，并抑制了在2-D表面催化剂中常见的过氧化。

4. 不同供应商提供的BN样品具有不同杂质，但其催化性能几乎相同的事实表明，材料中的金属杂质对催化剂的有效性影响不大。这一发现表明，BN材料的独特性质，而不是特定杂质，是它们在ODHP反应中催化性能的原因。
