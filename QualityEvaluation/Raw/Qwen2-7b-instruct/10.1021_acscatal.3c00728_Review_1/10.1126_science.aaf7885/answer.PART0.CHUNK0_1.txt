[1] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction."
[2] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[3] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1-D nature of the active sites, specifically the oxygen-terminated armchair BN edges, contributes to the observed high olefin selectivity. This is attributed to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site, which avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical typical of 0D single-site catalysts and suppresses overoxidation usually associated with 2D surface catalysts. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts with improved selectivity for commercial applications.

B-based催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能。1-D性质的活性位点，特别是氧终止的BN臂链边缘，有助于观察到的高烯烃选择性。这归因于由硝基自由基位点稳定丙基自由基，避免了通常与0D单点催化剂相关的高度活泼丙基自由基的产生，并抑制了与2D表面催化剂相关的吸附物种的过氧化。理解这些独特的特性和反应机制使设计具有改进选择性的更高效催化剂成为可能，以供商业应用。
