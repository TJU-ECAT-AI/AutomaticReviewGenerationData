[1] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction."
[2] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."
[3] "Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."
[4] "The proposed intermediate structures and energies of the overall catalytic cycle are included in fig. S11."
[5] "We envision that a second abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a primary carbon follows another radical rebound, and creates a di-propoxyl intermediate."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. In particular, 1-D edge active sites are crucial for the observed high olefin selectivity. This selectivity is largely attributed to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Unlike 0-D single-site catalysts, which create highly reactive propyl radicals, and 2-D surface catalysts, which suppress the stabilization of adsorbed species and promote overoxidation, the 1-D nature of the edge avoids the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。特别是1-D边缘活性位点对于观察到的高烯烃选择性至关重要。这种选择性主要归因于由硝基自由基位点稳定丙基自由基。与形成高度活性丙基自由基的0-D单点催化剂不同，与抑制吸附物种的稳定性和促进过氧化作用的2-D表面催化剂不同，1-D边缘避免了形成高度活性的丙基自由基，并抑制了过氧化作用。了解这些独特的特性和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂以用于商业应用。
