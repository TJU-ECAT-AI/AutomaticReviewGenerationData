The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, one-dimensional (1-D) edge active sites, like oxygen-terminated armchair edges of boron nitride (BN), demonstrate superior properties compared to zero-dimensional (0-D) single-site catalysts and two-dimensional (2-D) surface catalysts. These 1-D edges avoid the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of 0-D catalysts and suppress overoxidation of adsorbed species, which is common in 2-D surface catalysts. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Understanding these properties allows for the optimization of catalyst performance, leading to enhanced selectivity to olefins, such as propene and ethene, and improved stability during prolonged operation.

The high olefin selectivity observed in the ODHP reaction using boron nitride catalysts is attributed to the stabilization of the propyl radical by a nitroxyl radical site. This stabilization is facilitated by the one-dimensional nature of the active site, which prevents the formation of highly reactive propyl radicals, a common issue with zero-dimensional catalysts. Additionally, the suppression of overoxidation of adsorbed species, a typical problem with two-dimensional surfaces, contributes to the overall selectivity.

The second-order rate dependence of the reaction with respect to propane concentration (Pc3h8) indicates that two propane molecules are required to generate two molecules of water. This finding aligns with the stoichiometry of the reaction and provides insight into the mechanism of water desorption, which is an exothermic step in the overall catalytic cycle. The desorption of water molecules forms boron nitride edge vacancies, facilitating unique oxygen activation and contributing to the overall efficiency of the reaction.

在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。特别是，一维（1-D）边缘活性位点，如硼氮化物（BN）的氧终止的臂椅边缘，与零维（0-D）单个位点催化剂和二维（2-D）表面催化剂相比，显示出优越的性质。这些1-D边缘避免了形成典型的0-D催化剂中高度反应性的丙基自由基，并抑制了2-D表面催化剂中吸附物种的过度氧化。这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特特性和反应机制为商业应用中催化剂的设计提供了贡献，促进了更高效催化剂的设计。

观察到的高烯烃选择性在使用硼氮化物催化剂进行ODHP反应时归因于丙基自由基由硝基自由基位点的稳定。这种稳定得益于1-D性质的活性位点，防止了形成高度反应性的丙基自由基，这是零维催化剂常见的问题。此外，与二维表面催化剂中常见的吸附物种过度氧化相比，抑制了总体选择性。

反应对丙烷浓度（Pc3h8）的二次速率依赖性表明，需要两个丙烷分子生成两个水分子。这一发现与反应的化学计量学一致，提供了水解吸机制的见解，这是一个在整体催化循环中是放热的步骤。水分子的解吸形成了硼氮化物边缘空位，促进独特的氧激活，从而增加了反应的整体效率。
