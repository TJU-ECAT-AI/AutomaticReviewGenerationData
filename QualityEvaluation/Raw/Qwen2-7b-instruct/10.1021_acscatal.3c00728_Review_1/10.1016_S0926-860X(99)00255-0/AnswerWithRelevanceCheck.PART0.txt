          3. "The performance of supported boria catalysts can be improved by proper control of variable factors such as nature of the support, load and dispersion of boria."
          4. "Recently, we found that boria supported on zirconia (B2O3/ZrO2) shows, among many modified zirconia catalysts such as zirconias doped with alkali metal, halogen, sulfate, or phosphate ions, the best catalysis for the synthesis of ε-caprolactam; the average lactam yield during 6 h time on stream (TOS) was 95%."
          5. "Increasing the boria load (20%) results in an increase of the lactam selectivity, but the lactam yield follows variation of the oxime conversion which shows a maximum at 10% boria load."
          6. "It is clear that all of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are far superior to the support alone (with zero boria load, Fig. 4) for the Beckmann reaction."
          7. "The optimum boria load (10%) corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support."
          8. "Our primary work which investigates effects of solvents and carrier gases has revealed that an use of CO2 as the reaction carrier gas has a remarkable effect in preventing deactivation of the 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst."

          The performance of supported boria catalysts can be optimized through strategic adjustments of various parameters including the type of support material, boron oxide load, and its dispersion. Notably, the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst, when supported on zirconia, exhibits exceptional catalytic efficiency in synthesizing ε-caprolactam, achieving an average yield of 95% over a 6-hour operation period. Increasing the boron oxide load to 20% boosts the lactam selectivity, albeit with a fluctuating lactam yield that peaks at a boron oxide load of 10%. All B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts demonstrate superior performance compared to zirconia alone in the Beckmann reaction. The optimal boron oxide load is determined to be 10%, corresponding to two layers of boron oxide on the zirconia support. Additionally, our research highlights the significant benefit of using carbon dioxide as the reaction carrier gas in mitigating catalyst deactivation for the 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst.

          支持型硼酸催化剂的性能可以通过对支持材料类型、硼酸氧化物负载和其分散性的策略调整来优化。特别地，当在氧化锆上支持时，B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在合成ε-己内酰胺中的催化效率表现出色，6小时内平均乳酸产量达到95%。将硼酸氧化物负载增加到20%可以提高乳酸选择性，尽管乳酸产量随氧化肟转化率的变化而波动，最大值出现在10%的硼酸氧化物负载。所有B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在贝克曼反应中的表现均优于仅由氧化锆组成的系统。最优的硼酸氧化物负载确定为10%，对应在氧化锆支持物上的两层硼酸氧化物。此外，我们的研究强调了使用二氧化碳作为反应载体气体在防止10% B2O3/ZrO2催化剂失活方面的重要作用。

          3.1. Effect of reaction temperature

In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction.

3.2. Comparison with other supports

A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.3. Effect of the boria load

Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements

Fig. 7 shows the infrared spectra of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. The sample with 5% B2O3 shows two broad absorption bands at 13801430 and 10001150 cm1. The band at 13801430 cm1 shifts upto 1460 cm1 while the band at 1001150 cm1 disappears with increasing the boria load. Simultaneously, new bands at 1190 and 885 cm1 grow in proportion with the boria load.

NH3-TPD is performed to compare the surface acidity of the catalysts. The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8. Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively.

          The study investigated the effect of reaction temperature on the synthesis of ε-caprolactam using B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts supported on zirconia. The catalysts were operated at 300°C and 350°C, demonstrating the highest lactam yield of over 94% for a 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst at both temperatures. For comparison, six other oxide supports (ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and HZSM-5) were utilized to support 10% B2O3 under similar conditions. The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was optimized by adjusting the boron oxide load, which was then compared in the Beckmann reaction at 300°C for a duration of 6 hours. The infrared spectra of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts reveal changes in the absorption bands with varying boron oxide load. Specifically, the band at 1380-1430 cm−1 shifts to 1460 cm−1 and the band at 1000-1150 cm−1 diminishes as the boron oxide load increases, indicating alterations in the catalyst structure. The ammonia thermogravimetric desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis further elucidates the surface acidity of the catalysts, with distinct peaks centered around 100°C, 200°C, and 300°C, respectively, highlighting the diverse acidic properties across different temperatures.

          研究考察了在氧化锆上支持的B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在不同反应温度下合成ε-己内酰胺的效果。在300°C和350°C下操作催化剂，显示出10% B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在两种温度下的最高乳酸产量超过94%。为了对比，使用了六种其他氧化物支持（ZrO2、TiO2、SiO2、Al2O3、MgO和HZSM-5），在相似条件下支持10% B2O3。通过调整硼酸氧化物负载优化了B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的性能，并在300°C下进行了6小时的贝克曼反应进行比较。B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的红外光谱显示了负载量变化时吸收带的变化。具体而言，1380-1430 cm−1的带向1460 cm−1移动，1000-1150 cm−1的带随着硼酸氧化物负载的增加消失，表明催化剂结构发生了改变。氨热重吸附（NH3-TPD）分析进一步阐明了催化剂的表面酸性，分别在约100°C、200°C和300°C处出现三个峰，突显了不同温度下催化剂的多样酸性特征。
