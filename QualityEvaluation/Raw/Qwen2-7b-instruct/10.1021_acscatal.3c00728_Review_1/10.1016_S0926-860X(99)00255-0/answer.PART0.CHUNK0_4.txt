3.1. Effect of reaction temperature

In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction. In the present work, the rearrangement is carried out with temperatures in the range of 250350C over this catalyst to optimize the reaction temperature.

3.2. Comparison with other supports

A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.3. Effect of the boria load

Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements

Fig. 7 shows the infrared spectra of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. The sample with 5% B2O3 shows two broad absorption bands at 13801430 and 10001150 cm1. The band at 13801430 cm1 shifts upto 1460 cm1 while the band at 1001150 cm1 disappears with increasing the boria load. Simultaneously, new bands at 1190 and 885 cm1 grow in proportion with the boria load.

NH3-TPD is performed to compare the surface acidity of the catalysts. The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8. Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively.

4. Discussion

The present data suggest that B2O3/ZrO2 is highly active and selective for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. At 10% boria load level the catalyst supported on zirconia shows much higher yield for the lactam syntheis than the ones on the other supports used in the present study. This 10% boria load happens to match the optimum boria load over the zirconia support (Fig. 4, Fig. 6).

1. The optimal temperature for the synthesis of ε-caprolactam through the gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime ranges from 300 to 320 degrees Celsius.
2. Among the catalysts tested, the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst performs the best for synthesizing ε-caprolactam, showing the highest lactam yield of over 94% at 300 degrees Celsius.
3. The boria load affects the catalytic performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst, with the optimum load level of 10% resulting in the highest lactam yield and selectivity. Higher boria loads lead to increased lactam selectivity but also affect catalyst stability.
4. The structure and acidity of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are influenced by the boria load, with tetrahedral BO4 units forming in the first monolayer and additional BO3 units developing at higher boria loads.
5. The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is related to the number of intermediate strong acid sites responsible for ammonia desorption at 200-400 degrees Celsius, and the optimum boria load corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support.

1. 气相贝克曼重排合成ε-己内酰胺的最佳温度范围为300至320摄氏度。
2. 在测试的催化剂中，B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在300摄氏度下表现出最佳的ε-己内酰胺合成性能，乳酸产量超过94%。
3. B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的负载量对其催化性能有影响，最优负载量为10%，能产生最高的乳酸产量和选择性。较高的负载量会导致乳酸选择性的增加，但同时也影响催化剂稳定性。
4. B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的结构和酸性受负载量的影响，第一层主要由四面体BO4单元组成，随着负载量的增加，形成更多的三面体BO3单元。
5. B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的性能与介于200-400摄氏度之间脱附的中间强酸位点的数量有关，最优的负载量对应着zirconia支持物上的两层boria。
