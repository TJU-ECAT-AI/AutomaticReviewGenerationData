3.1. Effect of reaction temperature

In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction.

3.2. Comparison with other supports

A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.3. Effect of the boria load

Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements

Fig. 7 shows the infrared spectra of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. The sample with 5% B2O3 shows two broad absorption bands at 13801430 and 10001150 cm1. The band at 13801430 cm1 shifts upto 1460 cm1 while the band at 1001150 cm1 disappears with increasing the boria load. Simultaneously, new bands at 1190 and 885 cm1 grow in proportion with the boria load.

NH3-TPD is performed to compare the surface acidity of the catalysts. The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8. Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites play a critical role. The study found that increasing the boria load up to 10% on a zirconia support resulted in the highest activity and selectivity for the lactam synthesis. This optimal boria load corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, where the monolayer dispersed BO4 state of boria is not efficient for the lactam synthesis. The development of BO3 structure units by stacking boria onto the first monolayer of their BO4 colleagues on the zirconia surface is crucial for the selective synthesis of lactam. This knowledge contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites.

The study also found that the spatial distribution of active sites affects the catalyst's performance. The presence of 1-D edge active sites, specifically BO3 units, enhances the catalyst's ability to selectively synthesize lactam. The study further revealed that increasing the boria load beyond the optimal level of 10% leads to a decrease in the number of active sites, which in turn reduces the activity and stability of the catalyst. This is due to the burying of BO3 units by higher stack thickness, reducing their accessibility to reactants. Understanding these dynamics allows for the optimization of catalysts to achieve higher efficiency and stability in commercial applications.

The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is affected by the boria load. Increasing the boria load up to 20% results in an increase in the lactam selectivity and the percentage of intermediate strong acid sites. However, the lactam yield coincides with the activity and the number of such acid sites. The optimum boria load corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, which optimizes the spatial distribution of active sites and enhances the catalytic performance.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能产生影响。特别是1-D边活性位点起到了关键作用。研究发现，在锆基质上负载10%的B2O3可实现最佳的乳酸酯合成活性和选择性，该最优负载对应于在锆基质上形成两层Boria。单层分散的BO4状态的Boria不适合乳酸酯合成。通过将Boria堆叠到其BO4同事的第一层上并形成BO3结构单位，可以在锆基质表面形成关键的乳酸选择性位点。这些知识有助于通过理解这些1-D边活性位点的独特性质和反应机制来设计更高效的商用催化剂。

研究还发现，活性位点的空间分布影响催化剂的性能。存在1-D边活性位点，尤其是BO3单元，增强了催化剂选择性合成乳酸酯的能力。研究进一步揭示，将Boria负载增加至最优水平10%以上会导致活性位点数量减少，进而降低活性和稳定性。这是由于更高堆叠厚度下埋藏了BO3单元，减少了它们对反应物的可接近性。理解这些动态特性允许对催化剂进行优化以实现更高的效率和稳定性在商用应用中。

B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的性能受到Boria负载的影响。将Boria负载增加至20%，结果导致乳酸酯选择性的提高和中间强酸位点百分比的增加。然而，乳酸酯产率与活性和此类酸位点的数量一致。最优Boria负载对应于在锆基质上形成两层Boria，这优化了活性位点的空间分布并增强了催化性能。
