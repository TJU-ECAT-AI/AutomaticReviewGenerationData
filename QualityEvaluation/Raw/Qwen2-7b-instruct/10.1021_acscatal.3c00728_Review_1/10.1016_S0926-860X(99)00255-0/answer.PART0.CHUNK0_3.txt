3.1. Effect of reaction temperature
"In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction."

3.2. Comparison with other supports
"A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."

3.3. Effect of the boria load
"Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h."

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements
"NH3-TPD is performed to compare the surface acidity of the catalysts. The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8 . Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively."

The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst in the gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime is influenced by the reaction temperature. A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield at either 300°C or 350°C for a 6-hour reaction period. Comparing with other oxide supports (ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and HZSM-5), the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated the best catalytic performance for the lactam synthesis at a 10% boria load level. The boria load also affects the catalyst's behavior; increasing the boria load from 10% to 20% results in an increase of lactam selectivity, though the lactam yield is influenced by the oxime conversion. The acidity and dispersion structure of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts were measured using NH3-TPD and IR spectroscopy. It was found that the lactam yield correlates with the number of intermediate strong acid sites responsible for ammonia desorption at 200-400°C. The optimum boria load (10%) corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, with the first layer interacting directly with the support surface, and the other layers constructed by trigonal BO3 units. The IR measurement revealed that tetrahedral oxygen-coordinated boron (BO4) units are the main structure of boria dispersion at low boria load (5%), while trigonal BO3 units increase with higher boria load.

反应温度对B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在环己酮肟气相贝克曼重排中的性能有影响。在300°C或350°C下进行6小时反应时，10% B2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出最高的乳酸酯产率。与ZrO2、TiO2、SiO2、Al2O3、MgO和HZSM-5等其他氧化物支持相比，10%负载的B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在乳酸酯合成中表现出了最佳的催化性能。随着B2O3负载量从10%增加到20%，乳酸选择性有所增加，但乳酸产率受到肟转化的影响。通过NH3-TPD和IR光谱测量了催化剂的酸性和分散结构。发现乳酸产率与200-400°C下吸附氨的脱附量有关的中间强酸位点数量成正比。最佳的B2O3负载量（10%）对应于zirconia表面的两层Boria，第一层直接与支持表面相互作用，而其他层由三角形BO3单元构成。IR测量显示，在低B2O3负载（5%）下，硼酸主要以四面体氧配位的硼（BO4）单元为结构，而随着B2O3负载量的增加，三棱形BO3单元的数量增加。
