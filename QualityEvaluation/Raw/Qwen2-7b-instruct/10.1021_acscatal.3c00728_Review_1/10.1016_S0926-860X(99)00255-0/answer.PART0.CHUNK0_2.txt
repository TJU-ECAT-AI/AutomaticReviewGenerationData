The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites, when optimally dispersed on the catalyst surface, enhance the reaction efficiency. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The dispersion structure of boria plays a critical role in influencing the performance of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. An optimum boria load (10%) corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, leading to the best performance for the synthesis of ε-caprolactam. This demonstrates that the dimensionality and spatial arrangement of active sites are key factors in enhancing catalyst efficiency in specific reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是关注于1-D边缘活性位点，在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中的性能方面起着重要作用。当这些位点在催化剂表面最佳分散时，可以提高反应效率。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂以满足商业应用需求。硼酸的分散结构对B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的性能产生关键影响。10%的最佳硼酸负载对应于zirconia支持上的两层硼酸，这使得合成ε-丙酰胺的最佳性能成为可能。这表明活性位点的维度和空间排列是提高特定反应催化剂效率的关键因素。
