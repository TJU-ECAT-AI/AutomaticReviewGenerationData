3.1. Effect of reaction temperature

In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction.

3.2. Comparison with other supports

A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.3. Effect of the boria load

Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements

Fig. 7 shows the infrared spectra of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. The sample with 5% B2O3 shows two broad absorption bands at 13801430 and 10001150 cm1. The band at 13801430 cm1 shifts upto 1460 cm1 while the band at 1001150 cm1 disappears with increasing the boria load. Simultaneously, new bands at 1190 and 885 cm1 grow in proportion with the boria load.

NH3-TPD is performed to compare the surface acidity of the catalysts. The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8. Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites play a critical role. The study found that increasing the boria load up to 10% on a zirconia support resulted in the highest activity and selectivity for the lactam synthesis. This optimal boria load corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, where the monolayer dispersed BO4 state of boria is not efficient for the lactam synthesis. The development of BO3 structure units by stacking boria onto the first monolayer of their BO4 colleagues on the zirconia surface is crucial for the selective synthesis of lactam. This knowledge contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites.

The study also found that the spatial distribution of active sites affects the catalyst's performance. The presence of 1-D edge active sites, specifically BO3 units, enhances the catalyst's ability to selectively synthesize lactam. The study further revealed that increasing the boria load beyond the optimal level of 10% leads to a decrease in the number of active sites, which in turn reduces the activity and stability of the catalyst. This is due to the burying of BO3 units by higher stack thickness, reducing their accessibility to reactants. Understanding these dynamics allows for the optimization of catalysts to achieve higher efficiency and stability in commercial applications.

The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is affected by the boria load. Increasing the boria load up to 20% results in an increase in the lactam selectivity and the percentage of intermediate strong acid sites. However, the lactam yield coincides with the activity and the number of such acid sites. The optimum boria load corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, which optimizes the spatial distribution of active sites and enhances the catalytic performance.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能产生影响。特别是1-D边活性位点起到了关键作用。研究发现，在锆基质上负载10%的B2O3可实现最佳的乳酸酯合成活性和选择性，该最优负载对应于在锆基质上形成两层Boria。单层分散的BO4状态的Boria不适合乳酸酯合成。通过将Boria堆叠到其BO4同事的第一层上并形成BO3结构单位，可以在锆基质表面形成关键的乳酸选择性位点。这些知识有助于通过理解这些1-D边活性位点的独特性质和反应机制来设计更高效的商用催化剂。

研究还发现，活性位点的空间分布影响催化剂的性能。存在1-D边活性位点，尤其是BO3单元，增强了催化剂选择性合成乳酸酯的能力。研究进一步揭示，将Boria负载增加至最优水平10%以上会导致活性位点数量减少，进而降低活性和稳定性。这是由于更高堆叠厚度下埋藏了BO3单元，减少了它们对反应物的可接近性。理解这些动态特性允许对催化剂进行优化以实现更高的效率和稳定性在商用应用中。

B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的性能受到Boria负载的影响。将Boria负载增加至20%，结果导致乳酸酯选择性的提高和中间强酸位点百分比的增加。然而，乳酸酯产率与活性和此类酸位点的数量一致。最优Boria负载对应于在锆基质上形成两层Boria，这优化了活性位点的空间分布并增强了催化性能。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites, when optimally dispersed on the catalyst surface, enhance the reaction efficiency. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The dispersion structure of boria plays a critical role in influencing the performance of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. An optimum boria load (10%) corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, leading to the best performance for the synthesis of ε-caprolactam. This demonstrates that the dimensionality and spatial arrangement of active sites are key factors in enhancing catalyst efficiency in specific reactions.

The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst in the gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime is influenced by the reaction temperature. A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield at either 300°C or 350°C for a 6-hour reaction period. Comparing with other oxide supports (ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and HZSM-5), the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated the best catalytic performance for the lactam synthesis at a 10% boria load level. The boria load also affects the catalyst's behavior; increasing the boria load from 10% to 20% results in an increase of lactam selectivity, though the lactam yield is influenced by the oxime conversion. The acidity and dispersion structure of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts were measured using NH3-TPD and IR spectroscopy. It was found that the lactam yield correlates with the number of intermediate strong acid sites responsible for ammonia desorption at 200-400°C. The optimum boria load (10%) corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support, with the first layer interacting directly with the support surface, and the other layers constructed by trigonal BO3 units. The IR measurement revealed that tetrahedral oxygen-coordinated boron (BO4) units are the main structure of boria dispersion at low boria load (5%), while trigonal BO3 units increase with higher boria load.

反应温度对B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在环己酮肟气相贝克曼重排中的性能有影响。在300°C或350°C下进行6小时反应时，10% B2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出最高的乳酸酯产率。与ZrO2、TiO2、SiO2、Al2O3、MgO和HZSM-5等其他氧化物支持相比，10%负载的B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在乳酸酯合成中表现出了最佳的催化性能。随着B2O3负载量从10%增加到20%，乳酸选择性有所增加，但乳酸产率受到肟转化的影响。通过NH3-TPD和IR光谱测量了催化剂的酸性和分散结构。发现乳酸产率与200-400°C下吸附氨的脱附量有关的中间强酸位点数量成正比。最佳的B2O3负载量（10%）对应于zirconia表面的两层Boria，第一层直接与支持表面相互作用，而其他层由三角形BO3单元构成。IR测量显示，在低B2O3负载（5%）下，硼酸主要以四面体氧配位的硼（BO4）单元为结构，而随着B2O3负载量的增加，三棱形BO3单元的数量增加。

A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction. In the present work, the rearrangement is carried out with temperatures in the range of 250350C over this catalyst to optimize the reaction temperature.

3.2. Comparison with other supports

A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

4. Discussion

The present data suggest that B2O3/ZrO2 is highly active and selective for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. At 10% boria load level the catalyst supported on zirconia shows much higher yield for the lactam syntheis than the ones on the other supports used in the present study. This 10% boria load happens to match the optimum boria load over the zirconia support (Fig. 4, Fig. 6).
