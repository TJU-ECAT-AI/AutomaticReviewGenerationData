3. "The performance of supported boria catalysts can be improved by proper control of variable factors such as nature of the support, load and dispersion of boria."
4. "Recently, we found that boria supported on zirconia (B2O3/ZrO2) shows, among many modified zirconia catalysts such as zirconias doped with alkali metal, halogen, sulfate, or phosphate ions, the best catalysis for the synthesis of ε-caprolactam; the average lactam yield during 6 h time on stream (TOS) was 95%."
5. "Increasing the boria load (20%) results in an increase of the lactam selectivity, but the lactam yield follows variation of the oxime conversion which shows a maximum at 10% boria load."
6. "It is clear that all of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are far superior to the support alone (with zero boria load, Fig. 4) for the Beckmann reaction."
7. "The optimum boria load (10%) corresponds to two overlayers of boria on the zirconia support."
8. "Our primary work which investigates effects of solvents and carrier gases has revealed that an use of CO2 as the reaction carrier gas has a remarkable effect in preventing deactivation of the 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst."

1. The performance of supported boria catalysts can be enhanced through the proper management of variables like the support type, boria load, and dispersion.
2. The B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst, when supported on zirconia, demonstrates the highest catalytic efficiency for ε-caprolactam synthesis, achieving a 95% lactam yield over 6 hours.
3. Boosting the boria load by 20% increases lactam selectivity, though this coincides with variations in oxime conversion, peaking at a 10% boria load.
4. Compared to the zirconia support alone, all B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit superior performance for the Beckmann reaction.
5. The optimal boria load of 10% corresponds to two layers of boria on the zirconia support.
6. Our preliminary research indicates that employing CO2 as the reaction carrier gas significantly mitigates catalyst deactivation for the 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst.

1. 支持型硼酸催化剂的性能可以通过适当管理支持类型、硼酸负载和分散性来提升。
2. 当在氧化锆上支持时，B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在ε-己内酰胺合成中的催化效率最高，6小时内平均乳酸产量达到95%。
3. 将硼酸负载增加20%可以提高乳酸的选择性，但这一变化与氧化肟转化率的变化相吻合，峰值出现在10%硼酸负载。
4. 相比于仅由氧化锆组成的体系，所有B2O3/ZrO2催化剂在贝克曼反应中表现更优。
5. 最佳硼酸负载为10%，对应在氧化锆表面的两层硼酸。
6. 我们初步研究发现，使用二氧化碳作为反应载体气体显著减少了10% B2O3/ZrO2催化剂的失活现象。
