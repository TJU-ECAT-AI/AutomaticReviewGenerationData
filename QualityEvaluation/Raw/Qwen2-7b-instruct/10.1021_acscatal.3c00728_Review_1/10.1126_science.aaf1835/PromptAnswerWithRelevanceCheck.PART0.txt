<p>The conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid fuels or chemicals often proceeds through the production of CO and H2. This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.</p>
<p>For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup.</p>
<p>Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong).</p>
<p>A zinc-chromium oxide creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>This composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>
<p>CO and H2 are activated over a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) surface, whereas CC coupling is controlled within the confined environment of zeolite pores with acidic sites.</p>
<p>The partially reduced oxide in activating CO but incapability of catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx makes it possible to manipulate CC coupling with confined acidic zeolite pores.</p>
<p>The CO conversion and selectivity can be tuned at the same time - CO conversion is manipulated via the surface structure of the oxides and the ratio of oxides/zeolite, whereas the olefin selectivity is controlled by the properties of zeolites, particularly the pore structure and acidity.</p>

The bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al. utilizes a zinc-chromium oxide to create ketene intermediates, which are then coupled over a zeolite. This catalyst avoids deactivation and allows for higher conversions of syngas to hydrocarbons, particularly light olefins, with minimal carbon buildup. The catalyst's components, a partially reduced oxide surface and a zeolite with acidic sites, enable precise control over carbon-carbon coupling, allowing for selective formation of light olefins. The catalyst can be tuned for CO conversion and selectivity by adjusting the oxide's surface structure and its ratio to the zeolite. The zeolite's pore structure and acidity are crucial in controlling olefin selectivity. This bifunctional catalyst enables the utilization of syngas derived from coal and biomass with a low hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio.

The bifunctional catalyst utilized in the process achieves a high C2=C4= selectivity of up to 80% and a total C2C4 selectivity of 94% at a CO conversion rate of 17%. This is accomplished through the use of two complementary active sites. One site, the partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx), activates CO and H2, while the other, confined within the acidic pores of zeolites, manipulates CC coupling. The catalyst demonstrates excellent stability, maintaining a total C2C4 selectivity of over 90% and a C2=C4= selectivity of 78% during a 110-hour test under specific conditions.

该双功能催化剂在17%的CO转化率下，实现了高达80%的C2=C4=选择性和94%的总C2C4选择性。这是通过使用两种互补的活性位点实现的。一个位点是部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx），激活CO和H2；另一个则位于酸性孔道内的沸石中，控制CC耦合。该催化剂表现出极好的稳定性，在特定条件下进行110小时测试时，总C2C4选择性保持在超过90%，C2=C4=选择性为78%。

<p>However, application of this technology is still limited by low olefin selectivity and high methane selectivity, as well as severe carbon deposition.</p>
<p>It can be described by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model (7, 8), which predicts that selectivity of C2 to C4 hydrocarbons (C2C4), including C2=C4= olefins and C2oC4o paraffins, does not exceed 58% (6).</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C).</p>
<p>The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat.</p>
<p>CH2 species are very active and readily react with CO in the presence of CO, forming a relatively less reactive ketene (26, 27), which is detectable by SVUV-PIMS.</p>
<p>In contrast, a commercially available SAPO-34 exhibiting NH3 desorption at 394C had a C2=C4= selectivity of 43% and an olefin/paraffin ratio (C2=C4=/C2oC4o) of 0.9.</p>
<p>Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there may exist an optimum acidity with NH3 desorption temperature <350C for olefin formation.</p>

The bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al. achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. It uses a zinc-chromium oxide to create ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite. The process reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at a CO conversion of 17%. This is enabled by a composite catalyst that contains two types of active sites with complementary properties, allowing for precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation. The catalyst maintains stable performance over 110 hours, with no obvious deactivation. The composite catalyst and process may allow the use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio. The catalyst's bifunctionality and the unique properties of the active sites contribute to its efficiency and selectivity in converting syngas to light olefins.

[2] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
[3] "In the absence of MSAPO (corresponding to Mode 1 of Fig. 2A), syngas was converted mainly to CH4 (selectivity 53%), and selectivity to C2C4 hydrocarbons was only 38% over ZnCrOx."
[4] "In the presence of ZnCrOx, a signal of mass/charge ratio (m/z) = 42.01 appeared in the effluents at a photon energy hυ = 9.72 eV (Fig. 2D) in addition to stable hydrocarbon products."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in the bifunctional catalyst are crucial for the selective conversion of syngas to light olefins. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, while the confined acidic pores of zeolites manipulate CC coupling. This dual-site system ensures both CO conversion and selectivity control, allowing for the production of light olefins with high selectivity and minimal methane formation.

When the catalyst lacks the mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO), the conversion primarily yields methane, with a lower selectivity for C2C4 hydrocarbons compared to the presence of MSAPO. The zeolite component, specifically its acidic sites, plays a critical role in controlling the CC coupling, enabling the selective formation of olefins.

In the presence of ZnCrOx, ketene intermediates are formed, which are then coupled within the confined acidic pores of the zeolite. This process facilitates the production of light olefins, as demonstrated by the detection of ketene ions in the effluents using synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS).

在双功能催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度对于选择性地将合成气转化为轻烯烃至关重要。部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活CO和H2，而沸石的酸性孔内控制CC耦合。这种双活性位系统确保了CO转化和选择性的控制，允许以高选择性和最小的甲烷形成生产轻烯烃。

当催化剂缺乏微孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）时，主要的转换产生甲烷，与MSAPO存在相比，C2C4烃类的选择性较低。沸石组分，尤其是其酸性位点，在控制CC耦合方面起着关键作用，使轻烯烃的选择性形成成为可能。

在ZnCrOx的存在下，形成了酮烯中间体，然后在沸石的限定酸性孔内进行耦合。这一过程促进了轻烯烃的产生，如通过同步辐射基真空紫外光电离质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）检测到酮烯离子在排放流中的出现所证实的那样。
