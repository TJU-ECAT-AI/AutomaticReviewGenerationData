<p>The conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid fuels or chemicals often proceeds through the production of CO and H2. This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.</p>
<p>For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup.</p>
<p>Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong).</p>
<p>A zinc-chromium oxide creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite.</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>This composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.</p>
<p>CO and H2 are activated over a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) surface, whereas CC coupling is controlled within the confined environment of zeolite pores with acidic sites.</p>
<p>The partially reduced oxide in activating CO but incapability of catalyzing surface polymerization of CHx makes it possible to manipulate CC coupling with confined acidic zeolite pores.</p>
<p>The CO conversion and selectivity can be tuned at the same time - CO conversion is manipulated via the surface structure of the oxides and the ratio of oxides/zeolite, whereas the olefin selectivity is controlled by the properties of zeolites, particularly the pore structure and acidity.</p>

The bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al. utilizes a zinc-chromium oxide to create ketene intermediates, which are then coupled over a zeolite. This catalyst avoids deactivation and allows for higher conversions of syngas to hydrocarbons, particularly light olefins, with minimal carbon buildup. The catalyst's components, a partially reduced oxide surface and a zeolite with acidic sites, enable precise control over carbon-carbon coupling, allowing for selective formation of light olefins. The catalyst can be tuned for CO conversion and selectivity by adjusting the oxide's surface structure and its ratio to the zeolite. The zeolite's pore structure and acidity are crucial in controlling olefin selectivity. This bifunctional catalyst enables the utilization of syngas derived from coal and biomass with a low hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio.
