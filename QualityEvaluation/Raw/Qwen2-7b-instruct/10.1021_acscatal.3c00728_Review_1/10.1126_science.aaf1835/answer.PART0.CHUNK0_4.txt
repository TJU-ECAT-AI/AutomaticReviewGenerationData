[1] "This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties."
[2] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
[3] "In the absence of MSAPO (corresponding to Mode 1 of Fig. 2A), syngas was converted mainly to CH4 (selectivity 53%), and selectivity to C2C4 hydrocarbons was only 38% over ZnCrOx."
[4] "In the presence of ZnCrOx, a signal of mass/charge ratio (m/z) = 42.01 appeared in the effluents at a photon energy hυ = 9.72 eV (Fig. 2D) in addition to stable hydrocarbon products."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in the bifunctional catalyst are crucial for the selective conversion of syngas to light olefins. The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, while the confined acidic pores of zeolites manipulate CC coupling. This dual-site system ensures both CO conversion and selectivity control, allowing for the production of light olefins with high selectivity and minimal methane formation.

When the catalyst lacks the mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO), the conversion primarily yields methane, with a lower selectivity for C2C4 hydrocarbons compared to the presence of MSAPO. The zeolite component, specifically its acidic sites, plays a critical role in controlling the CC coupling, enabling the selective formation of olefins.

In the presence of ZnCrOx, ketene intermediates are formed, which are then coupled within the confined acidic pores of the zeolite. This process facilitates the production of light olefins, as demonstrated by the detection of ketene ions in the effluents using synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS).

在双功能催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度对于选择性地将合成气转化为轻烯烃至关重要。部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）激活CO和H2，而沸石的酸性孔内控制CC耦合。这种双活性位系统确保了CO转化和选择性的控制，允许以高选择性和最小的甲烷形成生产轻烯烃。

当催化剂缺乏微孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）时，主要的转换产生甲烷，与MSAPO存在相比，C2C4烃类的选择性较低。沸石组分，尤其是其酸性位点，在控制CC耦合方面起着关键作用，使轻烯烃的选择性形成成为可能。

在ZnCrOx的存在下，形成了酮烯中间体，然后在沸石的限定酸性孔内进行耦合。这一过程促进了轻烯烃的产生，如通过同步辐射基真空紫外光电离质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）检测到酮烯离子在排放流中的出现所证实的那样。
