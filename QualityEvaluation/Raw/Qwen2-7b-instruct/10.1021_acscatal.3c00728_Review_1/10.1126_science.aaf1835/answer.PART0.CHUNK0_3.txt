<p>However, application of this technology is still limited by low olefin selectivity and high methane selectivity, as well as severe carbon deposition.</p>
<p>It can be described by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model (7, 8), which predicts that selectivity of C2 to C4 hydrocarbons (C2C4), including C2=C4= olefins and C2oC4o paraffins, does not exceed 58% (6).</p>
<p>No obvious deactivation is observed within 110 hours.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C).</p>
<p>The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat.</p>
<p>CH2 species are very active and readily react with CO in the presence of CO, forming a relatively less reactive ketene (26, 27), which is detectable by SVUV-PIMS.</p>
<p>In contrast, a commercially available SAPO-34 exhibiting NH3 desorption at 394C had a C2=C4= selectivity of 43% and an olefin/paraffin ratio (C2=C4=/C2oC4o) of 0.9.</p>
<p>Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there may exist an optimum acidity with NH3 desorption temperature <350C for olefin formation.</p>

The bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al. achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation in the conversion of syngas to light olefins. It uses a zinc-chromium oxide to create ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite. The process reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at a CO conversion of 17%. This is enabled by a composite catalyst that contains two types of active sites with complementary properties, allowing for precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation. The catalyst maintains stable performance over 110 hours, with no obvious deactivation. The composite catalyst and process may allow the use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio. The catalyst's bifunctionality and the unique properties of the active sites contribute to its efficiency and selectivity in converting syngas to light olefins.

焦等人开发的双功能催化剂在将合成气转化为轻烯烃方面实现了更高的转化率并避免了失活。它使用锌铬氧化物产生酮烯中间体，然后在沸石孔内的酸性环境中进行耦合。该过程的C2=C4=选择性高达80%，C2C4选择性高达94%，CO转化率为17%。这得益于复合催化剂中两种具有互补性质的活性位点，允许精确控制CC耦合并抑制过氢化和甲烷生成。催化剂在110小时内保持稳定性能，未观察到明显的失活现象。该复合催化剂和工艺可能允许使用煤炭和生物质衍生的合成气，其H2/CO比低。催化剂的双功能性和活性位点的独特性质有助于其在将合成气转化为轻烯烃方面的效率和选择性。
