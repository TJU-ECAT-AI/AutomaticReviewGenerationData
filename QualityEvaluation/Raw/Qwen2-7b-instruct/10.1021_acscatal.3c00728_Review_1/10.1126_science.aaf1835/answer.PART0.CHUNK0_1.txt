[1] "We present a process that reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of 17%."
[2] "This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties."
[3] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) activates CO and H2, and CC coupling is subsequently manipulated within the confined acidic pores of zeolites."
[4] "Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C). The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat."

The bifunctional catalyst utilized in the process achieves a high C2=C4= selectivity of up to 80% and a total C2C4 selectivity of 94% at a CO conversion rate of 17%. This is accomplished through the use of two complementary active sites. One site, the partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx), activates CO and H2, while the other, confined within the acidic pores of zeolites, manipulates CC coupling. The catalyst demonstrates excellent stability, maintaining a total C2C4 selectivity of over 90% and a C2=C4= selectivity of 78% during a 110-hour test under specific conditions.

该双功能催化剂在17%的CO转化率下，实现了高达80%的C2=C4=选择性和94%的总C2C4选择性。这是通过使用两种互补的活性位点实现的。一个位点是部分还原的氧化物表面（ZnCrOx），激活CO和H2；另一个则位于酸性孔道内的沸石中，控制CC耦合。该催化剂表现出极好的稳定性，在特定条件下进行110小时测试时，总C2C4选择性保持在超过90%，C2=C4=选择性为78%。
