Here, we developed a unique approach to control the opening direction of bowl-like structures via self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening. The opening size can be adjusted by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives that is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure. Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. By controlling the opening direction and size of bowl-like structures through the self-assembly strategy, the catalysts achieve a precise control over the pressure differential between large and small bubbles. This leads to the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency in converting propane to propene and removing organic pollutants. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts optimized for commercial applications.
