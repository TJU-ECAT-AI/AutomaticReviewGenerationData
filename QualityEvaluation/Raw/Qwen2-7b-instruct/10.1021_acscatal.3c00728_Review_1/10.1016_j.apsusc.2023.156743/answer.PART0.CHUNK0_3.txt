The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The synthesized BN-based monolithic foam exhibits a directional bowl-like structure, offering a double layer with face-to-face openings. The foam's enhanced gas trapping capacity facilitates precise control over the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, which is crucial for the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. At higher temperatures, the pure h-BN monolithic foam achieves a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, demonstrating superior performance in catalytic ODHP reactions and organic pollutant removal.
