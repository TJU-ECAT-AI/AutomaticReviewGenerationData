[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."
[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
[3] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the orientation of bowl-like structures in the catalysts allows for precise control over the opening size, which enhances the gas trapping capacity and thus promotes the oriented opening of bowl-like structures. This results in a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, leading to superior performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，尤其是1-D边活性位点，对于设计更高效的商用催化剂具有重要意义。例如，催化剂中碗状结构的定向可以精确控制开口大小，增强气体捕获能力，从而促进碗状结构的定向打开。这导致多模层次孔结构的形成，进而表现出催化氧化脱氢将丙烷转化为丙烯以及有机污染物去除的优异性能。
