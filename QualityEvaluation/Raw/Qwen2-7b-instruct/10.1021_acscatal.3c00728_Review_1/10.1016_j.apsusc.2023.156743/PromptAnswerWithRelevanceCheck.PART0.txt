1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, especially focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These 1-D edge sites offer enhanced reactivity due to their specific geometry, which facilitates better interaction with reactants. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, aiming for optimized selectivity and yield in the ODHP process.

2. The dimensionalities of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing their efficiency in ODHP reactions. The presence of 1-D edge active sites allows for a higher density of reactive sites, increasing the rate of reaction. Moreover, these sites enable better diffusion of reactants and products, leading to improved catalytic performance. The research demonstrates that by controlling the opening direction and dimensionality of bowl-like structures, one can tailor the active sites' properties, thereby optimizing the catalyst's performance in both ODHP and organic pollutant removal.

3. The research introduces an innovative method for creating BN-based bowl monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structures. This foam possesses a unique multimodal hierarchical porous structure, which significantly enhances its catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants. The foam's design, based on the extended assembly interface strategy, ensures precise control over the bowl-like structures' orientation, facilitating optimal performance in various applications.

4. The synthesized BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam exhibits a double layer structure with face-to-face opening, providing a controlled environment for the formation of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The foam's ability to trap gases effectively helps in managing the pressure differential between large and small bubbles, thus favoring the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure. This feature is essential for the efficient execution of the ODHP reaction and the removal of organic pollutants.

5. The study highlights the importance of an extended assembly interface strategy for the development of oriented bowl-like structure materials. By employing this approach, researchers can create catalysts tailored for different applications, including catalytic reactions and environmental remediation. This strategy enables the precise control of structure and composition, leading to enhanced performance and broader applicability of the materials.

Here, we developed a unique approach to control the opening direction of bowl-like structures via self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening. The opening size can be adjusted by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives that is beneficial for the production of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure. Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants.
