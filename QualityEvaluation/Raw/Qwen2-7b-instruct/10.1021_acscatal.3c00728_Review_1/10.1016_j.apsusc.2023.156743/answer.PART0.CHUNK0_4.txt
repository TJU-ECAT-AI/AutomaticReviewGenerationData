[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."
[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."
[3] "The as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."
[4] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the catalytic process. By controlling the orientation and dimensionality of these sites through the self-assembly strategy described in the research, the catalysts can achieve precise control over the pressure differential between large and small bubbles. This results in optimized gas trapping capacity and the formation of bowl-like structures, which are beneficial for the ODHP reaction. Moreover, the multimodal hierarchically porous structure of the h-BN monolithic foam at higher temperatures demonstrates superior performance in both the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants, highlighting the importance of active site design for enhanced catalyst efficiency.
