The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a critical role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites enables the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. In the context of this study, the Zn templating strategy effectively constructs porous boron nitride with high surface areas, up to 1579 m2/g, and generates abundant artificial N-terminated edges. The moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on these N-terminated edges is the primary reason for the enhanced catalytic activity observed in the aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds. The DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the N-terminated edges serve as the active sites, contributing significantly to the catalyst's performance. This research not only provides a strategy for constructing porous materials but also offers a pathway for designing highly active boron nitride catalysts.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对它们的性能至关重要。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商用催化剂。在本研究中，Zn模板策略有效地构建了具有高达1579 m2/g的大比表面积的多孔氮化硼，并生成了大量的人工N-末端边缘。氧原子在这些N-末端边缘上的适度解离能是观察到的增强催化活性的主要原因。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和实验结果证实，N-末端边缘作为活性位点起着关键作用，极大地促进了芳香硫化合物的有氧氧化。以上结论不仅为构建多孔材料提供了一种策略，也为设计高效氮化硼催化剂开辟了途径。
