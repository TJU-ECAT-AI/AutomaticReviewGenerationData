[1] "The Zn salt was proved to be a dual-functional template. It not only could function as a template and a physical spacer for the construction of porous boron nitride with SSAs up to 1579 m2 g1, but also acted as a synthesis-directing agent that generated abundant artificial N-terminated pores."
[2] "Moreover, because of the lower electronegativity of Zn, boron (B) atoms are partly replaced by Zn atoms and ultimately preferred to N-terminated edges with the volatilization of Zn NPs."
[3] "Owing to the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges, the N-terminated edges are proved to be the origin of an enhanced aerobic catalytic activity by density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[4] "DFT calculation result is experimentally verified."
[5] "With this strategy, artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a rather high SSA of up to 1579 m2 g1 were obtained (the fabrication procedure of N-terminated P-BN and intermediate/final products are schematically presented in Figure 1a)."
[6] "The preferential N-terminated edges proved to be active sites for the activation of oxygen in aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds, via both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The design of efficient catalysts for commercial applications relies on understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites. The Zn salt plays a dual role in this context: it acts as a template and physical spacer for constructing porous boron nitride with a high surface area, and it also serves as a synthesis-directing agent that generates abundant artificial N-terminated pores. The substitution of boron (B) atoms by zinc (Zn) atoms leads to the formation of N-terminated edges, which exhibit moderate dissociative energy for oxygen atoms. This characteristic makes the N-terminated edges the active sites responsible for the enhanced aerobic catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these N-terminated edges is experimentally verified through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration methods.

活性位点的空间分布和维度在硼基催化剂中对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。设计商业应用中的高效催化剂依赖于理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是关注一维边缘活性位点。锌盐在此过程中扮演着双重角色：它既可以作为模板和物理间隔物来构建具有高比表面积的多孔硼氮化物，也可以作为合成导向剂生成大量的人工N-终止孔。通过将硼（B）原子替换为锌（Zn）原子，形成了N-终止边缘，这些边缘显示出氧原子的适度解离能。这种特性使得N-终止边缘成为增强有氧催化活性的活性位点。N-终止边缘的有效性通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和化学滴定方法得到实验验证。
