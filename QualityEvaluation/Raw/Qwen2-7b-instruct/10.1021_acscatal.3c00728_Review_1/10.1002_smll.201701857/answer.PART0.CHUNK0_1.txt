[1] "The most important progress in this area is the recent work reported by Hermans and co-workers.[3] They found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[2] "For generating abundant active sites, an agent-assisted synthesis is an efficient strategy to achieve this target,5 but such a strategy has not been reported in the field of h-BN catalysts."
[3] "What's more, for different catalytic systems, the catalytically active sites may be diverse."
[4] "Moreover, because of the lower electronegativity of Zn, boron (B) atoms are partly replaced by Zn atoms and ultimately preferred to N-terminated edges with the volatilization of Zn NPs."
[5] "Owing to the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges, the N-terminated edges are proved to be the origin of an enhanced aerobic catalytic activity by density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[6] "Moreover, the DFT calculation result is experimentally verified."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The document highlights that the commercially available hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) functions as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, demonstrating catalytic activity and selectivity comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts. It also emphasizes the importance of generating abundant active sites through agent-assisted synthesis, a strategy previously unexplored in the field of h-BN catalysts. Different catalytic systems may have distinct active sites, and the document introduces a novel strategy using zinc (Zn) as a dual-functional template to construct porous boron nitride with high surface areas and abundant artificial N-terminated edges. This results in enhanced aerobic catalytic activity, mainly originating from the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges, as confirmed by both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental verification.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其性能。理解这些位点的独特属性和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商用催化剂贡献巨大。文档指出，商业化的六方硼氮化物（h-BN）作为丙烷氧化脱氢化催化剂的功能效率高，催化活性和选择性甚至与工业支持的钒氧化物催化剂相当。它还强调了生成大量活性位点的必要性，即通过助剂辅助合成策略，这一策略在h-BN催化剂领域之前未曾报道过。不同的催化系统可能具有不同的活性位点，并且文档引入了一种使用锌（Zn）作为双功能模板来构建具有高比表面积和大量人工N-终止边缘的多孔硼氮化物的新策略。这导致了增强的有氧催化活性，主要来源于氧原子在N-终止边缘上的适度离解能，这一结果得到了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和实验验证的支持。
