[1] "With the presence of relatively high temperature and reducing gases, the Zn salt turned to Zn nanoparticles (Zn NPs), which functioned as physical spacers during the formation process of P-BN."
[2] "Moreover, because of the lower electronegativity of Zn, boron (B) atoms are partly replaced by Zn atoms and ultimately preferred to N-terminated edges with the volatilization of Zn NPs."
[3] "A key point is the clarification of the catalytic active sites to achieve such a goal."
[4] "For generating abundant active sites, an agent-assisted synthesis is an efficient strategy to achieve this target,5 but such a strategy has not been reported in the field of h-BN catalysts."
[5] "Moreover, the DFT calculation result is experimentally verified."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites are crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites enables the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. In the context of the literature, the unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, particularly those with N-termination, are highlighted as a key factor contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance observed in the synthesized porous boron nitride catalyst. This finding underscores the importance of precisely engineered active sites for improving the efficiency of B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.

[1] "The most important progress in this area is the recent work reported by Hermans and co-workers.[3] They found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[2] "For generating abundant active sites, an agent-assisted synthesis is an efficient strategy to achieve this target,5 but such a strategy has not been reported in the field of h-BN catalysts."
[3] "What's more, for different catalytic systems, the catalytically active sites may be diverse."
[4] "Moreover, because of the lower electronegativity of Zn, boron (B) atoms are partly replaced by Zn atoms and ultimately preferred to N-terminated edges with the volatilization of Zn NPs."
[5] "Owing to the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges, the N-terminated edges are proved to be the origin of an enhanced aerobic catalytic activity by density functional theory (DFT) calculations."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The document highlights that the commercially available hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) functions as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, demonstrating catalytic activity and selectivity comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts. It also emphasizes the importance of generating abundant active sites through agent-assisted synthesis, a strategy previously unexplored in the field of h-BN catalysts. Different catalytic systems may have distinct active sites, and the document introduces a novel strategy using zinc (Zn) as a dual-functional template to construct porous boron nitride with high surface areas and abundant artificial N-terminated edges. This results in enhanced aerobic catalytic activity, mainly originating from the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges, as confirmed by both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental verification.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其性能。理解这些位点的独特属性和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商用催化剂贡献巨大。文档指出，商业化的六方硼氮化物（h-BN）作为丙烷氧化脱氢化催化剂的功能效率高，催化活性和选择性甚至与工业支持的钒氧化物催化剂相当。它还强调了生成大量活性位点的必要性，即通过助剂辅助合成策略，这一策略在h-BN催化剂领域之前未曾报道过。不同的催化系统可能具有不同的活性位点，并且文档引入了一种使用锌（Zn）作为双功能模板来构建具有高比表面积和大量人工N-终止边缘的多孔硼氮化物的新策略。这导致了增强的有氧催化活性，主要来源于氧原子在N-终止边缘上的适度离解能，这一结果得到了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和实验验证的支持。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The design of efficient catalysts for commercial applications relies on understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites. The Zn salt plays a dual role in this context: it acts as a template and physical spacer for constructing porous boron nitride with a high surface area, and it also serves as a synthesis-directing agent that generates abundant artificial N-terminated pores. The substitution of boron (B) atoms by zinc (Zn) atoms leads to the formation of N-terminated edges, which exhibit moderate dissociative energy for oxygen atoms. This characteristic makes the N-terminated edges the active sites responsible for the enhanced aerobic catalytic activity. The effectiveness of these N-terminated edges is experimentally verified through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration methods.

活性位点的空间分布和维度在硼基催化剂中对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。设计商业应用中的高效催化剂依赖于理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是关注一维边缘活性位点。锌盐在此过程中扮演着双重角色：它既可以作为模板和物理间隔物来构建具有高比表面积的多孔硼氮化物，也可以作为合成导向剂生成大量的人工N-终止孔。通过将硼（B）原子替换为锌（Zn）原子，形成了N-终止边缘，这些边缘显示出氧原子的适度解离能。这种特性使得N-终止边缘成为增强有氧催化活性的活性位点。N-终止边缘的有效性通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和化学滴定方法得到实验验证。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a critical role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites enables the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. In the context of this study, the Zn templating strategy effectively constructs porous boron nitride with high surface areas, up to 1579 m2/g, and generates abundant artificial N-terminated edges. The moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on these N-terminated edges is the primary reason for the enhanced catalytic activity observed in the aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds. The DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the N-terminated edges serve as the active sites, contributing significantly to the catalyst's performance. This research not only provides a strategy for constructing porous materials but also offers a pathway for designing highly active boron nitride catalysts.
