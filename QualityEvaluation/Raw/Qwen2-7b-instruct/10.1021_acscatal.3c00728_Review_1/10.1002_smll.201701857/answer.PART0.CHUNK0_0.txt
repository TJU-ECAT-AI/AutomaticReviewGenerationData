[1] "With the presence of relatively high temperature and reducing gases, the Zn salt turned to Zn nanoparticles (Zn NPs), which functioned as physical spacers during the formation process of P-BN."
[2] "Moreover, because of the lower electronegativity of Zn, boron (B) atoms are partly replaced by Zn atoms and ultimately preferred to N-terminated edges with the volatilization of Zn NPs."
[3] "A key point is the clarification of the catalytic active sites to achieve such a goal."
[4] "For generating abundant active sites, an agent-assisted synthesis is an efficient strategy to achieve this target,5 but such a strategy has not been reported in the field of h-BN catalysts."
[5] "Moreover, the DFT calculation result is experimentally verified."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites are crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites enables the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. In the context of the literature, the unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, particularly those with N-termination, are highlighted as a key factor contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance observed in the synthesized porous boron nitride catalyst. This finding underscores the importance of precisely engineered active sites for improving the efficiency of B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.
