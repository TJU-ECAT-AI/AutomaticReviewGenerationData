[1] "The discovery of its activating ability to oxygen molecules revolutionized its applications."
[2] "However, no synthetic strategy toward active sites in h-BN catalysts was proposed in the above and other related works."
[3] "What's more, for different catalytic systems, the catalytically active sites may be diverse."
[4] "Moreover, because of the lower electronegativity of Zn, boron (B) atoms are partly replaced by Zn atoms and ultimately preferred to N-terminated edges with the volatilization of Zn NPs."
[5] "DFT calculation result is experimentally verified."
[6] "The Zn salt was proved to be a dual-functional template."
[7] "The Zn salt not only could function as a template and a physical spacer for the construction of porous boron nitride with SSAs up to 1579 m2 g1, but also acted as a synthesis-directing agent that generated abundant artificial N-terminated pores."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The study demonstrated that the boron nitride catalysts with porous structures, fabricated through a Zn templating strategy, exhibited superior catalytic performance in aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds. The DFT calculations suggested that the enhanced catalytic activity originated from the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges. The experimental results corroborated the DFT findings, highlighting the importance of these edge sites in catalysis.

在氧化脱氢反应中，B基催化剂中的活性位点的空间分布和维度（特别是1-D边缘活性位点），对其性能至关重要。理解这些位点的独特特性和反应机制对设计更高效的商用催化剂具有重大贡献。研究证明，通过锌模板策略制备的具有多孔结构的硼氮化物催化剂，在芳香硫化合物的有氧氧化反应中表现出优越的催化性能。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，增强的催化活性来源于氧原子在N-末端边缘上的适度解离能。实验结果验证了DFT结果，强调了这些边缘位点在催化中的重要性。
