The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts. In the context of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films, the use of unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a catalytic seed layer prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This results in an h-BN thin film that is atomically flat and comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN, demonstrating the importance of 1-D edge active sites in enhancing the quality and performance of the synthesized materials.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，显著影响其性能。理解这些位点的独特属性和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂。在六方氮化硼（h-BN）薄膜的背景下，通过将意外形成的纳米晶状石墨烯（nc-G）用作催化种子层，可以防止化学气相沉积（CVD）过程中结构变形。由此产生的h-BN薄膜原子级平坦且无结构变形，与剥离的单晶h-BN相当，这表明1-D边缘活性位点在增强合成材料的质量和性能方面的重要性。
