[1] "A wafer-scale dielectric h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate by assistance of nc-G to prevent structural deformations in the CVD process."
[2] "On the other hand, uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under the equivalent growth conditions, indicating that the sp3 edges of nc-G played a key role in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The quote provided highlights the role of nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a catalyst seed layer that enables the synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, preventing structural deformations during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. This demonstrates the importance of specific active site characteristics in catalysts for achieving optimal performance in targeted chemical reactions.

[1] "The growth mechanism of this nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film was systematically analyzed."
[2] "This approach provides a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface."
[3] "The sp3 edges of nc-G play a key role in the initiation and lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without any help of metal catalysts."
[4] "On the other hand, uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under the equivalent growth conditions, indicating that the sp3 edges of nc-G played a key role in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer."

1. The systematic analysis of the growth mechanism for the nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film reveals a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface. The sp3 edges of nc-G are crucial for initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without the need for a metal catalyst.

2. The key role of the sp3 edges of nc-G in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer explains why uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions. This highlights the importance of the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in catalyst performance.

1. 对这种nc-G调整后的h-BN薄膜生长机制的系统分析揭示了一种在大面积上制备高质量二维材料的新方法。nc-G的sp3边缘对于在nc-G层上启动和促进h-BN的横向生长至关重要，无需使用金属催化剂。

2. nc-G的sp3边缘在粗糙的nc-G层上形成原子平滑表面的h-BN的关键作用解释了为什么在等效生长条件下，在单层石墨烯转移的c-Al2O3基板上不会形成均匀的平滑h-BN。这强调了1-D边缘活性位点的独特属性和反应机制在催化剂性能中的重要性。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts. In the context of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films, the use of unintentionally formed nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a catalytic seed layer prevents structural deformations during chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This results in an h-BN thin film that is atomically flat and comparable to exfoliated single-crystal h-BN, demonstrating the importance of 1-D edge active sites in enhancing the quality and performance of the synthesized materials.

在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中，B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，显著影响其性能。理解这些位点的独特属性和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂。在六方氮化硼（h-BN）薄膜的背景下，通过将意外形成的纳米晶状石墨烯（nc-G）用作催化种子层，可以防止化学气相沉积（CVD）过程中结构变形。由此产生的h-BN薄膜原子级平坦且无结构变形，与剥离的单晶h-BN相当，这表明1-D边缘活性位点在增强合成材料的质量和性能方面的重要性。
