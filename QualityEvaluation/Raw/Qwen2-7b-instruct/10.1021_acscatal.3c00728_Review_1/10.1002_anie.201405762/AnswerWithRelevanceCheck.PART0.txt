          [1] "A wafer-scale dielectric h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate by assistance of nc-G to prevent structural deformations in the CVD process."
          [2] "On the other hand, uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under the equivalent growth conditions, indicating that the sp3 edges of nc-G played a key role in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The quote provided highlights the role of nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a catalyst seed layer that enables the synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, preventing structural deformations during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.

          [1] "The growth mechanism of this nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film was systematically analyzed."
          [2] "This approach provides a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface."
          [3] "The sp3 edges of nc-G play a key role in the initiation and lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without any help of metal catalysts."
          [4] "On the other hand, uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under the equivalent growth conditions, indicating that the sp3 edges of nc-G played a key role in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer."

          1. The systematic analysis of the growth mechanism for the nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film reveals a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface. The sp3 edges of nc-G are crucial for initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without the need for a metal catalyst.
      
          2. The key role of the sp3 edges of nc-G in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer explains why uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions. This highlights the importance of the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in catalyst performance.

          1. 对这种nc-G调整后的h-BN薄膜生长机制的系统分析揭示了一种在大面积上制备高质量二维材料的新方法。nc-G的sp3边缘对于在nc-G层上启动和促进h-BN的横向生长至关重要，无需使用金属催化剂。
      
          2. nc-G的sp3边缘在粗糙的nc-G层上形成原子平滑表面的h-BN的关键作用解释了为什么在等效生长条件下，在单层石墨烯转移的c-Al2O3基板上不会形成均匀的平滑h-BN。这强调了1-D边缘活性位点的独特属性和反应机制在催化剂性能中的重要性。
