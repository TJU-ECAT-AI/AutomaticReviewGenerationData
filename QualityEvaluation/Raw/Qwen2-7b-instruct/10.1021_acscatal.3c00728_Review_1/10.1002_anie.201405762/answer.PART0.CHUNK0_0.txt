[1] "A wafer-scale dielectric h-BN thin film was successfully synthesized on a bare c-Al2O3 substrate by assistance of nc-G to prevent structural deformations in the CVD process."
[2] "On the other hand, uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under the equivalent growth conditions, indicating that the sp3 edges of nc-G played a key role in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The quote provided highlights the role of nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a catalyst seed layer that enables the synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films with atomically flat surfaces, preventing structural deformations during the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. This demonstrates the importance of specific active site characteristics in catalysts for achieving optimal performance in targeted chemical reactions.
