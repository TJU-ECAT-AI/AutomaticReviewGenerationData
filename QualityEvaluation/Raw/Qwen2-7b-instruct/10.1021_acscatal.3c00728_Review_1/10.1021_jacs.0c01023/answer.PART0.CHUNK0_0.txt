The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts play a significant role in their performance during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of one-dimensional (1-D) edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
