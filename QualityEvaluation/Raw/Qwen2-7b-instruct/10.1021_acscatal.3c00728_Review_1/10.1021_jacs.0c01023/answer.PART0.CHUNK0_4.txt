Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, especially focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influences their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. This is because the unique properties and reaction mechanisms associated with these sites enable more efficient catalytic activity. By recognizing how these active sites function within the spherical superstructure of boron nitride nanosheets derived from boron-containing metalorganic frameworks, researchers can design catalysts that are optimized for commercial applications.
