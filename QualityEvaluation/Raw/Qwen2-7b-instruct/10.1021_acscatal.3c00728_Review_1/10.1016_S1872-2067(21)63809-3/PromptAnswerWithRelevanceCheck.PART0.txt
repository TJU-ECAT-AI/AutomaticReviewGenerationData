Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts contributes significantly to their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1-D nanofibrous structure of the porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) synthesized via electrospinning facilitates easy diffusion, ensuring high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocities (WHSV). This unique structure prevents diffusion limitations, which is a common issue in higher-dimensional catalysts. Moreover, PBSNs display superior olefin selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, enhancing their efficiency in ODHP reactions. The presence of SiOH groups on silica-supported boron catalysts negatively impacts propylene selectivity, suggesting that the absence of these groups in the PBSN catalyst may be responsible for its higher propylene selectivity. This unique property, combined with the stability of the 1-D edge active sites, makes PBSNs an attractive candidate for commercial applications in ODHP reactions.
