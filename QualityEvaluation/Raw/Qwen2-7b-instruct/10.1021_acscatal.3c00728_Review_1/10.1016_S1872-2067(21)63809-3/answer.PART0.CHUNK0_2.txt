The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly in 1-D structures like the porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) synthesized via electrospinning, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework provided by electrospinning ensure high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The 1-D structure of the PBSN catalysts prevents diffusion limitations, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocities (WHSV). Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, the PBSN catalysts exhibit enhanced olefin selectivity and stability. This unique combination of properties enables a better understanding of the reaction pathways over boron-based catalysts and contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是通过静电纺丝合成的多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSN）中的1-D结构，显著影响其丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应性能。静电纺丝在开放硅酸纤维框架上均匀分散并稳定硼物种，确保了高活性和选择性。1-D结构的PBSN催化剂避免了扩散限制，从而在高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下保证了高催化活性。与其它支持的硼氧化物催化剂相比，PBSN催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性。这种独特的性质组合有助于更好地理解硼基催化剂的反应途径，并为商业应用设计更高效的催化剂提供了贡献。
