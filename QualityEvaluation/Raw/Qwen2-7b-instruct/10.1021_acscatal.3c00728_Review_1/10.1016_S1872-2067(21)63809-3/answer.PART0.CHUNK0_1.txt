Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts contributes significantly to their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The 1-D nanofibrous structure of the porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) synthesized via electrospinning facilitates easy diffusion, ensuring high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocities (WHSV). This unique structure prevents diffusion limitations, which is a common issue in higher-dimensional catalysts. Moreover, PBSNs display superior olefin selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, enhancing their efficiency in ODHP reactions. The presence of SiOH groups on silica-supported boron catalysts negatively impacts propylene selectivity, suggesting that the absence of these groups in the PBSN catalyst may be responsible for its higher propylene selectivity. This unique property, combined with the stability of the 1-D edge active sites, makes PBSNs an attractive candidate for commercial applications in ODHP reactions.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中，理解硼基催化剂中1-D边活性位点的独特性质和反应机制对催化剂的性能具有重要意义。通过静电纺丝合成的多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSNs）的1-D纳米纤维结构能够促进容易扩散，即使在高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下也能确保高催化活性。这种独特的结构可以防止扩散限制，这是更高维催化剂常见的问题。此外，PBSNs在ODHP反应中的烯烃选择性和稳定性均优于其他支持型硼氧化物催化剂，从而提高了其效率。在二氧化硅支持的硼催化剂上存在的SiOH基团会降低丙烯选择性，这表明PBSN催化剂中缺乏这些基团可能是其较高丙烯选择性的原因。这种独特特性与1-D边活性位点的稳定性相结合，使PBSNs成为ODHP反应中具有吸引力的候选材料。
