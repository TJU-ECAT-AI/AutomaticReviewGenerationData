Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influences their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge sites enable facile diffusion and high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODHP process. This not only enhances olefin selectivity but also improves catalyst stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts tends to reduce propylene selectivity during the ODHP reaction. The open 1-D fiber structure of the synthesized catalysts facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products, ensuring high catalytic activity at high WHSV. This unique property contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by optimizing the spatial arrangement and dimensionality of active sites.

理解B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是关注1-D边缘活性位点，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能有着显著影响。这些1-D边缘位点的独特性质和反应机制允许容易的扩散，并在高重量小时空间速度（WHSV）下确保高催化活性。这不仅增强了烯烃选择性，也提高了催化剂稳定性，与其它支持型硼氧化物催化剂相比。在硅酸盐支持的硼催化剂中，SiOH基团的存在倾向于降低丙烯选择性。合成催化剂的开放1-D纤维结构促进了反应物和产物的扩散，确保了高WHSV下的高催化活性。这一独特的特性有助于商业应用中设计更高效的催化剂，通过优化活性位点的空间排列和维度。
