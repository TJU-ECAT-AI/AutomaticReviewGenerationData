Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influences their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable efficient diffusion pathways and enhance catalytic activity, especially at high weight hourly space velocities (WHSV). The presence of SiOH groups on silica surfaces can negatively impact propylene selectivity. The electrospun PBSN catalysts demonstrate superior olefin selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts. The open one-dimensional structure facilitates facile diffusion and ensures high catalytic activity under high WHSV conditions. Kinetic experiments reveal that molecular oxygen dissociates on the surface of the catalyst, influencing its activation. The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites provide insights into designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
