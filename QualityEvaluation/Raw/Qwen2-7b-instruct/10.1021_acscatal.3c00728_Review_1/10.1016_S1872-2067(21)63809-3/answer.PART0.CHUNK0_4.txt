1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contribute to enhanced olefin selectivity and stability. Understanding these aspects enables the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

2. The dimensionality and spatial distribution of active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity of B-based catalysts during the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This is evidenced by the higher olefin selectivity and stability observed in porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) catalysts compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts. The open one-dimensional fiber structure of the PBSN catalyst facilitates easy diffusion and maintains high catalytic activity even at high weight hourly space velocities (WHSV).

3. The performance of B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions is also influenced by the reaction dynamics of oxygen activation. Transient analysis and kinetic experiments reveal that the activation of molecular oxygen is affected by the presence of alkanes. This finding underscores the importance of considering the interaction between reactants and catalysts in optimizing the efficiency of B-based catalysts for commercial applications.

4. The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts, combined with the optimized structure of porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN), enable these catalysts to exhibit superior performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The ability to maintain high catalytic activity at high WHSV, along with enhanced olefin selectivity and stability, makes PBSN catalysts a promising candidate for commercial applications in the production of light olefins from propane and ethane.
