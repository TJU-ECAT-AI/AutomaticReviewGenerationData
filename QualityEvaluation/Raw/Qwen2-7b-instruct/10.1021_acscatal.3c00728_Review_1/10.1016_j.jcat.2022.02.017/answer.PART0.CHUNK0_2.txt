"Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
"A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."
"Meanwhile, the ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."
"During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity."
"The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."

This study demonstrates that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the research highlights the importance of boron species being anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form. This arrangement facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds with surface SiOH groups, which inhibits boron leaching and enhances stability. Moreover, during the reaction, isolated boron species transform into aggregated forms, which are associated with increased catalytic activity. These aggregated boron species, characterized by BOH groups that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups, are identified as the active center for efficient catalysis at low temperatures. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, optimizing both activity and selectivity in ODHP processes.

本研究表明，硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应性能有显著影响。具体而言，研究表明硼物种被锚定在沸石矩阵中的开放配位形式对于提高催化性能至关重要。这种排列方式促进了表面SiOH基团形成的氢键，抑制了硼的流失并增强了稳定性。此外，在反应过程中，孤立的硼物种会转化为聚合形式，这与增强的催化活性紧密相关。这些聚合硼物种，其特征是能够与相邻的SiOH基团形成氢键的BOH基团，被识别为在低温下高效催化反应的活性中心。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制使得设计更高效的催化剂成为可能，优化了ODHP过程中的活性和选择性，从而适用于商业应用。
