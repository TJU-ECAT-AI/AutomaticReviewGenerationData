[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."
[2] "The structure and coordination environment of boron species were studied by combining with the solid-state NMR and FTIR measurements."
[3] "The catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Meanwhile, the ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."
[5] "During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity."
[6] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in their performance during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. In particular, understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. These sites, characterized by their ability to dynamically transform from isolated to aggregated forms, exhibit enhanced catalytic activity due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between BOH groups in aggregated BOx species and adjacent SiOH groups. This mechanism facilitates a high efficiency in catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperatures, thereby improving the overall performance of B-based catalysts in this process.

活性位点的空间分布和维度对基于B的催化剂在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中的性能起着关键作用。特别是，了解1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，对于设计更高效的催化剂以满足商业应用需求具有重要意义。这些位点的特点是从孤立到聚合的动态转变，显示出增强的催化活性，这是由于聚合BOx物种中的BOH基团与相邻的SiOH基团形成氢键所导致的。这一机制在低温下高效催化ODHP反应中发挥了重要作用，从而提高了基于B的催化剂在此过程中的整体性能。
