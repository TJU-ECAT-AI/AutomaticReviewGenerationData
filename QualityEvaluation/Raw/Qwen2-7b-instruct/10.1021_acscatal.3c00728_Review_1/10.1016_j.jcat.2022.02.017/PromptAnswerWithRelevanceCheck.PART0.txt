This study demonstrates that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the research highlights the importance of boron species being anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form. This arrangement facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds with surface SiOH groups, which inhibits boron leaching and enhances stability. Moreover, during the reaction, isolated boron species transform into aggregated forms, which are associated with increased catalytic activity. These aggregated boron species, characterized by BOH groups that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups, are identified as the active center for efficient catalysis at low temperatures. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, optimizing both activity and selectivity in ODHP processes.

1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the presence of 1-D edge active sites plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic efficiency. These sites, when properly anchored within the zeolite matrix through open coordination, allow for efficient hydrogen bonding with boron species. This interaction not only stabilizes the boron species but also inhibits their excessive leaching, thereby maintaining the integrity and activity of the catalyst. Moreover, the dynamic transformation of isolated boron species into aggregated forms during the ODHP process leads to increased catalytic activity, indicating the importance of boron aggregation for optimal performance.

2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these active sites, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By elucidating the role of boron coordination, hydrogen bonding capabilities, and the effect of boron aggregation, researchers can engineer catalysts with enhanced stability and activity, leading to improved efficiency and selectivity in ODHP reactions. This knowledge can guide the development of novel catalyst architectures that optimize the spatial arrangement and connectivity of boron species, potentially leading to the creation of catalysts with superior performance characteristics for industrial use.
