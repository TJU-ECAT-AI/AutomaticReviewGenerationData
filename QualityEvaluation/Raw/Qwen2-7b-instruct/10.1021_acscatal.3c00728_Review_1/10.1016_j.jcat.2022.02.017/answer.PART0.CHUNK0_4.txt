1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the presence of 1-D edge active sites plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic efficiency. These sites, when properly anchored within the zeolite matrix through open coordination, allow for efficient hydrogen bonding with boron species. This interaction not only stabilizes the boron species but also inhibits their excessive leaching, thereby maintaining the integrity and activity of the catalyst. Moreover, the dynamic transformation of isolated boron species into aggregated forms during the ODHP process leads to increased catalytic activity, indicating the importance of boron aggregation for optimal performance.

2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these active sites, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By elucidating the role of boron coordination, hydrogen bonding capabilities, and the effect of boron aggregation, researchers can engineer catalysts with enhanced stability and activity, leading to improved efficiency and selectivity in ODHP reactions. This knowledge can guide the development of novel catalyst architectures that optimize the spatial arrangement and connectivity of boron species, potentially leading to the creation of catalysts with superior performance characteristics for industrial use.

1. 催化剂中硼基活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。特别是，1-D 边缘活性位点在增强催化效率方面起着关键作用。当这些位点通过开放配位牢固地锚定在沸石晶格内时，它们能够高效地与硼物种形成氢键。这种相互作用不仅稳定了硼物种，还抑制了它们的过度流失，从而保持催化剂的完整性和活性。此外，在ODHP过程中，孤立的硼物种动态转化为聚合物形式，这与催化剂活性的增加密切相关，表明聚合硼物种对于最佳性能至关重要。

2. 理解这些活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，尤其是关注1-D边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的催化剂用于商业应用具有重要意义。通过阐明硼配位、氢键能力以及硼聚合的作用，研究人员可以指导催化剂结构的设计，优化硼物种的空间排列和连接性，可能最终导致性能更优的催化剂的创造。这些知识可以引导开发新型催化剂架构，旨在提高工业应用中的效率和选择性。
