<p>Nevertheless, increasing boron loading for supported catalysts is an straightforward route to create more active sites for the ODH reactions [11] ,[12] ,[19] ,[20] .

1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, well-dispersed and accessible active boron species are crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity.

2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form, highly active boron centers can be constructed.

3. The dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts affects their performance in ODHP reactions. The catalysts with low crystallinity exhibit superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature due to the enrichment of defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols.

4. The structure of boron species on the zeolite catalysts plays a critical role in ODHP reactions. The incomplete crystallization of the zeolite catalysts enriches the defect boron sites, enhancing the catalytic activity.

5. The dynamic transformation of isolated boron species into aggregated ones during the ODHP process is closely related to the increased catalytic activity of the catalysts. The aggregated boron species with hydrogen bonds formed with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reactions at low temperature.

1. 催化剂中硼活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。特别是，分散良好的可访问活性硼物种对于增强催化活性至关重要。

2. 理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，尤其是1-D边活性位点，对设计商业应用更高效的催化剂有贡献。通过使硼物种均匀锚定到富含羟基的MFI型沸石矩阵中的寡聚体形式，可以构建高度活性的硼中心。

3. 催化剂中活性位点的维度影响其在ODHP反应中的性能。具有低结晶性的催化剂表现出优越的活性和低温下较高的烯烃产率，这是由于富集了与相邻硅醇键合的缺陷硼位点。

4. 沸石催化剂上硼物种的结构在ODHP反应中起着关键作用。沸石催化剂的不完全结晶丰富了缺陷硼位点，从而增强了催化活性。

5. 在ODHP过程中，孤立的硼物种动态转化为聚合物，这与催化剂活性的增加密切相关。聚合硼物种与相邻SiOH形成的氢键被识别为活性中心，并在低温下高效催化ODHP反应。
