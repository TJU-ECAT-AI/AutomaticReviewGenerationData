The performance of B-based catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions is influenced by the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites. The study highlights that the 1-D edge active sites in embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts play a crucial role in improving olefin and propylene selectivity, surpassing conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalysts. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Understanding the role of these sites in facilitating the gas-phase reactions, which strengthens the activation of propane, leads to an increased reaction order from 1.06 to 2.30, enhancing the catalytic performance of the EBZ catalyst.
