• "The EBZ catalyst shows improved olefin and propylene selectivity which outperforms the conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolite."
• "The H-bonded BOH groups are presently identified as the active center for the activation of propane and triggering the gas-phase reactions."
• "The strengthened contribution of gas-phase reaction facilitates the activation of propane, consequently resulting in higher reaction order of propane."
• "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."
• "It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."

This literature discusses the enhanced performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, specifically highlighting improved olefin and propylene selectivity over conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites. The active centers are identified as H-bonded BOH groups, which facilitate the activation of propane and trigger gas-phase reactions. The literature suggests that the unique properties of embryonic zeolites, including their extra-large microporosity, enable stronger gas-phase reactions, thereby facilitating the activation of propane and improving the reaction order. This results in enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

这篇文献讨论了在氧化脱氢反应中，胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石催化剂的增强性能，特别指出其在丙烷选择性上的优势，超过了传统的MFI型硼硅酸盐沸石。文献中提到的活性中心是氢键结合的BOH基团，它们能够促进丙烷的激活并触发气相反应。文献表明，与具有微孔结构和饱和配位框架原子的结晶沸石相比，胚胎沸石的独特性质，包括其超大的微孔结构，能够促进更强的气相反应，从而促进丙烷的激活，并提高反应的级数。这导致了在丙烷转化和丙烯选择性方面的催化性能显著提升。
