The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. In particular, 1-D edge active sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites allows for the optimization of catalysts, leading to improvements in olefin and propylene selectivity. For instance, embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalysts display superior performance, achieving a 20% enhancement in propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalysts. The enhanced selectivity is attributed to the formation of boron sites in open coordination from the defect-rich structure of EBZ, which ensures ample exposure of the active center. Kinetic measurements indicate that the gas-phase reactions initiated by these active boron sites are primarily responsible for the high catalytic performance in ODHP reactions. This research underscores the crucial role of gas-phase reactions during propane oxidative dehydrogenation and offers novel insights for boosting propylene selectivity in zeolite-based catalysts.

活性位点的空间分布和维度在B基催化剂中对丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的性能产生了显著影响。特别是，1-D边活性位点对于商业应用中的高效催化剂设计至关重要。对这些位点的独特特性和反应机制的理解使得优化催化剂成为可能，从而提高了烯烃和丙烯的选择性。例如，胚胎硼硅酸盐沸石（EBZ）催化剂表现出优越的性能，在21.5%丙烷转化率下，540°C时实现了20%的丙烯选择性提高，与常规MFI型硼硅酸盐沸石催化剂相比，丙烯生产力几乎提高了1个数量级。增强的选择性归因于从EBZ的缺陷丰富的结构形成的硼位点在开放协调中形成，这确保了活性中心的充分暴露。动力学测量表明，由这些活性硼位点引发的气相反应是ODHP反应中高催化性能的主要原因。这项研究强调了气相反应在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的关键作用，并为提升基于沸石的催化剂中丙烯选择性提供了新的见解。
