[1] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."
[2] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."
[3] "In addition, the large microporous spaces provide free environments for gas-phase reactions, allowing X-ray amorphous zeolitic material as a model system for the fundamental investigation of ODHP reaction."
[4] "The H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."
[5] "It enables the enhanced catalytic performance of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalyst in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. In particular, embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts with their extra-large microporosity and large microporous spaces facilitate the activation of propane and boost the propylene selectivity. The presence of H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species on the surface and in the gas phase enables efficient activation of propane and contributes to the high performance in ODHP reactions. The enhanced catalytic performance of these catalysts, in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity, is attributed to the strengthened contribution of gas-phase reactions, which facilitates the activation of propane.
