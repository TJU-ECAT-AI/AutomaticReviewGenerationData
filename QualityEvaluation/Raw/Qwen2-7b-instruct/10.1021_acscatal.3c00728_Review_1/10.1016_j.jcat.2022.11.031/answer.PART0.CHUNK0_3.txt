The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The literature highlights that the embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalyst demonstrates improved olefin and propylene selectivity over conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites. The active center for propane activation and triggering gas-phase reactions is identified as the H-bonded BOH groups in the defect-rich structure of EBZ. Strengthening the contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitates the activation of propane, increasing the reaction order from 1.06 to 2.30. The literature suggests that constructing highly exposed active boron centers and enhancing gas-phase reactions may lead to the development of highly active and selective ODHP catalysts.
