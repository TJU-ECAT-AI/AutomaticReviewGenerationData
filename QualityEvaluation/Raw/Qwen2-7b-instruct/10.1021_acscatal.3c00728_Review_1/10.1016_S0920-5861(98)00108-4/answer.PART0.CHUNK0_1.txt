[1] "Catalysts studied in the present work (V2O5/TiO2, rare-earth oxide-based systems, B2O3/Al2O3) were chosen taking into account the above classification."
[2] "A question about the type of acidity arises. No conventional method of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 or pyridine can be used for B2O3-containing catalyst to distinguish between Lewis and Brnsted acidity because of strong absorption of boria in the range from 1100 to 1700 cm1 masking any adsorbate peaks."
[3] "Oxidation of alkanes via radical chain reactions was assumed for the air oxidation of butane to acetic acid and cyclohexane to adipic acid [21] in the presence of Co compounds."
[4] "The effect of oxygen partial pressure on product formation over a B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 6 ."

1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, such as 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

2. The type of acidity, specifically Lewis acidity, is pivotal for the activation of propane on B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. This is due to the formation of propyl radicals via homolytic CH-bond splitting, which subsequently release in the gas phase. This process contrasts with redox systems and REO-based catalysts, which involve different activation mechanisms.

3. The activation of propane on B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts occurs on Lewis acid sites, leading to the formation of propyl radicals. These radicals, once released into the gas phase, undergo secondary reactions to produce olefins and oxygenates with high selectivities.

4. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on product formation over a B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3 catalyst is significant. An increase in oxygen partial pressure results in a notable increase in propene and CO space-time yields. However, no predominant formation of CO is observed with increasing oxygen concentration. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on the space-time yields of ethylene and CO2 is less pronounced.

1. 在B基催化剂中，如1-D边缘活性位点的空间分布和维度对于其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能至关重要。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商用催化剂。

2. 对于B2O3/Al2O3催化剂，丙烷的激活发生在Lewis酸性位点上，导致丙基自由基的形成。这些自由基在气相中释放后，通过二级反应产生烯烃和氧化合物，具有较高的选择性。这与红氧化系统和REO基催化剂涉及的不同激活机制相对照。

3. B2O3/Al2O3催化剂上的丙烷激活发生在Lewis酸性位点上，导致丙基自由基的形成。这些自由基一旦释放到气相中，就会通过二级反应生成烯烃和氧化合物，具有高选择性。

4. 氧分压对B2O3（30 wt%）/Al2O3催化剂上产物形成的影响显著。氧分压的增加导致丙烯和CO时空产率显著增加。然而，随着氧浓度的增加，并没有观察到主要的CO形成。氧分压对乙烯和CO2的时空产率的影响较小。
