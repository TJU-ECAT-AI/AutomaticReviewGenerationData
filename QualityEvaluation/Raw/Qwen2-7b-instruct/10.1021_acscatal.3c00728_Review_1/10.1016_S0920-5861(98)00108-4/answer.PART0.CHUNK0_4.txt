3.3. B2O3-containing catalysts
As reported earlier [20] , the dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is suppressed on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions. Also no reaction of propane with lattice oxygen was detected by pulsing C3H8 over boriaalumina catalyst in the TAP reactor in the temperature range from 783 to 853 K. Therefore, propane activation via redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen can be excluded on this type of catalyst. A propyl radical is assumed to be the reactive intermediate; olefines and oxygenates are formed with high selectivities by secondary reactions of propyl radicals after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation [20] .

The type of acidity plays a decisive role in the propane activation on B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. The mechanism of the oxidative conversion of propane which takes place on this type of catalyst differs from those on V- or REO-based catalysts. In this case, acidity seems to play a crucial role in the activation of propane. A question about the type of acidity arises. No conventional method of IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 or pyridine can be used for B2O3-containing catalyst to distinguish between Lewis and Brnsted acidity because of strong absorption of boria in the range from 1100 to 1700 cm1 masking any adsorbate peaks. Results of the HD exchange reaction in C3D8 with surface hydrogen showed that addition of boria to alumina resulted in the elimination of mobile hydrogen. Thus, a decrease in Brnsted acidity was assumed for B2O3/Al2O3 compared to Al2O3 [20]. As estimated from NH3-TPD measurements, the total number of acid sites, however, increased with boria doping and amounted to 1.8 and 8.3 μmol NH3/m2 for Al2O3 and B2O3 (30 wt%)/Al2O3, respectively. The values do not differ much from those reported in [23]. Thus, the boria/alumina catalyst possesses most likely a Lewis acidity which determines the activation of propane.

在B2O3/Al2O3催化剂上，丙烷激活的关键在于酸性。与V或REO基催化剂上的反应机制不同，这种类型的催化剂上的激活过程主要由酸性决定。对于B2O3/Al2O3催化剂来说，其Lewis酸性可能起着决定性作用。关于酸性的类型存在疑问。传统的红外光谱方法无法通过NH3或吡啶吸附来区分Lewis酸性和Brnsted酸性，因为硼酸在1100到1700 cm1范围内的强烈吸收会掩盖任何吸附剂峰。C3D8与表面氢的HD交换反应显示，将硼酸添加到氧化铝中导致移动氢的消除。因此，假设与Al2O3相比，B2O3/Al2O3的Brnsted酸性降低。根据NH3-TPD测量的结果，随着硼酸的掺杂，总酸位点的数量增加，并且分别达到1.8和8.3 μmol NH3/m2。这些值与[23]中报告的数据相差不大。因此，硼酸/氧化铝催化剂很可能是具有Lewis酸性的，这决定了丙烷的激活过程。
