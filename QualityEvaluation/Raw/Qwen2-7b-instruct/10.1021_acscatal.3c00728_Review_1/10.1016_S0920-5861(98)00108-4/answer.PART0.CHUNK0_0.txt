3.3. B2O3-containing catalysts
As reported earlier [20] , the dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is suppressed on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions. Also no reaction of propane with lattice oxygen was detected by pulsing C3H8 over boriaalumina catalyst in the TAP reactor in the temperature range from 783 to 853 K. Therefore, propane activation via redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen can be excluded on this type of catalyst. A propyl radical is assumed to be the reactive intermediate; olefines and oxygenates are formed with high selectivities by secondary reactions of propyl radicals after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation [20] .

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable the formation of propyl radicals, which desorb into the gas phase. This unique property allows for the selective formation of olefins and oxygenates through secondary reactions. Understanding these reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by optimizing the active site structure and reactivity.
