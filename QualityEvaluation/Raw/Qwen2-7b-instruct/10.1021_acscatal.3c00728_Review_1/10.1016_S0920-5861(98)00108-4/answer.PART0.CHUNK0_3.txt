[1] "In this case, the catalysts studied (V2O5/TiO2, rare-earth oxide-based systems, B2O3/Al2O3) were chosen taking into account the above classification."
[2] "As follows from the transient studies, ethylene can be formed via a surface induced CC splitting in the propane molecule due to adsorbed oxygen."
[3] "On B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, propane activation via redox mechanism or by adsorbed oxygen can be excluded as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions."
[4] "A propyl radical is assumed to be the reactive intermediate; olefines and oxygenates are formed with high selectivities by secondary reactions of propyl radicals after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation."
[5] "There is, however, another possibility of propane activation involving homolytic CH-bond splitting with the formation of propyl and hydrogen radicals which both release in the gas phase due to suppressed surface oxidation."

1. The catalysts selected for studying the oxidative conversion of propane were categorized based on their activation mechanisms. Redox systems, systems involving adsorbed oxygen, and those with Lewis acid sites were chosen for their distinct activation mechanisms.

2. Adsorbed oxygen can induce the splitting of propane's carbon-carbon (CC) bonds during the reaction, leading to the formation of ethylene, methane, and other hydrocarbons.

3. The dissociative adsorption of oxygen and propane is inhibited on B-based catalysts, eliminating the possibility of redox mechanism or adsorbed oxygen activation.

4. The activation of propane on B-based catalysts is believed to occur through the formation of propyl radicals. These radicals are produced by the Lewis acidity of the catalyst and then released into the gas phase, leading to the formation of olefins and oxygenates.

5. Another pathway for propane activation on B-based catalysts involves homolytic splitting of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds, resulting in the release of propyl and hydrogen radicals into the gas phase.

1. 用于研究丙烷氧化转换的催化剂被分类为三种类型，包括红氧化系统、涉及吸附氧的系统以及具有Lewis酸位点的系统，这些分类基于它们的激活机制。

2. 吸附氧可以诱导丙烷分子中的碳-碳（CC）键断裂，导致乙烯、甲烷和其他烃类化合物的形成。

3. 在硼基催化剂上，氧和丙烷的离散吸附被抑制，排除了氧化还原机制或吸附氧激活的可能性。

4. 丙烷在硼基催化剂上的激活被认为通过形成丙基自由基发生。这些自由基由催化剂的Lewis酸性产生，并随后释放到气相中，导致烯烃和氧有机物的形成。

5. 另一种丙烷激活途径涉及CH键的同裂解，导致丙基和氢自由基在表面氧化减弱的情况下释放到气相中。
