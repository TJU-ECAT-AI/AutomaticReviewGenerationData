[1] "In the case of the redox-mechanism on V2O5-based catalysts the degree of catalyst reduction which is affected by the propane-to-oxygen ratio determines the catalyst activity and selectivity."
[2] "On rare-earth oxide-based catalysts, activation of propane by adsorbed oxygen takes place."
[3] "In the third case it was assumed that propane activation takes place on solids with strongly bound lattice oxygen, which, in addition, exhibit low activity towards dissociative adsorption of oxygen."
[4] "The results obtained indicate that high catalyst activity towards oxygen adsorption caused the ignition of the reaction mixture in the oxidative conversion of propane on REO-based catalysts."
[5] "Boriaalumina catalysts show high propene and oxygenates selectivities even at degrees of propane conversions higher than 20%."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, have unique properties that contribute to the formation of propyl radicals. This process, facilitated by Lewis acidity, enables the selective formation of olefins and oxygenates. Understanding these sites helps in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, Boriaalumina catalysts demonstrate high propene and oxygenates selectivities, even at high propane conversion levels, showcasing the potential for improved commercial performance.
