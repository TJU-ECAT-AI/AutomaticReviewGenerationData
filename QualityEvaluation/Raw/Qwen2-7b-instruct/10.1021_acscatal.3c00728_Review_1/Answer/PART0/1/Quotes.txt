[1] "Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range 020 wt.-%."
          [2] "The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased."
          [3] "All catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream."
          [4] "There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity."
          [5] "This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation."
          [6] "Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength."
          [7] "A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam."
