It was observed that as the boron oxide loading increased, the surface areas of the catalysts decreased, correlating with a decline in catalytic activity over time. A direct relationship was established between the formation of coke on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. The catalyst with the highest boron oxide loading showed the least coke formation and maintained the highest catalytic activity. Additionally, the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength was linked to the selectivity towards caprolactam production, and there was a correlation between the concentration of these sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.", "Chinese": "研究分析了用于环己酮肟转化为己内酰胺过程的B2O3/Al2O3催化剂中氧化硼负载对其酸性的影响。发现随着氧化硼负载的增加，催化剂的比表面积下降，与活性随时间递减的趋势一致。建立了表面焦炭形成量与活性损失直接关系。最高氧化硼负载的催化剂表现出最少的焦炭形成和最高的催化活性。同时，表面中等强度酸性位点的存在与对己内酰胺的选择性相关联，并观察到这些位点的浓度与选择性之间存在相关性。", "Doi": "10.1016/0926-860X(92)80296-O"},
