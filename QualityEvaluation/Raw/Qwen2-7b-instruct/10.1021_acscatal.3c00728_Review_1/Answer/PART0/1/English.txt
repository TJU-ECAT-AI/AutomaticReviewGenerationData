The role of the support material in enhancing the reactivity of vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been widely studied. In propane ODH, increasing the loading of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) leads to higher catalytic activity, with the highest rate per vanadium atom occurring on domains of intermediate size. This balances the activity of surface vanadium oxide species with their accessibility to reactants. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state ODH is significantly less than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium ions. Only a portion of the reduced centers participate in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times. The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection, has significantly expanded the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, contributing to the discovery of new catalysts. Additionally, hydrogen (H2) formation under typical conditions for alkanes ODH has been observed, although most reported catalysts for propane ODH yield propylene with yields below 30%.

The performance of supported boria catalysts can be optimized through strategic adjustments of various parameters including the type of support material, boron oxide load, and its dispersion. Notably, the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst, when supported on zirconia, exhibits exceptional catalytic efficiency in synthesizing ε-caprolactam, achieving an average yield of 95% over a 6-hour operation period. Increasing the boron oxide load to 20% boosts the lactam selectivity, albeit with a fluctuating lactam yield that peaks at a boron oxide load of 10%. All B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts demonstrate superior performance compared to zirconia alone in the Beckmann reaction. The optimal boron oxide load is determined to be 10%, corresponding to two layers of boron oxide on the zirconia support.

The study explored the impact of boron oxide loading on the acidity of B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts utilized for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam. It was observed that as the boron oxide loading increased, the surface areas of the catalysts decreased, correlating with a decline in catalytic activity over time. A direct relationship was established between the formation of coke on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. The catalyst with the highest boron oxide loading showed the least coke formation and maintained the highest catalytic activity. Additionally, the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength was linked to the selectivity towards caprolactam production, and there was a correlation between the concentration of these sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.

The role of the support material in enhancing the reactivity of vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been widely studied. In propane ODH, increasing the loading of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) leads to higher catalytic activity, with the highest rate per vanadium atom occurring on domains of intermediate size. This balances the activity of surface vanadium oxide species with their accessibility to reactants. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state ODH is significantly less than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium ions. Only a portion of the reduced centers participate in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times. The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection, has significantly expanded the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, contributing to the discovery of new catalysts. Additionally, hydrogen (H2) formation under typical conditions for alkanes ODH has been observed, although most reported catalysts for propane ODH yield propylene with yields below 30%.
