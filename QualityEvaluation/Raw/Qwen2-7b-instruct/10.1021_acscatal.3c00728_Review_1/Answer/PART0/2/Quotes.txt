3.1. Effect of reaction temperature

In the previous study, gas phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime over zirconia based catalysts was carried out at 300C and 350C [14] . A 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst showed the highest lactam yield (>94%) at either temperature for 6 h of reaction.

3.2. Comparison with other supports

A total of six oxides, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), are used, respectively, to support 10% B2O3 for the rearrangement at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

Improvement of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst is made with optimizing the boria load. The catalysts with different boria load are compared for the Beckmann reaction at 300C for a period of TOS 6 h.

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements

Fig. 7 shows the infrared spectra of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. The sample with 5% B2O3 shows two broad absorption bands at 13801430 and 10001150 cm1. The band at 13801430 cm1 shifts upto 1460 cm1 while the band at 1001150 cm1 disappears with increasing the boria load. Simultaneously, new bands at 1190 and 885 cm1 grow in proportion with the boria load.

NH3-TPD is performed to compare the surface acidity of the catalysts. The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8. Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively.

3.4. IR and NH3-TPD measurements

Fig. 7 shows the infrared spectra of B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. The sample with 5% B2O3 shows two broad absorption bands at 13801430 and 10001150 cm1. The band at 13801430 cm1 shifts upto 1460 cm1 while the band at 1001150 cm1 disappears with increasing the boria load. Simultaneously, new bands at 1190 and 885 cm1 grow in proportion with the boria load.

NH3-TPD is performed to compare the surface acidity of the catalysts. The resultant TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 8. Desorption of adsorbed NH3 from the catalyst covers a broad range of temperature (50400C) and features three peaks centered at about 100C, 200C, and 300C, respectively.
