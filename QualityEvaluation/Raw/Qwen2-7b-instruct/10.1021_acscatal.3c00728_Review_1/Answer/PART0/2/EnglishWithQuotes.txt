The systematic analysis of the growth mechanism for the nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film reveals a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface. The sp3 edges of nc-G are crucial for initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without the need for a metal catalyst.\n      \n          2. The key role of the sp3 edges of nc-G in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer explains why uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions. This highlights the importance of the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in catalyst performance.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.201405762"},
