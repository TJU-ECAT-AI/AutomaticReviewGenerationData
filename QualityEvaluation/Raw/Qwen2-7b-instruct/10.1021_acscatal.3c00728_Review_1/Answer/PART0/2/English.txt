Reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide in propane and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are consistent with both the dissociation of CH bonds (specifically, the methylenic carbon atom in propane) and a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in the activation of CH bonds. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium reduction is significantly lower than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium ions. Only a portion of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times. Most reported catalysts for propane ODH yield ethylene with yields lower than 20%. The best performance in propane ODH has been achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides.

1. The systematic analysis of the growth mechanism for the nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film reveals a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface. The sp3 edges of nc-G are crucial for initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without the need for a metal catalyst.
      
          2. The key role of the sp3 edges of nc-G in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer explains why uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions. This highlights the importance of the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in catalyst performance.

The study investigated the effect of reaction temperature on the synthesis of ε-caprolactam using B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts supported on zirconia. The catalysts were operated at 300°C and 350°C, demonstrating the highest lactam yield of over 94% for a 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst at both temperatures. For comparison, six other oxide supports (ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and HZSM-5) were utilized to support 10% B2O3 under similar conditions. The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was optimized by adjusting the boron oxide load, which was then compared in the Beckmann reaction at 300°C for a duration of 6 hours. The infrared spectra of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts reveal changes in the absorption bands with varying boron oxide load. Specifically, the band at 1380-1430 cm−1 shifts to 1460 cm−1 and the band at 1000-1150 cm−1 diminishes as the boron oxide load increases, indicating alterations in the catalyst structure. The ammonia thermogravimetric desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis further elucidates the surface acidity of the catalysts, with distinct peaks centered around 100°C, 200°C, and 300°C, respectively, highlighting the diverse acidic properties across different temperatures.

Reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide in propane and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are consistent with both the dissociation of CH bonds (specifically, the methylenic carbon atom in propane) and a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in the activation of CH bonds. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium reduction is significantly lower than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium ions. Only a portion of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times. Most reported catalysts for propane ODH yield ethylene with yields lower than 20%. The best performance in propane ODH has been achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides.

1. The systematic analysis of the growth mechanism for the nc-G-tailored h-BN thin film reveals a novel method for preparing high-quality two-dimensional materials on a large surface. The sp3 edges of nc-G are crucial for initiating and promoting the lateral growth of h-BN on the nc-G layer without the need for a metal catalyst.
      
          2. The key role of the sp3 edges of nc-G in the formation of h-BN with an atomically flat surface on the rough nc-G layer explains why uniformly flat h-BN does not form on a monolayer graphene-transferred c-Al2O3 substrate under equivalent growth conditions. This highlights the importance of the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in catalyst performance.

The study investigated the effect of reaction temperature on the synthesis of ε-caprolactam using B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts supported on zirconia. The catalysts were operated at 300°C and 350°C, demonstrating the highest lactam yield of over 94% for a 10% B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst at both temperatures. For comparison, six other oxide supports (ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, and HZSM-5) were utilized to support 10% B2O3 under similar conditions. The performance of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalyst was optimized by adjusting the boron oxide load, which was then compared in the Beckmann reaction at 300°C for a duration of 6 hours. The infrared spectra of the B2O3/ZrO2 catalysts reveal changes in the absorption bands with varying boron oxide load. Specifically, the band at 1380-1430 cm−1 shifts to 1460 cm−1 and the band at 1000-1150 cm−1 diminishes as the boron oxide load increases, indicating alterations in the catalyst structure. The ammonia thermogravimetric desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis further elucidates the surface acidity of the catalysts, with distinct peaks centered around 100°C, 200°C, and 300°C, respectively, highlighting the diverse acidic properties across different temperatures.
