          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing their performance during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. This is because different spatial arrangements and dimensions of the active sites affect how efficiently the reactants interact and transform. Specifically, the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites are pivotal in improving catalyst efficiency. By gaining insight into these specific site characteristics, researchers can develop more effective catalysts suitable for industrial use.
