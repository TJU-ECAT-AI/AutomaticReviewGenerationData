[1] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
          [2] "In the case of propane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. "
          [3] "The best performance in propane ODH has been obtained with non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides."
