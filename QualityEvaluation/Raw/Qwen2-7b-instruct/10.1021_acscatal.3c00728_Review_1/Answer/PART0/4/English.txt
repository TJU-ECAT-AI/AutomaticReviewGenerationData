Reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide in propane and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are consistent with both the dissociation of CH bonds (specifically, the methylenic carbon atom in propane) and a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in the activation of CH bonds. Most reported catalysts for propane ODH yield ethylene with yields lower than 20%. The best performance in propane ODH has been achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially 1-D edge active sites, aids in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
