          [2] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
          [3] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
          [4] "The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181] ,[187] ,[189] ,[263] ,[264] ,[265] ,[266] ,[267] ,[268] ,[269] ."

          The role of the support material in enhancing the reactivity of vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been widely studied. In propane ODH, increasing the loading of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) leads to higher catalytic activity, with the highest rate per vanadium atom occurring on domains of intermediate size. This balances the activity of surface vanadium oxide species with their accessibility to reactants. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state ODH is significantly less than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium ions. Only a portion of the reduced centers participate in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times. The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection, has significantly expanded the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, contributing to the discovery of new catalysts. Additionally, hydrogen (H2) formation under typical conditions for alkanes ODH has been observed, although most reported catalysts for propane ODH yield propylene with yields below 30%.

          许多研究者已经探讨了支持材料如何增强烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）中钒氧化物催化剂的活性。在丙烷ODH中，增加五氧化二钒（V2O5）的负载量可以提高催化活性，最大反应速率发生在中等大小的VOx域上，这平衡了表面VOx物种的活性与它们对反应物的可接近性。在稳态ODH过程中，钒的减少程度远低于V5+到V4+或V3+的等摩尔减少。只有部分减少中心参与催化循环，其余部分在比循环时间长得多的时间尺度上被重新氧化。组合/并行系统，包括遗传算法和进化催化剂选择方法，极大地增加了可以制备和研究的催化系统的数量，为新催化剂的发现做出了重要贡献。此外，在典型条件下进行烷烃ODH时，会观察到氢（H2）的形成，但大多数报道的丙烷ODH催化剂的丙烯产率低于30%。

          [1] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
          [2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
          [3] "In the case of propane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. "
          [4] "The best performance in propane ODH has been obtained with non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides."
