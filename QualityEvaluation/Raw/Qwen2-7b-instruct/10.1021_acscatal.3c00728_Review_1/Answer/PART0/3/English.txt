The role of the support material in enhancing the reactivity of vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been widely studied. In propane ODH, increasing the loading of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) leads to higher catalytic activity, with the highest rate per vanadium atom occurring on domains of intermediate size. This balances the activity of surface vanadium oxide species with their accessibility to reactants. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state ODH is significantly less than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium ions. Only a portion of the reduced centers participate in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times. The use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection, has significantly expanded the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, contributing to the discovery of new catalysts. The best performance in propane ODH has been achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides.

The study investigates the selective use of BO oligomers or ring species in AlB2 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. It emphasizes that understanding the distinct characteristics and reaction pathways of active sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, is crucial for developing more efficient catalysts suitable for industrial use.

The document lacks specific information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reactions. It also fails to explore the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially those of 1-D edge active sites, which are crucial for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
