In propane ODH, increasing the loading of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) leads to higher catalytic activity, with the highest rate per vanadium atom occurring on domains of intermediate size. This balances the activity of surface vanadium oxide species with their accessibility to reactants. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state ODH is significantly less than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium ions. Only a portion of the reduced centers participate in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times.
