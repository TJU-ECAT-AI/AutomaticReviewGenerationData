<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. This is because the arrangement and structure of these active sites affect the reaction kinetics and selectivity. In particular, 1-D edge active sites exhibit unique properties and reaction mechanisms that offer advantages over 2-D and 3-D sites. These features contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts suitable for industrial use.
