Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts is crucial for enhancing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature demonstrates that boron-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit remarkable selectivity in ODHP reactions, converting propane to propene. This selectivity can be attributed to the improved chemical stability and enhanced resistance to oxidation after boron oxide modification. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, specifically the 1-D edge sites, play a significant role in the efficiency of these catalysts. By modifying the surface of carbon materials with boron, the catalytic sites are optimized to selectively abstract hydrogen atoms from CH bonds of alkanes, forming alkenes through a redox process. This selective mechanism is crucial for the conversion of propane to propene without unwanted total oxidation, making boron-modified CNTs an attractive alternative to conventional metal oxides in the field of alkane conversion. Moreover, the enhanced selectivity of boron-modified CNTs compared to pristine CNTs and various metal-based catalysts suggests that the 1-D edge active sites are responsible for the superior performance in ODHP reactions. This understanding not only contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts but also opens up new avenues for commercial applications, offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional metal catalysts.

理解硼基催化剂中一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制对于提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能至关重要。文献表明，硼改性的碳纳米管（CNTs）在ODHP反应中表现出非凡的选择性，将丙烷转化为丙烯。这种选择性可以归因于硼氧化物修饰后化学稳定性的改善和对氧化的增强抵抗力。活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘位点，在这些催化剂的效率中起着关键作用。通过在碳材料表面改性硼，催化位点优化以从烷烃的CH键上选择性地提取氢原子，形成烯烃通过还原氧化过程。这种选择性机制对于无误总氧化转化丙烷到丙烯至关重要，使硼改性的CNTs成为传统金属氧化物在烷烃转换领域有吸引力的替代品。此外，硼改性CNTs与原位CNTs以及各种金属基催化剂相比，增强的选择性表明，1-D边缘活性位点负责ODHP反应中的优越性能。这一理解不仅有助于设计更高效的催化剂，而且为商业应用开辟了新途径，提供了传统金属催化剂的可持续和环保替代方案。
