[1] "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity."
[2] "Such a pronounced enhancement can be related to the improved chemical stability after modification."
[3] "The modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts."
[4] "This result indicates that surface modification with B2O3 solely affects non-selective active sites."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with boron oxide enhances their selectivity in ODHP reactions, suggesting that the improved chemical stability after modification leads to more selective active sites. This is demonstrated through comparisons with a variety of supported vanadia catalysts, where B-based catalysts show superior selectivity. The surface modification with boron oxide affects non-selective active sites, thereby increasing the selectivity towards propene formation in the ODHP reaction.

B基催化剂，尤其是1-D边缘活性位点的空间分布和维度，在氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中的性能有显著影响。理解这些位点的独特特性和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商用催化剂。通过将碳纳米管（CNT）改性为硼氧化物，可以提高其在ODHP反应中的选择性。这表明在改性后，化学稳定性得到改善，导致了更具有选择性的活性位点。与各种负载的钒基催化剂相比，B基催化剂表现出更高的选择性。表面改性使用硼氧化物会影响非选择性活性位点，从而增加丙烯生成的选择性。
