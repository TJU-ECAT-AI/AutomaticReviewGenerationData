The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, specifically carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide, play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These modifications lead to remarkable selectivity in converting propane to propene. The enhanced chemical stability after modification is directly linked to the improved selectivity. Moreover, these modified CNTs exhibit superior selectivity compared to various supported vanadia catalysts, making them a promising alternative to traditional metal oxide catalysts for alkane conversion. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contribute significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
