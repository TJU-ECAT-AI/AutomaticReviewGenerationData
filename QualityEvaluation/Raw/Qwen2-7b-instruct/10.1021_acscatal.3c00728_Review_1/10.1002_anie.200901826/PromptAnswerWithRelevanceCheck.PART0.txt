The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites play a crucial role in enhancing the selectivity of propene formation. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The modification with boron oxide improves the chemical stability of the catalyst, leading to a superior selectivity towards propene formation. The uniform nature of the active sites across various catalysts, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and vanadia catalysts, suggests that the effect of boron and phosphorus oxide is to block or cover combustion sites on the surface, thereby affecting non-selective active sites and improving propene selectivity. The presence of near-surface oxygen is observed to be lower in modified catalysts, indicating a loss of oxygen species, which might contribute to the improved selectivity.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts is crucial for enhancing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature demonstrates that boron-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit remarkable selectivity in ODHP reactions, converting propane to propene. This selectivity can be attributed to the improved chemical stability and enhanced resistance to oxidation after boron oxide modification. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, specifically the 1-D edge sites, play a significant role in the efficiency of these catalysts. By modifying the surface of carbon materials with boron, the catalytic sites are optimized to selectively abstract hydrogen atoms from CH bonds of alkanes, forming alkenes through a redox process. This selective mechanism is crucial for the conversion of propane to propene without unwanted total oxidation, making boron-modified CNTs an attractive alternative to conventional metal oxides in the field of alkane conversion. Moreover, the enhanced selectivity of boron-modified CNTs compared to pristine CNTs and various metal-based catalysts suggests that the 1-D edge active sites are responsible for the superior performance in ODHP reactions. This understanding not only contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts but also opens up new avenues for commercial applications, offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional metal catalysts.

[Heteroatoms Increase the Selectivity in Oxidative Dehydrogenation Reactions on Nanocarbons]
[Graphical Abstract]
[Boron makes it selective: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity.]
[Nanocarbon can be an attractive alternative to conventional metal oxides, as it enables a feasible investigation of the reaction mechanism and provides a sustainable technology for alkane conversion.]
[The surface of carbon materials is usually terminated by a variety of oxygen functional groups.]
[Of these surface species, the ketonic and quinoidic groups are rich in electrons and thus have great potential to coordinate a redox process.]
[Lewis basic sites can abstract hydrogen atoms from CH bonds of alkanes to produce the corresponding alkenes.]
[The reaction of gas-phase oxygen with the abstracted hydrogen will regenerate the active sites, with formation of water as the product.]
[One of the hottest topics in carbon chemistry is the use of nanostructured carbons, and especially carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as metal-free catalysts.]
[Recent reports have shown an outstanding performance of nanoscaled carbon materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of hydrocarbons.]
[In contrast to supported transition metal oxides, nanocarbon as a simple platform is highly adaptable to kinetic and mechanistic investigations of complex redox reactions.]
[Our recent work has indicated a similar mechanism to that on vanadium oxide catalysts.]
[In carbon-catalyzed ODH reactions, ethylbenzene is predominantly used as the substrate, as the stable conjugated system of the product styrene allows for high yields.]
[Both the inferior selectivity and the yield of alkenes have so far retarded the industrial application of the ODH technology despite outstanding advantages of the oxidative pathway as compared to non-oxidative processes for alkene production.]
[Nucleophilic oxygen species, such as O2, inside the active domains have been identified as being the prerequisite for a high alkene selectivity.]
[Unfortunately, the most likely intermediates during the activation of O2 molecules, O22, O2, and O, are electrophilic and thus ultimately cause total oxidation, especially of the produced alkene, which has an electron-rich π-bond.]
[The implementation of an electron-attracting dopant, such as boron or boron oxide, will reduce the generation of highly reactive oxygen species and is thus expected to increase the selectivity to propene.]
[Samples with boron oxide and phosphorus oxide have a superior selectivity towards propene formation than pristine CNTs and oCNTs.]
[Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles reveal an increasing resistance to oxidation in the order CNTs<oCNTs2B-oCNTs5B-oCNTs<5P-oCNTs.]
[The onset temperature and peak position shift to higher temperature with an increasing amount of boron oxide.]
[The modification with borate and phosphate is indeed reported to block the combustion sites serving as a point of attack for gaseous oxygen, and thus to suppress the combustion of the carbon framework at elevated temperatures.]
[From a kinetic point of view, this protective effect of boron oxide modification against O2 activation is reflected by an approximately 40 kJ/mol higher activation energy of O2 conversion.]
[However, the activation of propane is not affected; the activation energy remains at (1305) kJ/mol.]
[The modified CNTs are much more selective than a variety of supported vanadia catalysts.]
[For propene selectivity at 673K, the following trend could be observed: VOx-Al2O3>2B/5B-oCNTsVOx-TiO2>5P-oCNTs>VOx-CeO2>VOx-SiO2>VOx-ZrO2>(o)CNTs.]
[Only an sp2-hybridized carbon atom allows stable and selective ODH catalysis.]
[The compromise is motivated by the poor performance in ODH provided by a reference sample of activated carbon loaded with 5wt% B2O3.]
[Microscopic, spectroscopic, and thermoanalytic techniques were employed to investigate the structural and surface properties of catalysts before and after reaction.]
[Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate.]
[The composite is stable under reaction conditions, and all of the B2O3 (1.7 atom% B for 5B-oCNT) could be detected by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) after use in ODH.]
[The CNT framework was not affected by modification by heteroatoms or the oxidative reaction atmosphere, as shown by subsequent characterizations by Raman spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), and N2 physisorption.]
[As an indication of the disorder of carbon atoms, the ratio of the D-band to the G-band decreases slightly, and it varies between 2.0 and 2.1.]
[The SEM and TEM images show that fresh and used samples have a similar morphology.]
[The position of the major peak in the TPO curves is almost the same; however, a low-temperature peak at around 550K disappears, which is probably due to the removal of some combustible functionalities in the oxidative reactant flow.]
[The initial evolution of catalytic performance of pristine and modified CNT samples is illustrated in the Supporting Information, FigureS7.]
[During the time on-stream, pristine and oxidized CNTs increase in activity.]
[Regarding the N2 physisorption results, a general rise in surface area, and in particular within the <5nm sized pores, may indicate a strong impact of the opening of closed carbon nanotubes at their ends by gas-phase oxygen during the ODH reaction.]
[However, the active sites that are generated are unselective and favor CO2 formation, as shown by a drastic decrease in propene selectivity within the initial period.]
[In contrast, B2O3-modified CNTs deactivate to a small extent initially, which may be due to the decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor.]
[The balance between activity loss and selectivity gain can be tuned by controlling the amount of boron oxide loading.]
[Both overall activity and propene selectivity show a strong dependence on the boron oxide loading.]
[The oxygen exchange capabilities of oCNT samples with and without B2O3 modification were investigated by switching diluted 16O2 with its 18O2 isotope tracer.]
[Electrophilic intermediate oxygen species, such as peroxide or superoxide, on unmodified CNTs are most likely the cause of the high activity but low selectivity with propene.]
[Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.]
[Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent.]
[The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation.]
[An insight into the origin of high activities and selectivities of vanadia and modified CNTs compared to unmodified CNTs is obtained by an experiment with periodic feeds of propane and oxygen.]
[Vanadia catalysts, the most selective metal-based catalysts, can work well at a low partial pressure of oxygen owing to suppression of consecutive propene combustion.]
[Using an oxygen-to-hydrocarbon ratio of 1:1, VOx-Al2O3, 5B-oCNTs, and even non-modified oCNTs provide stable catalytic performance for a time-on-stream of up to 200h.]

1. The presence of heteroatoms, specifically boron, in carbon nanotube catalysts enhances the selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for the conversion of propane to propene. Boron modifies the surface properties of the catalyst, leading to an improvement in the chemical stability and blocking of combustion sites, which reduces the formation of highly reactive oxygen species. This results in a higher selectivity towards propene formation compared to pristine and other modified carbon nanotubes. The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites allow for a more controlled activation of oxygen, optimizing the activation of oxygen molecules and thus improving the alkene selectivity.

2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By modifying the surface of carbon nanotubes with heteroatoms like boron, researchers can create catalysts that are not only more selective but also maintain high activity levels. This approach allows for the development of metal-free catalysts that are sustainable and environmentally friendly, offering alternatives to traditional metal oxide catalysts. The enhanced selectivity and stability of these catalysts make them suitable for industrial applications, potentially revolutionizing the production of alkenes through oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
