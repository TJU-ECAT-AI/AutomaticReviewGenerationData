[1] "The only products that were detected were propene, CO, CO2, and H2O."
[2] "Such a pronounced enhancement can be related to the improved chemical stability after modification."
[3] "As can be seen in Figure1a, samples with boron oxide and phosphorus oxide have a superior selectivity towards propene formation than pristine CNTs and oCNTs."
[4] "Total oxidation of propane is suppressed by boron and phosphorus modification, as seen by an almost 100% propene selectivity by extrapolating to zero propane conversion."
[5] "A lower degree of disorder accompanied by a loss of near-surface oxygen is observed by Raman spectroscopy and also by ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and TPD, respectively."
[6] "The uniform nature of the active sites can be derived from the reaction and characterization measurements."
[7] "It is clear that each carbon catalyst yields a similar amount of propene, especially taking into account the different surface area and amount of surface oxygen."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites play a crucial role in enhancing the selectivity of propene formation. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The modification with boron oxide improves the chemical stability of the catalyst, leading to a superior selectivity towards propene formation. The uniform nature of the active sites across various catalysts, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and vanadia catalysts, suggests that the effect of boron and phosphorus oxide is to block or cover combustion sites on the surface, thereby affecting non-selective active sites and improving propene selectivity. The presence of near-surface oxygen is observed to be lower in modified catalysts, indicating a loss of oxygen species, which might contribute to the improved selectivity.

活性位点的空间分布和维度在硼基催化剂中对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能产生了重大影响。特别是，1-D边缘活性位点在提高丙烯选择性形成方面起着关键作用。理解这些1-D边缘位点的独特性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂以用于商业应用。通过修饰使用硼氧化物可以改善催化剂的化学稳定性，从而提高丙烯选择性形成的能力。均匀的活性位点性质表明，硼和磷氧化物的作用是覆盖表面的燃烧站点，从而影响非选择性活性位点并提高丙烯选择性。观察到近表面氧的减少，可能表明氧气物种的损失，这可能有助于提高选择性。
