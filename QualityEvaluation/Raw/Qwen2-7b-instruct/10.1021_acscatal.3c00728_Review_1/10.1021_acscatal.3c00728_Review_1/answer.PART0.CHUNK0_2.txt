<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The dimensional configuration of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influences their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D active sites located at the edge of h-BN sheets demonstrate exceptional selectivity for olefin products. However, they exhibit an induction period, low density, and require improvement in stability. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.
