Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influences their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Researchers have found that the spatial configuration of active sites, whether they are 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D dispersed, plays a critical role in enhancing the selectivity of olefin products. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites located at the edge of h-BN sheets exhibit superior reactivity and selectivity, offering higher propene selectivity compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts. These sites are characterized by oxygen-functionalized armchair edges, which facilitate the adsorption and reaction of propane molecules.

Several strategies have been proposed to optimize the performance of 1-D B-based catalysts. Preoxygen modification of the edge sites effectively reduces the induction period and enhances the ODHP performance. Additionally, reducing the size of the BN nanosheet increases the density of 1-D active sites, contributing to improved catalytic activity. Aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials further strengthens the BN catalysts. To address stability concerns, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed, incorporating strong metal oxide-support interactions to extend the catalytic stability.

These findings contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, aiming to achieve better selectivity, increased productivity, and enhanced stability in ODHP reactions.

理解B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能具有重要影响。研究发现，活性位点的空间配置，无论是1-D、2-D还是3-D分散，都对提高烯烃产品的选择性至关重要。具体而言，位于h-BN片边缘的1-D边活性位点表现出更高的反应性和选择性，与传统金属氧化物催化剂相比，它们提供了更高的丙烯选择性。这些位点以氧功能化的臂状边缘为特征，能够促进丙烷分子的吸附和反应。

为了优化1-D B基催化剂的性能，提出了几种策略。预氧化修改边缘位点有效地减少了诱导期并提高了ODHP性能。此外，减少BN纳米片的尺寸可以增加1-D活性位点的密度，从而提高催化活性。将活性成分聚集到1-D形状的材料中进一步增强了BN催化剂。为了解决稳定性问题，设计了一种h-BNxIn2O3复合催化剂，通过强金属氧化物支持相互作用来延长催化剂的稳定性。

这些发现为商业应用中更高效催化剂的设计做出了贡献，旨在实现ODHP反应中更好的选择性、更高的生产力和增强的稳定性。
