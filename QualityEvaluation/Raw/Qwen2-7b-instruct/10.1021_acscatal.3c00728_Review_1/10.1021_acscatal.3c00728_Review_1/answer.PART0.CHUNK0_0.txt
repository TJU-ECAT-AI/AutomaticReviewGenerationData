[1] "With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."
[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."
[3] "A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions."
[4] "The special kinetic behavior of BN suggested that the oxygen bonded to boron nitride was relatively stable in the presence of propane."
[5] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site."
[6] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions."
[7] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
[8] "An h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed. The strong metal oxidesupport interaction (SMOSI) effect between In2O3 NPs and h-BN not only strengthened the interlayer force of h-BN like a pin but also weakened the affinity of the BN bond to O·."

Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, is crucial for enhancing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites offer unique properties such as high reactivity and selectivity, which contribute to the production of valuable olefin products. By improving the density and stability of 1-D active sites through various strategies, including preoxygen modification and the creation of composite catalysts, the efficiency of B-based catalysts for ODHP can be significantly increased. This knowledge not only aids in the design of more effective catalysts but also paves the way for their commercial application, offering a more sustainable and economically viable approach to producing olefin products.
