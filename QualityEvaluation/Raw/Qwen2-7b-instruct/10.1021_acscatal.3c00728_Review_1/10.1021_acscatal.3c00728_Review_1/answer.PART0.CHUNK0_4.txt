2. Dimensional Configuration of Active Sites in B-Based ODHP Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1).
To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)
Notably, owing to the complexity and dynamic behaviors of catalyst structures and configurations, B-based catalysts often exhibit more than one type of dispersion pattern of the active sites. Therefore, understanding the catalytic properties of each type of active site is essential for the future design of B-based ODHP catalysts.
The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets.
A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions.
Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction (Figure 2b).
Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved.
The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period.
To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio.
Regarding the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites, an h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially 1-D edge active sites, contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. One-dimensional (1-D) active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, offering higher selectivity for olefins compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts. However, they exhibit an induction period, low density, and stability issues. To overcome these drawbacks, strategies such as preoxygen modification of the edge sites, reducing the size of the BN nanosheet, and designing composite catalysts with strong metal oxide-support interaction can enhance ODHP performance and extend catalyst lifetime. These advancements aim to improve the efficiency and profitability of the ODHP process through optimized catalyst design.

在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能。理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对于设计更高效的商用催化剂至关重要。1-D活性位点在h-BN片的边缘上线性分布，提供更高的烯烃选择性，与常规金属氧化物催化剂相比。然而，它们存在诱导期、密度低和稳定性问题。为了克服这些问题，可以通过预氧修饰边缘位点、减少BN纳米片的尺寸和设计具有强金属氧化物支持作用的复合催化剂等策略来提高ODHP性能并延长催化剂寿命。这些进步旨在通过优化催化剂设计来提高ODHP过程的效率和盈利能力。
