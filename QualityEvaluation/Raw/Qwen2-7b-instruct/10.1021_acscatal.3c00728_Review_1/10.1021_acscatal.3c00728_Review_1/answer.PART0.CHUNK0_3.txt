[1] "With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."
[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)"
[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets."
[4] "The existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition."
[5] "Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts."
[6] "To address these challenges, several performance promotion strategies were proposed."
[7] "The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period."
[8] "An h-BNxIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed. The strong metal oxidesupport interaction (SMOSI) effect between In2O3 NPs and h-BN not only strengthened the interlayer force of h-BN like a pin but also weakened the affinity of the BN bond to O·."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The 1-D active sites are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets, offering enhanced selectivity and reactivity towards olefin products. The existence of an induction period suggests the formation of a real BO active site under specific conditions. Low density of edge active sites in 2-D materials limits the enhancement of catalytic activity, necessitating strategies such as preoxygen modification to improve performance. Composite catalysts, like the h-BNxIn2O3, which utilize the strong metal oxide-support interaction (SMOSI) effect, extend the stability of h-BN and weaken the affinity of the BN bond to O·, enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。理解这些位点的独特特性和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对于设计商业应用中更高效的催化剂至关重要。1-D活性位点在2-D h-BN薄片的边缘呈线性分散，提供增强的烯烃产品选择性和活性。存在诱导期表明，在特定激活或反应条件下形成了真实的BO活性位点。2-D材料中的边沿活性位点密度较低限制了基于B的催化剂的进一步催化活性提升，需要策略如预氧改性来提高性能。复合催化剂，如h-BNxIn2O3，利用强金属氧化物-支撑相互作用（SMOSI）效应不仅加强了h-BN的层间力，如同钉一样，而且减弱了BN键对O·的亲和力，从而增强整体催化效率。
