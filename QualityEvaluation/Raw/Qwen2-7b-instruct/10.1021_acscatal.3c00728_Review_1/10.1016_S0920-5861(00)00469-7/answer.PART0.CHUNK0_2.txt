3.1. Effects of the support pre-calcination and the catalyst activation
Table 2 shows the reactivity and product selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime over a series of 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350. The activation temperature of these catalysts is 350C, which was the most frequently used activation temperature in many works for supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[12] . The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime is clearly seen to increase with increasing PCT up to 300C, further increase in PCT results in lowering the oxime conversion. On the other hand, the increase in PCT results steadily in increase of the selectivity for the desired lactam. While the lactam selectivity is less than 50% when the catalyst is prepared directly with the zirconyl hydroxide dried at 110C (PCT=110C), it is improved to more than 90% when the PCT is 350C. When the catalyst is made with a PCT=700C, the lactam selectivity can be as high as 98%.

3.2. Effect of the boria load
Two samples of the support pre-calcined at 300 and 500C, respectively, are used for optimizing of the boria load. After the impregnation with different load levels of boria (25%), the two series of catalyst samples obtained are activated by calcination at 600 and 350C, respectively, and, they are called B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 and B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalysts. As it appears in Fig. 2 , the change of boria load shows different effects on the activity and selectivity of the Beckmann rearrangement. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series ( Fig. 2 a), it is ca. 12% (between 10 and 13.6% B2O3) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 ( Fig. 2 b) ones. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities.

4.2. Optimization of the reaction atmosphere
The present observation that non-polar solvents are beneficial while the polar alcohol solvents are harmful to the Beckmann reaction agrees well with the work of Landis and Venuto [3] on zeolite catalysts with rare earth or transition metal cations. It differs, however, from recent works over high-silica zeolite [10] ,[23] and mesoporous zeotype catalysts [24] . This difference may arise from the different requirement for acidity of the active sites with zeolite [10] ,[11] ,[23] ,[24] and supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[14] ,[15] .

The support pre-calcination temperature significantly impacts the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst in the Beckmann rearrangement. Increasing the pre-calcination temperature up to 300°C enhances the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime, while a further increase leads to a reduction in conversion. At the same time, the selectivity for the desired lactam increases steadily with higher pre-calcination temperatures. Specifically, the lactam selectivity improves from below 50% to over 90% when the pre-calcination temperature rises from 110°C to 350°C. At a pre-calcination temperature of 700°C, the lactam selectivity reaches 98%. The boria load also affects the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. A maximum oxime conversion is observed on the catalyst with a 10% boria load for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series, whereas for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 sample series, the optimal boria load ranges from 10 to 13.6%. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases with the boria load up to these optimal levels. Non-polar solvents are advantageous, while polar alcohol solvents are detrimental to the Beckmann reaction. This finding aligns with previous studies on zeolite catalysts with rare earth or transition metal cations, but differs from recent works involving high-silica zeolite and mesoporous zeotype catalysts. These discrepancies might stem from the distinct requirements for acidity of active sites in zeolite and supported boria catalysts.

支撑物预烧结温度对催化剂在Beckmann重排反应中的转化率和选择性产生显著影响。随着预烧结温度提高至300°C，环己酮肟的转化率增加，而进一步升高则导致转化率下降。同时，目标乳酸的高选择性随着预烧结温度的增加而稳定提升。具体而言，当预烧结温度从110°C升至350°C时，乳酸的选择性从低于50%提升至超过90%。在700°C的预烧结温度下，乳酸选择性达到98%。硼酸负载也影响催化剂的活性和选择性。对于B2O3/ZrO2-500-350样本系列，最佳硼酸负载为10%，而对于B2O3/ZrO2-300-600样本系列，最佳硼酸负载范围约为10至13.6%。令人惊讶的是，在这些最佳催化活性水平上，乳酸选择性随硼酸负载的增加而增加。非极性溶剂对Beckmann反应有利，而极性醇类溶剂对其有害。这一发现与之前关于具有稀土或过渡金属离子的沸石催化剂的研究结果相吻合，但与涉及高硅沸石和介孔沸石催化剂的近期工作存在差异。这些差异可能源于沸石和支持型硼酸催化剂对活性位点酸性的不同要求。
