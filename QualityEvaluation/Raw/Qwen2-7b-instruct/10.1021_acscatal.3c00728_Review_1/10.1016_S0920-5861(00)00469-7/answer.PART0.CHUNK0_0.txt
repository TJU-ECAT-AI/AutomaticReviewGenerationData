Table 2 shows the reactivity and product selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime over a series of 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350. The activation temperature of these catalysts is 350C, which was the most frequently used activation temperature in many works for supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[12] . The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime is clearly seen to increase with increasing PCT up to 300C, further increase in PCT results in lowering the oxime conversion. On the other hand, the increase in PCT results steadily in increase of the selectivity for the desired lactam. While the lactam selectivity is less than 50% when the catalyst is prepared directly with the zirconyl hydroxide dried at 110C (PCT=110C), it is improved to more than 90% when the PCT is 350C. When the catalyst is made with a PCT=700C, the lactam selectivity can be as high as 98%.

Table 3 compares the PCT effects on the Beckmann reaction over the catalysts that are calcined with CAT=250, 500, and 600C, respectively. The boria load in these catalysts are kept at the level of 9.310 wt.%. These data indicate that the effects of PCT observed with the 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350 catalysts are held when the CAT is no higher than 500C. It is remarkable, however, that catalyst activation at 600C results, irrespective of the pre-calcinations, in very high selectivity for the desired lactam (9697%).

Fig. 1 summarizes the effects of CAT and PCT on the lactam synthesis. It is clear that the PCT is determinative for the catalysis when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C. With this limitation, maximum lactam yields are obtained with PCT=350500C. This effect of PCT disappears when the late catalyst activation is done with CAT=600C.

Fig. 2 shows the effect of boria load on the oxime conversion and lactam selectivity with B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 and B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 catalysts. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series, it is ca. 12% (between 10 and 13.6% B2O3) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 ones. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities. Beyond these levels of boria load the lactam selectivity becomes hardly affected.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of solvents on the averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity of Beckmann reaction during 6 h TOS. The averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity levels are at 8590 and 9597%, respectively, when the non-polar solvent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or acetone is used for dissolving the oxime reactant. In contrast, the selectivity to the desired lactam becomes almost totally lost when the non-polar solvent is replaced by polar alcohol, like methanol and ethanol, though the oxime conversion can be kept fairly high.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of changing the reaction carrier gas is shown. Apparently, nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 are the most favorable carrier gases. On the other hand, the use of basic ammonia for the carrier gas causes to lose the catalyst activity as well as the selectivity to the desired lactam.

Fig. 6 shows the time course of three different combinations. We use solvent/carrier-gas to define the combinations, e.g. benzene/N2 refers to the conventional combination that has most frequently been used for the Beckmann reaction in most of this and the literature works [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] . Apparently, the change of the carrier gas from the conventional N2 to the CO2, while keeping the benzene solvent unchanged, results remarkably in preventing the catalyst deactivation and in enhancing the lactam selectivity. The most remarkable effects appear when the conventional combination (benzene/N2) is changed to the acetone/CO2 combination. In the latter case, the catalyst deactivation is controlled to less than 10% in 9 h TOS, and selectivity to the lactam remains as high as 98% during the whole reaction period.
