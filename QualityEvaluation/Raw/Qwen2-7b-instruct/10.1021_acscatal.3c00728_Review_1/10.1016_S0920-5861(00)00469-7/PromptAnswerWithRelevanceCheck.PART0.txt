Table 2 shows the reactivity and product selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime over a series of 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350. The activation temperature of these catalysts is 350C, which was the most frequently used activation temperature in many works for supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[12] . The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime is clearly seen to increase with increasing PCT up to 300C, further increase in PCT results in lowering the oxime conversion. On the other hand, the increase in PCT results steadily in increase of the selectivity for the desired lactam. While the lactam selectivity is less than 50% when the catalyst is prepared directly with the zirconyl hydroxide dried at 110C (PCT=110C), it is improved to more than 90% when the PCT is 350C. When the catalyst is made with a PCT=700C, the lactam selectivity can be as high as 98%.

Table 3 compares the PCT effects on the Beckmann reaction over the catalysts that are calcined with CAT=250, 500, and 600C, respectively. The boria load in these catalysts are kept at the level of 9.310 wt.%. These data indicate that the effects of PCT observed with the 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350 catalysts are held when the CAT is no higher than 500C. It is remarkable, however, that catalyst activation at 600C results, irrespective of the pre-calcinations, in very high selectivity for the desired lactam (9697%).

Fig. 1 summarizes the effects of CAT and PCT on the lactam synthesis. It is clear that the PCT is determinative for the catalysis when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C. With this limitation, maximum lactam yields are obtained with PCT=350500C. This effect of PCT disappears when the late catalyst activation is done with CAT=600C.

Fig. 2 shows the effect of boria load on the oxime conversion and lactam selectivity with B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 and B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 catalysts. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series, it is ca. 12% (between 10 and 13.6% B2O3) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 ones. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities. Beyond these levels of boria load the lactam selectivity becomes hardly affected.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of solvents on the averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity of Beckmann reaction during 6 h TOS. The averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity levels are at 8590 and 9597%, respectively, when the non-polar solvent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or acetone is used for dissolving the oxime reactant. In contrast, the selectivity to the desired lactam becomes almost totally lost when the non-polar solvent is replaced by polar alcohol, like methanol and ethanol, though the oxime conversion can be kept fairly high.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of changing the reaction carrier gas is shown. Apparently, nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 are the most favorable carrier gases. On the other hand, the use of basic ammonia for the carrier gas causes to lose the catalyst activity as well as the selectivity to the desired lactam.

Fig. 6 shows the time course of three different combinations. We use solvent/carrier-gas to define the combinations, e.g. benzene/N2 refers to the conventional combination that has most frequently been used for the Beckmann reaction in most of this and the literature works [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] . Apparently, the change of the carrier gas from the conventional N2 to the CO2, while keeping the benzene solvent unchanged, results remarkably in preventing the catalyst deactivation and in enhancing the lactam selectivity. The most remarkable effects appear when the conventional combination (benzene/N2) is changed to the acetone/CO2 combination. In the latter case, the catalyst deactivation is controlled to less than 10% in 9 h TOS, and selectivity to the lactam remains as high as 98% during the whole reaction period.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the performance of the catalyst can be optimized by selecting the appropriate reaction atmosphere, which could be as crucial as choosing the right catalyst itself. Proper combinations of solvents and carrier gases can also enhance the lactam synthesis process. Additionally, the preparation methods, including the temperature histories of the support and the supported catalyst, play a decisive role in catalyst-support interaction. The choice of reaction conditions, such as temperature, affects the catalytic efficiency. By examining the effects of support pre-calcination and catalyst activation, researchers can improve the lactam yield and selectivity. Furthermore, the presence of various byproducts, such as cyclohexanone, cyclohexenone, tetrahydrocarbazide, and octahydrophenazine, can be minimized by adjusting the catalyst preparation parameters. The optimization of the boria load on the zirconia support also impacts the surface area and porosity, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

3.1. Effects of the support pre-calcination and the catalyst activation
Table 2 shows the reactivity and product selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime over a series of 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350. The activation temperature of these catalysts is 350C, which was the most frequently used activation temperature in many works for supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[12] . The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime is clearly seen to increase with increasing PCT up to 300C, further increase in PCT results in lowering the oxime conversion. On the other hand, the increase in PCT results steadily in increase of the selectivity for the desired lactam. While the lactam selectivity is less than 50% when the catalyst is prepared directly with the zirconyl hydroxide dried at 110C (PCT=110C), it is improved to more than 90% when the PCT is 350C. When the catalyst is made with a PCT=700C, the lactam selectivity can be as high as 98%.

3.2. Effect of the boria load
Two samples of the support pre-calcined at 300 and 500C, respectively, are used for optimizing of the boria load. After the impregnation with different load levels of boria (25%), the two series of catalyst samples obtained are activated by calcination at 600 and 350C, respectively, and, they are called B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 and B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalysts. As it appears in Fig. 2 , the change of boria load shows different effects on the activity and selectivity of the Beckmann rearrangement. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series ( Fig. 2 a), it is ca. 12% (between 10 and 13.6% B2O3) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 ( Fig. 2 b) ones. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities.

4.2. Optimization of the reaction atmosphere
The present observation that non-polar solvents are beneficial while the polar alcohol solvents are harmful to the Beckmann reaction agrees well with the work of Landis and Venuto [3] on zeolite catalysts with rare earth or transition metal cations. It differs, however, from recent works over high-silica zeolite [10] ,[23] and mesoporous zeotype catalysts [24] . This difference may arise from the different requirement for acidity of the active sites with zeolite [10] ,[11] ,[23] ,[24] and supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[14] ,[15] .

The support pre-calcination temperature significantly impacts the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst in the Beckmann rearrangement. Increasing the pre-calcination temperature up to 300°C enhances the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime, while a further increase leads to a reduction in conversion. At the same time, the selectivity for the desired lactam increases steadily with higher pre-calcination temperatures. Specifically, the lactam selectivity improves from below 50% to over 90% when the pre-calcination temperature rises from 110°C to 350°C. At a pre-calcination temperature of 700°C, the lactam selectivity reaches 98%. The boria load also affects the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. A maximum oxime conversion is observed on the catalyst with a 10% boria load for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series, whereas for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 sample series, the optimal boria load ranges from 10 to 13.6%. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases with the boria load up to these optimal levels. Non-polar solvents are advantageous, while polar alcohol solvents are detrimental to the Beckmann reaction. This finding aligns with previous studies on zeolite catalysts with rare earth or transition metal cations, but differs from recent works involving high-silica zeolite and mesoporous zeotype catalysts. These discrepancies might stem from the distinct requirements for acidity of active sites in zeolite and supported boria catalysts.

支撑物预烧结温度对催化剂在Beckmann重排反应中的转化率和选择性产生显著影响。随着预烧结温度提高至300°C，环己酮肟的转化率增加，而进一步升高则导致转化率下降。同时，目标乳酸的高选择性随着预烧结温度的增加而稳定提升。具体而言，当预烧结温度从110°C升至350°C时，乳酸的选择性从低于50%提升至超过90%。在700°C的预烧结温度下，乳酸选择性达到98%。硼酸负载也影响催化剂的活性和选择性。对于B2O3/ZrO2-500-350样本系列，最佳硼酸负载为10%，而对于B2O3/ZrO2-300-600样本系列，最佳硼酸负载范围约为10至13.6%。令人惊讶的是，在这些最佳催化活性水平上，乳酸选择性随硼酸负载的增加而增加。非极性溶剂对Beckmann反应有利，而极性醇类溶剂对其有害。这一发现与之前关于具有稀土或过渡金属离子的沸石催化剂的研究结果相吻合，但与涉及高硅沸石和介孔沸石催化剂的近期工作存在差异。这些差异可能源于沸石和支持型硼酸催化剂对活性位点酸性的不同要求。

Fig. 1 summarizes the effects of CAT and PCT on the lactam synthesis. It is clear that the PCT is determinative for the catalysis when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C. With this limitation, maximum lactam yields are obtained with PCT=350500C. This effect of PCT disappears when the late catalyst activation is done with CAT=600C.

3.2. Effect of the boria load

Two samples of the support pre-calcined at 300 and 500C, respectively, are used for optimizing of the boria load. After the impregnation with different load levels of boria (25%), the two series of catalyst samples obtained are activated by calcination at 600 and 350C, respectively, and, they are called B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 and B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalysts. As it appears in Fig. 2 , the change of boria load shows different effects on the activity and selectivity of the Beckmann rearrangement. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series ( Fig. 2 a), it is ca. 12% (between 10 and 13.6% B2O3) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 ( Fig. 2 b) ones. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities. Beyond these levels of boria load the lactam selectivity becomes hardly affected.

In Fig. 3 , variations of the lactam yield in relation to TOS are compared for the two series of catalyst samples. Interestingly, the catalysts with optimized levels of the boria load show also the slowest deactivation during the reaction. Except with low levels of the boria load, e.g. 5%, the catalyst deactivation is always seen to induce a slow increase in the formation of the byproducts (not shown in the figure), especially cyclohexanone, though the overall change in the lactam selectivity does not exceed 8% [15] .

3.3. Effect of the reaction atmosphere: solvents and carrier gases

One of the optimized catalysts, 10% B2O3/ZrO2-500-350, was used to study the effects of the reaction solvents and carrier gases.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of solvents on the averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity of Beckmann reaction during 6 h TOS. The averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity levels are at 8590 and 9597%, respectively, when the non-polar solvent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or acetone is used for dissolving the oxime reactant. In contrast, the selectivity to the desired lactam becomes almost totally lost when the non-polar solvent is replaced by polar alcohol, like methanol and ethanol, though the oxime conversion can be kept fairly high. A decrease of the polarity by the use of hexan-1-ol for the solvent produces 60% selectivity for the lactam in the first hour. This lactam selectivity is reduced to 20% at and is totally diminished at longer TOS. Also, the use of hexan-1-ol for the solvent induces much faster deactivation of the catalyst.

The effect of changing the reaction carrier gas is shown in Fig. 5 . Apparently, nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 are the most favorable carrier gases. On the other hand, the use of basic ammonia for the carrier gas causes to lose the catalyst activity as well as the selectivity to the desired lactam.

Attempts are made to investigate the combinatorial effects of solvents and carrier gases.

Fig. 6 shows the time course of three different combinations. We use solvent/carrier-gas to define the combinations, e.g. benzene/N2 refers to the conventional combination that has most frequently been used for the Beckmann reaction in most of this and the literature works [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] . Apparently, the change of the carrier gas from the conventional N2 to the CO2, while keeping the benzene solvent unchanged, results remarkably in preventing the catalyst deactivation and in enhancing the lactam selectivity. The most remarkable effects appear when the conventional combination (benzene/N2) is changed to the acetone/CO2 combination. In the latter case, the catalyst deactivation is controlled to less than 10% in 9 h TOS, and selectivity to the lactam remains as high as 98% during the whole reaction period.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime increases with increasing pre-calcination temperature (PCT) up to 300°C, beyond which it decreases. This is attributed to the enhancement of the selectivity for the desired lactam product. The lactam selectivity is notably improved when the PCT is 350°C, reaching over 90%, compared to less than 50% at 110°C PCT. Moreover, the study indicates that the effects of PCT are retained when the catalyst activation temperature (CAT) is no higher than 500°C. However, at 600°C CAT, regardless of the pre-calcination temperatures, the lactam selectivity is remarkably high (96-97%). The study also highlights that the boria load affects the activity and selectivity, with a maximum oxime conversion at around 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series and a similar range (10-13.6%) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 series. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases with the boria load up to the optimized levels. Beyond these levels, the lactam selectivity becomes unaffected. The optimization of the reaction atmosphere through the selection of solvents and carrier gases is shown to significantly impact the oxime conversion and lactam selectivity. Non-polar solvents like benzene, cyclohexane, and acetone are beneficial, maintaining high levels of oxime conversion and lactam selectivity (95-97%). In contrast, polar alcohols such as methanol and ethanol result in a total loss of lactam selectivity. The use of hexan-1-ol as a solvent leads to a decrease in lactam selectivity and faster catalyst deactivation. Carrier gases also play a crucial role, with nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 being the most favorable. Basic ammonia as a carrier gas leads to a loss of catalyst activity and selectivity. The study demonstrates that the optimal combination of solvent and carrier gas can prevent catalyst deactivation and enhance lactam selectivity, with the acetone/CO2 combination showing the most remarkable effects.

B催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能。研究表明，随着预煅烧温度（PCT）的增加至300°C，环己酮氧化物的转化率增加，超过此温度后则降低。这归因于目标乳酸盐产物选择性的增强。在350°C PCT下，乳酸盐选择性显著提高，达到超过90%，与110°C PCT下的不到50%形成对比。此外，研究指出，在催化剂活化温度（CAT）不超过500°C时，PCT的影响得以保留。然而，在600°C CAT下，无论预煅烧温度如何，乳酸盐选择性显著提高（96-97%）。研究还表明，氧化铝负载影响活性和选择性，最大环己酮氧化物转化率出现在B2O3/ZrO2-500-350样品系列的约10% B2O3处，对于B2O3/ZrO2-300-600系列范围相似（10-13.6%）。令人惊讶的是，乳酸盐选择性随氧化铝负载增加至优化水平。超出这些负载水平后，乳酸盐选择性保持不变。通过选择溶剂和载气来优化反应气氛，显著影响环己酮氧化物转化率和乳酸盐选择性。非极性溶剂如苯、环己烷和乙酸酯对维持高环己酮氧化物转化率和乳酸盐选择性（95-97%）有益。相比之下，极性醇如甲醇和乙醇导致完全失去乳酸盐选择性。使用己烷-1-醇作为溶剂导致乳酸盐选择性和催化剂降解速率更快。载气也发挥关键作用，氮气和弱酸性CO2是最有利的选择。基本氨作为载气导致催化剂活性和选择性的损失。研究显示，溶剂和载气的最佳组合可以防止催化剂降解并增强乳酸盐选择性，其中乙酸酯/CO2组合显示出最显著的效果。

Table 2 shows the reactivity and product selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime over a series of 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350. The activation temperature of these catalysts is 350C, which was the most frequently used activation temperature in many works for supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[12] . The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime is clearly seen to increase with increasing PCT up to 300C, further increase in PCT results in lowering the oxime conversion. On the other hand, the increase in PCT results steadily in increase of the selectivity for the desired lactam. While the lactam selectivity is less than 50% when the catalyst is prepared directly with the zirconyl hydroxide dried at 110C (PCT=110C), it is improved to more than 90% when the PCT is 350C. When the catalyst is made with a PCT=700C, the lactam selectivity can be as high as 98%.

Table 3 compares the PCT effects on the Beckmann reaction over the catalysts that are calcined with CAT=250, 500, and 600C, respectively. The boria load in these catalysts are kept at the level of 9.310 wt.%. These data indicate that the effects of PCT observed with the 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350 catalysts are held when the CAT is no higher than 500C. It is remarkable, however, that catalyst activation at 600C results, irrespective of the pre-calcinations, in very high selectivity for the desired lactam (9697%).

Fig. 1 summarizes the effects of CAT and PCT on the lactam synthesis. It is clear that the PCT is determinative for the catalysis when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C. With this limitation, maximum lactam yields are obtained with PCT=350500C. This effect of PCT disappears when the late catalyst activation is done with CAT=600C.

Fig. 2 shows the effect of boria load on the oxime conversion and lactam selectivity with B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 and B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 catalysts. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series. The lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities. Beyond these levels of boria load the lactam selectivity becomes hardly affected.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of solvents on the averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity of Beckmann reaction during 6 h TOS. The averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity levels are at 8590 and 9597%, respectively, when the non-polar solvent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or acetone is used for dissolving the oxime reactant. In contrast, the selectivity to the desired lactam becomes almost totally lost when the non-polar solvent is replaced by polar alcohol, like methanol and ethanol, though the oxime conversion can be kept fairly high.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of changing the reaction carrier gas. Apparently, nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 are the most favorable carrier gases. On the other hand, the use of basic ammonia for the carrier gas causes to lose the catalyst activity as well as the selectivity to the desired lactam.

Fig. 6 shows the time course of three different combinations. The change of the carrier gas from the conventional N2 to the CO2, while keeping the benzene solvent unchanged, results remarkably in preventing the catalyst deactivation and in enhancing the lactam selectivity. The most remarkable effects appear when the conventional combination (benzene/N2) is changed to the acetone/CO2 combination. In the latter case, the catalyst deactivation is controlled to less than 10% in 9 h TOS, and selectivity to the lactam remains as high as 98% during the whole reaction period.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a critical role in influencing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The literature provides evidence that adjusting the support pre-calcination temperature (PCT) and the catalyst activation temperature (CAT) can optimize the catalyst's performance. Specifically, increasing the PCT up to 300°C enhances the reactivity of the catalyst, leading to a higher conversion of cyclohexanone oxime. However, beyond 300°C, the PCT decreases the oxime conversion, possibly due to changes in the catalyst's surface area and pore structure, which affects the dispersion of boron oxide (B2O3) layers on the zirconia support. Activating the catalyst at a higher temperature (600°C) eliminates the PCT effect, suggesting that the high temperature helps redistribute the B2O3 layers, resulting in a catalyst with improved selectivity towards the desired lactam product. The literature also highlights the importance of selecting the right solvent and carrier gas for the reaction atmosphere, as non-polar solvents enhance the lactam selectivity, whereas polar alcohols reduce it. Combining the effects of solvent and carrier gas can lead to optimized reaction conditions, resulting in better catalyst stability and selectivity for lactam formation. By understanding these relationships, researchers can develop more efficient catalysts tailored for commercial applications in ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有重要影响。理解这些独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商用催化剂至关重要。文献表明，通过调整载体预煅烧温度（PCT）和催化剂活化温度（CAT）可以优化催化剂性能。具体而言，将PCT增加至300°C可以提高催化剂的活性，从而增加环己酮肟的转化率。然而，在超过300°C后，PCT会降低肟的转化率，这可能与催化剂表面区域和孔结构的变化有关，影响了氧化硼（B2O3）层在锆基底上的分散。激活催化剂至较高温度（600°C）可以消除PCT效应，这表明高温有助于重新分布B2O3层，导致催化剂具有更高的乳酸酯选择性。文献还强调了选择合适的溶剂和载气对于反应气氛的重要性，非极性溶剂能增强乳酸酯的选择性，而极性醇则会降低它。结合溶剂和载气的作用效果可以优化反应条件，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和乳酸酯的形成选择性。通过理解这些关系，研究人员可以开发出更适合商用应用的、更加高效的催化剂。
