[1] "A remarkable benefit for the lactam synthesis is observed with proper combination of the solvents and carrier gases."
[2] "The property of zirconia-supported catalyst is subject to the preparation methods. Temperature (calcination) histories of the support and the supported catalyst could be decisive for catalyst-support interaction."
[3] "In this present work, all the reaction tests are conducted at 300C to examine effects of the support pre-calcination and the catalyst activation."
[4] "The undesirable products are dominated by cyclohexanone and cyclohexenone. Other byproducts of significance are tetrahydrocarbazide and octahydrophenazine."
[5] "As shown in Fig. 7 , the influence of the borial load on the surface area and porosity of the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 samples is exactly the same as for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 ones."
[6] "For the present gas-phase Beckmann reaction, the selection of the reaction atmosphere could be as important as the selection of catalyst."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the performance of the catalyst can be optimized by selecting the appropriate reaction atmosphere, which could be as crucial as choosing the right catalyst itself. Proper combinations of solvents and carrier gases can also enhance the lactam synthesis process. Additionally, the preparation methods, including the temperature histories of the support and the supported catalyst, play a decisive role in catalyst-support interaction. The choice of reaction conditions, such as temperature, affects the catalytic efficiency. By examining the effects of support pre-calcination and catalyst activation, researchers can improve the lactam yield and selectivity. Furthermore, the presence of various byproducts, such as cyclohexanone, cyclohexenone, tetrahydrocarbazide, and octahydrophenazine, can be minimized by adjusting the catalyst preparation parameters. The optimization of the boria load on the zirconia support also impacts the surface area and porosity, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity and selectivity.
