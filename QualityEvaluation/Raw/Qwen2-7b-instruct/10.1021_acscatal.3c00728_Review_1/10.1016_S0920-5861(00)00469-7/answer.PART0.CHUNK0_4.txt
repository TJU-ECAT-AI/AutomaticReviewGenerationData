Table 2 shows the reactivity and product selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime over a series of 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350. The activation temperature of these catalysts is 350C, which was the most frequently used activation temperature in many works for supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[12] . The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime is clearly seen to increase with increasing PCT up to 300C, further increase in PCT results in lowering the oxime conversion. On the other hand, the increase in PCT results steadily in increase of the selectivity for the desired lactam. While the lactam selectivity is less than 50% when the catalyst is prepared directly with the zirconyl hydroxide dried at 110C (PCT=110C), it is improved to more than 90% when the PCT is 350C. When the catalyst is made with a PCT=700C, the lactam selectivity can be as high as 98%.

Table 3 compares the PCT effects on the Beckmann reaction over the catalysts that are calcined with CAT=250, 500, and 600C, respectively. The boria load in these catalysts are kept at the level of 9.310 wt.%. These data indicate that the effects of PCT observed with the 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350 catalysts are held when the CAT is no higher than 500C. It is remarkable, however, that catalyst activation at 600C results, irrespective of the pre-calcinations, in very high selectivity for the desired lactam (9697%).

Fig. 1 summarizes the effects of CAT and PCT on the lactam synthesis. It is clear that the PCT is determinative for the catalysis when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C. With this limitation, maximum lactam yields are obtained with PCT=350500C. This effect of PCT disappears when the late catalyst activation is done with CAT=600C.

Fig. 2 shows the effect of boria load on the oxime conversion and lactam selectivity with B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 and B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 catalysts. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series. The lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities. Beyond these levels of boria load the lactam selectivity becomes hardly affected.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of solvents on the averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity of Beckmann reaction during 6 h TOS. The averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity levels are at 8590 and 9597%, respectively, when the non-polar solvent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or acetone is used for dissolving the oxime reactant. In contrast, the selectivity to the desired lactam becomes almost totally lost when the non-polar solvent is replaced by polar alcohol, like methanol and ethanol, though the oxime conversion can be kept fairly high.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of changing the reaction carrier gas. Apparently, nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 are the most favorable carrier gases. On the other hand, the use of basic ammonia for the carrier gas causes to lose the catalyst activity as well as the selectivity to the desired lactam.

Fig. 6 shows the time course of three different combinations. The change of the carrier gas from the conventional N2 to the CO2, while keeping the benzene solvent unchanged, results remarkably in preventing the catalyst deactivation and in enhancing the lactam selectivity. The most remarkable effects appear when the conventional combination (benzene/N2) is changed to the acetone/CO2 combination. In the latter case, the catalyst deactivation is controlled to less than 10% in 9 h TOS, and selectivity to the lactam remains as high as 98% during the whole reaction period.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a critical role in influencing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The literature provides evidence that adjusting the support pre-calcination temperature (PCT) and the catalyst activation temperature (CAT) can optimize the catalyst's performance. Specifically, increasing the PCT up to 300°C enhances the reactivity of the catalyst, leading to a higher conversion of cyclohexanone oxime. However, beyond 300°C, the PCT decreases the oxime conversion, possibly due to changes in the catalyst's surface area and pore structure, which affects the dispersion of boron oxide (B2O3) layers on the zirconia support. Activating the catalyst at a higher temperature (600°C) eliminates the PCT effect, suggesting that the high temperature helps redistribute the B2O3 layers, resulting in a catalyst with improved selectivity towards the desired lactam product. The literature also highlights the importance of selecting the right solvent and carrier gas for the reaction atmosphere, as non-polar solvents enhance the lactam selectivity, whereas polar alcohols reduce it. Combining the effects of solvent and carrier gas can lead to optimized reaction conditions, resulting in better catalyst stability and selectivity for lactam formation. By understanding these relationships, researchers can develop more efficient catalysts tailored for commercial applications in ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有重要影响。理解这些独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商用催化剂至关重要。文献表明，通过调整载体预煅烧温度（PCT）和催化剂活化温度（CAT）可以优化催化剂性能。具体而言，将PCT增加至300°C可以提高催化剂的活性，从而增加环己酮肟的转化率。然而，在超过300°C后，PCT会降低肟的转化率，这可能与催化剂表面区域和孔结构的变化有关，影响了氧化硼（B2O3）层在锆基底上的分散。激活催化剂至较高温度（600°C）可以消除PCT效应，这表明高温有助于重新分布B2O3层，导致催化剂具有更高的乳酸酯选择性。文献还强调了选择合适的溶剂和载气对于反应气氛的重要性，非极性溶剂能增强乳酸酯的选择性，而极性醇则会降低它。结合溶剂和载气的作用效果可以优化反应条件，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和乳酸酯的形成选择性。通过理解这些关系，研究人员可以开发出更适合商用应用的、更加高效的催化剂。
