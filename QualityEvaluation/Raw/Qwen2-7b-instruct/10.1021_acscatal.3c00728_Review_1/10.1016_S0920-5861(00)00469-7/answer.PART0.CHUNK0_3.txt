3.1. Effects of the support pre-calcination and the catalyst activation

Table 2 shows the reactivity and product selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime over a series of 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350. The activation temperature of these catalysts is 350C, which was the most frequently used activation temperature in many works for supported boria catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[12] . The conversion of cyclohexanone oxime is clearly seen to increase with increasing PCT up to 300C, further increase in PCT results in lowering the oxime conversion. On the other hand, the increase in PCT results steadily in increase of the selectivity for the desired lactam. While the lactam selectivity is less than 50% when the catalyst is prepared directly with the zirconyl hydroxide dried at 110C (PCT=110C), it is improved to more than 90% when the PCT is 350C. When the catalyst is made with a PCT=700C, the lactam selectivity can be as high as 98%.

Table 3 compares the PCT effects on the Beckmann reaction over the catalysts that are calcined with CAT=250, 500, and 600C, respectively. The boria load in these catalysts are kept at the level of 9.310 wt.%. These data indicate that the effects of PCT observed with the 10% B2O3/ZrO2-PCT-350 catalysts are held when the CAT is no higher than 500C. It is remarkable, however, that catalyst activation at 600C results, irrespective of the pre-calcinations, in very high selectivity for the desired lactam (9697%).

Fig. 1 summarizes the effects of CAT and PCT on the lactam synthesis. It is clear that the PCT is determinative for the catalysis when the CAT is limited no higher than 500C. With this limitation, maximum lactam yields are obtained with PCT=350500C. This effect of PCT disappears when the late catalyst activation is done with CAT=600C.

3.2. Effect of the boria load

Two samples of the support pre-calcined at 300 and 500C, respectively, are used for optimizing of the boria load. After the impregnation with different load levels of boria (25%), the two series of catalyst samples obtained are activated by calcination at 600 and 350C, respectively, and, they are called B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 and B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 catalysts. As it appears in Fig. 2 , the change of boria load shows different effects on the activity and selectivity of the Beckmann rearrangement. A maximum oxime conversion appears on the catalyst with 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series ( Fig. 2 a), it is ca. 12% (between 10 and 13.6% B2O3) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 ( Fig. 2 b) ones. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases also with the boria load up to these optimum load levels for the maximum catalyst activities. Beyond these levels of boria load the lactam selectivity becomes hardly affected.

In Fig. 3 , variations of the lactam yield in relation to TOS are compared for the two series of catalyst samples. Interestingly, the catalysts with optimized levels of the boria load show also the slowest deactivation during the reaction. Except with low levels of the boria load, e.g. 5%, the catalyst deactivation is always seen to induce a slow increase in the formation of the byproducts (not shown in the figure), especially cyclohexanone, though the overall change in the lactam selectivity does not exceed 8% [15] .

3.3. Effect of the reaction atmosphere: solvents and carrier gases

One of the optimized catalysts, 10% B2O3/ZrO2-500-350, was used to study the effects of the reaction solvents and carrier gases.

Fig. 4 shows the effect of solvents on the averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity of Beckmann reaction during 6 h TOS. The averaged oxime conversion and lactam selectivity levels are at 8590 and 9597%, respectively, when the non-polar solvent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or acetone is used for dissolving the oxime reactant. In contrast, the selectivity to the desired lactam becomes almost totally lost when the non-polar solvent is replaced by polar alcohol, like methanol and ethanol, though the oxime conversion can be kept fairly high. A decrease of the polarity by the use of hexan-1-ol for the solvent produces 60% selectivity for the lactam in the first hour. This lactam selectivity is reduced to 20% at and is totally diminished at longer TOS. Also, the use of hexan-1-ol for the solvent induces much faster deactivation of the catalyst.

The effect of changing the reaction carrier gas is shown in Fig. 5 . Apparently, nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 are the most favorable carrier gases. On the other hand, the use of basic ammonia for the carrier gas causes to lose the catalyst activity as well as the selectivity to the desired lactam.

Attempts are made to investigate the combinatorial effects of solvents and carrier gases.

Fig. 6 shows the time course of three different combinations. We use solvent/carrier-gas to define the combinations, e.g. benzene/N2 refers to the conventional combination that has most frequently been used for the Beckmann reaction in most of this and the literature works [2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] . Apparently, the change of the carrier gas from the conventional N2 to the CO2, while keeping the benzene solvent unchanged, results remarkably in preventing the catalyst deactivation and in enhancing the lactam selectivity. The most remarkable effects appear when the conventional combination (benzene/N2) is changed to the acetone/CO2 combination. In the latter case, the catalyst deactivation is controlled to less than 10% in 9 h TOS, and selectivity to the lactam remains as high as 98% during the whole reaction period.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime increases with increasing pre-calcination temperature (PCT) up to 300°C, beyond which it decreases. This is attributed to the enhancement of the selectivity for the desired lactam product. The lactam selectivity is notably improved when the PCT is 350°C, reaching over 90%, compared to less than 50% at 110°C PCT. Moreover, the study indicates that the effects of PCT are retained when the catalyst activation temperature (CAT) is no higher than 500°C. However, at 600°C CAT, regardless of the pre-calcination temperatures, the lactam selectivity is remarkably high (96-97%). The study also highlights that the boria load affects the activity and selectivity, with a maximum oxime conversion at around 10% B2O3 for the B2O3/ZrO2-500-350 sample series and a similar range (10-13.6%) for the B2O3/ZrO2-300-600 series. Surprisingly, the lactam selectivity increases with the boria load up to the optimized levels. Beyond these levels, the lactam selectivity becomes unaffected. The optimization of the reaction atmosphere through the selection of solvents and carrier gases is shown to significantly impact the oxime conversion and lactam selectivity. Non-polar solvents like benzene, cyclohexane, and acetone are beneficial, maintaining high levels of oxime conversion and lactam selectivity (95-97%). In contrast, polar alcohols such as methanol and ethanol result in a total loss of lactam selectivity. The use of hexan-1-ol as a solvent leads to a decrease in lactam selectivity and faster catalyst deactivation. Carrier gases also play a crucial role, with nitrogen and weakly acidic CO2 being the most favorable. Basic ammonia as a carrier gas leads to a loss of catalyst activity and selectivity. The study demonstrates that the optimal combination of solvent and carrier gas can prevent catalyst deactivation and enhance lactam selectivity, with the acetone/CO2 combination showing the most remarkable effects.

B催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能。研究表明，随着预煅烧温度（PCT）的增加至300°C，环己酮氧化物的转化率增加，超过此温度后则降低。这归因于目标乳酸盐产物选择性的增强。在350°C PCT下，乳酸盐选择性显著提高，达到超过90%，与110°C PCT下的不到50%形成对比。此外，研究指出，在催化剂活化温度（CAT）不超过500°C时，PCT的影响得以保留。然而，在600°C CAT下，无论预煅烧温度如何，乳酸盐选择性显著提高（96-97%）。研究还表明，氧化铝负载影响活性和选择性，最大环己酮氧化物转化率出现在B2O3/ZrO2-500-350样品系列的约10% B2O3处，对于B2O3/ZrO2-300-600系列范围相似（10-13.6%）。令人惊讶的是，乳酸盐选择性随氧化铝负载增加至优化水平。超出这些负载水平后，乳酸盐选择性保持不变。通过选择溶剂和载气来优化反应气氛，显著影响环己酮氧化物转化率和乳酸盐选择性。非极性溶剂如苯、环己烷和乙酸酯对维持高环己酮氧化物转化率和乳酸盐选择性（95-97%）有益。相比之下，极性醇如甲醇和乙醇导致完全失去乳酸盐选择性。使用己烷-1-醇作为溶剂导致乳酸盐选择性和催化剂降解速率更快。载气也发挥关键作用，氮气和弱酸性CO2是最有利的选择。基本氨作为载气导致催化剂活性和选择性的损失。研究显示，溶剂和载气的最佳组合可以防止催化剂降解并增强乳酸盐选择性，其中乙酸酯/CO2组合显示出最显著的效果。
