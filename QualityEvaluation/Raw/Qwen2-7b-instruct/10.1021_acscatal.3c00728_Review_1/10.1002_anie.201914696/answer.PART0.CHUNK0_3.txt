[1] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[2] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[3] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[4] "This study advances the understanding of boron species involved in the propane ODH mechanism and will direct future work in understanding the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts."

Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts plays a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the presence of 1-D edge active sites has been shown to significantly influence catalytic efficiency. The literature highlights that the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, are critical in determining the effectiveness of B-based catalysts. By elucidating these specific features, researchers can design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The study contributes to the field by advancing our understanding of the molecular origins of highly selective ODHP catalysts, which is essential for the development of improved catalysts with enhanced performance. Future research aims to explore the surface mobility and identify the precise types of boron-boron interactions required to form active ODHP catalysts.
