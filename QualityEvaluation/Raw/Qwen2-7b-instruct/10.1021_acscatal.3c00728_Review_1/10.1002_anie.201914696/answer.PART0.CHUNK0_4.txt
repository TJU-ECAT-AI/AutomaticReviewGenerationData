"B-MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single-Site Catalysis"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This document discusses the synthesis and characterization of boron-containing B-MWW zeolite and its application as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. It is found that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units, which are inactive for ODH of propane.

[B-MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single-Site Catalysis]
"The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site in boron-based catalysts."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The lack of catalytic activity of B-MWW for propane ODH disproves the hypothesis that isolated boron species are the active site in boron-based catalysts.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
B-MWW对丙烷ODH的催化无活性反驳了硼基催化剂中孤立硼物种是活性位点的假设。

"In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In summary, the 11B chemical shifts indicate that nearly all boron atoms in B-MWW are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated from each other by more than 34 Å.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
总结来说，11B化学位移表明B-MWW中的几乎所有硼原子都被整合到框架中。SSNMR数据还表明，这些位点彼此间相隔超过34 Å。

"All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that inactive B-MWW mainly consists of isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, whereas the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
所有这些观察结果证实了以下假设：非活性B-MWW主要由整合到沸石骨架中的孤立硼位点组成，而活性ODH催化剂B/B-MWW则包含一些部分聚合的硼位点。
