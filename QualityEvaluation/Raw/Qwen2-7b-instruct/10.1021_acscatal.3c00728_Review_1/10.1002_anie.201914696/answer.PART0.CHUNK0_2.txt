[1] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."
[2] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."
[3] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."
[4] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts plays a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. In particular, the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contribute significantly to the efficiency of these catalysts for commercial applications. The study found that the B-MWW zeolite, despite having a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, did not show any ODHP conversion, indicating that isolated boron sites are not the active sites in boron-based catalysts. Instead, active boron-based catalysts require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity. This insight advances our understanding of the molecular origins of highly selective ODHP catalysts and guides future research towards designing more efficient catalysts.

理解B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能至关重要。特别是，1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制对这些催化剂在商业应用中的效率有重大贡献。研究表明，尽管B-MWW沸石的硼含量足以满足催化活性，但其并未表现出任何ODHP转化，这表明孤立的硼位不是硼基催化剂的活性位点。相反，活性硼基ODHP催化剂需要具有某些程度的B-O-B连接性的硼物种。这一发现深化了我们对高度选择性ODHP催化剂分子起源的理解，并指导未来研究设计更高效的催化剂。
