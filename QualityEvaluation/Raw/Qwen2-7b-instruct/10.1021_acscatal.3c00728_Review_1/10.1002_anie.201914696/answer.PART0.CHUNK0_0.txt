[B-MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single-Site Catalysis]
The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group.
Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels.
As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms.
The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity.
This study advances the understanding of boron species involved in the propane ODH mechanism and will direct future work in understanding the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts.
Further investigations are underway to determine the surface mobility and understand precisely which types of boron-boron interactions are required to form active ODH catalysts.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study found that B-MWW, with isolated boron sites, lacks catalytic activity for ODHP. In contrast, active catalysts like B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride show aggregated boron sites that rearrange under reaction conditions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms, especially concerning 1-D edge active sites, contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Future research aims to determine surface mobility and identify the specific boron-boron interactions needed for active ODHP catalyst formation.

在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应性能。研究发现，B-MWW中的孤立硼位点无法催化ODHP。相比之下，活性催化剂如B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和硼氮化物显示出在反应条件下重新排列的聚集硼位点。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制，特别是关于1-D边缘活性位点的特性，有助于设计更高效的商用催化剂。未来研究将确定表面流动性，并明确形成有效ODHP催化剂所需的特定硼-硼相互作用。
