The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in their performance during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. This is because the arrangement and structure of these sites affect how efficiently they can catalyze the reaction. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites are highlighted as having unique properties and reaction mechanisms that are important for designing more efficient catalysts suitable for commercial use.
