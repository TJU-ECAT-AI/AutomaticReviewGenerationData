The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The B2O3@BPO4 composite, with its sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, demonstrated exceptional activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions. The catalyst's productivity reached up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1, and it exhibited high stability at 550°C. The reaction kinetics followed Eley-Rideal, indicating second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane (PC3H8).
