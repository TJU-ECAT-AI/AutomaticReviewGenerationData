The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts. In the case of B2O3@BPO4, the tertiary aggregation during synthesis and the presence of melted B2O3 supported by BPO4 as an active species contribute to its exceptional catalytic activity and stability at high temperatures. The second-order rate dependence with respect to the partial pressure of propane further elucidates the efficiency of these active sites in the ODHP process.
