The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms associated with these sites, such as the ability of B2O3@BPO4 to exhibit excellent catalytic activity and long-time stability at 550 C, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The tertiary aggregation phenomenon observed during the formation of B2O3@BPO4 demonstrates the innovative approach to catalyst synthesis, leading to the development of high-temperature supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs) that surpass metal-based catalysts in terms of productivity and stability.
