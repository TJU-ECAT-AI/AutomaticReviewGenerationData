The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite demonstrates excellent activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions, surpassing many metal-based catalysts. B2O3, with its melting point of 450°C, plays a crucial role in hydrocarbon conversions. However, its melting at high temperatures poses a significant challenge for B2O3-containing catalysts.
