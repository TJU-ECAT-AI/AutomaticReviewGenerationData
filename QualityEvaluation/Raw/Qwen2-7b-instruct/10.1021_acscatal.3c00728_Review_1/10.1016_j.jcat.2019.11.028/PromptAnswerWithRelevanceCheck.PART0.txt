[1] "In the initial stage, BPO4 particles are produced in molten B2O3 at 800 C, exceeding the melting point of B2O3 (450 C)."
[2] "In the attachment process, the individual BPO4 particles directly merge with their neighboring crystallites to form agglomerations."
[3] "Then some agglomerated particles are induced to generate BPO4 solid spheres through self-assembly."
[4] "Once the solid spheres form, an Ostwald ripening process occurs (i.e., the smaller crystallites in the central parts are dissolved and redeposited on the larger crystallites at outer parts), resulting in the formation of BPO4 hollow sphere structures."
[5] "During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."
