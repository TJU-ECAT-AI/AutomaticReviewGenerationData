The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b), play a crucial role in influencing the performance of these catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites are responsible for the activity of the catalyst in ODHP, leading to high propylene selectivity. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites helps in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The study reveals that the activity of the catalyst is closely correlated with the presence of these defective trigonal boron structures, which can transform from tetrahedral to trigonal form under specific conditions, enhancing the catalytic efficiency in ODHP reactions.

2.1. "Recently, several catalysts based on defective hexagonal boron nitride for the ODH of light alkanes have been reported. This new family of catalysts shows superior selectivity to olefins and low CO2 formation."
2.2. "Inspired by the previous studies, besides boron nitride, thermally stable silicon boride has also been proved as the active catalyst for ODH."
2.3. "Zeolites are one of the most common catalyst supports, and widely used in industry due to its large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimension, and high thermal stabilities."
2.4. "The actual boron content of the zeolites before and after various treatments was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on Optima2000DV."
2.5. "The XRD patterns showed four main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7.21, 8.02, 10.10 and 26.33, corresponding to the known (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (3 1 0) reflections of ERB-1, which confirmed the MWW structure."
2.6. "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape (Fig. 2 b), featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."
2.7. "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively."
2.8. "The major products of propane ODH consist of C3H6, C2H4, and CO, with very small amount of CO2 (<1%)."
2.9. "The selectivity towards the desired product, propylene, decreases slightly with elevated temperatures."
2.10. "For example, as the temperature was increased from 500 to 530 C, the propane conversion increased from 3.9% to 15.6%."
2.11. "The XRD patterns of the used catalysts still retained the typical MWW structure under the ODH conditions for 20 h."
2.12. "Making further efforts to obtain best fit, the one-dimensional 11B MAS NMR spectra of these catalysts acquired at magnetic fields of 11.7T and 14.1T were deconvoluted by the same parameters (δiso, CQ and ηQ) guided by the sliced spectra from 11B MQ MAS NMR, and the parameters were listed in Table S2."
2.13. "The peaks at 18, 15, 11, 0 and 2.8 ppm were ascribed to tri-coordinated boron which denoted as B[3]a, B[3]b and B[3]c respectively."
2.14. "Considering the fact that propane conversion increased from 19.9% to 29.8% during reaction period of 1 to 20 h, it can be inferred that the amount of B[3]a and B[3]b species (defective trigonal boron species) may be correlated with the catalytic activity of the catalyst in propane ODH reaction."
2.15. "The TOF value of BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 were 4.3, 4.3 and 3.8 h1, respectively, indicated the intrinsic catalytic activities for the BZEO catalysts are identical under same reaction conditions."
2.16. "We can then deduce that the transformation from B[4]a+b to B[3]a+b can be ignored during the constant reaction process. Thus, we postulate that B[3]a and B[3]b are responsible for the ODH activity."
2.17. "This well-defined catalyst system provided a platform for further investigation of the relationship between boron coordination environment and ODH performance."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites exhibit unique properties and reaction mechanisms that contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) is found to correlate with the activity for propane ODH. The study demonstrates that B-based zeolite catalysts can achieve high propylene selectivity and total light olefins selectivity, which is promising for industrial application. The structural characterization reveals that the MWW-type zeolite, with its large internal surface areas, micropores, and high thermal stabilities, is suitable for ODHP reactions. The use of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) allows for precise measurement of boron content before and after various treatments. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the MWW structure of the zeolite catalysts. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms indicate the presence of predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores. The band assignments to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron provide insights into the coordination environment of boron species. The major products of ODHP consist of C3H6, C2H4, and CO, with a negligible amount of CO2. The selectivity towards propylene decreases slightly with elevated temperatures, yet the total selectivity for light olefins remains almost unchanged up to 530°C. The propane conversion increases from 3.9% to 15.6% as the temperature rises from 500 to 530°C. The XRD patterns retain the typical MWW structure even after 20 hours of reaction under ODHP conditions. The one-dimensional 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy helps in identifying the active boron species, such as B[3]a, B[3]b, and B[3]c. The correlation between the amount of B[3]a and B[3]b species and propane conversion suggests that these defective trigonal boron structures are responsible for the ODHP activity. The intrinsic catalytic activities of the BZEO catalysts are found to be identical under the same reaction conditions, and the transformation from B[4]a+b to B[3]a+b can be ignored during the constant reaction process. The study provides a platform for further investigation of the relationship between boron coordination environment and ODH performance, contributing to the development of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications.

在B基催化剂中，尤其是1-D边活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能产生了显著影响。这些位点表现出独特的性质和反应机制，为设计更高效的商用催化剂提供了贡献。缺陷三阶硼物种（B[3]a和B[3]b）的数量与丙烷ODHP活性相关。研究表明，基于B的沸石催化剂能够实现高丙烯选择性和总轻烯烃选择性，这为工业应用提供了前景。结构表征显示，MWW型沸石催化剂具有大的内部表面积、微孔尺寸和高热稳定性，适合ODHP反应。使用电感耦合等离子体光发射光谱法（ICP-OES）可以精确测量催化剂在各种处理前后的硼含量。X射线衍射（XRD）图案证实了沸石催化剂的MWW结构。氮吸附-脱附等温线表明存在主要微孔和少量间隙介孔。将三阶和四阶硼的带分配给三阶和四阶硼提供了关于硼物种协调环境的见解。ODHP的主要产物包括C3H6、C2H4和CO，CO2的量非常少。随着温度的升高，从500°C到530°C，丙烷转化率从3.9%增加到15.6%。在20小时的反应条件下，XRD模式仍然保留了典型的MWW结构。一维11B MAS核磁共振光谱有助于识别活性硼物种，如B[3]a、B[3]b和B[3]c。B[3]a和B[3]b物种的数量与丙烷转化率之间的相关性表明，这些缺陷三阶硼结构是ODHP活性的原因。BZEO催化剂的内在催化活性在相同的反应条件下被发现是相同的，并且B[4]a+b向B[3]a+b的转变在恒定反应过程中可以忽略不计。该研究提供了一个平台，用于进一步探讨硼配位环境与ODHP性能的关系，从而推动了高效催化剂的发展以满足工业应用的需求。
