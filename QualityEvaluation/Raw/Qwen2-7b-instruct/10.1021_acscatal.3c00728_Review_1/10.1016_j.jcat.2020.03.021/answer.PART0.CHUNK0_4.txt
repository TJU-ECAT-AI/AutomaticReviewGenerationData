1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly those with 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these sites' unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

2. Zeolites, with their large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimensions, and high thermal stability, are commonly used as catalyst supports in industrial processes, including the ODHP reactions.

3. At a reaction temperature of 530°C, the total selectivity to light olefins (propylene and ethylene) reached 91.6%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the catalysts in this specific application.

4. The active sites responsible for the ODHP activity are attributed to the abundance of defective trigonal boron structures within the catalyst material. These structures are found to correlate with the catalyst's activity in propane ODH reactions.

5. The well-defined catalyst system enables researchers to explore the intricate relationship between the boron coordination environment and the overall performance of the catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. This understanding is vital for optimizing catalyst design and enhancing their efficiency in commercial applications.
