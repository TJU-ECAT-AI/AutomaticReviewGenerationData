<p>Recently, several catalysts based on defective hexagonal boron nitride for the ODH of light alkanes have been reported. This new family of catalysts shows superior selectivity to olefins and low CO2 formation.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, an MWW borosilicate zeolite) was an active and selective catalyst for ODH of propane, showing a propylene selectivity of 80.4% at a propane conversion of 15.6%. Noticeably, the total selectivity to light olefins can reach 91.6% at 530 C.</p>
<p>The catalytic active sites were attributed to the abundant of defective trigonal boron structures.</p>
<p>The results turned out that higher conversion was obtained at higher boron content under identical reaction condition.</p>
<p>The apparent activation energies of propane over BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 catalysts were of 212, 204 and 205 kJ/mol, respectively (Fig. 3 c).</p>
<p>The one-dimensional 11B MAS NMR spectra showed broad and overlapped signals due to quadrupolar interaction.</p>
<p>These overlapped signals can be effectively discriminated along the F1 dimension using two-dimensional 11B MQ MAS NMR.</p>
<p>At least five types of major B species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a and B[4]b) present in the catalysts.</p>
<p>After 20 h reaction, there was no significant change of B[3]c species, while the presence of B[3]a was increased at the cost of B[3]b species.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that propane conversion increased from 19.9% to 29.8% during reaction period of 1 to 20 h, it can be inferred that the amount of B[3]a and B[3]b species (defective trigonal boron species) may be correlated with the catalytic activity of the catalyst in propane ODH reaction.</p>
<p>To elucidate the origin of active sites, we calculated the TOF of BZEO catalysts at 500 C based on the fraction of B[3]a and B[3]b (Fig. S6 , Table S3).</p>
<p>We postulate that B[3]a and B[3]b are responsible for the ODH activity. The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites.</p>

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The study demonstrated that an MWW-type zeolite containing abundant defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was highly effective in ODHP reactions. These sites showed superior selectivity towards olefin products and low CO2 formation. The active sites were identified through structural characterization, which revealed that the conversion and selectivity of the catalyst were closely related to the amount of these defective trigonal boron structures. This insight into the active site properties and their role in ODHP reactions paves the way for the development of optimized catalysts with enhanced efficiency and selectivity for commercial use.
