1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

2. The ODHP performance of B-based catalysts is closely tied to the presence of oxygen-containing boron species at their surfaces. These species are essential for achieving superior catalytic performance.

3. Zeolites are a common catalyst support due to their large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimensions, and high thermal stability, making them suitable for various industrial applications.

4. At 530°C, the total selectivity to light olefins in the ODHP reaction reaches 91.6%. This highlights the efficiency of the catalysts in producing desired products under high-temperature conditions.

5. Defective trigonal boron structures are identified as the active sites responsible for the ODHP activity in the MWW-type zeolite catalysts.

6. The correlation between the amount of defective trigonal boron species and the propane conversion indicates that these specific boron structures are crucial for the catalyst's performance in the ODHP reaction.
