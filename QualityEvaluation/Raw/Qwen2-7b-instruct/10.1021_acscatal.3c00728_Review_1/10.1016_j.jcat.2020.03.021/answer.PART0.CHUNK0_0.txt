<p>The major advantages of ODH are the absence of equilibrium limitations on propane conversion and the suppression of catalyst coking.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the total selectivity to light olefins can reach 91.6% at 530 C.</p>
<p>The abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH.</p>
<p>At a propane conversion of 15.6%, the catalyst exhibited a propylene selectivity of 80.4% and the total light olefins selectivity of 91.6% at 530 C.</p>
<p>The tetrahedral boron can be transformed to trigonal structure with carefully dehydration treatment.</p>
<p>This well-defined catalyst system provided a platform for further investigation of the relationship between boron coordination environment and ODH performance.</p>

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b), play a crucial role in influencing the performance of these catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites are responsible for the activity of the catalyst in ODHP, leading to high propylene selectivity. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites helps in designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The study reveals that the activity of the catalyst is closely correlated with the presence of these defective trigonal boron structures, which can transform from tetrahedral to trigonal form under specific conditions, enhancing the catalytic efficiency in ODHP reactions.
