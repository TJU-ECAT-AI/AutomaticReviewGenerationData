[1] "Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2."
[2] "The antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane."
[3] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2."
[4] "In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."
[5] "In this work, the results in Fig. 3 showed that the BO groups took part in the reaction network. However, the BO groups themselves have no catalytic activity for CH cleavage."
[6] "Extensive studies have showed that the BOH groups easily generates from BO species in the presence of steam."
[7] "The kinetic analysis exhibited that the reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5."
[8] "The values of Ea were obvious higher than those reported for metal oxide catalysts."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable the selective breaking of CH bonds without over-oxidation, producing valuable olefins such as propylene. The unique properties of these 1-D edge sites, including their ability to facilitate the selective cleavage of CH bonds and inhibit over-oxidation pathways, contribute significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Understanding these reaction mechanisms allows for the optimization of catalyst design, leading to improved selectivity, productivity, and stability in the ODHP process.
