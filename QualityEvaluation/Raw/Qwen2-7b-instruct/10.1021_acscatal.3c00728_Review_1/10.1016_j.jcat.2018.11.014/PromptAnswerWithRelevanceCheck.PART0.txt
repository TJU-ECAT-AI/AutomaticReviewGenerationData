<p>It must be pointed out that the B2O3 signal cannot be detected at 535C for the low melting point of B2O3.</p>
<p>In contrast, the bulk phase structure of silicon boride remained unchanged in the oxygen atmosphere at any stages except for slight peak shifts due to a change in lattice parameters resulted from the thermal expansion, implying that the oxyfunctionalization of catalyst was facilitated under ODH reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, a higher binding energy of the B 1s signal located at 193.8eV was detected for SiB-1h and SiB-3h catalysts, which was assigned to the boron oxide (B2O3).</p>
<p>However, as the catalytic activity increasing during the activation process, the concentrations of boron decreased to 31.8% after 1h and 30.2% after 3h, estimated from the B 1s XPS spectrum, suggesting that the catalytic activity was not direct related to boron concentration on the surfaces of the silicon boride.</p>
<p>In addition, the presence of alkane may promote molecular oxygen dissociation then produce oxygen radicals.</p>

<p>Huang et al. [18] reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane.</p>

Due to the free coking and no equilibrium limitation in alkanes conversion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins offers an attractive route, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of CO2.
The antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst.
The catalyst h-BN can convert propane to propylene with a selectivity reaching 80%, more than 90% for both propylene and ethylene, with negligible CO2 formation (0.5%) at a given propane conversion of 20.6%.
People in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable element for high ODH activity.
Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes.
Before using, the silicon boride was activated by feed gas (C3H8/O2/N2) at 535C for 3h.
The activity of silicon boride catalyst in ODH of light alkanes including ethane, propane and isobutane was showed in Fig. 1.
In the B 1s XPS spectrum of the fresh catalyst, the percentages of BSi bond (187.0eV) and BO bond (189.8eV) were 49.4% and 46.6%, while the suboxide (BxOy, y/x<1.5, 192.6eV) species [29] contributed the rest 4.0%.
Upon exposure to the ODH of propane reaction (535C), the surface oxygen concentrations increased to 50.4% after 1h (SiB-1h) and 54.8% after 3h (SiB-3h).
In contrast, the percentages of BO species (BxOy and B2O3) in B 1s XPS spectrum increased to 46.8% after 1h and 79.7% after 3h.
The results in Fig. 3 showed that the BO groups took part in the reaction network.
As shown in Eq.
(1) , a near second-order dependence of propane concentration suggested that the activation of propane determined the total reaction rate.
