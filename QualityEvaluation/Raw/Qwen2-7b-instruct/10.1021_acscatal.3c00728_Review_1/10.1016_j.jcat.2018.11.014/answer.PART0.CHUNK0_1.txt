The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Silicon boride, with its antioxidant ability, ensures catalytic stability. The BOH groups generated from BO species with assistance from steam are identified as potential catalytic activity sites, contributing to the high selectivity in the dehydrogenation process.
