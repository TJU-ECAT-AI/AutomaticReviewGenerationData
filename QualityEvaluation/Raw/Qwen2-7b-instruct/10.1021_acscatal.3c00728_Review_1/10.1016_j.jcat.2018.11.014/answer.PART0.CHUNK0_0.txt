2.1. "The recent discovery that antioxidant and chemically inert hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is extremely active for ODH process of ethane and propane opens up a new research direction in selective cleavage of CH bond of alkanes by the metal-free catalyst."
2.2. "It consequently expands the fundamental understanding of the industrially important ODH process."
2.3. "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2."
2.4. "In the following up study, Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."
2.5. "Recently [18] , we showed that boron nitride can also oxidize methane to valuable products."
2.6. "Moreover, Xie and coworkers demonstrated that carbon-doped BN catalyst showed good activity in ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene [20] ."
2.7. "Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable element for high ODH activity."
2.8. "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."
2.9. "Study on the metal-free silicon boride may make a better understanding on the catalytic origin of the boron species, and further initiate the exploration of other new boron-based catalysts."
2.10. "The functionalised silicon boride showed high ODH activity for light alkanes; more importantly, the antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."
2.11. "Based on spectra and dynamics analysis, the BOH groups generated from the BO species with the assistance of steam might be catalytic activity sites."
2.12. "This work experimentally supports that the catalytic origin of the boron species from the metal-free catalyst initiate the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influences their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable selective cleavage of CH bonds, reducing over-oxidation and CO2 formation. The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, such as the BOH groups generated from the BO species with assistance of steam, contribute to the high selectivity and stability of these catalysts. By elucidating the reaction mechanisms and properties of these active sites, researchers can design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, optimizing the conversion and selectivity of alkanes to olefins.
