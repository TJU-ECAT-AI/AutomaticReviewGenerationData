<p>It must be pointed out that the B2O3 signal cannot be detected at 535C for the low melting point of B2O3.</p>
<p>In contrast, the bulk phase structure of silicon boride remained unchanged in the oxygen atmosphere at any stages except for slight peak shifts due to a change in lattice parameters resulted from the thermal expansion, implying that the oxyfunctionalization of catalyst was facilitated under ODH reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, a higher binding energy of the B 1s signal located at 193.8eV was detected for SiB-1h and SiB-3h catalysts, which was assigned to the boron oxide (B2O3).</p>
<p>However, as the catalytic activity increasing during the activation process, the concentrations of boron decreased to 31.8% after 1h and 30.2% after 3h, estimated from the B 1s XPS spectrum, suggesting that the catalytic activity was not direct related to boron concentration on the surfaces of the silicon boride.</p>
<p>In addition, the presence of alkane may promote molecular oxygen dissociation then produce oxygen radicals.</p>
<p>Under the C3H8 atmosphere, the strong alkyl stretching signal at 2965cm1 is attributable to the presence of propane gas.</p>
<p>As the reaction proceeding, the DRIFT difference spectra of the catalyst and the corresponding MS signal of propylene were recorded under aerobic or anaerobic conditions by switching the feed gas from N2 to C3H8 and then to C3H8/O2, respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, when catalyst was just exposed to O2 atmosphere, the position of the absorption band of silicon boride catalyst remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Huang et al. [18] reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane.</p>
<p>Grant et al. [16] found that the high selectivity of propylene in the ODH of propane was related to the formation of BOx active site at the surfaces of h-BN and boron-containing catalysts.</p>
<p>In this work, the results in Fig. 3 showed that the BO groups took part in the reaction network.</p>
<p>However, the BO groups themselves have no catalytic activity for CH cleavage [17].</p>
<p>Extensive studies have showed that the BOH groups easily generates from BO species in the presence of steam [33],[34].</p>
<p>This result suggested that the H/D atoms in the SiB-D catalyst were abstracted during the reaction process, and also implied that the BOH(D) groups of silicon boride catalyst might incorporate into the ODH reaction.</p>
<p>The kinetic analysis exhibited that the reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5.</p>
<p>The apparent activation energy (Ea) were estimated to be 268kJmol−1, 244kJmol−1 and 160kJmol−1 for ethane, propane and isobutane, respectively.</p>

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, such as the 1-D edge active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These unique properties allow for optimized interaction with reactants, facilitating the breaking of C-H bonds and the formation of olefin products. Understanding the specific reaction mechanisms of these active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The kinetic analysis reveals that the reaction order of oxygen is approximately 0.5, indicating that molecular oxygen plays a crucial role in the ODHP process. The apparent activation energies for ethane, propane, and isobutane are 268 kJ/mol, 244 kJ/mol, and 160 kJ/mol, respectively, highlighting the importance of CH bond cleavage during the ODHP process using B-based catalysts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，如六方氮化硼（h-BN）中的1-D边缘活性位点，在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能有显著影响。这些独特的性质允许优化与反应物的相互作用，促进C-H键的断裂和烯烃产物的形成。理解这些活性位点的具体反应机制有助于设计更高效的商用催化剂。动力学分析表明氧气的反应级数约为0.5，说明分子氧在ODHP过程中起关键作用。乙烯、丙烷和异丁烷的表观活化能分别为268 kJ/mol、244 kJ/mol和160 kJ/mol，这强调了使用B基催化剂时CH键断裂在ODHP过程中的重要性。
