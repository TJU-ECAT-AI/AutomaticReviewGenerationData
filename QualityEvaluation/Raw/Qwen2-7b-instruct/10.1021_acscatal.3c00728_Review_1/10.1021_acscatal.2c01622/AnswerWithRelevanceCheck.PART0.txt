          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the dynamic self-dispersion of aggregated boron clusters into stable oligomeric boron species on MFI zeolite nanosheets under ODHP allows for the investigation of how different site configurations affect catalytic efficiency. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts suitable for commercial applications.
