[1] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C."
[2] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[3] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[4] "As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."
[5] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites are characterized by their ability to selectively activate the CH bond in propane, thereby promoting the desired dehydrogenation to propylene while simultaneously suppressing unwanted overoxidation to CO2. The high selectivity and remarkable stability observed in edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalysts demonstrate the effectiveness of these 1-D edge active sites. The detailed structural characterization reveals that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively trigger propane dehydrogenation by breaking the CH bond, which contributes to the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in the selective activation of alkane bonds.

在B基催化剂中，尤其是关注于1-D边活性位点的空间分布和维度，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能产生了显著影响。这些位点能够选择性地激活丙烷中的CH键，从而促进所需的脱氢生成丙烯，同时同时抑制丙烯过氧化为CO2的不希望的反应。边羟基化硼氮化物（BNOH）催化剂中观察到的高选择性和出色的稳定性证明了这些1-D边活性位点的有效性。详细的结构表征显示，硼氮化物的边上的BOH组分能够选择性地触发丙烷脱氢，通过断开CH键来促进这一过程，这有助于开发用于选择性激活烷基键的更高效催化剂，以供商业应用。
