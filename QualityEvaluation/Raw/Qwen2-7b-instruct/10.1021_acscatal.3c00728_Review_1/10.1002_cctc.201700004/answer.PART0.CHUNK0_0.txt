[1] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[2] "The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggered propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2."
[3] "In particular, the selectivity was 80.2% for propylene and only 0.5% for CO2."
[4] "Moreover, the selectivity toward propylene can be further promoted by mediating the reaction conditions."
[5] "The FTIR analysis was performed to identify the roles of the BOB and BOH groups under the reaction conditions."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in the performance of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable the selective breaking of the CH bond in propane, thereby promoting the production of propylene with minimal CO2 formation. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites, including their dynamic generation through hydrogen abstraction by molecular oxygen, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. This understanding allows for the optimization of reaction conditions, enhancing propylene selectivity and reducing CO2 emissions, ultimately leading to improved catalyst stability and performance over prolonged periods.
