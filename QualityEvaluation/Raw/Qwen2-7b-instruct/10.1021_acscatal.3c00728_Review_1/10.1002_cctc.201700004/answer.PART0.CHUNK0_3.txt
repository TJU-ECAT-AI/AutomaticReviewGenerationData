[1] "Recent, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[2] "Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed."
[3] "As reported herein our group found that boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at the edges, can efficiently catalyze the ODH of propane."
[4] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[5] "At a 6.5% conversion level of propane, it offers a surprising propylene selectivity as high as 97.4%."
[6] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[7] "Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins (ethylene+propylene, C23=) was up to 90.9%, which was much higher than the selectivities obtained over the well-developed metal or metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level."
[8] "Moreover, the selectivity toward propylene can be further promoted by mediating the reaction conditions."
[9] "The FTIR analysis was performed to identify the roles of the BOH and BOB groups under the reaction conditions."
[10] "The characteristic band of hydroxyl stretching vibration was clearly observed at approximately 3400cm−1."
[11] "Upon exposure to C3H8 atmosphere at 530C, the band position of the hydroxyl stretches remained unchanged, and no propane conversion was detected."
[12] "With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C3H8/He), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened."
[13] "The intensities of hydroxyl vibrational stretches were fully recovered upon steam activation."
[14] "The hydroxyl groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction network."
[15] "The hydroxyl vibrational stretches were fully recovered upon steam activation."

Answer: The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically focusing on 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable the selective activation of the CH bond in propane, allowing for efficient propane dehydrogenation while minimizing the formation of unwanted CO2. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalysts demonstrate high selectivity towards propylene, achieving up to 80.2% selectivity at a 20.6% propane conversion, with only 0.5% CO2 formation. The remarkable stability of the catalyst ensures consistent performance over a 300-hour operation period at 530°C. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites, particularly the ability of hydroxyl groups to interact with molecular oxygen and incorporate into the reaction network, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. This understanding allows for the optimization of reaction conditions to further promote propylene selectivity, as seen with a 97.4% selectivity at a 6.5% propane conversion level. The catalyst's ability to regenerate hydroxyl groups upon steam activation also highlights its dynamic nature and adaptability in the ODH process.

Answer: 在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是关注于1-D边缘活性位点，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有重要影响。这些位点使CH键在丙烷中的选择性激活成为可能，从而实现高效的丙烷脱氢，同时最大限度地减少CO2的形成。经过蒸汽羟基化的硼氮化物催化剂显示出高达80.2%的丙烯选择性，在20.6%的丙烷转化率下，仅产生0.5%的CO2。催化剂的出色稳定性确保其在530°C的连续运行300小时期间保持一致性能。理解这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，尤其是羟基团与分子氧相互作用并融入反应网络的能力，对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂至关重要。这种理解允许优化反应条件，进一步提高丙烯选择性，例如在6.5%的丙烷转化率水平上达到97.4%的选择性。催化剂能够通过蒸汽活化再生羟基团的特点也凸显了其动态特性和在ODHP过程中的适应性。
