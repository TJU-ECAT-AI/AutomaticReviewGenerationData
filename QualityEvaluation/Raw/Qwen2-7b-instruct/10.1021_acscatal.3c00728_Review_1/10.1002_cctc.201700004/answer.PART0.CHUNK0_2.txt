[1] "The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggered propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2."
[2] "The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C."
[3] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred."
[4] "The edge possesses a higher π* to σ* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge."
[5] "The cleavage of CH bonds readily happens after oxygen activation in the BNOH catalytic system for the ODH of propane."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These unique sites enable selective activation of the CH bond in propane, facilitating dehydrogenation while simultaneously inhibiting overoxidation pathways to CO2. The BNOH catalyst, after steam hydroxylation at its edges, demonstrates high selectivity towards propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%). The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst, evidenced by a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity, further highlights the potential of these 1-D edge active sites for industrial applications. Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial use.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，尤其是1-D边活性位点，在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能至关重要。这些独特的位点能够选择性地激活丙烷中的CH键，促进脱氢同时抑制向CO2的过氧化路径。经过蒸汽活化的BNOH催化剂在其边缘展现出对丙烯（高达80.2%）的高选择性，尤其是在更高丙烷转化率（20.6%）下的情况下。BNOH催化剂的显著稳定性，通过在530°C下进行长达300小时的测试，并保持转化率和产物选择性的稳定，进一步突显了这些1-D边活性位点在工业应用中的潜力。理解这些1-D边活性位点的特性和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂以用于商业用途。
