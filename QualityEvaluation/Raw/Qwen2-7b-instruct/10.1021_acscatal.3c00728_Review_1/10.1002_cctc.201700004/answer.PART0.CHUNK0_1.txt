The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically focusing on 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in enhancing their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites are dynamically generated through the hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, allowing for selective cleavage of the CH bond in propane while simultaneously preventing the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Notably, at a 6.5% conversion level of propane, the BNOH catalyst demonstrates a surprising propylene selectivity of 97.4%. Furthermore, the BNOH catalyst exhibits remarkable stability in the ODH of propane, as evidenced by a 300-hour test at 530°C, where no significant variations in conversion and product selectivity were observed. This stability and the ability to selectively break the CH bond without overoxidation make the BNOH catalyst an attractive option for industrial applications. Additionally, the FTIR analysis confirms the role of the BOH and BOB groups in the reaction process, providing insights into the dynamic nature of the active sites. Lastly, the activation energy measurements reveal that the cleavage of CH bonds readily occurs after oxygen activation in the BNOH catalytic system, highlighting the efficiency of the BNOH catalyst in ODHP reactions.

活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是针对1-D边活性位点，在促进B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。这些位点通过分子氧对BOH基团的氢抽象动态生成，允许选择性地断裂丙烷中的CH键，同时同时阻止丙烯过氧化为CO2。理解这些1-D边活性位点的独特性质和反应机制对于设计更适合工业应用的催化剂至关重要。值得注意的是，在6.5%的丙烷转化率下，BNOH催化剂显示出高达97.4%的丙烯选择性。此外，BNOH催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中表现出惊人的稳定性，在530°C下的300小时测试中，未观察到转化率和产品选择性有显著变化。这种稳定性和在不进行过氧化的情况下选择性断裂CH键的能力使BNOH催化剂成为工业应用的吸引人选择。此外，傅里叶变换红外光谱分析证实了BOH和BOB基团在反应过程中的作用，提供了关于活性位点动态性的见解。最后，激活能测量显示，在BNOH催化系统中，CH键的断裂在氧气激活后迅速发生，突出了BNOH催化剂在ODHP反应中的效率。
