[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "In addition, exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The addition of Ni to a 10wt% CrOx catalyst supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) enhances the stability of the catalyst during the ODHP reaction. The Ni addition facilitates the easy regeneration of reduced CrOx, maintains the active Cr3+ state, and improves the selectivity for propylene. Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic stability and efficiency in the ODHP reaction.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能有显著影响。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商用催化剂。向10wt% CrOx支持在SBA-15上的催化剂（Cr/Si）中添加Ni，可以增强催化剂在ODHP反应中的稳定性。Ni的添加能够促进还原的CrOx的再生，维持活性的Cr3+状态，并提高丙烯的选择性。因此，Ni改性的Cr/Si催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出增强的催化稳定性和效率。
