The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The addition of Ni to a 10wt% CrOx catalyst supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) enhances the stability of the catalyst during the ODHP reaction. The Ni addition facilitates the easy regeneration of reduced CrOx, maintains the active Cr3+ state, and improves the selectivity for propylene. Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic stability and efficiency in the ODHP reaction.

The introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter into a chromium oxide catalyst supported on silica (Cr/Si) significantly improves the catalyst's performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the Cr/Si catalyst results in enhanced stability and selectivity, leading to a higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene. The key mechanism involves Ni promoting the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced chromium oxide (CrOx) back to its active state. This process enables the catalyst to maintain the active phase of its chromium (Cr) species, specifically the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states, thus enhancing the stability and efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

将镍（Ni）作为促进剂引入到硅基载铬氧化物催化剂（Cr/Si）中显著提高了该催化剂在丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。向Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni后，催化剂表现出增强的稳定性和选择性，实现了更高的CO2转化率和稳定的丙烯产量。关键机制在于Ni促进了CO2的分解为CO和活性氧（O*ads），进而再生还原的铬氧化物（CrOx）回到其活性状态。这一过程使得催化剂能够保持其铬（Cr）物种的活性相位，特别是协调不饱和Cr3+状态，从而增强了ODHP反应的稳定性和效率。

[3] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[4] "In the case of 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalysts, no peak assigned to NiO was observed because the amount of NiO was too small to be detectable or was highly dispersed on the Cr/Si catalyst."

The introduction of Ni as a promoter into a 10wt% CrOx catalyst supported on SBA-15 significantly improves the catalyst's stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the catalyst maintains the activity and selectivity of the catalyst over time. This is due to the easy regeneration of reduced CrOx by Ni, which facilitates the dissociation of CO2 to CO and the generation of activated oxygen (O*ads). This oxygen is then transferred to reoxidize the reduced CrOx, maintaining the active Cr3+ states essential for the ODHP reaction. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst thus shows enhanced stability in producing propylene compared to the non-promoted catalyst.

向10wt% CrOx催化剂上添加Ni作为促进剂显著提高了丙烷与CO2在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化剂稳定性和选择性。向催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni可保持催化剂的活性和选择性。这是由于Ni可以轻松地再生还原的CrOx，这有助于将CO2分解为CO和生成激活氧（O*ads）。然后，此氧气被转移到还原的CrOx上进行再氧化，维持ODHP反应所需的活性Cr3+状态。因此，Ni促进的Cr/Si催化剂在生产丙烯时表现出增强的稳定性。
