The introduction of nickel (Ni) as a promoter into a chromium oxide catalyst supported on silica (Cr/Si) significantly improves the catalyst's performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the Cr/Si catalyst results in enhanced stability and selectivity, leading to a higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene. The key mechanism involves Ni promoting the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced chromium oxide (CrOx) back to its active state. This process enables the catalyst to maintain the active phase of its chromium (Cr) species, specifically the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states, thus enhancing the stability and efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

将镍（Ni）作为促进剂引入到硅基载铬氧化物催化剂（Cr/Si）中显著提高了该催化剂在丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。向Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni后，催化剂表现出增强的稳定性和选择性，实现了更高的CO2转化率和稳定的丙烯产量。关键机制在于Ni促进了CO2的分解为CO和活性氧（O*ads），进而再生还原的铬氧化物（CrOx）回到其活性状态。这一过程使得催化剂能够保持其铬（Cr）物种的活性相位，特别是协调不饱和Cr3+状态，从而增强了ODHP反应的稳定性和效率。
