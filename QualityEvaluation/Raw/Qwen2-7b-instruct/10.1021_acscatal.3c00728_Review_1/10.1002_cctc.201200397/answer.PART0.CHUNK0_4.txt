[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "Exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[5] "Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[6] "Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The introduction of Ni as a promoter into a 10wt% CrOx catalyst supported on SBA-15 significantly improves the catalyst's stability and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the catalyst maintains the activity and selectivity of the catalyst over time. This is due to the easy regeneration of reduced CrOx by Ni, which facilitates the dissociation of CO2 to CO and the generation of activated oxygen (O*ads). This oxygen is then transferred to reoxidize the reduced CrOx, maintaining the active Cr3+ states essential for the ODHP reaction. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst thus shows enhanced stability in producing propylene compared to the non-promoted catalyst.

向10wt% CrOx催化剂上添加Ni作为促进剂显著提高了丙烷与CO2在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化剂稳定性和选择性。向催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni可保持催化剂的活性和选择性。这是由于Ni可以轻松地再生还原的CrOx，这有助于将CO2分解为CO和生成激活氧（O*ads）。然后，此氧气被转移到还原的CrOx上进行再氧化，维持ODHP反应所需的活性Cr3+状态。因此，Ni促进的Cr/Si催化剂在生产丙烯时表现出增强的稳定性。
