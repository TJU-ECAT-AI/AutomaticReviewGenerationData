[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "In the case of the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst, the intensity of the first TPR peak decreases and new peaks centered at approximately 200 and 500C appear."
[4] "Interestingly, for the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."
[5] "The role of Ni as a promoter of the reaction was investigated in detail by exsitu XPS measurements."
