[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
[2] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[3] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[4] "In the case of 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalysts, no peak assigned to NiO was observed because the amount of NiO was too small to be detectable or was highly dispersed on the Cr/Si catalyst."
[5] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[6] "The Ni-promoted catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[7] "CO2 is a more effective oxidant and reduced Cr2+ states are regenerated to active Cr3+ states."
[8] "In the second TPR peak, the catalysts were reduced entirely in the first TPR peak. In the third TPR peak, a large portion of the first TPR peak was recovered after the CO2 treatment."
[9] "For the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions by affecting their reactivity, selectivity, and stability. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The addition of Ni as a promoter to a CrOx catalyst supported on silica significantly improves the stability and selectivity of the catalyst. The Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), which helps regenerate the reduced Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states. This process enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction, as demonstrated by the three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis. The regeneration of active sites through the activation of CO2 by Ni is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and longevity of the catalyst in commercial applications.

在B基催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度影响其在丙烯氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能，这影响其反应性、选择性和稳定性。理解这些位点的独特特性和反应机制，尤其是1-D边缘活性位点，对于设计更高效的商用催化剂至关重要。将Ni作为促进剂添加到CrOx催化剂上支持的硅酸盐中，显著提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。Ni促进了CO2的分解为CO和激活O（O*ads），有助于将还原的Cr2+状态再生为活性Cr3+状态。这一过程通过三步H2-温度程序化还原分析增强了丙烯在ODHP反应中的催化稳定性。Ni通过激活CO2促进活性位点的再生是维持催化剂效率和使用寿命的关键。
