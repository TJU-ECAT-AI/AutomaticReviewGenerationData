[1] "Boronic acid derivatives, especially those with an electron-withdrawing group, have shown remarkable catalytic activity for the regioselective hydrogenolysis of alkyl halides."
[2] "In the presence of hydrogen, these derivatives act as Lewis acids, facilitating the proton transfer and subsequent elimination of the halide ion."
[3] "The regioselectivity of the hydrogenolysis is often attributed to the steric hindrance and electronic effects of the substituents on the boronic acid."
[4] "This mechanism is particularly useful for the synthesis of chiral alcohols from alkyl halides and boronic acids in the presence of a chiral catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The regioselective hydrogenolysis of alkyl halides using boronic acid derivatives is facilitated by the derivatives acting as Lewis acids, which enables proton transfer and the elimination of the halide ion. The regioselectivity is influenced by the steric hindrance and electronic effects of the substituents on the boronic acid. This process is advantageous for synthesizing chiral alcohols from alkyl halides and boronic acids with the aid of a chiral catalyst.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for enhancing their performance. In the context of the document, the hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, emitting minimal CO2. The catalyst's active sites are dynamically generated through the hydrogen abstraction of B-OH groups by molecular oxygen. This mechanism is key to ethane dehydrogenation, especially since catalysts with exceptional high-temperature oxidation resistance are essential for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, which typically occurs at higher temperatures. This catalyst system offers valuable insights into alkane catalytic activation and presents a promising option for industrial oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
