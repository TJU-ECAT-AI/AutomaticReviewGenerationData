[1] "Hydroxylated boron nitride, a metal free catalyst, shows superior selectivity and excellent stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with only negligible CO2 emission."
[2] "Both experimental and computational studies have identified that the hydrogen abstraction of B-OH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generated the active sites and triggered ethane dehydrogenation."
[3] "As the ODH of ethane typically operates at higher temperatures than that of propane, catalysts with outstanding high-temperature oxidation resistance become the crucial issue."
[4] "This novel metal-free catalyst system enriches our knowledge on catalytic activation of alkanes and serves as a promising catalyst for the industrial ODH process."

Understanding the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is crucial for enhancing their performance. In the context of the document, the hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, emitting minimal CO2. The catalyst's active sites are dynamically generated through the hydrogen abstraction of B-OH groups by molecular oxygen. This mechanism is key to ethane dehydrogenation, especially since catalysts with exceptional high-temperature oxidation resistance are essential for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, which typically occurs at higher temperatures. This catalyst system offers valuable insights into alkane catalytic activation and presents a promising option for industrial oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

对于B基催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的空间分布和维度，理解其对性能的影响至关重要。根据文档，在氧化乙烯的文献中，羟基化的硼氮化物催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢过程中表现出高选择性和稳定性，仅产生微量二氧化碳。该催化剂的活性位点通过分子氧对B-OH基团的氢抽象动态生成。这一机制是乙烷脱氢的关键，尤其是在丙烷氧化脱氢中，由于其通常在比乙烷更高的温度下进行，因此催化剂具有出色的高温氧化稳定性成为关键因素。这种催化剂系统为烷烃催化激活提供了宝贵的知识，并为工业氧化脱氢过程提供了一个有前景的选择。
