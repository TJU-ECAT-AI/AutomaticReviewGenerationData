[1] "Boronic acid derivatives, especially those with an electron-withdrawing group, have shown remarkable catalytic activity for the regioselective hydrogenolysis of alkyl halides."
[2] "In the presence of hydrogen, these derivatives act as Lewis acids, facilitating the proton transfer and subsequent elimination of the halide ion."
[3] "The regioselectivity of the hydrogenolysis is often attributed to the steric hindrance and electronic effects of the substituents on the boronic acid."
[4] "This mechanism is particularly useful for the synthesis of chiral alcohols from alkyl halides and boronic acids in the presence of a chiral catalyst."

The regioselective hydrogenolysis of alkyl halides using boronic acid derivatives is facilitated by the derivatives acting as Lewis acids, which enables proton transfer and the elimination of the halide ion. The regioselectivity is influenced by the steric hindrance and electronic effects of the substituents on the boronic acid. This process is advantageous for synthesizing chiral alcohols from alkyl halides and boronic acids with the aid of a chiral catalyst.

硼酸衍生物，尤其是带有吸电子基团的衍生物，在氢的存在下作为路易斯酸，促进质子转移并随后消除卤素离子，从而实现烷基卤化物的区域选择性氢解。这种区域选择性通常归因于硼酸上取代基的空间阻塞和电子效应。这一过程特别适用于在催化剂的作用下从烷基卤化物和硼酸合成手性醇。
