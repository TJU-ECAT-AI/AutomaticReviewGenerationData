[1] "Based on experimental and computational studies, a possible reaction pathway was proposed that the hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generated the active sites, and triggered ethane dehydrogenation."
[2] "This novel metal-free catalyst system enriches our knowledge on catalytic activation of alkanes and serves as a promising catalyst for the industrial ODH process."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, especially 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The 1-D edge active sites enable dynamic hydrogen abstraction by molecular oxygen, which generates the active sites responsible for triggering ethane dehydrogenation. This process contributes to the development of a promising metal-free catalyst system that enhances the knowledge of catalytic activation of alkanes and is suitable for industrial oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
