1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Particulate boron-based catalysts face limitations such as high pressure drop and poor mass transfer, which hinder their large-scale industrial application. In contrast, monolithic honeycomb ceramic catalysts with well-developed straight channels enable efficient dispersion of active phases, facilitate catalyst use, minimize residence time differences, and reduce pressure drop under high space velocities.

2. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance with low boron oxide loading. It achieves outstanding propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, including propylene and ethylene), and minimal CO2 production (0.1%) at a 16.9% propane conversion rate under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1. This results in a high propylene space-time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by effectively suppressing over-oxidation.

3. The B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst is recognized as a competitive option for ODHP, showcasing its ability to achieve high selectivity and productivity in the reaction.

1. 催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。颗粒状硼基催化剂面临高压力降和催化剂颗粒内低质量传输的问题，这些限制了它们的大规模工业应用。相比之下，具有良好直通道的多孔陶瓷多孔催化剂能够促进活性相的分散和高效利用催化剂，缩小停留时间差异，并在高空间速度下降低压力降。

2. 准备的B2O3/SiO2@HC多孔催化剂表现出良好的催化性能，其硼氧化物负载量低。它在16.9%丙烷转化率下，在高气体小时空间速度（GHSV）为345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1时，实现了出色的丙烯选择性（86.0%），烯烃选择性（97.6%，包括丙烯和乙烯）和微量二氧化碳（0.1%）。这通过有效抑制过氧化导致的高丙烯时空产率为15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1。

3. B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂被认定为ODHP的竞争力强的选择，展示了其在反应中实现高选择性和生产力的能力。
