[1] "The first coated SiO2 played crucial role in stabilizing the active boron species."
[2] "The monolithic catalyst showed high propylene productivity under ODH conditions."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."
[4] "The advantages of monolithic structure were also discussed on the basis of catalytic performance under high GHSV."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms enables the design of more efficient catalysts. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst, with its edge hydroxylated boron sites, exhibits excellent performance, achieving a high propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%), and negligible CO2 production (0.1%). This high performance is attributed to the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, as well as the improved mass transfer facilitated by the honeycomb structure. The 1-D edge active sites allow for better utilization of the active components and shorter diffusion paths, effectively suppressing overoxidation and enhancing the propylene productivity.

B催化剂中的活性位点的空间分布和维度，尤其是1-D边缘活性位点，在氧化脱氢反应中对丙烷（ODHP）的性能有显著影响。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂。B2O3/SiO2@HC多孔催化剂通过其边缘羟基化硼位点表现出优异的性能，实现了高丙烯选择性（86.0%）、高烯烃选择性（97.6%）以及极低的CO2生成量（0.1%）。这种高性能归因于在改性SiO2@HC支持上高效分散和牢固附着的活性B2O3层，以及由蜂窝结构带来的改进的传质。1-D边缘活性位点允许更好地利用活性成分并缩短扩散路径，有效抑制过氧化并增强丙烯产率。
