The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes greatly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The monolithic structure of the B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst enhances mass transfer, shortens diffusion paths, and restrains overoxidation, leading to high propylene productivity and selectivity. The uniform flow distribution within the monolithic structure facilitates the utilization of active components, resulting in improved catalyst performance.
