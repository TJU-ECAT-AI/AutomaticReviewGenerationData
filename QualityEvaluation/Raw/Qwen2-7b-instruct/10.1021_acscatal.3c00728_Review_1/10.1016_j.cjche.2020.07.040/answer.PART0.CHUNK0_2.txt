[1] "The high selectivity toward olefin (97.2%) and negligible production of CO2 (0.1%) under high space velocity gave a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6(g B2O3)1·h1 for ODHP."
[2] "The monolithic structure allows a uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the monolithic wall shorten the diffusion paths so that the overoxidation was restrained."
[3] "This result is better than that over traditional metal oxide catalysts and also better than that over the most of boron-based catalysts ( Fig. 7 b)."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These 1-D sites allow for a more efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts. The monolithic structure of the catalyst enhances mass transfer, reduces diffusion paths, and restrains overoxidation. As a result, the catalyst exhibits high propylene productivity under high space velocities, surpassing traditional metal oxide catalysts and most boron-based catalysts.

在氧化脱氢反应中，B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，尤其是1-D边缘活性位点，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有着显著的影响。这些1-D位点允许活性B2O3层在修改后的SiO2@HC支撑上更有效地分散并牢固附着。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂。多孔结构的催化剂能够促进质量传输，缩短扩散路径，并限制过氧化。因此，该催化剂在高空间速度下表现出高的丙烯产率，超过传统金属氧化物催化剂和大多数硼基催化剂。
