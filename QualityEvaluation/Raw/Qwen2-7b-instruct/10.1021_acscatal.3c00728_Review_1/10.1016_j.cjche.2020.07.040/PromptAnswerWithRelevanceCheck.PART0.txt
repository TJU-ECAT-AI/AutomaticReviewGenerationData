The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts. In the context of the honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst, the 1-D edge active sites contribute to the high propylene selectivity (97.6%) and negligible CO2 production (0.1%) under high space velocity, resulting in a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1. The monolithic structure facilitates a uniform flow distribution and shortens diffusion paths, which helps to restrain overoxidation and enhance the overall catalytic performance.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms enables the design of more efficient catalysts. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst, with its edge hydroxylated boron sites, exhibits excellent performance, achieving a high propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%), and negligible CO2 production (0.1%). This high performance is attributed to the efficient dispersion and firm attachment of the catalytically active B2O3 layer on the modified SiO2@HC support, as well as the improved mass transfer facilitated by the honeycomb structure. The 1-D edge active sites allow for better utilization of the active components and shorter diffusion paths, effectively suppressing overoxidation and enhancing the propylene productivity.

1. The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Particulate boron-based catalysts face limitations such as high pressure drop and poor mass transfer, which hinder their large-scale industrial application. In contrast, monolithic honeycomb ceramic catalysts with well-developed straight channels enable efficient dispersion of active phases, facilitate catalyst use, minimize residence time differences, and reduce pressure drop under high space velocities.

2. The B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance with low boron oxide loading. It achieves outstanding propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, including propylene and ethylene), and minimal CO2 production (0.1%) at a 16.9% propane conversion rate under a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1. This results in a high propylene space-time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by effectively suppressing over-oxidation.

3. The B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst is recognized as a competitive option for ODHP, showcasing its ability to achieve high selectivity and productivity in the reaction.
