[1] "The honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst was designed and prepared by a two-step coating method."
[2] "The monolithic structure allows a uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the monolithic wall shorten the diffusion paths so that the overoxidation was restrained."
[3] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1, leading to a high propylene space time yield of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1 by suppressing the overoxidation."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts. In the context of the honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst, the 1-D edge active sites contribute to the high propylene selectivity (97.6%) and negligible CO2 production (0.1%) under high space velocity, resulting in a high propylene productivity of 15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1. The monolithic structure facilitates a uniform flow distribution and shortens diffusion paths, which helps to restrain overoxidation and enhance the overall catalytic performance.

在氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中，B基催化剂中的活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边活性位点，对它们的性能至关重要。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂。对于蜂窝状长石微孔B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂而言，在高空间速度下，1-D边活性位点能够提供高丙烯选择性（97.6%）和几乎无CO2产生（0.1%），从而实现高丙烯产率15.7 g C3H6·(g B2O3)1·h1。这种多孔结构有利于均匀的流体分布，并缩短扩散路径，有助于抑制过氧化反应，从而增强整体催化性能。
