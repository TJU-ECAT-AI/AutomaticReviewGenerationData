The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a critical role in influencing their performance during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, possess unique properties and reaction mechanisms that contribute to their exceptional selectivity for olefin production even at high conversion rates. This understanding is pivotal for designing more efficient catalysts suitable for commercial applications.
