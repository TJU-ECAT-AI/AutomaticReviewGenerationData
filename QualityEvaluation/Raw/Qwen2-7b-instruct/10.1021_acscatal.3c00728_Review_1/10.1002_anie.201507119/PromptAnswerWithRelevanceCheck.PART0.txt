[1] "The propane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated under atmospheric pressure at 590C."
[2] "After 24h, the dehydrogenation reaction showed a very small decrease in conversion of 0.17% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."
[3] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.1% after a 24h test."
[4] "On the other hand, for the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 43.8% to 28.3% after 24h."
[5] "The initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4h−1 near equilibrium (50%) in a feed of 16.2kPa C3H8, 20.3kPa H2, and N2 balance."
[6] "After 24h, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.1% after a 24h test."
[7] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was also lower than for the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."
[8] "The best yield at a low kd value clearly demonstrates the superior reactivity and stability of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst in the DHP reaction."
[9] "The increase in the specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was substantially larger than that of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst when the WHSV was increased from 1.9h−1 to 56.5h−1."
[10] "As shown in Figure4C, the amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study found that the Pt-Sn clusters supported on the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, which is characterized by a large amount of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, are exceptionally dispersed and stabilized. This unique structure allows for the enhancement of electronic interactions between the Pt and Sn atoms, leading to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. This results in an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with over 99% selectivity during the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The 2D sheet structure of the catalyst facilitates mass transfer and diffusion processes, contributing to its high reactivity and stability. The catalyst also shows superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties, as evidenced by the low amount of coke deposited on its surface compared to the reference catalyst. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

[13] "The amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst."
