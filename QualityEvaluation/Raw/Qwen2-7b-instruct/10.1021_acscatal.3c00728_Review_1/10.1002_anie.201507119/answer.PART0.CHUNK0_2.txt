[1] "The electronic states of active phases are another crucial factor that influences the catalytic behavior."
[2] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."
[3] "This unique structure could account for the formation of the highly dispersed and stabilized Pt-Sn clusters on its surface."
[4] "The increase in the specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was substantially larger than that of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst when the WHSV was increased from 1.9h1 to 56.5h1."
[5] "These results account for the experimental observation that the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was only slightly deactivated during a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, whereas a dramatic deactivation was observed for the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites exhibit unique properties and reaction mechanisms that contribute to more efficient catalyst designs for commercial applications. The document elucidates how the presence of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions on γ-Al2O3 nanosheets enhances electronic interactions between Pt and Sn atoms, leading to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. This results in an outstanding specific activity for propylene formation with over 99% selectivity, minimizing coke formation and sintering processes. Furthermore, the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitates mass transfer and diffusion during propane dehydrogenation, which is critical for the reaction kinetics. Understanding these aspects allows for the optimization of catalysts that are highly active and stable, thereby improving commercial efficiency.
