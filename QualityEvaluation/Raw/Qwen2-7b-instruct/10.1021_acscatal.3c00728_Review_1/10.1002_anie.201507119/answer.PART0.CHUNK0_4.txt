[1] "The propane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated under atmospheric pressure at 590C."
[2] "The initial conversion of propane on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was 48.7% at a space velocity (WHSV) of 9.4h−1 near equilibrium (50%) in a feed of 16.2kPa C3H8, 20.3kPa H2, and N2 balance."
[3] "After 24h, the dehydrogenation reaction showed a very small decrease in conversion of 0.17% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred."
[4] "Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.1% after a 24h test."
[5] "For the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst, propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 43.8% to 28.3% after 24h."
[6] "The propylene yields of these two PtSn-based catalysts and previously developed catalysts are compared as a function of the deactivation rate in Figure3B."
[7] "The best yield at a low kd value clearly demonstrates the superior reactivity and stability of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst in the DHP reaction."
[8] "When an ultra-high WHSV of 56.5h−1 was used, a very high specific rate (i.e., the moles of C3H6 formed per mole of Pt per second) of 5.36s−1 and a low deactivation rate (0.014h−1) were achieved with the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."
[9] "This trend reveals that the sheet-like construction of the catalyst has a great impact on the catalyzed reactions, mostly likely by accelerating mass transfer and diffusion and, possibly, by allowing easy heat transfer."
[10] "The size and morphology of Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 sheet had undergone negligible changes even after a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, which demonstrates the excellent sintering resistance of this catalyst."
[11] "The amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst."
[12] "These results account for the experimental observation that the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was only slightly deactivated during a 24h dehydrogenation reaction, whereas a dramatic deactivation was observed for the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the study demonstrates that the Pt-Sn clusters supported on the Al2O3 nanosheet exhibit a raft-like structure, which enhances the electronic interactions between the two metals, leading to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. This unique structure enables the catalyst to display an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with over 99% selectivity, and minimizes coke formation and sintering processes. Moreover, the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitates mass-transfer and diffusion processes, which are crucial for the ODHP reaction. The Pt-Sn clusters' stability and high reactivity are attributed to the presence of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions on the Al2O3 nanosheet, which provides an excellent support for dispersing and stabilizing the clusters. The results suggest that understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these active sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the use of ultra-high space velocities (WHSV) of 56.5h−1 resulted in a high specific rate (5.36s−1) and low deactivation rate (0.014h−1) for the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, demonstrating its superior reactivity and stability compared to other Pt-based catalysts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的性能。具体而言，研究表明，支持在Al2O3纳米片上的Pt-Sn簇展现出筏状结构，这增强了两种金属之间的电子相互作用，导致Pt位点的电子密度增加。这种独特的结构使催化剂能够以超过99%的选择性催化丙烷转化为丙烯，并最小化焦炭形成和结块过程。此外，催化剂的片状构造促进了传质和扩散过程，这对于ODHP反应至关重要。Pt-Sn簇的稳定性和高活性归因于Al2O3纳米片上存在的五配位Al3+离子，它为分散和稳定簇提供了优秀的支撑。结果表明，理解这些活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，有助于设计更高效的商用催化剂。例如，使用超高的空间速度（WHSV）56.5h−1产生了高达5.36s−1的特定速率和低失活率0.014h−1，证明了PtSn/Al2O3片状催化剂相对于其他Pt基催化剂的优越活性和稳定性。
