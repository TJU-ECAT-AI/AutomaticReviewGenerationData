The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites contribute to the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity due to their unique properties and reaction mechanisms. Understanding these properties allows for the design of more efficient catalysts with enhanced activity and stability, particularly in commercial applications. The document showcases that γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions are exceptionally effective in dispersing and stabilizing raft-like Pt-Sn clusters, leading to an increase in the electron density of the Pt sites. This results in a catalyst that exhibits excellent activity and selectivity for propylene formation, minimal coke formation, and high stability. The use of ultra-high space velocities further enhances the catalyst's performance, demonstrating its potential for commercial application in ODHP reactions. The unique sheet-like architecture of the catalyst facilitates mass transfer and diffusion, inhibiting coke formation and enhancing the overall reaction kinetics. The analysis of spent catalysts confirms the high sintering resistance and minimal coke formation on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst, contributing to its prolonged stability and activity. Overall, the research highlights the importance of catalyst design and the role of specific site characteristics in achieving optimized performance for ODHP reactions.
