[1] "The 2D sheet structure might promote diffusion and thereby influence the catalytic behavior in the DHP reaction."
[2] "When higher space velocities are used, the effects of mass transfer and diffusion on the reaction rate will be more obvious."
[3] "The increase in the specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst was substantially larger than that of the PtSn/Al2O3ref. catalyst when the WHSV was increased from 1.9h1 to 56.5h1."
[4] "This trend reveals that the sheet-like construction of the catalyst has a great impact on the catalyzed reactions, mostly likely by accelerating mass transfer and diffusion and, possibly, by allowing easy heat transfer."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Understanding the importance of 1-D edge active sites allows for the development of catalysts that exhibit enhanced mass transfer and diffusion capabilities. This, in turn, leads to faster reaction rates and higher efficiency in ODHP reactions. The 2D sheet structure of the catalyst facilitates mass transfer and diffusion, enabling better performance in terms of reaction rate and efficiency. The increased specific activity of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst at higher space velocities indicates that the sheet-like construction of the catalyst accelerates mass transfer and diffusion, which is crucial for optimizing the ODHP process.
