Boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process.

The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation.

The high GHSV and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN contribute to the heat transfer during reactions.

Cordierite monolith is the most widely used catalyst support with low thermal expansivity, superior thermal stability, and good mechanical strength.

h-BN wash-coated cordierite catalyst was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for ODHP reaction, which exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability.

Considering the loading amount of active phase is a crucial factor for controlling the total reaction rate of a monolithic catalyst, the catalytic properties over h-BN/Cordierite with different h-BN loading were investigated.

The effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) to catalytic performance was evaluated. At a GHSV of 576,000mLgBN1h1, the selectivity towards C3H6 increased to 82.1% and no CO2 was detected, achieving a high space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1.

The adherenceness of the monolithic catalyst layer was evaluated according to a method described in the literature, based on the measurement of the weight loss caused by exposure to ultrasounds. The weight loss was only 1.5% even after 120min tests.

The h-BN/Cordierite catalyst can achieve high C3H8 throughput by increasing reaction temperature due to the excellent mass transfer process and highly efficient utilization of the active phase.

For the traditional monolithic catalyst, a secondary support with high specific surface area is usually coated onto the monolith prior to the active phase to enhance the dispersion and adherence of the active components.

In our case, the h-BN layer thickness for h-BN/Cordierite with h-BN loading amount of 4.2% is 3μm. Thus, we conclude that internal mass transfer is negligible for h-BN/Cordierite catalyst.
