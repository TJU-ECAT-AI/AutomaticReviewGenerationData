"Boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."
"Hence, its of great significance to develop a catalyst optimize mass transfer processes during the ODHP reaction. Monolithic catalysts have attracted great interests in recent years [ 16 ] due to their significant advantages such as better mass transfer, lower pressure drop and narrow residence time distribution."
"The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."
"Considering the loading amount of active phase is a crucial factor for controlling the total reaction rate of a monolithic catalyst, the catalytic properties over h-BN/Cordierite with different h-BN loading were investigated."
"Moreover, a high C3H8 throughput was achieved by improving the GHSV, leading to a high selectivity towards olefin while minimizing COx formation."
"We have shown that a h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity and stability for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. h-BN/Cordierite catalysts with different h-BN loading exhibit almost the same catalytic performance, indicating the improvement of h-BN utilization through coating h-BN on the surface of cordierite to form a thin layer."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly impact their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites facilitate better heat and mass transfer, optimizing the reaction conditions and reducing the risk of over-oxidation. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts. The monolithic structure of h-BN/Cordierite enhances mass transfer and heat transfer, improving selectivity and productivity towards light olefins while minimizing COx formation. The thin layer of h-BN coating on the surface of cordierite increases the utilization of the active phase, leading to consistent catalytic performance across different h-BN loadings. This results in high space time yields and selectivities, making the h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst attractive for industrial applications in ODHP.

在氧化脱氢反应中，硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。这些位点有助于优化热量和质量传递，降低过氧化的风险。理解这些位点的独特特性和反应机制允许设计更高效的催化剂。h-BN/Cordierite的多孔结构提高了质量和热传递，从而改善了轻烯烃的选择性和产率，同时减少了COx的形成。在表面涂覆一层薄的h-BN层上，可以提高活性相的利用效率，导致不同h-BN负载下的催化性能保持一致。这导致了高时空产率和选择性，使得h-BN/Cordierite多孔催化剂适用于工业ODHP应用。
