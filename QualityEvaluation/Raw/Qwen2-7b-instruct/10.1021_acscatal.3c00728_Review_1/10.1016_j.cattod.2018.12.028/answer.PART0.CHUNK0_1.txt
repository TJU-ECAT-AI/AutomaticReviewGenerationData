Boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process.
Monolithic catalysts have attracted great interests in recent years due to their significant advantages such as better mass transfer, lower pressure drop and narrow residence time distribution.
The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation.
The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder.
The adherence of the monolithic catalyst layer was evaluated according to a method described in the literature, based on the measurement of the weight loss caused by exposure to ultrasounds. The weight loss was only 1.5% even after 120min tests.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable enhanced heat and mass transfer processes, which are critical for optimizing the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst, with its optimized structure and thin wash-coated layer of h-BN, demonstrates high selectivity and productivity in ODHP reactions. This catalyst's ability to maintain high selectivity towards propylene and ethylene, while minimizing the formation of COx, showcases its potential for industrial application in propylene production from propane resources. The high propylene space time yield and optimized mass and heat transfer performance make the h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst an attractive choice for commercial use in ODHP reactions.
