[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), a non-metallic material with excellent chemical and thermal stability, has been widely researched in heterogenous catalysis."
[2] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts."
[3] "Furthermore, the excellent chemical and thermal stability of h-BN even at the oxidative atmosphere ensure the remarkable catalytic stability during ODHP reaction."
[4] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method."
[5] "Based on the abovementioned consideration, h-BN wash-coated cordierite catalyst was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for ODHP reaction, which exhibits excellent activity, selectivity and stability."
[6] "Monolithic catalysts have attracted great interests in recent years due to their significant advantages such as better mass transfer, lower pressure drop and narrow residence time distribution."
[7] "The catalytic performance over h-BN/Cordierite catalysts with different h-BN loading were tested, and the effect of gas hourly space velocity was investigated."
[8] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."
[9] "Meanwhile, the high GHSV and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN contribute to the heat transfer during reactions."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These unique sites contribute to enhanced activity and selectivity due to their specific reactivity and reaction mechanisms. Understanding the properties and mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By coating a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on cordierite, the catalyst shows improved activity, selectivity, and stability, especially when optimized for mass and heat transfer processes at high gas hourly space velocities. This results in a high space time yield and selective production of propylene and ethylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The high thermal conductivity of h-BN also aids in heat transfer during reactions, contributing to the overall efficiency of the catalyst in ODHP reactions.
