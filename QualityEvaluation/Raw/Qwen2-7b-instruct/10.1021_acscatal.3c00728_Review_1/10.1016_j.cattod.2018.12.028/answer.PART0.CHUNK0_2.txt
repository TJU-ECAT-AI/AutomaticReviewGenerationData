[1] "The h-BN/Cordierite catalyst can achieve high C3H8 throughput by increasing reaction temperature due to the excellent mass transfer process and highly efficient utilization of the active phase."
[2] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."
[3] "The adherence of the monolithic catalyst layer was evaluated according to a method described in the literature, based on the measurement of the weight loss caused by exposure to ultrasounds. The weight loss was only 1.5% even after 120min tests."
[4] "Both the light olefins selectivity and productivity are higher than the reported h-BN and most of metal oxide catalysts."
[5] "The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was within 5%."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites facilitate better mass transfer and efficient utilization of the active phase, leading to higher selectivity and productivity for olefin production. The unique properties of 1-D edge sites allow for optimized gas phase radical reactions, contributing to a higher propane conversion rate compared to bulk or powder forms of the catalyst. Additionally, the monolithic structure of the h-BN/Cordierite catalyst improves heat and mass transfer, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2. The adherence of the catalyst layer ensures mechanical stability, and the carbon balance confirms the effectiveness of the catalyst in converting propane with minimal losses. This combination of factors makes the h-BN/Cordierite monolithic catalyst an attractive option for industrial applications in the production of olefins from propane.
