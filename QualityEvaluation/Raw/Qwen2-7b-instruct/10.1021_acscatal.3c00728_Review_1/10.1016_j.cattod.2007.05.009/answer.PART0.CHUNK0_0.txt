1. The reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has been studied by numerous authors focusing on the impact of the support, V2O5 loading, and size of VOx domains on the catalyst's performance.

2. In propane ODH, increasing the V2O5 loading enhances catalytic activity, and the highest reaction rates per V atom occur on VOx domains of intermediate size, balancing the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants.

3. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium reduction is significantly lower than stoichiometric reduction, and only a fraction of the reduced centers are actively involved in catalytic turnovers, with the rest being re-oxidized over longer time scales.

4. Combinatorial and parallel systems, alongside genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection methods, have expanded the number of catalytic systems that can be explored, contributing to the discovery of new catalysts for ODH.

5. Some authors have noted the formation of hydrogen (H2) under typical conditions for alkanes ODH, highlighting its relevance to the reaction mechanisms and potential implications for catalyst design.

6. Most catalysts reported for propane ODH yield propylene at levels below 30%, indicating a significant challenge in achieving high propylene yields with current catalyst technologies.

1. 多位作者研究了钒氧化物在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）中的活性，关注支持、V2O5负载和VOx域尺寸对催化剂性能的影响。

2. 在丙烷ODH中，增加V2O5负载可以提高催化活性，而单位V原子的最大反应速率发生在中间大小的VOx域上，平衡了表面VOx物种的活性及其对反应物的可接近性。

3. 在稳态ODH过程中，钒的还原程度远低于其化学计量还原，只有部分还原中心在催化循环中积极参与，其余部分则在更长的时间尺度内被重新氧化。

4. 组合和并行系统，以及遗传算法和进化催化剂选择方法的应用，极大地增加了可探索的催化系统数量，为ODH发现新催化剂提供了重要贡献。

5. 一些作者报道了在典型条件下，烷烃ODH中氢（H2）的形成，这突出了反应机制的相关性和潜在的催化剂设计影响。

6. 报道的大多数丙烷ODH催化剂的丙烯产率低于30%，表明当前技术在实现高丙烯产率方面存在重大挑战。
