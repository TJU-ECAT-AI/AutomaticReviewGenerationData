1. The support's impact on vanadium oxide reactivity in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been studied by various researchers. This includes examining the properties of vanadium oxide in terms of kinetic steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds and the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen.

2. Reactivity data for catalysts using supported vanadium oxide for propane and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation consistently align with both the dissociation of CH bonds and the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen activation.

3. The extent of vanadium reduction during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is significantly lower than in stoichiometric reduction of vanadium pentoxide (V5+) to vanadium tetroxide (V4+) or vanadium trioxide (V3+).

4. The rates of propane oxidative dehydrogenation increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible DR spectrum decreases. These electronic transitions are mechanistically linked to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

5. The utilization of combinatorial and parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection methods, has significantly enhanced the ability to prepare and study catalytic systems, contributing to the discovery of novel catalysts.

6. The formation of hydrogen under typical conditions for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation has been noted by some authors. Sinev et al. identified non-oxidative dehydrogenation and coking as the main pathways for hydrogen formation in propane oxidative dehydrogenation.
