[1] "The case of propane ODH is different because the best yields reported are still far from being interesting for industrial implementation. Conditions leading to best propylene yields also lead to the co-production of significant amounts of ethylene; therefore, the finding of a catalyst capable of combining industrially acceptable conversion/productivity with specificity to this olefin is still the major objective."
