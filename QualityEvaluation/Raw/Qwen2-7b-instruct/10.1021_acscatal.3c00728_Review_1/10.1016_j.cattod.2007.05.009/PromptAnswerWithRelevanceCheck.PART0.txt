[1] "The case of propane ODH is different because the best yields reported are still far from being interesting for industrial implementation. Conditions leading to best propylene yields also lead to the co-production of significant amounts of ethylene; therefore, the finding of a catalyst capable of combining industrially acceptable conversion/productivity with specificity to this olefin is still the major objective."

1. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts tends to increase with the loading of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), reaching a peak on domains of intermediate size. This balances the activity of surface vanadium oxide species with their accessibility to reactants.

2. Reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide in propane and ethane ODH are consistent with both kinetic steps involving the dissociation of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds and a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in the activation of the CH bond.

3. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium (V) reduction is notably lower than for stoichiometric reduction from V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Only a portion of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the remainder are re-oxidized over much longer timescales compared to turnover times.

4. For propane ODH, the majority of catalysts reported in literature yield ethylene with percentages lower than 20%.

5. The best performance in propane ODH has been achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides.

[1] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation. The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers; the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. Surface oxygen, OH groups and, especially, oxygen vacancies are the most abundant reactive intermediates during ODH on active VOx domains."
[2] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends only on alkane/O2 ratios. The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities; therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane oxidation."
[3] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors...In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of V oxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading."
[4] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide...The addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane ODH."

1. The reactivity of catalysts for propane and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is consistent with both the dissociation of CH bonds and the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen activation. Active alkyl species form olefins, while the remaining OH groups recombine with neighboring OH groups to form water and reduced V centers, which are re-oxidized by O2. Surface oxygen, OH groups, and oxygen vacancies are the most abundant reactive intermediates during ODH on active VOx domains.

2. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium reduction is lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized over longer timescales. The number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends solely on alkane/O2 ratios. The fraction of V-atoms that exist as catalytically reduced centers increases with vanadia surface density and domain size until reaching typical polyvanadate monolayer densities, after which it stabilizes.

3. Silica-supported vanadium oxide catalysts are more selective than alumina-supported ones, and alumina is more selective than titania. This is mainly due to the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading.

4. Additives like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, nickel, chromium, niobium, magnesium, gold, zinc, and molybdenum, when added in relevant amounts relative to vanadium, modify the acid-basic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide. Adding alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases activity and increases selectivity to propylene in propane ODH.

5. Combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, have significantly expanded the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, contributing to the discovery of new catalysts.

6. Under typical conditions for alkanes ODH, bulk vanadium oxide adapts its properties based on reaction conditions, specifically gas-phase composition and temperature. This adaptation allows for the formation of hydrogen alongside other products.

1. 在丙烷和乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中，催化剂的反应活性与CH键的分解以及涉及晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen还原氧化机制一致。活性烷基物种形成烯烃，而剩余的OH团与邻近的OH团重新组合以形成水和还原的V中心，后者通过不可逆的离解化学吸附的O2再氧化。表面氧、OH团，尤其是氧空位是活性VOx区域中最多的活性中间体。

2. 在稳态ODH中，钒的还原程度低于V5+到V4+或V3+的定比还原。只有部分还原中心在催化循环中活跃，其余则在比循环时间长得多的时间尺度上被氧化。催化活性显著减少的还原中心的数量仅取决于烷烃/O2比例。随着范德亚表面密度和域大小的增加，存在作为催化还原中心的V原子的比例增加，直到达到典型的多聚瓦特酸盐单层密度，之后保持稳定。

3. 硅酸盐支持的二氧化钒催化剂比氧化铝支持的更选择性，氧化铝比二氧化钛更选择性。这主要是由于低范德亚负载时平行丙烷燃烧的较低程度。

4. 磷、钾、钙、镍、铬、铌、镁、金、锌和钼等添加剂，在相对于钒的合理量下，修改了支持的二氧化钒的酸碱性和还原氧化性质。添加碱土金属及其氧化物减少了活性并增加了丙烷ODH中的丙烯选择性。

5. 组合/并行系统，包括遗传算法和进化催化剂选择方法，极大地增加了可以准备和研究的催化系统的数量，为新催化剂的发现做出了重要贡献。

6. 在典型条件下进行烷烃ODH时，批量二氧化钒根据反应条件调整其属性，特别是气相组成和温度。这种适应性使氢与其他产物一起产生成为可能。
