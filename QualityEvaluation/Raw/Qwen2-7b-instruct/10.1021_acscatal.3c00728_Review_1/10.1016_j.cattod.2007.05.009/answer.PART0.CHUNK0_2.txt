[1] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[2] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[3] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[4] "In the case of propane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[5] "The best performance in propane ODH has been obtained with non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides."

1. In propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts tends to increase with the loading of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), reaching a peak on domains of intermediate size. This balances the activity of surface vanadium oxide species with their accessibility to reactants.

2. Reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide in propane and ethane ODH are consistent with both kinetic steps involving the dissociation of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds and a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in the activation of the CH bond.

3. During steady-state ODH, the extent of vanadium (V) reduction is notably lower than for stoichiometric reduction from V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Only a portion of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the remainder are re-oxidized over much longer timescales compared to turnover times.

4. For propane ODH, the majority of catalysts reported in literature yield ethylene with percentages lower than 20%.

5. The best performance in propane ODH has been achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中，钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随五氧化二钒（V2O5）负载量的增加而增加，达到峰值在中间大小的VOx域上，这平衡了表面VOx物种的活性与它们对反应物的可接近性。

2. 丙烷和乙烷ODH中，用支持的钒氧化物制备的催化剂的反应性数据既符合涉及丙烯碳氢（CH）键解离的热力学相关步骤，也符合涉及晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen还原机制，在CH键激活过程中。

3. 在稳态ODH过程中，钒(V)的减少程度远低于从V5+到V4+或V3+的等摩尔减少。只有部分还原中心在催化循环中活跃，而其余部分在比循环时间长得多的时间尺度上被重新氧化。

4. 对于丙烷ODH，大多数文献报道的催化剂的乙烯产率低于20%。

5. 在丙烷ODH中，使用不可还原的碱金属或碱土金属氧化物取得了最佳性能。
