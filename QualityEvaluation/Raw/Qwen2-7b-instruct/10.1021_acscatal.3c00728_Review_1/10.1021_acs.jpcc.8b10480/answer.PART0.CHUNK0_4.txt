The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in their performance during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, the dimensionality affects how effectively these catalysts can activate oxygen and promote the dehydrogenation process. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites is essential for designing more efficient catalysts suitable for commercial use.
