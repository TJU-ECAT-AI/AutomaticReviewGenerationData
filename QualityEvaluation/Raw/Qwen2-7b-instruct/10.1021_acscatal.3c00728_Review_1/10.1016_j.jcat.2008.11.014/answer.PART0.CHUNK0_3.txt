The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function. To this end, the catalysts were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopyenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEMEDXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).

• At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains merely isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination whereas γ-Al2O3 contains, besides isolated sites, a fraction of oligomers (including dimers).
• At 5 wt% Cr, besides a fraction of monomers, crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles are mainly formed on SBA-15 while, remarkably such crystals are not formed rather oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity are mainly formed on γ-Al2O3.

• At 1 wt% chromium, SBA-15 contains solely isolated chromium(VI) species in coordination, whereas γ-Al2O3 contains, in addition to isolated sites, a portion of oligomers (including dimers). 
• At 5 wt% chromium, in addition to a fraction of monomers, crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles are predominantly formed on SBA-15. Remarkably, such crystals are not formed, rather oligomers with varying degrees of nuclearity are mainly formed on γ-Al2O3.

• 在1 wt% 铬的情况下，SBA-15仅包含协调的孤立铬(VI)物种，而γ-Al2O3除包含孤立位点外，还包含一部分寡聚体（包括二聚体）。
• 在5 wt% 铬的情况下，除了部分单体，SBA-15主要形成晶格α-Cr2O3颗粒。值得注意的是，在γ-Al2O3中没有形成这样的晶体，而是主要形成了具有不同核度的寡聚体。

• In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS.
• The intrinsic catalytic activity of Cr species (isolated or oligomers) depends on the support (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they have been stabilized as evidenced by the catalytic results.
• In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr species stabilized on xCrAl2O3 for DHP.

• In situ XANES studies show that isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increases (>4) upon contact with C3H8. This is also confirmed by in situ EXAFS.
• The intrinsic catalytic activity of Cr species (isolated or oligomers) is dependent on the support (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they have been stabilized, as demonstrated by the catalytic results.
• In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective, and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr species stabilized on xCrAl2O3 for DHP.

• 原地XANES研究表明，协调的孤立Cr(VI)物种立即还原为Cr(III)，其配位数增加至大于4，这在与C3H8接触时得到证实。这也由原地EXAFS证实。
• Cr物种（孤立或寡聚体）的内在催化活性依赖于它们被稳定的支持（SBA-15或Al2O3），这一结果通过催化实验得到了证明。
• 在xCrSBA-15中，配位数大于四的孤立Cr(III)物种比表面晶态Cr2O3上的Cr位点更活跃、选择性更高且更稳定。相反，寡聚Cr物种对于DHP而言比在xCrAl2O3上稳定化的孤立Cr物种更活跃、选择性更高。
