<p>Remarkably, γ-Al2O3 contains mainly oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity and a fraction of isolated species but no Cr2O3 particles.</p>
<p>For xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.</p>
<p>In contrast, for xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than the isolated Cr sites.</p>

1. γ-Al2O3 predominantly contains oligomers with varying nuclearity alongside a portion of isolated species, without any Cr2O3 particles.
2. In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) sites having a coordination number exceeding four exhibit higher activity, selectivity, and stability compared to Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3.
3. For xCrAl2O3, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr sites.

1. γ-Al2O3主要包含具有不同核度的寡聚体以及部分孤立物种，没有Cr2O3粒子。
2. 在xCrSBA-15中，具有超过四个配位数的孤立Cr(III)位点的活性、选择性和稳定性高于表面Cr2O3粒子上的Cr位点。
3. 对于xCrAl2O3，寡聚型Cr物种的活性和选择性高于孤立的Cr位点。
