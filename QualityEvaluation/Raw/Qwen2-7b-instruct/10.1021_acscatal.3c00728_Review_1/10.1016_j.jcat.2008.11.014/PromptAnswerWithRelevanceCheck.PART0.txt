The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), are significantly influenced by the type of support material used. In the study of chromium (Cr)-based catalysts, it was found that the nature of active sites, whether isolated or oligomeric, varies depending on the support, such as SBA-15 or γ-Al2O3. 

On SBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with a coordination number greater than four demonstrated higher activity, selectivity, and stability compared to Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. Conversely, oligomeric Cr species were found to be more active and selective than isolated Cr species on γ-Al2O3 for the dehydrogenation of propane. However, these oligomeric species were more sensitive to regeneration processes, leading to structural changes that affected their catalytic performance. 

This research highlights the critical role of support in determining the catalytic activity and stability of active sites. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms, particularly for 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The findings provide insights into optimizing the structure of catalysts to enhance their performance in ODHP and similar dehydrogenation reactions.

在B基催化剂中，特别是氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）的背景下，活性位点的空间分布和维度受所使用的支持材料类型显著影响。在对铬（Cr）基催化剂的研究中，发现活性位点的性质，无论是孤立的还是寡聚的，取决于支持物，如SBA-15或γ-Al2O3。

在SBA-15上，与四以上配位数的孤立Cr(III)物种相比，Cr物种在晶态Cr2O3表面的活性、选择性和稳定性更高。相反，在γ-Al2O3上，寡聚Cr物种比孤立Cr物种在丙烷脱氢反应中更活跃和选择性更强。然而，这些寡聚物种在再生过程中更加敏感，导致其结构变化，进而影响其催化性能。

这项研究强调了支持物在确定催化活性和稳定性方面的重要作用。理解这些独特的属性和反应机制，特别是对于1-D边缘活性位点，对于设计更高效的催化剂以供商业应用具有重大意义。研究结果提供了优化催化剂结构以增强其在ODHP和类似脱氢反应性能方面的见解。
