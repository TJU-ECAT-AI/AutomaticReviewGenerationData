There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity.
The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics15 and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.

The literature does not directly address the questions about B-based catalysts and their influence on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reactions. However, it provides information on graphene devices fabricated on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates, which might indirectly relate to catalysts. The key points include the improvement in device quality when graphene is placed on h-BN substrates, such as enhanced mobility and reduced roughness compared to devices on silicon dioxide (SiO2). Additionally, the article mentions the potential for assembling complex graphene heterostructures, which could imply advancements in catalytic materials. To understand how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts affect their performance, one would need to explore the specific mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on these materials, which is not covered in the provided text.

The ability of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a substrate for graphene devices offers several advantages over standard SiO2 substrates. Specifically, graphene on h-BN shows significantly improved device quality, as evidenced by higher mobilities and reduced carrier inhomogeneities, roughness, intrinsic doping, and chemical reactivity compared to graphene on SiO2. This is due to h-BN's atomically smooth surface, absence of dangling bonds and charge traps, and lattice constant similar to graphite, which contributes to its large optical phonon modes and electrical bandgap. The enhanced performance of graphene devices on h-BN facilitates the fabrication of higher-quality electronic components and supports the development of more complex graphene heterostructures.

The ability of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a substrate for graphene devices is highlighted in the literature. It provides an atomically smooth surface, free of dangling bonds and charge traps, which leads to high-quality graphene devices with improved mobility and reduced roughness compared to devices on SiO2 substrates. This improvement is attributed to the lattice constant similarity with graphite, large optical phonon modes, and a large electrical bandgap of h-BN. The literature also mentions that the use of h-BN as a substrate enables the assembly of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics and facilitates the creation of more complex graphene heterostructures.
