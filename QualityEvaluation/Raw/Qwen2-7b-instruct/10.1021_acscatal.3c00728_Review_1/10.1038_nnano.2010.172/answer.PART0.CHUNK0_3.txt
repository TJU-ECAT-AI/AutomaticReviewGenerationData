[1] "Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2."
[2] "These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms, especially concerning 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. This includes enhanced mobility and carrier inhomogeneity, reduced roughness, intrinsic doping, and chemical reactivity in graphene devices on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates compared to those on standard SiO2 substrates.
