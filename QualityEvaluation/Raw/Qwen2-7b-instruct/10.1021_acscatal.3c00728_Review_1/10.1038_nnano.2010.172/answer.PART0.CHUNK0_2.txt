[2] "There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample."
[3] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps."
[4] "It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap."
[5] "Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2."
[6] "These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity."

The ability of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a substrate for graphene devices offers several advantages over standard SiO2 substrates. Specifically, graphene on h-BN shows significantly improved device quality, as evidenced by higher mobilities and reduced carrier inhomogeneities, roughness, intrinsic doping, and chemical reactivity compared to graphene on SiO2. This is due to h-BN's atomically smooth surface, absence of dangling bonds and charge traps, and lattice constant similar to graphite, which contributes to its large optical phonon modes and electrical bandgap. The enhanced performance of graphene devices on h-BN facilitates the fabrication of higher-quality electronic components and supports the development of more complex graphene heterostructures.

对于石墨烯设备而言，六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为基底提供了多种优势，这优于标准的SiO2基底。具体来说，石墨烯在h-BN上的性能显著提高，体现在更高的迁移率、更低的载流子不均匀性、粗糙度、内在掺杂和化学反应性方面，与SiO2基底上的石墨烯相比有近一个数量级的提升。这是由于h-BN表面原子级光滑，无游离键和电荷陷阱，以及其与石墨类似的晶格常数，这有助于形成较大的光学声子模式和电气能带隙。h-BN作为基底使高质素电子组件的制造成为可能，并支持更复杂石墨烯异构体的实现。
