The ability of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a substrate for graphene devices is highlighted in the literature. It provides an atomically smooth surface, free of dangling bonds and charge traps, which leads to high-quality graphene devices with improved mobility and reduced roughness compared to devices on SiO2 substrates. This improvement is attributed to the lattice constant similarity with graphite, large optical phonon modes, and a large electrical bandgap of h-BN. The literature also mentions that the use of h-BN as a substrate enables the assembly of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics and facilitates the creation of more complex graphene heterostructures.

文献中提到了六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为石墨烯设备基板的能力。它提供了一个原子级光滑的表面，几乎没有悬垂键和电荷陷阱，这导致了与SiO2基板上的设备相比，石墨烯设备的移动性和粗糙度降低。这种改善归因于h-BN的晶格常数与石墨相似、较大的光学声子模式以及较大的电能隙。文献还提到使用h-BN作为基板允许在其他有前景的介质上组装石墨烯设备，并且能够实现更复杂的石墨烯异质结构。
