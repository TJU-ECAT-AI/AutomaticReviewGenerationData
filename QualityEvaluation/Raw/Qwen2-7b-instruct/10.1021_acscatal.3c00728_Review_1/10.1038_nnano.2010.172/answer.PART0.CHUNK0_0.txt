There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity.
The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics15 and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.

The document discusses the fabrication and characterization of high-quality graphene devices on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates. The devices exhibit superior quality compared to those on standard SiO2 substrates, as evidenced by higher mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities. Additionally, the devices show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping, and chemical reactivity. This highlights the potential of h-BN as an effective substrate for graphene devices, offering improvements over traditional SiO2 substrates in terms of device quality and functionality.
