The literature does not directly address the questions about B-based catalysts and their influence on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reactions. However, it provides information on graphene devices fabricated on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates, which might indirectly relate to catalysts. The key points include the improvement in device quality when graphene is placed on h-BN substrates, such as enhanced mobility and reduced roughness compared to devices on silicon dioxide (SiO2). Additionally, the article mentions the potential for assembling complex graphene heterostructures, which could imply advancements in catalytic materials. To understand how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts affect their performance, one would need to explore the specific mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions on these materials, which is not covered in the provided text.

文献并未直接回答关于基于B的催化剂及其对丙烷氧化脱氢反应性能的影响的问题。然而，它提供了在六方氮化硼（h-BN）基板上制备石墨烯设备的信息，这可能间接与催化剂相关。关键点包括将石墨烯放置在h-BN基板上的设备质量改进，如与二氧化硅（SiO2）基板相比，提高了迁移率并减少了粗糙度。此外，文章提到组装复杂石墨烯异质结构的可能性，这可能意味着催化材料的进展。要了解活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响基于B的催化剂的性能，需要探索这些材料上的氧化脱氢反应的具体机制，这在提供的文本中没有涵盖。
