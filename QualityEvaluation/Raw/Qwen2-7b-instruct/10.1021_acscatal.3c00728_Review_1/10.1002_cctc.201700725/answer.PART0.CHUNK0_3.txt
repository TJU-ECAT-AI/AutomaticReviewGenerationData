[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "However, most reports showed that BN materials usually terminated as zigzag edges and were difficult to be oxidized by O2 (>800C)."
[4] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation."
[5] "Remarkably, the results (in red circles) transcend those of nonprecious metal catalysts and are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts (Pt and Pt-Sn for the ODH of ethane, and Pt-Sn/MgAlO for the DH of ethane; see also FigureS2);5c, 12 the S was maintained at values of 100, 92, and 80% at C2H6 conversions (X ) of 9.2, 19, and 43%."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron nitride (BN) catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites are crucial for the selective activation of propane molecules. These sites, which are present at the arm-chair edges of BN nanosheets, enable the onsite activation of O2 to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, leading to the cleavage of the non-terminal C-H bond in propane. The BOH group within the BN structure is responsible for hydrogen abstraction from propane to form propene, while simultaneously preventing overoxidation to carbon dioxide. Most reports indicate that BN materials typically terminate as zigzag edges, which are less reactive compared to arm-chair edges. However, the authors anticipated that the activation of O2 should commence with the activation of the alkane molecules. The results demonstrate that the BN catalysts, particularly the high-surface-area boron nitride nanosheet (s-BN), exhibit superior performance in ODHP reactions, achieving selectivities of 100%, 92%, and 80% at propane conversions of 9.2%, 19%, and 43%, respectively. These findings surpass those of non-precious metal catalysts and are competitive with Pt-based catalysts.

在硼氮化物（BN）催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能。特别是，一维边缘活性位点对于丙烷分子的选择性活化至关重要。这些位点位于BN纳米片的臂椅边缘上，能够现场激活氧气形成B-O-O-N中间体，从而导致丙烷非端基C-H键的断裂。BN结构中的BOH组分负责从丙烷分子中抽取氢原子以形成丙烯，并同时防止过氧化生成二氧化碳。大多数报告指出，BN材料通常终止为锯齿形边缘，其活性远低于臂椅边缘。然而，作者预测O2的激活应首先从烷烃分子的激活开始。结果表明，BN催化剂，尤其是高表面积的BN纳米片，在ODHP反应中表现出优越的性能，分别在丙烷转化率为9.2%、19%和43%时达到100%、92%和80%的选择性。这些发现超越了非贵金属催化剂的表现，并与铂基催化剂相媲美。
