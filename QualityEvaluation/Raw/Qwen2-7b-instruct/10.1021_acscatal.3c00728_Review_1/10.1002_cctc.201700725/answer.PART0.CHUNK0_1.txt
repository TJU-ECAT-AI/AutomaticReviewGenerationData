[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation."
[4] "Remarkably, the results (in red circles) transcend those of nonprecious metal catalysts and are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts (Pt and Pt-Sn for the ODH of ethane, and Pt-Sn/MgAlO for the DH of ethane; see also FigureS2);5c, 12 the S was maintained at values of 100, 92, and 80% at C2H6 conversions (X ) of 9.2, 19, and 43%."
[5] "Consistently, the vibrational features found by Raman ( =882cm1, BO from H3BO3)14 and IR ( =1217cm1 for BO and =3231cm1 for OH)15 spectroscopy suggested the presence of BO species without any clear change in the N-related vibrations."
[6] "Interestingly, a BO signature (at a binding energy of 193eV in the B1s spectrum)13 emerged in the used catalyst (after high X operation), whereas no change in the N1s feature was observed."
[7] "The stage at which O2 is indeed activated was revealed by an 18O isotope tracer, in the presence and absence of ethane."
[8] "This is reinforced by the absence of a BO vibration ( =1220cm1) under flow of only O2 (Figure2a, step2), which revealed the inability of s-BN to activate (or react with) O2 under mild conditions."
[9] "Our observations with operando spectroscopy offered important messages towards the understanding of the ODH reaction and the rational design of catalysts, particularly those of the nonmetal category: O2 adsorption but not dissociation is key to a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction."

Answer: The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites, especially those located at the edges of boron nitride (BN) materials, enable the activation of O2 without its dissociation, leading to controlled activation of aliphatic CH bonds. This mechanism prevents overoxidation to CO2 and ensures the exclusive conversion of propane into olefins. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts, particularly in the nonmetal category, that can achieve high selectivity and yield in commercial applications. The presence of BOH and BO groups at the BN edges facilitates the hydrogen abstraction and dehydrogenation processes, respectively, contributing to the rational design of catalysts for optimized performance.

答案：B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。这些位点，特别是在硼氮（BN）材料边缘的位置，能够实现O2的吸附而不使其分解，从而实现对烷烃CH键的可控激活。这一机制防止了过氧化产生二氧化碳，并确保了丙烷的独家转化成烯烃。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制允许设计更高效的催化剂，尤其是非金属类别，可以在商业应用中实现高选择性和产量。BOH和BO组在BN边缘的存在促进了氢提取和脱氢过程，分别贡献于催化剂设计的合理化，以优化其性能。
