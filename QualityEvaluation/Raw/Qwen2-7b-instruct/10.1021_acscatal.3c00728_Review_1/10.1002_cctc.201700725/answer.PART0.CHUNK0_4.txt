"Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
"A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron nitride (BN) catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites, such as BOH groups, play crucial roles in the reaction mechanism. These sites are capable of activating O2 to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, which facilitates the cleavage of the nonterminal CH bond in propane. The BOH group is responsible for hydrogen abstraction from propane to produce propene, while simultaneously preventing overoxidation to CO2. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the rational design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

在硼氮化物（BN）催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的性能产生了显著影响。特别是，1-D边界的活性位点，如BOH组分，在反应机制中扮演关键角色。这些位点能够激活氧气形成B-O-O-N中间体，从而促进丙烷非末端C-H键的断裂。BOH组分负责从丙烷中提取氢原子生成丙烯，并同时防止过度氧化生成CO2。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于合理设计更高效的催化剂以应用于商业应用。
