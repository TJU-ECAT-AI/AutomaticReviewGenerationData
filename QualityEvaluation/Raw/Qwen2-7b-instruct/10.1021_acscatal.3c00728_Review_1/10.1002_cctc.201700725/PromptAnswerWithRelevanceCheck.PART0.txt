[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane; as such, unprecedented selectivity for ethylene without CO2 formation under the weak oxidation conditions was found."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites enable the selective activation of propane molecules, allowing for the formation of propene with high efficiency and without overoxidation to CO2. Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms associated with these edge active sites, such as their ability to activate O2 directly and facilitate the dehydrogenation process, contributes greatly to the rational design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

[5] "Consistently, the vibrational features found by Raman ( =882cm1, BO from H3BO3)14 and IR ( =1217cm1 for BO and =3231cm1 for OH)15 spectroscopy suggested the presence of BO species without any clear change in the N-related vibrations."
[6] "Interestingly, a BO signature (at a binding energy of 193eV in the B1s spectrum)13 emerged in the used catalyst (after high X operation), whereas no change in the N1s feature was observed."
[7] "The stage at which O2 is indeed activated was revealed by an 18O isotope tracer, in the presence and absence of ethane."
[8] "This is reinforced by the absence of a BO vibration ( =1220cm1) under flow of only O2 (Figure2a, step2), which revealed the inability of s-BN to activate (or react with) O2 under mild conditions."
[9] "Our observations with operando spectroscopy offered important messages towards the understanding of the ODH reaction and the rational design of catalysts, particularly those of the nonmetal category: O2 adsorption but not dissociation is key to a combustion-free paraffin ODH reaction."

Answer: The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. These sites, especially those located at the edges of boron nitride (BN) materials, enable the activation of O2 without its dissociation, leading to controlled activation of aliphatic CH bonds. This mechanism prevents overoxidation to CO2 and ensures the exclusive conversion of propane into olefins. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms allows for the design of more efficient catalysts, particularly in the nonmetal category, that can achieve high selectivity and yield in commercial applications. The presence of BOH and BO groups at the BN edges facilitates the hydrogen abstraction and dehydrogenation processes, respectively, contributing to the rational design of catalysts for optimized performance.

答案：B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。这些位点，特别是在硼氮（BN）材料边缘的位置，能够实现O2的吸附而不使其分解，从而实现对烷烃CH键的可控激活。这一机制防止了过氧化产生二氧化碳，并确保了丙烷的独家转化成烯烃。理解这些独特的性质和反应机制允许设计更高效的催化剂，尤其是非金属类别，可以在商业应用中实现高选择性和产量。BOH和BO组在BN边缘的存在促进了氢提取和脱氢过程，分别贡献于催化剂设计的合理化，以优化其性能。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the arm-chair BN edge is capable of activating O2 to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, facilitating the rupture of the nonterminal CH bond in propane. The BOH group in boron nitride plays a crucial role in hydrogen abstraction from propane, preventing overoxidation to CO2. These findings demonstrate that the active sites, such as BO(H) and BO, are formed at the edges of BN by the aid of propane, and the formation of these sites enables the exclusive conversion of propane into propene with high selectivity. Moreover, the results indicate that the presence of propane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN, leading to the formation of BO(H) sites, which complete the dehydrogenation cycle.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in boron nitride (BN) catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Specifically, 1-D edge active sites are crucial for the selective activation of propane molecules. These sites, which are present at the arm-chair edges of BN nanosheets, enable the onsite activation of O2 to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, leading to the cleavage of the non-terminal C-H bond in propane. The BOH group within the BN structure is responsible for hydrogen abstraction from propane to form propene, while simultaneously preventing overoxidation to carbon dioxide. Most reports indicate that BN materials typically terminate as zigzag edges, which are less reactive compared to arm-chair edges. However, the authors anticipated that the activation of O2 should commence with the activation of the alkane molecules. The results demonstrate that the BN catalysts, particularly the high-surface-area boron nitride nanosheet (s-BN), exhibit superior performance in ODHP reactions, achieving selectivities of 100%, 92%, and 80% at propane conversions of 9.2%, 19%, and 43%, respectively. These findings surpass those of non-precious metal catalysts and are competitive with Pt-based catalysts.

在硼氮化物（BN）催化剂中，活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能。特别是，一维边缘活性位点对于丙烷分子的选择性活化至关重要。这些位点位于BN纳米片的臂椅边缘上，能够现场激活氧气形成B-O-O-N中间体，从而导致丙烷非端基C-H键的断裂。BN结构中的BOH组分负责从丙烷分子中抽取氢原子以形成丙烯，并同时防止过氧化生成二氧化碳。大多数报告指出，BN材料通常终止为锯齿形边缘，其活性远低于臂椅边缘。然而，作者预测O2的激活应首先从烷烃分子的激活开始。结果表明，BN催化剂，尤其是高表面积的BN纳米片，在ODHP反应中表现出优越的性能，分别在丙烷转化率为9.2%、19%和43%时达到100%、92%和80%的选择性。这些发现超越了非贵金属催化剂的表现，并与铂基催化剂相媲美。
