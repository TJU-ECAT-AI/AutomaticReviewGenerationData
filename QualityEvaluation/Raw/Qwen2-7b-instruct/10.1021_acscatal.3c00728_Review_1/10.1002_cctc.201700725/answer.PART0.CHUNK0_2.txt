[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."
[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."
[3] "We therefore anticipated that O2 activation should be initiated by CH activation. Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane."
[4] "Remarkably, the results (in red circles) transcend those of nonprecious metal catalysts and are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts (Pt and Pt-Sn for the ODH of ethane, and Pt-Sn/MgAlO for the DH of ethane; see also FigureS2);5c, 12 the S was maintained at values of 100, 92, and 80% at C2H6 conversions (X ) of 9.2, 19, and 43%."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. For instance, the arm-chair BN edge is capable of activating O2 to form a B-O-O-N intermediate, facilitating the rupture of the nonterminal CH bond in propane. The BOH group in boron nitride plays a crucial role in hydrogen abstraction from propane, preventing overoxidation to CO2. These findings demonstrate that the active sites, such as BO(H) and BO, are formed at the edges of BN by the aid of propane, and the formation of these sites enables the exclusive conversion of propane into propene with high selectivity. Moreover, the results indicate that the presence of propane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN, leading to the formation of BO(H) sites, which complete the dehydrogenation cycle.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有着显著影响。这些位点的独特性质和反应机制为设计更高效的商用催化剂提供了依据。例如，BN的臂椅边缘能够激活O2形成B-O-O-N中间体，从而促进丙烷非末端CH键的断裂。硼氮化物中的BOH组分在丙烷脱氢过程中发挥关键作用，防止过度氧化生成CO2。这些发现表明，通过丙烷的作用，BN边缘形成了BO(H)和BO等活性位点，使得丙烷的独家转化为丙烯具有高选择性。此外，结果表明，丙烷的存在促进了吸附态O2向BN边缘的活化，导致BO(H)位点的形成，最终完成脱氢循环。
