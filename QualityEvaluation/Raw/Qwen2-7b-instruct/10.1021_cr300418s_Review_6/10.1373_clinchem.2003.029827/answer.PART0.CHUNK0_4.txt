1. The book "Organic Chemistry Principles and Industrial Practice" might not have direct relevance to laboratory medicine, but it is appreciated by those interested in practical organic chemistry and product synthesis. It tells the story behind the development of industrial processes based on various organic chemical reactions, which could be beneficial for understanding the chemistry behind certain medical applications or products used in laboratory medicine.

2. "Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine" has been a standard textbook in internal medicine for over four decades, offering authoritative descriptions on disease diagnosis and management, making it a valuable resource for anyone involved in laboratory medicine.

3. The "Harrisons Manual of Medicine" is a condensed version of the larger Principles book, weighing only 1.25 pounds, making it more convenient for daily use by interns in managing their tasks. It focuses on diseases, providing quick access to treatment and diagnosis protocols for common medical problems, which is highly useful in teaching and consultation for laboratory medicine.

4. The process of installing the PDA version of the manual requires internet activation, which could pose issues on networks with proxy servers and firewalls. Additionally, the absence of charts and tables in the PDA version may lead to a loss of clarity compared to the print version.

5. Reading and navigating material on a PDA is considered more difficult than reading a physical book, suggesting potential limitations in terms of user experience and accessibility when using digital formats for detailed medical information.
