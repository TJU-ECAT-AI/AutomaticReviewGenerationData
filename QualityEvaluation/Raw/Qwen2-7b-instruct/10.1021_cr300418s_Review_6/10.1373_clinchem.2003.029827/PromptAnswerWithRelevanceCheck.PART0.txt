[1] "Although its interest for laboratory medicine is marginal, those with an interest in practical organic chemistry and the synthesis of many practical products will appreciate this book."
[2] "Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine (McGraw-Hill, New York, 2001) has been a standard textbook in internal medicine for more than four decades."
[3] "The current edition is a hefty 8.5-pound book with authoritative descriptions on the diagnosis and management of diseases and is an excellent reference for anyone in laboratory medicine."
[4] "Harrisons Manual of Medicine, at 1.25 pounds, condenses Principles into a more convenient form."
[5] "Both are used by interns to help them through daily activities."
[6] "Harrisons focuses on diseases, whereas the Washington Manual focuses on patient management."

1. The book "Organic Chemistry Principles and Industrial Practice" might not have direct relevance to laboratory medicine, but it is appreciated by those interested in practical organic chemistry and product synthesis. It tells the story behind the development of industrial processes based on various organic chemical reactions, which could be beneficial for understanding the chemistry behind certain medical applications or products used in laboratory medicine.

2. "Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine" has been a standard textbook in internal medicine for over four decades, offering authoritative descriptions on disease diagnosis and management, making it a valuable resource for anyone involved in laboratory medicine.

3. The "Harrisons Manual of Medicine" is a condensed version of the larger Principles book, weighing only 1.25 pounds, making it more convenient for daily use by interns in managing their tasks. It focuses on diseases, providing quick access to treatment and diagnosis protocols for common medical problems, which is highly useful in teaching and consultation for laboratory medicine.

4. The process of installing the PDA version of the manual requires internet activation, which could pose issues on networks with proxy servers and firewalls. Additionally, the absence of charts and tables in the PDA version may lead to a loss of clarity compared to the print version.

5. Reading and navigating material on a PDA is considered more difficult than reading a physical book, suggesting potential limitations in terms of user experience and accessibility when using digital formats for detailed medical information.

1. 对于实验室医学而言，这本书的直接兴趣可能有限，但对于有兴趣于实用有机化学和多种实际产品合成的人来说，它非常有价值。这本书讲述了基于各种有机化学反应的工业过程发展背后的故事，这可能有助于理解某些医疗应用或实验室医学中使用的产物的化学原理。

2. “内部医学原理哈里森”已经是一个标准的内科学教科书超过四十年，提供了疾病诊断和管理的权威描述，这使得它成为任何涉及实验室医学的人的重要资源。

3. “哈里森手册医学”是“原则”一书的精简版，重量只有1.25磅，使它在日常使用中更加方便，特别是对于实习生来说，他们需要帮助处理每日任务。它专注于疾病，提供快速访问常见医疗问题的治疗和诊断协议，这对于实验室医学的教学和咨询非常有用。

4. 将手册安装到PDA设备的过程需要互联网激活，这可能会在网络存在代理服务器和防火墙的情况下带来问题。此外，在PDA版本中缺少图表和表格可能导致与印刷版相比清晰度降低。

5. 在PDA上阅读和导航材料被认为比阅读实体书更困难，暗示在使用数字格式获取详细医疗信息时可能存在体验和可访问性方面的限制。
