<p>The difficulty in obtaining accurate property predictions for transition metal oxides from DFT calculations has been recognized for some time.</p>
<p>Despite attempts to use hybrid functionals and dynamical mean-field theory to treat the problem, DFT with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals remains an economical choice, and therefore, corrections directed at specific drawbacks of the method are introduced.</p>
<p>The value of Ueff is element-specific, and at least one study has suggested that it is transferable between different oxidation states of a given element.</p>
<p>We note, however, that the value of Ueff determined by Morgan and Watson overestimates the enthalpy change for reaction 2 by 17 kJ/mol.</p>
<p>By contrast, Scanlon et al. suggested Ueff = 4.0 eV based on a comparison of the computed electronic spectra with the experimental ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data.</p>
<p>Castleton et al. optimized the value of Ueff for electronic spectra and structure and recommended Ueff = 5.5 eV for GGA+U, conceding it as a compromise between several properties.</p>
<p>The single exception to the trend in lattice parameters with Ueff is MoO3, for which the lattice parameters a and b generally decrease with increasing values of Ueff and the parameter c increases.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we decided against manually freezing the lattice parameters. We consider that full optimization is more appropriate because, during calculations of reaction or adsorption energies, as a rule, the oxide atoms are fully relaxed.</p>

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation through accurate modeling of the electronic structure and energy landscapes of these materials. The key considerations involve selecting appropriate functionals (such as GGA) and implementing corrections like the DFT+U method to account for the correlated nature of d and f electrons, which are crucial for the catalytic properties of these materials. Challenges include finding the optimal value of Ueff for each element and oxidation state, which can vary significantly, leading to large errors in predicted reaction energies. Potential benefits include the ability to screen and design new catalysts efficiently, albeit with the understanding that the choice of Ueff must be tailored to each specific application to minimize errors and improve predictive accuracy. Efficiency gains come from the computational economy of DFT, which allows for the rapid screening of a large number of materials and conditions. However, the exploration of new catalytic materials requires careful consideration of the limitations and uncertainties associated with the choice of Ueff and the adequacy of the employed theoretical framework.

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT），通过准确模拟这些材料的电子结构和能量图景，增强了我们对掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活中的催化活性的理解。关键考虑因素包括选择合适的函数（如GGA）以及实施纠正，如DFT+U方法，以应对d和f电子的关联性质，这对这些材料的催化性质至关重要。挑战包括找到每个元素和氧化态的最优Ueff值，这些值可以显著不同，导致预测反应能的巨大误差。潜在的好处包括能够高效筛选和设计新的催化剂，尽管需要仔细考虑Ueff的选择以最小化误差并提高预测准确性。效率提升来自DFT的计算经济性，这允许快速筛选大量材料和条件。然而，探索新的催化材料需要仔细考虑与所采用理论框架的局限性和不确定性相关的Ueff选择的有效性。
