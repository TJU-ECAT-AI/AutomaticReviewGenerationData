[1] "Density functional theory (DFT), transition-state theory (TST), and hybrid DFT/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations are reported on the carbon monoxide reaction."
[2] "Using DFT data for a model compound, TST rate calculations at room temperature are carried out which give fair agreement with experiment, and suggest a highly non-adiabatic nature to the reaction."
[3] "QM/MM calculations on the whole protein are reported, which are in qualitative agreement with the gas-phase model results, but suggest that protein matrix effects on the reaction rate may be important."

1. Computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT), transition-state theory (TST), and hybrid DFT/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) are used to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These methods provide insights into the reaction mechanisms, energetics, and pathways involved in the activation process. They allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials and the optimization of existing ones by providing detailed information about the interactions between the catalyst and the reactants.

2. DFT calculations on model compounds can predict the reaction rates at room temperature, showing good agreement with experimental data and suggesting that the reactions are highly non-adiabatic. This means that the probability of spin-flip at the minimal energy crossing point (MECP) is very low, indicating that the reaction involves significant non-adiabatic effects.

3. QM/MM calculations on the whole protein structure provide qualitative agreement with the gas-phase model results, highlighting the importance of the protein matrix in influencing the reaction rate. These calculations suggest that the protein environment can modulate the reaction pathway and affect the energetics of the reaction, potentially leading to different reaction rates for different protein conformations or substates.

1. 计算方法，如密度泛函理论（DFT）、过渡态理论（TST）和混合DFT/分子力学（QM/MM），用于预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活过程中的催化活性。这些方法提供了反应机制、能量和路径的见解，并允许探索新的催化材料和优化现有的材料，通过提供关于催化剂与反应物之间相互作用的详细信息。

2. 对模型化合物进行的DFT计算可以预测室温下的反应速率，显示出与实验数据的良好一致性，并表明反应具有高度非绝热性。这意味着在最小能量交叉点（MECP）处的自旋翻转概率非常低，表明反应涉及显著的非绝热效应。

3. 对整个蛋白质结构的QM/MM计算与气相模型结果保持定性的良好一致性，强调了蛋白质环境在影响反应速率方面的重要性。这些计算表明，蛋白质环境可以调节反应途径并影响反应的能垒，可能导致不同蛋白质构象或亚状态的不同的反应速率。
