<p>However, non-adiabatic effects are clearly important also. This is most clear from our study of spin-forbidden addition of carbon monoxide to triplet iron tetracarbonyl.11 This reaction has been studied experimentally in the gas-phase, and found to proceed about five hundred times slower than the gas-collision rate, in contrast to the spin-allowed related CO addition to iron tricarbonyl, which is nearly as fast as the collisional rate. As well as locating the MECP between singlet and triplet surfaces, we used a non-adiabatic version of transition state theory to calculate the gas-phase rate coefficient for the first of these reactions.11 We found that roughly half of the decrease in rate coefficient is due to the presence of a very low energy barrier introduced by the surface crossing, with the MECP lying less than 1 kcal mol−1 above the separated reactants. However, the remainder of the rate reduction was due to inefficient surface crossing from one diabatic state to another at the MECP. Clearly, non-adiabatic behaviour can have a measurable effect on the rate of reaction in spin-forbidden processes involving transition metal compounds.</p>

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the underlying mechanisms. They allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials with greater efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional experimental methods. Key considerations include the choice of functional in DFT calculations, the adequacy of the basis set, and the inclusion of dispersion corrections. Challenges involve the complexity of modeling multi-component systems and the computational resources required for extensive simulations. Potential benefits include the ability to screen a large number of catalyst candidates and optimize their performance before synthesis, potentially leading to the discovery of novel, efficient catalysts.

2. In the context of the myoglobin CO ligand recombination reaction, non-adiabatic effects play a crucial role. The reaction involves a change in spin state, making it spin-forbidden. By calculating the potential energy surfaces and using non-adiabatic transition state theory, researchers can determine the intrinsic barrier to the reaction, quantify the non-adiabatic behavior, and estimate the rate coefficient. This approach reveals that the non-adiabatic nature of the reaction contributes significantly to the rate reduction compared to an adiabatic process. The probability for spin-flip at the MECP is estimated to be less than 1%, indicating that the reaction pathway is highly diabatic. The findings support the importance of considering non-adiabatic effects in understanding and predicting the kinetics of spin-forbidden reactions in biological systems.

[1] "As an archetypal system in biophysics, there has naturally been a vast amount of previous computational and theoretical work on recombination. On the computational, electronic structure side, early work by several groups used systems such as the small model of Fig. 1, and addressed aspects such as the structure and electronic structure of carbonmonoxy- and oxy-myoglobin,2224 as well as the nature of the exited states and surfaces involved in photodissociation.2527"
[2] "Also in the last years, a number of hybrid QM/MM calculations have appeared, in which all the myoglobin atoms, not just the haem system, are included, and focussing on the geometry and hydrogen bonding in various adducts,3841 as well as on vibrational frequencies and NMR shifts.42,43"
[3] "Our results for the optimised geometries are rather similar to those described elsewhere.39,40 For the carbonmonoxy- complex, as shown in Fig. 5, the CO ligand is almost orthogonal to the porphyrin plane, with an FeCO angle of 169, and NFeC angles all close to 90. The FeC and FeN distances are similar to those found both in model systems and in QM/MM calculations."
[4] "In any case, as pointed out by Sigfridsson and Ryde,40 QM/MM energetics need to be treated with caution, as small changes in the system setup can have quite a strong effect on computed total energies. Experimental energies are often in fact heavily dependent on a model to convert observed rates or equilibria into energies. Also, the present QM/MM results are only preliminary,and considerably more information is needed on the effect of considering the other tautomer of the distal histidine, other protein substates, etc. It may also be desirable to consider other QM methods."
