[1] "As an archetypal system in biophysics, there has naturally been a vast amount of previous computational and theoretical work on recombination. On the computational, electronic structure side, early work by several groups used systems such as the small model of Fig. 1, and addressed aspects such as the structure and electronic structure of carbonmonoxy- and oxy-myoglobin,2224 as well as the nature of the exited states and surfaces involved in photodissociation.2527"
[2] "Also in the last years, a number of hybrid QM/MM calculations have appeared, in which all the myoglobin atoms, not just the haem system, are included, and focussing on the geometry and hydrogen bonding in various adducts,3841 as well as on vibrational frequencies and NMR shifts.42,43"
[3] "Our results for the optimised geometries are rather similar to those described elsewhere.39,40 For the carbonmonoxy- complex, as shown in Fig. 5, the CO ligand is almost orthogonal to the porphyrin plane, with an FeCO angle of 169, and NFeC angles all close to 90. The FeC and FeN distances are similar to those found both in model systems and in QM/MM calculations."
[4] "In any case, as pointed out by Sigfridsson and Ryde,40 QM/MM energetics need to be treated with caution, as small changes in the system setup can have quite a strong effect on computed total energies. Experimental energies are often in fact heavily dependent on a model to convert observed rates or equilibria into energies. Also, the present QM/MM results are only preliminary,and considerably more information is needed on the effect of considering the other tautomer of the distal histidine, other protein substates, etc. It may also be desirable to consider other QM methods."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation in several ways. Firstly, they allow for the modeling of complex systems and the prediction of reaction mechanisms and pathways. Secondly, these methods provide insights into the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of the catalysts, which are crucial for understanding their reactivity. Lastly, they facilitate the exploration of new catalytic materials by allowing researchers to simulate and screen potential candidates. Key considerations include the choice of computational methods, the accuracy of the models, and the efficiency of the calculations. Challenges involve the complexity of the systems being modeled, the computational cost, and the interpretation of results. Potential benefits include the ability to optimize catalysts for specific applications, the acceleration of discovery of new materials, and the reduction of experimental costs and time.
