[1] "The aim of the present work is to contribute to an understanding, at the atomistic level, of the potential energy surfaces and the dynamics associated with recombination of CO."
[2] "Clearly, non-adiabatic behaviour can have a measurable effect on the rate of reaction in spin-forbidden processes involving transition metal compounds."
[3] "This shows that conformations of the protein chain around the haem centre do have an influence on the singlet and quintet potential energy surfaces, and hence on the rate of recombination."
[4] "Using the full QM/MM energies, we calculate a bond energy BDE(FeCO) of 11.7 kcal mol−1 for dissociation of CO to give the quintet deoxy- state, and the singlet state of the deoxy- fragment is computed to lie a further 1.7 kcal mol−1 higher (DE(1,5))."

1. The goal of the current study is to provide insights into the potential energy landscapes and dynamics involved in CO recombination at an atomic scale.
2. Non-adiabatic behavior can significantly impact the reaction rates in spin-forbidden processes that involve transition metal compounds.
3. The variation in protein configurations around the hem center affects the singlet and quintet potential energy surfaces, thereby influencing the recombination rate.
4. By using full QM/MM energies, the researchers calculated a bond energy of 11.7 kcal/mol for CO dissociation into the quintet deoxy state, with the singlet state of the deoxy fragment being 1.7 kcal/mol higher.

1. 现在的研究目标是在原子水平上理解CO重组的势能表面和动力学。
2. 非绝热行为可以在涉及过渡金属化合物的禁戒过程的反应速率中产生可测量的影响。
3. 蛋白质链在血红素中心周围的构象变化会影响单重态和五重态势能表面，从而影响重组速率。
4. 使用全QM/MM能量，研究人员计算出CO解离成五重态脱氧状态的键能为11.7 kcal/mol，脱氧片段的单重态状态比此高出1.7 kcal/mol。
