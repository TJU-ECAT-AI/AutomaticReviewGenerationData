[1] "Density functional theory (DFT), transition-state theory (TST), and hybrid DFT/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations are reported on the carbon monoxide reaction."
[2] "Using DFT data for a model compound, TST rate calculations at room temperature are carried out which give fair agreement with experiment, and suggest a highly non-adiabatic nature to the reaction."
[3] "QM/MM calculations on the whole protein are reported, which are in qualitative agreement with the gas-phase model results, but suggest that protein matrix effects on the reaction rate may be important."

1. Computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT), transition-state theory (TST), and hybrid DFT/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) are utilized to predict and analyze the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These methods offer insights into the reaction mechanisms and provide a means to optimize catalyst performance. They enable researchers to simulate reactions under various conditions, estimate reaction rates, and explore the electronic structure of catalysts and reactants.

2. DFT calculations provide a theoretical framework for understanding the electronic structure and energetics of the catalysts and reactants. Transition-state theory (TST) offers a method to calculate reaction rates by considering the energy barriers and activation energies. Hybrid DFT/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) combines quantum mechanics and classical mechanics to account for the interactions between the quantum system and its environment, offering a more detailed picture of the reaction mechanism and the role of the protein matrix.

3. The combination of these computational methods allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the catalytic process, including the effects of the protein matrix on the reaction rate. This approach can lead to the discovery of new catalytic materials and optimization of existing ones, enhancing the efficiency of alkane activation and other chemical reactions.
