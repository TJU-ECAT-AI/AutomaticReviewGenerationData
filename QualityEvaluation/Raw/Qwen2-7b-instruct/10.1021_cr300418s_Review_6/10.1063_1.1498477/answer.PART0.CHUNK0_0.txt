[1] "DFT calculations indicate nickel atom binding energies are ~1 eV for MgO and ~2.6 eV for TiO2."
[2] "Stronger Ni-support binding probably also accounts for our not seeing desorption of nickel-containing species for Nin /TiO2 -the NiTiO2 binding is much stronger than the CONi binding, so that CO cannot volatilize even small Ni clusters."

2. DFT calculations reveal that nickel atom binding energies on MgO are approximately 1 eV, while those on TiO2 are around 2.6 eV. The stronger binding of nickel to TiO2 explains why we do not observe the desorption of nickel-containing species in Nin /TiO2 -the binding of nickel to titanium dioxide is much stronger than that of carbon monoxide to nickel, preventing even small nickel clusters from volatilizing.

2. DFT计算显示，镁氧化物上的镍原子结合能约为1 eV，而钛氧化物上的结合能约为2.6 eV。镍与钛氧化物之间的更强结合解释了我们为什么在Nin /TiO2中没有观察到镍相关物种的脱附现象——镍与钛氧化物的结合远强于碳氧化合物与镍的结合，因此即使是小镍簇也无法气化。
