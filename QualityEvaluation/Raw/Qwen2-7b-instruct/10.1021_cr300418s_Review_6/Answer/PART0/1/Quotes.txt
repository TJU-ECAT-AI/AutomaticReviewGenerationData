<quote>1. The LDA+U method, introduced by Anisimov and colleagues, aims to explicitly account for the on-site Coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insulators by adding a Hubbard-like interaction term to the standard functional. This term, EHub, is defined as EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is), where EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j. The last term is subtracted to avoid double counting of interactions and uses the total, spin-projected, occupation of the localized manifold, nIs=∑m nm Is.</quote>
         <quote>2. To fully understand how the LDA+U approach operates, the first step is to identify the degrees of freedom that the Hubbard U will act upon and to define the corresponding occupation matrix nmm8 Is. While it is typically straightforward to pinpoint the atomic levels to be treated specially—such as the d electrons in transition metals and the f electrons in the rare earths and actinides series—in a multiatom system, there is no unique or rigorous way to define the occupation of localized atomic levels. Valid alternatives for nmm8 Is include sid projections onto normalized atomic orbitals, siid projections onto Wannier functions when relevant orbitals lead to isolated band manifolds, siiid Mulliken populations, or sivd integrated values in spherical regions around the atoms' angular-momentum-decomposed charge densities.</quote>
         <quote>3. The formal expression of the LDA+U energy functional is derived from model Hamiltonians, notably the Hubbard model, which naturally serves as the theoretical framework for handling strongly correlated materials.</quote>

<quote>1. The LDA+U method, introduced by Anisimov and colleagues, aims to explicitly account for the on-site Coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insulators by adding a Hubbard-like interaction term to the standard functional. This term, EHub, is defined as EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is), where EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j. The last term is subtracted to avoid double counting of interactions and uses the total, spin-projected, occupation of the localized manifold, nIs=∑m nm Is.</quote>
         <quote>2. To fully understand how the LDA+U approach operates, the first step is to identify the degrees of freedom that the Hubbard U will act upon and to define the corresponding occupation matrix nmm8 Is. While it is typically straightforward to pinpoint the atomic levels to be treated specially—such as the d electrons in transition metals and the f electrons in the rare earths and actinides series—in a multiatom system, there is no unique or rigorous way to define the occupation of localized atomic levels. Valid alternatives for nmm8 Is include sid projections onto normalized atomic orbitals, siid projections onto Wannier functions when relevant orbitals lead to isolated band manifolds, siiid Mulliken populations, or sivd integrated values in spherical regions around the atoms' angular-momentum-decomposed charge densities.</quote>
         <quote>3. The formal expression of the LDA+U energy functional is derived from model Hamiltonians, notably the Hubbard model, which naturally serves as the theoretical framework for handling strongly correlated materials.</quote>
