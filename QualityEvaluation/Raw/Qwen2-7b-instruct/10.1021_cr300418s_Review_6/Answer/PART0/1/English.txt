The LDA+U method, introduced by Anisimov and colleagues, aims to explicitly address the on-site Coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insulators by incorporating a Hubbard-like interaction term into the standard functional. This term, denoted as EHub, is formulated as EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is), where EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j.
