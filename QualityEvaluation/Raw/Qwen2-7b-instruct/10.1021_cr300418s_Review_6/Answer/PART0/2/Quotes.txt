          [3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
          [4] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
          [5] "In view of this situation, we felt there was a need for a collection of monographs, each one of which would deal at an advanced level with a selected topic, so as to build a catalysis"

[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) has been extensively analyzed in solid state physics."
          [2] "Improved functionals from the meta-generalized-gradient approximation family such as the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria1 TPSS functional have been shown to predict structural properties for instance, lattice constants and bulk moduli of better quality than LSDA and GGA,24 while energy band gaps obtained as Kohn-Sham band energy differences with these functionals fail to reproduce experimental gaps."
          [3] "Hybrid functionals which include a portion of Hartree-Fock exchange have been successfully applied in the calculation of thermochemical properties of molecules, in addition to yielding good structural properties."
          [4] "The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE hybrid functional12,13 originated as an alternative approach that can be efficiently applied to solids."
          [5] "We have recently shown that HSE gives improved lattice constants and energy band gaps compared to traditional functionals which do not include Hartree-Fock exchange using a set of 40 semiconductors SC/40."

[1] "Computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), have revolutionized the study of molecular systems by providing a powerful tool for predicting the electronic structure and properties of materials."
          [2] "These methods enable the exploration of the electronic configurations of complex systems, which is crucial for understanding their behavior and function."
          [3] "Cluster models are particularly useful for simulating the local environment around active sites on catalyst surfaces, allowing for detailed insights into the mechanisms of catalytic reactions."
          [4] "In the context of alkane activation, computational studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of dopants in oxide catalysts and how they influence the reactivity of the surface."
          [5] "By employing DFT calculations, researchers can accurately model the adsorption of alkane molecules and the interactions with dopants, leading to a better understanding of the catalytic pathways involved."
          [6] "Key considerations in using computational methods for catalysis research include the choice of basis set, the level of theory, and the convergence criteria for electronic structure calculations."
          [7] "Efficiency in these studies is often improved through the use of hybrid functionals and generalized gradient approximations, which balance accuracy and computational cost."
          [8] "Potential benefits of using DFT and cluster models in catalysis research include the prediction of novel catalyst designs, optimization of existing catalysts, and the discovery of new reactivity mechanisms."
