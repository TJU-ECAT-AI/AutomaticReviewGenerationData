          [1] "The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE screened Coulomb hybrid density functional for the calcu- lation of spin-orbit SO splittings and energy band gaps."
          [2] "We have employed a set of 23 semiconductors with available experimental data, including group IV elements, and group III-V, II-VI, and IB-VII compounds."
          [3] "HSE errors are similar to those obtained previously without including SO in the calculation and using a weighted average of the SO split bands for the reference value."
          [4] "All calculations were carried out considering a diamond crystal structure for group IV elements and a zinc-blende crystal structure for all compounds, except AgCl and AgBr that were taken in the rocksalt structure."
          [5] "Band gaps and SO splittings were obtained as Kohn-Sham band energy differences."
          [6] "Our HSE SO splittings are in close agreement with previous LDA calculations."
          [7] "Considering these results and previous assessments of HSE for lattice constants and energy band gaps in semiconductors,4,20 and structural and thermochemical properties of molecules,13 the HSE functional provides a useful tool for practical applications in both molecular and extended systems."

          The computational methods, particularly the density functional theory (DFT) and the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) screened Coulomb hybrid density functional, are instrumental in predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These methods facilitate the exploration of new catalytic materials, offering insights into the electronic structure and chemical behavior of catalysts. Key aspects include the use of advanced functionals, the consideration of spin-orbit coupling, and the optimization of lattice parameters. Challenges involve computational demands and the extrapolation of theoretical predictions to real-world conditions. Potential benefits encompass enhanced understanding of catalytic mechanisms, identification of optimal materials, and cost reduction through theoretical predictions rather than experimental trials.

          [1] "Density functional theory (DFT) has been extensively analyzed in solid state physics."
          [2] "Improved functionals from the meta-generalized-gradient approximation family such as the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria1 TPSS functional have been shown to predict structural properties for instance, lattice constants and bulk moduli of better quality than LSDA and GGA,24 while energy band gaps obtained as Kohn-Sham band energy differences with these functionals fail to reproduce experimental gaps."
          [3] "Hybrid functionals which include a portion of Hartree-Fock exchange have been successfully applied in the calculation of thermochemical properties of molecules, in addition to yielding good structural properties."
          [4] "The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE hybrid functional12,13 originated as an alternative approach that can be efficiently applied to solids."
          [5] "We have recently shown that HSE gives improved lattice constants and energy band gaps compared to traditional functionals which do not include Hartree-Fock exchange using a set of 40 semiconductors SC/40."

          Density functional theory (DFT) has been thoroughly examined in the field of solid state physics, and advanced functionals within the meta-generalized-gradient approximation family, such as the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) functional, have been demonstrated to yield higher-quality predictions for structural properties, like lattice constants and bulk moduli, compared to local spin density approximation (LSDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). However, these functionals may not accurately reproduce experimental energy band gaps when calculated as Kohn-Sham band energy differences. Hybrid functionals, which incorporate a part of Hartree-Fock exchange, have been effectively utilized for calculating the thermodynamic properties of molecules, alongside producing favorable structural properties. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional emerged as an alternative methodology that can be efficiently employed in solid systems. We have recently established that the HSE functional outperforms conventional functionals lacking Hartree-Fock exchange in terms of lattice constants and energy band gaps, using a set of 40 semiconductor materials.

          在固态物理学领域，密度泛函理论（DFT）已被全面研究，元广义梯度逼近家族中的高级功能，如Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria（TPSS）功能，被证明在预测结构性质，如晶格常数和体积模量方面比局部自旋密度近似（LSDA）和广义梯度逼近（GGA）提供更好的质量。然而，当作为Kohn-Sham能带能量差异计算时，这些功能可能无法准确重现实验能带间隙。混合功能通过引入部分哈特里-福克交换，已被成功应用于分子的热力学性质计算，同时产生有利的结构性质。Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof（HSE）混合功能作为另一种在固体体系中可以有效应用的方法出现。我们最近的研究表明，HSE功能在晶格常数和能带间隙方面优于不包含哈特里-福克交换的传统功能，使用一组40个半导体材料。
