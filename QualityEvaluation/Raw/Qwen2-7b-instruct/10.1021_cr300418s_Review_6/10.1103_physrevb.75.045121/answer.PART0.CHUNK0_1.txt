<p>First, we report periodic density functional theory DFT calculations for CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof PBE0 and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE hybrid functionals that include nonlocal Fock exchange. We study structural, electronic, and magnetic ground state properties.</p>
<p>Second, we calculate atomization energies, heats of formation, and the reduction energy of 2CeO2Ce2O3+1/2O2. The latter is underestimated by 0.40.9 eV with respect to available experimental data at room temperature.</p>
<p>Third, we find that the hybrid functionals yield equilibrium volumes in quantitative agreement with experiment, representing a pronounced improvement over the LDA and PBE functionals.</p>
<p>Fourth, the HSE functional gives the most balanced description of the electronic properties, with fundamental band gaps and the position of the 4f states being close to experimental values.</p>
<p>Fifth, the hybrid functionals do not appear to provide a clear-cut improvement over the standard PBE functional for the prediction of thermodynamic properties, although comparison with experiments is rather difficult.</p>
