[1] "The four volumes on physical chemistry by Metiu are impressive, particularly Thermodynamics and Quantum Mechanics."
[2] "The texts may be used with or without the math software, but teaching will be most effective if workbooks are used."
[3] "The bottom line is that the set of four volumes is a must-have, either as a novel resource or invaluable classroom tool."

The integration of Mathematica and Mathcad workbooks into the four texts by Horia Metiu enhances the teaching and learning experience in undergraduate physical chemistry courses. These computational tools allow for more accurate and practical calculations, providing students with hands-on experience and deeper understanding of complex concepts. The workbooks embedded on the accompanying CDs offer a wealth of examples, exercises, and problems that facilitate the removal of mathematical simplifications and approximations typically found in conventional texts. This approach enables learners to tackle real-world problems with greater precision and insight. Therefore, the inclusion of these workbooks makes the physical chemistry texts by Horia Metiu highly valuable resources for educators and students alike.
