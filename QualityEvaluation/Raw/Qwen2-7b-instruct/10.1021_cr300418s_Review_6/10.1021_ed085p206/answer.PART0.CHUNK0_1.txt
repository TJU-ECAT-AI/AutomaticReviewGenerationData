[1] "The section on NMR is of particular note because most chemists are familiar with this technique and accurate calculations are possible with less effort."
[2] "Symmetry is not covered, because, in the words of the author, to do it right would take too much time and, in addition, doing it briefly leads to a presentation devoid of content."
[3] "The two-semester physical chemistry sequence at Rutgers covers the topics of quantum chemistry and spectroscopy in the first semester; thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and kinetics in the second."

The inclusion of computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhances the ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing more accurate and efficient computational tools. These methods allow for the exploration of new catalytic materials by simulating reactions under various conditions, predicting product yields, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Key considerations involve the choice of appropriate computational techniques, ensuring sufficient accuracy, and the balance between computational cost and predictive power. Challenges include the need for high-quality input parameters, the complexity of modeling multi-component systems, and the interpretation of results within the context of real-world catalytic processes. Potential benefits include the acceleration of the discovery of new catalysts, optimization of existing catalysts, and the reduction of experimental costs through virtual screening. However, the limitations of these approaches, such as the simplifications made in modeling and the lack of consideration for certain aspects like symmetry, must be acknowledged.
