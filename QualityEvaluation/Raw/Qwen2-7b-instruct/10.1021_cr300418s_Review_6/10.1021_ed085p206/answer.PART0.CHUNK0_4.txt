[1] "The author uses the symbol \(\hbar\) for the Planck constant and the symbol \(\Omega\) for the photon frequency in both Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics (Energy Photon = \(\Omega\))."
[2] "In Chapter 9 of Quantum Mechanics, he introduces the old Planck constant \(h\), the old frequency \(v\), and the latter's mathematical relationship to \(\Omega\)."
[3] "In Chapter 21, the old constant and frequency are used in the treatment of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Electron Spin Resonance."
[4] "The author reveals for the first time that \(\Omega\) is called the angular frequency."

Answer: These documents discuss the use of computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, in predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. However, there are no direct references to these methods within the provided literature. The focus is on the author's integration of Mathematica and Mathcad workbooks into physical chemistry texts, including volumes on thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, kinetics, and quantum mechanics. The computational tools could potentially enhance the study of catalysis through numerical simulations and calculations, but the specific details of their application in this context are not provided in the document.

答案：这些文档讨论了在烷烃活化中，掺杂氧化物催化剂的催化活性预测、分析和理解过程中，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型的使用。然而，在提供的文献中没有直接提及这些方法。相反，文献的重点是作者将Mathematica和Mathcad工作簿整合到物理化学教科书中，包括热力学、统计力学、动力学和量子力学等主题。计算工具可能通过数值模拟和计算增强催化研究，但它们在此上下文中的具体应用细节未在文档中提供。
