The document discusses an erratum in a previously published paper on hybrid functionals based on a screened Coulomb potential. It notes that the screening parameter quoted in the paper was not the one used in the calculations. To reproduce the results, two values are required: 0.15/20.106 for Hartree-Fock and 0.1521/3 for the PBE part. This erratum affects all of the PBEh and HSE calculations published to date, but the validity of the published HSE values remains unaffected. The document also mentions that optimization of a single value of α for a functional similar to the one discussed in this paper will be presented elsewhere.

文档讨论了一个先前发表的关于屏蔽库仑势的混合功能的论文中的更正。它指出，论文中引用的屏蔽参数并非实际使用的参数。为了重现结果，需要两个值：0.15/20.106用于哈特里-福克方法，0.1521/3用于PBE部分。这个更正影响了到目前为止所有发布的PBEh和HSE计算，但已发布的HSE值的有效性不受影响。文档还提到，对于类似于本文讨论的功能的α值的优化将在其他地方呈现。
