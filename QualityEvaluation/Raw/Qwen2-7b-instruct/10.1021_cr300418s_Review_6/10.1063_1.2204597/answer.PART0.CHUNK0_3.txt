1. The screening parameter specified as 0.15 in the paper did not match the actual value used in the computational code. To replicate the findings, two specific values were required: 0.15/20.106 for Hartree-Fock calculations and 0.1521/3 for the PBE part.
2. Optimization of a single screening parameter for functionals similar to those discussed in the paper will be detailed in a separate publication.

1. 论文中提到的筛选参数为0.15，并未在计算代码中实际使用。为了重现结果，需要两个特定值：对于哈特里-福克计算，为0.15/20.106；对于PBE部分，为0.1521/3。
2. 对于类似于本文讨论的功能的单个筛选参数的优化将在另一篇出版物中详细说明。
