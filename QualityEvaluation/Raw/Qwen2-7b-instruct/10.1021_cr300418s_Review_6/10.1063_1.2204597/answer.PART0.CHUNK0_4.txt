The screening parameter stated in the document as =0.15 was not utilized in the actual computations. To replicate the findings, two distinct values are required: =0.15/20.106 for Hartree-Fock calculations and =0.1521/3 0.189 for the PBE component. It is also mentioned that an optimization process for a single value related to the functional discussed in the paper will be detailed in future work.

文档中提到的屏蔽参数=0.15并未在实际计算中使用。为了重现结果，需要两个不同的值：对于哈特里-福克计算，为=0.15/20.106；对于PBE部分，为=0.1521/3 0.189。还指出，关于论文中讨论的功能的单个值优化过程将在后续工作中详细说明。
