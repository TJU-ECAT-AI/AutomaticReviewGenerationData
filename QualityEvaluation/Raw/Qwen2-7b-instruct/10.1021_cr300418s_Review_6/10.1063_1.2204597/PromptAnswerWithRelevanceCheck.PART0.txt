The document discusses an erratum in a previously published paper on hybrid functionals based on a screened Coulomb potential. It notes that the screening parameter quoted in the paper was not the one used in the calculations. To reproduce the results, two values are required: 0.15/20.106 for Hartree-Fock and 0.1521/3 for the PBE part. This erratum affects all of the PBEh and HSE calculations published to date, but the validity of the published HSE values remains unaffected. The document also mentions that optimization of a single value of α for a functional similar to the one discussed in this paper will be presented elsewhere.

文档讨论了一个先前发表的关于屏蔽库仑势的混合功能的论文中的更正。它指出，论文中引用的屏蔽参数并非实际使用的参数。为了重现结果，需要两个值：0.15/20.106用于哈特里-福克方法，0.1521/3用于PBE部分。这个更正影响了到目前为止所有发布的PBEh和HSE计算，但已发布的HSE值的有效性不受影响。文档还提到，对于类似于本文讨论的功能的α值的优化将在其他地方呈现。

1. To reproduce the results presented in the paper, two specific values are required: 0.15/20.106 for Hartree-Fock calculations and 0.1521/3 for the PBE part. Despite the initial error, all published HSE values remain valid and reproducible using these corrected values. Further details on optimizing a single value for the functional discussed will be provided in another publication.

1. 为了重现论文中呈现的结果，需要两个特定值：对于哈特里-福克计算，值为0.15/20.106；对于PBE部分，值为0.1521/3。尽管存在初始错误，所有已发布的HSE值仍然有效且可重复使用这些修正后的值。关于该功能讨论的单个值优化的进一步细节将在另一篇出版物中提供。

2. The paper acknowledges an error in the screening parameter quoted, which was not utilized in the actual computations. It clarifies that for accurate reproduction of the results, two distinct values should be applied: 0.15/20.106 for Hartree-Fock calculations and 0.1521/3 for the PBE component. Despite this correction, all published HSE results remain unaffected and reproducible using these specified values. The authors emphasize the importance of using the correct values for future studies involving the functional described in the paper.

2. 论文承认引用的屏蔽参数与实际计算中使用的参数不一致。它明确指出，为了准确复制结果，应应用两个不同的值：对于哈特里-福克计算，值为0.15/20.106；对于PBE组件，值为0.1521/3。尽管如此，所有已发布的HSE结果仍然不受影响且可以使用这些指定的值进行可重复性研究。作者强调，在涉及论文中描述的功能的未来研究中使用正确值的重要性。

The computational methods discussed in the literature, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation through precise calculations of electronic structures and properties. Key considerations include the accuracy of the functional parameters, such as the screening parameter, which affects the reliability of predictions. Challenges involve the computational cost and the need for efficient algorithms to handle large systems. Potential benefits include the ability to explore new catalytic materials and optimize existing ones by simulating their behavior under various conditions.

However, the document does not provide specific details on how computational methods enhance the prediction, analysis, or understanding of the catalytic activity in alkane activation. It also does not discuss the challenges or potential benefits in terms of accuracy, efficiency, or exploration of new catalytic materials. The focus is on correcting an error in the screening parameter used in hybrid functionals, which impacts the reproduction of results for published calculations.

文献中讨论的计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过精确计算电子结构和性质，增强了我们对掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃活化中的催化活性的预测、分析和理解能力。关键考虑因素包括功能参数的准确性，如屏蔽参数，这影响预测的可靠性。挑战包括计算成本和需要高效的算法来处理大型系统。潜在的好处包括通过模拟在不同条件下的行为来探索新材料和优化现有材料的能力。

然而，该文档并未提供关于如何通过计算方法增强对烷烃活化中催化活性的预测、分析或理解的具体细节。它也没有讨论准确性、效率或新材料探索方面的挑战或潜在好处。重点是纠正使用混合功能的错误屏蔽参数，这会影响已发表计算结果的再现性。

1. The screening parameter specified as 0.15 in the paper did not match the actual value used in the computational code. To replicate the findings, two specific values were required: 0.15/20.106 for Hartree-Fock calculations and 0.1521/3 for the PBE part.
