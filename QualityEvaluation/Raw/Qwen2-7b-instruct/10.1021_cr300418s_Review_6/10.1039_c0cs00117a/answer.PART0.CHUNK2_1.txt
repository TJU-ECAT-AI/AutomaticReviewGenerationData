[1] "The complex spectroscopy encountered by dosing CO on a real Pd supported nanoparticles catalysts."
[2] "The high ymax spectrum presents a tail at the low frequency side, which progressively becomes relatively more relevant upon lowering y."
[3] "The value measured at PCO = 50 Torr, n(CO) = 1994 cm−1, exactly corresponds to the frequency observed on single crystal Pd(100) faces at ymax."
[4] "The high frequency component can gain intensity due to a coupling interaction within CO adlayers, because of a characteristic transfer of intensity occurring from the band due to lower frequency species (linear CO on defects) to that of its high-frequency counterpart (CO on well defined Pd faces)."
[5] "However, it is well known that the 1925–1905 cm−1 interval lies in the frequency frontier between the region of three- and two-fold bridged carbonyls, and that the bands falling there have been assigned to both species moving from author to author of the quoted literature."
[6] "As for the component at 1694 cm−1, which is an extremely low frequency and never observed on single crystals, it has been interpreted as due to a fraction of three-fold bridged carbonyls interacting through the O termination with the Al3+ acid sites of the SiO2Al2O3 support."

1. The complex spectroscopy encountered by dosing CO on a real Pd supported nanoparticles catalysts is due to the interaction of CO with various adsorption sites on the catalyst surface.
2. The tail at the low frequency side of the high ymax spectrum becomes increasingly significant as the coverage of CO on the catalyst surface decreases.
3. The frequency at which CO adsorbs on Pd(100) faces matches the frequency observed on single crystal Pd(100) faces at the maximum coverage level (ymax).
4. The high frequency component of the IR spectrum increases in intensity due to a coupling interaction within CO adlayers, transferring intensity from the lower frequency species (linear CO on defects) to the higher frequency species (CO on well defined Pd faces).
5. The 1925–1905 cm−1 interval is a frequency region where both three-fold and two-fold bridged carbonyls are observed, reflecting the complexity of the surface chemistry.
6. The 1694 cm−1 band, a low frequency band not observed on single crystals, is attributed to three-fold bridged carbonyls interacting with the Al3+ acid sites of the support through their O termination.

1. 在真实Pd支持纳米粒子催化剂上施加CO时遇到的复杂光谱是由CO与催化剂表面各种吸附位点的相互作用引起的。
2. 高ymax光谱中的低频尾部随着CO在催化剂表面覆盖率的降低而变得越来越重要。
3. 在单晶Pd(100)面上达到最大覆盖度（ymax）时，CO在Pd(100)面的吸附频率与单晶Pd(100)面上观察到的频率相匹配。
4. IR谱中高频成分的强度增加是由于CO吸附层内的耦合相互作用，将从较低频率物种（缺陷上的线性CO）到较高频率物种（定义明确的Pd面上的CO）的强度转移。
5. 1925–1905 cm−1区域是一个三重桥接羰基和二重桥接羰基共存的频率区域，反映了表面化学的复杂性。
6. 1694 cm−1波数的低频带，未在单晶上观察到，被归因于通过其O终端与支持物上的Al3+酸性位点相互作用的三重桥接羰基。
