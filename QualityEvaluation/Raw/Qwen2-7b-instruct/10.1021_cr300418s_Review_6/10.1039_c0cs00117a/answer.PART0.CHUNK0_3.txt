Computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. Accuracy depends on the quality of input parameters, such as the electronic structure of the dopant, the oxide lattice, and the interaction between the dopant and alkane. Efficiency is improved with high-performance computing and optimized algorithms. Exploring new materials is accelerated by computational screening of a large number of candidates. Key considerations involve choosing the right computational method, selecting the appropriate level of theory, and ensuring accuracy in input parameters.
