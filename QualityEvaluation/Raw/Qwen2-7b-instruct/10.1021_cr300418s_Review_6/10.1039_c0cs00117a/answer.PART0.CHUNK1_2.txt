[1] "Inductive and relaxation effects can be proposed: inductive effect is associated with electronic density changes at a given site induced by adsorption at a neighboring site."
[2] "The complexity of the IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on well defined oxide and halides surfaces is well documented by the set of coverage-dependent spectra reported in Fig. 20 (for ZnO,138 a-Cr2O3,334,383,384,389,400 MgCr2O4,10 LaCr2O3,10 TiO2 10,397 and CuCl),390 Fig. 21 (for MgO)14,17,182,389,401404 and Fig. 26a (for NiO).182,405407"
[3] "The evolution of the IR spectra of CO dosed on low surface area NiO crystals as a function of coverage is reported in section 4.3 to allow a direct comparison with the series of spectra obtained dosing NO on the same material (vide infra Fig. 26a)."

1. Inductive effects relate to changes in electronic density at a specific site triggered by adsorption at a nearby site.

2. The complexity of CO adsorption spectroscopy on oxide and halide surfaces is demonstrated through various coverage-dependent spectra.

3. The infrared (IR) spectrum evolution of CO on NiO with increasing coverage is documented in section 4.3, for comparison with NO adsorption on the same material as shown in Fig. 26a.
