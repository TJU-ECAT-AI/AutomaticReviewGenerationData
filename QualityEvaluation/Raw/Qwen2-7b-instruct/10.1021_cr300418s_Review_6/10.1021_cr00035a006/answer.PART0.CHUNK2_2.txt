Computational methods, notably density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. DFT provides insights into the electronic structure and catalytic mechanisms at the atomic level, while cluster models are instrumental in studying the simultaneous interactions of catalysts with multiple reactive species. Key considerations in employing these methods involve selecting appropriate levels of theory, accurately defining input parameters, and validating computational outcomes against experimental data. Challenges include managing computational expenses and interpreting results effectively. The benefits of computational methods encompass increased predictive capabilities, reduced experimental costs, and efficient screening of potential catalysts. This accelerates the discovery of novel catalysts and the optimization of existing ones.
