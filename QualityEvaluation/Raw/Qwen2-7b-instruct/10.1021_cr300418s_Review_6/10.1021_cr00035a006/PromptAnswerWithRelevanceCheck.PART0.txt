1. Zeolite geometry affects acidity through the distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si group, particularly in the T-O-T angles, which are larger in strongly acidic zeolites like ZSM-5 and mordenite compared to less acidic ones like HY.

2. Molecular orbital calculations have been used to study the effect of bond angles and distances on hydroxyl acidity. 

3. A decrease in deprotonation energy with an increase in T-O-T bond angle indicates an increase in acidity. 

4. Similar conclusions were drawn from studying clusters of type (HO)3 Si(0H) N(OH)3, showing the most stable T-O-T angles for protonated and deprotonated forms are 134.2 and 179.3, respectively.

<p>In the case of acid-catalyzed reactions on zeolites, it is claimed that carbocations may be formed on the surface of acid zeolites by protonation of olefins, aromatics, and even alkanes, by protonation and dehydration of alcohols, or by abstraction of hydride ions from saturated molecules.</p>
<p>It was supposed that such carbocations would be the intermediate species in acid-catalyzed reactions of hydrocarbons. Since "free" carbocations were detected in a homogeneous solution of SbF5-HF, one may expect to be able to detect them on the surface of an acidic zeolite.</p>
