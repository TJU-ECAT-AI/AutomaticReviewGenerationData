1. Zeolite geometry affects acidity through the distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si group, particularly in the T-O-T angles, which are larger in strongly acidic zeolites like ZSM-5 and mordenite compared to less acidic ones like HY.

2. Molecular orbital calculations have been used to study the effect of bond angles and distances on hydroxyl acidity. 

3. A decrease in deprotonation energy with an increase in T-O-T bond angle indicates an increase in acidity. 

4. Similar conclusions were drawn from studying clusters of type (HO)3 Si(0H) N(OH)3, showing the most stable T-O-T angles for protonated and deprotonated forms are 134.2 and 179.3, respectively.

1. 离子沸石的几何形状通过Al-OH-Si组分中的距离和键角影响酸性，特别是T-O-T角度，强酸性沸石如ZSM-5和蒙脱石的T-O-T角度比弱酸性沸石如HY大。

2. 分子轨道计算被用来研究键角和距离对羟基酸性的效应。 

3. 随着T-O-T键角的增加，脱质子能降低，表明酸性增加。

4. 对于类型（HO）3 Si(0H) N(OH)3的簇，发现质子化和脱质子化形式的最稳定T-O-T角度分别为134.2和179.3。

<p>In the case of acid-catalyzed reactions on zeolites, it is claimed that carbocations may be formed on the surface of acid zeolites by protonation of olefins, aromatics, and even alkanes, by protonation and dehydration of alcohols, or by abstraction of hydride ions from saturated molecules.</p>
<p>It was supposed that such carbocations would be the intermediate species in acid-catalyzed reactions of hydrocarbons. Since "free" carbocations were detected in a homogeneous solution of SbF5-HF, one may expect to be able to detect them on the surface of an acidic zeolite.</p>
<p>However, most of the attempts have failed318 and the only carbocation positively identified on the amorphous silica-alumina and the HY zeolite is the very stable triphenylcarbenium ion.</p>

1. Besides electronegativity, zeolite geometry also impacts the acidity of zeolites, influencing distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si group. Strongly acidic zeolites like ZSM-5 and mordenite have wider T-O-T angles (137-177 and 143-180 degrees, respectively) compared to less acidic ones (HY, 138-147 degrees).
