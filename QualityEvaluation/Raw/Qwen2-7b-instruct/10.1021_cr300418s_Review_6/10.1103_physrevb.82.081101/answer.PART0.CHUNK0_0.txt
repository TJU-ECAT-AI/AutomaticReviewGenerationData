[1] "The van der Waals vdW attraction is a quantum- mechanical phenomenon with charge fluctuations in one part of an atomic system that are electrodynamically correlated with charge fluctuations in another."
[2] "Methods for accurately calculating the vdW interactions are critical to understanding sparse matter, including bulk solids e.g., layered materials, molecular crystals, and polymers, surface phenomena e.g., adsorption, water overlay- ers, and gas separation and storage, and biostructures e.g., DNA and protein structure."
[3] "The exact density functional contains the vdW forces. Unfortunately, we do not have access to it but approximate versions are abundant."
[4] "Despite its success for describing dispersion in a breadth of systems better than any other non-empirical method, vdW-DF overestimates equilibrium separations4,5,712 and underestimates hydrogen-bond strength.13,14"
[5] "First, we replace Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof revPBE exchange functional18 with PW86,15,16 because revPBE is generally too repulsive near the equilibrium separation,8 and can bind spuriously by exchange alone, although less so than most other local or semilocal functionals."
[6] "The key to the vdW-DF method is the inclusion of a long-range piece of the correlation energy, Ec nln, a fully nonlocal functional of the density n."
[7] "In the first version of vdW-DF,4 the gradient correction was obtained from a gradient expansion24 for the slowly varying electron gas.25,26 More appropriate is a functional that gives accurate energies for molecules, however."
[8] "Thus we use 2.222 times larger exchange gradient coefficient, a value based on agreement between derived17,27,28 and empirical29 criteria a 6% smaller derived value of Ref. 17 only gives a marginal improvement."
[9] "The performance of our energy functional is assessed via comparisons with the accurate S22 reference data set31,32 and PECs Ref. 33 based on QC calculations at the level of coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative triple excitations CCSDT with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit."
[10] "The PECs tend to turn up slightly earlier when approaching the repulsion regime at small separations."
[11] "For duplexes whose large distance asymptote is dominated by dispersion here methane dimer, ethene dimer, and benzene-methane, vdW-DF2 will have weaker attraction in the asymptotic region and smaller C6 coefficients than vdW-DF, which at least for the methane dimer already gives a C6 coefficient close to experiment."
[12] "Overall, the vdW-DF2 binding energies are within 50 meV of the reference except for duplexes 5 and 7. The MAD of binding energy is decreased from 41 to 22 meV 13% to 7.6%."

1. Density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing detailed insights into the electronic structure and reaction pathways. Key considerations involve accuracy, efficiency, and the exploration of new catalytic materials. Challenges include the computational cost of running extensive simulations, the need for high-performance computing resources, and the complexity of modeling heterogeneous surfaces. Benefits include the ability to screen large libraries of potential catalysts, optimize reaction conditions, and gain mechanistic understanding without the need for experimental trials.

2. Computational methods allow for the exploration of a wide range of catalysts, enabling the discovery of new materials with enhanced activity and selectivity. They can predict the formation of intermediates, the stability of transition states, and the overall reaction kinetics, providing a theoretical foundation for experimental design. However, accuracy is crucial, and the choice of computational models must balance computational efficiency with predictive power. Challenges include the representation of surface chemistry, the treatment of adsorbate-surface interactions, and the prediction of reaction rates under realistic conditions. Potential benefits include the reduction of experimental costs, the acceleration of the development cycle for new catalysts, and the ability to tailor catalyst properties for specific applications.
