<p>Despite its success for describing dispersion in a breadth of systems better than any other non-empirical method,7 vdW-DF overestimates equilibrium separations4,5,712 and underestimates hydrogen-bond strength.13,14 In this Rapid Communication, we propose a second ver- sion of the van der Waals density functional vdW-DF2 employing a more accurate semilocal exchange functional PW86 Refs. 15 and 16 and the use of a large-N asymptote gradient correction17 in determining the vdW kernel. By making a full comparison of potential-energy curves PECs with accurate quantum chemistry QC results for 22 molecular duplexes, we show that vdW-DF2 substantially improves i equilibrium separations,ii hydrogen-bond strengths, and iii vdW attractions at intermediate separa- tions longer than the equilibrium ones.</p>
<p>The improvement in iii, found via a full PEC comparison, is most critical for important real-life applications to sparse matter and bio-logical matter where it is impossible for basic structural units to assume the same separations they would have as binary units in vacuo.</p>

The document discusses a second version of the van der Waals density functional, vdW-DF2, which employs a more accurate semilocal exchange functional PW86 and uses a large-N asymptote gradient correction to improve predictions of equilibrium separations, hydrogen-bond strengths, and vdW attractions at intermediate separations. This improvement is crucial for applications involving sparse matter and biological matter where structural units cannot maintain vacuum-like separations.

本文讨论了第二代范德瓦尔斯密度泛函vdW-DF2，它采用更准确的半局部交换函数PW86和使用大型-N渐近梯度修正来改善对平衡距离、氢键强度和中间分离时的范德华吸引力的预测。这种改进对于涉及稀疏物质和生物物质的应用至关重要，在这些应用中，基本结构单元无法保持真空状态下的分离。
