[1] "We propose a second version of the van der Waals density functional of Dion et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,246401 2004, employing a more accurate semilocal exchange functional and the use of a large-N asymptote gradient correction in determining the vdW kernel."
[2] "By making a full comparison of potential-energy curves PECs with accurate quantum chemistry QC results for 22 molecular duplexes, we show that vdW-DF2 substantially improves i equilibrium separations,ii hydrogen-bond strengths, and iii vdW attractions at intermediate separations longer than the equilibrium ones."
[3] "The improvement in iii, found via a full PEC comparison, is most critical for important real-life applications to sparse matter and biological matter where it is impossible for basic structural units to assume the same separations they would have as binary units in vacuo."
[4] "First, we replace Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof revPBE exchange functional with PW86,15,16 because revPBE is generally too repulsive near the equilibrium separation,8 and can bind spuriously by exchange alone, although less so than most other local or semilocal functionals."
[5] "The performance of our energy functional is assessed via comparisons with the accurate S22 reference data set31,32 and PECs Ref. 33 based on QC calculations at the level of coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative triple excitations CCSDT with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit."
[6] "Figure 1 shows a typical PEC for each kind of interaction."
[7] "To make a direct comparison to the QC results, the PECs are calculated at the same geometry of those of the CCSDT PEC calculations33 shown as dashed-dotted lines with circles, where each molecule is kept in its S22 geometry31 and moved along the line defined by the center-of-mass coordinates of two molecules without any rotation."

The study proposes an updated van der Waals density functional, termed vdW-DF2, which utilizes a more precise semilocal exchange functional and a large-N asymptotic gradient correction to determine the van der Waals kernel. This functional significantly enhances the accuracy of predicting equilibrium separations, hydrogen bond strengths, and van der Waals attractions at intermediate distances compared to previous methods. The improvement is particularly crucial for applications involving sparse matter and biological systems where structural units cannot maintain the same separations they would in isolation. The replacement of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (revPBE) exchange functional with the PW86 functional is a key step in achieving this enhanced accuracy. The effectiveness of the vdW-DF2 is demonstrated through comprehensive comparisons with quantum chemical calculations on 22 molecular duplexes, showcasing its superiority in capturing the true nature of intermolecular interactions. Potential-energy curves (PECs) serve as a critical tool for evaluating the functional's performance against high-precision quantum chemical data.

研究提出了一个更新的范德瓦尔斯密度泛函，称为vdW-DF2，它利用更精确的半局部交换泛函和大-N渐近梯度修正来确定范德瓦尔斯核。这种功能性显著提高了预测平衡间距、氢键强度和在较远距离的范德瓦尔斯吸引力的准确性，与先前的方法相比。这种改进对于涉及稀疏物质和生物系统的应用尤为重要，在这些系统中，结构单元无法维持在真空中的相同间距。替换Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof（revPBE）交换泛函为PW86泛函是实现这一高精度的关键步骤。通过与22个分子二聚体的量子化学计算进行全面比较，证明了vdW-DF2的有效性，展示了其在捕获分子间相互作用真实性质方面的优越性。潜在能曲线（PECs）作为评估功能性性能的关键工具，与高精度量子化学数据进行了对比。
