[1] "Methods for accurately calculating the vdW interactions are critical to understanding sparse matter, including bulk solids e.g., layered materials, molecular crystals, and polymers, surface phenomena e.g., adsorption, water overlay- ers, and gas separation and storage, and biostructures e.g., DNA and protein structure."
[2] "First-principles approaches for how vdW can be treated in DFT were first proposed for the asymptotic interaction between fragments."
[3] "Despite its success for describing dispersion in a breadth of systems better than any other non-empirical method,7 vdW-DF overestimates equilibrium separations4,5,712 and underestimates hydrogen-bond strength.13,14"
[4] "First, we replace Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof revPBE exchange functional18 with PW86,15,16 because revPBE is generally too repulsive near the equilibrium separation,8 and can bind spuriously by exchange alone, although less so than most other local or semilocal functionals."
[5] "The performance of our energy functional is assessed via comparisons with the accurate S22 reference data set31,32 and PECs Ref. 33 based on QC calculations at the level of coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative triple excitations CCSDT with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing precise calculations of the electronic structure and energetics involved in the reaction pathways. Key considerations include the accuracy of the exchange-correlation functional, which affects the description of van der Waals (vdW) forces and hydrogen bonding, essential for understanding the interactions in heterogeneous catalysis. Challenges involve the computational cost and the need for benchmark datasets to validate the theoretical predictions against experimental results. Potential benefits include the ability to screen and design new catalyst materials with desired properties, optimizing the catalytic process for efficiency and selectivity. The use of advanced functionals like PW86 in DFT improves the prediction of equilibrium separations and hydrogen bond strengths, reducing discrepancies with quantum chemical calculations and enhancing the reliability of theoretical models in predicting catalytic behavior.
