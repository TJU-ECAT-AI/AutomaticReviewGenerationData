<p>The vdW-DF2 substantially improves i equilibrium separations,ii hydrogen-bond strengths, and iii vdW attractions at intermediate separations longer than the equilibrium ones.</p>
<p>First, we replace Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof revPBE exchange functional with PW86,15,16 because revPBE is generally too repulsive near the equilibrium separation,8 and can bind spuriously by exchange alone, although less so than most other local or semilocal functionals.</p>
<p>The key to the vdW-DF method is the inclusion of a long-range piece of the correlation energy, Ec nln, a fully nonlocal functional of the density n. This piece is evaluated using a plasmon pole approximation for the inverse dielectric function, which satisfies known conservation laws, limits,sum rules, and invariances.4</p>
<p>In the first version of vdW-DF,4 the gradient correction was obtained from a gradient expansion24 for the slowly varying electron gas.25,26 More appropriate is a functional that gives accurate energies for molecules, however. When r and r are each in a separate moleculelike region, with exponentially decaying tails between them, fr and fr can both be large and give key contributions to a vdW attraction.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PW86R functional, selected as the overall exchange functional for different reasons, also follows the large-N behavior for small reduced gradient s values down to 0.1, where it reverts to the form of slowly varying electron-gas limit.</p>
<p>For duplexes whose large distance asymptote is dominated by dispersion here methane dimer, ethene dimer, and benzene-methane, vdW-DF2 will have weaker attraction in the asymptotic region and smaller C6 coefficients than vdW-DF, which at least for the methane dimer already gives a C6 coefficient close to experiment.6 Recently, this prediction was verified in detail for various duplexes.36</p>

The document outlines the development of vdW-DF2, an enhanced version of the van der Waals density functional, aimed at improving predictions of equilibrium separations, hydrogen-bond strengths, and van der Waals attractions. It achieves this through modifications to the exchange functional, notably replacing the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) revPBE exchange functional with the PW86 functional. The inclusion of a large-N asymptotic gradient correction in the determination of the vdW kernel further enhances accuracy. The document also discusses the importance of accurately calculating long-range interactions in various physical contexts, including condensed matter, surface phenomena, and biological systems. It emphasizes the superiority of vdW-DF2 in describing dispersion interactions across a range of molecular systems, particularly in improving hydrogen bond strengths and van der Waals attractions at intermediate separations compared to previous versions of the vdW-DF method. 

In particular, vdW-DF2 shows notable improvements in the description of hydrogen bonded systems, dispersion dominated systems, and mixed systems, as evidenced by a reduction in the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of binding energies. Additionally, vdW-DF2 provides more accurate predictions for extended systems such as graphite interlayer binding energy, metal-organic framework adsorption, and water molecule internal structures. The enhanced accuracy of vdW-DF2 is attributed to its improved treatment of non-local correlations and long-range interactions, leading to better agreement with quantum chemical calculations and experimental data.

文档描述了vdW-DF2的开发，这是van der Waals密度泛函的增强版本，旨在提高预测平衡间距、氢键强度和范德华吸引力的能力。它通过修改交换函数实现这一目标，特别是用PW86功能替换Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof（PBE）revPBE交换功能。在确定vdW核时引入大型-N渐近梯度修正进一步提高了准确性。文档还强调了准确计算远程相互作用在固体物理、表面现象和生物系统中的重要性。它特别强调vdW-DF2在描述各种分子系统的分散作用时的优势，尤其是在改进氢键强度和中间距离上的范德华吸引力方面，与之前的vdW-DF方法相比。

具体而言，vdW-DF2在氢键结合系统、分散主导系统和混合系统中显示出显著改进，这体现在结合能平均绝对偏差（MAD）的减少上。此外，vdW-DF2为石墨层间结合能、金属有机框架吸附、水分子内部结构等扩展系统提供了更准确的预测。vdW-DF2增强的准确性归因于其对非局部相关性和远程相互作用的改进处理，导致与量子化学计算和实验数据的一致性更好。
