This study highlights the significant influence of both the size and support material on the catalytic activity of oxide-supported metal nanoclusters, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene. The research demonstrates that the activity and selectivity of these catalysts are highly dependent on the specific support used, with magnesium oxide (MgO) exhibiting a particularly pronounced effect due to the dynamic formation of a cluster-based nanoassembly during the reaction process. The activity and selectivity towards benzene formation were found to be influenced by the support's ability to interact with the metal clusters, altering their oxidation state, composition, and size. This interplay leads to the emergence of complex, evolving nanostructures that are crucial for enhancing the catalytic performance of the metal clusters. The study further emphasizes the importance of computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, in predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These computational approaches offer several key advantages, including increased accuracy, efficiency in exploring new catalytic materials, and the ability to address the intricate relationships between catalyst structure and activity. The findings underscore the potential of such materials as attractive alternatives to precious metal-based catalysts, particularly for applications requiring high reactivity at lower temperatures.
