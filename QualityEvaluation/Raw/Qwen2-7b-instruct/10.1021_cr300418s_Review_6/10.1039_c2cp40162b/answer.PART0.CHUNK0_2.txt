The study highlights the importance of metal-support interactions in determining the catalytic activity of oxide-supported metal nanoclusters. The research involves the preparation of model catalyst systems with subnanometer cobalt clusters on various metal oxide supports, and the use of advanced techniques such as Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (GIXAS) to investigate the morphology, chemical state, and reactivity of these catalysts during the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene. The findings indicate that the support material, along with the size and oxidation state of the cobalt clusters, significantly influences the catalytic performance. Additionally, the dynamic evolution of nanoassemblies from the subnanometer cobalt clusters during the reaction process is emphasized. The study also underscores the utility of grazing incidence techniques in studying nanoparticle reactions under atmospheric pressure conditions, and the importance of precise control over reaction parameters such as temperature and reactant ratios for achieving optimal catalytic outcomes.
