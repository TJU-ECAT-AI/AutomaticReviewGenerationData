<p>The catalytic activity of oxide-supported metal nanoclusters strongly depends on their size and support.</p>
<p>In this study, the origin of morphology transformation and chemical state changes during the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene was investigated in terms of metal-support interactions.</p>
<p>The most pronounced support effect is observed for MgO, where during the course of the reaction in its activity, composition and size dynamically evolving nanoassembly is formed from subnanometer cobalt clusters.</p>
<p>The high surface sensitivity of grazing incidence techniques, including GISAXS and GIXAS, enables the study of the chemical state and morphology of metal nanoparticles deposited on flat substrates with less than one tenth of monolayer coverage.</p>
<p>GISAXS has been proven to be a very powerful tool to study morphological transformations of nanoparticles under a reactive gas environment under atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>The activity and selectivity of cobalt clusters show strong dependence on the support.</p>
<p>Support effects for the Co/ZnO, Co/TiO2, and Co/Al2O3 systems can be compared up to 300 °C.</p>
<p>At 250 °C, the B1.5 nm assembly formed in the Co/MgO system outperforms Co/Al2O3, Co/TiO2, and Co/ZnO in both activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>Onset of product formation on subnanometer cobalt clusters is observed at 150 °C, demonstrating the capability of sub-nm (oxidized) cobalt clusters to activate O2 at low temperatures.</p>
<p>The straight line shows the temperature profile ramping from 20 to 300 °C, stepwise.</p>
<p>The low light off temperature and observed turnover rates can make such materials attractive alternatives to precious metal based dehydrogenation catalysts, but also for other oxidative processes.</p>
<p>These highly dynamic nanostructures seem to adapt their size and morphology to offer optimal active sites for the reaction.</p>
