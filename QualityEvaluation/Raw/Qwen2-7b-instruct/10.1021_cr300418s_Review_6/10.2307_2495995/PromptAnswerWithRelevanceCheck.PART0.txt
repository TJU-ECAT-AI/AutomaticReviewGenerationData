[1] "The Soviet Russian State is a solid textbook written for the undergraduate course on Soviet politics."
[2] "In contrast with some other recent volumes aimed at the same market, Wesson's combines balanced coverage of most aspects of the system with commendable depth."
[3] "Despite the occasional overgeneralization or dubious assertion of fact, Professor Wesson nevertheless has fundamentally achieved what he set out to do."
[4] "The chapter on "The Party," for example, repeats too much of -the conventional wisdom and pays insufficient attention to the complexity of inter- and intra-organizational relationships (documented,in particular,in the writings of Jerry Hough)."
[5] "Despite the occasional overgeneralization or dubious assertion of fact, Professor Wesson nevertheless has fundamentally achieved what he set out to do."
[6] "He has written the kind of readable textbook, thematically integrated but with much useful illustrative detail, that many students want and probably need."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Soviet Russian State is described as a comprehensive and balanced textbook designed for undergraduate courses focusing on Soviet politics. It covers a wide range of topics related to the Soviet system, offering in-depth analysis. While it occasionally relies on common knowledge and oversimplifications, Professor Wesson effectively delivers on his objective, providing a readable and integrated textbook that includes detailed illustrations. However, there are instances where the book could delve deeper into the complexities of organizational relationships, as noted by the critique of the chapter on "The Party," which relies heavily on traditional perspectives without considering the intricacies of inter- and intra-organizational dynamics.

[1] "In consequence,the reader is left with only a few disjointed insights into the dynamics of Soviet society and almost no coherent guidelines for independent thinking and research."
[2] "This would be lamentable under any circumstances, but it is particularly so in the case of a badly neglected field where acceptable texts are rare and works of in-depth scholarship are virtually nonexistent."
[3] "The result,not surprisingly,is a relentless exposure of Soviet hypocrisy-one with which most scholars in the field (the reviewer included) would probably sympathize, yet one that may strike some student readers as evidence of 'anti-Soviet bias.'"
