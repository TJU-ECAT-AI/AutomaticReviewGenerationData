[4] "Despite the occasional overgeneralization or dubious assertion of fact, Professor Wesson nevertheless has fundamentally achieved what he set out to do."
[5] "He has written the kind of readable textbook, thematically integrated but with much useful illustrative detail, that many students want and probably need."
