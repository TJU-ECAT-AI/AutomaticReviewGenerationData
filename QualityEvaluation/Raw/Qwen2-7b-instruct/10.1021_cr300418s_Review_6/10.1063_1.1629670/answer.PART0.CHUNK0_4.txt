<p>The dynamics of Cl atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol have been studied by calculation of quasi-classical trajectories, with computation of potential energies and gradients only at the geometries through which the trajectories pass.</p>
<p>In order to gain further insight into the different dynamics of reaction of Cl atoms with alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules, we report fully dimensional classical trajectory calculations for the reactions of ground vibrational state methane, ethane, and methanol, and compare the results with available experimental data.</p>
<p>Our previous experimental studies of the dynamics of reactions of chlorine atoms with methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether,1,2 and methylamine3 showed that hydrogen abstraction from the carbon atom bonded to oxygen or nitrogen gives HCl that is significantly more rotationally excited than are the HCl products of Cl atom reactions with alkanes.46 The source of this greater HCl rotation was attributed to a dipole- dipole interaction between the separating HCl product and polar radical co-product.</p>
<p>Ab initio calculations1013 characterized the system energetics and sta- tionary points on the ground PES, and predicted the ClHC part of the transition state TS! to be linear in both reactions.</p>
<p>Levine and co-workers14 constructed a number of model PESs for the Cl1CH4 reaction system and performed a de- tailed dynamical study via classical trajectory calculations. They found that the essential features of the dynamics are insensitive to the level of detail with which the CH3 group is described.</p>
<p>The reactions of Cl atoms with both ground and vibra- tionally excited methane and ethane have been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Ab initio calculations1013 characterized the system energetics and sta- tionary points on the ground PES, and predicted the ClHC part of the transition state TS! to be linear in both reactions.</p>
<p>Calculations of stationary point energies and geometries for the reaction of Cl atoms with methanol demonstrate that reaction proceeds along a mini- mum energy pathway that incorporates lower energy pre- and post-transition state intermediate complexes,1,23 bound by 24.64 and 29.64 kcal mol21, respectively, relative to the reagent energies.</p>

The computational methods used in the study include the calculation of quasi-classical trajectories for Cl atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol. Potential energies and gradients are computed only at the geometries passed through by the trajectories. The dynamics of these reactions are compared with experimental data. The studies aim to understand the differences in reaction dynamics between Cl atom reactions with alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules. Ab initio calculations are employed to characterize the system energetics and stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES). Model potential energy surfaces are constructed for the Cl1CH4 reaction system to perform detailed dynamical studies. Both ground and vibrationally excited states of methane and ethane have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically. Stationary point energies and geometries for the reaction of Cl atoms with methanol indicate that the reaction proceeds along a minimum energy pathway with lower energy pre- and post-transition state intermediates.
