<p>Our previous experimental studies of the dynamics of reactions of chlorine atoms with methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether,1,2 and methylamine3 showed that hydrogen abstraction from the carbon atom bonded to oxygen or nitrogen gives HCl that is significantly more rotationally excited than are the HCl products of Cl atom reactions with alkanes.46 The source of this greater HCl rotation was attributed to a dipole- dipole interaction between the separating HCl product and polar radical co-product. Each reaction pathway exhibits a shallow well in the exit valley of the potential energy surface PES! that is, in part, a consequence of this dipole-dipole interaction, and which may influence the reaction dynamics.</p>

<p>Answer: The source of the greater rotational excitation of HCl products from reactions of chlorine atoms with methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, and methylamine compared to reactions with alkanes is attributed to a dipole-dipole interaction between the separating HCl product and a polar radical co-product. This interaction creates a shallow well in the exit valley of the potential energy surface, which affects the reaction dynamics.</p>

答案：氯原子与甲醇、乙醇、二甲醚和甲胺反应生成的盐酸的旋转激发度大于与烷烃反应生成的盐酸，其原因是分离的盐酸产物与极性自由基共产物之间存在偶极-偶极相互作用。这种相互作用在退出势能表面的山谷中形成一个浅阱，影响了反应动力学。
