[1] "In order to gain further insight into the different dynamics of reaction of Cl atoms with alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules, we report fully dimensional classical trajectory calculations for the reactions of ground vibrational state methane, ethane, and methanol, and compare the results with available experimental data."
[2] "Theoretical studies of reaction dynamics are an invaluable aide to understanding experimental data, and thereby extracting as much insight as possible from the latter. In particular, classical or quasi-classical! trajectory studies, de- spite their known limitations arising from the neglect of most quantum effects, are of great worth given their ready visual interpretation."
[3] "The calculations thereby exhibit somewhat greater rotational excitation than is found experimentally, but correctly describe the trend of increasing HCl product rotation for the three respective reactions."
[4] "For the reaction of Cl atoms with ethane and with methanol, the corresponding values for radical internal energy, HCl rotation and product translation are 21, 3, and 42%, and 46, 13, and 42%, respectively."
[5] "The calculated dipole moments of the HCl and radical products de- pend markedly upon the level of theory used, and are seen to correlate well with the calculated degree of HCl rotational excitation."

Classical trajectory calculations were employed to study the dynamics of chlorine atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol. These calculations were compared with experimental data to gain insights into the differences in reaction dynamics between alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules. Despite the limitations of classical trajectory studies due to the neglect of quantum effects, they provide valuable aids for interpreting experimental data. The calculations revealed that the HCl products from these reactions exhibit greater rotational excitation than observed experimentally. For the reactions of chlorine atoms with ethane and methanol, the percentage of energy allocated to radical internal energy, HCl rotation, and product translation were 21%, 3%, and 42% respectively for ethane, and 46%, 13%, and 42% for methanol. The calculated dipole moments of the HCl and radical products varied depending on the level of theory used, and correlated well with the degree of HCl rotational excitation.

为了进一步理解氯原子与烷烃和氧有机分子反应动力学的差异，我们报告了对甲烷、乙烷和甲醇的基态振动态下反应的全维经典轨迹计算，并将结果与可用的实验数据进行了比较。尽管经典轨迹研究由于忽略了大部分量子效应而存在局限性，但它们对于解读实验数据具有不可替代的价值。计算结果显示，这些反应生成的HCl分子的旋转激发度大于实验观察到的值，但正确描述了三种反应中HCl产品旋转激发度的递增趋势。对于氯原子与乙烷和甲醇的反应，分别有21%，3%，42%的能量分配给自由基内部能量、HCl旋转和产物平移；而对于甲醇反应，则分别为46%，13%，42%。计算得到的HCl和自由基产品的偶极矩随所使用的理论水平的不同而变化，并且与HCl旋转激发度的计算值有很好的相关性。

Extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted on the potential energy surfaces for chlorine atom reactions with both ground-state and vibrationally excited methane and ethane. The calculated dipole moments of the HCl and radical products vary significantly depending on the theoretical level used, and correlate well with the calculated degree of HCl rotational excitation. Both ground-state and vibrationally excited methane and ethane have been intensely studied through experimental and theoretical approaches. For the reaction of chlorine atoms with methanol, the respective percentages for radical internal energy, HCl rotation, and product translation are 46%, 13%, and 42%. The calculations show somewhat higher rotational excitation than observed experimentally, but accurately depict the trend of increasing HCl product rotation across the three reactions.
