<p>Our previous experimental studies of the dynamics of reactions of chlorine atoms with methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether,1,2 and methylamine3 showed that hydrogen abstraction from the carbon atom bonded to oxygen or nitrogen gives HCl that is significantly more rotationally excited than are the HCl products of Cl atom reactions with alkanes.46 The source of this greater HCl rotation was attributed to a dipole- dipole interaction between the separating HCl product and polar radical co-product.</p>
<p>In order to gain further insight into the different dynamics of reaction of Cl atoms with alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules, we report fully dimensional classical trajectory calculations for the reactions of ground vibrational state methane, ethane, and methanol, and compare the results with available experimental data.</p>
<p>The reactions of Cl atoms with both ground and vibra- tionally excited methane and ethane have been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Ab initio calculations1013 characterized the system energetics and sta- tionary points on the ground PES, and predicted the ClHC part of the transition state TS! to be linear in both reactions.</p>
<p>Calculations of stationary point energies and geometries for the reaction of Cl atoms with methanol demonstrate that reaction proceeds along a mini- mum energy pathway that incorporates lower energy pre- and post-transition state intermediate complexes,1,23 bound by 24.64 and 29.64 kcal mol21, respectively, relative to the reagent energies.</p>
<p>II. METHODS OF CALCULATION</p>
<p>Ab initio electronic structure calculations were per- formed at several levels of theory to optimize geometries and energies and calculate zero-point harmonic vibrational fre- quencies in order to characterize stationary points reagents,molecular complexes, transition states and products! on the PESs of the systems studied.</p>
<p>For trajectories with the ZPE included in all vibrational modes, more than 95% finished normally, i.e., they resulted in dissociation into HCl and a radical fragment, while the remainder recrossed the transition state and reverted back to separated reagents.</p>
<p>The computed distributions of HCl prod- ucts over rotational quantum states from the reactions of Cl atoms with methane, ethane and methanol. The calculated distributions are compared with experimental results,1,2,46 with the distributions normalized such that the sums of rela- tive populations of J8 levels up to J854, 6, and 11 for the methane, ethane and methanol reactions are unity.</p>

The document provides insights into the dynamics of Cl atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol. The calculations aim to understand differences in reaction dynamics between alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules. The document highlights the use of classical trajectory calculations and ab initio electronic structure methods to predict reaction pathways, energies, and product distributions. It discusses the role of dipole-dipole interactions in generating rotational excitation of HCl products. Comparisons are made with experimental data to validate the theoretical predictions.
