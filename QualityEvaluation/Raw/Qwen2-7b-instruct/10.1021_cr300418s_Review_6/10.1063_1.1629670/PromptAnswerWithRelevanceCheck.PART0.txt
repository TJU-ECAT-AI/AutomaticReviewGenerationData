[1] "In order to gain further insight into the different dynamics of reaction of Cl atoms with alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules, we report fully dimensional classical trajectory calculations for the reactions of ground vibrational state methane, ethane, and methanol, and compare the results with available experimental data."
[2] "Theoretical studies of reaction dynamics are an invaluable aide to understanding experimental data, and thereby extracting as much insight as possible from the latter. In particular, classical or quasi-classical! trajectory studies, de- spite their known limitations arising from the neglect of most quantum effects, are of great worth given their ready visual interpretation."
[3] "The calculations thereby exhibit somewhat greater rotational excitation than is found experimentally, but correctly describe the trend of increasing HCl product rotation for the three respective reactions."
[4] "For the reaction of Cl atoms with ethane and with methanol, the corresponding values for radical internal energy, HCl rotation and product translation are 21, 3, and 42%, and 46, 13, and 42%, respectively."
[5] "The calculated dipole moments of the HCl and radical products de- pend markedly upon the level of theory used, and are seen to correlate well with the calculated degree of HCl rotational excitation."

Classical trajectory calculations were employed to study the dynamics of chlorine atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol. These calculations were compared with experimental data to gain insights into the differences in reaction dynamics between alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules. Despite the limitations of classical trajectory studies due to the neglect of quantum effects, they provide valuable aids for interpreting experimental data. The calculations revealed that the HCl products from these reactions exhibit greater rotational excitation than observed experimentally. For the reactions of chlorine atoms with ethane and methanol, the percentage of energy allocated to radical internal energy, HCl rotation, and product translation were 21%, 3%, and 42% respectively for ethane, and 46%, 13%, and 42% for methanol. The calculated dipole moments of the HCl and radical products varied depending on the level of theory used, and correlated well with the degree of HCl rotational excitation.

Extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted on the potential energy surfaces for chlorine atom reactions with both ground-state and vibrationally excited methane and ethane. The calculated dipole moments of the HCl and radical products vary significantly depending on the theoretical level used, and correlate well with the calculated degree of HCl rotational excitation. Both ground-state and vibrationally excited methane and ethane have been intensely studied through experimental and theoretical approaches. For the reaction of chlorine atoms with methanol, the respective percentages for radical internal energy, HCl rotation, and product translation are 46%, 13%, and 42%. The calculations show somewhat higher rotational excitation than observed experimentally, but accurately depict the trend of increasing HCl product rotation across the three reactions.

<p>Our previous experimental studies of the dynamics of reactions of chlorine atoms with methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether,1,2 and methylamine3 showed that hydrogen abstraction from the carbon atom bonded to oxygen or nitrogen gives HCl that is significantly more rotationally excited than are the HCl products of Cl atom reactions with alkanes.46 The source of this greater HCl rotation was attributed to a dipole- dipole interaction between the separating HCl product and polar radical co-product. Each reaction pathway exhibits a shallow well in the exit valley of the potential energy surface PES! that is, in part, a consequence of this dipole-dipole interaction, and which may influence the reaction dynamics.</p>

<p>Answer: The source of the greater rotational excitation of HCl products from reactions of chlorine atoms with methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, and methylamine compared to reactions with alkanes is attributed to a dipole-dipole interaction between the separating HCl product and a polar radical co-product. This interaction creates a shallow well in the exit valley of the potential energy surface, which affects the reaction dynamics.</p>

The document highlights the importance of computational methods in understanding the dynamics of chlorine atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol. It mentions that theoretical studies, particularly classical trajectory calculations, are crucial tools for interpreting experimental data and gaining insights into reaction mechanisms. The authors conducted extensive simulations of these reactions using different levels of theory, including Hartree-Fock (HF) and second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). These calculations allowed them to analyze the post-transition state dynamics, rotational excitation of products, and energy partitioning in these reactions.

The computational methods used in the study include the calculation of quasi-classical trajectories for Cl atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol. Potential energies and gradients are computed only at the geometries passed through by the trajectories. The dynamics of these reactions are compared with experimental data. The studies aim to understand the differences in reaction dynamics between Cl atom reactions with alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules. Ab initio calculations are employed to characterize the system energetics and stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES). Model potential energy surfaces are constructed for the Cl1CH4 reaction system to perform detailed dynamical studies. Both ground and vibrationally excited states of methane and ethane have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically. Stationary point energies and geometries for the reaction of Cl atoms with methanol indicate that the reaction proceeds along a minimum energy pathway with lower energy pre- and post-transition state intermediates.
