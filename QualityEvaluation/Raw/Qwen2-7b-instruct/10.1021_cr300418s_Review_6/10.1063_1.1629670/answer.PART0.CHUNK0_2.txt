[1] "The reactions of Cl atoms with both ground and vibrationally excited methane and ethane have been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically."
[2] "Theoretical studies of reaction dynamics are an invaluable aide to understanding experimental data, and thereby extracting as much insight as possible from the latter."
[3] "In order to gain further insight into the different dynamics of reaction of Cl atoms with alkanes and oxygenated organic molecules, we report fully dimensional classical trajectory calculations for the reactions of ground vibrational state methane, ethane, and methanol, and compare the results with available experimental data."
[4] "The dynamics of Cl atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol have been studied by calculation of quasi-classical trajectories, with computation of potential energies and gradients only at the geometries through which the trajectories pass."
[5] "The reactions of Cl atoms with methane,ethane and methanol were studied by calculation of quasi-classical trajectories using potential energies and gradients computed at the HF/6-31G and MP2/6-311G(d,p) levels of theory."

The document highlights the importance of computational methods in understanding the dynamics of chlorine atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol. It mentions that theoretical studies, particularly classical trajectory calculations, are crucial tools for interpreting experimental data and gaining insights into reaction mechanisms. The authors conducted extensive simulations of these reactions using different levels of theory, including Hartree-Fock (HF) and second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). These calculations allowed them to analyze the post-transition state dynamics, rotational excitation of products, and energy partitioning in these reactions.
