This critical review describes the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts from the point of view of four simple, but essential for Chemistry, molecules (namely dihydrogen, carbon monoxide,nitrogen monoxide and ethylene) that are considered as probes or as reactants in combination with in situ controlled temperature and pressure Infrared spectroscopy. The fundamental properties of H2, CO, NO and C2H4 are shortly described in order to justify their different behaviour in respect of isolated sites in different environments, extended surfaces, clusters,crystalline or amorphous materials. The description is given by considering some key studies and trying to evidence similarities and differences among surfaces and probes (572 references).

Introduction: Probing a surface Heterogeneous catalysts are complex systems whose properties are given by a combination of multiple factors. Activity,selectivity and life-time of the catalyst are determined by the optimum combination of specific features that range from nano to micro and macro properties of the surface properties of the catalyst.1 A powerful tool to obtain a detailed descrip- tion of the catalyst surface properties is the use of probe molecules in combination with an investigative technique able to monitor with the sufficient sensitivity the probe surface interaction.222 One of the most widely used techniques that follows this approach, is Mid-infrared spectroscopy (4200400 cm1) using appropriate probe molecules. The method is indirect, in the sense that it monitors the surface through the perturbation inferred to the probe. The observables are the changes in vibrational frequency and intensity of the probe modes. IR-inactive modes can also be observed as a result of the interaction with the surface. In some cases it is also possible to follow induced changes of skeletal and surfaces modes of the catalysts2325 and or to follow a reaction-dynamic on the surface.16,20,26,27 In this respect, time- and temperature- resolved FTIR spectroscopy has the potential to detect inter- mediate species in a reaction chain.20 In this contribution we have chosen four probe molecules (H2, CO, NO and C2H4) and for each of them we will report some case studies in which they behave as probe molecules and or as reagent. a Department of Inorganic, Physical and Materials Chemistry, NIS Centre of Excellence, and INSTM reference center, University of Turin.

CRITICAL REVIEW

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Ideally, molecular probes for IR studies should satisfy the following requirements (i) small size, so that the probe can monitor surfaces in all details, (ii) detectable by infrared and associated by features that can discriminate between surface sites of different nature, (iii) high extinction coefficients, so as to lead to optimum detection sensitivity, (iv) the probe molecule should allow to perform quantitative determinations and be responsive not only to the surface site but also to its close environment, this is particularly relevant for detecting bi-functional surface sites, and (v) in order to avoid alterations of the material under test, probesurface interaction should be ideally weak. Exception to point (i) can be done in some specific cases, like Brnsted sites in zeolites, where IR spectro- scopy allows to measure both the perturbation of the molecule on the adsorbing site and the perturbation of the latter induced by probe adsorption. In these cases, the parallel use of different probe molecules of increasing size (NH3 and TMA or Py and collidine etc. . .) can result in a surface site speciation able to discriminate the different adsorbing sites on the basis of their accessibility.22,2830

Dihydrogen
2.1
The Dihydrogen molecule, its vibrational properties and the experimental set up Dihydrogen is an attractive probe molecule for many reasons31 (i) the small dimensions should allow a very detailed descrip- tion of surfaces and cavities; (ii) the unperturbed n(HH) mode is IR-inactive so, any band appearing in the IR is due with perturbations induced by the adsorption process; (iii) H2 is highly sensitive to surface heterogeneity: even small pertur- bations of the single HH bond induced by interaction with surface centers lead to shift of the n(HH) stretching mode larger than those observed for probes containing multiple bonds (N2, O2, CO)32 and finally (iv) because of its amphoteric character (quadrupolar moment as shown in the bottom inset of Fig. 1), H2 is able to test both acidic and basic surface sites.
A limitation in the use of H2 as a probe is however represented by the very low interaction energy with most adsorbing centers, a fact which often requires very low temperatures (at least 77 K or even lower, vide infra) to obtain reasonable H2 coverage.17,31,3338 This justifies the smaller number of papers published so far on the IR spectra of adsorbed dihydrogen in respect of parallel studies made by using other probe molecules.
Before going on to illustrate and discuss the manifestations of adsorbed H2, it is useful to shortly summarize the basic spectroscopic properties of the dihydrogen molecule in the free (gaseous) state:3941 (i) dihydrogens exist as two isomers differing for the orientation of the nuclear spins, i.e., para- (nuclear singlet state, I = 0) and ortho-H2 (nuclear triplet state, I = 1); (ii) nuclear statistic confines the two spin isomers to different rotational states, characterized by even Fig. 1 Vibrational manifestations of ortho-H2 (I = 1) and para-H2 (I = 0). The main part reports in the (42204100 cm1 region) the Raman spectrum of unperturbed H2 in the gas phase (pure vibrational modes). The rotationalvibrational Raman spectrum of gaseous H2 is reported in the top inset (44504750 cm1 region). Only the two narrow components are pertinent, the intense and broad band at ca. 4570 cm1 being due to fluorescence by the quartz cell. Bottom inset:electrostatic potential curves of H2 showing the quadrupolar nature of the molecule. Unpublished figure.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 4953 J (rotational quantum number) values for para- and by odd J values for ortho-H2; (iii) the two isomers give rise to distinguishable spectroscopic manifestations in the Raman spectrum of normal H2 as depicted in Fig. 1, that reports the data for vibrational and rotational-vibrational spectra of gaseous dihydrogen.42 The n = 0 - n = 1 transition (n, vibrational quantum number) in para-(Q(0)) and ortho-H2 (Q(1)) are at 4161 and 4155 cm1, respectively. The Q1(0) and Q1(1) components shift to lower frequency (812 cm1) on passing from gaseous to liquid and solid H2 and, as their separation increases, passing from 6 (gas) to 9 (solid) cm1.
For what concerns the vibrationalrotational components, the lowest in frequency is the S1(0) at 4500 cm1 for para-H2 and the S1(1) at 4715 cm1 for ortho-H2. Finally, although the equilibrium ortho/para ratio is a function of the temperature (e.g., it is 3 : 1 at 298 K and about 1 : 99 at 20 K), the interconversion of ortho-H2 to the more stable para form is very slow even in the liquid state, since it requires an inversion of nuclear spins.43,44 Faster interconversion can be promoted by spin catalysis (vide for instance ref. 45 and references therein) through adsorption on metals such as tungsten and nickel and solids with surface-active and paramagnetic centers (vide infra). Because the nuclear spin is reversed without breaking the HH bond,44 and the two H2 species have different spectroscopic features, the evolution of one species to the other can be followed during an IR experiment.
The infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed using an ad hoc designed cryogenic cell allowing (i) the in situ high-temperature activation of the sample under high vacuum conditions or in the desired atmosphere. (ii) to perform FTIR adsorption experiments at fixed temperature, as low as ca. 20 K (estimated at the sample level), and variable H2 pressure (in the 00.5 bar range); (iii) to record the IR spectra of the species adsorbed in the whole 30020 K temperature interval while simultaneously measuring the gas-phase equilibrium pressure (PH2), a procedure which allows us to obtain the site-specific adsorption enthalpy.17 A detailed description of the cryogenic cell (consisting of a modified closed circuit liquid helium Oxford CCC 1204 cryostat) is given elsewhere.14 The FTIR spectra were collected in transmission mode (at 2 cm1 resolution) on a Bruker Equinox-55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector whose sample compartment was modified ad hoc to accommodate the cryogenic IR cell.
In the following we will use the wavenumber of the Q(0) mode of para-H2 as reference for the unperturbed molecule:
n0(HH) = 4161 cm1; from this reference all shifts undergone by the H2 molecule upon adsorption on a surface site will be defined as D n(HH) = n(HH) n0(HH). As the n(HH) mode of the dihydrogen molecule undergoes a batochromic- (or red-) shift upon adsorption, observed D n(HH) shifts will be negative.
Hereafter, the interaction of H2 with the following class of materials will be reviewed from the insight of IR spectroscopy;section
2.2: microporous
polymers;section
2.3: zeolitic
materials; section 2.4: MOFs materials; section 2.5: high surface area oxides; section 2.6: composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic materials. This list, drawn on the basis of the authors back- ground, is of course far from exhaustive. Interaction of H2 with graphitic materials like high surface area carbons, carbon nanotubes, graphane layers is of course a very important chapter in materials science,4649 that has been overlooked in this review owing to the extremely high experimental difficulties encountered in collecting IR spectra from this black class of materials.50 Inelastic neutron scattering,5153 Raman spectroscopy54 and ab initio calculations5559 are more appropriate techniques in this regard.
2.2
Dihydrogen exploring unpolar cavities: Adsorption in microporous polymers Surfaces of polymeric microporous materials are hardly charac- terized by probe molecules due to the mostly unpolar character of their surfaces, nevertheless, dihydrogen has proven to be able to discriminate materials characterized by crystalline microporous ordered phases from totally disordered systems.60 Due to the absence of specific polarizing sites, molecular hydrogen adsorbs on these materials only at a tempera- ture close to that of liquid helium (approximately 20 K).
Fig. 2a compares the spectra obtained at highest coverage (PH2 = 30 mbar) on two aerogels both with 35% crystallinity and 90% porosity, one nanoporous (d phase, black curve in Fig. 2a), the second dense (b phase, dark grey curve); H2 adsorbed in a commercial St-DVB material with high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) is also shown for the sake of comparison. d and b phases were used as prepared, in the form of small cylinders with a diameter of about 1 cm and 0.5 cm thick. The St-DVB sample was measured on a self-supporting pellet obtained by finely grinding the commercial beads. Before H2 adsorption all the samples were outgassed overnight under high vacuum (residual pressure o106 bar) at 300 K to remove adsorbed impurities.
A downward shift in respect to the Raman frequency of the free molecule in the range of D n(HH) = 1060 cm1 agrees with the calculations of Hu bner et al.61 and can be ascribed to Fig. 2 Part (a): Infrared spectrum of H2 adsorbed at 20 K on d-form aerogels of s-PS (black line); on a s-PS b-form aerogel of similar morphology (dark grey line) and on a commercial St-DVB resin with surface area of ca. 1000 m2 g1 (light grey line). PH2 = 30 mbar;a.u. = absorbance units. Part (b): Dependence of the spectrum of dihydrogen adsorbed at 20 K on the d-form aerogels of s-PS on the
PH2. The most intense spectrum is the same reported in part (a), the
least intense after prolonged outgassing at 20 K. Insets of parts (a) and (b) reports a schematic representation of high and medium H2 loadings, respectively.

Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 the interaction of H2 with the electron rich part of the polymeric structures (phenyl rings) through weak dispersive forces.42 These absorptions are intense and well defined for the d aerogel showing some narrow or very narrow components centered at ca. 4145 (with two shoulders at higher and lower frequency), 4136, 4117 and 4107 cm1 while are negligible for the b aerogel. This clearly indicates that the FTIR peaks of Fig. 2a (black line) correspond to specific interactions of H2 with the phenyl rings of the nanoporous crystalline phase. On the contrary, the spectrum obtained for the fully amorphous cross-linked polystyrene (light grey curve), while covering the same spectral range, consists of a broad nearly structureless absorption (full width at half maximum ca. 40 cm1). The fine structure characteristic of d phase has been considered a consequence of the presence of a regular arrangement of the adsorbing centers which induces ordering of the H2 molecules in the adsorbed phases. The dependence of the H2 spectrum on the gas equilibrium pressure for the adsorption at 20 K on the d aerogel of s-PS is shown in Fig. 2b. It is evident that the components in the 41254100 cm1 range are the last to disappear on lowering the H2 equilibrium pressure and must be hence associated with stronger adsorption sites (as compared to those responsible for the bands in the 41554125 cm1 interval). A plausible hypothesis is that these sites are associated with more confined regions of the cavities of the d phase. The inclusion of four H2 molecules per each crystalline cavity (up to 2 wt%) of the nanoporous d phase has been shown by molecular simulations (Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations) and confirmed by gravimetric measurements.60 This H2 uptake in the crystalline cavities has been shown to be additive with respect to the H2 adsorp- tion on the surface of the aerogel nanofibers.
2.3
Dihydrogen exploring zeolitic cavities: Interaction with walls, framework and extraframework sites Among microporous materials, zeolites represent probably one of the most studied in the field of heterogeneous catalysts.
The possibility to choose the Si/Al ratio in synthetic zeolites in wide ranges, makes it possible to modulate the ionicity of the material (which increases with decreasing Si/Al ratio). The net formal charge associated with each the AlO4, units is 1e, so that the zeolite framework is negatively charged. The net negative charge is balanced by Mn+ cations (Lewis acid centres),or by protons in the acidic form of the zeolite. These ions are not a part of the zeolite framework, and can be exchanged by other cations, affecting acidity and internal electric fields.
Brnsted acidity arises from bridging Si(OH)Al groups in the protonic form of zeolites. An important source of Lewis acidity concerns structural defects and extraframework aggregates. All these aspects can be easily monitored by dihydrogen adsorption at temperature comprised in the 7720 K to give OH  H2 (Brnsted sites) and Mn+  H2 (Lewis sites) adducts.
2.3.1
Silicalite and alkali-metal-exchanged zeolites. Fig. 3 compares H2 isotherms collected at 20 K, of H2 adsorbed on silicalite, Na-ZSM-5 and Na-LTA zeolites. H2 adsorp- tion on silicalite, (Fig. 3c) shows a complex set of narrow bands (less than 5 cm1 at half maximum) growing in the 41504130 cm1 range that change in intensity ratio upon increasing coverage, testifying the formation of organized structures due to molecular hydrogen condensed inside the cavities. These features, only observable in the case of spectra collected at very low temperature, tend to disappear when specific interactions occur and/or when the cavities become larger (vide infra). In the case of Na+ exchanged zeolites, the appearance of bands associated to dihydrogen perturbed by Na+ cations is observed, as widely reported in previous literature.31,36,38,62 The set of spectra reported in Fig. 3b in the case of Na+ exchanged ZSM-5, characterized by a much broader character, are dominated by a main band that appears at 4100 cm1 and shifts to 4108 cm1 upon increasing coverage.
Note the absence of any fine structure of the spectra previously observed in the case of pure silicalite (Fig. 3c). Moving to Na-LTA (Fig. 3a), upon increasing PH2, a band which appeared at 4075 cm1 shifts to 4091 cm1. The difference between the data obtained in case of Na-ZSM-5 and Na-LTA should be associated with the different topology of the framework and to the fact that in the case of LTA, simultaneous interaction with more than one site can occur. A large variety of spectroscopic data, in combination with molecular modeling calculations have been reported and deeply discussed also in terms of interaction enthalpy, in some recent papers63,64 in the case of H2 adsorption on alkaline cations exchanged zeolites. Inter- action of CO and NO probes on alkalimetal exchanged zeolites will be discussed in sections 3.2.1 and 4.2, respectively.
A particularly high loading of extraframework cations can be reached in zeotype materials such as ETS-10, a silicon titanate characterized by a crystalline structure formed by orthogonal chains of corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra linked by SiO4 tetrahedra giving rise to a regular three-dimensional arrangement of 12- and 7-ring channels.6569 The presence of TiOTi wires gives ETS-10 peculiar optical properties,7075 while the channel system is responsible for its behavior as a molecular sieve. Every TiO6 unit introduces a 2e net charge which is compensated in as-synthesized ETS-10 by Fig. 3 FTIR spectra (background subtracted) of H2 adsorbed on Na-LTA, Na-ZSM-5 and silicalite, parts (a), (b) and (c), respectively.

In the spectrum collected immediately after H2 dosage (dashed line in Fig. 4a) three intense bands at 4111, 4120 (broad) and 4138 cm1 have been assigned to the HH stretching vibration of hydrogen molecules adsorbed on the extra-framework cations (band at 4111 cm1),on the channels wall (band 4120 cm1), and to molecules forming a liquid-like phase entrapped inside the 12 membered ETS-10 channels (band at 4138 cm1) respectively. All these bands gradually decrease in intensity with time with the parallel formation of a new, upward shifted triplet at 4118, 4127 and 4146 cm1 (grey curves in Fig. 4a); this transformation is nearly complete after 10 h of contact (black solid line in Fig. 4a). The appearance of three isosbestic points at 4115,4124 and 4140 cm1, leads to the conclusion that the dihydrogen adducts responsible for the first triplet of bands are transformed into those responsible for the second triplet following a 1 : 1 stoichiometry (see the arrows). As the bands correlated by arrows in Fig. 4a are separated by 78 cm1, we conclude that the evolution of the spectra is indicative of the ortho to para conversion of the adsorbed dihydrogen species. Main features coming from the set of spectra collected upon changing dihydrogen equilibrium pressure (Fig. 4b) are the following:(i) the spectrum at low H2 pressures consists of a doublet of bands at 4113 and 4107 cm1. The 41134107 cm1 doublet is downward shifted of D n(HH) = 48 cm1 with respect to the n(HH) frequency of gas phase p-(4161 cm1) and o-H2 (4155 cm1), in agreement with the experimental observations35,36,38 and the theoretical predictions80 for the side-on interaction of molecular hydrogen on Na+ sites in a variety of microporous systems.
(ii) Upon further PH2 increase, the doublet reaches a maximum in correspondence with the dashed bold curve and then decreases in intensity (to total disappearance in the last spectrum represented by the full bold line), while a new absorption develops in a parallel way at 4118 cm1 indicating that, at 20 K, the initially formed Na+  H2 complexes can further add H2 to form Na+  (H2)2 moieties.
(iii) As soon as the band at 4118 cm1 due to the Na+  (H2)2 reaches its maximum, further increase of PH2 leads to the appearance of a new absorption centered at 4128 cm1 (D n(HH) D 30 cm1 with respect to gaseous H2).
Bands in similar positions have been observed for the H2 adsorption at 20 K on other microporous systems (vide supra) and assigned to perturbation of the hydrogen molecules by Fig. 4 FTIR spectra (background subtracted) of H2 adsorbed on (Na,K)-ETS-10. Part (a) effect of the contact time at 20 K and constant equilibrium pressure. Dashed bold line: immediately after H2 dosage; full bold line after 10 h of contact at 20 K; light grey lines: intermediate contact times. Part (b) Effect of the H2 equilibrium pressure at 20 K. Maximum coverage (bold black line) effect of progressively reducing the equilibrium gas pressure at 20 K (grey curves). The dashed bold curve corresponds to the pressure at which maximum intensity of the 1 : 1 adduct bands is reached. Red arrows indicate the shifts associated with the three families of interactions (1 : 1 adducts; 1 : 2 adduct; liquid phase, see schemes corresponding in the central part of the Figure). The corresponding bands are evidenced by asterisks, orange, green and dark yellow respectively. The inset of part (b) reports the IR spectrum collected on an almost homo-ionic Na-ETS-10 collected at liquid nitrogen temperature.

The formation of M+  (H2)n adducts with n > 2 can be ruled out by the observation that its growth is not correlated with a decrease in the band of the M+  (H2)2 adducts at 4113 cm1 as well as for steric hindrance reason.
(iv) Finally, the appearance of a component at 4137 cm1 that gradually shifts to 4140 and ends with a strong band at 4146 cm1, testifys the formation of a liquid-like phase filling the ETS-10 channels. Main types of interaction are evidenced by red arrows in part (b) of Fig. 4.
Molecular mechanics calculations on Na-ETS-10 structure have been performed. All details are reported in ref. 78. The results of energy optimizations at different coverages are described in the central part of Fig. 4. The calculated Na+  H2 complexes have a T-shaped geometry, as expected from the H2 electrostatic potential and as verified in several theoretical works.80,81 The most stable geometry of the adsorbed molecules was that with all the H2 molecules disposed parallel to the channel axis. In the 2 : 1 complex the H2 molecules are arranged in such a way as to maximize the distance among them, in agreement with previous literature results.64,82 Schematic representation of the different steps of the dihydrogen adsorption in the ETS-10 at increasing coverage y as from the MM calculations: from top to bottom: y = 1; y = 2; and H2 liquefaction.

2.3.2
Fe-zeolites. Dihydrogen appears as an ideal molecule for the characterization of the Brnsted and Lewis acid properties of a complex system like Fe-silicalite, which is still extensively studied because of the unique properties as catalyst for one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol.8385 The com- plexity of this material derives from the fact that, while in the as synthesized zeolite iron is present in framework tetrahedral positions as Fe3+ (giving so rise to Brnsted acidity associated to the presence of RSi(OH)FeR bridged sites);86 thermal treatments, which are a prerequisite to induction of catalytic activity, result in the breaking of the SiOFe framework bonds and in migration and partial reduction of iron to give a variety of extraframework Fe2+ and Fe3+ centres.8790 Among them, some Fe2+ sites are thought to be the precursors of the species active in partial oxidation.91 The active sites are formed by decomposition of the oxidizing agent (N2O) to give highly reactive oxygen-containing moieties (the so called a-oxygen).92 These aspects will be discussed in more detail in section 4.6, where the probe molecule used to investigate the catalyst surface will be NO.
The spectra obtained upon dosage of H2 (PH2 E 8 kPa) at 20 K on a sample at the three different stages of treatment are compared in Fig. 5a): protonic (activated at 573 K in vacuum:black curve) activated (treated in high vacuum at 973 K: blue curve), oxidized (obtained by treating activated samples in oxygen (13 kPa) at 773 K and outgassing at 573 K: red curve).
All the samples show mediumstrong absorptions in the region 41704100 cm1 while, only on the systems activated at temperatures sufficiently high (973 K), bands appear in 41003900 cm1 range, suggesting that the thermal treatment causes iron migration from framework to extra-framework positions (blue and red curves). The absence of similar manifestation in the case of protonic sample, is in agreement with the fact that tetrahedral Fe3+ in framework positions does not have any adsorptive capability.86 The spectrum of H2 adsorbed on protonic Fe-Silicalite shows an intense absorption due to the superposition of two components, one located at 4137 cm1 and a shoulder at 41464140 cm1 assigned to dihydrogen adsorbed in the internal voids of the zeolite and on the external RSiOH groups respectively.93 A third band at 4112 cm1 is due to the
n(HH) mode of OH  H2 adducts formed on the structural RFe(OH)SiR Brnsted acid sites (see also data concerning H2 adsorption on [Fe]H-ZSM-594 and H-ZSM-532 acid zeolites) and observe its reduction on the activated and oxidized samples (only a tail, covering the 41304100 cm1 interval, is visible). Activated Fe-Silicalite shows a very complex spectrum characterized with at least 2 doublets: one in 41004000 cm1 (maxima at 4050 cm1 and at 4028 cm1) and a second one in the 40003900 cm1 (couple of bands at 3990 and 3960 cm1) ranges.93 Oxidized sample is characterized by the growth in intensity of the second doublet at detriment of the first. This behaviour suggests to rule out the occurrence of overlapping forces, as observed in the case of homogeneous [Fe(Z2-H2)Ln] complexes (where usually iron is present as Fe2+, and L are cyclopentadienil ligands or chelating agents containing Fig. 5 Part (a): IR spectra in the n(HH) region of H2 adsorbed at 20 K and PH2 E 8 kPa on Fe-Silicalite (Si/Fe = 50) activated at 573 K (black curve), Fe-Silicalite activated at 973 K (blue curve) and Fe-Silicalite activated at 973 K and oxidized at 573 K (red curve).The vertical lines delimitate the spectral regions where the n(HH) modes of H2 adsorbed on Brnsted (41704100 cm1) and Lewis (4100ca. 4000 cm1: Fe2+; ca. 40003900 cm1: Fe3+) acid sites are falling.

Polarization of the H2 molecule by the electric field exerted by the Fen+ centres makes it possible to assign the first doublet to Fe2+  H2 adducts while the second to Fe3+  H2 species. This assign- ment is also confirmed by the set of spectra shown in parts (b) and (c) of Fig. 5, that report spectra evolutions upon increasing H2 coverage. The doublet at 3990 and 3960 cm1, more intense in the oxidized sample, is clearly visible starting from very low coverages and saturate very easily, then followed by the bands at 4050 cm1 and at 4028 cm1 more visible on the activated sample. The larger perturbation of the n(HH) mode for the interaction of H2 by Fe3+ species with respect to (less polarizing) Fe2+ is emerging from the D n(HH) (172 and 202 cm1 for Fe3+; 102 and 134 cm1 for Fe2+ sites). The existence in Fe-Silicalite activated at high temperature of a variety of extraframework Fe3+ and Fe2+ centres, in relative concentra- tion depending on the iron content as well as on the activation procedure,has been already hypothesized and demon- strated in previous works based on a variety of experimental techniques;87,98 among them we will cite here the results obtained by the use of IR spectroscopic probes like NO and CO, the former here reviewed in section 4.6. Note that H2,being able to detect and differentiate the presence of two families of Fe2+ and Fe3+respectively behaves like the NO probe in the case of the ferric species and of CO in that of the ferrous ones.87 Formation of the adducts discussed so far are governed by weak polarization forces (which inter alia accounts for their stability at low or very low temperature only); occurrence of overlapping forces, which can operate in the case of transition metal counterions, results in distinctly larger n(HH) shifts.
This is the case for the Cu+/H2 complexes already formed at room temperature in copper exchanged ZSM-5,100 where sp donation/back-donation mechanisms101 similar to those operating in matrix-isolated [Cu(Z2-H2)Cl] molecular adducts102 are responsible for D n(HH) values as large as 1080 cm1.

Dihydrogen exploring metallo-organic frameworks: Effect of framework topologies and cations In relation to studies devoted to develop new materials for molecular hydrogen storage, a wide variety of MOFs have been tested towards dihydrogen interaction with both experi- mental and theoretical approaches.103114 Some results are encouraging, showing that some MOF materials (owing to their extremely large surface area) are able to retain reversibly significant H2 quantities (6.2 and 7.0 mass% for IRMOF-20 and MOF-177 respectively at 70 bar and 70 K, close to the DOE targets). The largest drawback of MOFs for H2 storage application is their weak binding strength to H2, which necessitates a cryogenic working temperature. Extensive efforts were made to synthesize and test, mainly through volumetric/ gravimetric measurements) new MOFs with enhanced H2 affinity, while only a few were based on spectroscopic data.
Most of the data were obtained at low temperature104,111,115 even though a very recent paper reports measurements performed at room temperature and high pressure.116 As already mentioned in the case of studies performed on alkaline metal substituted zeolites,100 also in the case of MOFs, VTIR (Variable Temperature Infrared) spectroscopy was able to give relevant data on interaction energies104,111,115,117 both enthalpy and entropy of H2 on MOFs based on the accessibility and polarizing power of the exposed metal sites: MOF-5 (inaccessible metal sites) and HKUST-1, CPO-27-Ni (accessible metal sites).118 First of all it was noticed that the first spectroscopic features associated with H2 adsorbed on the MOF surface were observed at different temperatures: 180 K for Ni-MOF, 110 K for HKUST and 105 K for MOF-5.
These temperatures correlate with the enthalpy of adsorption obtained by means of the VTIR method on these materials and with the shift experienced by the HH stretching frequency after the adsorption. This relationship can be ascribed to the different nature and accessibility of the metal sites.
In the case of MOF-5 very weak signals at 4121 and 4112 cm1 (grey curve in Fig. 6) are assigned to para- and ortho-H2 adsorbed on weak polarizing sites in proximity of Zn2+and/or close to OH groups in local defect. (DHads = 7.4 kJ mol1) Comparison with the H2 spectra on ZnO rules out any assign- ment to H2 interacting directly with exposed Zn2+ (vide infra section 2.5.2). Upon decreasing the temperature IR spectra become dominated by a component at 4130 cm1 (black curve in Fig. 6) that can be assigned to para-H2 in interaction with the apolar walls of MOF-5 and satellite bands at 4146 and 4138 cm1, due to liquid-like H2 in the MOF-5 channels (para-ad ortho-H2 respectively).104,119 In this regard it is worth recalling that the group of Zerbi120 has performed a Fig. 6 IR spectra of H2 adsorbed at low temperature on: MOF-5, HKUST-1, and CPO-27-Ni from bottom to top respectively. Red,blue and black curves correspond to spectra obtained at high coverages and at 20 K. Orange, cyan and light grey correspond to spectra obtained at low coverages and higher temperature. Left and right sides of the figure, from bottom to top: unit cells, and electro- static potential maps around the metal sites for MOF-5, HKUST-1,and CPO-27-Ni. The C atoms are reported in grey; H atoms, in white; O, in red; Zn, in cyan; Cu, in blue; and Ni, in green. The iso-surfaces corresponding to values of 0.015 and +0.015 au are reported in yellow and blue, respectively. Figure adapted with permission from ref. 111 (copyright American Chemical Society 2008).

Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 Raman study on the interaction of MOF-5 with both H2 and D2.
The IR spectrum obtained in the case of H2 adsorption at low coverage in the case of HKUST-1 (cyan curve in Fig. 6) is characterized by a doublet at 4097 and 4090 cm1 assigned to para-H2  Cu2+ and ortho-H2  Cu2+ complexes.117 (DHads = 10.1 kJ mol1) Frequency shifts and interaction enthalpy found in HKUST-1 suggest that Cu2+ ions are partially shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the carboxylate units and behave like purely polarizing centers where d-electrons do not effect the interaction with H2. Upon decreasing the temperature to 20 K a new adsorption grows at 4084 cm1 with a shoulder at 4089 cm1 while the growth of bands due to H2 (ortho and para) interacting with the organic part of the framework (presumably the phenyl rings) is occurring in the 41204150 cm1 range (main band centered at 4136 cm1) (dashed dot blue curve). Sample equilibration at 20 K (30 min) at constant pressure (full line blue curve) causes the selective decrease of the band at 4084 cm1, the parallel growth of the component at 4089 cm1 (clear isosbestic point at 4087 cm1), the disappearance of the band at 4133 cm1,and the small increase of all the others components (4137, 4140,and 4148 cm1). These time-dependent spectral changes are associated with conversion of ortho-into the more stable para-H2, implying that Cu2+ species in HKUST-1 acts as a spin catalyst, similarly to other oxidic materials containing paramagnetic impurities.44 Note that the time scale for the extensive ortho/para-H2 conversion is much shorter than that reported for pure H2 121 and for H2 in other microporous materials78 at comparable temperatures.
Dihydrogen is strongly perturbed by CPO-27-Ni, as testified by the doublet observed at 4035 and 4028 cm1 (D n(HH) = 130 cm1 DHads = 13.7 kJ mol1)111 starting from 180 K (orange curve in Fig. 6). The two bands can be assigned to two spectroscopically non equivalent Ni2+  H2 complexes or to the para and ortho-species respectively. Upon decreasing the temperature till 20 K, the IR spectrum changes substantially (red curve) taking into account also of the interactions with the benzene rings (bands at 4128 and 4132 cm1) and to the formation of a liquid-like H2 phase (band at 4147 cm1).
Unlike MOF-5 and HKUST-1, in Ni-CPO-27 the adsorption is irreversible at 20 K. The need to increase the temperature to be able to desorb H2 influences also the equilibrium between ortho and para species, making difficult the final assignment.
All of these observations allow to identify in CPO-27-Ni the material with the best performances, on the basis of purely energetic evaluations.
Isostructural CPO-27 (M = Co, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) frame- works have been studied by Zhou et al.122 in terms of strength of dihydrogen binding. In this series the highest binding affinity for Ni2+ sites was found (Zn2+ o Mn2+ o Mg2+ o Co2+ o Ni2+). Fig. 7 report IR data obtained for H2 inter- action with isostructural CPO-27-M (M = Mg, Co and Ni) frameworks in grey, green and red respectively. For all the investigated isostructural CPO-27-M, dihydrogen adsorption,on lowering the temperature, follows essentially three steps:(i) formation of metal hydrogen complex
(M2+  H2),
(ii) adsorption on the benzene ring and (iii) condensation inside the pore (liquid like H2). Points (ii) and (iii) develop very similarly in the three samples, while point (i), related to the role of the cations toward dihydrogen binding, specific features are observed with respect to:n(HH) vibration shift,onset temperature (Tonset) and enthalpy of complex formation.
In the case of CPO-27-Mg a doublet at 4092 and 4086 cm1 is observed at low coverage (starting from 130 K, light grey curve). Spectra evolve upon cooling the sample at 20 K,showing the growth of components 4126 and 4137 cm1, while the component at 4086 cm1 decreases substantially in intensity becoming a shoulder of the main component at 4092 cm1.
Upon decreasing the equilibrium pressure, the component at 4086 cm1 becomes visible again, even if it is always less intense than the band at higher wavenumber,123 this implies that an orthopara conversion has occurred. This observation suggests that the doublet at 4035 and 4028 cm1, observed in the case of CPO-27-Ni, can be explained in term of orthopara dihydrogen components in analogy to what was found in the case of CPO-27-Mg. The reason why in CPO-27Ni it is not observed as an intensity ratio change within the doublet,indicates that a total orthopara conversion has already occurred extensively within the time scale of the experiment (a few seconds).
This behaviour can be explained in terms of orthopara dihydrogen conversion, catalyzed by this material. It is interesting to compare the bathochromic frequency shift observed in this material (approximately D n(HH) = 73 cm1) with those found in the case of H2 adsorbed on magnesium-exchanged Y124 and X125 faujasite-type zeolites (bathochromic shift of
D
n(HH) = 107 and 98 cm1, respectively). Clearly the magnitude of such a frequency shift depends not only on the nature of the H2 adsorbing cation, but also on its coordination sphere. Even less comparable are the values observed in the case of high surface area MgO (hsa-MgO sample in section
2.5.1) where the strong ionicity of the solid combined with
the presence of highly defective sites is associated with a much more complex chemistry. Finally, H2 adsorption at low coverage on CPO-27-Co gives rise, starting from 150 K, Fig. 7

For low coverage (0.1 H2 molecules per metal atom) they found the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) to be 10.9 kJ mol1 for the case of magnesium and 11.5 kJ mol1 for cobalt126 very similar values to those obtained by VTIR method.115

Dihydrogen on reactive oxidic surfaces: MgO and ZnO case studies Activation of the hydrogen molecule on extended surfaces of oxides is of great interest in catalysis10 e.g. hydrogenations,dehydrogenations, and hydrogen transfer reactions are known to occur on the surfaces of a-Cr2O3 and other oxides containing transition metal ions with partially filled d-shells. Solids incorporating metal ions in d10 or d0 electronic configuration (such as ZnO, or MgO) are generally less active but never- theless important, at least for fundamental investigations,because of their ability to dissociate the hydrogen molecule.
Investigations of HH bond activation on oxide surfaces are also important because of the analogies with CH bond activation, which occurs in various industrial catalytic processes.
In this respect, it has been shown that the sites responsible for H2 dissociation on MgO are also active for CH bond cleavage.127
2.5.1
The MgO/H2 system. Dissociative adsorption of dihydrogen on high surface area MgO (hsa-MgO) can be homolytic or heterolytic,10 being the homolytic splitting supposed to operate under UV-irradiation only.128130 Hetero- lytic splitting takes place in the dark and on coordinatively unsaturated (cus) Mg2+O2 surface pairs following the schematic mechanism illustrated in Scheme 1: hsa-MgO was obtained by careful decomposition of Mg(OH)2 at 523 K in vacuo,14 resulting in about 230 m2 g1 and exhibits a morphology constituted by small interpenetrated cublets as schematically reported in Fig. 8a. Samples, pressed into pellets suitable for transmission infrared measurements, were out- gassed in high vacuo at 1073 K for 2 h. On hsa-MgO, in a wide range of temperature (20300 K) and following different experimental procedures, three families of hydrides and hydroxyl groups are formed and developed differing for their vibra- tional properties and their behavior upon PH2 changes.131 For the sake of brevity we report here only the set of spectra collected at 20 K, upon lowering the pressure and the spectra will be described from low to high coverage.
At low H2 coverages (red curves), two couples of bands develop in the region of hydroxyls and hydrides respectively.
The first family is characterized by two intense and narrow IR peaks at 1325 and 3462 cm1 (see Fig. 8b), corresponding to the n(MgH) and n(OH) modes, respectively. These species are irreversible at 20 K. The fact that they are reversible at RT upon reducing PH2, suggests that the two fragments are either in adjacent positions or, if adsorbed at distant positions, able to easily migrate on the surface to recombine and give back molecular hydrogen.131134 Kno zinger et al. hypothesized that the splitting process occurs on highly unsaturated surface sites134 moreover they have molecular precursors, as demon- strated by an experiment where H2 was dosed at 20 K and spectra were collected for 1 h.131 A second family of species is characterized by a n(MgH) mode at 1125 cm1 (broad band) and by a n(OH) mode at 3712 cm1 (sharp band) and shows a higher level of stability, even at room temperature. This second family of sites has been assigned to the result of a heterolytic splitting process occurring at inverse corner sites.131,135 A couple of structures that can give rise to these species is depicted in Fig. 8a.
Moving to higher coverages (black curves) an important structured absorption in the 42004000 cm1 range is developing,testifying the adsorption of molecular hydrogen. The three complex components centered at about 41264122, 40994093 and 40814076 cm1 have been ascribed to Mg5c
2+  H2,
Mg4c 2+  H2 and Mg3c 2+  H2 molecular adducts, respec- tively. The expected ortho-para splitting (of 6 cm1) is clearly visible for the doublet at 40994093 cm1, while just results in a band broadening for the remaining two. These values are significantly downward shifted with respect to the n(HH) mode of the unperturbed H2 molecule measured in the gas phase by Raman spectroscopy:n(HH) = 4161 and 4155 cm1 for the ortho and para H2, respectively. The assignment of Gribov et al.131 thus reflects the increased weakening of the HH bond strength expected by moving from the adduct formed on a five-coordinated, Mg5c 2+ magnesium cation (regular (100) surface site), through the complex formed on a four-coordinated Mg4c 2+ cation (step site), to the adduct formed on a three coordinated Mg3c 2+ cation (corner site):
D
n(HH) B 38, 62 and 80 cm1, respectively. Interaction of CO on hsa-MgO will be discussed in section 3.3.2.
The evaluation of the intensity of the site specific IR bands upon lowering the surface coverage (y) by changing the temperature (spectra in Fig. 9a) made it possible to identify the adsorption enthalpy of the three families of sites, as reported in Fig. 9b. In all cases the intensities of the IR bands, A(T),increases gradually with decreasing T, reaching asymptotically a maximum at different T, which correspond to the saturation of Mg2+  H2 on each category of cationic sites present. The saturation allow us to know quantitatively, at any T, the fraction of sites covered by H2, defined as y(T) = A(T)/Amax,and thus the fraction of empty sites [1  y(T)]. The equilibrium constant (Kads) of the adsorption process for any given temperature can be described, under the Langmuir approxi- mation, as follow:2,14,15,17,100,131,136,137 Kads = y(T)/{[(1  y(T)] PH2} (1) Applying the Vant-Hoffequation, the angular dependence of the Ln(Kads) versus 1/T gives the adsorption energy, see Fig. 9b, showing the dependence of Ln(Kads), for each species,plotted against 1/T. In the present cases, the H2 adsorption Scheme 1 Downloaded by Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis on 19 September 2012 Published on 01 November 2010 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/C0CS00117A 4960 Chem.

A good linear correlation is observed in all the three cases,reflecting the validity of the adopted model.
2.5.2
The ZnO/H2 system. Strong polarization forces induced by acidbase couples (in this case O2 and Mg2+),are not the only way able to break heterolitically hydrogen molecules; among oxides a much more intriguing system,was found in the case of ZnO Kadox material.138 Sample pre-treatment requires activation at 773 K for 1 h under a dynamic vacuum, followed by oxygen dosage at high tempera- ture, in order to compensate oxygen lost during thermal activation. Then the sample is cooled to room temperature and oxygen outgassed to a final pressure of 104 mbar.
Electron micrographs have shown that ZnO crystallites were prevalently hexagonal single crystals, elongated along the c-axis with typical dimensions of 3060 nm wide and 150300 nm long (consistent with the measured surface area of 10 m2 g1). An example is shown in Fig. 10, that reports an HRTEM image of a ZnO microcrystal showing interferences fringes for (10 10) planes. Non-polar (10 10) prismatic faces,together with (11 20), represent about 80% of the exposed surfaces, while the remaining 20% is constituted mainly by polar surfaces (0001) and (000 1) that strongly reconstruct giving rise to kinks and steps, clearly visible in Fig. 10a (arrows evidence rounded crystal ends). Termination of (10 10) plane show Zn2+ and O2 ions arranged in pairs, having a coordinative unsaturation available, as shown in the structures reported in Fig. 10b. This specific structural arrangement has been con- sidered as the basis of the peculiar reactivity of this material towards molecular hydrogen at room temperature.139143 Fig. 10c and d reports IR spectra obtained upon progressive dihydrogen dosages: two IR adsorption bands at 3492 and at 1710 cm1, assigned to the fundamental stretching vibration of hydroxyl n(OH) and hydride n(ZnH) surface modes testify a dissociative chemisorption of the dihydrogen molecule on adjacent Zn2+O2 ion pairs, which act as a Lewis acidbase couple (see pictorial view in Fig. 10b).144,145 As the interaction is completely reversible at room temperature, large efforts have been devoted to obtain ZnO materials with high surface area, in order to exploit this behaviour in the field of materials for hydrogen storage. Unfortunately, only in the case of samples with this specific morphology, this unusual property has been observed. Once hydroxyls and hydrides are formed (probably on (10 10) faces), upon increasing PH2 and lowering the temperature down to 20 K, the coordination of molecular hydrogen occurs, as testified by the development of complex spectra in the 41604000 cm1 range, see Fig. 10e.

By lowering the temperature in the range 15053 K, a new band at 4040 cm1 grows, due to the formation of weekly bonded adducts with Zn-OH species. At very low temperature,reaching a maximum at 20 K, a complex absorption centered at 4130 cm1 indicates the formation of a condensed liquid phase of hydrogen. In the mean time all the bands at lower frequencies (40404018 cm1) undergo a red shift of about 10 cm1, testifying the effect of the formation of H2 ad-layers.

Dihydrogen spill over in Pd-containing Y-zeolite The three-dimensional framework of zeolite-Y is generated by connecting sodalite units (or b-cages, delimited by six-membered ring windows, as evidenced in Fig. 11a) through hexagonal prisms to give a structure characterized by the presence of large cavities with diameter of about 13 A (super-cages or a-cages).146 In the case of protonic Y zeolite, Al(OH)Si bridged sites can be distributed among four different locations147 protruding in the super cages (sites 1 and 4), or inside more restricted spaces, like the sodalite-cage (site 2) or the hexagonal prisms (site 3), see left part of Fig. 11a. According to neutron diffraction148 only sites 1 and 3 are significantly populated in Y zeolites and responsible for two characteristic n(OH) absorptions at 3623 cm1 (site 1) and 3550 cm1 (site 3),33,149 commonly named high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) band in the specialized literature.149 Hydroxiles associated to the LF band are generally unperturbed by probe molecules as the small aperture of sodalite cage, preclude the entrance of the probes, even as small as dihydrogen. The adsorption of increasing doses of H2 initially causes the progressive erosion of the HF component and the parallel growth of a new, slightly broader n(OH) band downward shifted of 48 cm1 (new absorption at 3603 cm1 and isosbestic point at 3630 cm1, testifying the formation 1 : 1 OH H2 adducts involving the Brnsted groups located in site 1 of the super-cages (Fig. 11b). No substantial changes are observed in the case of the LF component suggesting that the H2 molecule cannot freely penetrate the six-membered openings regulating the access to the sodalite-cage. Calculation of the potential barrier performed with accurate ab initio methods evidenced that the energy needed for a ring penetration is high: around 26 kJ mol1,independently from the molecule orientation.150 The inset of Fig. 11b reports the same spectra in the n(HH) range.

The component at 4115 cm1 was attributed to the n(HH) mode of H2 molecules involved in the 1 : 1 OH  H2 complexes formed at site 1;150 the 4125 cm1 component was assigned to the formation of Na+  H2 adducts,31 while the band at 4137 cm1 was attributed to H2 molecules unspecifically adsorbed and more weakly perturbed by interaction with the zeolite walls (vide supra).
Scarano et al.150 included Pd nanoclusters inside the Y framework (hereafter sample Pd0Y) through ion exchange with aqueous solution of [Pd(NH3)4](NO3) of a commercial NH4NaY zeolite, followed by calcination in vacuum at T = 473 K, oxidation with oxygen (P = 50 mbar) at 673 K;outgassing at 673 K; reduction with H2 at 573 K and further outgassing at the same temperature. Before performing the reduction step, Scarano et al.150 verified the effective success of the NH4 +/Pd2+ cationic exchange monitoring by IR the important decrease of the n(OH) modes, particularly the HF ones (blue dotted spectrum in Fig. 11b). A combined EXAFS and TEM (Fig. 11c) study on Pd0Y sample shows a large predominance of large particles with diameter in the 50100 A
interval, clearly located outside the zeolite pores.
Pd0Y shows Brnsted acidic sites largely restored, especially those located towards the supercage; compare blue dotted spectrum in Fig. 11b with the red curve in the left side of Fig. 11d. So Pd0Y is actually a protonic zeolite.150152 In Pd0Y the appearance of HF and LF bands are evident even if LF peak is only (1/10)th of the original indicating that the reduction process is more favored in the large super-cages than in the small sodalite and prismatic units. To verify the possibility that atomic hydrogen produced by splitting of the H2 molecule on the Pd metal particles or clusters can diffuse following spill-over effects inside the internal voids of the faujasite structure, IR spectro- scopy has been used for possible evidence of H/D exchange reactions involving the Brnsted sites of the Pd0Y zeolite. To this scope, a sample reduced at 573 K was contacted with D2 at 300 K and spectra recorded as function of the contact time (spectra in Fig. 11d) and its inset. It is possible to see that the spectrum immediately after D2 dosage (red curve) still exhibits the HF and LF absorptions, due to the n(OH) modes of protons in sites 1 and 3, with nearly unchanged intensity. After a short contact time (60 s) at 300 K the intensity of HF signal at 3645 cm1 is reduced of about 90% (blue curve) and that of the LF component at 3558 cm1 of about 50%. At the same time, two bands develop at 2688 and 2623 cm1 undoubtedly associated with n(OD) vibrations [ n(OH)/ n(OD) 1.32 and 1.36,respectively]. After 120 s, the LF component is nearly completely Fig. 11 Part (a): schematic representation the Y zeolite framework. The right part reports the whole supercage. A six-membered ring delimiting the sodalite units is evidenced in the left part, where the possible locations and the local structure of the OH groups are evidenced. Part (b): IR spectra of H2 adsorbed on HY in both the n(OH), main figure, and n(HH), inset, stretching regions. The spectral series were obtained at constant temperature (20 K) and H2 equilibrium pressure increasing from 0 (bottom red spectra) to 30 mbar (upper spectrum, full black line). The spectra in the 41604060 cm1 interval are background subtracted. Blue dotted curve reports the IR spectrum of the Pd2+-exchanged Y zeolite, before Pd reduction.

Soc. Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 4963 disappeared and the corresponding n(OD) band increased in intensity, while the residual HF band is hardly affected. The inset of Fig. 11d reports the growth of a component that can be associated to the bending mode of OD groups. All these manifestations (not occurring on Pd-free HY zeolites) are easily explained on the basis of an isotopic H/D exchange of the Si(OH)Al-acid groups, made possible by the spill-over ability of Pd metal.150,151,153 The reaction involves the Brnsted sites located inside the super-cages but also those pointing inside the hexagonal prisms: this is the clear demonstration that, unlike the molecule, atomic hydrogen can penetrate the hexagonal openings of the zeolite framework and diffuse into the sodalite- cages, as predicted by the ab initio calculations.150 It is also a matter of fact that the OH species in the super- cages are exchanged more rapidly and more efficiently by deuterium than those located in the sodalite-cages. This phenomenon can be explained on the basis of the potential barrier that atomic hydrogen (deuterium) has to overcome in order to access the cage. Scarano et al. noticed that for Pd2+Y samples reduced at 573 K the reaction exchange is very fast (being complete after only 120 s)150 as compared with other literature values: Sachtler and coworkers151 have for instance reported that on a Pd2+Y sample reduced at 673 K where the OH/OD exchange is not complete even after about 4 h of contact.

Relationship between D n(HH) and D n(CO) shifts for H2 and CO adsorption on the same sites Dihydrogen has been also extensively used for the charac- terization of Brnsted acidity of zeolites. Also in this case the interaction is mainly electrostatic in nature and shows typical
D
n(HH) values for the OH  H2 interaction in the range E70 (strongly acid RSi(OH)AlR groups in H-SSZ-13 zeolite) C E30 cm1 (weakly acid RSiOH species),154 while for H2 adsorption on extra framework Lewis sites the shifts lie in the B160 cm1 (extraframework Al3+) B 60 cm1 (alkaline cations) range.31,32 In this regard a large work has been done by Larin et al.40,41,155,156 to provide theoretical models able to understand the D n(HH) values for the M+  H2 adducts formed inside zeolitic frameworks.
For electrostatic-type interactions, when comparison is made with the spectroscopic data concerning adsorption on the same sites of the much more popular CO probe (vide infra section 3), it is found that the shifts of the n(CO) and n(HH) frequencies are linearly correlated and that and D n(HH) E 2D n(CO). This is due to the fact that the
n(HH) of the single HH bond is more sensitive than the
n(CO) of the triple CRO bond to local effects (like struc- ture, number of ligands in the coordination sphere, etc.) possibly influencing the physicochemical properties of the adsorbing centres32 (vide infra). The data reported in Fig. 12 clearly show that the relationship is verified for a number of systems including SiO2, acidic and exchanged zeolites,oxides, etc. It is, on the contrary, noteworthy the relevant scatter of the points corresponding to Cr2+ species grafted on Silica,a system where covalent contributions play a certain role in both the Cr2+  CO and Cr2+  H2 interaction.157

Classical and non-classical metal carbonyls, a brief overview The literature on metal carbonyls is enormous and several reviews have already been devoted to this subject.5,10,158165 The way CO interacts with metal cations may involve different contributions, according to the nature of the metal-cations sites. (a) The electric field created by a positive charge (like for instance an alkaline metal cation) causes a polarization of the CO molecule which depends on the local electric field of the site,i.e. on the charge density of the cation mainly, modulated by the neighbor anions.166172 The spectroscopic evidence of the polari- zation of the CO molecule is an upwards shift (blue-shift) of the stretching frequency of the CO bond with respect to the n(CO) of the gas (2143 cm1),173 owing to the increase of the force constant of the CO bond, and the decrease of the bond length.159162,167169 (b) In the presence of an acceptor of electron pairs, such as a metal cation possessing empty orbitals of suitable energy (and thus acting as Lewis acidic center) the C-end lone pair of CO is transferred to the metal cation giving rise to a s-coordination (Mn+  CO). In this case too, the interaction between CO and the metal cation causes the n(CO) stretching frequency to shift towards a value higher than that of the gas. It is generally accepted that the higher the blue-shift, the stronger the interaction, according to the Lewis acidic strength of the metal site.5,159163,167172,174 (c) In the case of transition metal cations possessing partially filled d orbitals, a significant Mn+ - CO p-donation can occur from the orbitals of the d-block metal back to the orbitals of the CO molecule. The increase of the electronic density in the anti-bonding orbitals of Fig. 12 Plot of the shifts D n(HH) for H2 adsorbed on the Lewis or Brnsted acid sites of zeolitic and oxidic materials vs. the corresponding shifts observed for CO: D n(CO). Circled data are taken from Zecchina et al.32 Triangles refer to the Cr2+/SiO2 system (Phillips catalyst).157 The data concerning the Fe-Sil Lewis acid sites are represented by filled squares (D n(CO) values taken from Berlier et al.:87 A and A0 refer to Fe3+ centres, B and B0 to Fe2+); those concerning the Brnsted sites by filled circles. The region delimited by the greyed region corresponds to H2 and CO interaction mechanisms prevalently dominated by electrostatic forces.

Rev., 2010, 39, 49515001 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010 the CO molecule causes the force constant of the CO bond to decrease, the CO bond length to increase and thus the n(CO) to be red-shifted with respect that of the gas. The strength of the bond between CO and the d-block metal cations, and the nCO stretching frequency, are not expected in such a case to be simply correlated. In fact, as far as the strength of the carbonyl bond increases, as a consequence of the synergistic effect of the s-(Mn+  CO) and p-(Mn+ - CO) components, the resulting nCO is located in a spectral position which is a com- promise of a blue- and a red-shifts,159163,174180 In the case of a simple polarization due to the electric field generated by a coordinatively unsaturated cation (as described in point i), as well as in the case of either non d or d0 metal cations involving a plain s-coordination (as described in point ii), a correlation does exist between the blue-shift of the stretching frequency (D nCO) and the adsorption enthalpy DadsH, vide infra Fig. 16c. A wide literature concerning a number of coordinatively unsaturated metal cations either exposed at the surface of oxides, or dispersed as charge- balancing cations in zeolites confirms this relationship.10,174,181 It is worth noting that the bonding features of such metal carbonyl species formed in heterogeneous conditions match with the definition of non classical metal carbonyls, reported in ref. 159163 and 174 for complexes formed in homogeneous conditions. Indeed, for the species categorized as non classical metal carbonyls the basic classical metal carbonyls state- ment n(CO) must be lower than 2143 cm1 does not apply.
Summarizing, for CO ligands bound to d-metal cations,the experimentally observed n(CO) gives an indication of the relative contribution of the different components. In the classical metal carbonyls the effect described in (iii) prevails,whereas in the non classical carbonyls the effects described in (i) and (ii) are predominant.

CO on alkalimetal exchanged zeolites: Pure electro- static interaction. The close shell configuration of all alkali metal cations M+ makes them ideal probing sites for a pure electrostatic interaction. In such a case, the perturbation of the CO stretching frequency is proportional to the local electric field strength (E) according to the Stark effect:169

This linear correlation between D n(CO) and d2 MCO is clearly appreciable from the data reported in Fig. 14.
