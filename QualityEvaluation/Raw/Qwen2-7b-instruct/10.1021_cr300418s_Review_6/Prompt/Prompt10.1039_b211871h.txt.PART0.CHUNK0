Modelling spin-forbidden reactions: recombination of carbon monoxide with iron tetracarbonyl Jeremy N. Harvey*a and Massimiliano Aschib a School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Cantocks Close, Bristol, UK BS8 1TS.

Careful exploration of basis set and correlation effects leads to best values for the difference in energy DE(1,3) between ground state 3[Fe(CO)4] and the singlet excited state of ca. 8 kcal mol1, and for the bond dissociation energy BDE(3) of [Fe(CO)5] with respect to ground state fragments 3[Fe(CO)4] + CO of ca. 40 kcal mol1. A modified form of the B3PW91 functional is used to explore the potential energy surface for the spin- forbidden recombination reaction of CO with 3[Fe(CO)4]. A Cs-symmetric minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the reactant (triplet) and product (singlet) potential energy surfaces is found, lying 0.43 kcal mol1 above the reactants. The rate coefficient for recombination is computed using a non-adiabatic form of transition state theory, in which the MECP is treated as the critical point in the reaction. Semi-quantitative agreement with experiment is obtained: the predicted rate coefficient, 8.8  1015 cm3 molecule1 s1, is only six times smaller than the experimental rate. This is the first computation from first principles of a rate coefficient for a spin-forbidden reaction of a transition metal compound.
Introduction As well as the many synthetic applications of [Fe(CO)5] as a (very) fundamental building block for organometallic compounds of iron, it has been the subject of a great many investigations using the methods of physical chemistry and of physical organometallic chemistry, aimed at understanding the fundamental aspects of its chemistry.1,2 This is no doubt in part due to its modest size, ready availability and significant vapour pressure. Another factor is surely that for such a small molecule,its chemistry encompasses a surprisingly broad range of principles and reaction types. For example,the reaction which forms the topic of the present paper, i.e. gas-phase recombination of CO with the [Fe(CO)4] fragment to regenerate iron pentacarbonyl, is in many respects an archetypal ligand addition reaction to an unsaturated species. Therefore, the theoretical study in this paper should be of broader interest to computational and experimental transition metal chemists.
Our particular focus of interest here is a set of experiments carried out in the Weitz group.3,4 In this work, [Fe(CO)5] or some other stable organometallic is photodissociated in a flow tube using UV light, and the time-evolution of the fragments is monitored by transient infrared spectroscopy.
In the presence of ligands such as CO, N2 or C2H4 in the backing gas, these can then react with fragments such as [Fe(CO)4] to generate the corresponding saturated species. Many recombination

Reaction (1) is an example of such a very fast recombination process whose rate has been measured by Weitz et al.3 The homologous reaction (2) is very different, as it occurs roughly 400 times slower than (1). The authors explained this observation based on the spin-conserving nature of these two reactions. It is well established, both from computation (see below) and experiment that the unsaturated [Fe(CO)3] and [Fe(CO)4] species have spin triplet ground states. Reaction (1) is thereby spin- allowed. [Fe(CO)5], which has 18 electrons, is of course a singlet. Therefore, reaction (2) is spin- forbidden, and this may account for its slow rate. Similar slow rates have been observed for related spin-forbidden reactions.4 FeCO3  CO ! FeCO4 k  2:2  1011 cm3 s1 molecule1 1 FeCO4  CO ! FeCO5 k  5:2  1014 cm3 s1 molecule1 2 There have been a large number of computational and theoretical papers concerning the chemistry of [Fe(CO)5]. The bond energies have been addressed by various groups, using ab initio5 and density functional methods.6 Potential energy curves relevant to the photodissociation of [Fe(CO)5] have also been computed,7 and several studies have attempted to account for some of the reactivity issues discussed here.2c,6c,d However, these have not been able to provide quantitative insight into reaction rates, which is the aim of the present study. Also, some of the computed properties vary considerably from one level of theory to another, and the lack of accurate experimental data means that there are still considerable uncertainties about the correct value of these observables, in particular the singlet/triplet energy splitting and the bond energy.
The spin-forbidden character of recombination reaction (2) makes its computational study highly challenging. In the limit of very strong spinorbit coupling, spin-forbidden reactions are in principle no more complex than other reactions: As the system evolves from reactant to product,coupling between the different spin states will lead to the overall wavefunction smoothly changing its spin character, from being e.g. mainly triplet in nature to mainly singlet. However, even in such cases, the computational challenge is severe, as most electronic structure codes do not include the spinorbit coupling part of the Hamiltonian, so that only pure spin states can be addressed, and the correct adiabatic potential energy surfaces can therefore not be readily obtained.
In fact, as we shall see below, the [Fe(CO)4 ,CO] system is not at the strong coupling limit, so that this system is inherently non-adiabatic. This means that dynamics will tend to evolve mainly on zeroth-order potential energy surfaces, of defined spin, with transfer between surfaces occurring,with a probability dependent on the strength of spinorbit coupling, in the regions where these diabatic surfaces cross or at least lie very close in energy. Although this makes the treatment of the dynamics more complex, it does mean that traditional computational methods can be used to compute the energy of the different electronic states. It is however necessary to locate the important regions of the potential energy surfaces where the relevant spin states lie close in energy. In most cases, these surfaces actually cross, and the problem is reduced to finding the crossing points. One approach for finding such points treats the system in a pseudo-one-dimensional way, in which each surface is mapped out for several values of a given reaction coordinate, usually a bond length or angle. The crossing point between the resulting one-dimensional curves is a rough approximation to the lowest energy crossing point between the surfaces. However, it is usually more accurate, and faster, to use a gradient-based method to explicitly locate the exact minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the surfaces. Several algorithms to do this have been proposed in the literature.8,9 We10 and others11 have shown how the energy and geometry of MECPs (or more generally of crossing points) can be used to provide a qualitative estimate of the rate of spin-forbidden reac- tions. Most relevant to the present work, we have carried out a number of studies of spin-forbidden processes in transition metal chemistry, including both organometallic12 and bioinorganic13 reactions.14,15 For more precise estimates of rate coefficients, one must either resort to non-adiabatic dynamical studies, or to non-adiabatic statistical rate theories. The latter basically involve using a multi- plicative transmission factor, related to the spinorbit coupling strength, to correct the rate computed using standard transition state theory, treating, where appropriate, the MECP like the 130 Faraday Discuss., 2003, 124, 129143 Downloaded by University of Virginia on 08 August 2012 Published on 25 April 2003 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B211871H View Online transition state of adiabatic statistical methods. Such methods have already been applied to a number of small gas-phase reactions,1618 but not, at least as far as we are aware, to transition metal chemistry.
In the present study, we aim to calculate the rate coefficient for addition of CO to triplet [Fe(CO)4] using non-adiabatic transition state theory (NA-TST). We will start by presenting the NA-TST method used here, which is based on the unimolecular method of ref. 16, as already used by us in conjunction with MECPs.18 We will also explain how the different pieces of input needed for this study, in particular the properties of the MECP, can be derived from computation. Then,we will present the technical computational details relating to our calculations. As usual when applying statistical rate theories, it is extremely important to obtain accurate estimates of the barrier height, here the energy of the MECP. As mentioned above, the correct splitting between singlet and triplet states and the bond energy are not very well known. Accordingly, we have carried out a large number of computations aimed at elucidating these questions, as well as characterising the reactants and MECP, and we will next present these results. Finally, we shall present our computed rates for the title reaction, compare these to experiment, and discuss the implications for other spin-forbidden reactions.
Non-adiabatic transition state theory (NA-TST) The reaction of interest in the present study is in some respects of the most simple type possible for a spin-forbidden bimolecular reaction, as illustrated by the schematic potential energy surfaces of Fig. 1. There is only one step, corresponding to the spin-crossing or MECP. The addition is suf- ficiently exothermic, the size of the molecule large enough, and the pressure of the experiments to be modelled3 high enough that only the forward reaction needs to be taken into account, with collisional cooling certain to occur faster than reverse dissociation. Also, there are no intermediate species involved. Singlet [Fe(CO)4] lies too high in energy to play a significant role in the kinetics at room temperature. Finally, the seam of crossing around the MECP, even though the latter is low- lying (see below), is certain to represent a clear dividing surface between reactant and product configurations so that variational effects are not expected to be important.
For all these reasons, the rate coefficient can be written in the following relatively simple way:kT 1 hQRT

1 0 NMECPEeE=kBT dE In this equation, h is Plancks constant, QR(T ) is the reactant partition function, including electronic, vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom for both reactants 3[Fe(CO)4] and CO, as well as the relative translational motion. NMECP(E) is an effective number of states (or integrated Fig. 1 Schematic potential energy surfaces for the [Fe(CO)5] system.Faraday Discuss., 2003, 124, 129143 131 Downloaded by University of Virginia on 08 August 2012 Published on 25 April 2003 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B211871H View Online density of states) at the MECP for a given energy E relative to the zero-point level of the reactants,and kB is Boltzmanns constant. This equation is identical to that used in normal transition state theory, except concerning the expression used for the number of states, which is given here as:
NMECPE
ZE
0 rMECPE  EHpSHEHdEH As can be seen, this equation involves a second integration, over EH , which is the part of the total energy E which is in the coordinate orthogonal to the seam of crossing between the two surfaces. For each value of this energy, the contribution to the integrated sum of states NMECP(E) is obtained as a product of the density of states within the crossing seam rMECP(E  EH), and a probability for hopping from one surface to the other, pSH(EH). The first of these terms is similar to the traditional density of states term used within the dividing surface around a saddle-point: the crossing seam defines a sub-space within which the available energy E  EH may be distributed in many different ways amongst the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. The term pSH corresponds in fact to the sum of the probabilities for hopping from one surface to another upon approaching the seam from below, and of that for hopping upon recrossing the seam in the other direction. To a first approximation, this term depends only on EH , and can be calculated in a pseudo-one-dimensional way using either LandauZener theory or from WKB theory (using an expression given by Delos and Thorson).16,19 The general LandauZener surface-hopping probability is given by:pLandauZener

where (1  P) is the probability of hopping on the first passage, and P(1  P) the probability for (a) not hopping on first crossing the seam, then (b) hopping upon crossing it again in the reverse direction, and their sum gives pSH . In this expression, V12 is the electronic matrix element for coupling between the two surfaces (which is due to spinorbit coupling in our case), mH is the reduced mass for movement along the direction orthogonal to the crossing seam, and DF is the norm of the difference of the gradients on the two surfaces.

The advantage of this second expression is that it is not equal to zero for E below the crossing point,although it does decrease rapidly in this regime. This allows for tunnelling from one surface to the other below the crossing point.
The data needed to apply this theory are a set of properties of the two reactants and of the
MECP. For the reactants, all that is needed is the geometry (and hence the rotational constants)
and vibrational frequencies of CO and 3[Fe(CO)4]. For the MECP, one needs its energy relative to the reactants, its geometry, the vibrational frequencies within the seam of crossing needed to compute rMECP(E), the reduced mass along the reaction coordinate, the norm of the difference in gradients on the two surfaces, and their geometric mean, as well as the root mean square spinorbit coupling matrix element V12 between the singlet and triplet wavefunctions. These properties will be 132 Faraday Discuss., 2003, 124, 129143 Downloaded by University of Virginia on 08 August 2012 Published on 25 April 2003 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B211871H View Online calculated at the levels of theory described below. The methods needed to locate and characterize the MECP have been described before.9,18,20 Briefly, a script program has been developed which:(a) generates suitable input files for an electronic structure code; (b) calls the code; (c) extracts from the output the energies and gradients on the two surfaces; (d) combines these to yield an effective gradient which is directed towards the MECP; (e) uses this to update the geometry until con- vergence to the MECP is reached.
Computational details The bulk of the density functional theory computations have been carried out using the Gaussian program,21 with a flexible, triple-zeta basis set. Specifically, the all-electron basis sets of Ahlrichs et al.22 are used, as implemented in Gaussian. These are segmented contractions of the form (17s9p6d)/[6s3p3d] for Fe and (11s6p)/[5s3p] for C and O. A set of two diffuse, uncontracted 4p- like functions23 was added to the Fe basis (a  0.134915 and 0.041843), as well as one f polar- isation function (a  1.0) on iron, and one d function each on C and O (a  0.8 and 1.2,respectively). Test calculations using larger basis sets (e.g. VQZ-VTZ below) led to very similar results, so we assume the present basis to be more or less converged in size for DFT computations.
Where required, this basis is simply referred to as TZV. Full geometry optimisation was carried out for all species. Some DFT computations were also carried out using the MOLPRO 2002.3 code,24 with the same TZV basis.
All ab initio computations were carried out using MOLPRO 2002.3 using a variety of methods and basis sets. MCSCF and internally-contracted multi-reference perturbation theory25 (CASPT2 for short) calculations were carried out using a variety of active spaces, as discussed in the text. The MCSCF calculations included all configurations for the chosen active space and wavefunction symmetry (CASSCF computations). For the CASPT2 calculations, typically only the configura- tions with a weight in the CASSCF wavefunction exceeding a certain threshold (0.001 to 0.01) were included in the reference wavefunction. In all cases, these configurations made up more than 99.9% of the CASSCF wavefunction by weight, and convergence tests were carried out to make sure the threshold was small enough. To compute bond energies, single-reference MP2 energies for CO were used in conjunction with CASPT2 energies for [Fe(CO)4] and [Fe(CO)5] (see discussion below).
Also in the CASPT2 calculations, a level shift, typically of 0.3 au, was applied to the virtual orbitals so as to avoid intruder state problems.26 In the absence of the level shift, catastrophic con- vergence problems were sometimes observed. Single-reference CCSD and CCSD(T) computations were also carried out.27 As discussed in the text, it was found that using density functional theory orbitals to expand the CCSD wavefunction led to improved performance in some cases. In all correlated calculations, the core Fe (1s2s2p3s3p) and C and O (1s) orbitals were held frozen.
The basis sets used for these ab initio computations covered a broad range of sizes. We will refer to these basis sets using labels such as double-zeta (DZ) which loosely describe their size. In detail, the DZ basis used the same basis from ref. 22 on the Fe atom, without additional p or f functions, and the cc-pVDZ basis of Dunning28 on C and O, but without the d polarisation functions. The VDZ basis adds the two diffuse p functions and the f function mentioned above on Fe, and uses the full cc-pVDZ basis on C and O. The VTZ-VDZ basis adds an extra d function (a  0.134915) on Fe, and replaces the single f function with a [2f1g] set (af  3.265953,
0.786787, ag  2.248) taken from the VTZ correlation-consistent iron basis sets of Ricca and
Bauschlicher.29 The VQZ-VDZ basis expands this basis set by uncontracting the most diffuse primitive d function in the contraction scheme, replacing the diffuse a  0.134915 d function by a set of two (a  0.12, 0.05), and using a larger [3f2g1h] polarisation set (af  5.138777, 1.51900,
0.44901, ag  3.705809, 1.011411, ah  2.48) also taken from ref. 29. This leads to a final basis of
(17s12p8d3f2g1h)/[6s5p6d3f2g1h] size. Finally, the VTZ and VQZ-VTZ bases use the same Fe bases as the VTZ-VDZ and VQZ-VDZ sets, but with the larger cc-pVTZ basis28 on C and O. To test for possible relativistic effects, some CCSD(T) calculations were repeated using relativistic (DouglasKroll) one-electron integrals,30 as implemented in MOLPRO. Negligible changes in relative energetics were obtained.
For the NA-TST computations, MECPs were optimised using the code developed by one of us,9,18,20 and the frequencies within the seam of crossing were also computed as described.9,18 Faraday Discuss., 2003, 124, 129143 133 Downloaded by University of Virginia on 08 August 2012 Published on 25 April 2003 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B211871H View Online Vibrational densities of state within the harmonic approximation were computed using the steepest descent method.31 The spinorbit coupling between singlet and triplet states was computed at the geometry of the 3[Fe(CO)4] minimum, and at the geometry of the MECP determined at the B3PW91/TZV level, using the full BreitPauli Hamiltonian, as implemented in MOLPRO,32 using state-averaged CASSCF wavefunctions, and the large, 12 electrons in 12 orbitals active space described below. The basis set used was a variation on the VDZ basis described above: The Fe basis was the same, but the cc-pVDZ basis, whose general contraction pattern cannot be treated by the spinorbit integral routine, was replaced by the double-zeta basis of ref. 22 for C and O, with one d function in each case (aC  0.55, aO  1.185).
Results: DFT and ab initio calculations In previous studies of spin-forbidden reactions of transition metal compounds, we have used standard density functional theory,33 e.g. using the well established hybrid B3LYP functional, to compute the necessary points on the potential energy surfaces.1214 Based on this and other pre- vious experience, this functional should yield reasonable, qualitatively accurate potential energy surfaces. It is well known, however, that rate calculations require very accurate potential energy surfaces, as properties such as the barrier height have a very large influence on computed rate coefficients. In the present case, we are attempting to reproduce a difference between rate coeffi- cients of roughly 500: this corresponds to an approximate difference in barrier heights of less than 4 kcal mol1, so our results need to be significantly more accurate than this, at least for the barrier height. As can be seen from Fig. 1, this also requires the computed singlettriplet energy separation DE(1,3) to be well reproduced.
To test whether DFT was capable of providing this level of accuracy for the present system, we first of all computed the key energetics using a variety of different functionals. This often provides a useful informal check as to the overall accuracy of DFT approaches:33 when large differences are observed between functionals, great care should be taken to ascertain which is most reliable. Our DFT results for the [Fe,(CO)5] system are summarised in Table 1.
It is to be noted first of all that the computed geometries for the different species are found to be very similar with all the functionals. [Fe(CO)5] has a D3h trigonal bipyramid structure with two axial and three equatorial ligands. Both singlet and triplet [Fe(CO)4] have C2v minima, which are best described as truncated forms of the parent pentacarbonyl species, in which one of the equa- torial ligands has been removed, and some relaxation of the axial ligands towards the vacant site Table 1 Computed energetics of the [Fe(CO)5] system (in kcal mol1) using a variety of different functionals, and the TZV basis.

The details of these geometries have been discussed exhaustively in previous studies.5,6 Turning to the energies, the agreement between functionals is much less good. Thus, the pre- dicted DE(1,3) ranges from slightly negative values to as large as 20 kcal mol1. This too is in line with previous observations.6 By and large, the results do all follow one general trend, whereby the splitting increases upon inclusion of gradient corrections and especially of exact, HartreeFock exchange. Thus, the LDA gives a singlet ground state, whereas gradient-corrected pure density functionals such as the standard BP86 and BLYP, as well as the newer G96LYP34 and HCTH14735 give very small state splittings. Standard hybrid functionals such as B3LYP and B3PW91, which are based on Beckes 3-parameter fit to the G2 set of compounds36 (and include 20% exact exchange), or the newer, B1LYP,37 mPW1PW91,38 and PBE039 functionals, where the proportion is slightly larger, at 25%, all give values of the order of 10 kcal mol1. Functionals such as KMLYP40 or MPW1K,41 which have been developed mainly so as to reproduce more accurately certain activation barriers for simple hydrogen abstraction reactions, include a very large amount of exact exchange, and yield very large DE(1,3) values. As will be discussed below, these are cer- tainly incorrect, which confirms that functionals of this type, whilst valuable in the context for which they have been developed, are certainly not of general applicability.
The above observations are in fact not really new: previous calculations with the B3LYP functional give values very close to that in Table 1, and pure functionals have been found to give the same sort of small splitting obtained here.6 The dependence on the amount of exact exchange has also been observed more generally for the splitting between high- and low-spin states of metal compounds.42 In fact, Reiher et al. have found energy splittings to depend almost linearly on the proportion of exact exchange for a set of Fe(II) and other complexes, and they have found that a modified form of the B3LYP functional, with 15% exchange (instead of 20%), often gives the best agreement with experiment for these and other compounds.43 We have reproduced a similar result for the energy splitting between singlet and triplet [Fe(CO)4], computed at the B3LYP optimised geometries, with modified forms of B3LYP with different values of the c3 coefficient for admixture of exact exchange. This splitting (uncorrected for ZPE, and with the version of B3LYP as installed in MOLPRO, which differs slightly from that installed in Gaussian) varies almost linearly from 2.20 kcal mol1 for c3  0.0 to 7.44 kcal mol1 for c3  0.20 (i.e. the normal B3LYP functional) to 21.03 kcal mol1 with c3  0.50. As explained further below, we believe that the modified B3PW91 functional, with c3  0.15 as suggested by Reiher et al.,43 gives the best result, and this is also shown in Table 1. Following their notation, we refer to this as B3PW91*.
Results for c3  0.10 (B3PW91**) are also shown.
It is to be noted that the bond energies also vary significantly from one functional to another. We include in Table 1 dissociation energies referenced not only to the triplet ground state (which we call BDE(3)), but also those (BDE(1)) referenced to the excited singlet fragment, which has an electronic structure more similar to that of the [Fe(CO)5] molecule. The latter intrinsic bond energies vary less strongly than the former, as these in effect also depend indirectly on DE(1,3).
Nevertheless, the choice of the correlation functional, especially, does affect the computed BDE(1),with the LYP functional giving noticeably smaller values.
Clearly, a reliable set of calibration data is necessary. Unfortunately, there is not much experimental data for this system, and it is not very accurate. DE(1,3) is known to be positive, so that [Fe(CO)4] has a triplet ground state.1 However, the fact that even rather weak ligands, such as methane and xenon, form singlet adducts which are stable at low temperature in matrices, suggests that the energy splitting between the two states cannot be very large. Concerning the bond energy,the most reliable determination44 is fairly accurate, at 41  2 kcal mol1, but there is some uncertainty as to whether it refers to BDE(1) or to BDE(3). This point is discussed lower down.
Instead, then, we sought to calibrate our computations using traditional ab initio computations,using both single- and multi-reference methods. These results are summarised in Tables 2 and 3. In principle, multi-reference methods should be the most accurate, given the known tendency of transition metal compounds to display multi-configurational character, and so we therefore started with these methods. As always in such cases, the most difficult choice to make is that of the

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
