Band theory and Mott insulators: Hubbard U instead of Stoner I Vladimir I. Anisimov, Jan Zaanen,and Ole K. Andersen Max Pla-nck Ins-titut fu'r Festkorperforschung, D 70-00 Stuttgart 80, Heisenbergstrasse 1, Federal Republic of Germany (Received 4 September 1990; revised manuscript received 5 March 1991) We propose a form for the exchange-correlation potential in local-density band theory,appropriate for Mott insulators.
The idea is to use the "constrained-local-density-approximation" Hubbard parame- ter U as the quantity relating the single-particle potentials to the magnetic- (and orbital-) order parame- ters. Our energy functional is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation to the remaining part of the U term.
We argue that such a method should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations.
Us- ing this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides,as well as the parent com- pounds of the high-T,compounds,are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type.
Fur- ther, the method predicts that LiNiO2 is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS a local-moment p-type metal.
The present version of the scheme fails for the early-3d-transition-metal monoxides and for the late 3d transition metals.
I. IS THK LSDA RKPAIRABLEY
Despite the many successes of local- (spin-) density- approximation [L(S)DA] band theory,it is often claimed that this method is useless for strongly correlated materi- als. This criticism relates in the first place to the failure of LSDA to give a proper description of Mott insulators like the 3d-transition-metal oxides.
Although the method reproduces the ground-state magnetic structure in the series NiO MnO, it predicts CoO and FeO to be metals,while in reality they are insulators with well-developed correlation gaps, and the LSDA gives gaps in NiO and MnO which are too small by an order of magnitude. ' One could then defend the LSDA by claiming that the method is not meant for excited-state properties.Howev- er, the ground state also is not properly described.The local moments tend to be too small and, moreover,in rel- atively covalent materials like the high- T,cuprates (among others) the magnetism vanishes altogether in LSDA, while in reality they are still rather strong antifer- romagnets.It is generally accepted that strongly correlated sys- tems are quite well described by the multiband Hubbard or Anderson-lattice type of models.The essential as- sumption in these models is that the strongly correlated d or f electrons (describable in a tight-binding single- particle basis) are subject to on-site quasiatomic interac- tions.The most important of these is the Hubbard pa- rameter U, defined as U =E(d"+')+E(d" ') 2E(d"),i.e., the Coulomb-energy cost to place two electrons at the same site. In these strong-correlation models, one ac- counts only for a limited subset of all electronic degrees of freedom.
This is rationalized by arguing that the other degrees of freedom (like metal d-s, ligand p stransitions,- etc.) are fast compared to the fluctuations involving the d or f electrons.
The former can therefore be integrated out,leading to a renormalization ("screening") of the model parameters,compared to their atomic counter- parts.
One can use the LDA to calculate these model parameters.
As a first step, one represents the d electrons in an orthonormal atomiclike basis to enable the identification with the single-particle basis of the model,which can be done using, e.g., the basis of orthonormal linear muSn-tin orbitals [LMTO's].By applying a variety of constraints,one can find the model parameters.For instance, ' in order to calculate the screened U, one removes the transfer integrals between the d orbitals and the rest of the system and the occupancy of the d orbitals is varied (6nd ), while the other electrons are allowed to relax self-consistently,and it follows that U=5 E,/5nd,where Eis the LDA total energy.It turns out, that for a variety of strongly correlated systems (rare-earth com- pounds, " 3d-transition-metal Mott insulators' and im- purity systems, ' high-T,superconductors' ' ),this LDA-parameters-Hubbard-model approach is surprising- ly accurate.One thus faces a paradox.On the one hand, the stan- dard LSDA is unfit for the description of magnetic insu- lators.On the other hand,all the "correct" information is apparently there.
The purpose of this paper is to point out that the results of constrained-LDA calculations can be implemented in the standard LDA framework,result- ing in a parameter-free,approximate "band" theory for Mott insulators.
For this purpose,we have to abandon the conventional homogeneous-electron-gas framework.
To engineer another energy functional,we find inspira- tion in the success of the "band approach" to Hubbard- type models.
LSDA is structured like a weak-coupling mean-field (MF) theory.
It is implicitly assumed that the interac- tions (like the Hubbard parameter U) are small com- pared to the bandwidth ( W), although in Mott insulators this is obviously not the case. However,due to the work of Brandow' and others,it is nowadays common 1991 The American Physical Society

knowledge' that MF theory can also make sense for large couplings,in particular at half-filling.Consider the simple case of a system, characterized by a single band of correlated ("d") electrons,subjected to a Hubbard-type interaction: Hi = g Und, tnd;),where nd,- is the number operator of the d electron at site i with spin o.. In MF theory, the fluctuations around the average occupancies ((n, )) are neglected and Eq. (2) is approximated as
H, "=,
' g Ut'n;(n;&+n;i ) m;(n;& n;t)]
,'U(n;m, ),defining the average occupancy and moment as n, =(n, &)+(n, ) ) and m, =(n;&) (n, ) ), respectively.Let us now consider the case that U)) Wand n;+ I (in- tegral valency).The paramagnetic
MF
ground state would be at much too high energy (= U/4).
However,upon the complete spin polarization (m, 1), the ground-state energy drops to -0. The d band is split into an occupied and unoccupied part located at
U/2
and U/2, respectively,and the system is characterized by a gap
U.
The lowest-order hybridization correction yields the correct expression for Anderson's superex- change, ' i.e., for the single-band Hubbard model on a square lattice the energy difference between the antiferro- magnetic and ferromagnetic MF solutions is z(2t /U).The only remaining problem is that MF maps on a classi- cal (instead of a quantum) Heisenberg spin system.As Schrieffer et al. showed recently, ' this is easily cured by including random-phase-approximation
(RPA)
fluctua- tions.
We have thus made the observation that MF theory works quite well, not only for U 8' but also in the ex- tremely localized limit (U/W))1, n;1), at least at half-filling.This has a good reason: In the spin-polarized solution the probability that a "wrong-spin" electron enters a "right-spin" site approaches zero if m;1, so that double occupancy is projected out automatically.
Because the extreme limits are well treated,one expects that MF theory should also work reasonably well in in- termediate cases, although this does not mean that it is "exact" in any sense.
Here the problems become more significant,because one can no longer profit from the complete spin polarization.
This is particularly clear in multiband situations,where the electrons can redistribute themselves over the unit cell.
In, e.g., transition-metal oxides (TMO), the electrons can delocalize onto the oxy- gens,and this covalency is controlled by the charge- transfer energy (or p-d splitting) 5 versus the p-d hopping t d. ' ' Comparison with Gutzwiller- approximation results (which are excellent for local prop- erties ) shows that the polarized MF solutions tend to overestimate the degree of localization.On the other hand,on a somewhat cruder level, the MF solutions are sound.If U & 5, one finds charge-transfer insulators (instead of the classical Mott-Hubbard insulators for U) b. ), one finds mean-field analogs ' of the Zhang- Rice singlets,' etc. Away from half-filling,things are less well settled.The least one can say is that MF solu- tions can be quite suggestive as exemplified by the recent discovery of charged-domain-wall solutions in the con- text of doped Mott-Hubbard insulators. ' Alternative- ly, for truly hard cases like the itinerant-electron mag- nets, MF results are a necessary input.If the MF character of the LSDA is not the problem,what then has gone wrong?The problem is that in the LSDA the localization is not controlled by U but, rather,by a quantity which represents the Hund's rule exchange,the "Stoner parameter I". The LSDA total energy can be written in the form ELsD =E In(r)I+E, In T(r), nl(r)I
ELDA
I (r) I where E" is the energy of the nonmagnetic state,which is a functional of the charge distribution In(r)I,and E is the exchange-correlation energy which de- pends on the spin distribution.
The exchange splitting is in general a function of the magnetization m(r),gE LSDA gE LSDA Vt
V& =
=f(r)m(r) .
(5) For small magnetization the exchange splitting is in- dependent of k, and we can write (g"f(r)m(r) P,")
mI .
It turns out that in 3d-transition-metal systems the Ston- er parameter I is rather independent of crystal structure,magnetization,etc., and it is therefore characteristic for the 3d-transition-metal atom itself, rejecting the tight- binding character of the 3d electrons.
In the isolated atom, the same quantity controls the spin splittings.
Un- der the assumption that the LSDA reproduces the ener- gies of single-determinant states,' one obtains an accu- rate description of the atomic term splittings.In other words, the LSDA Stoner parameter I has to be identified with the Hund's-rule exchange.The Hund's-rule ex- change parameter (J) is typically of order 1 eV and the Hubbard parameter U is of order 10 eV. We have thus identified the main LSDA problem. ' ' In the homo- geneous electron gas, the spin dependence has its physical origin in the Hund s-rule exchange,while in Mott insula- tors the Hubbard parameter U is responsible,and the latter is an order of magnitude larger than the former.In the model MF approach it is easy to account for the orbital degeneracy of the d or f bands. ' ' ' ' ' In a spin- and orbital-degenerate system, the Hubbard term is written as (neglecting,for the moment, Hund's-rule ex- change) Hi= ,

where v=(m, o ) labels collectively both the orbital (m ) and the spin (o ). Focusing again on the atomic limit U)) 8' the paramagnetic MF ground state would as usual be energetically quite unfavorable

Neglecting single-particle (ligand-field) split- tings, the occupancy of every orbital in a given spin chan- nel is the same (n/N if n (N and 1 for the majority channel,and ( n
N )/N
for the minority channel if N  n  2N ).
The

energy is therefore = ,

' U(1
I/N)n + U(n N) i f n  N. Because the Slater gap is now only between states of different spin,one finds metals (or single-particle gap insulators),except for the half-filled shell.
This is the reason why conventional LSDA calcu- lations predict FeO or CoO to be metallic. ' Usually,one spheridizes the atomic charge densities in practical calcu- lations [atomic-spheres approximation
(ASA)].
In this case, the Hartree and exchange-correlation (xc ) poten- tials see the average charge density,and only spin polar- ization can enter.
However,if one accounts for the non- spherical nature of the atom, the Hartree and xc poten- tials will become orbital dependent,and this can cure the metallicity problem to some extent.
These correction terms are rather small (b.J-0.1 eV), and as Norman recently showed,they hardly change the outcomes for FeO and CoO.
The problem is again that Hund's-rule couplings are made responsible.In our Hubbard-U inter- pretation,however,spins and orbitals appear essentially on the same footing in the Hamiltonian,insofar as the in- teractions are concerned [Eq. (7)]. The best MF solution of Eq. (7) in the localized limit is obtained by occupying n specific orbitals on every atom,and the ground-state en- ergy is then of order = U"'" "/2. These occupied orbit- als are separated by a gap = U from the unoccupied ones,and all stoichiometric systems are therefore large-gap in- sulators. ' The somewhat unusual aspect is that, besides the spins, the atomic-orbital degrees of freedom also get polarized due to the interactions.The lowest-order hy- bridization corrections will not only give rise to spin-spin superexchange but the same mechanism will also couple the orbitals,which can give rise to distinct orbital- ordering patterns. ' Of course, spin and orbital ordering are physically distinct in the sense that the continuous atomic-orbital symmetry is explicitly broken in the solid,giving rise to, e.g., crystal-and ligand-field splittings.For a MF treatment this is, in fact, an advantage,because the anisotropies in orbital space will lead to a reduction of the Auctuations.Furthermore,the electron-phonon ("Jahn-Teller" ) interactions have the tendency to stabi- lize the same orbital ordering as the electronic interac- tions,' and often the right ordering pattern follows directly from the crystal structure.We have now arrived at a stage where we can write down our energy functional.We postulate the following expression for the total energy functional:

')+ V'D,
(9) where V" are the usual LDA potentials,corresponding to the charge density with the number of d electrons given by nz = g n; In Eqs. (8) and (9) only the differences between the po- larized spin and/or orbital occupancies and the unpolar- ized LDA occupancies show up.
This is the essence of our construction;we conjecture that the charge-charge term in Eq. (3) is properly included in standard
LDA.
We note that this is consistent with the constrained LDA, as the mean-field technique introduced by Hybert- sen et al. shows. ' If this is the case, then Eqs. (8) and (9) follow for the orbital and spin dependence on the mean- field level.Therefore,our correction is only nonzero if spin and/or orbital order develops.Otherwise,it reduces to standard
LDA.
In Eqs. (8) and (9) we use the average d occupancy (n ) as a reference point.
Although the occupancies in the different m channels will in general be different from one another due to single-particle (crystal-field,ligand-field) effects, the LDA Hartree and xc potentials are orbital in- dependent in the LMTO-ASA calculations,because the charge density is averaged.
The normal LDA calculation has thus to be identified with a model MF solution which is independent of the orbital occupancies and then Eqs.
(8) and (9) follow for the energy and potentials of the unrestricted solutions.In Eq. (8) only the first Hund's rule is obeyed.This is not a fundamental restriction.It is not dificult to generalize the expression to account for the orbital dependence of the Hund's-rule interaction.However,in this case we need explicit values for the AJ's which we cannot obtain from our spheridized LDA cal- culation,and we decided to ignore these small corrections for the time being.There are cases known where the interactions lead to a rehybridization of the orbitals [e.g., KzCuF4 (Refs. 41 and 42)]. Equations (8) and (9) are not sufficiently general to account for these cases; not only are the orbital occu- pancies needed,but the phase relations between the on- site orbitals are also required.It is again obvious what has to be done: From a variational point of view, one can improve Eqs. (8) and (9) by also allowing the "orbital ffip" amplitudes
(d d ) with mAm' to develop.These will carry the needed phase information.These
E"
is the usual (spin-independent) LDA total energy.
Equation (8) is only defined with respect to an orthonor- mal single-particle basis with localized orbitals,representing the strongly correlated electrons,and n is the average occupancy of one d orbital (n =nz/10).
The quantities n;are the spin- and orbital-dependent occupancies of these local orbitals.
Finally,the parame- ters U and J are identified with the LDA U and Stoner parameter I, respectively.
In analogy with the formula- tion of usual
LDA,
the total energy Eq. (8) can be represented by single-particle equations,and the single- particle potentials are then given by

In Table I we summarize our results for parameters
U
and J for the 3d-transition-metal monoxides,as found from Eqs. (10) and (ll). For nonzero J, the d bands split up further and it is then convenient to define a U',which is derived from Eq. (1) using the lowest-energy (high-spin) d" ' and d" configurations.
These values are also indicated in the table, as well as empirical estimates for these quantities
(U,
, U,
), which we will discuss later in more detail.
Using the calculated values for U and J, we determined the self-consistent solutions of Eqs.
(8) and (9). In all cases we found the experimental spin structure (e.g., AF-II for the rocksalt oxides) to be the most stable one. The orbital ordering is a more delicate affair; in the cuprates as well as in MnO and NiO the de- generacy of the ground state is already lifted at the single-particle level.
In CoO, the small tetragonal distor- tion pushes the tz 3d orbital to higher energy.
On the other hand,the t2 3d, , orbitals are still degenerate and this opens up the possibility of an electronically driven orbital ordering.
However,the "orbital superex- change" energy scale is tiny, and the energy differences between ferro- and staggered orbital configurations turned out to be inside the noise of our calculation.
We arrived at the same conclusion in the case of FeO.
The actual level splitting (before the hybridization with the d orbitals is switched on) in the self-consistent solu- tions of Eqs. (8) and (9) will be in general smaller than the "bare" U or J, because of the deviation from integral valency.
If the actual d occupancy is d" (instead of d", e.g., x =0.2 in NiO), the splitting between the occu- pied spin-up and the unoccupied spin-down e levels is
( U+ J)(1
x ), and the splitting between the occupied t2g and unoccupied e level with the same spin is
( U
J)(1
x ) in the case of NiO.

Further, the (diagonal) splittings between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied d state, as well as the splitting between the 0 2p level and the lowest unoccupied d state in the converged mean-field solution,are shown ( UscF and hscF, respectively).For comparison,we also show the empirical p-d splitting (Ref. 42) (6, p).

(mean-field) account of the Hund's-rule coupling,the oc- cupied (or unoccupied) levels are also split. For instance,the splitting between the up- and down-spin tz states in NiO equals J(2 2x ). In Table I we indicate the energy difference between the highest-lying occupied and the lowest-lying unoccupied d orbitals (Usc) in the self- consistent-field solution.Finally, we also include in Table I the splitting between the oxygen p level and the lowest unoccupied d level (4sc), to be compared with the empirical charge-transfer energy (b,, ).In Figs. 1 3 we show the partial densities of states (DOS) of CaCuOz, NiO, and CoO. The DOS of FeO and MnO are similar to that of CoO, except for the growing number of unoccupied t2 bands.First, focusing on the unoccupied density of states of NiO (Fig. 2), we see that all the weight is concentrated in the narrow E 1 peak, in agreement with the experimentally observed d +d peak.In CoO (Fig. 3) the 3d J, orbital is emptied too,and this band is located at -0.5 eV lower energy.This crystal-field splitting of the unoccupied d band is also found experimentally.The calculated splitting seems to be somewhat too small,which is probably due to our neglect of nonspherical corrections.Comparing now the unoccupied DOS of CoO or NiO with that of CaCu02,we find that the width of the 3d 2 2$ band of the cu- x y prate is larger by a factor of 4 5 compared to that of the rocksalt oxides.As a result,a sharp d d' peak is missing,which is in striking agreement with experiment.This is obviously related to the formation of a broad Cu 3d 2 2 0 2p band caused by the relatively small in-plane Cu O bond length and a Cu
O
Cu bond angle of 180'. In CuO, on the other hand, the bond angles are much smaller (between 96' and 146') so that two neighboring Cu 3d 2 2 orbitals hardly couple via x y the same (2por 2p )0 orbital.One expects thus a strong decrease of the bandwidth in going from CaCuQ2 to CuO,despite the similarity of both systems on a local level.In Fig. 4 we show our result for the DOS of CuO.The CuO structure has four equivalent Cu atoms per cell.Experimentally,the unoccupied DOS of CuO is charac- terized by a relatively sharp peak corresponding with the unoccupied d band,which is strongly contrasting with the "blurred" unoccupied DOS of the high-T, cuprates.
Qur results suggest that this difference comes from the smaller bandwidth in the former. [Our calculation for CuO incorrectly splits the narrow band into four sub- bands due to slight inaccuracies in the directions of the local x and y axes.The proper bandwidth must lie be- tween the calculated widths of the subbands (-0.1 eV) and the entire band ( 1 eV).] It is dangerous to compare our calculated DOS direct- ly with photoemission (PES) line shapes.
In general,one expects that satellites will have too much weight, features in the MF DOS will be too narrow,main-line satellite splittings will be underestimated,etc.
Nevertheless,the differences between the calculated occupied DQS of Ca- Cu02, on the one hand,and CoO and NiO, on the other hand,are striking.
In the former, a rather broad "main band" (between
2 and 6 eV in Fig. 1) is found,while in the latter the low binding energy (BE) part of the 20 10

Compared to CaCu02, the unoccupied d, as well as the occu- pied local singlet, bandwidth is decreased.
DOS is indicative of a two- (narrow-) peak structure (
4 and 5 eV in Fig. 2), as in experiment. " The character of the low-lying ionization states of the cuprate is in rather good agreement with the expectations from many-body theory.
These states are of 3d 2 2 and 2p character,and the added hole has its spin antiparallel to the ground-state Cu spin (this is evident from the 3d 2
21' DOS).
This is the mean-field analog of the x y Zhang-Rice singlet.
We note that the "local singlet" binding energy is underestimated in MF.
In the limit

6))t d,one finds for this binding energy
tz&/(U b, ) and the Kondo Auctuations add another
tz&[1/b, + I/(U 5)].
It is interesting to note that the "local singlet" bandwidth is, according to our calcu- lation,rather large ( 3 eV; see the 3d,,l DOS), in agreement with recent many-body calculations.
It is again instructive to compare CaCu02 with CuO. It can be seen that the local singlet bands and the unoccupied d bands are quite similar in shape, as if they are mirrored around EF (suggestive with respect to the single-band ideas of, e.g., Zhang and Rice,). According to the cal- culation,the broad local singlet band is partially hidden under the main band in CaCuOz.
On the other hand,in CuO this band is well separated and has a small disper- sional width,although in the calculations the total width is only reduced by a factor ', compared with CaCu02,due to the large splittings between the subbands.Gun- narsson et al.,pointed out very recently that the photo- emission spectrum of CuO is characterized by a peaklike

949 structure at the valence-band top, which is missing in the spectra of high-T, compounds.
In the case of NiO and CoO our results are less con- ventional.
In the past, the lowest BE peak in the occu- pie ied DOS has been ascribed to the high-spin d" ' state (e.g.T =e 1' e 1 t 7 in NiO) and the higher BE shoul- 51 der to the low-spin state (in NiO E=eg 1 es 1 es $),and this is also the outcome of several many-body-model cal- culations. ' According to our calculations,this high- spin low-spin identification has to be reversed.The lowest peak in NiO is clearly of E character and of the same sort as the local singlet band in the cuprates.Due to our account of the Hund's-rule coupling,the
T
1 DOS is shifted to lower BE compared to T2 1, and 2g the erst maximum in the former coincides with the shoul- der in the PES spectra.
This low-spin nature of the lowest ionization state of NiO is in agreement with exper- iment.
This follows unambiguously from doping experi- ments.
NiO can be doped with large concentrations of Li, and the Ni(III) compound LiNi02 is especially well characterized.
In this compound,every second (111) plane of Ni is replaced by Li and the local environment of the Ni ions barely changes.
LiNi02 is thus from a local perspective representative for NiO.
According to x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data, the additional holes 54 (introduced by Li doping) have 0 2p character.
Fur- ther, LiNi02 is a low-spin (S= ,' ) material.The many- 55 body interpretation is as follows:the added hole goes predominantly in the oxygen band and it gets bound to the Ni spin, forming a local doublet,

In LiNi02, a lo- cal doublet can be ascribed to each Ni site and the system is half-filled and therefore magnetically ordered.
Let us now consider what the electronic structure of LiNi02 looks like according to our mean-field theory.
To simplify matters,we performed calculations for the rock- salt structure with every second (111)Ni plane substitut- ed by Li, neglecting the small (-0.6%%uo) contraction per- pendicular to the (111) layers,which does not aff'ect the states at Ez. In Fig. 5 we show the DOS for the most stable (ferromagnetic,ferro-orbital-ordered) ground-state configuration.Compared to NiO, there are some similar- ities. %'e find still a rather narrow d d unoccupied 8 9 3d band at roughly the same position as in NiO, relative to the first occupied state.The new aspect is that a new unoccupied band of predominantly 0 2p character is found inside the "NiO gap, " which is centered just above 54
EI. This is the same pattern
as found by Kuiper et al. in their XAS data.
How to interpret these findings?
The important (180 ) binding occurs along the cubic axis of the rocksalt struc- ture.
In Fig. 6 we show a simplified level diagram along one of these directions.
As in NiO, the Ni ion is rather strongly polarized,and the 3d up- and down-spin levels are separated by
U. Because of the p-d hybridization
the up- and down-spin 0 2p levels next to an up-spin Ni will be pushed upwards and downwards,respectively.
Adding one hole per Ni implies that the former gets

densities of states of NiLiOz,for a ferromagnetic arrangement of the local doublets perpen- dicular to the (111)planes. unoccupied and we observe that the oxygen hole has its spin reversed relative to the 3d spin, and this one can call the MF version of the local doublet.
In our calculation we find a moment of 1.30pz and
0. 15pz at the Ni and
the 0 site, respectively,and the net moment per NiO2 unit is therefore exactly lp (S=,'). Strictly speaking,tpd / Li

one should call this MF result a ferrimagnet,while in reality LiNiOz is better characterized by calling it a low- spin d system.
However,this difference is more of a quantitative than of a qualitative nature.
The ferrimag- net will be characterized by an optical branch in the mag- non spectrum,related to the out-of-phase rotation of the Ni and O spins.
On the other hand, the low-spin system will have a doublet to quartet d-d excitation,and the latter will be bigger than the magnon mass gap.
Amus- ingly,the quantum fluctuations responsible for the in- crease of optical magnon gap are the O-hole Ni-spin Kondo spin-Alp processes.
Turning to the overall magnetic structure,the issue is if the NiOz unit 5= ,' spins will order ferromagnetically (FM) or antiferromagnetically (AFM) and it is before- hand not obvious what will happen.In Fig. 6 we consid- er the AFM case. The "left" O 2p down-spin level will be occupied and to the right it will be unoccupied.
These levels will hybridize via the Li site, pushing down the oc- cupied state further,leading to an energy gain.
In the FM this effect is not present and this (basically superex- change) mechanism will thus tend to favor antiparallel alignment.
However,according to our calculations,the moments in the FM state are larger, and the resulting en- ergy gain wins from the superexchange and we predict that LiNiOz is ferromagnetic.
This is not a subtle bal- ance.
We find that the FM state is more stable than the AFM state by an amount -0.15 eV/LiNi02,indicating that the NiO units are not at all isolated from each other by the Li layers.
The experimental situation is unclear.
Some support for our prediction follows from the finding that at intermediate Li concentrations the Ni spins in next-nearest-neighbor layers have indeed a FM orienta- tion.
According to (inverse) photoemission, LiNi02 is an in- sulator with a gap -0.4 eV.
According to our calcula- tion, it is still a metal (Fig. 5), although a metal-insulator transition is in the close neighborhood.
The splitting be- tween the up- and down local doublet bands is larger than their width and the problem is that there are two of these bands per spin direction.
These have the symmetry of Ni-centered 3d 2 2 and 3d 2, states,which are x y 3z 1 equivalent in the LiNiOz structure.
We allowed for orbit- al polarization in the calculation and we found a ferromagnetic-type orbital polarization on the Ni site n(3d g
7. )
n(3d
)=O. 15. As can be seen from the x y 3z 1 figure,this tends to split the doublet band in an empty 3d 2 2 and a filled 3d 2, part.
However, Ni-centered
X
3z 1 orbital polarization is less effective in this respect than the spin polarization,and we find that the two bands still overlap.
However,our result is very close to the metal- insulator transition and it is not hard to imagine that,e.g., a U on the oxygens (neglected by us) could drive the system insulating.
Also, Jahn-Teller-type lattice distor- tions could be responsible.
These distortions should be of the O& D4I, sort, and in Fig. 7 we show the result ob- tained if we elongate the NiO6 octahedra by 4% in the z direction and contract the bonds with 2% in the x and y directions,stacking the distorted octahedra uniformly.
It is seen that this relatively small distortion su%ces to give

If Ni(III) low- spin counting makes sense, as we believe to be the case on rather general grounds,what is the reason that this sys- tem does not show a collective Jahn-Teller instability?NiS has attracted much attention in the past because of its unconventional metal-insulator transition.Below the transition, NiS is a large-moment,small-gap antiferro- magnetic insulator with an extrapolated Neel tempera- ture of 1000 K. At 260 K the volume contracts with
2%%uo, and the material becomes a (semi)metal with a rel- atively low Pauli susceptibility.
In Fig. 8 we show our results for the DOS of NiS.Clearly, "U) 8"' is well satisfied,and according to our calculation, NiS is a typi- cal local-moment material.We also find that antiferro- magnetic NiS is metallic and that the states at EF are of nearly pure S 3p character.NiS is therefore a p-type ma- terial, as in the many-body picture.Regarding the M-I transition,the simplest assertion one can make is to as- cribe this to a Stoner transition,where the volume effect leads to a change of bandwidth,quenching the exchange splitting.We checked this possibility and,obviously,we found that the relatively small volume effects cannot fight the larg

This is a p-type local-moment metal. toemission data of Fujimori's group.We thus arrive at the interesting conclusion that the insulating state and the M-I transition of NiS are beyond mean-field theory.So far, our method has been quite informative in quali- tative respects.Let us now consider how well it works quantitatively.In Table II we summarize our findings for the band gaps and moments of the late-3d-transition- metal oxides.Especially at the end of the series, our mo- ments are considerably larger than the LSDA moments,and these results are now within the experimental error bars.Notice that the values in brackets indicate the total moment,including the orbital contribution.The calculated band gaps are more problematic.Ex- perimentally,one finds the following pattern:the gaps in NiO and MnQ are large and of equal magnitude,the gaps of FeO and CoO compounds are substantially smaller,and the cuprates have the smallest gaps.Except for the small cuprate gap, this trend is not reproduced by our method.We find instead that the gap is of the same or- der of magnitude in going from NiO to MnO, with a ten- dency to increase towards the middle of the series.Com- parison of MF results for the gap with exact (diagonaliza- tion,and quantum Monte Carlo ) results in the case of the three-band Hubbard model indicates that MF theory always overestimates the gap magnitude,and from this point of view NiO and MnO seem to be more of the prob- lem than the other compounds.In our results,the gap magnitude is limited by the charge-transfer energy,and this quantity is apparently underestimated in the calcula- tions.We note that the standard LDA p-d splitting is larger than ours; fixing (n ) in Eqs. (8) and (9) from the beginning (instead of adjusting it self-consistently) yields a NiQ gap -4 eV.The underestimation of 6 cannot explain the small gaps of CoO and FeO, compared to the ones of NiO or MnO.Recently, Zaanen and Sawatzky conjectured that FeO and CoO are better characterized as classical ( U( b, ) Mott-Hubbard insulators,in contrast to the charge-transfer nature of, e.g., NiO or CuO.The reason is that the U's are relatively small in these two compounds.Zaanen and Sawatzky estimated the U's from empirical atomic ionization potentials together with a constant screening contribution,determined by sub- tracting the empirical (PES) U from the atomic U of NiO.The smallest U is the one containing the exchange stabili- zation (U',Vi" in Table I) and this quantity is seen to be much smaller in CoO and (especially) FeO than in MnO or NiO, and it seems likely that U,&&A in the former two.
A relatively small gap is thus expected for FeO and CoO, and this "small U" interpretation is supported by the observation that the optical gap is rather blurred in these compounds,compared to the sharp (p-d excitonic) edges characteristic for nickelates and cuprates.
Look- ing at the LDA values for U and 6, this crossover clearly cannot occur.The 6's tend to be smaller and the U's larger than the empirical estimates (note that U, s- is U
J
for Fe, Co, and Ni and U+4J for Mn, neglecting orbital contributions) and FeO and CoO are, according to our method,also charge-transfer insulators.
Further,a drop in U is also present in our results;however,it occurs be- tween Co and Fe, instead of Ni and Co.
Although the Mott-Hubbard character of FeO and CoQ remains to be proven,it seems quite probable that the LDA U's and 6's are somewhat too large and too small, respectively.The same conclusion seems to follow from the comparison of impurity model results with ex- perimental spectra.We emphasize that this is not caused by our way of using these parameters: The mean- field treatment is merely a convenient test for the accura- cy of the "constrained-LDA" parameters.
Although the problem is not acute for the localized materials considered up to now, it becomes quite serious in more delocalized systems.
In Table I we have also in- cluded the LDA U's for the early-3d-transition-metal monoxides.It can be seen that U stays about as large as in the late-3d-transition-metal monoxides,in disagree- ment with the generally accepted point of view.Accord- ingly,we find that also TiO and VQ are relatively large gap insulators if we use these U's in our functional.Al- ternatively,using Herring s metallic screening (i.e., 5nd is exactly compensated by s,p charge),we find generally U &3 eV. For such values of U, the MF treatment would predict VO and TiQ to be nonmagnetic metals.This points to a rather serious problem with respect to the calculation of U: Even in strongly itinerant systems like the early-3d-transition-metal oxides,the metallic screening is not complete according to the LDA.This has a good reason; according to LDA, the d-sp Coulomb interaction is only a few eV, and this small interaction cannot compete with the large sp-band width.This prob- lem deserves investigation.

III. CONCLUDING
REMARKS
In this paper we have combined some common-sense notions (constrained
LDA,
the success of MF model theory,etc.) into a LDA-like parameter-free theory,which turns out to yield a sensible description of the elec- tronic structure of Mott insulators.
Admittedly,our con- struction is purely heuristic and it is, in this respect,different from the self-interaction correction (SIC) to LDA as recently applied by Svane and Gunnarsson to Mott insulators.
The SIC equations are derived within the framework of homogeneous-electron-gas theory,and this method is therefore a logical extension of LDA.
This is obviously not the case for our construction.
In the end, in SIC the localization is also driven by the on- site Coulomb interactions (now interpreted as a self- interaction effect), and the results of Svane and Gun- narsson for the 3d-transition-metal oxides seem similar to ours.
However,on closer inspection there are impor- tant differences.
In our method,the orbital dependence of the potentials may quench the orbital moments fur- ther.
In SIC, however,the nonspherical part of the xc energy tends to favor spherical orbitals,leading to an overestimation of the magnitude of the orbital mo- ments.
On the other hand,the nonmagnetic character of the early-3d-transition-metal monoxides is reproduced in SIC, while our scheme has problems.
As emphasized before,our method should have the same deficiencies as the mean-field method in the context of the model Hamiltonian approach.
However,as our ex- amples make clear, it can be quite useful to have these mean-field solutions at hand,especially in complicated situations where band detail does matter.
We foresee therefore that our method will have its major use in guid- ing the many-body approach in such situations.
In some examples discussed in the present paper, it is not hard to imagine how the Auctuations will change the situation.
In other cases this may not be so straightforward.
For instance,in metallic Ni it is well established that the magnetism is well represented by the LSDA, which is an effective Stoner theory,with I=
0.9 eV.
In our MF approach,we would find a Stoner splitting
U+ J,
being too large by a factor of 5 ( UD-4 eV). This large discrepancy is due to a rather severe breakdown of the MF approach in these metallic situations.
However,in model theory it is well known that one has to go beyond a MF description in order to get a sensible description of itinerant magnets and also in this respect our method can be of use in the future.
As shown by Stollhoff et al.,these systems seem to be well described by the local- ansatz method of Stollhoff and Fulde.
However,up to now, these studies were for the 3d metals limited to mod- el Hamiltonians,and our method makes it possible to perform ab initio local-ansatz calculations.
