CO Combustion on Supported Gold Clusters Matthias Arenz,[a] Uzi Landman,[b] and Ueli Heiz*[a] Introduction There are several reasons why gold has for a long time been regarded as a poor catalyst in heterogeneous catalysis. Most importantly, gold is the most noble of all metals in the bulk form. This property is due to the qualities of low adsorption energy of gases and high dissociation barriers, which are im- portant for most catalytic reactions.[1] Furthermore, the low melting point of gold hampers the preparation of nanoparti- cles smaller than 10 nm in diameter,[2] which is crucial for maxi- mizing the active surface area of a catalyst. First results which indicated that small gold particles might nevertheless be inter- esting for catalyzing reactions were reported in the early 1970s.[3,4] However, it was the work of Haruta et al.[2,5,6] which clearly established the exciting catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles. In 1983 they developed a method for preparing hemispherical gold particles on selected metal oxides, and showed that gold nanoparticles exhibit high catalytic activity for reactions such as CO oxidation and propylene epoxidation,especially at low temperatures.[5] CO oxidation was reported at temperatures as low as 200 K, which makes gold interesting for a series of applications at room temperature. Since then a huge number of papers have been published aimed at trying to understand the special catalytic properties of gold nanopar- ticles, that is, particles 15 nm in diameter. Possible applica- tions are manifold; for example, the hydrochlorination of ace- tylene using carbon-supported gold catalysts has been investi- gated by Hutchings et al.[7,8] For further examples,see refs. [2,6,911] and references therein.
In the following a short overview of the combustion of CO on gold nanoparticles will be given. In early papers a classical LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism was assumed for the reac- tion involving the dissociation of oxygen molecules on Au,[12] as is the case for platinum-group metals. The catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles was thus explained by an increased heat of adsorption of oxygen atoms, produced by a hot filament on gold nanoparticles, compared to that of bulk gold.[12,13] Newer results, however, indicated that the way in which gold acts cat- alytically is substantially different from that of other noble metals.[11] For example, it is now well-established that inde- pendent of the substrate, molecular O2, most likely O2 , reacts with CO to form CO2 and no oxygen dissociation occurs upon adsorption on gold nanoparticles.[1416] Henry et al. showed that, on reactive Au particles after adsorbing oxygen and pumping of the oxygen in the chamber, no adsorbed oxygen can be titrated by CO pulses any more, thus excluding the dis- sociative adsorption of oxygen.[17] In fact, it seems that the rel- atively weak adsorption energy of oxygen on gold and the for- mation of activated oxygen molecules are the key for low- temperature catalysis.
Despite the number of publications concerning CO oxida- tion on gold nanoparticles, the reaction mechanism and the factors controlling the reactivity are still not well understood.
This is partially due to the variety of supports and preparation procedures used, which leads to contradictory reports on the catalytic activity and the importance of the experimental varia- bles. In their review, Bond and Thompson[11] summarized as consensual observations the facts that i) oxide-supported small gold particles show the highest reactivity at sizes of about 2 to 3 nm, whereas unsupported gold particles are weakly active at best; and ii) the choice of support, the method of preparation,and the pretreatment before use are very important factors that control the reactivity. They discussed a possible mecha- nism involving reaction at the edge of a particle that included the support, thus emphasizing the importance of the perime- ter interface. Similarly, Haruta recently reported[2] that the per- Recent progress in the understanding of the fascinating catalysis of CO combustion by supported gold particles is summarized. Fo- cusing on size-selected gold clusters consisting of only a few atoms, that is, the size regime with properties nonscalable from the bulk properties, we discuss the current knowledge of the dif- ferent factors controlling the reactivity at the molecular level.
These factors include the role of the oxide support, its defects,cluster charging as well as the structural fluxionality of clusters,the cluster size dependency, and the promotional effect of water.
By combining experimental results with quantum mechanical ab initio calculations, a detailed picture of the reaction mechanism emerges. While similar mechanisms might be active for gold nanoparticles in the scalable size regime, it is shown that for dif- ferent systems (defined by the cluster size, the support, experi- mental conditions, etc.) the reaction mechanism differs and,hence, no generalized explanation for the catalytic driving force of small gold particles can be given.

KGaA, Weinheim 1871 formance of Au nanoparticles is defined by three major factors:the contact structure to the oxide support, the nature of the support, and the particle size, with the contact structure being the most important. The proposed perimeter model implies the direct involvement of the support in the CO oxidation re- action.[18] Furthermore, an enhancement of the catalytic activity of small gold particles due to moisture was reported.[19,20] This is particularly interesting for applications under ambient condi- tions, since the presence of moisture is commonly found to be detrimental to the activity of the particles. In contrast to the perimeter model of Haruta, Goodman and Choudhary[21] con- cluded, on the basis of a bilayered Au model catalyst which blocks the access of the support by the reactants, that the TiOx support acts mainly as a dispersant and a promoter. Theoreti- cal studies also highlight the importance of the periphery of the interface between a gold particle and the oxide support.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that the propensity of O2 to adsorb on finite-size Au particles is increased, particularly at low-coordinated sites.[16,2226] The importance of low-coordinat- ed sites is in line with the experimental work on supported gold model catalysts by Freund et al.[2729] They emphasize the influence of highly uncoordinated gold atoms on the CO ad- sorption properties. To summarize, the variety of different preparation procedures, pretreatment conditions, and sup- ports, the often undefined catalysts, and the strong interde- pendence of these factors with the observed catalytic activity prevent a uniform description of the processes involved.
To disentangle the factors controlling the reactivity of gold,it is thus helpful to study the underlying concepts on well-de- fined model systems. In this Minireview, we summarize the work covering CO combustion on size-selected gold particles supported on thin oxide films. The size of the particles is below 1 nm in diameter, that is, the size regime in which the electronic, and thus catalytic, properties of the particles are not scalable from the bulk properties. In contrast to the work on gold nanoparticles, the systems discussed are exclusively model catalysts on planar supports. The focus is on work from our laboratory in combination with extensive ab initio calcula- tions.
The Size-Dependent Reactivity of Supported Aun Clusters Aun clusters were produced by a laser vaporization source,[30,31] size-selected in a quadrupole mass spectrometer, and deposit- ed with low kinetic energy (<0.2 eV/atom, that is, soft landing) on thin oxide films.[32,33] One concern when using free clusters to prepare monodispersed cluster materials is the fate of the deposited cluster during and after deposition. In addition to molecular dynamics simulations,[34] several experiments, such as STM investigations[35,36] or absorption spectroscopy of clus- ters embedded in a rare-gas matrix, have been performed,which demonstrate that soft landing of clusters is possible.[37] Also, the studies of the chemical reactivity of supported clus- ters using pulsed molecular beams show evidence of stability of the samples.[38] Recently, we were able to prove the mono- dispersion of the cluster with cavity ringdown spectroscopy.[39] Supported, small gold clusters have mainly been deposited on thin MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) films. These thin films can be prepared either as defect-rich films, characterized by a given density [5% monoACHTUNGTRENUNGlayer (ML) of extended defects and point defects [F cen- ters (FC)], or as defect-poor films with a negligible density of F centers.[14,40] In our laboratory the CO oxidation reaction was studied by a combination of temperature-programmed reac- tion (TPR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.Isotopically labeled 18O2 and 13CO molecules were used in these experiments, and the catalytic oxidation of CO involving oxygen atoms from the MgO substrate is excluded, since only the 13C16O18O isotopomer was detected. Bare MgO films,defect-poor as well as defect-rich, are inert to CO oxidation.[14] As demonstrated in Figure 1, gold clusters up to the hep- tamer are inert to CO oxidation on defect-rich MgO and the smallest size for which the low-temperature (T<250 K) com- bustion was detected is Au8. For larger sizes a distinct size de- pendency is observed (Figure 1a), with roughly two tempera- ture regions for CO oxidation, T<250 and >250 K, which are associated with different reaction mechanisms (see below). As expected, gold films are inert to CO oxidation. By integrating the total area in the mass spectra, the total number of CO2 molecules formed per cluster can be plotted versus the number of atoms per cluster (Figure 1b). No linear dependen- cy of the reactivity as a function of size is observed, which clearly indicates that the number of reactive sites differs for each cluster size. Recently, Anderson et al.[41,42] started to inves- tigate the CO oxidation reaction on size-selected gold clusters;they used a TiO2ACHTUNGTRENUNG(110) single crystal as substrate. By employing Figure 1. a) Temperature programmed reaction experiments for the CO-oxi- dation on selected Aun clusters on defect-rich MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) films.

pulsed molecular CO beams at room temperature, small activi- ties for cluster sizes even smaller than Au8, that is, Aun with n=37, were reported. For Au7, a steep increase in reactivity is observed. Notably, the cluster density for Au7 is ten times lower than on all other surfaces and, hence, the steep increase in CO2 molecules formed per Au atom (by a factor of about 10) might be due to calibration problems. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate a strong dependence of the substrate on the reactivity of Au clusters.
The Reaction Mechanism Turning our attention to the reaction mechanism for CO oxida- tion on gold clusters supported on MgO films, two characteris- tics are important. As exemplified in the TPR spectra of Au8 supported on defect-poor and defect-rich MgO films (Figure 2),the reactivity is strongly dependent on the number of defects on the support (see below); second, for reactive gold clusters (see also Figure 1), two temperature regions are observed at roughly T<250 and >250 K. In the two temperature regions,two different reaction pathways may contribute to the oxida- tion of CO. Notice that due to the reaction conditions,[14] peaks in the TPR spectra can be associated with LangmuirHinshel- wood (LH) types of reaction mechanisms. Extensive ab initio calculations of the reaction mechanism on Au8/MgO indicate two different LH-type mechanisms. Correlated to the formation of CO2 at 140 K (Figure 3ac), the two reactants are initially co- adsorbed on the triangular top facet of the Au8, therefore termed the LHt mechanism. The distance between the carbon atom and one of the peroxo oxygen atoms in this local mini- mum state is equal to 3.11 K [dACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO1)]. Through mapping of the potential energy surface along the CO1 reaction coordinate, a rather low energy barrier DEb (LHt)=0.1 eV occurring at dACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO1)
2.0 K is determined for the LHt oxidation channel, with the
end product a weakly adsorbed carbon dioxide molecule ACHTUNGTRENUNG(0.2 eV). This LHt low-temperature oxidation mechanism occurs, in these theoretical studies (with similar energetics), for reactions on the gold cluster deposited on either a defect-free MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) surface, or on one containing an F5c defect site.[14] Both are expected to be relatively insensitive to the Aun cluster size, thus correlating with the experimental results (Figures 1 and 2).
As shown in Figure 2, the higher-temperature channel is strongly enhanced for Au8 supported on a defect-rich (com- pared to a defect-poor) MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) support. This trend corre- lates with the simulations of an LH periphery (LHp) reaction mechanism, which starts with a CO molecule adsorbed on the top facet of the Au8 cluster and a peroxo O2* molecule bonded to the periphery of the interfacial layer of the cluster (where the distance between the C atom and the oxygen atom marked O1 is dACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO1)=4.49 K). Indeed, mapping of the potential energy surface along the CO1 reaction coordinate reveals for Figure 2. Temperature programmed reaction experiments for the CO-oxida- tion on Au8 clusters on a) defect-poor and b) defect-rich MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) films;inset c) shows the results after producing FC on MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) after the proce- dure of PfnLr et al. The model catalysts are saturated at 90 K with 13CO and 18O2 and the isotopomer 13C18O16O is detected with a mass spectrometer, as function of temperature.

ChemPhysChem 2006, 7, 1871  1879 ? 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.chemphyschem.org 1873 CO Combustion on Supported Gold Clusters Au8/MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c) a rather broad reaction barrier DEbACHTUNGTRENUNG(LHp)0.5 eV at dACHTUNGTRENUNG(CO1)2.0 K (Figure 3), while for the defect-free substrate a significantly higher barrier of DEbACHTUNGTRENUNG(LHp)0.8 eV is found; the reaction product is shown in Figure 3 f for the Au8/MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c) catalyst. This change in activation energy is at the origin of the observed change in reactivity, as for the defect-poor substrate the CO molecule desorbs prior to reaction. The question may arise as to why the two reaction channels are observed experi- mentally, as the low-temperature mechanism should always be dominant because its reaction rate is orders of magnitude higher. In fact, theoretical studies reveal that only one oxygen molecule adsorbs on the clusters. Thus, there exists an ensem- ble of Au8 with an oxygen molecule adsorbed on the periph- ery, and another ensemble with the oxygen molecule bound to the top facet of the cluster. In fact, the ratio of the number of CO2 molecules formed at low and high temperature is in the same range as the ratio of O2 molecules that directly adsorb on Au8 (leading to O2 adsorbed on the top facet of Au8), and which adsorb via re- verse spillover from the MgO substrate (leading to O2 adsor- bed on the periphery of Au8).
In addition to the two LH-type mechanisms,a third reaction path was found in the calcula- tions, which starts from the opti- mal configuration of O2* adsor- bed on the Au8/MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c) cata- lyst. A gas-phase CO molecule brought into the vicinity of the peroxo molecule reacts sponta- neously (without an energy bar- rier), to form a CO2 molecule weakly bound to the catalyst.Therefore, this reaction (Figur- e 3 g,h) corresponds to an Eley Rideal (ER)-type mechanism,which can occur even at 90 K,that is, during the initial dosing stage in the experiment.
The Role of the MgO Substrate In the following discussion, we take a closer look at the influ- ence of surface defects on the activity of the smallest active gold cluster on MgO, that is, Au8. As discussed above, the strong influence of defect structures of the MgO substrate on the reactivity of Au8 is apparent in the experiments (Figure 2).
An important class of point defects in MgO is oxygen vacan- cies; their direct characterization on the surface, however, is not straightforward. Only recently, singly charged surface oxygen vacancies (F+ centers) have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements by Freund et al.[43] Neutral F centers are not susceptible to EPR spectroscopy, but have been investigated by scanning tunnel- ing microscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS, respective- ly).[44,45] On MgO films prepared with low deposition rates, Au8 is almost inert; however, Au8 becomes active on defective MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) films prepared with high deposition rates.[14] On the latter films Au8 forms CO2 at 140 and 280 K. Note that these observations are independent of the preparation procedure for defect-rich MgO films; that is, films prepared by high deposi- tion rates show the same results as films with a high density of F centers prepared after the methodology of PfnLr et al.[46] (see Figure 2c). This finding suggests that F centers play a crucial role in the reactivity of Au8.
The influence of F centers on MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) films on the reactivi- ty of gold clusters is studied in more detail by FTIR spectrosco- py, using CO as both reactant and probe molecule. These ex- periments are combined with extensive DFT calculations. In the FTIR spectra shown in Figure 4, CO stretching frequencies at 2102 and 2077/2049 cm1 (Au8 on defect-poor and defect-rich films,respectively) are observed as well as a band at 1300 cm1, which is tentatively attributed to highly activated O2, thus indicating that both reactants (CO and O2) are adsor- bed molecularly at 90 K.[15] For the reactive model catalyst these vibrational bands disappear in concert with the forma- tion of CO2 (Figure 4a) whereas, in the case of the unreactive model catalyst [Au8/MgO(defect-poor)], the two reactants simply desorb from the sample, as monitored by mass spec- trometry.[14,15] From theoretical studies, three energy-optimized deposited cluster configurations pertinent to the experimental conditions are obtained (Figure 5). The bare adsorbed Au8 clus- ter (Figure 5a) exhibits only a slight distortion from the struc- ture of the corresponding gas-phase neutral cluster.[15] Howev- er, the strong influence of F centers is reflected in the calculat- ed binding energy of Au8 to the defective MgO surface (3.445 eV) and to the defect-free surface (1.225 eV). For details Figure 4. FTIR spectra taken at 90 K after exposing the model catalysts a) Au8/MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100)defect-poor and b) Au8/MgO- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(100)defect-rich to 13CO and O2 and annealing the sample at the indicated temperature. The frequencies between 20502100 cm-1 are attributed to adsorbed CO, whereas the band at 1300 cm-1 may originate from activated O2 molecules. Note, the redshift of the CO-stretch by 50 cm-1 on defect-rich films. This shift is consistent with the pre- dicted charging of the cluster when deposited on an F center (c), where the difference of the charge densities of the isolated (Au8, MgO5Fc) and the model system (Au8/MgO5Fc) is calculated. The charging is estimated to be 0.5 e-. 1874 www.chemphyschem.org ? 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim ChemPhysChem 2006, 7, 1871  1879

calculations,see ref. [15].
Optimal geometries with a single adsorbed CO mole- cule, Au8/O2/CO/MgO(FC), and at saturation coverage of the clus- ter [that is, with three adsorbed
CO
molecules, Au8/O2/(CO)3/ MgO(FC)] are shown in Figure- s 5a and b, respectively. From the three adsorbed 13CO mole- cules at saturation coverage,only two have a significant dy- namic dipole moment perpen- dicular to the surface, CO(1) and CO(3), consistent with the experi- mental observation (Figure 4).
The key for understanding the influence of F centers on the re- activity of Au8 is the experimen- tally observed red shift in the CO stretching frequency, by 25 50 cm1 for CO/Au8/MgO(defect-rich) compared to CO/Au8/ MgO(defect-poor). This shift indicates a change in the charge state of the gold octamer bound to the defective magnesia surface, since the absorption frequency of CO adsorbed on metal surfaces depends strongly on the population of the anti- bonding 2p* orbital. Table 1 summarizes the calculated influ- ence of excess charge DQ for the isolated Au8/O2/13CO com- plex. The calculations clearly show that the 13CO stretching fre- quency shifts as a function of the charge state of the complex.
In detail, the shift is correlated with variations in the popula- tion of the antibonding state. For neutral complexes [DQ (Au8/ O2/13CO)=0 in Table 1] with zero spin, a vibrational frequency of 2009 cm1 is obtained for the adsorbed 13CO. The calculated decrease in frequency (61 cm1) in comparison to the value calculated for the free molecule is attributed to a net excess charge (0.285 e) on the adsorbed molecule, which results from back-donation into the COACHTUNGTRENUNG(2p*) antibonding state. As ex- pected, such donation of charge from occupied orbitals of the metal to unoccupied states of the adsorbed molecule is even more pronounced (0.878 e) for the more electronegative di- oxygen molecule. Upon charging the complex with up to
0.5 e, the net excess charge on the 13CO molecule is increased
to 0.341 e and is reflected in a red shift of the CO stretching frequency (1975 cm1) by 34 cm1 with respect to the neutral cluster case (2009 cm1). Concurrently, the CO bond length is increased (see Table 1). A similar behavior is also found when starting from the triplet state of the neutral complex. The actual degree of charge transfer can be deduced directly from ab initio calculations, where the charge density of the Au8/ MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c) system is compared with that of the isolated system [Au8, MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c)].[14,15] The difference in the two charge-density plots predicts a charge transfer of 0.5 e into the cluster (see middle part of Figure 4). Comparing theory and experiment,the experimentally observed red shift in the CO stretch for the molecule adsorbed on differently prepared MgO (defect- rich and defect-poor) films is thus direct experimental evidence of the existence of a high concentration of F centers on our defect-rich MgO films.
The consequences of the charge transfer from the oxygen vacancy into the deposited Au8 cluster for the binding and ac- tivation of the two reactants can be outlined by analyzing the local density of electronic states (LDOS) projected on the oxygen molecule, adsorbed at the periphery site of Au8/MgO- ACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c) (Figure 6a). All the prominent peaks can be unambiguous- ly assigned to orbitals of (free) molecular oxygen origin. In ad- dition, these states overlap with the entire d band of the Au8 cluster (Figure 6b) in the range of 7 eVEEF, where EF is the Fermi energy. Bonding of the oxygen molecule to the gold octamer involves mainly hybridization of the 5s, 1pk, and 1p ? oxygen states with the gold d band. Most importantly, the full Figure 5. Optimized configurations of a) a bare gold octamer (yellow spheres), adsorbed on an F-center of an MgO (001) surface (oxygen atoms in red and magnesium in green); b) a surface-supported gold octamer with an oxygen molecule, adsorbed at the interface between the cluster and the magnesia surface. Note, the significant change in the geometry of the clus- ter compared to the one shown in (a); c) the gold octamer on the magnesia surface (MgO(FC)) with three CO molecules (carbon in grey and oxygen in red), adsorbed on the top facet of the cluster and an oxygen molecule, pre- adsorbed at the interface between the cluster and the magnesia surface.
Note, that the molecule marked CO(2) lies parallel to the surface and is thus,not infra-red active in the experimental configuration employed here. The CO bond length d(CO(i)), the charge transferred to the CO(i) molecule DQ(i),and the calculated CO vibrational frequency n (i), i=1,2, and 3, as well as the corresponding values for the O2 molecule, are: d(CO(i)) [K]=1.151, 1.158,

The results are shown for various values of the spin; for the neutral cluster, triplet (S=1) and singlet (S=0) states. The displayed quantities are: n, the CO stretch frequency; BEACHTUNGTRENUNG(O2+13CO), the CO binding energy to the gold cluster with a pre- adsorbed oxygen molecule; the bond distances, dACHTUNGTRENUNG(13CO) and d(O2), and excess electronic charges, DQACHTUNGTRENUNG(13CO) and DQ(O2), of the two adsorbed reactants CO and O2. For reference, the calculated vibrational frequency of gas-phase 13CO is 2070 cm1, which is 25 cm1 smaller than the experimental value of nACHTUNGTRENUNG(13CO)=2095 cm1.
ChemPhysChem 2006, 7, 1871  1879 ? 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.chemphyschem.org 1875 CO Combustion on Supported Gold Clusters spin-manifold of the antibonding 2p* states of O2 is located below EF, which results in strong activation of the O2 molecule through occupation of the antibond- ing orbitals. This leads to weakening of the OO bond, which is reflected in a significant increase of its length (1.43 K) compared to that of the free molecule (1.25 K), and the molecule is adsorbed in a peroxo- like state.[15] We observe that O2 binding to the clus- ter is stronger in the presence of the F center (0.469 and 0.329 eV for the spin 0 and spin 1 states, respec- tively) in comparison to the case without F centers (0.329 and 0.299 eV for the spin 0 and spin 1 states,respectively). The bonding of CO to the Au8/O2/ MgO(FC) complex can be understood by analyzing the correlation diagram shown in Figure 7. It depicts the LDOS for the two reactants, CO (Figure 7a) and the Au8/O2/MgO(FC) complex (Figure 7c), as well as for the product complex Au8/O2/CO/MgO(FC) with the CO adsorbed on the deposited cluster (Fig- ure 7b). As expected, the 3s and the nonbonding 4s molecular orbitals of the isolated CO are not in- volved in the bonding to the cluster complex as their energies are not changed upon adsorption. On the other hand, the nonbonding 5s orbital is stabilized by the interaction (by about 3 eV), and thus it contributes to the chemisorption of carbon monoxide to the surface-support- ed complex through hybridization with the metal-cluster orbi- tals. The 1p level is slightly pushed upward in energy (<1 eV).The largest contribution to the bonding of CO to the complex occurs via hybridization of the antibonding 2p* levels of CO and the occupied frontier electronic states of the cluster com- plex. The 2p* orbitals are pushed below the Fermi level, parti- ally populating this molecular state, namely, the so-called back-donation.[47] All these features are also present in the cor- relation diagram of the cluster complex bound to the defect- free MgO surface, where back- donation, however, is less pro- nounced.Electronic Size Effects Understanding the size-depend- ent electronic structure of the Aun/MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c) model catalysts is fundamental for elucidation of their atom-by-atom controlled reactivity. As discussed above,bonding and activation of O2 at the periphery site of the Au8/ MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c) model catalyst is ena- bled by resonances formed be- tween the clusters electronic states and the 2p* molecular states of oxygen. A drastically different scenario is found for the interaction of O2 with a smaller gold cluster, Au4/MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(F5c), where molecular oxygen ad- sorbs in an on-top configuration, with one of the oxygen atoms binding to a single gold atom (not shown).[48] This system exhibits rather weak binding of the molecule to the metal cluster (0.18 eV) and an almost unperturbed OO bond length. The weak binding can be attributed to the narrower d band of the adsorbed Au4 cluster compared to that of Au8,with a consequent lack of overlap between the states at the bottom of the d band of the gold cluster and the molecular Figure 6. Local density of the electronic states (LDOS) of Au8/O2/MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100)FC. For these studies the O2 molecule is adsorbed on the periphery and no CO molecules are co-adsorbed in order to separate the interaction of O2 with the cluster from coupling effects between the reactants. The prominent peaks of the oxygen LDOS are labeled fol- lowing the conventional nomenclature for the molecular orbitals of the gas-phase O2 molecule, with ? and k meaning perpendicular and parallel to the MgO surface, respectively. The Fermi energy is a 0 eV.Figure 7. Local density of states (LDOS) correlation diagrams of a) free CO and b) com- plex Au8/O2/CO/MgO(FC) and c) free Au8/O2/MgO(FC).

oxygen states, with energies E<5 eV. Moreover, the anti- bonding 2p*? and 2p*k orbitals of the adsorbed oxygen mole- cule are located above EF, which results in no activation of the molecule by the adsorbed Au4 cluster. For further details, see ref. [48].Structural Dynamical Fluxionality The capability of small clusters to exhibit several structural forms (isomers) of comparable energies, and to interconvert between such isomers at finite temperature, is one of the hall- marks of cluster science. This unique structural variability may influence the chemical reactivity of nanocatalytic systems in two main ways. First, at finite temperature, the model catalyst will form an equilibrium ensemble of coexisting structural con- figurations, with various isomers exhibiting different chemical reactivities. Second, and most important, is the structural dy- namic fluxionality of clusters, which in the course of reactions expresses itself in the ability of a given structural isomer to dy- namically adapt its structure, such as to allow the reaction to evolve on the most favorable free-energy path. Such a fluxio- nal propensity is illustrated in Figure 5ac, which compares the bare-cluster geometry with those of the gold cluster with adsorbed reactant molecules, and is essential for the reaction to occur, since it was found that constraining the cluster to maintain its original geometry prevents the adsorption and ac- tivation of O2.[14] The Effect of Water As mentioned in the Introduction, for certain supports, mois- ture is able to increase the activity of gold nanocatalysts by about two orders of magnitude.[20] Thus, the influence of water on the chemical activity of gold clusters was recently investi- gated by quantum mechanical ab initio calculations for Au8 ad- sorbed on a defect-free MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) surface,[49] that is, a system that does not exhibit charging effects and is inert to CO oxida- tion (see above). The calculations were based on spin-density functional theory,with generalized gradient corrections (CGA).[50] The wavefunctions are expanded in a plane-wave basis, with a kinetic energy cutoff of 25 Ry. The corevalence interactions for Au, O, and H are described through the use of ultrasoft pseudopotentials,[51] and a norm-conserving pseudo- potential is used for Mg.[52] For further details of the calcula- tions and the determination of the binding energies, the inter- ested reader is referred to the original literature.[49] The influence of water (co)adsorption manifests itself in the calculated change of the oxygen binding energies. For the gold octamer bound to a defect-free MgOACHTUNGTRENUNG(100) surface, two spatial regions for oxygen adsorption may be identified in cal- culations: i) the top facet of the cluster, where O2 adsorbs weakly (adsorption energies up to 0.1 eV), in agreement with the results in refs. [14,23,26], and ii) peripheral sites (at the Au8/MgO interface), where O2 adsorbs with energies between
0.3 and 0.8 eV (Table 2), with the OO bond extended to 1.37
1.49 K. Water adsorbs (relative weakly) on free and supported
Au clusters (Table 2), with adsorption energies that vary from
0.2 to 0.6 eV, and without apparent correlation between the
adsorption strength and the coordination of the adsorption site. Interestingly, it was found that an adsorbed H2O molecule is an attractor for molecular O2, and in the presence of an ad- sorbed water molecule O2 preferentially adsorbs at a neighbor- ing site. Moreover, it may bind even at sites where the adsorp- tion of O2 (without coadsorbed H2O) is energetically unfavora- ble.
In some cases when H2O and O2 coadsorb on the top facet of Au8/MgO, the proton shared by the H2O and O2 molecules may actually be considered as transferred to the O2 species and an OH and a hydroperoxyl-like (HO2) group are formed (for details, see ref. [49]). The distance between the O atoms sharing the proton takes a value of 2.49 K, while the OO hydroperoxyl bond length reaches a value of about 1.48 K (that is, 21% larger than in a free molecule), thus reflecting a very high degree of bond activation. A charge analysis shows that an amount of approximately 0.31 e is transferred from the Au8/MgO system to the coadsorbed species. These results suggest that the coadsorption of H2O and O2 stabilizes the par- tially charged, highly activated states of the adsorbed oxygen molecule. No such bond activation is found for the adsorption of O2 on the top facet of the supported gold octamer without water coadsorption. MgO surfaces are hydrophilic and H2O molecules adsorb with energies of about 0.4 eV. In the vicinity of the peripheral interfacial sites of the Au cluster the calcula- tions show that the adsorption energy of H2O increases by 0.1 to 0.2 eV (depending on the particular site and adsorption con- figuration); thus, the gold cluster acts as an attractor for adsor- bed water (reverse spillover). Hence, at the interface between the Au cluster and the MgO surface, peripheral sites show a high propensity to bind both H2O and O2 (Table 2). The mark- edly larger binding energies of the coadsorbed complex (com- pared to the individual adsorbates) reflect a synergetic effect,expressed through the occurrence of the aforementioned proton-sharing and proton-transfer processes.
To address the reactivity of O2 coadsorbed with H2O on the top facet of the adsorbed gold cluster, a sequence of adsorp- tion and reaction steps that result in the catalytic oxidation of CO is displayed in Figure 8. Starting from the bare Au8/MgO system, an H2O molecule adsorbs first (Figure 8a). Subsequent- ly, an O2 molecule is coadsorbed and the system is exposed to incident
CO
(see the proton-sharing configuration in Figure 8b). In Figure 8c, a proton-transfer process induced by the incoming gaseous CO molecule is shown, which leads to the formation of a hydroperoxyl-like complex. Upon reaction Table 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.chemphyschem.org 1877 CO Combustion on Supported Gold Clusters of the CO molecule with the complex, the proton shuttles back toward the hydroxyl group (Figure 8d), with the process culminating in the desorption of a CO2 molecule and re-forma- tion of an adsorbed H2O molecule that is preferentially orient- ed with respect to the remaining adsorbed oxygen atom (Fig- ure 8e). The above ER-like reaction mechanism involves rela- tively low barriers and the formation of the transition state (Figure 8d) entails a readily accessible energy barrier of
0.5 eV. An added CO molecule reacts readily (a barrier of
0.1 eV) with the single adsorbed oxygen atom, and the (bar-
rierless) desorption of the CO2 product closes the catalytic cycle. For a peripherally adsorbed O2 molecule reacting with a CO molecule adsorbed in its vicinity, a LangmuirHinshelwood reaction barrier of 0.4 eV is found (with or without a neighbor- ing coadsorbed H2O molecule). The barrier for desorption of the CO2 product is 0.6 eV under dry conditions and 0.3 eV with coadsorbed H2O.
Summary The current knowledge of the factors controlling the reactivity of small supported gold clusters at the molecular level has been discussed. It is shown that defect sites in the magnesium oxide support stabilize gold clusters. Whereas Au8/MgO(defect- poor) is found to be inert, Au8/MgO(FC) is highly active for CO oxidation. The key for understanding this change in reactivity is cluster charging. Calculations show that the F center in MgO leads to cluster charging, thus activating oxygen and carbon monoxide molecules adsorbed on Au8. Experimentally, the cluster charging can be observed by a shift in the CO stretch of adsorbed CO. By comparison, no cluster charging is found for Au4/MgO(FC) and inactive catalysts. Another important factor controlling the reactivity of the gold cluster is structural fluxionality. Calculations show that the ability to dynamically adapt its structure, such as allowing the reaction to evolve on the most favorable free-energy path, is essential for its catalytic activity, since constraining the cluster to maintain its original geometry prevents the adsorption and activation of O2. The promotional effect of water can be explained by the formation of an H2OO2 complex, which involves partial proton sharing.
Furthermore, the OO bond is activated, thus facilitating the reaction with CO.
