Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), and cluster models enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. DFT is crucial due to its efficiency in handling the complex systems required for these calculations. The breaking of the CH bond serves as a critical rate-limiting step, which can be compared across different catalysts by calculating the activation energy for this process. However, DFT calculations often fail to accurately represent the electronic structure of oxides, especially for transition and rare-earth metals. To address this, a Hubbard-like correction is sometimes applied, and hybrid functionals like B3LYP or HSE offer improvements over standard DFT. The concept of Lewis acidity and basicity plays a significant role in understanding the interactions between dopants and oxides. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) disrupt chemical bonds, making the doped oxide a better oxidant, while high-valence dopants (HVDs) can affect the reducibility of the host oxide depending on whether it is reducible or irreducible. The role of dopants in disrupting chemical bonds leads to enhanced catalytic activity in alkane activation.

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，极大地增强了我们预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃活化中的催化活性的能力。DFT对于处理这些复杂系统的需求至关重要。确定CH键断裂作为关键的速率限制步骤，可以通过计算此过程的活化能来比较不同催化剂的活性。然而，DFT计算往往无法准确地表示氧化物的电子结构，特别是对于过渡金属和稀土金属。为了应对这一问题，有时会应用类似Hubbard的修正，并且混合功能如B3LYP或HSE在分子和较少的氧化物测试中提供改进。Lewis酸性和基本性概念在理解掺杂剂与氧化物之间的相互作用方面起着重要作用。低价掺杂剂（LVD）破坏化学键，使掺杂氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，而高价掺杂剂（HVD）根据主氧化物是否可还原，可以影响其活性。掺杂剂在破坏化学键的作用导致烷烃活化中的增强催化活性。
