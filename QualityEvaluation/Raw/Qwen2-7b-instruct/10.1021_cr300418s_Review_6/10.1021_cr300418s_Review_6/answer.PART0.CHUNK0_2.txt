Computational methods, especially density functional theory (DFT), significantly enhance our understanding of doped oxide catalysts' catalytic properties in alkane activation by allowing predictions, analyses, and insights into their behavior under reaction conditions. Comparing the activity of different catalysts is achieved through calculating the activation energy for the breaking of the CH bond. Surface modeling typically involves slabs with finite thickness in one direction and periodicity in the other two dimensions. Including van der Waals interactions in DFT calculations is preferable for accurately determining reaction energies. A tentative classification of dopant-oxide pairs is provided: low-valence dopants (LVDs) have a valence lower than the host oxide's cation, making the doped oxide a better oxidant, while high-valence dopants (HVDs) affect the surface's reactivity differently depending on the host oxide's reducibility.

计算方法，尤其是密度泛函理论（DFT），在烷烃激活过程中显著增强了我们对掺杂氧化物催化剂催化性质的理解。通过计算CH键断裂的活化能，可以比较不同催化剂的活性。表面建模通常采用沿一个方向具有有限厚度、在其他两个方向具有周期性的片状结构。为了准确确定反应能量，包括范德华相互作用的DFT计算更优选。对于掺杂剂-氧化物对的分类提供了一个临时方案：低价掺杂剂（LVD）的电荷低于宿主氧化物中的离子，使掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，而高价掺杂剂（HVD）根据宿主氧化物的可还原性对其表面活性产生不同的影响。
