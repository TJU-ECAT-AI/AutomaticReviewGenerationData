Computational methods, notably density functional theory (DFT), and cluster models significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These techniques enable the examination of catalyst behavior under various conditions, allowing for the identification of optimal catalyst compositions and structures. Key considerations include the size of the catalyst particles, as demonstrated by experiments on gas-phase and mass-selected clusters. Challenges stem from limitations in accurately describing van der Waals interactions within DFT calculations, necessitating the incorporation of these interactions for more precise predictions. Moreover, the classification of dopant-oxide pairs, based on the valence of the dopant relative to the host oxide, provides insights into the expected catalytic properties. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) tend to activate oxygen atoms near them, enhancing the oxidative capability of the doped oxide. Conversely, high-valence dopants (HVDs) can influence the reactivity of the oxide surface depending on the reducibility of the host oxide and the valence difference between the dopant and the host cation.

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT），以及簇模型显著增强了我们预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃活化中的催化活性的能力。这些技术允许我们在各种条件下检查催化剂的行为，从而确定最佳催化剂组成和结构。关键考虑因素包括催化剂颗粒的大小，这由气体相和质量选择性簇实验所证明。挑战来自于在DFT计算中准确描述范德华相互作用的限制，需要在更精确的预测中整合这些相互作用。此外，根据掺杂剂与宿主氧化物之间的电荷差异对掺杂剂-氧化物对进行分类，提供了预期催化性能的见解。低电荷掺杂剂（LVD）倾向于激活其附近氧原子，增强掺杂氧化物的氧化能力。相反，高电荷掺杂剂（HVD）根据宿主氧化物的可还原性和掺杂剂与宿主阳离子之间的价差，可以影响表面的反应性。
