[2] "One could imagine trying to use computations to determine the state of the catalyst by creating a large number of models, calculating their free energy, and studying catalysis with the model having the lowest free energy."
[3] "In the case of doped oxide catalysts, there are a number of fundamental, qualitative questions. Among the many possible oxidedopant combinations, which one has the lowest activation energy for breaking the CH bond?"
[4] "The rate-limiting step is the breaking of the CH bond. One can compare the activity of different catalysts for this process by calculating the activation energy for CH bond breaking."
[5] "If they are promising, the experimentalists might attempt to synthesize them."
[6] "In calculating reaction energies, some of the van der Waals interactions cancel out but not completely. It is therefore preferable to use versions of DFT that include the van der Waals interaction, but this has been done infrequently for oxides."
[7] "The rule we found by examining the results of many calculations is that if we coadsorb on the surface of an oxide a Lewis base with a Lewis acid, the binding energy of the pair exceeds substantially the sum of the binding energy of the compounds alone on the same surface."

Computational methods, especially density functional theory (DFT), significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. By creating numerous models and calculating their free energy, we can determine the most effective catalyst. For doped oxide catalysts, identifying the combination with the lowest activation energy for breaking the CH bond is crucial. Comparing the activation energy for CH bond breaking among different catalysts helps in assessing their activity. The computational prediction of promising materials allows experimentalists to synthesize them. Incorporating van der Waals interactions into DFT calculations improves the accuracy of reaction energy predictions. The discovery that coadsorbing a Lewis base with a Lewis acid on the surface significantly increases their binding energy provides a useful rule for guiding the design of catalysts.
