[1] "From the model, it emerges that ferromagnets can be divided into type I and type II for high and low values of TC/μat, respectively."
[2] "When a laser pulse hits the sample of a type I material it creates an excitation, increasing the temperature of the electron system."
[3] "This two-step process is a consequence of the different temperature of the electron system in the first picosecond and thereafter."
[4] "One of the consequences of spinorbit coupling in the solid-state material is that in some points of the Fermi surface the spin is not well defined and consists of a mixture of the dominant spin direction and a small part of the opposite one."
[5] "Assuming this mechanism, Koopmans and coauthors estimated the values of asf for Ni and Co by ab initio calculations, and found that these values agreed very well with those used to describe the demagnetization curves."
[6] "The progress towards a quantitative understanding of demagnetization will make femtosecond magnetization dynamics a valuable tool for materials characterization without the need for electrical contacts."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the mechanisms of spin-orbit coupling and spin-flip scattering. These methods allow for the estimation of values related to the demagnetization curve, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of ferromagnetic materials under laser excitation. The accurate prediction of these parameters enables the development of quantitative models that can predict the response of ferromagnetic materials to external stimuli, such as laser pulses. This advancement facilitates the exploration of new catalytic materials and their properties without the need for experimental setups that require electrical contacts. The key considerations involve ensuring the reliability of computational models, optimizing computational resources for efficiency, and validating theoretical predictions against experimental data to address potential challenges in achieving high accuracy and broad applicability.
