[1] "Previously, there have only been three room temperature experimental determinations of the rate coefficient of OH with 1-pentene. A high pressure relative rate determination at 735 Torr by Atkinson and Aschmann,21 a low pressure 2 Torr flow study by Biermann et al.,14 and a flash photolysis study carried out at 55 Torr by Nip and Parakesvopolous,22 which are within experimental error with this study."
[2] "Furthermore,the results are in agreement over the pressure range of 2 735 Torr which indicates that measured rate coefficients are at the high pressure limit, as shown in Fig. 4a."
[3] "The rate coefficient for the reaction of OH was also studied over the temperature range 262300 K. From the data in Table 1 it is possible to carry out Arrhenius type analysis of the temperature dependence yielding an Arrhenius expression as summarised in Table 2."
[4] "For all compounds studied, the rate coefficient displayed a negative temperature dependence,i.e. rate increases as the temperature is lowered, as shown in Fig. 4ad."
[5] "The negative temperature dependence is indicative of a complex mode reaction, i.e. that it proceeds through the formation of an energised OHalkene adduct."
[6] "However, hydrogen abstraction is also known to occur9,11,14 and one would expect a positive temperature dependence for such an element reaction."
[7] "An investigation of the overall kinetics as a function of temperature provides indirect evidence of the reaction pathways that are operating."
[8] "The largest reported activation energy is that for 1-decene, which is based on a fit to the three highest temperatures, i.e. only accounting for the addition pathway."
[9] "The retrieved activation energy is (3170  118) K, which is similar to the range of activation energy measurements reported for ethene, which range from 3200 to 4790 K24 where only the addition pathway operates."
[10] "Theoretical calculations were undertaken to investigate the reactivity of OH towards CH bonds in long chain 1-alkenes."
[11] "To assess the reactivity towards CH bond activation of these n-alkenes, one must consider the four different types of H-atom: those on the CH Q CH2 alkene group, those in the allylic CH2 position adjacent to the double bond, those in the other internal CH2 positions along the chain, and those on the terminal CH3 group."
[12] "Our previous computational study26 gave a calculated rate constant for abstraction from each methyl group of ethane and propane,respectively, of 0.12 and 0.10  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1, in reasonable agreement with the SAR."
[13] "Compared to other channels available for reaction with the present 1-alkenes, this contribution is negligible."
[14] "For the internal CH2 groups other than the allylic position,the SAR25 predicts a contribution to the rate constant of ca. 1012 cm3 molecule1 s1."
[15] "A similar rate constant can be expected for each of the internal CH2 groups in the n-alkenes considered here."
[16] "The allylic CH2 group is expected to be more reactive due to developing resonance between the forming radical centre and the double bond in the transition state for CH bond abstraction."
[17] "This effect is not taken into account in the SAR model.25"
[18] "We have carried out calculations on the model OH + 1-butene reaction at the same KMLYP/6-311+G** level of theory27,28 as used in our previous study."
[19] "The transition state for abstraction of the allylic H atom, shown in Fig. 5, lies 1.84 kJ mol1 below the energy of the reactants, as compared with a TS lying 3.18 kJ mol1 above the reactants for the secondary H atom in propane."
[20] "Taking this correction into account, and applying the same simple transition state theory as in the previous work,26 leads to a predicted rate coefficient for CH bond abstraction from the allylic position of 1.70  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K."
[21] "Although the approximation of additive contributions from the different groups means that the predicted values are somewhat inaccurate, this suggests that abstraction plays a small but non-negligible role in the overall reaction."
[22] "Assuming additive rate coefficients with a value of 1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 for each internal CH2 group leads to total predicted rate coefficients for CH bond abstraction for 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene and 1-undecene of, respectively"
[23] "2.7, 5.7, 7.7 and 8.7  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K."
[24] "Although the approximation of additive contributions from the different groups means that the predicted values are somewhat inaccurate, this suggests that abstraction plays a small but non-negligible role in the overall reaction."
[25] "For the reaction of OH with 1-decene the Arrhenius parameters for the addition pathway were estimated from a linear fit of the Arrhenius plot for the experimentally determined rate coefficients studied at 268, 278 and 286 K, as shown in Fig. 4d."
[26] "Then the impact of the abstraction pathway on the overall rate coefficient can be evaluated using the estimated activation energy calculated by the KMLYP/6-311+G** calculations."
[27] "The solid line is the predicted total rate coefficient i.e. (kabstraction  kaddition)."
[28] "Thus, our results would indicate that the abstraction pathway does operate for the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes."
[29] "The work of Atkinson and Aschmann21 was a relative rate study and used the reaction between OH and propene as the reference compound, taking a rate coefficient of 2.63 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 for this reference reaction."
[30] "There have been numerous studies of this reference reaction with a wide range of rate coefficients obtained (approx. 1.53.0 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1)."
[31] "However, a very recent study by Spangenberg et al.,31 using a pulsed laval nozzle returned a rate coefficient at 295 K of 2.39  1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 and, in conjunction with the relative rates obtained by Atkinson and Aschmann21 (also at 295 K), a revised set of rate coefficients for 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also tabulated."
[32] "First, the general agreement between the studies of the reaction of OH with 1-pentene is good (noted previously)."
[33] "The agreement is improved slightly by adopting the most recent determination for the rate coefficient for the reaction of OH with propene, but this is a minor point."
[34] "The rate coefficient predicted by the SAR for 1-pentene is slightly higher than the experimental determinations."
[35] "The rate coefficients for the reaction of OH with 1-hexene and 1-heptene measured using the relative rate method21 are slightly larger than our rate coefficient for the reaction with 1-octene, which is clearly out of place."
[36] "However, the measured rate coefficients for 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also higher than the SAR prediction, and upon using the more recent rate coefficient for propene (the reference reaction in both systems) these rate coefficients are smaller than the value obtained in this study for 1-octene and more in line with the SAR prediction."
[37] "The rate coefficient for the reaction of 1-nonene with OH is about 4% larger than the SAR prediction."
[38] "However, there is a clear departure from agreement between the SAR and this work for 1-decene and 1-undecene, where the rate coefficients returned are a factor of 1.7 and 2.9 larger than that predicted by the SAR."
[39] "We rule out the possibility of a reactive impurity in the samples of 1-decene (3% maximum) and 1-undecene (3% maximum) biasing these results."
[40] "It is often suggested that wall activity is enhanced, leading to increased loss of OH when larger-than-expected rate coefficients are returned, however, the OH wall loss rate is extremely small with and without the presence of the reactant and there is nothing to suggest heightened wall activity."
[41] "The curved Ar- rhenius plot for 1-decene is surely an indication that the abstraction channel is becoming important in these higher molecular weight systems and may in part be the reason for the departure between measured and predicted rate coefficients."
[42] "We are unable to quantify the branching ratios for these systems with the current experimental set up but we note the following points."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing theoretical insights into the reactivity of CH bonds and the impact of various substitution groups on the overall rate coefficient. These methods allow for the assessment of reactivity towards CH bond activation across different alkene structures, considering the four types of H-atoms present. The calculations yield rate constants for abstraction reactions, indicating that abstraction plays a small but non-negligible role in the overall reaction, especially for the allylic CH2 group. Theoretical studies also highlight the discrepancies between SAR predictions and experimental data for higher molecular weight alkenes, suggesting that the kinetics of these systems are more complex and require further investigation. The accuracy and efficiency of these computational approaches are influenced by factors such as the level of theory used (e.g., KMLYP/6-311+G**), the approximation of additive contributions from different groups, and the adequacy of transition state theory in predicting activation energies and rate coefficients. These methods offer valuable tools for the exploration of new catalytic materials and mechanisms, enabling the prediction of reaction pathways and the identification of catalysts with enhanced activity or selectivity for alkane activation.
