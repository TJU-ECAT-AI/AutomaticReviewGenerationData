[1] "The data shown in Fig. 3 are for experiments carried out at two different pressures at 298 K."
[2] "The rate coefficient for the reaction of OH was also studied over the temperature range 262300 K."
[3] "The rate coefficient displayed a negative temperature dependence,i.e. rate increases as the temperature is lowered, as shown in Fig. 4ad."
[4] "Our data indicates that the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes has a significant negative temperature dependence."
[5] "For the reaction of OH with 1-decene, the Arrhenius plot was non-linear, indicating that the abstraction pathway makes an appreciable contribution towards the overall rate of reaction."
[6] "KMLYP/6-311+G** theoretical studies were performed to assess the reactivity of the CH bond and its impact on overall rate coefficient."
[7] "It was found that the abstraction pathway will operate."
[8] "However, more studies are needed to directly quantify the addition and abstraction pathways utilizing experimental techniques that can measure directly the OHalkene adduct produced via addition or the alkyl radical produce via abstraction, such as Ultra-Violet photoelectron spectroscopy."
