[1] "Previously, there have only been three room temperature experimental determinations of the rate coefficient of OH with 1-pentene. A high pressure relative rate determination at 735 Torr by Atkinson and Aschmann,21 a low pressure 2 Torr flow study by Biermann et al.,14 and a flash photolysis study carried out at 55 Torr by Nip and Parakesvopolous,22 which are within experimental error with this study."
[2] "Furthermore,the results are in agreement over the pressure range of 2 735 Torr which indicates that measured rate coefficients are at the high pressure limit, as shown in Fig. 4a."
[3] "The rate coefficient for the reaction of OH was also studied over the temperature range 262300 K. From the data in Table 1 it is possible to carry out Arrhenius type analysis of the temperature dependence yielding an Arrhenius expression as summarised in Table 2."
[4] "For all compounds studied, the rate coefficient displayed a negative temperature dependence,i.e. rate increases as the temperature is lowered, as shown in Fig. 4ad."
[5] "The negative temperature dependence is indicative of a complex mode reaction, i.e. that it proceeds through the formation of an energised OHalkene adduct."
[6] "However, hydrogen abstraction is also known to occur9,11,14 and one would expect a positive temperature dependence for such an element reaction."
[7] "An investigation of the overall kinetics as a function of temperature provides indirect evidence of the reaction pathways that are operating."
[8] "The largest reported activation energy is that for 1-decene, which is based on a fit to the three highest temperatures, i.e. only accounting for the addition pathway."
[9] "The retrieved activation energy is (3170  118) K, which is similar to the range of activation energy measurements reported for ethene, which range from 3200 to 4790 K24 where only the addition pathway operates."
[10] "Theoretical calculations were undertaken to investigate the reactivity of OH towards CH bonds in long chain 1-alkenes."
[11] "To assess the reactivity towards CH bond activation of these n-alkenes, one must consider the four different types of H-atom: those on the CH Q CH2 alkene group, those in the allylic CH2 position adjacent to the double bond, those in the other internal CH2 positions along the chain, and those on the terminal CH3 group."
[12] "Our previous computational study26 gave a calculated rate constant for abstraction from each methyl group of ethane and propane,respectively, of 0.12 and 0.10  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1, in reasonable agreement with the SAR."
[13] "Compared to other channels available for reaction with the present 1-alkenes, this contribution is negligible."
[14] "For the internal CH2 groups other than the allylic position,the SAR25 predicts a contribution to the rate constant of ca. 1012 cm3 molecule1 s1."
[15] "A similar rate constant can be expected for each of the internal CH2 groups in the n-alkenes considered here."
[16] "The allylic CH2 group is expected to be more reactive due to developing resonance between the forming radical centre and the double bond in the transition state for CH bond abstraction."
[17] "This effect is not taken into account in the SAR model.25"
[18] "We have carried out calculations on the model OH + 1-butene reaction at the same KMLYP/6-311+G** level of theory27,28 as used in our previous study."
[19] "The transition state for abstraction of the allylic H atom, shown in Fig. 5, lies 1.84 kJ mol1 below the energy of the reactants, as compared with a TS lying 3.18 kJ mol1 above the reactants for the secondary H atom in propane."
[20] "Taking this correction into account, and applying the same simple transition state theory as in the previous work,26 leads to a predicted rate coefficient for CH bond abstraction from the allylic position of 1.70  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K."
[21] "Although the approximation of additive contributions from the different groups means that the predicted values are somewhat inaccurate, this suggests that abstraction plays a small but non-negligible role in the overall reaction."
[22] "Assuming additive rate coefficients with a value of 1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 for each internal CH2 group leads to total predicted rate coefficients for CH bond abstraction for 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-decene and 1-undecene of, respectively"
[23] "2.7, 5.7, 7.7 and 8.7  1012 cm3 molecule1 s1 at 298 K."
[24] "Although the approximation of additive contributions from the different groups means that the predicted values are somewhat inaccurate, this suggests that abstraction plays a small but non-negligible role in the overall reaction."
[25] "For the reaction of OH with 1-decene the Arrhenius parameters for the addition pathway were estimated from a linear fit of the Arrhenius plot for the experimentally determined rate coefficients studied at 268, 278 and 286 K, as shown in Fig. 4d."
[26] "Then the impact of the abstraction pathway on the overall rate coefficient can be evaluated using the estimated activation energy calculated by the KMLYP/6-311+G** calculations."
[27] "The solid line is the predicted total rate coefficient i.e. (kabstraction  kaddition)."
[28] "Thus, our results would indicate that the abstraction pathway does operate for the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes."
[29] "The work of Atkinson and Aschmann21 was a relative rate study and used the reaction between OH and propene as the reference compound, taking a rate coefficient of 2.63 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 for this reference reaction."
[30] "There have been numerous studies of this reference reaction with a wide range of rate coefficients obtained (approx. 1.53.0 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1)."
[31] "However, a very recent study by Spangenberg et al.,31 using a pulsed laval nozzle returned a rate coefficient at 295 K of 2.39  1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 and, in conjunction with the relative rates obtained by Atkinson and Aschmann21 (also at 295 K), a revised set of rate coefficients for 1-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also tabulated."
[32] "First, the general agreement between the studies of the reaction of OH with 1-pentene is good (noted previously)."
[33] "The agreement is improved slightly by adopting the most recent determination for the rate coefficient for the reaction of OH with propene, but this is a minor point."
[34] "The rate coefficient predicted by the SAR for 1-pentene is slightly higher than the experimental determinations."
[35] "The rate coefficients for the reaction of OH with 1-hexene and 1-heptene measured using the relative rate method21 are slightly larger than our rate coefficient for the reaction with 1-octene, which is clearly out of place."
[36] "However, the measured rate coefficients for 1-hexene and 1-heptene are also higher than the SAR prediction, and upon using the more recent rate coefficient for propene (the reference reaction in both systems) these rate coefficients are smaller than the value obtained in this study for 1-octene and more in line with the SAR prediction."
[37] "The rate coefficient for the reaction of 1-nonene with OH is about 4% larger than the SAR prediction."
[38] "However, there is a clear departure from agreement between the SAR and this work for 1-decene and 1-undecene, where the rate coefficients returned are a factor of 1.7 and 2.9 larger than that predicted by the SAR."
[39] "We rule out the possibility of a reactive impurity in the samples of 1-decene (3% maximum) and 1-undecene (3% maximum) biasing these results."
[40] "It is often suggested that wall activity is enhanced, leading to increased loss of OH when larger-than-expected rate coefficients are returned, however, the OH wall loss rate is extremely small with and without the presence of the reactant and there is nothing to suggest heightened wall activity."
[41] "The curved Ar- rhenius plot for 1-decene is surely an indication that the abstraction channel is becoming important in these higher molecular weight systems and may in part be the reason for the departure between measured and predicted rate coefficients."
[42] "We are unable to quantify the branching ratios for these systems with the current experimental set up but we note the following points."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing theoretical insights into the reactivity of CH bonds and the impact of various substitution groups on the overall rate coefficient. These methods allow for the assessment of reactivity towards CH bond activation across different alkene structures, considering the four types of H-atoms present. The calculations yield rate constants for abstraction reactions, indicating that abstraction plays a small but non-negligible role in the overall reaction, especially for the allylic CH2 group. Theoretical studies also highlight the discrepancies between SAR predictions and experimental data for higher molecular weight alkenes, suggesting that the kinetics of these systems are more complex and require further investigation. The accuracy and efficiency of these computational approaches are influenced by factors such as the level of theory used (e.g., KMLYP/6-311+G**), the approximation of additive contributions from different groups, and the adequacy of transition state theory in predicting activation energies and rate coefficients. These methods offer valuable tools for the exploration of new catalytic materials and mechanisms, enabling the prediction of reaction pathways and the identification of catalysts with enhanced activity or selectivity for alkane activation.

<p>Overall rate coefficients for these reactions are poorly con- strained for long chain alkenes, especially with regards to their temperature and pressure dependence. Previous measurements of Cr4 alkenes exhibit a strong pressure dependence8 and a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence,911 which results from the formation of an energy-rich OH-alkene adduct.</p>
<p>Reaction time was varied by introducing the 1-alkene reactant at known distances along the flow tube using a 4 mm i.d. Pyrex movable injector. To ensure rapid mixing of reactants, a turbulizer (a propeller- shaped Teflon nozzle) was placed at the end of the injector,and reaction times were calculated using the linear flow velocity and the distance between the tip of this injector and the ionmolecule region (where reactions are considered to be so rapid as to be practically instantaneous).</p>
<p>The temperature of the flow tube was controlled to within 2 K by flowing a coolant (Texaco Havoline LC + B0F02) at the desired temperature through the jacket on the exterior of the flow tube using a circulating cooler (NESLAB RTE 8). The nitrogen carrier gas was pre-cooled to the same temperature by passing it through a copper coil immersed in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>OH radicals were produced upstream of the flow tube via the reaction.</p>
<p>Using this method it was found that on average 20% of H2 was dissociated into H atoms. Thus under normal operating conditions the initial concentration of OH radicals formed from the reaction of hydrogen atoms in the flow tube ranged from (110)  1010 molecules cm3.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 3b, the values k1st are then plotted vs. [RH],which is determined directly from the known concentration in the mixture flowing through the calibrated flow meter.</p>
<p>Previously, there have only been three room tempera- ture experimental determinations of the rate coefficient of OH with 1-pentene. A high pressure relative rate determination at 735 Torr by Atkinson and Aschmann,21 a low pressure 2 Torr flow study by Biermann et al.,14 and a flash photolysis study carried out at 55 Torr by Nip and Parakesvopolous,22 which are within experimental error with this study. Furthermore,the results are in agreement over the pressure range of 2 735 Torr which indicates that measured rate coefficients are at the high pressure limit, as shown in Fig. 4a.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note from this data that rate coefficients increase rapidly up the homologous series from C511. Tem- perature dependence is also enhanced over this rangea phenomenon that can also be observed in the smaller terminal alkenes10 and for other addition reactions such as the reaction of OH + RCHO24and in the case of the terminal alkenes,appears to exhibit an exponential dependence upon carbon number.</p>
<p>For the reaction of OH with 1-decene the Arrhenius para- meters for the addition pathway were estimated from a linear fit of the Arrhenius plot for the experimentally determined rate coefficients studied at 268, 278 and 286 K, as shown in Fig. 4d.</p>
<p>First, the general agreement between the studies of the reaction of OH with 1-pentene is good (noted previously).</p>
<p>Atmospheric implications Direct addition to the double bond will lead to the formation of a peroxy radical of the form CH2(OH)CH(O2)R and on reaction with NO, NO3 or other peroxy radicals will yield an alkoxy radical CH2(OH)CH(O)R, which is likely to decompose to HCHO, HO2 and RCHO on reaction with O2. The products so formed will enhance ozone formation in the presence of NOx, since RCHO and HCHO are reactive species that also have an appreciable photolytic decomposition rate, leading to further peroxy radical formation.</p>
<p>KMLYP/ 6-311+G** theoretical studies were performed to assess the reactivity of the CH bond and its impact on overall rate coefficient. It was found that the abstraction pathway will operate. However, more studies are needed to directly quantify the addition and abstraction pathways utilising experimental techniques that can measure directly the OHalkene adduct produced via addition or the alkyl radical produce via abstrac- tion, such as Ultra-Violet photoelectron spectroscopy.</p>
<p>Our data indicates that the reaction of OH with 1-alkenes has a significant negative temperature dependence. The results represent the first evaluation of the kinetics of the reaction of OH with 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and 1-decene. Over the temperature range studied, the rate coefficient for reaction was found to be invariant with pressure, suggesting that the rate coefficient is at the high pressure limit. For the reaction of OH with 1-decene, the Arrhenius plot was non-linear, indicat- ing that the abstraction pathway makes an appreciable con- tribution towards the overall rate of reaction.</p>

<p>However, there is also the possibility that hyperconjugation rather than abstraction is the cause of rate coefficients enhancement, as suggested by Canosa-Mas et al.,12 and more recently reiterated by Pfrang et al.13 To probe further the importance of the abstraction path- way, experimental and theoretical studies have been under- taken to investigate the kinetics of the reaction of OH with a series of 1-alkenes (i.e. 1-pentene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and 1-decene) as a function of pressure and temperature.</p>
<p>The reaction of alkenes with OH radicals is of great impor- tance to atmospheric chemistry, and under certain low NOx conditions, represents the dominant tropospheric sink for HOx.1 This is the result of typically fast rates of reaction coupled with high alkene concentrations present in the tropo- sphere.24 Higher molecular weight alkenessuch as those studied in this workare observed frequently in the urban troposphere5 and have been detected in motor vehicle emis- sions,6 furthermore, the lack of resolution inherent in standard single-column chromatographic apparatus may have resulted in significant underestimations of the concentration of C46 compounds in the urban atmosphere.7 Reaction of alkenes with OH proceeds via two pathways, the most important of which is considered to be the addition channel, as shown in Fig. 1a. A second reaction pathway also exists, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from an alkyl group substituent to an olefinic bond, as shown in Fig. 1b.</p>
<p>Overall rate coefficients for these reactions are poorly con- strained for long chain alkenes, especially with regards to their temperature and pressure dependence. Previous measurements of Cr4 alkenes exhibit a strong pressure dependence8 and a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence,911 which results from the formation of an energy-rich OH-alkene adduct.</p>
<p>In order to assess the impact of the abstraction reaction pathway theoretical studies were undertaken to investigate the reactivity of OH towards CH bonds in long chain 1-alkenes.

CH2 alkene group, those in the allylic CH2 position adjacent to the double bond, those in the other internal CH2 positions along the chain, and those on the terminal CH3 group.</p>
<p>For the reaction of OH with 1-decene the Arrhenius para- meters for the addition pathway were estimated from a linear fit of the Arrhenius plot for the experimentally determined rate coefficients studied at 268, 278 and 286 K, as shown in Fig. 4d.</p>

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by allowing us to simulate and explore the electronic structures, energetics, and dynamics of these systems at the atomic level. Key considerations involve the choice of appropriate functionals and basis sets in DFT calculations, the use of advanced electronic structure methods like density functional tight binding (DFTB) for efficiency, and the incorporation of quantum chemical effects such as hyperconjugation and charge transfer interactions.

2. The main challenges in using computational methods for this purpose include achieving accurate predictions that match experimental observations, dealing with the complexity of multi-component systems, and addressing the computational cost associated with large-scale simulations. Efficiency is improved by employing approximations, simplified models, and parallel computing techniques.

3. Potential benefits of computational approaches in terms of accuracy come from the ability to systematically vary parameters, explore a wider range of conditions, and identify optimal catalyst designs that might not be accessible through experimental methods alone. Exploration of new catalytic materials can be facilitated by computational screening strategies that prioritize candidates based on theoretical predictions.

4. In terms of the specific context of alkane activation, computational methods allow for detailed investigation of the mechanisms involved in the reaction pathways, including both addition and abstraction processes, by calculating activation barriers, reaction intermediates, and transition states. This helps in understanding the role of various substituents and their impact on reactivity.

5. The document provides examples of how theoretical calculations can estimate the rate of abstraction from different types of hydrogens in long-chain alkene molecules, which is crucial for assessing the impact of abstraction pathways on overall reaction kinetics. These calculations can predict the contribution of abstraction to the overall rate constant, thereby providing insights into the relative importance of different reaction channels.

6. The Arrhenius parameters for the addition pathway of the reaction of OH with 1-decene were estimated using experimental data. This approach allows for the quantification of the temperature dependence of the reaction, which is essential for understanding its behavior under varying conditions. The inclusion of an abstraction pathway in the theoretical model improves the fit to the experimental rate coefficients, indicating that abstraction plays a role in the reaction.
