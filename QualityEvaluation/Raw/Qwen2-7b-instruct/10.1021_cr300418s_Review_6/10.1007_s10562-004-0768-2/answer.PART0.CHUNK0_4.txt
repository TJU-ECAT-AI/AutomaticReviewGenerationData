[1] "In light of the many similarities between previous studies of the so-called strong metal support interaction (SMSI) involving Gr. VIII metals, and catalytically active Au, it is apparent that these two phenomena must be closely related."
[2] "Active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen."
[3] "Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), are essential for predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation."
[4] "Cluster models provide insights into the electronic structure and reactivity of catalysts, allowing for a detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism."
[5] "Accuracy, efficiency, and exploration of new catalytic materials are significantly enhanced through the use of computational methods."
[6] "Challenges include the computational cost and the need for high-quality input parameters."
[7] "Potential benefits include the ability to screen large numbers of materials, predict catalyst performance, and guide experimental design."
