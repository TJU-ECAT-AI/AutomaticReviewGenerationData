Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen.

Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI. This temperature has been shown to be sufficient to create surface defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2.

Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal.

With SMSI, electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal.

When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals.

For an active Au/TiO2 model catalyst, core level shifts measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with electron transfer from titania to Au leading to electron-rich Au.

Density functional calculations also are consistent with Au being electron-rich when supported on titania.

An enhancement of reduced titania species for the active catalyst compared to a deactivated catalyst due to the critical role of defect sites in the wetting of titania by Au.

An increase in the Ti feature in low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) as a function of anneal temperature, interpreted as migration of TiOx onto the metal.

For Au on titania, an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the TiOx support causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au.
