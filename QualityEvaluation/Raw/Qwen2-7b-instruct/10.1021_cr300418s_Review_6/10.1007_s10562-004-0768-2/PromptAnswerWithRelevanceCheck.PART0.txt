(1) "Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies (figure 1) with catalytic activity for CO oxidation [1]."
(2) "Furthermore oxygen either alone or in a reaction mixture has been shown to promote sintering of these bilayer Au structures (figure 3) [1]."
(3) "A recent model study [16] of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes access of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation (figure 4)."
(4) "A key feature of Au grown on TiOx/Mo(112) is the strength of the interaction between the overlayer Au and the support comprised of strong bonding between Au and reduced Ti atoms of the TiOx support, yielding electron-rich Au [16]."
(5) "These recent studies are entirely consistent with recent theoretical studies [17] that show the importance of reduced Ti defect sites at the boundary between Au clusters and a TiO2 interface in determining the Au cluster shape and electronic properties via transfer of charge from the support to Au [18]."
(6) "Finally a recent theoretical study [19] has shown that a Au-only reaction pathway for a TiOx supported Au bilayer cluster is energetically competitive with alternative pathways requiring reactant-support interactions."
(7) "Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal [34]. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of model Au/TiO2 catalysts have shown that Au wets titania subsequent to an anneal to 800 K [1]."
(8) "For an active Au/TiO2 model catalyst, core level shifts measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with electron transfer from titania to Au leading to electron-rich Au [3]."
(9) "Density functional calculations also are consistent with Au being electron-rich when supported on titania [18,39]."
(10) "That is, a similar electronic interaction between the metal and the support for Au compared to Gr. VIII metals may produce a decidedly different chemical (catalytic) result."
(11) "Assuming this accumulation of defects at the cluster-support interface occurs as well during SMSI formation, this could easily be interpreted as TiOx formation on the cluster because the metal bilayer structure that we now know forms on TiO2 is relatively transparent to electron probes such as XPS."
(12) "Likewise, an increase in the Ti feature in low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) as a function of anneal temperature, interpreted as migration of TiOx onto the metal, could be simply due to the improved accessibility of the probe ions to Ti because of the decrease in the oxygen stoichiometry during reduction."

Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen.

Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K is the typical condition required to induce SMSI. This temperature has been shown to be sufficient to create surface defects in model studies of single crystal TiO2.

Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal.

With SMSI, electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal.

When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals.

For an active Au/TiO2 model catalyst, core level shifts measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with electron transfer from titania to Au leading to electron-rich Au.

Density functional calculations also are consistent with Au being electron-rich when supported on titania.

An enhancement of reduced titania species for the active catalyst compared to a deactivated catalyst due to the critical role of defect sites in the wetting of titania by Au.

An increase in the Ti feature in low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) as a function of anneal temperature, interpreted as migration of TiOx onto the metal.

For Au on titania, an oxidizing environment re-oxidizes the TiOx support causing de-wetting and sintering of the Au.

Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen.
Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies with catalytic activity for CO oxidation.
A recent model study of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes access of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation.
In the late seventies and eighties, considerable attention was given to the unusual properties of metals supported on TiO2 when reduced at relatively high temperatures, results first reported by Tauster et al. for supported Pt and Ir, and designated as strong metal-support interaction (SMSI).
Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal, specifically Au. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of model Au/TiO2 catalysts have shown that Au wets titania subsequent to an anneal to 800 K.
With SMSI, electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal.
When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals. On the other hand, for an active Au/TiO2 catalyst, CO chemisorption is enhanced.
Oxidative environments reoxidize the reduced TiOx support and reverse the SMSI effect.
There is one outstanding discrepancy in the comparison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties.
Future work on catalytically active Au on TiO2 and other supports known to activate Au should be considered in the context of the extensive SMSI literature of the last 30 years.
