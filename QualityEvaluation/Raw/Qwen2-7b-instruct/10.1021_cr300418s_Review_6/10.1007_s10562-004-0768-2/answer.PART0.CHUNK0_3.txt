Catalytically active Au on titania spreads to form a bilayer structure, is electron-rich as determined by theory and experiment, nucleates on reduced Ti defects created by annealing to temperatures >750 K, and is deactivated via sintering in oxygen.
Early work on model Au clusters supported on TiO2(110) correlated the presence of Au bilayer cluster morphologies with catalytic activity for CO oxidation.
A recent model study of Au on a highly reduced TiOx ordered film grown on Mo(112) has demonstrated that a coordinatively unsaturated, continuous Au bilayer structure that precludes access of the reactant to the support, exhibits an exceptional high activity for catalytic CO oxidation.
In the late seventies and eighties, considerable attention was given to the unusual properties of metals supported on TiO2 when reduced at relatively high temperatures, results first reported by Tauster et al. for supported Pt and Ir, and designated as strong metal-support interaction (SMSI).
Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal, specifically Au. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of model Au/TiO2 catalysts have shown that Au wets titania subsequent to an anneal to 800 K.
With SMSI, electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal.
When induced, SMSI leads to suppression of H2 and CO chemisorption for various metals. On the other hand, for an active Au/TiO2 catalyst, CO chemisorption is enhanced.
Oxidative environments reoxidize the reduced TiOx support and reverse the SMSI effect.
There is one outstanding discrepancy in the comparison of SMSI and catalytically active Au. This discrepancy is the assertion that SMSI arises from migration of a reduced TiOx, perhaps TiO, onto the supported metal causing inhibition of chemisorption and modified catalytic properties.
Future work on catalytically active Au on TiO2 and other supports known to activate Au should be considered in the context of the extensive SMSI literature of the last 30 years.

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by allowing us to simulate and interpret the electronic structure and interactions within the system. Key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical models, the efficiency of computational resources, and the exploration of new catalytic materials. Challenges involve balancing computational complexity with practical limitations and interpreting the results within the context of real-world conditions. Potential benefits include precise prediction of catalytic performance, optimization of catalyst design, and understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern catalytic activity. The application of these methods is crucial in advancing the field of catalysis, particularly in the context of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which involves complex interplay between metals and oxide supports. Future work on catalytically active Au on TiO2 should leverage the extensive SMSI literature to gain deeper insights into the origins of unique properties and to uncover remaining mysteries associated with the SMSI effect.
