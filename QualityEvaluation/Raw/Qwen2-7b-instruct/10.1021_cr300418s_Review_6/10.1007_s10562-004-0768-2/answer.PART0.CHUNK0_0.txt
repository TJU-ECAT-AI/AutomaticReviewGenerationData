(2) Inducement of SMSI leads to wetting of the support by the metal [34]. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of model Au/TiO2 catalysts have shown that Au wets titania subsequent to an anneal to 800 K [1].
(3) With SMSI electron transfer occurs from titania to the supported metal yielding an electron-rich metal

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the electronic structure and bonding mechanisms. DFT calculations allow for the simulation of the electronic states of the catalyst surface, enabling the prediction of adsorption energies, activation barriers, and reaction pathways. Cluster models further refine this analysis by focusing on specific reactive sites, offering detailed information on how dopants influence the catalytic performance. Key considerations involve the accuracy of the exchange-correlation functional, the computational cost, and the ability to explore a wide range of materials and conditions. Potential benefits include the identification of novel catalysts, optimization of existing ones, and the understanding of complex catalytic mechanisms that are difficult to study experimentally.
