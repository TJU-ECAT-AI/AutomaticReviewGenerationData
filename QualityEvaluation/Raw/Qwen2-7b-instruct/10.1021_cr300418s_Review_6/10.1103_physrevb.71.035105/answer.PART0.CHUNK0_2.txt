The last term in the above equation is then sub- tracted in order to avoid double counting of the interactions contained both in EHub and, in some average way, in ELDA. In this term the total, spin-projected, occupation of the localized manifold is used: nIs=omnm Is.

1. The LDA+U method, introduced by Anisimov and colleagues, aims to explicitly account for the on-site Coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insulators by adding a Hubbard-like interaction term to the standard functional. This term, EHub, is defined as EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is), where EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j. The last term is subtracted to avoid double counting of interactions and uses the total, spin-projected, occupation of the localized manifold, nIs=∑m nm Is.

1. 安西莫夫和同事引入的LDA+U方法旨在通过向标准函数中添加Hubbard-like相互作用项来明确地考虑Mott绝缘体中的局域电荷关联间隙。该项定义为EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is)，其中EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j。最后一项用于避免重复计算相互作用，并使用局部化能级的总，自旋投影，占据数nIs=∑m nm Is。

In order to fully define how the approach works the first thing to do is to select the degrees of freedom on which Hubbard U will operate and define the corresponding oc- cupation matrix nmm8 Is . Although it is usually straightforward to identify in a given system the atomic levels to be treated in a special way sthe d electrons in transition metals and the f ones in the rare earths and actinides seriesd there is no unique or rigorous way to define occupation of localized atomic levels in a multiatom system. Equally legitimate choices for nmm8 Is are sid projections on normalized atomic orbitals, siid projections on Wannier functions whenever the relevant orbitals give raise to isolated band manifolds, siiid Mulliken population, or sivd integrated values in ssphericald regions around the atoms of the angular-momentum- decomposed charge densities. Taking into account the arbi- trariness in the definition of nmm8 Is no particular significance should be attached to any of them sor other that could be introducedd and the usefulness and reliability of an approxi- mate DFT+U method sADFT+Ud, and of its more recent and involved evolutions such as the ADFT+DMFT method,should be judged from its ability to provide a correct physi- cal picture of the systems under study irrespective of the details of the formulation, once all ingredients entering the calculation are determined consistently.

2. To fully understand how the LDA+U approach operates, the first step is to identify the degrees of freedom that the Hubbard U will act upon and to define the corresponding occupation matrix nmm8 Is. While it is typically straightforward to pinpoint the atomic levels to be treated specially—such as the d electrons in transition metals and the f electrons in the rare earths and actinides series—in a multiatom system, there is no unique or rigorous way to define the occupation of localized atomic levels. Valid alternatives for nmm8 Is include sid projections onto normalized atomic orbitals, siid projections onto Wannier functions when relevant orbitals lead to isolated band manifolds, siiid Mulliken populations, or sivd integrated values in spherical regions around the atoms' angular-momentum-decomposed charge densities. Considering the arbitrariness in defining nmm8 Is, attaching any specific significance to these choices or any others that might be introduced is unnecessary. The utility and reliability of an approximate DFT+U method (ADFT+U) and its more recent, intricate advancements, such as the ADFT+DMFT method, should be assessed based on their capability to provide a physically accurate picture of the systems being studied, regardless of the specifics of the formulation, once all contributing factors are determined consistently.

2. 要完全理解LDA+U方法的工作原理，第一步是确定Hubbard U将作用的自由度并定义相应的占据矩阵nmm8 Is。虽然在特定系统中识别需要特殊处理的原子能级（如过渡金属中的d电子和稀土及锕系元素系列中的f电子）通常是直截了当的，但在多原子系统中，没有唯一或严格的方法来定义局部化原子能级的占据。对于nmm8 Is的有效替代选择包括sid对归一化原子轨道的投影，siid对当相关轨道导致孤立能带体系时的Wannier函数投影，siiidMulliken分布，或者sivd在原子的角动量分解后的电荷密度的球形区域内的积分值。考虑到nmm8 Is定义的任意性，不应给这些选择或其他可能引入的选择赋予任何特定意义。近似DFT+U方法（ADFT+U）及其近期更复杂的发展，如ADFT+DMFT方法的实用性和可靠性应基于它们提供研究系统正确物理图像的能力来评估，而不考虑形式的具体细节，一旦所有参与计算的要素被一致确定。

In order to simplify our analysis and gaining a more trans- parent physical interpretation of the 1U correction to stan- dard ADFT functionals we concentrate on the main effect associated to on-site Coulomb repulsion fthe F0 term in Eq. s4dg.

3. To simplify our analysis and gain a clearer physical understanding of the 1U correction to standard ADFT functionals, we focus on the primary effect related to on-site Coulomb repulsion—the F0 term in Equation (4). Consequently, we disregard the significant yet somewhat secondary effects linked to higher-multipolar terms in the Coulomb interaction (F2, F4, ...) and the appropriate treatment of magnetic interactions, which in the current rotational invariant method is handled through a renormalized spherical Hartree-Fock form (Equation (2) and Ref. 5).
