Linear response approach to the calculation of the effective interaction parameters in the LDA+U method.
In this work we reexamine the LDA+U method of Anisimov and co-workers in the framework of a plane-wave pseudopotential approach. A simplified rotational-invariant formulation is adopted. The calculation of the Hubbard U entering the expression of the functional is discussed and a linear response approach is proposed that is internally consistent with the chosen definition for the occupation matrix of the relevant localized orbitals. In this way we obtain a scheme whose functionality should not depend strongly on the particular implementation of the model in ab initio calculations.

The linear response approach enables the calculation of effective interaction parameters in the LDA+U method, ensuring internal consistency with the chosen definition for the occupation matrix of localized orbitals. This ensures the functionality of the method is not overly sensitive to the specific implementation in ab initio calculations.

In order to account explicitly for the on-site Coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insulators and not treated faithfully within LDA, Anisimov and co-workers13 correct the standard functional adding an on-site Hubbard-like interaction EHub: ELDA+Ufnsrdg = ELDAfnsrdg + EHubfhnm Isjg EDCfhnIsjg,s1d

Anisimov and colleagues incorporate an on-site Hubbard-like interaction into the functional to explicitly account for the on-site Coulomb interaction, which creates a correlation gap in Mott insulators and is not adequately handled within the Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA).

The formal expression of LDA+U energy functional is adapted from model Hamiltonians sthe Hubbard model in particulard that represent the natural theoretical framework to deal with strongly correlated materials. As in these mod- els, a small number of localized orbitals is selected and the electronic correlation associated to them is treated in a spe- cial way.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The LDA+U energy functional is derived from model Hamiltonians, specifically the Hubbard model, which naturally formulates the theoretical framework for handling strongly correlated materials. In these models, a limited number of localized orbitals are chosen, and their associated electronic correlations are treated uniquely.

In this work a critical reexamination of the LDA+U approach is proposed, which starts from the formulation of Anisimov and co-workers13 and its further improvements57 and develops a simpler approximation. This is, in our opin- ion, the minimal extension of the usual approximate DFT sLDA or GGAd schemes needed when atomiclike features are persistent in the solid environment.

This paper proposes a critical reevaluation of the LDA+U approach, beginning from the formulation by Anisimov and colleagues, and incorporating enhancements from further studies. This development aims for a simpler approximation, in our view, constituting the smallest extension needed to the typical approximate DFT schemes (like LDA or GGA) when atomic characteristics persist in the solid matrix.

In order to fully define how the approach works the first thing to do is to select the degrees of freedom on which Hubbard U will operate and define the corresponding occupation matrix nmm8 Is . Although it is usually straightforward to identify in a given system the atomic levels to be treated in a special way sthe d electrons in transition metals and the f ones in the rare earths and actinides seriesd there is no unique or rigorous way to define occupation of localized atomic levels in a multiatom system.

To fully understand the method, the first step is to choose the degrees of freedom that the Hubbard U will act upon and define the corresponding atomic level occupation matrix nmm8 Is . While it is typically easy to pinpoint the atomic levels needing special treatment in a system (such as d electrons in transition metals and f electrons in rare earths and actinides), there is no definitive or strict way to define the occupation of localized atomic levels in a system composed of multiple atoms.
