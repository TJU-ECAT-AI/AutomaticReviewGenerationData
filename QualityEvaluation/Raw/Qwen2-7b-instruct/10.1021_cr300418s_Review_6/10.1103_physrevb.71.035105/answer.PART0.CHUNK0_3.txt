<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The LDA+U method, introduced by Anisimov and colleagues, enhances the density functional theory by incorporating an on-site Coulomb interaction term to accurately describe the correlation gap in Mott insulators, which is not fully captured by the local spin-density approximation (LSDA).

<p>We have found that it is possible to solve this paradox by allowing the possibility that the system partially occupies, as within GGA, the eg levels, thus maintaining the driving force for the right rhombohedral deformation, and still opens a gap, as in standard LDA+U, by some orbital ordering that breaks the equivalence of the iron ions in the s111d plane.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We discovered that resolving this paradox involves permitting the system to partially occupy the eg levels, as it does in GGA, thereby preserving the force driving the correct rhombohedral deformation, and simultaneously creating a gap, akin to standard LDA+U, through a specific orbital ordering that disrupts the equivalence of iron ions in the s111d plane.

<p>From a simple tight-binding picture one finds that the optimal broken symmetry phase would be the one where occupied eg orbitals have the highest possible hopping term with unoccupied eg orbitals in nearest-neighbor atoms in the plane, in order to maximize the kinetic energy gain coming from delocalization, and the lowest possible hopping term with neighboring occupied eg orbitals, in order to minimize bandwidth that tends to destroy the insulating state.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
From a straightforward tight-binding perspective, the most favorable broken symmetry phase would feature the highest possible hopping between occupied eg orbitals and unoccupied eg orbitals of nearest-neighbor atoms within the plane, to maximize kinetic energy gains from delocalization, and the lowest possible hopping with nearby occupied eg orbitals to minimize bandwidth that risks disrupting the insulating state.

从简单的紧束缚观点来看，最理想的破对称相将是使占据的eg轨道与平面内相邻原子上未占据的eg轨道之间的跃迁系数达到最大，以最大化来自去局域化的动能增益，同时使与附近占据的eg轨道之间的最小跃迁系数，以最小化倾向于破坏绝缘状态的带宽。
