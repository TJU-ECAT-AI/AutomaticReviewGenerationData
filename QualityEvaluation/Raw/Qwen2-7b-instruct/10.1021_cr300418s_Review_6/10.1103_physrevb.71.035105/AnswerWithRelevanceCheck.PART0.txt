         <quote>1. The LDA+U method, introduced by Anisimov and colleagues, aims to explicitly account for the on-site Coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insulators by adding a Hubbard-like interaction term to the standard functional. This term, EHub, is defined as EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is), where EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j. The last term is subtracted to avoid double counting of interactions and uses the total, spin-projected, occupation of the localized manifold, nIs=∑m nm Is.</quote>
         <quote>2. To fully understand how the LDA+U approach operates, the first step is to identify the degrees of freedom that the Hubbard U will act upon and to define the corresponding occupation matrix nmm8 Is. While it is typically straightforward to pinpoint the atomic levels to be treated specially—such as the d electrons in transition metals and the f electrons in the rare earths and actinides series—in a multiatom system, there is no unique or rigorous way to define the occupation of localized atomic levels. Valid alternatives for nmm8 Is include sid projections onto normalized atomic orbitals, siid projections onto Wannier functions when relevant orbitals lead to isolated band manifolds, siiid Mulliken populations, or sivd integrated values in spherical regions around the atoms' angular-momentum-decomposed charge densities.</quote>
         <quote>3. The formal expression of the LDA+U energy functional is derived from model Hamiltonians, notably the Hubbard model, which naturally serves as the theoretical framework for handling strongly correlated materials.</quote>

         The LDA+U method, introduced by Anisimov and colleagues, aims to explicitly address the on-site Coulomb interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insulators by incorporating a Hubbard-like interaction term into the standard functional. This term, denoted as EHub, is formulated as EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is), where EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j. The final component is subtracted to prevent double counting of interactions and utilizes the total, spin-projected occupation of the localized manifold, nIs=∑m nm Is. To fully comprehend the LDA+U approach, the first step involves identifying the degrees of freedom that Hubbard U will influence and defining the corresponding occupation matrix nmm8 Is. Although it is generally simple to identify special atomic levels, such as d electrons in transition metals and f electrons in rare earths and actinides, in a multiatom system, there is no definitive or rigorous method for defining the occupation of localized atomic levels. Alternative valid choices for nmm8 Is include sid projections onto normalized atomic orbitals, siid projections onto Wannier functions when relevant orbitals form isolated band manifolds, siiid Mulliken populations, or sivd integrated values within spherical regions around atoms' angular-momentum-decomposed charge densities. The formal expression of the LDA+U energy functional is sourced from model Hamiltonians, notably the Hubbard model, which naturally acts as the theoretical framework for dealing with strongly correlated materials.

         安西莫夫和同事引入的LDA+U方法旨在通过向标准函数中添加Hubbard-like相互作用项来明确考虑Mott绝缘体中的局域电荷关联间隙，以应对局域电荷库仑相互作用。该术语表示为EHub = ∑Is EHub(hnm Is)，其中EHub(hnm Is) = 1/2 ∑Is ∑I ∑j g(hkm,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is ) + skm,m9uVeeum8,m-lnmm8 Is nm9m- Is j。最后的项被减去以避免重复计算相互作用，并使用局部化能级的总，自旋投影，占据数nIs=∑m nm Is。为了完全理解LDA+U方法的操作，首先需要确定Hubbard U将作用的自由度并定义相应的占据矩阵nmm8 Is。尽管在特定系统中识别需要特殊处理的原子能级（如过渡金属中的d电子和稀土及锕系元素系列中的f电子）通常是直截了当的，但在多原子系统中，没有唯一或严格的方法来定义局部化原子能级的占据。对于nmm8 Is的有效替代选择包括sid对归一化原子轨道的投影，siid对当相关轨道导致孤立能带体系时的Wannier函数投影，siiidMulliken分布，或者sivd在原子的角动量分解后的电荷密度的球形区域内的积分值。LDA+U能量功能的正式表达式来源于模型哈伯德模型，这自然成为处理强相关材料的理论框架。
