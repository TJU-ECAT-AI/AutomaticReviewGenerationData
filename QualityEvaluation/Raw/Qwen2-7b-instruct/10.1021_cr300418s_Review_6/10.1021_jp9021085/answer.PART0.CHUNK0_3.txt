Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the electronic structure, bonding, and reactivity of catalyst surfaces. These methods enable the prediction of surface properties, such as the formation of oxygen vacancies, the adsorption of molecules, and the electronic structure changes upon adsorption. Key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical framework, the efficiency of the computational algorithms, and the exploration of new catalytic materials through high-throughput screening. Challenges include the limitations of the exchange-correlation functionals, the computational cost for complex systems, and the need for validation against experimental data. Potential benefits include the reduction of the need for empirical trial-and-error experiments, the acceleration of the discovery of new catalysts, and the optimization of existing catalysts for specific applications.

The split vacancy structure on the (110) surface of ceria is more stable than the simple vacancy. CO adsorption on the (110) surface of ceria results in chemisorption on the Ce-bridge and O-bridge sites, with the CO molecule bridging two surface oxygen atoms. This leads to the formation of a CO3 species. NO2 adsorption on the reduced (110) surface of ceria can occur through two strong adsorption modes: one where one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site, and another where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. These findings highlight the importance of the electronic structure and the geometry of the adsorbed molecules in determining the reactivity of ceria surfaces.

The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO and NO2 adsorption does not have a major impact on the energy. For the oxygen vacancy, two different CeIII arrangements are observed with very similar energies. CO adsorption results in a particular configuration of CeIII, but tests show that changing this for the tilted O bridge adsorption mode only changes the adsorption energy by 0.04 eV. NO2 adsorption results in two adsorption modes, both of which show similar energies when the location of the CeIII was changed. However, in all cases, the location of the CeIII is strongly coupled to the local lattice distortion, most notably with the oxygen vacancy taking up the split vacancy structure when the CeIII is subsurface.

The energetics of catalytic processes at the (110) surface show that the steps involved are exothermic and balanced, indicating that the surface is likely to be highly active in both oxidation and reduction catalysis. However, it should be noted that the activation of NO2 is less than previously observed on other surfaces. These results provide a detailed investigation of the interactions involved in surface reduction and the adsorption of CO and NO2 on the (110) ceria surface.

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过提供催化剂表面的电子结构、键合和活性的信息，增强了我们预测、分析和理解烷烃活化中掺杂氧化物催化剂的能力。这些方法能够预测表面性质，如氧空位的形成、分子吸附以及吸附前后电子结构的变化。关键考虑因素包括理论框架的准确性、计算算法的效率以及通过高通量筛选探索新催化材料的可能性。挑战包括交换相关函数的局限性、复杂系统的计算成本以及与实验数据验证的需求。潜在的好处包括减少对经验试错实验的需求、加速新催化剂的发现以及现有催化剂针对特定应用的优化。

（110）表面的铈氧化物上的分裂空位结构比简单空位更稳定。铈氧化物（110）表面上的CO吸附导致在Ce桥和O桥两个位点上的化学吸附，CO分子桥接两个表面氧原子，将这些原子拉出晶格位置，形成CO3物种。这表明（110）表面在铈氧化物上具有高度的催化活性。

NO2与铈氧化物上（110）表面的相互作用可以分为两种强烈的吸附模式：一种是其中一个NO2氧原子占据空位位置，另一种是在铈行中相邻的铈原子上形成的双齿吸附模式，每个NO2氧原子都与相邻的铈原子配位。这些发现强调了电子结构和吸附分子几何形状在确定铈氧化物表面活性中的重要性。

在氧空位形成和CO、NO2吸附时，铈III位置对能量的影响不大。对于氧空位，观察到两种不同的铈III排列，它们的能量非常相似。CO吸附在铈氧化物（110）表面上导致特定的铈III排列，但测试显示，对于倾斜的O桥吸附模式，改变这一点仅使吸附能变化0.04 eV。NO2吸附在铈氧化物（110）表面上有两种吸附模式，当改变铈III的位置时，两者都显示出相似的能量。

催化过程在（110）表面的热力学性质表明，步骤是放热且平衡的，这表明表面在氧化和还原催化反应中可能是高度活跃的。然而，应当注意到NO2的活化低于在其他表面之前观察到的。这些结果为表面还原和CO、NO2在铈氧化物（110）表面吸附的相互作用提供了详细的研究。
