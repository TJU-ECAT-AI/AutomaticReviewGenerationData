Understanding the adsorption of environmentally sensitive molecules onto the surface of ceria is essential for its role in catalysis. By employing density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, GGA+U, researchers were able to explore the geometries and energetics of vacancy formation and the adsorption of CO and NO2 on the (110) surface of ceria. Vacancy formation revealed two distinct structures, with the previously observed simple vacancy less stable than the split vacancy, which involves an adjacent oxygen occupying a unique position. CO adsorption produced both chemisorbed and physisorbed species, while NO2 interaction led to two strong adsorption modes. The location of the CeIII sites during these processes did not significantly affect energy levels.

理解环境敏感分子在铈氧化物表面的吸附对于其催化作用至关重要。通过使用密度泛函理论并修正了局域电荷相互作用，GGA+U方法允许研究人员探索铈氧化物（110）表面氧空位形成和CO及NO2吸附的几何结构和能量特性。氧空位形成显示了两种不同的结构，其中之前观察到的简单空位比分裂空位更不稳定，后者涉及相邻氧原子占据其自身晶格位置和空位之间的位置。CO吸附产生了化学吸附和物理吸附物种，而NO2与还原（110）表面的相互作用导致了两种强烈的吸附模式。在这些过程中，CeIII位点的位置对能量水平的影响并不显著。
