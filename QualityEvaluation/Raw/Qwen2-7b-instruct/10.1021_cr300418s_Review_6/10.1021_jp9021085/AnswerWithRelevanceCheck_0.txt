Answers:

Relevant answers:

1. The application of GGA+U is required as it can consistently describe the properties of both the stoichiometric and the reduced surfaces, while standard DFT fails to model the reduced surface.

3. What are the specific interactions and adsorption modes of CO and NO2 on the (110) surface of ceria, and how do these interactions influence the catalytic activity?

Answers:

Relevant answers:

1. Vacancy formation on the (110) surface shows two different structures with the previously observed simple vacancy less stable than the split vacancy in which an adjacent oxygen takes up a position between its own lattice site and the vacancy.
2. The adsorption of CO on the surface of (110) produces both chemisorbed and physisorbed species.
3. The interaction of NO2 with the reduced (110) surface gives rise to two strong adsorption modes, the first in which one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site and the second where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row.
4. Several competing modes are observed for CO adsorption on the stoichiometric (110) surface, including a physisorbed state, two chemisorbed modes, and the formation of a CO3 species.
5. The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO and NO2 adsorption does not have a major impact on the energy.

English Version Answer:
Specific interactions and adsorption modes of CO and NO2 on the (110) surface of ceria are characterized by the formation of oxygen vacancies, the adsorption of CO leading to both chemisorbed and physisorbed species, and the interaction of NO2 resulting in two strong adsorption modes. CO adsorption can occur on two sites, the Ce-bridge and O-bridge, leading to the formation of a CO3 species. NO2 adsorption on the reduced (110) surface of ceria can take place through two strong adsorption modes, one involving one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupying the vacancy site and the other forming a bidentate mode with each NO2 oxygen atom coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO and NO2 adsorption does not significantly affect the energy, indicating that the system's energetics are robust against variations in the CeIII site positioning.

Chinese Version Answer:
CO和NO2在铈氧化物（110）表面的具体相互作用和吸附模式表现为氧空位的形成、CO的吸附产生化学吸附和物理吸附物种，以及NO2与还原（110）表面的相互作用导致两种强吸附模式。CO吸附可以在Ce桥和O桥两个位点上发生，形成CO3物种。NO2吸附在铈氧化物（110）表面的还原状态下可以通过两种强吸附模式发生，一种情况是一个NO2氧原子占据空位位置，另一种情况是每个NO2氧原子与相邻的Ce原子在Ce行中协调形成双齿吸附模式。氧空位形成以及CO和NO2吸附时CeIII位置的变化对系统的能量影响不大，表明系统的热力学特性对CeIII位置的变化不敏感。

Summary:

On the (110) surface of ceria, CO and NO2 exhibit specific interactions and adsorption modes. CO adsorption leads to both chemisorbed and physisorbed species, with the formation of a CO3 species in certain configurations. NO2 adsorption involves two strong modes, one where an NO2 oxygen atom occupies the vacancy site, and another where each NO2 oxygen atom coordinates to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO/NO2 adsorption does not significantly affect the energy, suggesting that the system's thermodynamics are robust against changes in the CeIII site positioning.
