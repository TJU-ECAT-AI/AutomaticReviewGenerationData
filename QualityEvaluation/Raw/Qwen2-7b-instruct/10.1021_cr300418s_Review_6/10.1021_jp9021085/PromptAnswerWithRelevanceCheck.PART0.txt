Understanding the adsorption of environmentally sensitive molecules onto the surface of ceria is essential for its role in catalysis. By employing density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, GGA+U, researchers were able to explore the geometries and energetics of vacancy formation and the adsorption of CO and NO2 on the (110) surface of ceria. Vacancy formation revealed two distinct structures, with the previously observed simple vacancy less stable than the split vacancy, which involves an adjacent oxygen occupying a unique position. CO adsorption produced both chemisorbed and physisorbed species, while NO2 interaction led to two strong adsorption modes. The location of the CeIII sites during these processes did not significantly affect energy levels.

<p>While standard GGA/LDA functionals can model stoichiometric ceria surfaces, they fail to correctly describe the localized CeIII states produced on the formation of surface oxygen vacancies (5-7) and observed experimentally using UPS. (19) This deficiency originates from the approximate exchange found in LDA/GGA density functional theory (DFT), which results in the self-interaction error (SIE). The GGA+U methodology (22) penalizes partial occupation of the atom-centered orbitals of interest and hence can be used to counter the artificial excess delocalization caused by the SIE, allowing a qualitatively correct description of the highly localized Ce f electronic states to be recovered. (5, 7)</p>
<p>Our calculations were performed using the VASP package, (29, 30) in which the valence electronic states are expanded within a plane-wave basis. The valence-core interaction is described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) approach, (31) and cores of [He] for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and [Xe] for cerium are used. The PBE GGA exchange-correlation functional (32) is applied with the Dudarev +U. (33)</p>
<p>For the reduction and molecular adsorption calculations, the oxygen vacancies and any adsorbed molecules (CO/NO2) are present on both sides of the slab so that no net dipole moment is created. To allow adsorption energies to be obtained, calculations of isolated molecules were performed in a cubic cell with sides of 10 Å. These reference calculations used the same exchange-correlation functional and plane wave cutoff, with k-space sampling only at the Γ-point.</p>
<p>The vacancy formation energy is defined as (2) where E(CeO2x) is the energy of the slab with an oxygen vacancy on each side, E(CeO2) is the energy of the stoichiometric CeO2 slab, and E(O2(g)) is the energy of gas-phase oxygen.</p>
<p>The CO adsorption energy per adsorbate molecule is given by (3) where E(CeO2 + 2CO(ads)) is the energy of the simulation cell containing the slab with a CO molecule adsorbed on each surface, E(CeO2) is the energy of the CeO2 slab before adsorption, and E(CO(g)) is the energy of a single CO molecule in the gas phase.</p>
<p>The NO2 adsorption energy per adsorbate molecule is given by (4) where E(CeO2x + 2NO2(ads)) is the energy of the simulation cell containing the reduced slab with a NO2 molecule adsorbed on each surface, E(CeO2x) is the energy of the reduced CeO2 slab before adsorption, and E(NO2(g)) is the energy of a single NO2 molecule in the gas phase.</p>
<p>Negative adsorption energies signify that the adsorption structure is stabilized as compared to the initially isolated species. Small adsorption energies, on the order of a few tenths of an eV, show a weak interaction between the molecule and the surface and are coupled to small perturbations to either molecular or surface structure. Large adsorption energies, on the order of 1 eV or greater, indicate a strong interaction between the molecule and the surface and are expected to be accompanied by strong perturbation to the structure of the molecule and the surface.</p>
<p>The atom projected electronic densities of states (EDOS) for both structures are similar (Figure 2), displaying an occupied gap state. Projection of the corresponding KohnSham orbitals onto atom-centered spherical harmonics shows this state is mainly composed of Ce 4f states. Integration of the defect peak gives two electrons per oxygen vacancy, and the spin density (defined as the difference between the up spin density and the down spin density) shows that two cerium atoms have been reduced (Figure 3) in agreement with previous studies. (5, 6) The simple vacancy, as previously reported, shows reduction of the surface atoms (Figure 3a). In contrast, the split vacancy shows reduction of one surface atom and one subsurface atom (Ce3; Figure 3b).</p>
<p>Several competing modes are observed for CO adsorption on the stoichiometric (110) surface. One of these is a physisorbed state, with an adsorption energy of 0.20 eV, similar to that previously observed. (16) Two chemisorbed modes are observed in which the CO is perpendicular to the surface. In both cases, the CO carbon approaches the surface between two surface O atoms, which are pulled slightly out of the surface layer. This gives a surface-bound species with the appearance of a CO3 group. Because the (110) surface only has Ce present in alternate rows, this perpendicular adsorption can occur with the carbon located above a cerium row (Ce-bridging) or located between oxygens where there is no Ce row (O-bridging). The perpendicular Ce-bridging mode (Figure 4a) is similar to the mode observed by Nolan et al., (16) which we calculated to have an adsorption energy of 1.78 eV. Adsorption at the O-bridge site is more stable, as previously noted by Fabris (17) and Yang, (15) with an adsorption energy of 3.48 eV. The greater stability is due to the C atom being able to approach the surface more closely in the absence of the surface Ce atoms, as compared to the Ce-bridging mode.</p>
<p>The interaction of NO2 with the reduced (110) surface gives rise to two strong adsorption modes, the first in which one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site and the second where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. For the vacancy adsorption mode, the CeOV bond length for one of the initial CeIII ions (Ce2) is considerably smaller than that for the other (Ce1), with the lengthening of the NOV bond. Curiously, the other CeO distances show the reverse behavior with Ce1O distances reduced while Ce2O are expanded. Analysis of the electronic structure and spin density distributions demonstrates that Ce1 has been reoxidized to CeIV, with the formation of adsorbed anionic NO2 species. The extended Ce1ON bond is therefore not correlated with the reduced Ce species but with the interaction of both of the NO2 oxygen atoms. The bidentate mode is symmetric with identical distances between the surface Ce atoms and the molecules O atoms. EDOS and spin density show a similar electron transfer to the molecules, but in this case the CeIII is not associated with the molecule and is found in an adjacent Ce row.</p>
<p>For the oxygen vacancy, two different CeIII arrangements are observed with very similar energies. CO adsorption results in a particular configuration of CeIII, but tests show that changing this for the tilted O bridge adsorption mode only changes the adsorption energy by 0.04 eV. NO2 adsorption results in two adsorption modes, both of which show similar energies when the location of the CeIII was changed. However, in all cases, the location of the CeIII is strongly coupled to the local lattice distortion, most notably with the oxygen vacancy taking up the split vacancy structure when the CeIII is subsurface.</p>
<p>The energetics of catalytic processes at this surface show that the steps involved are exothermic and balanced, indicating that the (110) is likely to be highly active in both oxidation and reduction catalysis. However, it should be noted that the activation of the NO2 is less than previously observed on other surfaces. (20) These results provide a detailed investigation of the interactions involved in surface reduction and the adsorption of CO and NO2 on the (110) ceria surface.</p>
<p>Understanding the adsorption of environmentally sensitive molecules onto the surface of ceria is vital for developing its role in catalysis. We present the geometries and energetics of vacancy formation and the adsorption of CO and NO2 onto the stoichiometric (CO) and reduced (NO2) (110) surface of ceria using density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, GGA+U. The application of GGA+U is required as it can consistently describe the properties of both the stoichiometric and the reduced surfaces, while standard DFT fails to model the reduced surface.</p>
<p>Vacancy formation on the (110) surface shows two different structures with the previously observed simple vacancy less stable than the split vacancy in which an adjacent oxygen takes up a position between its own lattice site and the vacancy. Examination of the electronic structure illustrates that the different vacancy geometries result in different Ce atoms being reduced. The simply vacancy reduces two ceria atoms adjacent to the vacancy, while the split vacancy results in reduction of one surface and one subsurface Ce (both of which are adjacent to the original vacancy).</p>
<p>The adsorption of CO on the surface of (110) produces both chemisorbed and physisorbed species. Chemisorption on two sites, the Ce-bridge and O-bridge, results in the CO molecule bridging two surface oxygen atoms and pulling these atoms out of their lattice sites, with the formation of a CO3 species. Tilting of the CO3 group results in stabilization of these modes, with the O-bridge site occurring with greater stability. The strong adsorption is accompanied by the formation of a surface carbonate species, which is confirmed through analysis of the electronic structure and is consistent with the experiment. (11) Analysis of the electronic structure for the (110) surface also shows the formation of the Ce 4f derived gap state between the valence band and the unoccupied Ce 4f states, which is a characteristic signature of reduced ceria. Reduction of two cerium atoms close to the adsorption site is confirmed by analysis of the spin density, indicating that the strong chemisorption of CO on a stoichiometric ceria surface results in the molecule being oxidized and the ceria surface being reduced.</p>
<p>The interaction of NO2 with the reduced (110) surface gives rise to two strong adsorption modes, the first in which one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site and the second where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row.

These methods enable the prediction of surface properties, such as the formation of oxygen vacancies, the adsorption of molecules, and the electronic structure changes upon adsorption. Key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical framework, the efficiency of the computational algorithms, and the exploration of new catalytic materials through high-throughput screening. Challenges include the limitations of the exchange-correlation functionals, the computational cost for complex systems, and the need for validation against experimental data. Potential benefits include the reduction of the need for empirical trial-and-error experiments, the acceleration of the discovery of new catalysts, and the optimization of existing catalysts for specific applications.

The split vacancy structure on the (110) surface of ceria is more stable than the simple vacancy. CO adsorption on the (110) surface of ceria results in chemisorption on the Ce-bridge and O-bridge sites, with the CO molecule bridging two surface oxygen atoms. This leads to the formation of a CO3 species. NO2 adsorption on the reduced (110) surface of ceria can occur through two strong adsorption modes: one where one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site, and another where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. These findings highlight the importance of the electronic structure and the geometry of the adsorbed molecules in determining the reactivity of ceria surfaces.

The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO and NO2 adsorption does not have a major impact on the energy. For the oxygen vacancy, two different CeIII arrangements are observed with very similar energies.

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过提供催化剂表面的电子结构、键合和活性的信息，增强了我们预测、分析和理解烷烃活化中掺杂氧化物催化剂的能力。这些方法能够预测表面性质，如氧空位的形成、分子吸附以及吸附前后电子结构的变化。关键考虑因素包括理论框架的准确性、计算算法的效率以及通过高通量筛选探索新催化材料的可能性。挑战包括交换相关函数的局限性、复杂系统的计算成本以及与实验数据验证的需求。潜在的好处包括减少对经验试错实验的需求、加速新催化剂的发现以及现有催化剂针对特定应用的优化。

（110）表面的铈氧化物上的分裂空位结构比简单空位更稳定。铈氧化物（110）表面上的CO吸附导致在Ce桥和O桥两个位点上的化学吸附，CO分子桥接两个表面氧原子，将这些原子拉出晶格位置，形成CO3物种。这表明（110）表面在铈氧化物上具有高度的催化活性。

NO2与铈氧化物上（110）表面的相互作用可以分为两种强烈的吸附模式：一种是其中一个NO2氧原子占据空位位置，另一种是在铈行中相邻的铈原子上形成的双齿吸附模式，每个NO2氧原子都与相邻的铈原子配位。这些发现强调了电子结构和吸附分子几何形状在确定铈氧化物表面活性中的重要性。

在氧空位形成和CO、NO2吸附时，铈III位置对能量的影响不大。对于氧空位，观察到两种不同的铈III排列，它们的能量非常相似。CO吸附在铈氧化物（110）表面上导致特定的铈III排列，但测试显示，对于倾斜的O桥吸附模式，改变这一点仅使吸附能变化0.04 eV。NO2吸附在铈氧化物（110）表面上有两种吸附模式，当改变铈III的位置时，两者都显示出相似的能量。

催化过程在（110）表面的热力学性质表明，步骤是放热且平衡的，这表明表面在氧化和还原催化反应中可能是高度活跃的。然而，应当注意到NO2的活化低于在其他表面之前观察到的。这些结果为表面还原和CO、NO2在铈氧化物（110）表面吸附的相互作用提供了详细的研究。

1. Computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing a means to simulate the electronic structure and chemical bonding at the surface of the catalyst. This allows for a detailed investigation of the interactions involved in surface reduction and adsorption of molecules. Key considerations include the accuracy of the computational methods in predicting bond lengths, energies, and electronic states, as well as the efficiency of the calculations in terms of computational resources and time. Potential benefits include the exploration of new catalytic materials and the optimization of existing ones without the need for extensive experimental testing.

2. Challenges in using computational methods for studying doped oxide catalysts include the limitations of current theoretical frameworks in accurately describing complex electronic interactions, especially at the surface of the catalyst. Another challenge is the computational cost, which can limit the size of the systems that can be modeled and the level of detail that can be achieved. Additionally, the interpretation of results requires a deep understanding of both the chemistry of the system and the computational methods used.

3. The accuracy of computational predictions is crucial for understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts. The use of methods like GGA+U can improve the accuracy by accounting for the localized electronic states that arise during surface reduction. Efficiency is also important, as computational simulations can provide insights into a wide range of materials and conditions that might be difficult or impossible to test experimentally.

4. The interaction of NO2 with the reduced (110) surface of ceria leads to two strong adsorption modes. In one mode, one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site, while in the other, a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. This interaction results in the reoxidation of one of the CeIII ions to CeIV and a partial reduction of the adsorbed NO2 molecule to NO2.

5. The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO and NO2 adsorption does not significantly affect the energy of the system. Two different CeIII arrangements are observed for oxygen vacancy formation with very similar energies. This suggests that the energetics of the system are robust against variations in the location of the CeIII sites.

2. 使用计算方法研究掺杂氧化物催化剂的挑战包括当前理论框架在准确描述复杂电子相互作用时的局限性，特别是催化剂表面的情况。另一个挑战是计算成本，这可能限制了可以模拟的系统大小和实现的细节水平。此外，结果的解释需要深入了解系统化学和使用的计算方法。

3. 计算预测的准确性对于理解掺杂氧化物催化剂的催化活性至关重要。使用GGA+U等方法可以提高准确性，通过考虑表面还原期间出现的局部电子状态。效率也很重要，因为计算模拟可以提供实验难以或不可能测试的一系列材料和条件的见解。

4. NO2与掺杂的（110）表面的铈亚表面的相互作用导致两种强吸附模式。在一种模式中，一个NO2氧原子占据空位位置；在另一种模式中，形成一个双齿吸附模式，每个NO2氧原子都与相邻的Ce原子在Ce行中协调。这种相互作用导致一个CeIII离子从CeIV还原，并将吸附的NO2分子部分还原为NO2。

5. 氧空位形成以及CO和NO2吸附时CeIII位置的变化对系统的能量影响不大。观察到两种不同的CeIII排列方式，具有非常相似的能量。这表明系统的热力学特性对CeIII位置变化不敏感。
