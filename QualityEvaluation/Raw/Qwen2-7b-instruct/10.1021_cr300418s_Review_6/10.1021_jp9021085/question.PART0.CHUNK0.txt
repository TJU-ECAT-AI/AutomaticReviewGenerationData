Scanlon*Natasha M. GaleaBenjamin J. MorganGraeme W. Watson* View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract The geometries and electronic structures resulting from surface reduction, CO adsorption, and NO2 adsorption at the (110) surface of CeO2 have been calculated using density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, GGA+U. We report a novel electronic structure for the reduced surface, denoted the split vacancy, which is more stable than the previously reported simple vacancy with subsurface CeIII. Analysis of CO adsorption modes highlights the importance of the geometry of the CO molecule when in contact with the surface, with a tilted adsorption mode being most energetically favorable with the formation of a carbonate anion coupled with surface reduction. A new bidentate adsorption mode is observed for NO2 adsorption, accompanied by partial surface oxidation. These novel structures observed on reduction, CO adsorption, and NO2 adsorption are all energetically more stable than the previously reported structures. In all of the systems, it was found that the location of the CeIII ions did not have a strong effect on the energetics, although they were coupled to strong local distortions of the structure.

This stems from an ability to store and release oxygen, described as the oxygen storage capacity (OSC). Ceria can additionally take part in the catalytic oxidation of CO and reduction of NO2 without the need for precious metals. (4) Oxidation of CO to CO2 produces oxygen vacancies at the ceria surface, with pairs of CeIV atoms neighboring the vacancies reduced to CeIII. Using KrogerVink notation, this is represented as (1) It has been demonstrated that density functional theory (LDA/GGA-DFT) is unsuitable for the study of reduced ceria. (5-7) These methods predict that the excess electrons produced on reduction are delocalized over all of the Ce atoms in the calculation. GGA+U or hybrid DFT approaches correct for this artificial delocalization (7-9) and predict reduction of two Ce atoms adjacent to the O vacancy. The (110) surface is predicted to undergo reduction most easily. For this surface, previous calculations have predicted the reduced Ce atoms to be located in the surface layer and directly coordinated to the removed oxygen. (5, 7, 8) An alternative reduction process has been indicated by preliminary results from quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations at the HartreeFock level, (10) with the nearest neighbor subsurface Ce site preferentially reduced.
Once formed, surface oxygen vacancies act as reactive sites for molecular reduction. The initial step in the catalyzed reduction of NO2 to N2 involves the reduction of NO2 to NO, with the liberated oxygen reoxidizing the surface. Given the importance of the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria, it is imperitive to have a comprehensive understanding of this material and the interaction of pure and reduced surfaces with environmentally sensitive molecules.
Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been undertaken on the redox behavior and catalytic properties of CeO2, with many indicating differences in reactivity depending on the choice of surface exposed. Li et al. (11) reported experimentally observed infrared vibrational modes that indicated that CO adsorption results in the formation of carbonate species. A second weak adsorption mode was attributed to physisorption because desorption above room temperature proved extremely facile. In these studies, the ceria sample was powdered, and thus no conclusions regarding surface sensitivity could be established. Surface sensitivity has been demonstrated in studies of the interaction of CO with nanorods and nanoparticles (12) and polycrystalline ceria. (13) The oxidation of CO on the (110) and (100) surfaces of ceria nanorods is more efficient than that on nanoparticles that primarily expose the (111) surface. Aging and heating of ceria polycrystallites increase the CO oxidation activity, and this has been linked to an increase in the area of the exposed (100) surface. (13) Sayle et al. (14) have used interatomic potentials to compare the energy change upon oxidation of CO with that of oxygen extraction from bulk ceria and from the (111) and (110) surfaces. The reaction was predicted to be most exothermic on the (110) surface. Yang et al. used LDA to study CO adsorption on the (111) and (110) surfaces of ceria. (15) They found strong surface sensitivity, with weak physisorption on the (111) surface, and weak and strong adsorption modes on the (110) surface. In all cases, the strong adsorption modes involved the formation of a carbonate-like structure on the surface. Ceria surfaces are known experimentally to be reduced, and standard DFT functionals (LDA/GGA) are unsuitable for the study of reduced ceria. (5-7) Nolan et al. (16) used GGA+U and the PW91 functional to study CO adsorption on the (111), (110), and (100) surfaces of ceria, and they predicted the strongest adsorption for the (100) surface, which was associated with surface reduction. A recent study by Huang and Fabris (17) examined CO adsorption on the (111) and (110) surfaces using GGA+U and the PBE functional. They found an adsorption energy and geometry for the (110) surface similar to that previously observed (16) and additionally observed an alternative more favorable adsorption site.
Recent experimental studies on the ceriaNO2 interaction include those of Rodriguez et al., who studied NO2 adsorption on the (111) ceria surface, (4) and Berner et al., who studied the interaction of NO2 with the (111) surface of ceria on a Pt support. (2) Namai et al. used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the interaction of NO2 with a slightly reduced CeO2 (111) surface. (18) Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) (19) and AFM (18) indicate that NO2 does not react with stoichiometric ceria. If the surface is prereduced, however, NO2 is found to dissociate into NO, accompanied by a reduction in the intensity of the CeIII peak in the UPS spectrum. (19) Observations using AFM indicate that this process is coupled to the healing of oxygen vacancies on the surface. The only calculations on NO2 adsorption to date are those of Nolan et al., (20) using GGA+U and the PW91 functional, which predicted strong chemisorption on all of the reduced surfaces of ceria and an elongation of the NO bond for the oxygen bound into the vacant site.
In this article, we present a study of the (110) surface including oxygen vacancy formation, CO adsorption on the stoichiometric surface, and NO2 adsorption on the reduced surface. The (110) surface of ceria is known to be active for surface reactions and shows good stability as compared to the (100) surface due to it being a type I surface, (21) making it a good model surface for providing general insight into ceria catalysis.
Theoretical Methods While standard GGA/LDA functionals can model stoichiometric ceria surfaces, they fail to correctly describe the localized CeIII states produced on the formation of surface oxygen vacancies (5-7) and observed experimentally using UPS. (19) This deficiency originates from the approximate exchange found in LDA/GGA density functional theory (DFT), which results in the self-interaction error (SIE). The GGA+U methodology (22) penalizes partial occupation of the atom-centered orbitals of interest and hence can be used to counter the artificial excess delocalization caused by the SIE, allowing a qualitatively correct description of the highly localized Ce f electronic states to be recovered. (5, 7) The validity of the GGA+U approach has been demonstrated in its recent use in providing improved descriptions of a wide range of localized electronic defect systems including reduced cations (23-26) and oxygen holes. (27, 28) Our calculations were performed using the VASP package, (29, 30) in which the valence electronic states are expanded within a plane-wave basis. The valencecore interaction is described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) approach, (31) and cores of [He] for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and [Xe] for cerium are used. The PBE GGA exchange-correlation functional (32) is applied with the Dudarev +U. (33) The sensitivity of results to the value of U for GGA+U calculations of ceria has previously been described; (7) a value of U = 5 eV was selected for the Ce f orbitals.
Within 3D periodic boundary conditions, a surface is represented by a 2D slab separated from its periodic images in the direction perpendicular to the surface by a vacuum gap: in this work, a vacuum gap of 15 Å was used. For the (110) surface, an 11.5 Å (7 atomic layers) slab with a p(2 × 2) expansion of the surface unit cell was constructed. This gives a minimum distance of 7.76 Å between periodic images of the adsorbate molecules, in the (110) direction, which reduces the defectdefect interaction between simulation cells. The cutoff energy for the plane wave basis is 500 eV, and the Brillouin zone was sampled using a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst Pack grid, with the third vector perpendicular to the surface plane. All calculations were spin polarized with the spin degrees of freedom allowed to relax. Relaxation of the atomic structure was carried out for all atoms until the forces were below 0.005 eV Å1, which was found to be necessary to obtain converged molecular adsorption structures.
For the reduction and molecular adsorption calculations, the oxygen vacancies and any adsorbed molecules (CO/NO2) are present on both sides of the slab so that no net dipole moment is created. To allow adsorption energies to be obtained, calculations of isolated molecules were performed in a cubic cell with sides of 10 Å. These reference calculations used the same exchange-correlation functional and plane wave cutoff, with k-space sampling only at the Γ-point. Full geometry relaxation of all surfaceadsorbate structures was carried out, and all calculations were spin polarized with the spin degrees of freedom allowed to relax.
The vacancy formation energy is defined as (2) where E(CeO2x) is the energy of the slab with an oxygen vacancy on each side, E(CeO2) is the energy of the stoichiometric CeO2 slab, and E(O2(g)) is the energy of gas-phase oxygen. It is well know that DFT overstabilizes the binding energy of oxygen. (34) The error for the PBE functional has been calculated to be 0.7 eV per O atom, although the energetics reported here have not been corrected for this error.
The CO adsorption energy per adsorbate molecule is given by (3) where E(CeO2 + 2CO(ads)) is the energy of the simulation cell containing the slab with a CO molecule adsorbed on each surface, E(CeO2) is the energy of the CeO2 slab before adsorption, and E(CO(g)) is the energy of a single CO molecule in the gas phase.
The NO2 adsorption energy per adsorbate molecule is given by (4) where E(CeO2x + 2NO2(ads)) is the energy of the simulation cell containing the reduced slab with a NO2 molecule adsorbed on each surface, E(CeO2x) is the energy of the reduced CeO2 slab before adsorption, and E(NO2(g)) is the energy of a single NO2 molecule in the gas phase.
Negative adsorption energies signify that the adsorption structure is stabilized as compared to the initially isolated species. Small adsorption energies, on the order of a few tenths of an eV, show a weak interaction between the molecule and the surface and are coupled to small perturbations to either molecular or surface structure. Large adsorption energies, on the order of 1 eV or greater, indicate a strong interaction between the molecule and the surface and are expected to be accompanied by strong perturbation to the structure of the molecule and the surface.
Vacancy Formation at the (110) Surface of Ceria The (110) surface exposes rows of oxygen atoms in the (001) direction separated by alternate rows of Ce atoms (Figure 1a). All of the oxygen sites are geometrically equivalent on the stoichiometric surface. On removal of an oxygen, Ov in Figure 1a, the system relaxes to one of two competing minima. The first of these, denoted the simple vacancy (Figure 1b), consists of a significant distortion around the three Ce atoms originally coordinated to the oxygen that was removed, one of which is in the subsurface layer. The two Ce atoms in the surface layer (Ce1 and Ce2) are equivalent, with surface CeO distances of 2.33 Å (O1), 2.27 Å (O2), and 2.36 Å (O3), as compared to 2.34 Å in the stoichiometric surface. The subsurface Ce3 moves away from the vacancy, slightly reducing the Ce3O distances as compared to those in the pure surface (Table 1).

The alternative conformation, denoted the split vacancy (Figure 1c), forms when the oxygen in the adjacent row (O1), which is also coordinated to Ce1 and Ce2, moves out of the surface to a position almost equidistant between the vacancy site and its original lattice site. The O1 atom bridges Ce1 and Ce2, with the Ce3O1 distance increased. The CeO distances are not symmetric (Table 1), displaying a particularly short Ce2O1 distance and an average CeO distance much shorter around Ce2 (average of 2.17 Å) than Ce1 (average of 2.34 Å). The Ce3O distances for the split vacancy show an increase to the nearest oxygen atoms (average of 2.43 Å; Table 1).
The distorted structure for the split vacancy has a formation energy of +1.61 eV, which is more stable than the simple vacancy structure previously observed (5) that has a formation energy of +1.93 eV. It should be noted that the energy demonstrated here for the simple vacancy is considerably less favorable than the split vacancy, and while it is similar to Nolan et al., (5) it is considerably higher than the energy of 1.57 eV reported by Fabris et al. for the simple vacancy (8) which is similar to our split vacancy energy.
The atom projected electronic densities of states (EDOS) for both structures are similar (Figure 2), displaying an occupied gap state. Projection of the corresponding KohnSham orbitals onto atom-centered spherical harmonics shows this state is mainly composed of Ce 4f states. Integration of the defect peak gives two electrons per oxygen vacancy, and the spin density (defined as the difference between the up spin density and the down spin density) shows that two cerium atoms have been reduced (Figure 3) in agreement with previous studies. (5, 6) The simple vacancy, as previously reported, shows reduction of the surface atoms (Figure 3a). In contrast, the split vacancy shows reduction of one surface atom and one subsurface atom (Ce3; Figure 3b). The reduction of a single surface atom is the reason for the asymmetry in the surface structure, with the reduced CeIII atoms associated with longer local CeO bonds. The gap state for the split vacancy is broader than for the simple vacancy due to the two different reduction sites.

Adsorption of CO on the Stoichiometric (110) Surface of CeO2 Several competing modes are observed for CO adsorption on the stoichiometric (110) surface. One of these is a physisorbed state, with an adsorption energy of 0.20 eV, similar to that previously observed. (16) The C is directly above a Ce atom with a CeC distance of 2.30 Å, while the CO distance is unchanged at 1.14 Å. There is no significant change in the electronic structure, and no further analysis of this adsorption mode is presented.
Two chemisorbed modes are observed in which the CO is perpendicular to the surface. In both cases, the CO carbon approaches the surface between two surface O atoms, which are pulled slightly out of the surface layer. This gives a surface-bound species with the appearance of a CO3 group. Because the (110) surface only has Ce present in alternate rows, this perpendicular adsorption can occur with the carbon located above a cerium row (Ce-bridging) or located between oxygens where there is no Ce row (O-bridging). The perpendicular Ce-bridging mode (Figure 4a) is similar to the mode observed by Nolan et al., (16) which we calculated to have an adsorption energy of 1.78 eV. Adsorption at the O-bridge site is more stable, as previously noted by Fabris (17) and Yang, (15) with an adsorption energy of 3.48 eV. The greater stability is due to the C atom being able to approach the surface more closely in the absence of the surface Ce atoms, as compared to the Ce-bridging mode. This allows the CO3 to form with the lattice oxygen atoms moving significantly less from their lattice sites (Figure 4b).
Figure 4 Figure 4. The adsorption geometry for CO on the (110) surface of ceria. (a) Vertical CO on the Ce bridge site, (b) vertical CO on the O bridge site, (c) tilted CO on the Ce bridge site, and (d) tilted CO on the O bridge site. Oxygen atoms are red, cerium atoms are gray, carbon is purple, and the oxygen atoms of the CO3 group are in blue.
Both of these previously identified adsorption modes have the original CO bond oriented perpendicular to the surface. Fabris et al. found that on tilting the molecule the energy increases slowly, indicating the molecule was in a shallow minimum. (17) In our calculations, full relaxation from an initially tilted CO structure with a small convergence criteria of 0.005 eV Å1 results in more stable tilted CO3 groups for both adsorption sites, as shown in Figure 4c and d. The calculated adsorption energies are 2.37 and 3.54 eV for the Ce- and O-bridging modes, respectively.
The most stable O-bridge tilted structure has a distorted CO3 moiety in which there is one short CO distance of 1.26 Å, derived from the interacting CO molecule, and two long CO distances of 1.31 and 1.34 Å. The two O atoms from the surface are drawn out from their original lattice sites by different amounts. This breaks the symmetry observed for the perpendicular adsorption mode, for which the CO distances are 1.23 and 2 × 1.35 Å. The observed CO distances are more consistent with those of carbonate (CO32, 1.28 Å) (35) than other molecular CO bonds (CO, 1.14 Å; CO2, 1.20 Å). The structure of the CO3 group is similar in all of the adsorption modes (see Table 2). The displacement of the oxygen atoms out of the surface is greater for the Ce-bridging mode as the oxygen move toward the Ce atoms they interact with, leading to less favorable adsorption energies. The tilted modes result in interaction of the terminal oxygen and the surface cerium atoms. For the Ce bridge, the oxygen can interact directly with the Ce in the Ce row in which the CO adsorbs, giving rise to one CeO distance of 2.50 Å. For the O bridge, tilting of the molecule would result in the terminal oxygen being equidistant from the Ce atoms in adjacent Ce rows. It is this interaction that causes the breaking of the symmetry as the terminal oxygen relaxes toward one of the Ce sites, resulting in CeO distances of 2.79 and 3.79 Å (Table 2).

Figure 5 shows the atom projected total EDOS for CO adsorbed on the (110) surface. The other adsorption modes give the same features. The EDOS shows a gap state due to CeIII between the top of the valence band and the empty conduction band, as seen for the reduced surface, indicating that the surface has been reduced by the interaction of the CO molecule.

Oxygen states are red, cerium states are green, and carbon states are blue. The top of the valence band is aligned to 0 eV with the vertical dashed line showing the position of the highest occupied state.
The excess spin density is shown in Figure 6 for all of the CO adsorption modes. In all cases, an excess spin of four electrons are localized on two surface Ce ions on each side of the slab. The reduced CeIII are coordinated to the terminal oxygen of the CO3 group when the molecule is tilted at the O-bridge (Figure 6d). For the other adsorption modes, a similar reduction of the surface is observed with various geometric arrangements of the reduced CeIII. For the perpendicular O-bridge (Figure 6b), the CeIII are diagonally arranged in the square of four adjacent Ce sites. For the perpendicular Ce-bridge (Figure 6a), the reduced Ce atoms are those adjacent to the molecule, and for the tilted Ce-bridge (Figure 6c), the Ce coordinated to the terminal O of the CO3 group is reduced, along with a Ce atom in the next Ce row.

(a) Vertical CO on the Ce bridge site, (b) vertical CO on the O bridge site, (c) tilted CO on the Ce bridge site, and (d) tilted CO on the O bridge site. Oxygen atom are red, cerium atoms are gray, carbon is purple, the oxygen atoms of the CO3 group are blue, and the spin isosurface at 0.05 e Å3 is green.
To check if the location of the CeIII is significant, we repeated the calculations for the tilted O-bridge CO adsorption mode localizing the spin density on the two Ce atoms away from the terminal O of the CO. The relaxed structure is similar to that found with the reduced Ce coordinated to the terminal O with CO bond lengths of 1.27, 1.31, and 1.34 Å. Analysis of the electronic structure shows an EDOS similar to that presented in Figure 5 and an adsorption energy of 3.50 eV. This is only 0.04 eV less stable than localizing the CeIII close to the terminal oxygen, showing that the exact position of the CeIII does not have a significant impact on the structure, energy, or electronic structure.
The geometry of the adsorbed species is consistent with the structure of a carbonate ion, CO32. Figure 7 shows the C and O 2p atomic decomposed EDOS for the CO3 group on the surface and from neutral gas-phase CO3(g). The spin pairing is characteristic of a closed shell system, and the nature of the peaks is very similar. The highest occupied state in the adsorbate is consistent with the lowest unoccupied state of the gas-phase CO3(g) with both primarily derived from O 2p states. The two 4-electron states below this in the gas-phase molecule correspond to the broad 8-electron peak in the adsorbed system with the 6-electron peak at 4.5 eV splitting into three 2-electron peaks between 5.5 and 6.5 eV when adsorbed. The lowest energy peak at 6 eV in the gas phase corresponds to the peak at 8 eV in the adsorbed system. Summation of the Bader charges (36) associated with the atoms shows that 1.90 electrons (for the tilted O-bridge) have been transferred to the adsorbed species, providing further evidence for the adsorption structure of CO on the (110) ceria surface being the carbonate anion, CO32.

Formation of a carbonate group on the (110) surface is consistent with previous experimental data. (11-13) Li also found a configuration in which the carbon atom of CO points at the surface and the CO molecule remains intact (11) similar to the weak adsorption mode found. Recent experimental data on polycrystalline ceria, nanoparticles and nanorods, which expose different crystallographic faces, are also consistent with the present results. (12, 13) Adsorption of NO2 on Reduced Ceria Surfaces The relaxed geometries of two different adsorption modes for the NO2(110) ceria surface are shown in Figure 8. Adsorption and dissociation of NO2 to NO will not occur on the stoichiometric surface of ceria (110), requiring surface prereduction to produce reactive O vacancy sites. The two Ce atoms either side of the vacancy that are reduced to CeIII in the simple-vacancy reduction are indicated by the green (Ce1) and yellow (Ce2) spheres.
Figure 8 Figure 8. NO2 adsorption modes at a O vacancy site on the (110) CeO2 surface. (a) The vacancy absorption mode, and (b) the bidentate adsorption mode. Red spheres are oxygen, gray are cerium, and blue is nitrogen. The green and yellow spheres indicate the Ce sites previously reduced to CeIII during formation of the O vacancy.
In the vacancy adsorption mode (Figure 8a), the NO2 molecule adsorbs onto the surface through one of its oxygen atoms, which occupies the pre-existing vacancy site. We denote this oxygen atom as OV and the other oxygen atom of NO2 as ON. The molecule displays a bent configuration with the remaining NON bond oriented toward Ce1. In the bidentate adsorption mode (Figure 8b), the NO2 molecule is coordinated to the two ceria atoms around the vacancy through both of the NO2 oxygen atoms. The NO2 is bent, allowing the two oxygen atoms to each coordinate to one Ce atom. Neither of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site.
The adsorption is strongly exothermic with an adsorption energy of 1.83 eV for the vacancy adsorption site and 1.94 eV for the previously unknown bidentate adsorption mode, indicating a strong interaction between the molecule and the reduced oxide surface. As compared to previous work, (20) the vacancy adsorption mode is less energetically favorable. This difference is due to the large p(2 × 2) expansion used in this work. The formation of the oxygen vacancy is more favorable on the p(2 × 2) than on the p(2 × 1) (see section 3), and hence the healing of the vacancy by NO2 is artificially favored in previous work (20) due to the smaller surface cell.
The vacancy adsorption mode involves elongation of the NOV bond from the gas-phase value of 1.21 to 1.31 Å, with the NON distance extending slightly to 1.25 Å. The bidentate mode results in NO bonds of 1.27 Å. Although there is significant lengthening of the NO bonds, dissociation to NO and oxygen is not observed, indicating an energy barrier to the breaking of this bond. Experimental data suggest a temperature of around 300 K is needed before NO2 will dissociate over reduced ceria. (4) In analyzing changes in the surface atomic structure upon adsorption of NO2, we focus on the local geometry around the surface Ce ions around the vacancy, Ce1 and Ce2. For the vacancy adsorption mode, OV is found to be closer to Ce2 than Ce1, with CeOV distances of 2.87 Å (Ce1) and 2.60 Å (Ce2). These are considerably larger than that found in the stoichiometric surface (2.34 Å), resulting in the molecule being above the surface plane (Figure 8a). On the surface, the Ce1bridging-oxygen (O1) distance is 2.23 Å, while the Ce2bridging-oxygen distance is 2.44 Å. The remaining surface CeO distances are 2.20/2.22 Å (Ce1) and 2.36/2.37 Å (Ce2), indicating substantially shorter surface CeO distances involving Ce1, as compared to Ce2, contrary to the CeOV distances. For the bidentate mode, the CeNO2 distances are approximately symmetric at 2.48 and 2.49 Å, as are the distances between the Ce atom and bridging O (2.26 and 2.27 Å).
The atom projected total and NO2 EDOS for the NO2(110)CeO2 surfaceadsorbate structure is shown in Figure 9 (the vacancy mode is shown, but both modes despite their different structures produce similar EDOS). The total EDOS, Figure 9a, is typical for reduced ceria, with a narrow peak between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the unoccupied Ce 4f states that make up the conduction band, confirming that CeIII ions remain present upon adsorption of NO2. Integration of the CeIII peak gives a single electron per surface, indicating that the surface has been partially oxidized. The excess spin density is plotted for both structures in Figure 10. Figure 10a shows that for the vacancy mode a single reduced CeIII ion (Ce1) remains on the surface, while Ce2 has been reoxidized to CeIV with no spin density associated with NO2. For the bidentate adsorption mode, the spin density (Figure 10b) shows that neither of the initially reduced Ce atoms are still CeIII. In fact, a Ce atom in the other Ce row of the p(2 × 2) cell has been reduced. Again, no spin density is observed on the NO2.

Molecular NO2 has an unpaired electron and would be expected to contribute to the spin density. The lack of spin density on the NO2 suggests it has received an electron, forming NO2. Calculated Bader charges show that the total charge on NO2 increases by 0.80 electrons on adsorption. The observed lengthening of the NO bonds upon adsorption further supports the presence of an anionic NO species. Symmetric elongation of the NO bond distances from 1.21 to 1.26 Å is seen in gas-phase NO2, with the asymmetric bond elongation found in the vacancy adsorption mode due to the asymmetric electric field present at the surface as well as activation of the molecule toward NO bond cleavage. The atom projected EDOS for the N and O of the adsorbate, gas-phase NO2, and gas-phase NO2 are shown in Figure 9bd, respectively. Gas-phase NO2 (Figure 9c) has an open shell character, as expected, while spin pairing is observed for the adsorbed species (Figure 9b). A similar spin pairing and composition of the states is present for the NO anion (Figure 9d), confirming that the adsorbed NO2 has received an electron from the surface, making the adsorbed species NO.
For the vacancy adsorption mode, the analysis of the adsorption site is different from previous work on NO2 adsorption, (20) which indicated that the asymmetric adsorption was a result of the CeIIIOV distance being elongated as compared to the reoxidized CeIVOV distance. Here, however, the reduced Ce1 shows a short distance to the molecule, while the reoxidized Ce2 shows a longer distance to OV. By modifying the initial structure, however, it was possible to trap the electron at the Ce1 site and optimize the geometry with a slightly less favorable adsorption energy of 1.80 eV. This resulted in a very similar molecular position and structure but with the excess spin showing that the Ce1 had now been reoxidized. The new bond lengths of Ce1OV of 2.99 Å and Ce2OV of 2.52 Å show that the elongation is slightly greater for the Ce1 when this Ce atom is reduced. The elongated bond length is actually linked to the location of the ON oxygen. This coordinates to Ce1, and the steric constraint of maintaining the interaction between Ce1 and both NO2 oxygen atoms causes the lengthening of the Ce1OV distance. The rest of the surface structure matches the expected trends with the reduced Ce having shorter bond lengths to the remaining surface O atoms.
For the bidentate mode, the single CeIII site is not directly associated with the NO2 molecule. Indeed, when a calculation was performed with the CeIII localized on one of the original CeIII sites coordinated to the NO2 molecule, the resulting adsorption energies were 0.09 eV less stable. This is not completely unexpected as both CeIII and NO2 are both effectively carrying a negative charge and hence are likely to repel each other.
The presence of a single reduced Ce ion leads to the Ce 4f derived gap state found in the electronic density of states and the observed spin density. This coupled with the NO2 density of states allows us to conclude that, upon adsorption of NO2 on a reduced (110) ceria surface, there is spontaneous reoxidation of one of the CeIII ions to CeIV and a partial reduction of the adsorbed NO2 molecule to NO2.
Discussion For vacancy formation at the (110) surface of ceria, we observe subsurface reduction coupled with surface relaxation to a split vacancy. CO adsorption results in significant tilting of the adsorption molecule and interaction of the terminal O atom of the formed carbonate group with reduced Ce in the surface. For NO2 adsorption, we observe a bidentate adsorption mode with partial surface reoxidation. None of these structures have previously been observed, and our studies show these to be energetically more stable than those previously reported.
The catalytic reactions in Table 3 are all exothermic so that the reduction of NO2 to NO and the oxidation of CO to CO2 is favored. The energy gained in the formation of CO2 from CO for the (110) surface is qualitatively consistent with the results of Sayle et al. (14, 37) where the energy gain for this reaction was reported as 3.40 eV, using an interatomic potential approach. As compared to previous results using the PW91 functional, (38) we find a more exothermic reaction for CO oxidation as compared to their result of 1.16 eV and a less exothermic reaction for NO reduction as compared to their result of 0.93 eV.

The oxygen vacancy formation energy determines the surface energetics of these catalytic reactions. The new data on vacancy formation on the (110) surface lead to energetics that are well balanced for the oxidation and reduction steps, indicating that the (110) is likely to be a suitable surface on which to study these catalytic reactions. However, the activation of the NO2 molecule is considerably less than observed previously on other ceria surface, which may indicate it is not ideal for deNOx catalysis. Further work will study the barriers to dissociation of the CO32 and NO2 groups on the surface.
Conclusion Understanding the adsorption of environmentally sensitive molecules onto the surface of ceria is vital for developing its role in catalysis. We present the geometries and energetics of vacancy formation and the adsorption of CO and NO2 onto the stoichiometric (CO) and reduced (NO2) (110) surface of ceria using density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, GGA+U. The application of GGA+U is required as it can consistently describe the properties of both the stoichiometric and the reduced surfaces, while standard DFT fails to model the reduced surface.
Vacancy formation on the (110) surface shows two different structures with the previously observed simple vacancy less stable than the split vacancy in which an adjacent oxygen takes up a position between its own lattice site and the vacancy. Examination of the electronic structure illustrates that the different vacancy geometries result in different Ce atoms being reduced. The simply vacancy reduces two ceria atoms adjacent to the vacancy, while the split vacancy results in reduction of one surface and one subsurface Ce (both of which are adjacent to the original vacancy).
The adsorption of CO on the surface of (110) produces both chemisorbed and physisorbed species. Chemisorption on two sites, the Ce-bridge and O-bridge, results in the CO molecule bridging two surface oxygen atoms and pulling these atoms out of their lattice sites, with the formation of a CO3 species. Tilting of the CO3 group results in stabilization of these modes, with the O-bridge site occurring with greater stability. The strong adsorption is accompanied by the formation of a surface carbonate species, which is confirmed through analysis of the electronic structure and is consistent with the experiment. (11) Analysis of the electronic structure for the (110) surface also shows the formation of the Ce 4f derived gap state between the valence band and the unoccupied Ce 4f states, which is a characteristic signature of reduced ceria. Reduction of two cerium atoms close to the adsorption site is confirmed by analysis of the spin density, indicating that the strong chemisorption of CO on a stoichiometric ceria surface results in the molecule being oxidized and the ceria surface being reduced.
The interaction of NO2 with the reduced (110) surface gives rise to two strong adsorption modes, the first in which one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site and the second where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. For the vacancy adsorption mode, the CeOV bond length for one of the initial CeIII ions (Ce2) is considerably smaller than that for the other (Ce1), with the lengthening of the NOV bond. Curiously, the other CeO distances show the reverse behavior with Ce1O distances reduced while Ce2O are expanded. Analysis of the electronic structure and spin density distributions demonstrates that Ce1 has been reoxidized to CeIV, with the formation of adsorbed anionic NO2 species. The extended Ce1ON bond is therefore not correlated with the reduced Ce species but with the interaction of both of the NO2 oxygen atoms. The extension of the Ce1O bond length is a result of the competition between the two oxygen atoms to interact with the Ce. The bidentate mode is symmetric with identical distances between the surface Ce atoms and the molecules O atoms. EDOS and spin density show a similar electron transfer to the molecules, but in this case the CeIII is not associated with the molecule and is found in an adjacent Ce row.
The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO and NO2 adsorption does not have a major impact on the energy. For the oxygen vacancy, two different CeIII arrangements are observed with very similar energies. CO adsorption results in a particular configuration of CeIII, but tests show that changing this for the tilted O bridge adsorption mode only changes the adsorption energy by 0.04 eV. NO2 adsorption results in two adsorption modes, both of which show similar energies when the location of the CeIII was changed. However, in all cases, the location of the CeIII is strongly coupled to the local lattice distortion, most notably with the oxygen vacancy taking up the split vacancy structure when the CeIII is subsurface.
The energetics of catalytic processes at this surface show that the steps involved are exothermic and balanced, indicating that the (110) is likely to be highly active in both oxidation and reduction catalysis. However, it should be noted that the activation of the NO2 is less than previously observed on other surfaces. (20) These results provide a detailed investigation of the interactions involved in surface reduction and the adsorption of CO and NO2 on the (110) ceria surface.
