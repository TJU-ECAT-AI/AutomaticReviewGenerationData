<p>While standard GGA/LDA functionals can model stoichiometric ceria surfaces, they fail to correctly describe the localized CeIII states produced on the formation of surface oxygen vacancies (5-7) and observed experimentally using UPS. (19) This deficiency originates from the approximate exchange found in LDA/GGA density functional theory (DFT), which results in the self-interaction error (SIE). The GGA+U methodology (22) penalizes partial occupation of the atom-centered orbitals of interest and hence can be used to counter the artificial excess delocalization caused by the SIE, allowing a qualitatively correct description of the highly localized Ce f electronic states to be recovered. (5, 7)</p>
<p>Our calculations were performed using the VASP package, (29, 30) in which the valence electronic states are expanded within a plane-wave basis. The valence-core interaction is described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) approach, (31) and cores of [He] for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and [Xe] for cerium are used. The PBE GGA exchange-correlation functional (32) is applied with the Dudarev +U. (33)</p>
<p>For the reduction and molecular adsorption calculations, the oxygen vacancies and any adsorbed molecules (CO/NO2) are present on both sides of the slab so that no net dipole moment is created. To allow adsorption energies to be obtained, calculations of isolated molecules were performed in a cubic cell with sides of 10 Å. These reference calculations used the same exchange-correlation functional and plane wave cutoff, with k-space sampling only at the Γ-point.</p>
<p>The vacancy formation energy is defined as (2) where E(CeO2x) is the energy of the slab with an oxygen vacancy on each side, E(CeO2) is the energy of the stoichiometric CeO2 slab, and E(O2(g)) is the energy of gas-phase oxygen.</p>
<p>The CO adsorption energy per adsorbate molecule is given by (3) where E(CeO2 + 2CO(ads)) is the energy of the simulation cell containing the slab with a CO molecule adsorbed on each surface, E(CeO2) is the energy of the CeO2 slab before adsorption, and E(CO(g)) is the energy of a single CO molecule in the gas phase.</p>
<p>The NO2 adsorption energy per adsorbate molecule is given by (4) where E(CeO2x + 2NO2(ads)) is the energy of the simulation cell containing the reduced slab with a NO2 molecule adsorbed on each surface, E(CeO2x) is the energy of the reduced CeO2 slab before adsorption, and E(NO2(g)) is the energy of a single NO2 molecule in the gas phase.</p>
<p>Negative adsorption energies signify that the adsorption structure is stabilized as compared to the initially isolated species. Small adsorption energies, on the order of a few tenths of an eV, show a weak interaction between the molecule and the surface and are coupled to small perturbations to either molecular or surface structure. Large adsorption energies, on the order of 1 eV or greater, indicate a strong interaction between the molecule and the surface and are expected to be accompanied by strong perturbation to the structure of the molecule and the surface.</p>
<p>The atom projected electronic densities of states (EDOS) for both structures are similar (Figure 2), displaying an occupied gap state. Projection of the corresponding KohnSham orbitals onto atom-centered spherical harmonics shows this state is mainly composed of Ce 4f states. Integration of the defect peak gives two electrons per oxygen vacancy, and the spin density (defined as the difference between the up spin density and the down spin density) shows that two cerium atoms have been reduced (Figure 3) in agreement with previous studies. (5, 6) The simple vacancy, as previously reported, shows reduction of the surface atoms (Figure 3a). In contrast, the split vacancy shows reduction of one surface atom and one subsurface atom (Ce3; Figure 3b).</p>
<p>Several competing modes are observed for CO adsorption on the stoichiometric (110) surface. One of these is a physisorbed state, with an adsorption energy of 0.20 eV, similar to that previously observed. (16) Two chemisorbed modes are observed in which the CO is perpendicular to the surface. In both cases, the CO carbon approaches the surface between two surface O atoms, which are pulled slightly out of the surface layer. This gives a surface-bound species with the appearance of a CO3 group. Because the (110) surface only has Ce present in alternate rows, this perpendicular adsorption can occur with the carbon located above a cerium row (Ce-bridging) or located between oxygens where there is no Ce row (O-bridging). The perpendicular Ce-bridging mode (Figure 4a) is similar to the mode observed by Nolan et al., (16) which we calculated to have an adsorption energy of 1.78 eV. Adsorption at the O-bridge site is more stable, as previously noted by Fabris (17) and Yang, (15) with an adsorption energy of 3.48 eV. The greater stability is due to the C atom being able to approach the surface more closely in the absence of the surface Ce atoms, as compared to the Ce-bridging mode.</p>
<p>The interaction of NO2 with the reduced (110) surface gives rise to two strong adsorption modes, the first in which one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site and the second where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. For the vacancy adsorption mode, the CeOV bond length for one of the initial CeIII ions (Ce2) is considerably smaller than that for the other (Ce1), with the lengthening of the NOV bond. Curiously, the other CeO distances show the reverse behavior with Ce1O distances reduced while Ce2O are expanded. Analysis of the electronic structure and spin density distributions demonstrates that Ce1 has been reoxidized to CeIV, with the formation of adsorbed anionic NO2 species. The extended Ce1ON bond is therefore not correlated with the reduced Ce species but with the interaction of both of the NO2 oxygen atoms. The bidentate mode is symmetric with identical distances between the surface Ce atoms and the molecules O atoms. EDOS and spin density show a similar electron transfer to the molecules, but in this case the CeIII is not associated with the molecule and is found in an adjacent Ce row.</p>
<p>For the oxygen vacancy, two different CeIII arrangements are observed with very similar energies. CO adsorption results in a particular configuration of CeIII, but tests show that changing this for the tilted O bridge adsorption mode only changes the adsorption energy by 0.04 eV. NO2 adsorption results in two adsorption modes, both of which show similar energies when the location of the CeIII was changed. However, in all cases, the location of the CeIII is strongly coupled to the local lattice distortion, most notably with the oxygen vacancy taking up the split vacancy structure when the CeIII is subsurface.</p>
<p>The energetics of catalytic processes at this surface show that the steps involved are exothermic and balanced, indicating that the (110) is likely to be highly active in both oxidation and reduction catalysis. However, it should be noted that the activation of the NO2 is less than previously observed on other surfaces. (20) These results provide a detailed investigation of the interactions involved in surface reduction and the adsorption of CO and NO2 on the (110) ceria surface.</p>
<p>Understanding the adsorption of environmentally sensitive molecules onto the surface of ceria is vital for developing its role in catalysis. We present the geometries and energetics of vacancy formation and the adsorption of CO and NO2 onto the stoichiometric (CO) and reduced (NO2) (110) surface of ceria using density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, GGA+U. The application of GGA+U is required as it can consistently describe the properties of both the stoichiometric and the reduced surfaces, while standard DFT fails to model the reduced surface.</p>
<p>Vacancy formation on the (110) surface shows two different structures with the previously observed simple vacancy less stable than the split vacancy in which an adjacent oxygen takes up a position between its own lattice site and the vacancy. Examination of the electronic structure illustrates that the different vacancy geometries result in different Ce atoms being reduced. The simply vacancy reduces two ceria atoms adjacent to the vacancy, while the split vacancy results in reduction of one surface and one subsurface Ce (both of which are adjacent to the original vacancy).</p>
<p>The adsorption of CO on the surface of (110) produces both chemisorbed and physisorbed species. Chemisorption on two sites, the Ce-bridge and O-bridge, results in the CO molecule bridging two surface oxygen atoms and pulling these atoms out of their lattice sites, with the formation of a CO3 species. Tilting of the CO3 group results in stabilization of these modes, with the O-bridge site occurring with greater stability. The strong adsorption is accompanied by the formation of a surface carbonate species, which is confirmed through analysis of the electronic structure and is consistent with the experiment. (11) Analysis of the electronic structure for the (110) surface also shows the formation of the Ce 4f derived gap state between the valence band and the unoccupied Ce 4f states, which is a characteristic signature of reduced ceria. Reduction of two cerium atoms close to the adsorption site is confirmed by analysis of the spin density, indicating that the strong chemisorption of CO on a stoichiometric ceria surface results in the molecule being oxidized and the ceria surface being reduced.</p>
<p>The interaction of NO2 with the reduced (110) surface gives rise to two strong adsorption modes, the first in which one of the NO2 oxygen atoms occupies the vacancy site and the second where a bidentate adsorption mode is formed with each of the NO2 oxygen atoms coordinating to adjacent Ce atoms in the Ce row. For the vacancy adsorption mode, the CeOV bond length for one of the initial CeIII ions (Ce2) is considerably smaller than that for the other (Ce1), with the lengthening of the NOV bond. Curiously, the other CeO distances show the reverse behavior with Ce1O distances reduced while Ce2O are expanded. Analysis of the electronic structure and spin density distributions demonstrates that Ce1 has been reoxidized to CeIV, with the formation of adsorbed anionic NO2 species. The extended Ce1ON bond is therefore not correlated with the reduced Ce species but with the interaction of both of the NO2 oxygen atoms. The bidentate mode is symmetric with identical distances between the surface Ce atoms and the molecules O atoms. EDOS and spin density show a similar electron transfer to the molecules, but in this case the CeIII is not associated with the molecule and is found in an adjacent Ce row.</p>
<p>The location of the CeIII sites on oxygen vacancy formation and CO and NO2 adsorption does not have a major impact on the energy. For the oxygen vacancy, two different CeIII arrangements are observed with very similar energies. CO adsorption results in a particular configuration of CeIII, but tests show that changing this for the tilted O bridge adsorption mode only changes the adsorption energy by 0.04 eV. NO2 adsorption results in two adsorption modes, both of which show similar energies when the location of the CeIII was changed.
