Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation through detailed simulations of the interactions between the catalyst surface and the adsorbed molecules. Key considerations are the accuracy and efficiency of these theoretical predictions. Challenges include high computational costs and the need for precise input parameters. Potential benefits include the exploration of new catalytic materials and optimization of existing ones, which can be achieved without the limitations of experimental setups.
