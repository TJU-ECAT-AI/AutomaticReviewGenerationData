The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof screened hybrid functional method was employed to evaluate energy band gaps and lattice parameters. This approach enhances the prediction, analysis, and understanding of the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing accurate electronic structure calculations. However, the literature does not specifically address computational methods' enhancement in predicting catalytic activity or the exploration of new catalytic materials. The document focuses more on the technical aspects of applying density functional theory and does not delve into the detailed application to doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation.
