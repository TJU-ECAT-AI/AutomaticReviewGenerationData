The Colle-Salvetti correlation-energy formula has been developed into a functional of the electron density through various mathematical transformations. This conversion facilitates the calculation of correlation energy using density-functional theory. The derived formulas allow for the representation of correlation energies in terms of density and kinetic-energy density, enabling more accurate predictions of such energies. These formulations are particularly useful in quantum chemistry computations, offering a means to describe the interactions between electrons in molecules or atoms with enhanced precision. The second-order gradient expansion formulas are used to approximate the correlation energy, providing excellent representations of actual correlation energies across different systems, including atoms, positive ions, and molecules of both open- and closed-shell types.
