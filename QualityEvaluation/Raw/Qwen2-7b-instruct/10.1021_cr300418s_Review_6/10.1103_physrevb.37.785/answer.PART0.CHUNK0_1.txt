[1] "Equations (10) and (15) lack of being pure density functionals only because of the appearance in them of the Hartree-Pock local kinetic-energy densities tHF, tHF,and t HF, which depend on individual orbital densities."
[2] "These quantities too are functionals of the density, and Eqs. (10) and (15) are pure density-functional expressions [as would be Eq. (3) with this interpretation]."
[3] "The correlation energy formulas of Eqs. (10) and (15) then become E,= a & p+bp '"tCt p'" 2tw +( ,'tw+-, ', 'P)& " 1+dp (21)"
[4] "The zero-order formulas are obtained by striking out the terms within the parentheses in each case. The zero-order mean-path formula is obtained by replacing ,', with ,', in these terms."

Density functional theory (DFT) plays a pivotal role in predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. The key considerations involve ensuring the accuracy of the DFT calculations, optimizing computational efficiency, and exploring the properties of new catalytic materials. Challenges in DFT include the limitations of approximations used in functional forms, such as those in equations (10) and (15), which rely on orbital densities. These equations can be transformed into pure density-functional expressions by considering the orbitals as Kohn-Sham orbitals, enhancing their applicability. The formulas derived through gradient expansions, like equations (21) and (22), offer improved representations of correlation energies compared to the original equations. Zero-order and mean-path formulas provide simpler alternatives, albeit with slightly less accuracy. The use of DFT, therefore, enables detailed insights into the catalytic mechanisms while balancing computational demands and accuracy requirements.

密度泛函理论（DFT）在预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活中的催化活性方面发挥着关键作用。考虑的关键因素包括确保DFT计算的准确性，优化计算效率，并探索新催化材料的性质。DFT面临的挑战包括在功能形式中使用近似值的限制，这些形式依赖于轨道密度。通过将轨道视为Kohn-Sham轨道，可以将等式（10）和（15）转换为纯密度泛函表达式，从而增强其适用性。通过梯度展开导出的公式，如等式（21）和（22），提供了与原始等式相比更好的相关能表示。零阶和平均路径公式提供了更简单的替代方案，尽管准确度略低。因此，使用DFT能够提供详细的催化机制洞察，同时平衡计算需求和准确性要求。
