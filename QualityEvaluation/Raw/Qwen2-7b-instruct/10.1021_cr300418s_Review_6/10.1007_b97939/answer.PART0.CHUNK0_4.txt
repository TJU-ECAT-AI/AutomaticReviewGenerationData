Computational methods, especially Density Functional Theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by enabling the prediction of reaction pathways and product distributions. These methods allow for the simulation of local environments around active sites, facilitating the optimization of parameters within models for new catalytic materials. Key considerations involve balancing computational cost with predictive power while addressing challenges such as electron correlation treatment and extrapolating results to real conditions. Potential benefits include accelerating the discovery process and reducing experimental costs.
