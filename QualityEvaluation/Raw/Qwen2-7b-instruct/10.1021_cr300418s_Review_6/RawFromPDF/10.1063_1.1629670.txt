The dynamics of Cl atom reactions with methane, ethane, and methanol have been studied by
calculation of quasi-classical trajectories, with computation of potential energies and gradients only
at the geometries through which the trajectories pass. Trajectories were started from the transition
state, with 2 kcal mol21 of energy given to the mode with an imaginary frequency ~representing the
reaction coordinate at the transition state! and inclusion of zero-point energy in some or all of the
remaining vibrational modes. The trajectories were propagated as far as separated products, with the
majority of potential energy calculations performed at the HF/6-31G level of theory. The rotational
quantum state population distributions of the HCl products from the reactions of Cl atoms with
methane, ethane and methanol peaked at J851, 2, and 6, respectively. The calculations thereby
exhibit somewhat greater rotational excitation than is found experimentally, but correctly describe
the trend of increasing HCl product rotation for the three respective reactions. In agreement with
previous observations, only 4% of the energy available to the products of the reaction of Cl atoms
with methane was channeled into CH3 radical internal energy, and 1% into HCl rotation, with 92%
ending up as translational energy. For the reaction of Cl atoms with ethane and with methanol, the
corresponding values for radical internal energy, HCl rotation and product translation are 21, 3, and
78%, and 46, 13, and 42%, respectively. For the latter two reactions, the radical internal energy is
mostly accounted for by rotational motion. The clear increase in rotational excitation of the HCl
products from the Cl atom reaction with methanol is explained in terms of a dipole-dipole
interaction between the departing polar fragments. A smaller set of more computationally expensive
trajectory calculations using potentials and gradients from the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of theory
were performed for reactions of Cl atoms with methanol, and give results in better agreement with
experimentally measured HCl rotational excitation, consistent with the model of dipole-induced
product rotation because the MP2/6-311G(d,p) calculations give smaller dipole moments for both
products than the HF/6-31G calculations. The calculated angles between the rotational angular
momentum vectors and recoil velocities of the radical peak sharply at 90° for the reactions of Cl
atoms with ethane and methanol, but exhibit a much broader distribution for reaction with methane.

I. INTRODUCTION
Our previous experimental studies of the dynamics of
reactions of chlorine atoms with methanol, ethanol, dimethyl
ether,1,2 and methylamine3 showed that hydrogen abstraction
from the carbon atom bonded to oxygen or nitrogen gives
HCl that is signiﬁcantly more rotationally excited than are
the HCl products of Cl atom reactions with alkanes.4–6 The
source of this greater HCl rotation was attributed to a dipole-
dipole interaction between the separating HCl product and
polar radical co-product. Each reaction pathway exhibits a
shallow well in the exit valley of the potential energy surface
~PES! that is, in part, a consequence of this dipole-dipole
interaction, and which may inﬂuence the reaction dynamics.
In order to gain further insight into the different dynamics of
reaction of Cl atoms with alkanes and oxygenated organic
molecules, we report fully dimensional classical trajectory
calculations for the reactions of ground vibrational state
methane, ethane, and methanol, and compare the results with
available experimental data.
Theoretical studies of reaction dynamics are an invalu-
able aide to understanding experimental data, and thereby
extracting as much insight as possible from the latter. In
particular, classical ~or quasi-classical! trajectory studies, de-
spite their known limitations arising from the neglect of most
quantum effects, are of great worth given their ready visual
interpretation.7 Traditionally, one of the main hurdles to be
overcome in applying this classical trajectory method is the
need to obtain an accurate analytical parametrization of the
Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface for the reaction.
Such parametrizations are complicated, high-dimensional
functions, so extensive testing and validation is needed to
check that no important artifacts have been introduced. With
the increasing power of computers and software, many re-
cent classical trajectory studies have avoided this parametri-
zation by computing the potential energy surface and its
gradient at each trajectory point directly using electronic

structure methods. As discussed below, the computational
expense
of
this
approach,
referred
to
as
‘‘direct
dynamics,’’8,9 does however require a compromise to be
made between the accuracy of the electronic structure
method and the number of trajectories propagated.
The reactions of Cl atoms with both ground and vibra-
tionally excited methane and ethane have been intensively
studied both experimentally and theoretically. Ab initio
calculations10–13 characterized the system energetics and sta-
tionary points on the ground PES, and predicted the Cl–H–C
part of the transition state ~TS! to be linear in both reactions.
Levine and co-workers14 constructed a number of model
PESs for the Cl1CH4 reaction system and performed a de-
tailed dynamical study via classical trajectory calculations.
They found that the essential features of the dynamics are
insensitive to the level of detail with which the CH3 group is
described. Reduced-dimensionality quantum scattering cal-
culations have also been applied to the study of this
reaction,15–18 and enabled an examination of the effects of
CH4 bend excitation on the rotational distribution of HCl.19
Troya
et al.20
recently
reported
the
use
of
reduced-
dimensionality quasi-classical trajectory ~QCT! calculations
on an analytical PES for the Cl1CH4 reaction and, among
other things, were able to infer HCl ro-vibrational state spe-
ciﬁc scattering angle distributions. These intensive theoreti-
cal investigations were stimulated by a series of experimen-
tal studies of the reaction dynamics4–6,21 in which state-to-
state differential cross sections and HCl rotational level
population distributions were measured. The HCl proved to
be very rotationally cold in all studied reactions of Cl atoms
with alkanes. The ﬁrst studies concluded that, for both the
reactions of methane and ethane, only a small fraction of the
available energy was released as internal energy of the radi-
cal
(CH3
or
C2H5)
product,5,6
although
recent
re-
investigation by Brouard and co-workers questions this out-
come for the ethane reaction.22
The potential energy surfaces for reactions of Cl atoms
with CH4 , C2H6 and CH3OH are qualitatively similar, with
weak encounter complexes on both the reactant and product
sides of the low-lying C–H abstraction TS. Figure 1 shows
the energetics of these stationary points, calculated at the
G2//MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of ab initio electronic structure
theory.1 The geometry of the TS in all three cases exhibits a
near-linear C–H–Cl conﬁguration. The van der Waals wells
associated with the encounter complexes are so shallow in
the case of the methane and ethane surfaces that they are
expected to have no impact upon the dynamics, which
should therefore be direct. Calculations of stationary point
energies and geometries for the reaction of Cl atoms with
methanol demonstrate that reaction proceeds along a mini-
mum energy pathway that incorporates lower energy pre-
and post-transition state intermediate complexes,1,23 bound
by 24.64 and 29.64 kcal mol21, respectively, relative to the
reagent energies. The differential cross sections reported by
Ahmed et al.24 from crossed molecular beams and velocity
map imaging experiments showed scattering that is predomi-
nantly in the backward/sideways direction, suggesting direct
~despite the potential wells! rebound dynamics, but recent
experiments from Kitsopoulos and co-workers demonstrate
that there is also a strong forward scattered component.25
In the present study, we have carried out initial ab initio
characterization of the reactions of Cl atoms with methane,
ethane and methanol by calculating the energetics, geom-
etries and vibrational frequencies of reagents, molecular
complexes, transition states and products at various levels of
electronic structure theory. A direct dynamics, ‘‘on-the-ﬂy’’
QCT study of the post-transition state dynamics was then
carried out using potential energies and gradients computed
both at the HF/6-31G and MP2/6-311G(d,p) levels, avoid-
ing the need to construct global PESs or to invoke reduced
dimensionality approximations for the dynamics. From
batches of hundreds or thousands of trajectories, HCl and
radical product rotational angular momentum distributions,
energy partitioning, and vector correlations for each system
were derived, and the results are compared with previous
experimental and theoretical studies. The values of the cal-
culated dipole moments of the HCl and radical products de-
pend markedly upon the level of theory used, and are seen to
correlate well with the calculated degree of HCl rotational
excitation.
II. METHODS OF CALCULATION
Ab initio electronic structure calculations were per-
formed at several levels of theory to optimize geometries and
energies and calculate zero-point harmonic vibrational fre-
quencies in order to characterize stationary points ~reagents,
molecular complexes, transition states and products! on the
PESs of the systems studied. At the lowest level of theory
employed, closed and open shell species were calculated us-
ing restricted and restricted-open-shell Hartree–Fock ~RHF
and ROHF! self-consistent ﬁeld ~SCF! wave functions, re-
spectively, with the 6-31G basis set. The stationary points
were also characterized in the same way ~geometry optimi-
zation and zero-point harmonic frequency calculation! with
the inclusion of electron correlation using second-order
Møller–Plesset perturbation theory ~MP2! and a larger

ometry of the Cl–H–CH2OH transition state, calculated at the MP2/

stricted Hartree–Fock reference was used, and the core elec-
trons

were

@UMP2~FC! calculations#. The single point energies were
further reﬁned using a variation of the composite G2
method,26,27 termed G2//MP2/6-311G(d,p). All HF/6-31G
calculations were performed using GAMESS-USA28 while the
GAUSSIAN 98 package29 was used for MP2/6-311G(d,p) and
G2 level calculations.
The on-the-ﬂy trajectory calculations require computa-
tion of potential energies and gradients along all coordinates,
calculated for every geometry sampled by each trajectory in
passing from the starting point to the separated products. The
trajectories are computationally intensive ~in total, our calcu-
lations used more than 2 years of CPU time! and thus a
balance must be struck between the level of theory used for
ab initio calculations and the overall accuracy of the results.
Two levels of electronic structure theory calculation were
used to test the dependence of the outcomes of the trajecto-
ries on the accuracy of the ab initio energetics and structures.
In the more computationally economic and thus much faster
calculations, HF/6-31G calculations were used, and these
were
tested
against
calculations
performed
at
the
MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. All calculations neglect
any effects of spin-orbit splitting in the Cl atoms, and all
were performed on a Beowulf cluster of 45 networked, dual-
processor ~1.8 GHz, 1 Gb RAM per node! personal comput-
ers ~PCs!.
The use of HF and MP2 level theory in direct dynamics
calculations of chemical processes has some precedent.30–32
For example, an HF direct dynamics study of product state
distributions in photodissociation of formaldehyde33 gave
reasonable agreement with experiment even though the HF
level exaggerated the relevant barrier height ~as happens
here, too—see below!. In a later study,34 more expensive
MP2/6-311G(d,p) calculations were used for the potential
energy surface, and improved results were obtained. One
way to obtain accurate barrier heights at a very low compu-
tational cost is to use semi-empirical electronic structure
methods, using system-optimized parameters adjusted so as
to reproduce certain features of the potential energy surface
calculated at a high level of theory.35 For the formaldehyde
case, however, it proved difﬁcult to obtain an overall satis-
factory potential energy surface using this approach and the
agreement with experiment was in fact poorer than with
HF.36
At the HF/6-31G level, batches of 2000 trajectories were
initiated close to the corresponding transition states ~TS!,
using the set of initial conditions described below, and inte-
grated classically, with ab initio calculation of the potential
and forces carried out at each time step in the propagation.37
Integration of the classical equations of motion was executed
by the use of a velocity Verlet algorithm,38 with a time step
of 0.2 fs, until certain termination criteria had been achieved,
typically after 1000–2000 steps. A small number of trajecto-
ries were observed to recross into the reactant region, and
these were discarded. We note that the use of classical me-
chanics means that some trajectories can lead to products
with signiﬁcantly less energy than the nominal ‘‘zero-point’’
level; such trajectories were however included in all product
state averages. A successful trajectory was terminated when
the classical rotational angular momentum of the product
HCl was stable to better than DJ850.0001 between sequen-
tial steps and the distance between the Cl and C atoms was at
least 7 Å, thereby ensuring that the interaction energy of the
products was negligible. Throughout each trajectory, the total
energy was conserved to 0.02 mHartree or better.
Computational
restrictions
linked
with
unfavorable
barrier-crossing statistics mean that it is not possible to
sample the initial conditions for separated reactants. Since
our main interest is product state distributions, we instead
use initial conditions approximately representative of barrier-
crossing events relevant to our, and other, experimental set-
ups. Typically, hyperthermal chlorine atoms are produced by
photodissociation, leading to center-of-mass frame colli-
sional energies of ;6 kcal mol21.1–6 At these energies, and
given that reaction usually occurs in a direct manner, most of
the reactive events will occur through the transition state
with only a moderate amount of vibrational energy in the
transverse modes, and we therefore chose to include only
zero-point energy in these modes. The unstudied inﬂuence of
a pre-reactive complex in the reaction of Cl atoms with
methanol may be to couple energy into the vibrational levels
of the transition state. Moreover, certain translational and
rotational degrees of freedom of the separated reagents for
all the reactions will evolve into bending modes of the tran-
sition state orthogonal to the reaction coordinate and may
result in TS excitation. Our choice of zero-point level start-
ing conditions should thus be viewed with appropriate cau-
tion.
The remaining energy was placed in the reaction coordi-
nate. Speciﬁcally, computing and diagonalizing the transition
state Hessian matrix ~at the same level of theory used for
trajectory propagation! yielded the frequencies and eigenvec-
tors, and 2 kcal mol21 of kinetic energy was given to the
system in the direction of the imaginary mode, with the ve-
locity oriented towards the products. To allow for zero-point
energy ~ZPE! in the remaining transverse modes, random
initial displacements and velocities for each vibrational mode
were
individually
selected
according
to
the
Wigner
distribution39 of the corresponding ground state harmonic os-
cillator wave function. Although sampling initial geometries
through displacement along rectilinear normal mode coordi-
nates may introduce some total angular momentum, tests
show that this is small (L'0), and we did not introduce
additional rotation. Hence, the initial conditions sample only
the outcome from low impact-parameter, low orbital angular
momentum collisions. Excess energy of the reagents above
the barrier height may excite rotational motion of the transi-
tion state via larger impact parameter collisions, which will
distribute into product rotation and orbital angular momen-
tum. We thus highlight a limitation of our current calcula-
tions that will be addressed in future developments.
We believe that although all of these choices mean that
the initial conditions used are not fully representative of the
experiments, uncertainties concerning the potential energy
surface are likely to be more important, and the approach
used here should give at least a reasonable picture of the

post-transition state dynamics of the bulk of the observed
reactive events. The HF calculations give a particularly poor
description of the energetics of the pre-transition state re-
gions of the potentials for the various reactions ~vide infra!,
so it is preferable to select the initial conditions for trajecto-
ries using considerations based on the post-transition state
energetics, rather than to duplicate the collision energies of
the experiments. As is demonstrated later, our choice of start-
ing kinetic energies results in almost equivalent available
energies for the products of the three reactions, similar in
magnitude to the experimental conditions, and thus facili-
tates intercomparison between the outcomes of the calcula-
tions and further comparisons with experimental results. We
note also that the Wigner sampling method used does not
give a constant energy set of initial conditions. Other meth-
ods for sampling initial conditions have been described,40
and allow, e.g., microcanonical ensembles to be obtained,
and can also enable the total available energy to be distrib-
uted between the reaction coordinate and the transverse
modes as in transition state theory. Again, we do not believe
that these other approaches are clearly superior to those used
here, given the signiﬁcant inaccuracies in the potential en-
ergy function.
In order to examine the inﬂuence of classical sampling
of the bending motion of the Cl–H–C group in the TS on
HCl product rotational distributions, a second batch of 2000
HF/6-31G trajectories was run and analyzed using slightly
different initial conditions. For these trajectories, the zero-
point energy was not included for any of the vibrational nor-
mal modes that upon inspection were found to involve a
signiﬁcant amount of this type of bending motion. The other
modes were treated as described above. The constrained vi-
brational modes of the TS are speciﬁed in Sec. III B. In ad-
dition, single trajectories were computed from the unique
starting geometries that arise from having no zero-point mo-
tion in any of the normal modes of the TSs.
Quantities of interest were calculated from the coordi-
nates and velocity vectors of the atoms, furnished by the
algorithm at the termination of the trajectory. The rotational
quantum numbers of the HCl and radical fragment were cal-
culated from their instantaneous coordinates and velocity
vectors, and quantized by rounding to the nearest integer
value. The internal ~vibrational! energy of the HCl product is
treated as the sum of kinetic and potential energy contribu-
tions. The kinetic fraction is calculated from the components
of the velocity vectors of the H and Cl atoms along the
internuclear axis. The potential part is calculated from the
internuclear separation using a cubic spline ﬁt of the poten-
tial energy curve of isolated HCl calculated at the same HF
or MP2 level of theory used to propagate the trajectories.
The HCl and radical translational energies were calculated
straightforwardly from the center-of-mass velocity of each,
and the internal energy of the radical fragment was deter-
mined by energy conservation. The distributions of angles
between the calculated vector properties ~HCl and radical
fragment center-of-mass velocities and classical rotational
angular momenta! were also evaluated to allow comparison
with experimentally measured vector correlations.
To test the effects of the level of ab initio theory used to
calculate potential energies and gradients on the outcome of
the dynamics, a smaller batch of 270 trajectories was propa-
gated for the Cl1CH3OH reaction using MP2/6-311G(d,p)
rather than HF/6-31G calculations. The starting conditions of
energies, geometries and frequencies were all calculated at
the same MP2/6-311G(d,p) level, using the GAUSSIAN 98
program, with initial sampling carried out over all transverse
vibrational
modes. The
computational
expense
of
the
MP2/6-311G(d,p) calculations prohibited running a larger
batch of trajectories—on our system, an individual trajectory
at this level took approximately 2 days, compared with ;45
min at the HF/6-31G level.

A. Energies and geometries

The
G2//MP2/6-311G(d,p) calculations involve the standard G2
method but using a larger basis set than is usual to calculate
geometries and zero-point energies. The outcomes of the cal-
culations are compared with experimentally determined exo-
thermicities. As can be seen, the HF level gives very poor
agreement with experiment, and with the higher-level calcu-
lations, for the overall reaction energy and for the height of
the barrier to forward reaction. This poor behavior was main-
tained ~or even worsened! by using larger basis sets. How-
ever, the barrier height to the reverse reaction, that is, the
energy difference between the TS and the products, while
still too high, is in better agreement, and this is one of the
most important factors inﬂuencing the post-barrier dynamics

that are our focus of interest. The geometry of the transition
states is also fairly well described by the HF/6-31G calcula-
tions ~see below!. These observations, combined with com-
putational expense considerations, motivated our choice of
the HF/6-31G method for the bulk of the trajectory calcula-
tions. As a check of the reliability of the approach, however,
the outcomes of these trajectories are later compared with
calculations employing higher level ab initio theory.
The inset to Fig. 1 shows the optimized geometry of the
transition state for the reaction of a Cl atom with a methanol
molecule, calculated at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level, together
with the individual atomic velocity vectors for the vibra-
tional mode with imaginary frequency. The values of impor-
tant optimized geometrical parameters for the transition
states of the reactions of Cl atoms with methane, ethane, and
methanol
are
listed
in
Table
II
for
HF/6-31G
and
MP2/6-311G(d,p) calculations. Comparison of the Cl–H
and H–C distances at the two levels of theory demonstrates
that TS geometries at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level are com-
puted to be more reactant-like, but the Cl–H–C angle does
not change signiﬁcantly with method of calculation. Table III
presents harmonic vibrational frequencies for Cl–H–R (R
5CH3 ,CH2CH3 ,CH2OH) transition states at both the HF/6-
31G and MP2/6-311G(d,p) levels of theory. Values of the
computed imaginary frequencies of the vibrational modes
along the reaction coordinate differ signiﬁcantly for the two
methods of calculation. In particular, for the Cl–H–CH2OH
transition state, the imaginary frequency is almost eight
times
bigger
at
the
HF/6-31G
level
than
at
the
MP2/6-311G(d,p) level. For all three reactions, the vector
of the vibrational mode describing the abstraction of the hy-
drogen atom ~i.e., the reaction coordinate! at the HF/6-31G
level is directed along the Cl–H–C direction while the re-
maining hydrogen and nonhydrogenic atoms bonded to the
carbon atom undergo umbrella mode type vibrations. Calcu-
lated orientations of the vector corresponding to the reaction
coordinate at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level are in good agree-
ment with the results from the HF calculations, apart from
the Cl1CH3OH reaction system for which the vector de-
scribing the abstraction of hydrogen deviates by ;20–25°
from the Cl–C and H–C lines.

B. Trajectories with HFÕ6-31G potentials
Trajectories were run for each reaction system using po-
tential energies and gradients calculated on the ﬂy at the
HF/6-31G level of theory, with selection of the starting con-
ditions using three different models for incorporation of the
vibrational zero-point energy. Two thousand trajectories were
propagated from the transition state with incorporation of
zero-point motion and energy in all the vibrational modes
listed in Table III, and a further 2000 trajectories were com-
puted with the zero-point energies set to zero in the modes
marked by asterisks in Table III. These vibrational modes of
the TS were identiﬁed to contain components of Cl–H–C
bending motion. Finally, single trajectories were propagated
from the TS geometry with no ZPE in any vibrational modes
and a small amount of energy along the reaction coordinate.
For trajectories with the ZPE included in all vibrational
modes, more than 95% ﬁnished normally, i.e., they resulted
in dissociation into HCl and a radical fragment, while the
remainder recrossed the transition state and reverted back to
separated reagents. Trajectories for the Cl1CH3OH system
were started only from the Cl–H–CH2OH transition state,
from which a methyl hydrogen is abstracted, as the alterna-
tive channel leading to HCl and a methoxy radical is known
to be a negligible pathway.41
The average times for trajectories to complete were
;190, 210, and 380 fs for Cl atom reaction with methane,
ethane and methanol, respectively, showing no propensity for
formation of long-lived complexes. Rotational periods about
the three principal axes of the Cl–H–CH2OH transition state
structure were calculated from the computed rotational con-
stants, and, for a total rotational angular momentum J51,
the shortest rotational period is 10 ps, decreasing to 1 ps for
J510. The reaction dynamics are thus best viewed as being
direct. Sample trajectories representative of each reaction
were animated to provide a convenient visualization of the
reaction dynamics.42 The reactions of Cl with CH4 and C2H6
show no substantial torques in the HCl, and thus little
asymptotic rotation. For reaction with CH3OH, however, the
H atom of the nascent HCl molecule can be seen to reorient
to track the electronegative O atom in the CH2OH fragment,
as we previously postulated,1,2 and the associated torque
from an angularly anisotropic post-TS PES induces HCl ro-
tation as the products begin to separate. The results described
here, however, concentrate on statistical outcomes for
batches of trajectories because these can be compared di-
rectly with experimental measurements.
Figure 2 shows the computed distributions of HCl prod-
ucts over rotational quantum states from the reactions of Cl
atoms with methane, ethane and methanol. The calculated
distributions are compared with experimental results,1,2,4–6
with the distributions normalized such that the sums of rela-
tive populations of J8 levels up to J854, 6, and 11 for the
methane, ethane and methanol reactions are unity. The
shapes and widths of the experimental rotational distribu-
tions are well reproduced by the calculations, but all the
calculated data show long tails of low population in high J8
levels that continue, with low probability, as far as J8521
for the alkane reactions. These very high J8 values are not
energetically accessible in the experiments. The mean rota-
tional energies of the HCl products of the reactions between
Cl atoms and CH4 , C2H6, and CH3OH are calculated from
the classical angular momenta of the products, with exclu-
sion of the respective high J8 tails beyond J854, 6, and 11,
to be ^Erot&542 cm21 (0.12 kcal mol21), 94 cm21 ~0.27
kcal mol21!, and 400 cm21 ~1.14 kcal mol21!. The respective
experimental values are 3165 ~Ref. 5, or 59 cm21 from Ref.
4!, 6965 ~Ref. 1!, and 330629 cm21 ~Ref. 1!, i.e., 0.09
60.01 ~or 0.17!, 0.2060.1, and 0.9460.08 kcal mol21, re-
spectively. All further analysis of properties of the batches of
trajectories excludes those trajectories that produce HCl with
binned J8 values greater than the chosen maxima speciﬁed
above to avoid skewing of energy distributions. The theoret-
ical results calculated at the HF/6-31G level of theory are
more rotationally excited than the experimental measure-
ments by 1 to 2 units of J8, but correctly describe the in-
crease in HCl rotational excitation in going from reaction
with methane to ethane and methanol. There is excellent,
quantitative agreement between the calculated and measured
rotational distributions for the reaction of Cl atoms with
methanol if the former distribution is shifted down by two
units of J8. The calculations thus reproduce the width and
shape of the HCl rotational distribution, but not the mean.
Trajectories were also initiated with no ZPE in the
modes identiﬁed by asterisks in Table III ~those modes con-
taining an element of Cl–H–C bending! at the HF/6-31G

level. In these calculations, the HCl products from reactions
of Cl atoms with methane and ethane are mainly produced
with J850, with the probabilities for higher J8 levels falling
sharply. No products with J8>3 were observed for the meth-
ane reaction, or for J8>2 in the ethane reaction. Trajectories
for the Cl1CH3OH reaction computed with no ZPE in the
Cl–H–C bending modes gave an HCl product rotational dis-
tribution which peaks at J857 and has a width of approxi-
mately 61 units of J8. The maxima of these distributions
coincide with the HCl J8 values for the single trajectories run
from ﬁxed TS geometries with no ZPE in any vibrational
modes, and just 2 kcal mol21 given to the reaction coordi-
nate. The primary effect of the Cl–H–C bending modes at
the transition state is to broaden the distribution of HCl ro-
tational levels populated by the reaction, but in the Cl
1alkane reactions, a small shift upwards in the maximum of
the computed distribution by 1 or 2 units of J8 is also ob-
served.
Distributions of the total translational energy of the
products ~i.e., HCl and the radical CH3 , CH2CH3 , or
CH2OH) are shown in Fig. 3 for trajectories initiated from
TSs incorporating zero-point motion in all vibrational
modes. The total translational energy of the HCl1CH3 prod-
ucts of reaction of Cl atoms with methane has an average
value of 8.42 kcal mol21 and a FWHM of the calculated
distribution of 5.65 kcal mol21. The reverse barrier height for
this reaction, with correction for ZPEs, is 9.27 kcal mol21,
and 2 kcal mol21 of energy was put into the mode corre-
sponding to the reaction coordinate. The mean value of the
total energy available to the products was, however, found to
be 9.11 kcal mol21 from analysis of successful trajectories.
This energy is lower than expected from the chosen initial
conditions, in part because sampling from a Wigner distribu-
tion does not give a constant energy, but also because the
zero point energies are computed in a harmonic approxima-
tion, whereas the potentials for the numerous normal modes
will be anharmonic. Thus, of the 9.11 kcal mol21 of mean
available energy, 92% is partitioned on average into transla-
tional energy of the products, and for the reaction of Cl at-
oms with ethane, 78% of the 7.70 kcal mol21 mean available
energy becomes translational energy of the HCl and C2H5
products. In contrast, for reaction of Cl atoms with methanol,
the average translational energy of the HCl and CH2OH
products is computed to be 3.68 kcal mol21, which amounts
to just 42% of the average available energy of 8.86
kcal mol21.
Figure 4 presents HF/6-31G level calculated distribu-
tions of the internal ~rotational plus vibrational! energies of
the radical co-products for reactions of Cl atoms with meth-
ane, ethane and methanol. The respective average energies
are 4.54, 4.21, and 5.29 kcal mol21 for HCl and 19.86, 41.59,
and 28.99 kcal mol21 for the radical product. After subtract-
ing the harmonic ZPE from the HCl ~4.18 kcal mol21! and
CH3 (19.52 kcal mol21), only 4% of the available energy for
the Cl1methane reaction goes into HCl internal energy and
4% into radical internal energy. For the other two reactions,
the radical internal energy fraction is larger. A small number
of trajectories deposit energies less than the zero-point en-
ergy into internal motion because of the use of classical me-
chanics. Detailed information about the partitioning of avail-
able energy into HCl rotational and vibrational energy, total
translational energy and internal energy of the radical for all
three reactions can be found in Table IV.

tributions of the radical fragments are shown in Fig. 5, with
an analysis that rejects the trajectories resulting in highly
rotationally excited HCl, as described earlier. The C2H5 and
CH2OH radical rotational distributions have Gaussian-type
shapes with respective average values of J8525 and 36 and
full widths at half-maximum of 19 and 17 units of J8. These
correspond, respectively, to average rotational energies of
;1.8 and 3.9 kcal mol21. In addition to the calculated prod-
uct rotational distributions and energy partitioning, vector
correlations between the product velocities and rotational an-
gular momenta have been computed. For all three reactions,
the distributions peak at 90° angles between vHCl and JHCl
8
,
and are very broad, with respective FWHM of 54°, 56°, and
75° for the methane, ethane, and methanol reactions. Rakitzis
et al.43 measured the rotational alignment of DCl(v850,
J851) from the reactions of Cl atoms with CD4 and C2D6
and explained the results in terms of preferential angular mo-
mentum polarization perpendicular to the DCl recoil velocity
direction (Cl1CD4) and the Cl to C atom line of centers
(Cl1C2D6). The different reference directions were argued
to arise from the relatively late and early transition states for
the two reactions. Our calculations are not directly compa-
rable because trajectories are initiated only from low impact
parameter geometries ~with respect to the Cl–H–C part of
the transition state!, but the line of centers and the HCl rela-
tive velocity vectors coincide to within 20° so results are in
reasonable agreement with experiments. The DCl from reac-
tion of Cl with C2D6 was experimentally measured to be
only half-maximally aligned, and thus exhibits a consider-
able spread of angular momentum vector angles about the
perpendicular to the reference axis, consistent with calcula-
tions.
It is interesting to note that while the distribution of
angles between vR and JR
8 for R5CH3 has the same broad
form centered at 90° as for the correlation between vHCl and
JHCl
8
, the angular distributions for R5C2H5 and CH2OH are
sharply peaked about 90°, with FWHMs of 12° in both cases.
Reasons for this difference are discussed in Sec. IV D. The
distribution of angles between JHCl
8
and JR
8 in all three reac-
tions is broad ~ranging all the way from 0° to 180°! with
peaks at angles around 145° and the majority of angles in
regions of width 630° around the maxima.
From the fraction of the available energy deposited into
HCl vibrational energy, we conclude that, in all three studied
reactions, the nascent HCl products are only very slightly
vibrationally excited, in agreement with experimental obser-
vations. Kandel et al.6 estimated that ;0.3% of the HCl from
the reaction of Cl atoms with ethane was formed in v851,
and Smith et al.44 measured this fraction to be 1262% for
the reaction of Cl atoms with methanol under thermal con-
ditions at 295 K.

corresponding to the forward reaction coordinate to ensure
an average energy available to the products that is very simi-
lar to the HF level calculations. This kinetic energy corre-
sponds to the difference between the sum of the mean ex-
perimental collision energy ~5.60 kcal mol21! and reaction
exothermicity at the G2//MP2/6-311G(d,p) level, and the
reverse energy barrier at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of
theory, with inclusion of all ZPEs. The effect of sampling of
the initial conditions from the zero-point motions of the TS
was to reduce the mean energy available to the products to
8.27 kcal mol21. Of the 270 trajectories, 219 reached sepa-
rated products, with 42 recrossing the transition state and
separating towards reagents and only nine becoming trapped
in the shallow well in the exit valley. The rotational distribu-
tion of the HCl products calculated at the MP2/6-311G(d,p)
level is shown in Fig. 2~c! alongside the HF/6-31G results
and the experimentally determined HCl(v850) rotational
distribution. The distribution is not smooth because of the
relatively small number of trajectories computed because of
constraints of computational expense. A single trajectory
launched with 5.81 kcal mol21 of energy along the direction
of the reaction coordinate, and without ZPE in any vibra-
tional modes, resulted in an HCl product with J853.0 at this
level of theory. Upon sampling a range of initial conditions
incorporating ZPE effects, the MP2/6-311G(d,p) trajectory
propagations led to a rotational distribution that is, on aver-
age, less rotationally excited than was computed at the HF/
6-31G level of theory: the mean rotational energies for the
distributions truncated at J8511 are, respectively, 347 and
400
cm21
~0.99
and
1.14
kcal mol21!.
The
MP2/
6-311G(d,p) results are in better agreement with experi-
mental observations of a mean HCl rotational energy of
330629
cm21.1
On
average,
2.87,
5.70,
and
28.23
kcal mol21 of available energy were channeled, respectively,
into the total translational energy of the products, the HCl
rotation and vibration, and the CH2OH radical internal en-
ergy. After subtraction of the ZPE of the HCl ~4.41
kcal mol21! and CH2OH (24.11 kcal mol21), of the 8.27
kcal mol21 of available energy, 35% is transferred on aver-
age into total translational energy of the products, 50% be-
comes internal energy of the radical, and the remaining 16%
goes into internal ~rotational and vibrational! energy of the
HCl. Full details of the energy partitioning are listed in Table
IV, with the internal energy of the HCl products separated
into vibrational and rotational parts. Figures 3~c! and 4~c!
show the distributions of total translational and internal en-
ergy of the CH2OH radical, respectively, for the reaction of
Cl
atoms
with

as
calculated
at

gular momentum quantum number distribution calculated at
this level is shown in Fig. 5~c! alongside the HF/6-31G re-
sults.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. Cl¿CH4\HCl¿CH3
The rotational distribution calculated at the HF/6-31G
level of theory for the HCl products from the reaction of
Cl1CH4 agrees well with the outcomes of reduced dimen-
sionality QCT calculations performed by Troya et al.20
which peak at J851, 2 and drop to close to zero by J855.
Bowman and co-workers19 calculated a slightly hotter HCl
rotational distribution, peaking at J852 for total energies
below 7.26 kcal mol21. All these theoretical results predict
rotational distributions with greater excitation than is found
experimentally—for example, the results of Varley et al.4
show a distribution that peaks at J851 and extends only up
to J854, while that of Simpson et al.5 is colder still ~recent,
unpublished measurements from our laboratory coincide
closely with the results from Ref. 4!. Although the disagree-
ment with experiment is not severe ~particularly with the
data of Varley et al.4!, it is noteworthy that the trajectory
calculations predict a hotter rotational distribution, with a tail
extending to very high rotational levels. This outcome is all
the more surprising given the initial conditions used, which
are intended to mimic reaction occurring through the nonro-
tating, zero-point level of the transition state. The C3v sym-
metry of the saddle-point and the A1 irreducible representa-
tion to which the reaction coordinate belongs mean that
trajectories started at the TS along the reaction coordinate,
with no excitation of orthogonal modes, should give com-
pletely nonrotating HCl, and this is indeed what is observed.
Given that the zero-point level should have no angular mo-
mentum, and the absence of orbital angular momentum, our
calculations might therefore be expected to give a cooler
rotational distribution. It should, however, be noted that, ex-
cept for the tail at high energies, very similar results to ours
are obtained in the recent reduced-dimensionality trajectory
study of Troya et al.,20 in which full reactive collisions are
modeled, starting from reactants and including the whole
range of impact parameters.
Among other possible sources of error, it is possible that
the exaggerated barrier height on our HF potential energy
surface contributes to the slightly hotter J8 distribution than
is experimentally measured. Computational restrictions pre-
vented us, however, from considering a more accurate level
of ab initio theory. The presence of wings in the Wigner
distribution with both high displacement from the equilib-
rium geometry and high momentum may also explain the
occurrence of some trajectories with very high J8 values.
Finally, we note that it is possible that a quantum interfer-
ence effect might make the rotational distribution slightly
cooler: as the system leaves the TS to enter the product re-
gion, bending vibrations at the TS map onto rotations of the
products. In the classical trajectories, initial conditions
sampled on either ‘‘side’’ of a given bending vibration lead
to HCl and CH3 products rotating in opposite directions. A
corresponding quantum wavepacket might instead lead
mainly to nonrotating products. Proving that such effects oc-
cur would however require a more accurate treatment of the
classical trajectories, both in terms of potential energy sur-
faces and initial sampling.
The rotational state distribution of the accompanying
CH3 fragments is also cold, as depicted in Fig. 5, peaking at
J852 from where it gradually decreases as far as J858, and
extends with a weak tail up to J8512. These results are in
agreement with quantum dynamics calculations of Yu and
Nyman,17 which gave a cold CH3 rotational distribution

peaking at J851 and extending only as far as J854. The
data presented in Table IV demonstrate that most of the
available energy ~92%! is channeled into HCl and CH3 trans-
lation, with only 4% becoming CH3 radical internal energy
and 3% vibrational excitation of the HCl. Our calculations
thus disagree in this regard with the QCT calculations of
Troya et al.:20 although both the on-the-ﬂy and the quasi-
classical trajectories predict low HCl rotation ~2% of the
available energy in the QCT case!, the QCT calculations re-
sult in the rest of the energy being almost equally shared
between translation ~51%! and HCl vibration ~47%!. Under
the experimental conditions of Simpson et al.,5 vibrationally
excited HCl products were energetically inaccessible. Trajec-
tory animations conﬁrm that the CH3 radical in this reaction
exerts little inﬂuence on the departing HCl product and ab-
sorbs only a small fraction of the available energy.
B. Cl¿C2H6\HCl¿C2H5
As is observed for the reaction of Cl atoms with meth-
ane, our on-the-ﬂy trajectory calculations for reaction of Cl
atoms with ethane predict slightly hotter HCl rotational dis-
tributions than are observed experimentally.1,2,6 Of the 7.70
kcal mol21 of available energy, 78% evolves into product
translation, with 21% channeled into C2H5 radical internal
energy. This fraction of available energy in radical internal
energy is larger than was deduced from experiments by Zare
and co-workers6 ~7%!, but is in excellent agreement with a
more detailed analysis of new data obtained by Bass et al.22
Animations of selected trajectories, as well as the calculated
extent of HCl rotational excitation, demonstrate that the ethyl
radical does not have a substantial inﬂuence on the newly
forming HCl product during the hydrogen abstraction reac-
tion, although it does absorb a substantial fraction of the
available energy, and thus cannot be construed as a spectator.
The negative value of 23% obtained for the amount of avail-
able energy partitioned into HCl vibrational energy is not
classically unphysical, but rather means that the computed
vibrational energy is marginally less than the quantum me-
chanical ZPE associated with the HCl molecule. Ferna
´ndez-
Ramos et al.45 recently reported QCT calculations for the
reaction of Cl atoms with ethane on a reduced dimensionality
~2-D, rC–H , rH–Cl) parametrized PES constructed from ab
initio calculations, but calculated only HCl velocity distribu-
tions
and
found
good
agreement
with
experimental
results.6,21
Suits and co-workers46 proposed a model to account for
the large internal energy observed in alkyl radical products of
the reactions of O(3P) atoms with a variety of alkanes, in
which sudden loss of an H atom projects the geometry of the
alkane onto the alkyl radical. Large changes in geometry thus
give rise to signiﬁcant internal excitation of the radical. The
model was suggested to be applicable to reactions of Cl at-
oms with alkanes and alcohols—an assertion that can be
tested here. For the ethyl radical the most important geom-
etry change is the relaxation from a pyramidal to near-planar
arrangement around the C atom from which the H atom is
abstracted accompanied by the slight shortening of the bonds
to the adjacent atoms. The dihedral angle between the re-
maining H atoms and the C–C backbone increases from
122.03° to 166.02°, while the C–H and C–C bond lengths
decrease from 1.0934 to 1.0824 Å and from 1.5286 to 1.4934
Å, respectively. Calculations at the G2//MP2/6-311G(d,p)
level, neglecting the ZPE, show the relaxation energy of the
ethyl radical to be 6.66 kcal mol21. This signiﬁcantly over-
estimates the amount of internal excitation of the ethyl radi-
cal predicted in our trajectories ~1.65 kcal mol21! and would,
in fact, account for the majority of the available energy for
this mildly exothermic reaction. Indeed, for our effectively
low impact parameter trajectories, the bulk of the ethyl inter-
nal energy can be accounted for by rotation. In the limit that
K50, the total energy in ethyl rotation calculated from the
radical product state distribution shown in Fig. 5~b! is 1.59
kcal mol21, or 96% of the ethyl internal energy. The model
of Suits and co-workers is thus judged to be inappropriate for
this H-atom abstraction reaction.
The low rotational angular momentum of the HCl has
been attributed to the near-linear Cl–H–C group in the TS,
and to nonimpulsive release of energy on the products’ side
of the PES.6 We also note that the computed dipole moment
of the C2H5 radical ~0.25 D from HF/6-31G calculations! is
sufﬁciently small that substantial torques are not generated
by the interaction of the dipoles of the HCl and C2H5 as they
separate. The rotational angular momentum of the C2H5 ,
however, is much larger because of the torque applied about
the center of mass of the radical by the abstraction of the H
atom.
C. Cl¿CH3OH\HCl¿CH2OH
The rotational distribution of HCl products from the Cl
atom reaction with methanol, calculated at the HF/6-31G
level of theory, is more excited than is experimentally
observed.1,2 ^Erot& values from HF/6-31G trajectories and ex-
perimental measurements are, respectively, 400 and 330629
cm21. This trend is the same as with the results for Cl atom
reactions with methane and ethane, but the HCl from the
methanol reaction is calculated to be signiﬁcantly more rota-
tionally excited than that from the alkane reactions at the
same level of theory. In addition to 13% of the available
energy being channeled into the HCl rotation, and 42% into
product translational energy, 46% is directed into CH2OH
internal energy. The prediction for product translation is in
good agreement with the experimental results of Ahmed
et al.,24 and recent data from Kitsopoulos and co-workers.25
In the former experiments, conducted at a collision energy of
Ecoll58.7 kcal mol21, the average fraction of the available
energy going to product translation was 39%. In the latter
experiments, this fraction was 40% at a mean collision en-
ergy of 5.6 kcal mol21. The fraction of the available energy
deposited into internal energy of the CH2OH radical is sig-
niﬁcantly higher than is the case for CH3 or C2H5 reaction
products.
Again
following
the
model
of
Suits
and
co-workers,46 relaxation of the hydroxymethyl radical to its
equilibrium conﬁguration primarily involves a change in the
C atom conﬁguration to a more planar arrangement. The di-
hedral angle between the remaining H atoms and the C–O
bond opens from 121.24° to 146.21°, accompanied with

shortening of the C–H and C–O bonds similar to that found
in the ethyl radical. There is also a signiﬁcant torsion about
the C–O bond, which decreases the HCOH dihedral angle
from 61.52° to 28.75°. The relaxation energy of these geom-
etry changes is calculated at the G2/MP2/6-311G(d,p) level
to be 5.57 kcal mol21, again neglecting ZPE. As in the case
of the ethyl radical, the relaxation energy is greater than the
fraction of the available energy predicted to be partitioned
into internal excitation of the hydroxymethyl in the trajectory
calculations ~4.07 kcal mol21!. Based on the radical rota-
tional state distribution calculated in the HF/6-31G level tra-
jectories, and assuming that K50, the rotational energy
again accounts for 98% of the hydroxymethyl internal exci-
tation.
The much greater rotational excitation of the HCl prod-
ucts for the alcohol reaction was postulated to be a conse-
quence of dipole-dipole interactions between the newly
formed HCl and CH2OH fragments as they separate,1,2
which is largely absent for the reactions of Cl atoms with
methane and ethane. Table V shows the computed dipole
moments of reagents, products, and the transition states, both
as a whole and in terms of the constituent parts into which
the TSs ﬁnally fragment, obtained at both HF/6-31G and
MP2/6-311G(d,p) levels of theory. The CH2OH radical has
a far larger dipole moment than the CH3 or C2H5 radicals.
The on-the-ﬂy trajectory calculations for the Cl1CH3OH
system, calculated at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level, resulted
in colder HCl rotational distribution than calculations at the
HF/6-31G level, and the mean rotational energy is also
smaller. This outcome can be rationalized in terms of the
values of the computed HCl and CH2OH dipole moments,
which are ;25% smaller from the MP2/6-311G(d,p) calcu-
lations than from those derived from HF/6-31G calculations.
The energies of the various dipole-dipole interactions, and
thus the asymptotic degree of rotational excitation, will be
proportional to the products of the dipole moments of the
HCl and CH2OH. The ratio of the products of the HCl and
CH2OH dipole moments computed at the HF/6-31G and
MP2/6-311G(d,p) levels of theory is 1.7. Assuming that the
experimental value of the dipole moment of CH2OH is not
too different from the MP2/6-311G(d,p) value of 1.55 D,
the equivalent ratio of the products of the HF/6-31G and
experimental dipole moments ~with an HCl dipole moment
of 1.1086 D!47 is 2.2. These ratios compare very favorably
with the corresponding ratios of rotational energies for the
centers of the distributions obtained from calculations and
measurements. The HCl rotational distributions are centered
at
J856
~HF/6-31G
calculations!,
J854.5 (MP2/6-
311G(d,p) calculations! and J854 ~experimental measure-
ments!, and the associated rotational energies, which are pro-
portional to J8(J811), take values for the same ratios of 1.7
and 2.1.
D. Factors determining radical and HCl rotation
The extent of radical rotational excitation and the corre-
lations between angular momentum and velocity vectors can
be understood in terms of the mechanisms for generation of
rotational angular momentum of the polyatomic products.
For the reactions of Cl atoms with CH3CH3 and CH3OH,
even a collinear Cl–H–C arrangement in the TS will induce
a torque about the center of mass of the CH2CH3 or CH2OH
as the H atom is transferred. This torque will generate a
substantial angular momentum of the radical product that is
perpendicular to the plane of the recoil velocity vectors, and
the associated rotation accounts for most of the internal en-
ergy carried by the radical fragment. The torque may be
shifted from its mean value by bending motion of the
Cl–H–C group of atoms. The rotational angular momentum
may be further inﬂuenced by dipole-dipole interactions be-
tween the fragments, as discussed earlier, perhaps causing
some reorientation of the angular momentum vectors of the
products of the Cl1CH3OH reaction. For the C3v symmetry
Cl–H–CH3 TS, however, the CH3 center of mass is located
on the C3 axis, so there is no torque generated unless there is
zero-point bending motion of the TS. Any such bending will
map directly into the ~much smaller! CH3 rotational excita-
tion, as well as HCl rotation and the orbital angular momen-
tum of the products.
As noted in Sec. III B, the distribution of angles between
vR and JR for R5CH3 is centered at 90° but is very broad.
Examination of sample trajectories resulting in nearly paral-
lel vR and JR vectors shows no obvious cause for this unex-
pected correlation, but is likely to be a consequence of the
angular momentum within the TS associated with the starting
conditions of the trajectories, perhaps compounded by zero-
point motion that displaces the central H atom away from the
sv symmetry planes of the transition state, thereby inducing
a torsional motion. This distortion would generate compo-
nents of counter-rotation of the CH3 and HCl products in the
plane perpendicular to the C3 axis, but with no overall he-
licity. Either effect will be most evident for the Cl1CH4
reaction because it has the smallest components of angular
momentum of the product radical in orthogonal directions,
i.e., those in a plane perpendicular to the recoil direction.

Equivalent effects in the reactions of Cl atoms with ethane
and methanol are not easily discerned in the product radical
angular momentum alignment because of the dominant effect
of the torque about the radical center of mass.
There are no strong kinematic constraints on the rota-
tional and orbital angular momenta of the reactions of Cl
atoms with ethane and methanol, despite the mass combina-
tion involving transfer of a light atom between two heavy
partners. The rotational angular momenta of the C2H6 and
CH3OH reagents are, on average, approximately J55 for
experiments at 60 K and J59 for studies at 200 K, and are
likely to be smaller than the reagent orbital angular momenta
because of the high relative velocities for collisions. The
product radicals are, however, calculated to have rotational
angular momentum quantum numbers in excess of 20 that
will be oriented almost opposite to the product orbital angu-
lar momenta. The kinematic constraints associated with
H1LH reactions ~H5heavy and L5light atom!, that require
near-conservation of orbital angular momentum, are thus re-
laxed here because of the rotational degrees of freedom of
the polyatomic product.
From the above discussion, we can make several deduc-
tions about the factors that control the extent of rotational
excitation of the HCl products of the three reactions studied.
In all three reactions, the Cl–H–C group in the TS is calcu-
lated to have a near-linear or collinear minimum energy ge-
ometry. The transition states are, however, subject to distor-
tion from this geometry because of bending vibrations, even
in the zero point level. Our calculations suggest that this
bending of the Cl–H–C group strongly inﬂuences the width
of the HCl rotational distribution. Trajectories run at the HF/
6-31G level without any ZPE in the vibrational modes of the
TS that have components of Cl–H–C bending gave HCl
product rotational distributions which peaked sharply at the
same values of J8 as were obtained from single trajectories
launched from the ﬁxed minimum energy geometry of the
TS, with kinetic energy only along the reaction coordinate.
With incorporation of ZPE in these bending modes, the HCl
rotational distributions broadened, and, for the Cl1alkane
reactions, shifted their mean values upwards by 1 to 2 units
of J8. Larger dipole moments on the products appear to have
a much greater effect on the mean rotational excitation of the
HCl. Single trajectories from a TS with collinear Cl–H–C
and no ZPE in vibration gave much more rotationally excited
HCl products for the reaction of Cl atoms with methanol
(J857 for HF/6-31G or J853 for MP2/6-311G(d,p) calcu-
lations! than with the alkanes (J850).
V. CONCLUSIONS
A total of 2000 trajectories were calculated for each of
the three reactions of Cl atoms with CH4 , C2H6, and
CH3OH, using direct ab initio ~‘‘on-the-ﬂy’’! molecular dy-
namics methods, and potentials from HF/6-31G calculations,
with sampling of initial conditions from the zero-point mo-
tions of the transition states. The trajectories were initiated at
the TS for each reaction, allowing investigation of the effects
of the exit channel potential energy surface on the product
energies and reaction dynamics. The HF/6-31G level calcu-
lations gave rotational quantum state population distributions
of the HCl products that were 1–2 units of J8 hotter than
experimental measurements, but correctly described the rela-
tive degrees of rotational excitation of HCl products from the
three reactions. The CH3 and C2H5 radicals are calculated to
absorb 4% and 21% of the available energy in their internal
modes. The hydroxymethyl radical not only acquires, on av-
erage, 46% of the total available energy as internal excita-
tion, but also exerts substantial inﬂuence on the rotational
motion of the reaction products via a strong dipole-dipole
interaction with the departing HCl cofragment. Most of the
radical internal energy can be accounted for by rotational
motion. There were also 270 trajectories calculated on-the-
ﬂy at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of theory for the reaction
of Cl atoms with methanol, and the 219 that reached prod-
ucts gave an HCl rotational distribution that is in better
agreement with experiment ~with respective mean values of
the HCl rotational energy of 347 and 330 cm21!. The distri-
bution is colder than that obtained at the HF/6-31G level of
theory, and the enhanced rotation calculated from the HF/6-
31G trajectories is attributed to the larger computed values of
the HCl and CH2OH dipole moments. The HF/6-31G calcu-
lations predict that 92%, 78%, and 42% of the available en-
ergy is channeled into total translational energy of the HCl
and, respectively, CH3 , C2H5, and CH2OH products. Thus,
without recourse to reduced-dimensionality approximations,
or the need for a global PES, we have calculated direct tra-
jectory calculations at both the HF/6-31G and MP2/6-
311G(d,p) levels of theory that are generally in very good
agreement with the available experimental observations. As
well as providing good quantitative agreement with experi-
mental data, the results highlight the key qualitative features
of the reaction dynamics of these large molecular systems.
By initiating the trajectories at geometries close to the mini-
mum energy transition state, however, we have not incorpo-
rated the effects of large impact parameter collisions ~relative
to the C–H bond attacked! and thus cannot yet derive differ-
ential cross sections.
