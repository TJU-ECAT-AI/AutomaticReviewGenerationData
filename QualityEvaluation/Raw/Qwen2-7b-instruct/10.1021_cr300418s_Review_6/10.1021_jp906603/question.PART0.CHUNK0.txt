Anthony GoodrowAlexis T. Bell*Martin Head-Gordon* View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract The rate of spin-surface crossing from the singlet to the triplet potential energy surface during methanol oxidation has been examined for classically spin-forbidden crossings. The LandauZener equation has been used to calculate the thermally-averaged spin transition probabilities for the nonadiabatic surface crossing reaction. Two active sites have been investigated: isolated vanadate species supported on silica (VOx/SiO2) and titania (VOx/TiO2). The results show that the rate of spin-surface crossing is much faster than the rate-limiting H-abstraction step on both active sites and is therefore not kinetically relevant.

In the analysis of many catalytic mechanisms, the details of nonadiabatic reactions have been largely ignored and have thus been assumed to either occur rapidly (1-3) or be spin-forbidden. (4) An example of a nonadiabatic reaction is the rate-limiting step of H-abstraction in the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde on isolated vanadate sites supported on silica (VOx/SiO2) and titania (VOx/TiO2). The reactant species on both supported metal oxides consists of an isolated VOx species with adsorbed methanol, forming a H3COVO/MOH (M = Si, Ti) pair. (1-3, 5, 6) The most energetically stable electronic state for the reactant is the singlet spin state (M = 1) with V containing zero unpaired d electrons. (1-3) During the H-abstraction step, one of the three adsorbed methoxy H atoms is transferred to the vanadyl O to form a H2COVOH group in the product species. (1-3, 5, 6) The transition state and product species are in the triplet electronic state (M = 3) with V containing two unpaired d electrons. (1-3) In previous studies, (1-3) the broken symmetry approach (7, 8) was used to calculate the activation energy of the transition state, thereby accounting for the change in spin state; however, these studies did not consider the probability that such a classically spin-forbidden transition occurs. The crossing from one potential energy surface to another has also recently been shown to play a role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on VOx supported on TiO2 and Al2O3. (9) In the present work, the probabilities and rate constants have been calculated for crossing from the singlet to the triplet potential energy surface during the rate-limiting step in methanol oxidation catalyzed on VOx/SiO2 and VOx/TiO2. This study examines whether classically spin-forbidden transitions are a bottleneck in methanol oxidation.
Theoretical Methods The LandauZener formula, (10-15) eq 1, has been used to calculate the thermally-averaged spin transition probabilities, PLZ, between two different electronic states. In eq 1, H12 is the spinorbit coupling energy between the two states, and E1 and E2 are the mass-weighted gradients of the two potential energy surfaces at the point of crossing. Equation 1 is integrated over v, the mass-weighted velocity of the system, (13) and evaluated using numerical integration. Alternatively, eq 1 can be integrated over the reaction coordinate velocity, where E1  E2 is replaced with at the point of crossing.
(1) The LandauZener model has been successfully applied to a number of nonadiabatic systems involving excited species and near-resonant electronic-energy-transfer reactions, such as those involved in the chemical oxygeniodine laser. (16) The classical trajectory method (14) can be used when a more exact treatment of electronically nonadiabatic processes is desired.
There are two traversals of the avoided crossing region during a nonadiabatic reaction that lead to the product species being on a different potential energy surface than the reactant species. One traversal involves crossing in the forward direction with a probability of PLZ, and the second traversal involves crossing in the reverse direction with a probability of PLZ·(1  PLZ). (14) The spin transmission coefficient, κLZ, represents the net transition probability for spin-forbidden transitions and is analogous to the quantum tunneling probability. (14) The parameter κLZ is defined in eq 2 as the sum of the two probabilities for crossing in the forward and reverse directions.
(2) The rate constant for spin-surface crossing is equal to PLZ multiplied by an Arrhenius expression and is given in eq 3. The factor PLZ is used instead of κLZ because no recrossing is assumed to occur in the reverse direction under the assumption of absolute rate theory. Since the nonadiabatic reactions considered in this work involve crossing from a singlet to a triplet potential energy surface, the ratio of the electronic partition functions in eq 3 is qelec,M=3/qelec,M=1 = 3. The translational, rotational, and vibrational partition functions were assumed to be identical for the same species with different spin states and have been omitted in eq 3, consistent with previous work. (17) Lastly, ΔEM=13 is the difference in energy between the intersection of the two potential energy surfaces and the reactant state.
(3) The spinorbit coupling energies H12 for the systems in the present study were estimated from previous work on FeO+. (18) During the oxidative activation of H2 by FeO+, Danovich and Shaik (18) calculated H12([FeO]+), which varied from 9.44 × 102 to 1.97 × 101 kcal/mol, depending on the calculation approach used. Since the spinorbit coupling energies scale with the fourth-power of the atomic number, (19)Z, the value for H12([VO]2+) was estimated from H12([FeO]+) using eq 4, and calculated to vary from 5.78 × 102 kcal/mol to 1.21 × 101 kcal/mol.
(4) All geometry optimizations and force calculations were performed using QChem 3.0 (20) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The transition metals V and Ti were treated using the LANL2DZ basis sets and effective core potentials. All singlet spin state calculations were closed-shell, and the triplet spin states showed negligible spin contamination (S2 < 0.02). The modified growing string method (GSM) was used with 11 nodes to determine an initial estimate of the transition state. (21) The hybrid strategy (21, 22) was used to determine the minimum energy pathway on the singlet potential energy surface. The modified GSM calculations were initiated at the HF/STO-3G level of theory and further refined at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The transition state estimate was further optimized by performing a transition state search calculation in QChem 3.0 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory, consisting of an initial Hessian calculation and a transition state optimization. The crossing point was determined by performing single-point energy calculations on the triplet potential energy surface using the geometries determined from the modified-GSM on the singlet potential energy surface. This approach underestimates the rate of spin-surface crossing because the intersection of the two potential energy surfaces occurs at a higher energy than if the geometries of the optimized triplet potential energy surface were used. At the point of intersection, the geometries and energies on the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces were shown to be identical. It is important to note that the BornOppenheimer approximation may not be valid at the point of intersection because the nuclei may move rapidly from the singlet to the triplet potential energy surface; however, this is not the purpose of the present study, which instead is to examine a nonadiabatic transition driven by spinorbit coupling. The SCF energy was considered converged when the energy of successive iterations differed by less than 107 hartrees. The threshold value was set to 1010 for neglecting two electron integrals. All final energies reported were determined by setting the SCF convergence to 108 and the threshold value to 1011 and by using the more refined SG-1 integration grid.Results and Discussion Methanol Oxidation on VOx/SiO2 The rate-limiting step in methanol oxidation to formaldehyde on VOx/SiO2 involves transferring one of the three H atoms from an adsorbed methoxy group to the vanadyl O atom, (1, 2) as shown in Figure 1a. As mentioned previously, the lowest-energy structure of the reactant is a singlet spin state, whereas the lowest-energy structures for the transition and product states are triplet spin states. Modified-GSM calculations were performed on the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces, and the spin-surface crossing was shown to occur before the transition state, as seen in Figure 2. The LandauZener probabilities, PLZ, were calculated using eq 1, and the values are shown in Table 1. These values are calculated for spinorbit coupling energies, H12([VO]2+), of 5.78 × 102 and 1.21 × 101 kcal/mol, and for temperatures from 450 to 750 K. The norm of the difference in the gradient at the crossing point (which occurs at a normalized arclength value of  = 0.16) between the two electronic states, E1  E2, is 165.8 kcal/mol·Å. The difference in energy between these two states, ΔEM=13, is 14.1 kcal/mol.Figure 1 Figure 1. Rate-limiting H-abstraction step in methanol oxidation on (a) VOx/SiO2 and (b) VOx/TiO2 (the O-vacancy is circled). All reaction energies (ΔE) and activation energies (ΔE) are in kcal/mol.Figure 2 Figure 2. Reaction pathway for H-abstraction on VOx/SiO2 shown for the singlet (M = 1) and triplet (M = 3) surfaces. There is a spin-surface crossing from the singlet to the triplet surface with ΔEM=13 = 14.1 kcal/mol at a normalized arclength value of  = 0.16.Table 1. Thermally-Averaged LandauZener Spin Transition Probabilities (PLZ) for H-Abstraction in VOx/SiO2 (see Figure 1a) temperature (K) PLZ, H12 = 5.78 ×102 kcal/mol PLZ, H12 = 1.21 ×101 kcal/mol 450 0.0230 0.0389 550 0.0216 0.0368 650 0.0203 0.0347 750 0.0189 0.0327 The maximum rate of formaldehyde production on VOx/SiO2 occurs at 650 K. (5) At this temperature, PLZ ranges from 2.0 to 3.5%. Using eq 3, the rate constant kM=13 at 650 K is equal to 1.49 × 107 s1 (for PLZ = 2.03%) and 2.56 × 107 s1 (for PLZ = 3.47%). Comparing kM=13 to the rate constant for the rate-limiting H-abstraction step at 650 K, krls = 7.95 × 102 s1, (2) it is concluded that the rate of spin-surface crossing is rapid and hence not rate-limiting. Alternatively, if the reaction coordinate velocity is used instead of the mass-weighted system velocity in eq 1, then the values for PLZ in Table 1 are reduced slightly and range from 1.8 to 2.5% at 650 K, but are still not small enough to be rate-limiting.Methanol Oxidation on VOx/TiO2 Similar to VOx/SiO2, the rate-limiting step in methanol oxidation on VOx/TiO2 involves H-abstraction, (3) as shown in Figure 1b. Previous work has suggested that the active site involved in this reaction contains an O-vacancy, shown in Figure 1b, which serves to reduce the activation energy by H-bond stabilization of the transition state. (3) The lowest-energy structure of the reactant was M = 1, whereas the lowest-energy structures for the transition state and product were M = 3. A plot of the reaction pathway on the M = 1 and M = 3 surfaces is similar to that seen in Figure 2 for VOx/SiO2 and shows that the spin-surface crossing also occurs before the transition state. The LandauZener probabilities, PLZ, were calculated using eq 1, and the values are shown in Table 2. The values are calculated for spinorbit coupling energies of 5.78 × 102 and 1.21 × 101 kcal/mol and for temperatures from 450 to 750 K. The norm of the difference in the gradient at the crossing point (which occurs at a normalized arclength value of  = 0.24), E1  E2, is 24.9 kcal/mol·Å, and ΔEM=13 is 21.8 kJ/mol.Table 2. Thermally-Averaged LandauZener Spin Transition Probabilities (PLZ) for H-Abstraction in VOx/TiO2 (see Figure 1b) temperature (K) PLZ, H12 = 5.78 ×102 kcal/mol PLZ, H12 = 1.21 ×101 kcal/mol 450 0.0497 0.156 550 0.0471 0.149 650 0.0446 0.142 750 0.042 0.134 The maximum rate of formaldehyde production on VOx/TiO2 occurs at 450 K. (6) At this temperature, PLZ ranges from 5.0 to 15.6%. It is interesting to note that the values of PLZ for VOx/TiO2 are about two to three times greater than those for VOx/SiO2 at the same temperature. Using eq 3, the rate constant kM=13 at 450 K is equal to 3.60 × 101 s1 (for PLZ = 4.97%) and 1.13 × 102 s1 (for PLZ = 15.6%). Comparing kM=13 to the rate constant for the rate-limiting H-abstraction step at 450 K for 1% surface O-vacancies, krls = 1.46 × 104 s1, (3) it is concluded that here too the rate of spin-surface crossing is rapid and hence not rate-limiting. Alternatively, if the reaction coordinate velocity is used instead of the mass-weighted system velocity in eq 1, then the values for PLZ in Table 2 are reduced and range only from 2.1 to 3.0% at 450 K, but are still not small enough to be rate-limiting.Conclusions A spin-surface crossing from the singlet to the triplet potential energy surface occurs during methanol oxidation on VOx/SiO2 and VOx/TiO2. Classically, the transition from M = 1  3 is spin-forbidden as the spin state must be preserved from reactant to product. The LandauZener model has been used to determine the spin transmission coefficient (using the mass-weighted system velocity or the reaction coordinate velocity) and a lower estimate of the rate constant for nonadiabatic spin-surface crossing processes. In the reaction considered, the ratio of the rate constant for spin-surface crossing, kM=13, to the rate constant for the rate-limiting step, krls, is on the order of 108 for VOx/SiO2 and 105 for VOx/TiO2. The spin-surface crossing was also shown to occur well before the transition state. Thus, even though surface crossing reactions are classically spin-forbidden, they are still important in catalytic mechanisms, especially in the present example in which the rate of crossing is not kinetically-limiting.Author Information Corresponding Authors Alexis T.
