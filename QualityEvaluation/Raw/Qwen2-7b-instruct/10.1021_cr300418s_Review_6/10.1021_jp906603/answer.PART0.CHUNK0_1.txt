[1] "In the analysis of many catalytic mechanisms, the details of nonadiabatic reactions have been largely ignored and have thus been assumed to either occur rapidly (1-3) or be spin-forbidden."
[2] "The results show that the rate of spin-surface crossing is much faster than the rate-limiting H-abstraction step on both active sites and is therefore not kinetically relevant."
[3] "The maximum rate of formaldehyde production on VOx/SiO2 occurs at 650 K. (5) At this temperature, PLZ ranges from 2.0 to 3.5%."
[4] "The maximum rate of formaldehyde production on VOx/TiO2 occurs at 450 K. (6) At this temperature, PLZ ranges from 5.0 to 15.6%."
[5] "The spin-surface crossing was also shown to occur well before the transition state."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the nonadiabatic reactions that occur during these processes. These methods allow for the calculation of thermally-averaged spin transition probabilities, which can help in determining the rates of spin-surface crossing. The results indicate that the rate of spin-surface crossing is much faster than the rate-limiting steps in methanol oxidation on both VOx/SiO2 and VOx/TiO2 catalysts. This finding suggests that nonadiabatic spin-surface crossing is not a kinetic bottleneck in these reactions, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in alkane activation on these catalysts.

这些计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过提供关于非绝热反应的见解，增强了我们预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活过程中催化活性的能力。这些方法允许计算热平均自旋转换概率，这有助于确定自旋表面穿越的速率。结果表明，在VOx/SiO2和VOx/TiO2催化剂上进行甲醇氧化的速率远快于限制步骤。这一发现表明，非绝热自旋表面穿越不是这些反应的热瓶颈，对理解烷烃在这些催化剂上的激活机制提供了更好的理解。
