Density-Functional Theory with Screened van der Waals Interactions for the Modeling of Hybrid Inorganic-Organic Systems Victor G. Ruiz,1 Wei Liu,1 Egbert Zojer,2 Matthias Scheffler,1 and Alexandre Tkatchenko1 

The reliable prediction of the equilibrium structure and dynamic properties of HIOS from first principles represent a great challenge to the state-of-the-art theoretical methods due to the interplay of covalent interactions, electron transfer processes, van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and Pauli repulsion. In particular, vdW interactions are fundamental in determining the structure and stability of organic molecules on solid surfaces [511].

In this Letter, we propose a method that extends standard pairwise vdW corrections [17,18] to the modeling of adsorbates on surfaces. Here, this is achieved by combin- ing the DFT  vdW scheme [18] with the Lifshitz- Zaremba-Kohn (LZK) theory for the vdW interaction between an atom and a solid surface [20,21].

Beyond the region of orbital overlap, the vdW interaction of an atom a with a solid B is given by EvdW CaB 3 =Z  Z03, where Z is the distance from the vdW image plane Z0, and the CaB 3 is the corresponding vdW interaction coefficient [2022]. 

A convenient approach to recover the LZK formula [22,23], is to determine the vdW interaction of an atom a with a solid B by a summation of Cab

ab pair potentials between the atom a and the atoms b in the infinite half- space of the solid B. In this case, the image-plane position is given as Z0  d=2, where d is the interlayer distance, and the CaB 3 coefficient is obtained as CaB 3 ns

The next step is to disentangle the heteronuclear Cab 6;LZK interaction coefficient into homonuclear Caa 6 and Cbb 6;LZK coefficients.

For this purpose, we adopt a Pade -approximant model for the atomic polarizability as in the DFT  vdW method [18]. The Pade -approximant model allows us to perform analytic frequency integration, leading to a simple combination rule for Cab

The a 0 and b LZK correspond to the adsorbate atom and the effective atom-in-a-solid static polarizabilities, respectively.

The LZK theory is exact for atom-surface distances beyond orbital overlap. However, it does not include effects due to rapid spatial variations (interface polariza- tion) in the dielectric function close to the surface.

To further benchmark the DFT  vdWsurf approach, we next calculated the binding energy curves for a rigid PTCDA molecule on Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces.

The data for PTCDA on Ag(111) from Fig. 1 is also included for the sake of comparison.

The equilibrium distances agree very well with the NIXSW results and also the adsorption energies reproduce the trend in the binding strength inferred from experiment: EadsCu > EadsAg > EadsAu [4].

In order to test the applicability of the DFT  vdWsurf method to systems other than PTCDA/Me(111), we calculated the relaxed geometry for Xe and benzene on a variety of metallic surfaces.

Also for these systems, the DFT vdWsurf approach leads to a good agreement in the adsorption distances and interaction energies compared to available data as shown in Table II.

The adsorption distance of the C backbone after relaxation agrees remarkably well with the experimental data to better than 0.1 A for Cu(111) and Ag(111), while an underestimation of  0:1 A is observed for Au(111).

In summary, we have combined the DFT  vdW method with the Lifshitz-Zaremba-Kohn theory, leading to a promising method (DFT  vdWsurf) that can accu- rately describe the structure and energetics of HIOS.

To answer the first question, computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by enabling detailed simulations of the complex interactions involved. Key considerations for these approaches include achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, exploring the vast space of possible materials, and understanding the specific mechanisms driving the catalytic activity. Challenges include dealing with the inherent complexity of surface chemistry, accurately modeling the interactions between reactants, catalysts, and products, and predicting how changes in the catalyst composition affect the reaction pathways. Potential benefits include the ability to screen large libraries of materials virtually, guiding the synthesis of new catalysts, and providing insights into the underlying science that can inform the design of more efficient catalysts.

For the second question, the key considerations in using DFT and cluster models for the study of hybrid inorganic-organic systems (HIOS) are the interplay of covalent interactions, electron transfer processes, van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and Pauli repulsion. vdW interactions are particularly important in determining the structure and stability of organic molecules on solid surfaces. The proposed method combines DFT vdW with the Lifshitz-Zaremba-Kohn (LZK) theory to extend standard pairwise vdW corrections to the modeling of adsorbates on surfaces. This method enhances accuracy by including many-body collective responses of substrate electrons and accounting for interface polarization effects through the use of semilocal hybridization in the DFT vdW method. The benchmarks provided in the literature demonstrate the method's ability to accurately predict equilibrium structures and energies for various HIOS, such as PTCDA on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111), as well as xenon and benzene adsorbed on metal surfaces, thus validating its effectiveness for studying the electronic properties and functions of HIOS.

对于第一个问题，计算方法如密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型显著提高了我们预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活中的催化活性的能力。关键考虑因素包括在准确性与计算效率之间取得平衡，探索可能材料的巨大空间，以及了解驱动催化活性的具体机制。挑战包括处理表面化学的固有复杂性，准确模拟反应物、催化剂和产物之间的相互作用，并预测催化剂组成的变化如何影响反应途径。潜在的好处包括能够虚拟筛选大量材料，指导新催化剂的合成，并提供关于底层科学的见解，这些科学可以指导设计更高效的催化剂。

对于第二个问题，在使用DFT和簇模型研究混合无机有机系统（HIOS）时的关键考虑因素是共价相互作用、电子转移过程、范德华（vdW）相互作用和泡利排斥的交互作用。vdW相互作用特别重要，决定了有机分子在固体表面的结构和稳定性。提出的结合方法将DFT vdW与Lifshitz-Zaremba-Kohn（LZK）理论扩展到表面吸附剂的建模中，以增强准确性，通过在DFT vdW方法中包含子集集体响应的电子并考虑到界面极化效应来实现这一点。通过使用DFT vdW方法中的局部半局域化杂化来有效包含界面极化效应。文献中提供的基准测试证明了该方法能够准确预测各种HIOS（例如，PTCDA在Cu(111)、Ag(111)和Au(111)上的吸附）以及金属表面上的氙和苯的吸附距离和相互作用能量，从而验证了其用于研究HIOS的电子特性和功能的有效性。
