[1] "The electronic properties and the function of hybrid inorganic-organic systems (HIOS) are intimately linked to their interface geometry."
[2] "Within the possible variety of HIOS, 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (C24O6H8, PTCDA) on coinage metals is one of the best experimentally and theoretically characterized systems."
[3] "The adsorption geometry of PTCDA on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111),has been accurately determined by means of the normal incidence x-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique."
[4] "The reliable prediction of the equilibrium structure and dynamic properties of HIOS from first principles represent a great challenge to the state-of-the-art theoretical methods due to the interplay of covalent interactions, electron transfer processes, van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and Pauli repulsion."
[5] "The adsorption energy Eads as a function of vertical distance d for PTCDA on Ag(111) employing different theoretical approaches."
[6] "The estimated adsorption energy for the system (2:4 ± 0:1 eV [10]) and the experimental adsorption distance (2:86 ± 0:05 Å [4]) are indicated by shaded intervals."
[7] "Romaner et al. studied the adsorption of PTCDA on coinage metals [12], and concluded that a more accurate approach to include vdW interactions is needed."
[8] "To illustrate the problem, we start by comparing the performance of existing theoretical methods for the interaction of PTCDA with Ag(111) in Fig. 1."
[9] "The adsorption energy Eads as a function of vertical distance d for PTCDA on Ag(111) employing different theoretical approaches."
[10] "The average adsorption distance (2.86 Å) is reliably known from a number of NIXSW studies for the ordered monolayer at room temperature (see Ref. [4] and references therein)."
[11] "The inclusion of vdW interactions using the vdW-DF nonlocal functional [16] leads to far off results both for the binding distance and the binding energy."
[12] "Interatomic pair-wise PBE-D correction by Grimme [17] appears to be closer to the experimental binding distance; the calculated binding energy is, however, by 1 eV larger than the above mentioned estimate."
[13] "Even the computationally most expensive calculations using exact exchange with electron correlation treated in the random-phase approximation (with some additional approximations to make these calculations feasible) yield a 0.2 A overestimation in the equilibrium distance of PTCDA on Ag(111)."
[14] "In this Letter, we propose a method that extends standard pairwise vdW corrections [17,18] to the modeling of adsorbates on surfaces."
[15] "Here, this is achieved by combining the DFT  vdW scheme [18] with the Lifshitz- Zaremba-Kohn (LZK) theory for the vdW interaction between an atom and a solid surface [20,21]."
[16] "In our approach (DFT  vdWsurf), the vdW energy correction to the DFT total energy is given by a sum of Cab 6 R6 ab terms,where Rab are the distances between atoms a and b, in analogy to the DFT-D and DFT  vdW methods."
[17] "By employing the LZK theory, however, we include the many-body collective response (screening) of the substrate electrons in the determination of the C6 coefficients and vdW radii, going effectively beyond the pairwise description."
[18] "Interface polarization effects are accounted for via the inclusion of semilocal hybridization due to the dependence of the Cab 6 interatomic coefficients on the electron density in the DFT  vdW method."
[19] "The solid blue (light gray) line in Fig. 1 for the PTCDA/Ag(111) interface, DFT  vdWsurf indeed provides the most accurate results for the binding distance and energy when compared to all other theoretical methods."
[20] "Similarly accurate results are found for PTCDA adsorbed on other coinage metals as well as for Xe and benzene on a range of metallic surfaces."
[21] "The LZK theory is exact for atom-surface distances beyond orbital overlap."
[22] "However, it does not include effects due to rapid spatial variations (interface polarization) in the dielectric function close to the surface."
[23] "We effectively include these contributions through the linkage of the LZK theory with the DFT  vdW method."
[24] "For example,for the PTCDA molecule located at the experimental equilibrium position on Ag(111), the molecular C6;eff coefficient is increased by 9% compared to the gas-phase PTCDA, while for the surface atoms it is decreased by 4% compared to the atoms inside the bulk (C6;ref)."
[25] "As shown in Fig. 2, the equilibrium distances agree very well with the NIXSW results and also the adsorption energies reproduce the trend in the binding strength inferred from experiment: EadsCu > EadsAg > EadsAu [4]."
[26] "The position of the carboxylic oxygen (Oc) for PTCDA/Ag(111) agrees with experiment to better than 0.1 Å."
[27] "Our calculations reproduce a distortion in the Oc of 0.13 Å with respect to the C backbone due to the attraction to the surface, while the position of the anhydride oxygen (Oa) is underestimated by around 0.15 Å."
[28] "With respect to PTCDA/Cu(111), we observe that the oxygen atoms are placed at an averaged position of 2.62 Å ; i.e., they reside below the C backbone, opposite to the findings of Gerlach et al. [2]."
[29] "In addition, the Oc is located below the C backbone, while the Oa is located above it."
[30] "The DFT  vdWsurf approach has the same cost as the underlying DFT calculation, and does not depend on the nature of the surface, being equally applicable to insulators, semiconductors, and metals."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing a framework to calculate the electronic properties and interface geometries of hybrid inorganic-organic systems (HIOS). This allows for the prediction of equilibrium structures and dynamic properties, which are crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic activity. Key considerations include the interplay of covalent interactions, electron transfer processes, van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and Pauli repulsion. Challenges involve accurately predicting the binding distances and energies, especially for adsorbates on surfaces. Potential benefits include enhanced accuracy in predictions, efficiency in computational calculations, and the exploration of new catalytic materials with improved activity and selectivity.
