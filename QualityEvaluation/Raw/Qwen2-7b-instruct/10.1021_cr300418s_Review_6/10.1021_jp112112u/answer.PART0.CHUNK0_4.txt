[1] "When the (110) surface of ceria is doped with trivalent cations, the most stable defect depends on the ionic radius of the dopant."
[2] "For small ionic radius dopants, with a large mismatch to the host oxide, the structure is strongly distorted."
[3] "For Al, Sc, and In, the most stable defect is the oxygen vacancy compensating two dopants."
[4] "For Y and La, the most stable defect is MCe/ + OO• with one dopant and an oxygen hole."
[5] "It is also very interesting that, for Al, the electronic structure is typical of the classical oxygen vacancy compensating defect mechanism; but in this structure, the other dopants all show formation of a reduced Ce3+ ion and an uncompensated oxygen hole."
[6] "We attribute this to the ease of reducibility of Ce and urge experiments on these systems to eslish the nature of the defect in trivalent-doped ceria."

Challenges associated with these computational methods include the limitations of approximations in exchange-correlation functionals, the computational cost of simulating large systems, and the interpretation of results in the context of complex reaction mechanisms. Addressing these challenges often involves the development of advanced theoretical frameworks and the utilization of high-performance computing resources.

5. The specific application of DFT and cluster models to ceria doped with trivalent cations reveals that the most stable defect state depends significantly on the ionic radius of the dopant. This insight underscores the importance of considering not only the oxidation states but also the physical properties of dopants when predicting the behavior of doped catalysts.

6. The ease of reducibility of cerium plays a crucial role in the defect chemistry observed for aluminum doping, leading to a distinct electronic structure compared to other dopants. This highlights the necessity of conducting experimental investigations to confirm the theoretical predictions regarding the nature of defects in trivalent-doped ceria.
