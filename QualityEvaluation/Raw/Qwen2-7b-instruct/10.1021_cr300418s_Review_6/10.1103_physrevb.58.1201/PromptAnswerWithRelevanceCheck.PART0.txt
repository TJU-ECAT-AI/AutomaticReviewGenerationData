[2] "For correlated materials, however, LDA can be completely wrong: the now-classic example is the canonical cuprate La2CuO4, which LDA predicts to be a nonmagnetic metal1,2 whereas it is actually an antiferromagnetic insulator."
[3] "We present a local-orbital approach to the evaluation of the on-site repulsion energy U for use in the LDA1U method of Anisimov and co-workers."
[4] "Because of these objectives, we employ a differential definition of U. We also define a matrix U, which we find is very dependent on the environment of the atom in question."
[5] "The formulation is applied to evaluate U for transition- metal monoxides from VO to NiO using a local-orbital basis set."
[6] "The resulting values of U are typically only 4065 % as large as values currently in use."
[7] "We evaluate the U matrix for the eg and t2g subshells in paramagnetic FeO, and illustrate the very different charge responses of the eg and t2g states."

The document applies the method to evaluate U for transition metal monoxides including VO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in the paramagnetic state and in a cubic rock salt structure. Comparison with values obtained by AZA shows the values are 4065% of AZA's values. Figures 1-3 depict the change in subshell charge with wd, illustrating the total change that determines U. For MnO, the positive wd decreases nt2g as expected, while neg increases. This internal d-shell charge rearrangement reduces U, leading to additional screening.

文档将该方法应用于评估V、Mn、Fe、Co和Ni等过渡金属氧化物的U值，包括它们在顺磁状态下的性质以及立方岩盐结构。与AZA方法获得的值进行比较，发现得到的值是AZA的4065%。图1-3显示了wd变化时各子壳层电荷的变化，以及决定U的总变化。以MnO为例，在图1中，正wd导致nt2g减少，如预期的那样；而neg增加。这表明d壳内部的电荷重排导致U的降低，即增加了屏蔽效应。

[1] "The results presented in Sec. V reflect a strong difference in response of the eg and t2g electrons, at least to potentials of moderate strength."
[2] "Such differences have been noted several times in the literature."
[3] "To begin to understand the response of the separate subshells, in Fig. 6 we show the on-site eg and t2g densities of states DOS! on a Ni atom in an eight-atom supercell of NiO."
[4] "The t2g states in the rocksalt structure are weakly dpp bonding and form a narrow band, whereas the eg states form dps bonds that produce wider eg bands."
[5] "From Fig. 3 it is seen that such shifts produce negligible change in the on-site eg charge, with all the difference coming entirely from the on-site t2g subshell."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The findings in Section V highlight a significant difference in the response of eg and t2g electrons, particularly to moderate potential changes. These discrepancies have been documented multiple times in previous studies. Figure 6 illustrates the on-site eg and t2g density of states (DOS) on a Ni atom within an eight-atom supercell of NiO. The t2g states exhibit weak dpp bonding and form a narrow band, whereas eg states create stronger dps bonds leading to broader eg bands. As evident from Figure 3, such adjustments result in virtually no alteration to the on-site eg charge; instead, all variations stem solely from the on-site t2g subshell.

在第V节中展示的结果反映了eg和t2g电子在中等强度势场下响应的显著差异。这些差异已经在文献中多次被提及。图6展示了Ni原子在NiO八原子超晶胞内的现场eg和t2g密度态（DOS）。t2g状态表现出弱dpp结合并形成窄带，而eg状态形成更强的dps键导致更宽的eg带。根据图3可以看出，这种调整对现场eg电荷几乎没有影响；相反，所有差异完全来自于现场t2g子壳层。

[1] "The understanding and evaluation of the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials is a long-standing problem."
[2] "For weakly correlated materials such as nearly-free-electron-like metals, covalent semiconductors, ionic solids, and even rather complex intermetallic transition metal compounds, the local-density approximation (LDA), which we understand to include the spin degree of freedom as well, to the exchange-correlation functional that occurs in density-functional theory gives very reasonable ground-state properties and even band structures which are excited-state features!"
[3] "For correlated materials, however, LDA can be completely wrong: the now-classic example is the canonical cuprate La2CuO4, which LDA predicts to be a nonmagnetic metal1,2 whereas it is actually an antiferromagnetic insulator."
[4] "Within the past few years Anisimov and co-workers have proposed an extension of the LDA approach now called LDA1U) based on lessons learned from Hubbard model studies that single out a particular local orbital and the associated on-site repulsive interaction U as the fundamental characteristic to be addressed."
[5] "Evaluation of the dynamic self-energy, which gives the description of excitations, is appropriate for comparing with many experiments, but even low-order approximations can be very tedious to evaluate."
[6] "The local-orbital basis set. We will refer to the local orbital of interest as the d orbital, although in some applications it may be an f or, rarely, an s or p orbital."
[7] "Since the method is perforce focused on an atomic orbital, it is natural to use a local-orbital basis set."
[8] "As a sum of squares of wave functions, the charge density contains two types of terms. One consists of atom-centered contributions containing the coordinate dependence flm 2 (r W2R W), and is clearly identified as a contribution to the charge from angular momentum l of the atom located at RW."
[9] "The Mulliken decomposition, which assigns half of each such term to charge component lm on the atom at RW and the other half to charge lm8 of the atom at RW8, is widely used when atomic decomposition of the charge is desired."
[10] "A central fact that must be addressed is that the total charge density cannot be decomposed, precisely or meaningfully, into simple atomic contributions alone."
[11] "We begin with a basis set of local orbitals $f%, whose lattice sums lead to the standard linear combination of atomic orbitals LCAO! Bloch basis functions for the one-electron Hamiltonian."
[12] "Without more formal justification than is normally done in the LDA1U approach and which we do not address seriously here, any change must simply be tested to see if it produces better results."
[13] "We take as our ansatz that the constant U (J) occurring in the LDA1U functional should describe the cost in potential energy of charge spin fluctuations in the actual crystal, i.e., with all normal interactions and degrees of freedom available to the electrons."
[14] "We employ then a generalized constrained density functional approach as proposed by Dederichs et al. to calculate the change in energy due to constraints on local-orbital densities."
[15] "It is convenient to introduce a vector notation for the local occupations, the constraining values, and the Lagrange parameter! potential shifts: na,sn W, and similarly for Q W and for w W."
[16] "The general behavior of the constrained energy can be seen by noting that w W is linear for small changes in occupation, i.e., linear in q W."
[17] "The constrained energy E(q W) can be decomposed into the kinetic-energy term, the interaction with the external potential, and the remainder, the potential energy Eq W5Eq W,K1Eq W,ext1Eq W,P."
[18] "The value of U that we evaluate and report below is the total net! value U5UK1UP."
[19] "For the metallic constituents of the compounds we considered, a basis set representing six s-, four p-, and three d-type functions is expanded on a set of 16 Gaussian functions."
[20] "We have applied this approach to evaluate U for the transition-metal monoxides MO, M5V, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, in the paramagnetic state and for the cubic rocksalt structure."
[21] "Figures 13 for MnO, FeO, and NiO illustrate the change in subshell charge with wd as well as the total change, which is what determines U."
[22] "In Fig. 6 we show the on-site eg and t2g densities of states DOS on a Ni atom in an eight-atom supercell of NiO, both before and after a downward shift of all d states by 20.54 eV."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing accurate and efficient calculations of electronic structures, energies, and properties of materials. These methods allow researchers to simulate and optimize catalytic reactions under various conditions, explore the effect of dopants on catalyst performance, and predict the behavior of new materials. Key considerations include the choice of basis set, functional, and potential energy function, as well as the accuracy of the approximation used in the DFT calculations. Challenges involve computational costs, limitations of the approximations used in DFT, and the complexity of modeling surface and interface phenomena. Potential benefits include the ability to rapidly screen and design new catalysts, understand reaction mechanisms at the atomic level, and tailor materials for specific catalytic tasks.

2. The main considerations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and the exploration of new catalytic materials using DFT and cluster models include:
   - **Accuracy**: Ensuring that the chosen DFT functional and basis set adequately describe the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the catalyst material and its interaction with reactants and products.
   - **Efficiency**: Minimizing computational time and resources required for simulations while maintaining acceptable accuracy. This often involves optimizing the computational workflow, utilizing parallel computing, and selecting appropriate approximations (e.g., hybrid functionals).
   - **Exploration of new materials**: The ability to systematically screen a large number of potential catalyst candidates, including those that have not yet been synthesized or characterized experimentally. This requires robust theoretical frameworks that can predict catalytic activity based on structural and electronic properties.

These methods have significant potential to accelerate the development of new, more efficient catalysts for alkane activation and other chemical transformations, thereby contributing to the advancement of green chemistry and sustainable energy technologies.
