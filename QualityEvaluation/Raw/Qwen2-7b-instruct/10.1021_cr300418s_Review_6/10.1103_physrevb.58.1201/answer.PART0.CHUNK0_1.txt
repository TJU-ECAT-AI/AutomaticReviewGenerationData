The document presents a local orbital method to evaluate the on-site repulsion energy U for use in the LDA1U method. The authors employ a differential definition of U and define a matrix U, finding it highly dependent on the atom's environment. The method is applied to evaluate U for transition-metal monoxides, resulting in values typically 4065% smaller than current values. The method's sensitivity to the choice of d orbitals and the basis set is discussed. The document evaluates the U matrix for eg and t2g subshells in paramagnetic FeO, illustrating different charge responses.

本文提出了一种局部轨道方法来评估安西莫夫及其同事提出的LDA1U方法中的局域场能量U。作者采用差分定义U，并定义了一个矩阵U，发现它高度依赖于原子的环境。该方法应用于过渡金属氧化物的评估，结果表明U值通常比现有值小4065%。该方法对所选d轨道和基组的一般敏感性进行了讨论。文档还评估了在顺磁FeO中eg和t2g子壳层的U矩阵，展示了不同电荷响应。

[1] "We have applied this approach to evaluate U for the transitions metal monoxides MO, M5V, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, in the paramagnetic state and for the cubic rocksalt structure."
[2] "Comparison is provided with values obtained by the method of AZA, and it is seen that the values obtained are 4065 % of the values obtained by AZA."
[3] "Figures 13 for MnO, FeO, and NiO illustrate the change in subshell charge with wd as well as the total change, which is what determines U."
[4] "Taking MnO, for example, it is seen in Fig. 1 that the effect of positive wd is to decrease nt2g as expected, but neg instead increases."
[5] "Clearly charge rearrangement within the d shell is leading to a reduction in U i.e., additional screening!"

The document applies the method to evaluate U for transition metal monoxides including VO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO in the paramagnetic state and in a cubic rock salt structure. Comparison with values obtained by AZA shows the values are 4065% of AZA's values. Figures 1-3 depict the change in subshell charge with wd, illustrating the total change that determines U. For MnO, the positive wd decreases nt2g as expected, while neg increases. This internal d-shell charge rearrangement reduces U, leading to additional screening.

文档将该方法应用于评估V、Mn、Fe、Co和Ni等过渡金属氧化物的U值，包括它们在顺磁状态下的性质以及立方岩盐结构。与AZA方法获得的值进行比较，发现得到的值是AZA的4065%。图1-3显示了wd变化时各子壳层电荷的变化，以及决定U的总变化。以MnO为例，在图1中，正wd导致nt2g减少，如预期的那样；而neg增加。这表明d壳内部的电荷重排导致U的降低，即增加了屏蔽效应。

[1] "The results presented in Sec. V reflect a strong difference in response of the eg and t2g electrons, at least to potentials of moderate strength."
[2] "Such differences have been noted several times in the literature."
[3] "To begin to understand the response of the separate subshells, in Fig. 6 we show the on-site eg and t2g densities of states DOS! on a Ni atom in an eight-atom supercell of NiO."
[4] "The t2g states in the rocksalt structure are weakly dpp bonding and form a narrow band, whereas the eg states form dps bonds that produce wider eg bands."
[5] "From Fig. 3 it is seen that such shifts produce negligible change in the on-site eg charge, with all the difference coming entirely from the on-site t2g subshell."

The findings in Section V highlight a significant difference in the response of eg and t2g electrons, particularly to moderate potential changes. These discrepancies have been documented multiple times in previous studies. Figure 6 illustrates the on-site eg and t2g density of states (DOS) on a Ni atom within an eight-atom supercell of NiO. The t2g states exhibit weak dpp bonding and form a narrow band, whereas eg states create stronger dps bonds leading to broader eg bands. As evident from Figure 3, such adjustments result in virtually no alteration to the on-site eg charge; instead, all variations stem solely from the on-site t2g subshell.

在第V节中展示的结果反映了eg和t2g电子在中等强度势场下响应的显著差异。这些差异已经在文献中多次被提及。图6展示了Ni原子在NiO八原子超晶胞内的现场eg和t2g密度态（DOS）。t2g状态表现出弱dpp结合并形成窄带，而eg状态形成更强的dps键导致更宽的eg带。根据图3可以看出，这种调整对现场eg电荷几乎没有影响；相反，所有差异完全来自于现场t2g子壳层。
