[1] "The understanding and evaluation of the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials is a long-standing problem."
[2] "For correlated materials, however, LDA can be completely wrong: the now-classic example is the canonical cuprate La2CuO4, which LDA predicts to be a nonmagnetic metal1,2 whereas it is actually an antiferromagnetic insulator."
[3] "We present a local-orbital approach to the evaluation of the on-site repulsion energy U for use in the LDA1U method of Anisimov and co-workers."
[4] "Because of these objectives, we employ a differential definition of U. We also define a matrix U, which we find is very dependent on the environment of the atom in question."
[5] "The formulation is applied to evaluate U for transition- metal monoxides from VO to NiO using a local-orbital basis set."
[6] "The resulting values of U are typically only 4065 % as large as values currently in use."
[7] "We evaluate the U matrix for the eg and t2g subshells in paramagnetic FeO, and illustrate the very different charge responses of the eg and t2g states."
[8] "The sensitivity of the method to the choice of the d orbitals, and to the basis set in general, is discussed."
