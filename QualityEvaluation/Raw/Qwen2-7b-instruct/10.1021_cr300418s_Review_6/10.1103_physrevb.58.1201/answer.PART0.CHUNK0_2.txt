[I] "We present a local orbital approach to the evaluation of the on-site repulsion energy U for use in the LDA1U method of Anisimov and co-workers."
[II] "Our objectives are to make the method more firmly based, to concentrate primarily on ground-state properties rather than spectra, and to test the method in cases where only modest changes in orbital occupations are expected, as well as for highly correlated materials."
[III] "The formulation is applied to evaluate U for transition- metal monoxides from VO to NiO using a local-orbital basis set. The resulting values of U are typically only 4065 % as large as values currently in use."
[IV] "The sensitivity of the method to the choice of the d orbitals, and to the basis set in general, is discussed."
[V] "The results presented in Sec. V reflect a strong difference in response of the eg and t2g electrons, at least to potentials of moderate strength."

1. A local orbital approach is presented for evaluating the on-site repulsion energy U in the LDA1U method. The goals are to strengthen the method's foundation, focus on ground-state properties, and test it in scenarios with slight changes in orbital occupations, including highly correlated materials.
2. The method is applied to assess U in transition-metal monoxides from VO to NiO using a local-orbital basis set. The calculated U values are typically 4065% smaller than existing values.
3. The method's sensitivity to the selection of d orbitals and the basis set in general is discussed.
4. The analysis shows a significant disparity in the response of eg and t2g electrons to moderate potential shifts.

1. 提出了一种局部轨道方法来评估安尼西莫夫及其同事的LDA1U方法中的局域点斥力能U。目标是加强该方法的基础，专注于基态性质而非光谱，并在仅预期轻微轨道占据变化的情况下以及对于高度关联材料测试方法。
2. 方法应用于使用局部轨道基集对从VO到NiO的过渡金属氧化物进行U的评估。计算出的U值通常比现有值小4065%。
3. 讨论了方法对所选d轨道和一般基集的敏感性。
4. 分析表明，eg和t2g电子对中等电势偏移的响应存在显著差异。
