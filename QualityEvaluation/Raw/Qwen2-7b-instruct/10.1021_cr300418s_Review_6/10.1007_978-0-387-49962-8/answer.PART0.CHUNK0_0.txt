[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially. It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[2] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
[3] "The commercial importance of catalysis and the diverse intellectual challenges of catalytic phenomena have stimulated study by a broad spectrum of scientists, including chemists, physicists, chemical engineers, and material scientists."
[4] "There are few chemical- or oil-based material items in modern society that do not depend in some way on a catalytic stage in their manufacture."
