[1] "The majority of studies regarding the reactivity of transition metal-containing bimetallic clusters have come from Kaya and coworkers (108114) and focus primarily on their reactivity toward hydrogen, because of the ability of this molecule to serve as a sensitive probe of cluster geometric and electronic structure."

Many studies on the reactivity of bimetallic clusters with transition metals have been conducted by Kaya and colleagues, focusing mainly on their interactions with hydrogen. Hydrogen acts as a sensitive indicator for the geometric and electronic structure of these clusters.

[1] "The ability of high-level electronic structure theory to describe the potential energy surfaces governing activated reactions was recently demonstrated in a study ofNbn + H2 andNbn + N2 reactions(84).ItwasobservedthatN2 andH2 reactwith niobium clusters with essentially the same size dependence (Figure 3)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
High-level electronic structure theory was recently shown to accurately describe the potential energy surfaces that govern activated reactions, as demonstrated in the study of Nbn + H2 and Nbn + N2 reactions (84). It was observed that both nitrogen and hydrogen react with niobium clusters in a manner that depends on cluster size (Figure 3).

[1] "Photoionization studies of ConNan (112), NbnAlm (116), ConVm (114), and ConMnm (115) failed to reveal any correlation of their IPs with reactivity toward hydrogen. It appears that for these systems, the observed changes in reactivity on metal atom addition/substitution were not due to global changes in electronic structure as may be reflected in IP, but rather resulted from geometric rearrangement of the cluster accompanying atom substitution."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Studies involving ConNan (112), NbnAlm (116), ConVm (114), and ConMnm (115) through photoionization did not find a correlation between their ionization potentials (IPs) and reactivity towards hydrogen. It seems that the changes in reactivity observed upon adding or substituting metal atoms in these systems were not caused by global changes in electronic structure, as indicated by IP, but rather by the geometric rearrangement of the cluster that occurred with the substitution of atoms.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
通过光离化研究ConNan（112）、NbnAlm（116）、ConVm（114）和ConMnm（115），未能发现其离子化势（IP）与对氢的反应性之间的相关性。看来，在这些系统中观察到的反应性变化并非由电子结构的全局变化导致（可能反映在IP中），而是由随原子置换发生的簇的几何重排所引起。

[1] "This suggests that ethylene does not behave merely as a polarizable point body on the surface of silver clusters (i.e. bound simply by van der Waals forces), but rather that it binds with a net ethylene cluster charge donation, thus forming a polar π-bonded complex having a net dipole moment pointing toward the cluster."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This indicates that ethylene does not merely exist as a polarizable point body on the surface of silver clusters (bound solely by van der Waals forces), but instead binds through a net donation of ethylene cluster charges, forming a polar π-bonded complex with a net dipole moment directed towards the cluster.

[1] "The observation of the ν3 band, combined with the absence of the ν6 (b1g) fundamental, which lies at 1006 cm1 in the gas phase and is IR-active under Cs (but not C2v) symmetry, confirms that ethylene effectively adopts a C2v local symmetry within the complexes."

The observation of the ν3 band, together with the absence of the ν6 (b1g) fundamental (located at 1006 cm1 in the gas phase and IR-active under Cs symmetry but not under C2v symmetry), confirms that ethylene effectively adopts a C2v local symmetry within the complexes.

[1] "The sparsity of the calculated spectra compared with those measured experimentally for Fe13H12 and Fe13D12 (see Figure 13) is likely a consequence of the high symmetry of the model, whereby the resulting degeneracies and forbidden transitions reduce the number of predicted IR bands."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The scarcity of the calculated spectra compared to the experimentally measured ones for Fe13H12 and Fe13D12 (refer to Figure 13) is probably due to the model's high symmetry, which leads to reduced predicted IR bands as a result of degeneracies and forbidden transitions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
计算谱的稀疏性与实验测量的Fe13H12和Fe13D12相比（参见图13）可能是由于模型的高度对称性，导致由退度和禁止转换引起的预测IR谱带数量减少。
