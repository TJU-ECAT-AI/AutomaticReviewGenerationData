[1] "Despite the explosion of activity over the past 15 years, the field of metal cluster chemistry remains largely unexplored territory, even at the simplest descriptive level. And although many metal cluster-molecule systems have yet to be examined forthefirsttime, eventhemostthoroughlystudiedmetalcluster-moleculereactions cannot be fully understood without a detailed knowledge of the geometric and electronic structures of the clusters themselvesstill the pieces of the structure- reactivity puzzle that are most difficult to obtain."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing detailed insights into the electronic and geometric structures of the clusters. This helps in exploring the electronic and geometric factors affecting the catalytic activity. The key considerations include the accuracy of the DFT calculations, the efficiency of the computational resources required, and the potential to discover new catalytic materials through computational screening. Challenges include the limitations of DFT approximations, the computational cost for large clusters, and the difficulty in correlating computational results with experimental outcomes. The potential benefits include reduced experimental costs, accelerated discovery of new catalysts, and a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms.

尽管在过去15年中金属簇化学领域取得了巨大进展，但该领域的探索仍然处于初级阶段，即使对于首次研究的金属簇分子系统也是如此。即使是经过深入研究的金属簇分子反应，也难以完全理解，没有对簇本身的几何和电子结构有详细的认识。计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过提供关于簇的电子和几何结构的详细信息，增强了我们预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃活化中的催化活性的能力。这有助于探索影响催化活性的电子和几何因素。关键考虑因素包括DFT计算的准确性，所需计算资源的效率以及通过计算筛选发现新催化剂的可能性。挑战包括DFT近似限制，大型簇的计算成本，以及将计算结果与实验结果相联系的困难。潜在的好处包括降低实验成本，加速新催化剂的发现，并对催化机制有更深的理解。

[1] "The sparsity of the calculated spec- tra compared with those measured experimentally for Fe13H12 and Fe13D12 (see Figure 13) is likely a consequence of the high symmetry of the model, whereby the resulting degeneracies and forbidden transitions reduce the number of predicted IR bands."

The scarcity of the calculated spectra in comparison to the measured experimental spectra for Fe13H12 and Fe13D12 is probably due to the high symmetry of the model. This leads to the occurrence of degeneracies and forbidden transitions, which subsequently decreases the number of predicted infrared bands.

计算谱图的稀疏性与实验测量的Fe13H12和Fe13D12谱图相比，可能是由于模型的高对称性导致的后果。这种高对称性引发的退简性和禁止跃迁减少了预测的红外谱带数量。
