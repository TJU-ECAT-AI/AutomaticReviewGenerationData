<p>However, until relatively recently, interpretation of metal cluster reactivity experiments has been hampered by the lack of structural information,both for the bare cluster substrates and for the product complexes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, advances in theoretical and experimental methods have enabled significant progress to be made toward solving the general problem of cluster structure determination.</p>
<p>The focus of this review is to summarize the current state of the molecular surface science of transition metal clusters.</p>
<p>The scope of this review is limited to gas-phase reactions of transition metal clusters with atoms and small molecules and concentrates mainly on reactions of neutral clusters.</p>
<p>As in conventional surface chemistry studies, the goals in studying metal cluster reactions are to determine the mechanisms, rates, and energetics of adsorption and to understand how these attributes depend on the structures of the underlying bare cluster substrates.</p>
<p>One such approach is the chemical probe technique developed by Riley & Parks (2729).</p>
<p>Although not providing absolute proof of cluster structures, this type of experiment is one of the most useful structural tools available for metal cluster structure determination, particularly for larger clusters where spectroscopic probes are not applicable.</p>
<p>For clusters containing more than approximately 10 metal atoms, the use of high-level electronic structure methods is precluded because of prohibitive computational demands.</p>

<p>Although not as accurate as state-of-the-art electronic structure methods, these methods are capable of yielding properties and geometric structures that are largely insensitive to the details of the potential.</p>
<p>Often, even the best calculations are of insufficient accuracy to predict reliably the energetic ordering among a set of close-lying isomers.</p>
<p>Cluster attributes that are amenable to both calculation and accurate measurement include their physical properties, such as ionization potential and electron affinity, as well as their spectroscopic signatures provided by photoelectron spectra, optical absorption spectra, and vibrational spectra.</p>
<p>In this way it can be ensured that the reaction products are stabilized and that the cluster-molecule reactions occur at a constant temperature.</p>
<p>However, it is sometimes desirable to conduct reactions at the opposite extreme, under high-temperature, reagent-rich conditions favoring the production of metastable products, an example of which is the met-car family of metal-carbon clusters (62, 63).</p>
<p>The sticking probabilities measured in beam-gas experiments complement the thermal rate constants by providing an absolute probability for the primary encounter, a quantity that in flow-tube experiments is obscured by the effects of subsequent collisions.</p>
<p>This is a pump-probe technique in which multiphoton absorption of IR (pump) light by the complex results in its dissociation. The pump laser-induced depletion of the product complexes is monitored by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (the probe).</p>

<p>It is generally observed that molecules possessing lone pairs of electrons such as carbon monoxide, methanol, and ammonia react with metal clusters via facile association reactions (9, 85).</p>
<p>Specifically, it was noted that those clusters having an unusually high IP compared with neighboring clusters also dis- played low reactivity and vice versa.</p>

<p>Note that this model predicts that the HOMO-LUMO gap will influence reactivity in two ways: directly, by determining the height of the activation barrier, and indirectly, through determining probability of formation of precursor complexes.</p>
<p>For example, Co5V and Co7V are several times more reactive than Co6 and Co8, whereas Co12V is less reactive toward hydrogen than is Co13 (109).</p>
<p>It is now well established that this periodicity reflects the organization of the delocalized valence electrons of the clusters into degenerate levels, forming shells akin to those displayed by atoms.</p>
<p>Generally, reactivity surveys have revealed many similarities of the reaction channels displayed by Cun, Agn, and Aun to those of the corresponding macroscopic sur- faces (5, 71, 77, 82, 137142).</p>

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the electronic and structural properties of the catalysts. They enable the exploration of new catalytic materials, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Key considerations include the choice of functional, basis set, and the ability to handle the complexity of the systems. Challenges are related to computational resources, limitations in predicting certain phenomena like long-range interactions, and the need for validation against experimental data. Benefits include the ability to screen large libraries of materials, predict reaction mechanisms, and optimize catalyst performance.

2. The focus on metal cluster reactions involves determining the mechanisms, rates, and energetics of adsorption, with a particular emphasis on understanding how these attributes depend on the structures of the underlying bare cluster substrates. Techniques such as chemical probe methods and the use of advanced spectroscopy, including photoionization and IR spectroscopy, provide structural information crucial for interpreting reactivity. The chemical probe technique, for instance, allows for the determination of the number of binding sites on a cluster, which helps in choosing a likely structure.

3. The scope of the review is limited to gas-phase reactions of transition metal clusters with atoms and small molecules, focusing mainly on neutral clusters. This narrows down the scope of study while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the reactions under controlled conditions. The review emphasizes the integration of experimental and theoretical approaches to reveal the structural origins of size effects observed in cluster reactivity.

4. The task of determining the structure of metal clusters is enormously difficult due to their size and complexity. Laser-based spectroscopic techniques are only applicable to very small clusters. Methods like zero electron kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy have provided insights into the structures of smaller clusters, but they struggle with larger clusters due to complications arising from numerous vibrational degrees of freedom, low-lying electronic states, and nonadiabatic behavior. Indirect methods, such as the chemical probe technique, are employed to infer geometries based on observable properties.

5. The chemical probe technique is one of the most useful structural tools for metal cluster structure determination, especially for larger clusters where spectroscopic probes are not applicable. This approach involves saturating the adsorption sites on the surface of the clusters with probe molecules, allowing for the inference of the number of binding sites and, consequently, the probable structure of the cluster. This method complements the limitations of spectroscopic techniques and offers a practical approach to structural determination.

6. Advances in both electronic structure methodology and computational performance have enabled accurate prediction of cluster structures, despite the complexity of the problem. Density-functional theory (DFT) stands out as a particularly promising approach, combining necessary accuracy with computational efficiency. This has led to the identification of stable structures for small nickel and cobalt clusters, which align with the experimentally determined structures.

7. For clusters containing more than approximately 10 metal atoms, high-level electronic structure methods are impractical due to prohibitive computational demands. However, for metals like nickel and the coinage metals, where reliable semiempirical potentials are available, molecular dynamics- and gradient-based methods can be used to obtain stable structures for much larger clusters. These methods, though less accurate than state-of-the-art electronic structure methods, yield properties and geometric structures that are largely insensitive to the details of the potential.

8. The lowest-energy structures obtained for small nickel clusters are generally in accord with those experimentally determined by the chemical probe method. Often, even the best calculations are insufficient to reliably predict the energetic ordering among close-lying isomers. In such cases, identifying the lowest-energy isomer among candidates can be done by comparing experimentally determined properties with theoretical predictions. Attributes like ionization potential, electron affinity, and spectroscopic signatures are amenable to both calculation and accurate measurement.

9. The beam-gas method for studying elementary chemical reactions is well-established and has been used to study the reactions of size-selected metal cluster ions. Its adaptation to neutral metal clusters is recent, offering a complementary approach to flow-tube experiments. This method involves a molecular beam of clusters passing through a differentially pumped gas cell containing reactant gas. By measuring the depletion of bare clusters and the appearance of association products, sticking probabilities can be obtained, providing an absolute probability for the primary encounter. This complements thermal rate constants by offering insight into the reaction mechanisms under single-collision conditions.

10. The reaction rates and equilibria of metal clusters with small molecules exhibit size-dependent variations, often due to changes in electronic and/or geometric structures. Facile reactions, characterized by no activation barrier, occur with high probability regardless of the detailed structure of the substrate cluster. Activated reactions, possessing an activation barrier, display significant reactivity variations from one cluster size to the next. The correlation between cluster reactivity and ionization potential, initially observed, has been refined to consider the difference between cluster ionization potential and electron affinity, highlighting the role of the promotion energy in governing activation barriers.

11. Precursor-mediated chemisorption involves the formation of weakly bound precursor complexes before the actual chemisorption occurs. This mechanism explains the observed behavior of metal cluster reactivity toward hydrogen, where rate coefficients decrease with increasing temperature for some systems. Incorporating physisorbed precursors in the overall chemisorption mechanism helps reconcile seemingly contradictory observations, such as rate coefficients that increase with decreasing temperature.

12. The involvement of precursors in cluster-molecule reactions is supported by evidence showing correlations between cluster reactivity and their propensity to form complexes with rare gases. Additionally, studies have revealed that for certain systems, the reactivity of metal clusters toward hydrogen is influenced by their polarizability, reflecting the electronic shell-filling phenomenon. This effect is superimposed on the major spherical shell-filling structure, affecting properties like ionization potentials and electron affinities.

13. While many metal cluster-molecule systems have been studied, understanding their catalytic behavior remains challenging without detailed knowledge of the geometric and electronic structures of the clusters. A comprehensive understanding of metal cluster reactions requires the application of multiple complementary experimental and theoretical methods. No single technique can provide all the necessary insights into reaction rates, pathways, and mechanisms.

12. 尽管已经研究了许多金属簇分子系统，但在没有详细了解簇的几何和电子结构的情况下，了解其催化行为仍然具有挑战性。全面理解金属簇反应需要应用多种互补的实验和理论方法。没有任何一种技术可以提供有关反应速率、途径和机制的所有必要见解。
