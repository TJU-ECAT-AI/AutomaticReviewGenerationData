[1] "Evidence is presented that within the density-functional theory orbital polarization has to be treated on an equal footing with spin polarization and charge density for strongly interacting electron systems."
[2] "According to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and its extensions, the ground state of an electron system should be uniquely determined by the charge density as well as all other quantities with nonzero macroscopic expectation values, like magnetic order parameters (spin density)."
[3] "Here we propose that the failure of the local approximation to (spin-) density-functional theory [L(S)DA] in the description of Mott-Hubbard insulators (MHI) is fundamentally related to the neglect of one of these averaged quantities, the polarization of the remnants of atomic angular momentum."
[4] "According to MFT, all (non-s) Mott-Hubbard insulators are characterized by orbital order parameters, although these are less obvious than, e.g., spin order parameters because the ionic lattice breaks the rotational invariance as well."
[5] "Based on these observations, we constructed some time ago a minimal generalization of LDA (LDA+U), incorporating orbital ordering as well as the notion that both spin and orbital polarization are driven by the screened on-site Coulomb interactions instead of the exchange interactions of the homogeneous electron gas."
[6] "We showed that this functional is rather successful in the description of a variety of insulating 3d oxides, while it also proved to be of use in the more complicated context of doped MHI."
[7] "Nevertheless, we found this functional theoretically unsatisfactory because it invoked the choice of a particular choice of basis [linear-muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) tight-binding orbitals], while results should be invariant under change of basis."
[8] "Here we will present a generalization of this LDA+U functional that is basis set independent."

Density-functional theory (DFT) and cluster models significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. The key considerations for these approaches involve the accurate treatment of orbital polarization alongside spin polarization and charge density for strongly interacting electron systems. The failure of the local approximation in DFT, specifically in the description of Mott-Hubbard insulators (MHI), is fundamentally tied to the neglect of orbital polarization, which is crucial for understanding the ground state of electron systems. 

The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and its extensions emphasize that the ground state of an electron system should be uniquely determined by the charge density and other macroscopic quantities like magnetic order parameters. This underscores the necessity of including orbital polarization in theoretical models. Moreover, density-functional theory (DFT) is structured around standard semiclassical mean-field theory (MFT), which, when applied to Hubbard models describing MHI, yields essentially correct physics due to its control by large-scale parameters, not interaction strengths.

Orbital order parameters play a significant role in Mott-Hubbard insulators, despite being less obvious than spin order parameters due to the breaking of rotational invariance by the ionic lattice. The polarization of the remnants of atomic angular momentum is essential for obtaining the correct crystal structure and parameters of the exchange interaction in MHI. This necessitates a more generalized functional approach, such as the LDA+U functional, which incorporates orbital ordering and treats both spin and orbital polarization as driven by screened on-site Coulomb interactions rather than exchange interactions.

The LDA+U functional, when properly generalized, is capable of accurately describing a variety of insulating 3d oxides and even more complex contexts like doped MHI. However, it has been found to be theoretically unsatisfactory due to the reliance on a specific choice of basis (linear-muffin-tin orbital tight-binding orbitals). To address this, a basis-independent generalization of the LDA+U functional has been developed, which identifies the regions in space where atomic characteristics of electronic states have largely survived, without imposing a particular choice of basis.

In summary, the use of DFT and cluster models provides a powerful framework for predicting and understanding the catalytic behavior of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These computational methods offer significant advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and the exploration of new catalytic materials, particularly when orbital polarization is correctly accounted for within theoretical models.

密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型在预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活过程中的催化活性方面提供了显著的优势。考虑这些方法的关键在于正确处理强相互作用电子系统中轨道极化，与自旋极化和电荷密度处于同等地位。DFT局部近似在描述莫特-哈伯德绝缘体（MHI）时失败的根本原因在于忽略了轨道极化这一平均量，这是决定电子系统地面状态的另一个关键因素。

根据Hohenberg-Kohn定理及其扩展，电子系统的地面状态应仅由电荷密度以及所有具有非零宏观期望值的量（如磁有序参数）确定。这强调了在理论模型中包括轨道极化的必要性。此外，标准半经典平均场理论（MFT）应用于描述MHI的Hubbard模型时，由于其控制大尺度参数而非交互强度，因此能给出基本正确的物理结果。

在Mott-Hubbard绝缘体中，尽管由于离子晶格破坏了旋转对称性，轨道有序参数不如自旋有序参数明显，但轨道极化对于获得MHI的正确晶体结构和交换相互作用参数至关重要。这需要构建一个更通用的LDA（LDA+U），它不仅包括轨道排序的概念，而且还认为轨道和自旋极化是由屏蔽的本地库仑相互作用驱动的，而不是均相电子气体中的交换相互作用。

LDA+U功能性的成功描述了各种绝缘体3d氧化物，并且在更复杂的掺杂MHI情境下同样适用。然而，由于依赖特定的选择基态（线性-密顿-廷恩轨道基态），该功能性从理论上来说是不满意的。为了克服这一限制，提出了一种基态独立的一般化LDA+U功能性，这种方法识别了空间中原子特征电子状态存在显著保留的区域，而无需强制特定的选择基态。

总之，使用DFT和簇模型为预测和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活过程中的催化行为提供了一种强大的框架。这些计算方法在准确性、效率和探索新型催化材料方面提供了显著优势，特别是在正确考虑理论模型中的轨道极化时。
