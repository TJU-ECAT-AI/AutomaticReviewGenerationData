"We found this functional theoretically unsatisfactory because it invoked the choice of a particular choice of basis [linear- muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) tight-binding orbitals],while results should be invariant under change of basis."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The authors deemed the previously developed functional inadequate because it relied on a specific choice of basis (linear muffin-tin orbital tight-binding orbitals), which contradicted the theoretical requirement for results to remain unchanged under a change of basis.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Despite its success in describing various 3d oxides and its utility in more complex scenarios, the authors found the functional lacking because it required a specific choice of basis (linear muffin-tin orbital tight-binding orbitals), which should ideally be invariant under a change of basis.

"It means that exchange-only and lattice-electron ("electron-phonon") interactions in LSDA are not enough to drive the collective Jahn-Teller distortion:the orbital-dependent interaction terms must be included in the functional as is the case with LDA+U."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This signifies that in LSDA, only exchange interactions and lattice-electron ("electron-phonon") interactions are insufficient to induce the collective Jahn-Teller distortion; the orbital-dependent interaction terms must be incorporated into the functional, akin to how they are handled in LDA+U.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这意味着在LSDA中，仅有的交换作用和晶格电子（“电子-声子”）相互作用不足以驱动集体Jahn-Teller畸变；必须将轨道依赖的相互作用项包含在功能中，类似于LDA+U中的处理方式。
