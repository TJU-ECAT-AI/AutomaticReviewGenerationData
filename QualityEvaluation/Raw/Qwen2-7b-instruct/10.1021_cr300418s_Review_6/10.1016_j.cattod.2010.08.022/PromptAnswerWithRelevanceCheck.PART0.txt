4.1. Characterization of the size of the supported clusters by SEM and GISAXS Representative SEM images obtained on a silver sample before and after reaction are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The average lateral diameter of the clusters is determined by using the Scion Image software. The error bar is the standard deviation of the corresponding particle size counted from several SEM images on different areas of the given sample. The samples #1, #2 and #3 consisted of discrete silver clusters with an average size of 23.3, 12 and 8.7 nm, respectively, with a very narrow size distribution (<5%) as shown with bars in Fig. 4c. No noticeable change is observed in the mean cluster size and its distribution before and after the reaction. Cluster lateral diameters determined by GISAXS for sam- ples #1 and #2 are also very well matched with SEM results. The density of the silver particles on sample #3 is too low for accu-rate GISAXS measurements. 

4.2. TPRx: size-dependent activity and selectivity Fig. 5a shows turn-over rates (TOR) of propylene oxide formation per surface atom on various size silver cluster catalysts. The smaller size silver clusters #2 and #3 (12 and 8.7 nm lateral diameters, respectively) start to react at much lower temperature than the largest particles #1 (23.3 nm); the latter start to show catalytic activity at 80 C and reaching maximum activity at 150 C [24].

5.3.1. Interaction of propylene or propylene/oxygen mixture with Ag particle surface In order to gain a better understanding of the experimental results under catalytic conditions, the interaction of propylene with various models of oxygen-covered silver nanoparticles have been studied, considering cases with both small and large con-centrations of surface oxygen (in the latter case, leading to the effective formation of a thin surface oxide). In the first place, we use the Ag(1 1 1) surface as a reasonable approximation of facet sites on large (10 nm) nanoparticles. Two oxygen adatoms are then placed on the surface, and pathways for either propylene oxide (C3H6O) or acrolein (C3H4O) formation are evaluated, start-ing from a propylene oxametallacycle (OMC) intermediate.

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms and the effects of catalyst size and structure. Key considerations, challenges, and potential benefits of these approaches include:

1. **Accuracy**: DFT calculations offer a high degree of accuracy in predicting the electronic structure and energetics of reactions, allowing for precise modeling of adsorption processes and reaction pathways. This enables a detailed understanding of how different catalyst structures affect alkane activation.

2. **Efficiency**: Cluster models, especially sub-nanometer clusters, are computationally efficient alternatives to studying bulk materials, allowing for rapid screening of large numbers of catalyst candidates. This efficiency is crucial for identifying promising materials that require further experimental validation.

3. **Exploration of new materials**: Theoretical calculations can guide the synthesis of novel catalysts with desired properties by predicting which compositions and geometries might be most effective. This can lead to the discovery of new catalysts with improved performance.

4. **Understanding size effects**: The literature shows that the catalytic activity and selectivity of silver-based catalysts change significantly with size, affecting the reaction mechanisms. Computational methods can elucidate why these changes occur, providing insights into the role of surface area, coordination, and defect sites.

5. **Predicting reaction pathways**: DFT calculations can predict the activation energies for key steps in the reaction pathway, helping to identify the most favorable routes for alkane activation. This aids in designing catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes into desired products.

6. **Analyzing catalyst morphology**: Techniques like Grazing Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and High-Resolution Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRETEM) provide spatial information about catalyst morphology. Computational methods can complement these experiments by simulating how changes in morphology affect catalytic performance.

Challenges include the computational resources required for extensive simulations, the limitations of empirical parameters in DFT calculations, and the difficulty in accurately representing complex interfaces between catalysts and reactants. Despite these challenges, the combination of experimental techniques with computational methods offers a powerful approach to optimizing catalysts for alkane activation, leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.
