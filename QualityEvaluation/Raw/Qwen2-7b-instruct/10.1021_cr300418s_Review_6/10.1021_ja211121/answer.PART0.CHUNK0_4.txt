Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation through their capacity to simulate and explore the electronic structure, coordination environment, and reaction pathways of the catalysts with high accuracy. Key considerations in employing these methods include the choice of basis set, the level of theory, and the inclusion of dispersion corrections to better describe the interactions between atoms. The main challenges associated with these methods involve computational cost and the need for extensive parameterization of the models to accurately represent complex systems. Despite these challenges, the benefits of using DFT and cluster models are significant, including the ability to screen large numbers of catalyst candidates efficiently and to gain insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing the catalytic process.
