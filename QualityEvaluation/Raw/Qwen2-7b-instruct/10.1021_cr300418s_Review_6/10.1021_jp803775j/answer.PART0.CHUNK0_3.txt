Computational methods, especially density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These methods consider the electronic structure and interactions within the catalyst, allowing for precise predictions of their performance. Challenges include the computational cost and the complexity of accurately modeling large systems. Potential benefits include the ability to screen and design new catalysts with improved activity and selectivity, as well as the opportunity to explore the effects of various dopants on the catalyst's properties.
