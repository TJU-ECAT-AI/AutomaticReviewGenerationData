1. Transition metals can act as homogeneous oxidation catalysts by behaving as Lewis acids, coordinating with the substrate or oxidizing reagent to enhance their reactivity.

2. An asymmetric BaeyerVilliger reaction for the synthesis of β-substituted γ-butyrolactones has been reported, utilizing an enantiomerically pure acetal as a chiral auxiliary.

3. The MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction is an oxidation process where a carbonylic compound is reduced using 2-propanol, aluminum isopropoxide as catalyst, and other reducing agents.
