[1] "Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates whose lattice consists of a network of SiO44- and AlO45- tetrahedra with Si or Al atoms at the centers and oxygen atoms in each corner."
[2] "A network of SiO44- tetrahedra is neutral; each AlO45- tetrahedron introduces one negative charge in the lattice."
[3] "The tetrahedra share the corners or edges; thus, the number of oxygens is twice that of Si plus Al atoms."
[4] "The total surface area of zeolites is the sum of the external and internal surfaces."
[5] "In the case of polyoxometalates, a widely used methodology to recover the catalyst is support the soluble Lewis acids onto an insoluble solid."

1. Zeolites are composed of a network of silicon and aluminum tetrahedra arranged in a crystalline lattice. Each aluminum tetrahedron contributes a negative charge to balance the neutral state of the silicon tetrahedra.
2. The structure of zeolites includes both silicon and aluminum tetrahedra, with the total number of oxygen atoms being twice the sum of silicon and aluminum atoms.
3. Zeolites have a high surface area, which is the aggregate of both their external and internal surfaces.
4. The recovery of catalysts like polyoxometalates can be achieved by immobilizing the soluble Lewis acids onto an insoluble solid support.

1. 硅铝沸石由硅和铝四面体构成的晶体网络组成。每个铝四面体向晶格贡献一个负电荷以平衡硅四面体的中性状态。
2. 硅铝沸石结构包括硅和铝四面体，总氧原子数量是硅和铝原子总数的两倍。
3. 硅铝沸石具有高表面积，这是其外部和内部表面的综合结果。
4. 催化剂如多酸盐的回收可以通过将可溶性路易斯酸固定在不溶性固体载体上实现。
