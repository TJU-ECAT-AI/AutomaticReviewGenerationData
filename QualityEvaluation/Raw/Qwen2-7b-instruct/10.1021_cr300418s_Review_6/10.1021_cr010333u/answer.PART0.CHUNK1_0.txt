The document discusses the use of transition metal-containing zeolites for various oxidation reactions. It mentions the synthesis and characterization of various transition metal (Ti, V, Cr, Co, Sn) substituted zeolites, their catalytic activity in reactions such as olefin epoxidation, alcohol oxidation, alkane oxidation, and the use of different oxidants like hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides. It also discusses the mechanism of these reactions and the role of Lewis acidity in the catalysts. However, it does not specifically address the use of computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, in predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation.
