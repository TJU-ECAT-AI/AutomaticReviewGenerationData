Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our understanding of the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by simulating and analyzing the interactions between catalysts and substrates. These tools enable the prediction of behavior under various conditions, facilitating the discovery of new catalysts with improved performance and selectivity. However, accuracy depends on the quality of input parameters and computational resources, while efficiency can be improved through approximations and simplifications, potentially sacrificing precision. Extensive computational screening is required for exploring new materials, which can be resource-intensive.
