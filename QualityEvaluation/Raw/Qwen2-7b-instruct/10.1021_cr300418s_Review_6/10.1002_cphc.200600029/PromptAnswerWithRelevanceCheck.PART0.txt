[1] "The current knowledge of the factors controlling the reactivity of small supported gold clusters at the molecular level has been discussed. It is shown that defect sites in the magnesium oxide support stabilize gold clusters. Whereas Au8/MgO(defect- poor) is found to be inert, Au8/MgO(FC) is highly active for CO oxidation. The key for understanding this change in reactivity is cluster charging. Calculations show that the F center in MgO leads to cluster charging, thus activating oxygen and carbon monoxide molecules adsorbed on Au8."
