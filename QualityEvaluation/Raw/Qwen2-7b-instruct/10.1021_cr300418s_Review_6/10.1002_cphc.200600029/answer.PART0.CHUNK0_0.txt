1. Computational methods, especially density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation.
2. The presence of defect sites in magnesium oxide supports stabilizes gold clusters, and Au8/MgO(FC) shows high activity in CO oxidation, contrasting with Au8/MgO(defect-poor) which is found to be inert.
3. The introduction of an F center in MgO leads to cluster charging, which activates oxygen and carbon monoxide molecules adsorbed on Au8, thereby increasing its catalytic activity.
4. Cluster charging can be experimentally observed through a red shift in the CO stretching frequency of adsorbed CO.
5. The promotional effect of water is explained by the formation of an H2OO2 complex, involving partial proton sharing, which facilitates the reaction with CO.
6. Activation of the OO bond through water's influence allows for easier reaction with CO.

1. 计算方法，尤其是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，显著增强了我们预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃激活中的催化活性的能力。
2. 镁氧化物支持中缺陷位点的存在稳定了金簇，而Au8/MgO(FC)表现出对CO氧化的高度活性，与Au8/MgO(defect-poor)发现为惰性形成对比。
3. MgO中的F中心的引入导致簇充电，从而激活吸附在Au8上的氧和一氧化碳分子，进而增加其催化活性。
4. 通过红移的CO拉伸频率观察到簇充电，这是吸附CO实验上可以观察到的簇充电的证据。
5. 水的促进效果通过形成一个H2OO2复合物来解释，涉及部分质子共享，这使得与CO反应更加容易。
6. 通过水的影响激活OO键允许更轻松地与CO反应。
