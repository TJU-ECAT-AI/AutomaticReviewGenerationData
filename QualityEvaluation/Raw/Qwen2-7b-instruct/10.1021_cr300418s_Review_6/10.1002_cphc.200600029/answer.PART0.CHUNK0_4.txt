[1] "The current knowledge of the factors controlling the reactivity of small supported gold clusters at the molecular level has been discussed. It is shown that defect sites in the magnesium oxide support stabilize gold clusters. Whereas Au8/MgO(defect- poor) is found to be inert, Au8/MgO(FC) is highly active for CO oxidation. The key for understanding this change in reactivity is cluster charging. Calculations show that the F center in MgO leads to cluster charging, thus activating oxygen and carbon monoxide molecules adsorbed on Au8."
[2] "The promotional effect of water can be explained by the formation of an H2OO2 complex, which involves partial proton sharing."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by allowing precise calculations of electronic structures and interactions at the atomic level. This enables researchers to explore the effects of dopants, such as oxygen vacancies (F centers), on catalyst performance. Key considerations include ensuring the accuracy of the theoretical models, optimizing computational efficiency, and using these insights to design new materials with enhanced catalytic properties.

2. The accuracy, efficiency, and exploration of new catalytic materials are potential benefits of using computational methods. DFT calculations can predict the electronic structure of catalysts, including the activation of reactants like oxygen and carbon monoxide, and the promotion effect of water by forming an H2OO2 complex. Challenges include the computational cost of performing large-scale simulations and the need for careful validation against experimental data.

3. The promotional effect of water in gold clusters is explained by the formation of an H2OO2 complex, which involves partial proton sharing, leading to the activation of the oxygen molecule and facilitating its reaction with other molecules, such as carbon monoxide.
