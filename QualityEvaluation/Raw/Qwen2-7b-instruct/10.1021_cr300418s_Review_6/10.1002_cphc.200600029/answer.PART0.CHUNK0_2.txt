[1] "There are several reasons why gold has for a long time been regarded as a poor catalyst in heterogeneous catalysis."
[2] "However, it was the work of Haruta et al. which clearly established the exciting catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles."
[3] "CO oxidation was reported at temperatures as low as 200 K, which makes gold interesting for a series of applications at room temperature."
[4] "Despite the number of publications concerning CO oxidation on gold nanoparticles, the reaction mechanism and the factors controlling the reactivity are still not well understood."
[5] "It seems that the relatively weak adsorption energy of oxygen on gold and the formation of activated oxygen molecules are the key for low-temperature catalysis."
[6] "This is partially due to the variety of supports and preparation procedures used, which leads to contradictory reports on the catalytic activity and the importance of the experimental variables."
[7] "For example, it is now well-established that independent of the substrate, molecular O2, most likely O2 , reacts with CO to form CO2 and no oxygen dissociation occurs upon adsorption on gold nanoparticles."
[8] "In fact, it was found that only one oxygen molecule adsorbs on the clusters."
[9] "Moreover, the promotional effect of water can be explained by the formation of an H2OO2 complex, which involves partial proton sharing."
[10] "The OO bond is activated, thus facilitating the reaction with CO."
