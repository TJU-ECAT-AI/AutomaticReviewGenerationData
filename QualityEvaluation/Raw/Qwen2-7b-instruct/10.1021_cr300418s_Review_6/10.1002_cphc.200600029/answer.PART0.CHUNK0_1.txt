The computational methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly improve our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. Key considerations in these approaches include accuracy, efficiency, and the exploration of new catalytic materials. DFT calculations provide insights into the electronic structures and properties of materials at the atomic level, aiding in the prediction of reactivity. Cluster models, focusing on size-selected gold clusters, enable detailed studies of the underlying concepts on well-defined model systems. Quantum mechanical ab initio calculations offer a comprehensive view of the reaction mechanism, revealing differences across various systems defined by parameters such as cluster size, support, experimental conditions, etc. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations highlight the influence of factors like the oxide support, its defects, cluster charging, structural fluxionality, and size dependency on reactivity. The promotional effect of water is explained through the formation of an H2OO2 complex, which activates the OO bond and facilitates the reaction with CO. Cluster charging, influenced by dopants such as F centers, enhances the catalytic activity by activating oxygen and carbon monoxide molecules. Structural fluxionality is crucial for the reactivity of gold clusters, as it allows dynamic adaptation of the structure to facilitate reactions along the most favorable free-energy path.
