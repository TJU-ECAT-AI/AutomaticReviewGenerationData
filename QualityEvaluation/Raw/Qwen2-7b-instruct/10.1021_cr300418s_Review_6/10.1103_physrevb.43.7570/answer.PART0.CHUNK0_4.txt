[1] "The meaning of U has been carefully discussed by Herring. 2 In, e.g. , a 3d electron system with n 3d electrons per atom, U is defined as the energy cost for the reaction 2(d")  d"+'+ d"-',i.e., the energy cost for moving a 3d electron between two atoms which both initially had n 3d electrons."
[2] "Thus the number of 4s and 4p electrons on an atom with n+ 1 3d electrons is reduced and the number on an atom with n 1 3d electrons is increased."
[3] "Herring argued that for metals the screening by 4s and 4p electrons is very efficient, and that one therefore ought to consider the reaction"
[4] "For strongly correlated systems,where accurate abinitio calculations are diKcult to perform,our understand- ing of the physical properties is often based on a model Hamiltonian approach."
[5] "The 4s and 4p wave functions must be orthogonal to the s and p core states. This forces the 4s and 4p wave functions to be located primarily outside the core region."
[6] "In this paper we show that because of this, the screening in Bd metals is far from perfect while it is quite efficient for 4f systems."
[7] "For Ce there is a slight overscreening by about 105%."
[8] "The integrals for Fe are slightly larger for Fe than for Ce, because of the effect of renormalizing the wave functions to the Wigner-Seitz radius."

The effective Coulomb interaction (U) between localized electrons in metals, particularly 3d and 4f systems, is crucial for understanding their electronic properties. It is defined as the energy cost for moving an electron between two atoms with identical electron configurations. Herring emphasizes that screening by 4s and 4p electrons is very efficient for metals, reducing this energy cost. However, the paper reveals that the screening in bulk d-band (Bd) metals is far from perfect, unlike in 4f systems. The calculations for Fe and Ce demonstrate that changes in electron density are only partially screened within the atom, with 50% and 105% screening efficiency, respectively. This inefficiency is attributed to the orthogonality requirement of screening wave functions with respect to core states, leading to extended wave functions and broader bands, which in turn reduce screening effectiveness. The results for metallic 3d systems like Fe diverge from experimental findings, while those for nonmetallic 3d systems and 4f systems align better with experimental observations.

对于金属中的局部电子之间（特别是3d和4f系统）的有效库仑相互作用（U），理解它们的电子性质至关重要。它被定义为将电子从具有相同电子配置的两个原子之间移动的能量成本。赫林强调，对于金属而言，4s和4p电子的屏蔽非常有效，可以降低这一能量成本。然而，论文揭示了在带隙（Bd）金属中，电子密度的变化远未完全屏蔽，在Fe和Ce的计算结果中分别只有50%和105%的屏蔽效率。这种低效性归因于屏蔽波函数与核心状态的正交性要求，导致波函数扩展且带宽更宽，从而降低了屏蔽效果。对于3d系统的金属Fe的结果与实验结果不符，而非金属3d系统和4f系统的结果则与实验观察更为一致。
