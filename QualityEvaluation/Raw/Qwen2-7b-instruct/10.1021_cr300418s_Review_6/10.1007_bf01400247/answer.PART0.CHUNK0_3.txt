[1] "We shall now present the structure of the two-atom molecular spectra, as they arise from quantum mechanics, with the aid of a method that has already been used for the analysis of atomic spectra."
[2] "This appears to allow us to handle uniformly the four questions arising and to derive all rules, selection prohibitions, or non-standard types of spectra."
[3] "From previous investigations of the quantum mechanical structure of these spectra, we may especially mention the fundamental studies by F. Hund, who attempted to address this question on a semi-quantum-mechanical, semi-correspondence basis."
[4] "The process of assembling the atoms into a molecule, or separating the molecule into atoms, acquires an immediate physical significance through the Frank-Condons' notions regarding the band convergence point."
[5] "We should like to refer to the work by R. de L. Kronig, which clarified some ambiguous points in the Hund theory."
[6] "W. Heisenberg provided the explanation for the disappearance of lines and intensity changes in bands with two identical atoms."
[7] "The foundational assumptions of these works were substantiated by M. Born and J. R. Oppenheimer, who demonstrated why the nuclear motion could be approximated to the first order."
[8] "We have also performed this calculation by first introducing the correct first-order approximation (7) for the eigenfunction into the Schrödinger equation and calculating the first-order energy approximation E - (p, Hp)."
[9] "The reciprocal moment of inertia is therefore \( \frac{M_z}{M_2} \) \( \left(\frac{9^+}{9^+}\right) \) \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \)."
[10] "The a-Type splitting appears in the second-order approximation for L-term states."
[11] "The splitting for E₁ amounts to \( 16 \frac{I}{\left(1 + 1\right)} \) \( \sum_{n} \), where the summation symbol runs over all Z-term states, \( E_n \), 1 being the energy of the concerned \( 2^{-} \) state with respect to the excitation quantum number."
[12] "The electron eigenfunction belonging to the nth X-term is denoted as \( \psi_n \)."
[13] "Then, \( \psi_{n'} \) is given by \( \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \left[\left(\cos\theta\right) \psi_{n, \theta} + \left(\sin\theta\right) \psi_{n, \theta}^{'}\right] \), where \( \theta \) is the angle between the relative positions of the nth and nth+1 electrons."
[14] "The structure of the two-atom molecular spectra is discussed in relation to this work."
[15] "In the last paragraph, we provide a comparative table of the two naming conventions."
[16] "In the following, we consider the Schrödinger equation with the center-of-mass coordinates already separated; \( x_l, y_l, z_l \)" 
[17] "These are the Cartesian coordinates of the electrons, where we also write \( r_l \), etc., and \( X, \phi, Z \) are the coordinates of one nucleus, while the coordinates of the other nucleus are \( X, \phi, Z \) when \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are the masses of the two nuclei."
[18] "The interchange of the two nuclei in molecular compounds with identical nuclei means replacing \( X, Y, Z \) by \( -X, -Y, -Z \)."
[19] "For a molecule with two unequal nuclei, we first consider the rotation of the entire molecule and assume the nuclei are on the Z-axis, thus \( X = Y = 0 \) is assumed."
[20] "The problem then has the Z-axis as a symmetry axis, and every plane passing through Z as a symmetry plane."
[21] "In this case, the symmetry group is a two-dimensional rotational-reflection group."
[22] "There are two irreducible representations of degree 1, both corresponding to a simple rotation."
[23] "In the second case, a reflection corresponds to this matrix, and in the third case, the matrix (-1)."
[24] "All other representations are of degree 2."
[25] "For each of the representations described above, we obtain two representations of our enhanced group."
[26] "We receive them by assigning the same matrix as in w 3 to those operations that do not contain a reflection in the XY-plane, and either this matrix or the matrix multiplied by -1 to those that do contain such a reflection."
[27] "In the first case, we obtain the representations we denote as \( 0^+, 0^-, 1^+, 2^+, ... \) (2a), and in the second case, we denote them with \( 0^-, 0^", 1^-, 2^-, ... \) (2a')."
[28] "If L is not equal to 0 (better said, not equal to 0 or 0' respectively 0+, 0'+,0-, or 0"), then we can denote the two eigenfunctions belonging to the same electron term with \( q^+,z (Z, r_x, ..., r_n) \) and \( q^-_z(Z, r_x, ..., r_n) \) (3)."
[29] "However, if L is equal to 0 or 0', then we only have one eigenfunction \( \psi_o(Z, r_x, ..., r_n) \) respectively \( \psi_o(Z, r_x, ..., r_n) \). (3 a)"
[30] "We can introduce new coordinates, namely first the mutual configuration of electrons and nuclei, which we set with the letter g."
[31] "When we set \( q^{0+},z (Z, g) \) = \( e^{i\theta} q^{+,z}(g) \) and rotate the system around the Z-axis by the angle \( \theta' \), we get \( q^{0+},z(\theta, g) = e^{i\theta'} q^{+,z}(g) \)."
[32] "The eigenfunction of the state reflected in the YZ-plane is denoted as \( \psi \), then due to (1 a), \( \psi = -\psi \) if \( s \) is 0."
[33] "Otherwise, \( \psi_0 \) is \( \psi \) and \( \psi_1 \) is \( -\psi \)."
[34] "Now, we consider the case where \( L \neq 0 \), meaning the rotational energy is greater than the exchange interaction energy of the electron magnets."
[35] "Then, we must now consider the rotation of the molecule and no longer fix the nuclei along the Z-axis."
[36] "Simultaneously, the symmetry of our problem increases because we now have a three-dimensional rotational-reflection symmetry."
[37] "This fact leads us to determine the dependence on \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \)."
[38] "If \( \alpha \) is the Euler angle for rotation with angles \( a, \beta, \theta \), then \( \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) = D_{\alpha, \beta, \theta} (r) \psi(o, o, o, g) \)."
[39] "For \( \beta \neq 0 \), we assume that \( \psi(0, o, o, g) = e^{i\theta} q^{+,z}(g) + c e^{-i\theta} q^{-z}(g) \) with a temporarily arbitrary constant \( c \)."
[40] "This leads to \( \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) = D_{\alpha, \beta, \theta} (r) q^{+,z}(g) + c D_{\alpha, \beta, \theta} (r) q^{-z}(g) \) (6b) for the eigenfunction with magnetic quantum number \( r \), rotational quantum number \( \lambda \), and electron angular momentum \( l \)."
[41] "If \( 2 \neq 0 \) or 0', then the second term on the right side of (6b) can be discarded, and \( X, Y, Z, x_1, ..., z \) stand for \( a, \beta, \theta \), respectively, which are the Euler angles through which \( X, Y, Z, x_1, ..., z \) are rotated."
[42] "Performing this in (6b), we get \( \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) = -12\psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) + ce^{i\theta} \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) + ce^{-i\theta} \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) \)."
[43] "These two linear combinations of (6a), apart from the normalization factor, are \( \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) = (\psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) + \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g)) + c (\psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g) - \psi(\alpha, \beta, \theta, g)) \)."
[44] "If \( \psi \) is symmetric with respect to the nuclei, we must determine whether the eigenfunctions (7) are symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the nuclei."
[45] "To do this, we replace \( X, Y, Z \) with \( -X, -Y, -Z \), which we can do since we first apply \( p \) in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the two nuclei."
[46] "Then, we replace \( \theta \) with \( -\theta \), which introduces a factor of \( -1 \)."
[47] "This operation leaves \( X, Y, Z \) unchanged, replaces \( x_i, y_i, z_i \) with \( -x_i, -y_i, -z_i \)."
[48] "Therefore, we must reflect the entire system in the origin, which gives a factor of 1 for positive terms and -1 for negative terms."
[49] "The eigenfunction is thus symmetric with respect to the nuclei when, for example, it is positive under reflection in the origin, indicating a \( + \) term."
[50] "If there is an even number of these conditions missing, then the eigenfunction is symmetric, and if an odd number is missing, it is antisymmetric."
[51] "Although we still need to introduce the spin coordinates of the electrons, we will summarize the results obtained in the figure."
[52] "Each horizontal line represents a type of electron vibrational term, with the representation properties of the electron term indicated in w 3 and 4."
[53] "The figure applies precisely to singlets."
[54] "The rotational quantum number indicates the positive terms, and the negative terms are denoted by -."
[55] "Symmetric in the nuclei are not denoted, and antisymmetric in the nuclei are denoted with a small stroke under the x or ]."
[56] "The selection rules, which also hold when adding the magnetic moments of the electrons, are strict: positive terms combine only with negative ones, and negative ones with positive ones."
[57] "Only symmetric or antisymmetric terms combine among themselves."
[58] "The rule \( \lambda = 4 - 1 \) or 0 applies only in the case of small multiplet splitting, which we can assume in case b)."
[59] "The rule \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \) is valid only when the rotational splitting is small, practically it is well satisfied."
[60] "The horizontal scale in the table is naturally distorted and does not correspond to the energetic scale, which is actually \( (l - 1) \) and is located at the bottom."
[61] "We still write down the band types that can be inferred from the preceding (7) without further ado and also read off from the table (excluding the prohibition 0 <-> 0')."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing a systematic approach to calculate electronic structures and properties of materials. These methods enable us to model the interactions between the catalyst surface and alkane molecules, predict reaction pathways, and estimate the activation energies. By exploring various dopants and structural configurations, we can optimize the catalyst design for improved efficiency and selectivity. The key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical models, computational efficiency, and the ability to explore a wide range of materials and conditions, which can lead to the discovery of new catalytic materials with enhanced performance.

2. The challenges associated with these approaches include the complexity of modeling real-world conditions, limitations in the representativeness of simplified models, and the computational resources required for large-scale simulations. Potential benefits include a deeper understanding of catalytic mechanisms, the ability to screen and design materials without the need for extensive experimental work, and the potential for rational material design to tailor catalyst properties for specific applications. The exploration of new catalytic materials through computational methods can significantly accelerate the development process and contribute to advancements in chemical synthesis and energy conversion technologies.

3. In terms of accuracy, DFT calculations can provide reliable predictions of electronic properties, but the choice of functional and basis set affects the quality of the results. Efficiency improvements come from advances in computational algorithms and hardware, allowing for larger and more complex systems to be studied. The exploration of new catalytic materials is facilitated by the ability to quickly test numerous possibilities in silico, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional experimental methods. However, the translation of computational insights into practical applications often requires validation through experimental characterization, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between computational scientists and experimentalists.

4. The use of DFT and cluster models in the context of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation can lead to significant benefits in terms of enhancing catalytic activity, improving product selectivity, and reducing the environmental impact of chemical processes. By optimizing the doping strategy and structure of the catalyst, we can tailor its reactivity towards desired alkane reactions, such as hydroalkylation or hydrogenation, leading to more efficient and sustainable manufacturing processes. Additionally, computational methods can guide the development of novel oxide catalysts that exhibit superior performance compared to conventional materials, potentially revolutionizing industries that rely heavily on chemical transformations.
