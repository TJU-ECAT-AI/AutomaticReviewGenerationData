[1] "We examine a large number of DFT calculations regarding the chemistry of oxide surfaces and show that their qualitative conclusions can be predicted by using a few rules derived from the Lewis acidbase properties of the species involved."
[2] "In a reaction, the Lewis acid gains Bader charge, and the Lewis base loses it."
[3] "The binding energy of a Lewis acid to an oxide surface can be increased substantially if the surface is modified to become a Lewis base."
[4] "The binding energy of a Lewis base can be increased by modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid, which can be achieved by doping with low-valence dopants."
[5] "Reducible oxides are Lewis acids, and this acidity lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of single metal atoms."
[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen)."

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation in several key ways:

1. Predictive Power: DFT allows for the prediction of the catalytic activity of doped oxides based on the Lewis acid-base properties of the involved species. This is achieved by deriving rules that correlate the chemical behavior of adsorbates on oxide surfaces with their Lewis acid-base characteristics.

2. Quantitative Analysis: DFT calculations provide quantitative data on binding energies, charges, and other properties of adsorbates on oxide surfaces, enabling precise comparisons and predictions.

3. Efficiency: Cluster models and other simplified representations allow for efficient exploration of large numbers of possible catalyst configurations, providing insights into the optimal structures and dopants for specific applications.

4. Exploration of New Materials: DFT simulations can predict the properties of novel catalysts, guiding the synthesis and testing of new materials with desired catalytic properties.

Challenges include the need for accurate functional forms in DFT calculations, the complexity of modeling real-world conditions, and the computational resources required for extensive simulations. Despite these challenges, the benefits of computational methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and the exploration of new catalytic materials are significant and continue to drive advancements in the field.
