[1] "The authors declare no competing financial interest."
[2] "We denote the group formed by O2 adsorption on the dopant by DO2 where D is the dopant. Similarly, we use DO for the dopant with an oxygen atom (captured from the gas, not from the oxide) bound to it."
[3] "If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2, but it does not manage to neutralize its acidity completely. Therefore, the adsorbed O2 is capable of reacting with Lewis bases."
[4] "If the dopant is a very strong base, it neutralized the (Lewis acid) O2 completely, so it will no longer react with Lewis bases. In this case, it is profitable to think that DO2 is a substitutional dopant."
[5] "We anticipate that oxides with a DO2 or a DO dopant will fall into two groups."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The authors state that they have no competing financial interests.
2. The notation DO2 represents the group formed by O2 adsorption on the dopant D, and DO denotes the dopant with an oxygen atom bound to it from the gas phase.
3. If the dopant is not a very strong base, it adsorbs O2 without fully neutralizing its acidity. This allows the adsorbed O2 to react with other Lewis bases.
4. If the dopant is a very strong base, it neutralizes O2's acidity completely, preventing further reactions with Lewis bases. In this scenario, DO2 behaves like a substitutional dopant.
5. The authors predict that oxides with DO2 or DO dopants will belong to two distinct categories based on the strength of the base.

1. 作者声明他们没有竞争性财务利益。
2.DO2表示在掺杂剂D上吸附的O2形成的组，而DO表示从气体中捕获氧原子与之结合的掺杂剂。
3. 如果掺杂剂不是很强的碱，则会吸附O2而不完全中和其酸性。这使得吸附的O2能够与其它Lewis碱反应。
4. 如果掺杂剂是很强的碱，则会完全中和O2的酸性，阻止其与Lewis碱进一步反应。在这种情况下，DO2可以被视为一个置换掺杂剂。
5. 作者预测具有DO2或DO掺杂剂的氧化物将属于两类，具体取决于碱的强度。
