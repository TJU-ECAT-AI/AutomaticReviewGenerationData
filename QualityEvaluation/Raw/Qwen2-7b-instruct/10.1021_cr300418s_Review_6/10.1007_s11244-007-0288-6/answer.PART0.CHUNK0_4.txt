[1] "Focusing on size-selected gold clusters consisting of up to 20 atoms, that is, in the size regime where properties can not be obtained from those of the bulk material through scaling considerations, we summarized in this article the current state of understanding per- taining to various factors that control the reactivity and catalytic activity of such nanostructures, using the CO oxidation reaction catalyzed by the gold nanoclusters adsorbed on MgO as a paradigm."
[2] "Through joined experimental and first-principles quantum mechanical calculations and simulations, a detailed picture of the reaction mechanisms in nanocatalysis, and of methods for controlling and tuning the catalytic activity, emerge."
[3] "The size of the particles which we explore is up to 1 nm in diameter, that is, the size regime in which the electronic, and thus catalytic, properties of the particles cannot be deduced from the bulk behavior through scaling considerations."
[4] "The role of the MgO substrate and its defects, the charge state of the cluster, structural fluxionality of the clusters, electronic size effects, the effect of an underlying metal support on the dimensionality, charging and chemical reactivity of gold nanoclusters adsorbed on the metal-supported ultra-thin metal-oxide films, and the promotional effect of water."

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by allowing us to simulate and study the behavior of these materials at the atomic level. These approaches provide detailed insights into the mechanisms of reaction, the impact of surface defects, charge states, structural flexibility, electronic properties, and the role of supporting substrates. Key considerations involve ensuring accuracy in modeling, optimizing computational efficiency, and exploring new materials. Challenges include accurately representing complex interactions and predicting real-world behavior, while benefits include the ability to screen and optimize catalysts virtually, saving time and resources.
