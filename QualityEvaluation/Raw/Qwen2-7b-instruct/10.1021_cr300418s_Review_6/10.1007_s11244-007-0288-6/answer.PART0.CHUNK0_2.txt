[1] "Understanding the emergent chemical activity of nanoscale gold particles poses a particularly complex challenge in light of the aforementioned inert nature of this metal in the bulk form. It is therefore not surprising that certain attempts to explain some of the more recent observation about Au nanocatalysis through the use of methodologies developed in the course of investigations of the catalytic activity of other noble metals (e.g. Pt), did not lead to conclusive results and/or were not supported by further experiments."
[2] "Aiming at disentangling the factors controlling the reactivity of gold and wishing to gain insights into the microscopic origins of the size-dependent reactivity of gold in the nanoscale regime, we believe that further progress can be achieved through investigations of well-defined model systems."
[3] "Turning our attention to the reaction mechanism, for the CO oxidation reaction on gold clusters supported on MgO films, two main characteristics are notable. The TPR spectra shown in figure 3, were obtained for the CO oxidation reaction catalyzed by Au8 clusters supported on defect-poor and defect-rich MgO films."
[4] "The influence of F-centers on MgO(100) films on the reactivity of gold clusters was studied in more detail by FTIR, using CO that serves here, at the same time, both as reactant and as a probe molecule."
[5] "In the FTIR spectra, shown in figure 5, CO stretch frequencies at 2102 cm−1 and 2077/2049 cm−1 (Au8 on defect-poor and defect-rich films, respectively) are observed as well as a band at 1300 cm−1, which is tentatively attributed to highly activated O2, indicating that both reactants, CO and O2, are adsorbed molecularly at 90 K."
[6] "The question may arise, why the two reaction channels are observed experimentally, since the low-temperature mechanism should be always dominant because its reaction rate is orders of magnitude higher."
[7] "In fact, theoretical studies revealed that only one oxygen molecule adsorbs on the clusters. Thus, there exists an ensemble of Au8 clusters with an oxygen molecule adsorbed on the periphery and another ensemble with the oxygen molecule bound to the top facet."
[8] "The capability of small clusters to exhibit several structural forms (isomers) of comparable energies, and to interconvert between such isomers at finite temperature, is one of the hallmarks of cluster science."
[9] "Understanding the size-dependent electronic structure of the Aun/MgO(FC) model catalysts is fundamental for elucidation of their atom-by-atom controlled reactivity."
[10] "While details of the calculations can be found elsewhere [2,54,56] we take this opportunity to give some pertinent detail."
[11] "In modeling the metal-supported MgO films a four-layer Mo(100) slab (lattice constant of 3.15 Å) of thickness 4.64 Å was used, since it has been found to reproduce (in its middle) the bulk electronic properties of Mo."
[12] "The gas-phase optimal 3D tetrahedral Au20 cluster [64] was found to maintains its structure on the MgO(100) surface, with a 1.2 eV advantage over the planar structure [56] (figure 9)."
[13] "However, this cluster adsorbs O2 only weakly (0.34 eV on the top apex atom of the pyramid with d(OO) = 1.28 Å remaining close to the gas phase value), and no binding was found at peripheral sites of the gold/MgO interface."
[14] "In light of the above inactivity of the 3D structure we focused our investigations on Au20 adsorbed on a two-layer MgO/Mo(100) film."
[15] "Here the planar isomer is more stable then the 3D one by 3.3 eV (see figure 9), with the enhanced stability resulting from penetration of metal states through the thin MO film and charge accumulation at the cluster/MgO interface (up to 1e for Au20) [56]."
[16] "Furthermore, in this configuration the O2 adsorbs relatively strongly (1.35 eV) at the cluster periphery (figure 10), and the process is accompanied by transfer of electronic charge (about 1.3e) into the anti-bonding 2p* orbital leading to activation of the OO bond of the adsorbed molecule into a peroxo state with d(OO) = 1.52 Å and no spin polarization."
[17] "Two mechanisms for the reaction of CO with the activated oxygen molecule were probed. Various CO coadsorption sites were probed."
[18] "For the gold octamer, bound to a defect-free MgO(100) surface, two spatial regions for oxygen adsorption may be identified in the calculations: (i) the top facet of the cluster, where O2 adsorbs weakly (adsorption energies up to 0.1eV), in agreement with [18,27,30] and (ii) peripheral sites (at the Au8/MgO interface), where O2 adsorbs with energies between 0.3 and 0.8 eV (Table 2), with the OO bond extended to 1.37–1.49 Å."
[19] "Moreover, it was found that an adsorbed H2O is an attractor for molecular O2 and in the presence of an adsorbed water molecule O2 preferentially adsorbs at a neighboring site."
[20] "In the case of the Au8/MgO system, results are given for both the adsorption on the top-facet of the gold cluster (-T) and at the peripheral interface of the cluster with the substrate (-P)."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by allowing us to simulate and calculate the electronic structure, reactivity, and interactions of catalysts with reactants and products at the atomic level. Key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical models, the efficiency of computational resources required for large-scale simulations, and the exploration of new catalytic materials through virtual screening. Challenges include the limitations of current theoretical frameworks, the complexity of multi-component systems, and the difficulty in accurately predicting reaction mechanisms. Potential benefits include the ability to optimize catalyst design, understand reaction pathways, and potentially discover novel catalysts that outperform existing materials.

2. The main factors controlling the reactivity and catalytic activity of gold nanostructures in the nanoscale regime include the role of the metal-oxide support and its defects, the charge state of the cluster, structural fluxionality of the clusters, electronic size effects, the effect of an underlying metal support on the dimensionality, charging and chemical reactivity of gold nanoclusters adsorbed on metal-supported ultra-thin metal-oxide films, and the promotional effect of water.

3. The computational methods and models enable researchers to dissect the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on gold clusters supported on MgO films, revealing two main characteristics: the reactivity depends on the number of defects on the support, and two temperature ranges are distinguished, associated with different reaction mechanisms.

4. FTIR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to study the influence of F-centers on the reactivity of gold clusters on MgO films. The CO stretch frequency shifts for the model catalyst on defect-rich films compared to defect-poor films, providing evidence for the existence of high concentration of F-centers on the defect-rich MgO films.

5. The electronic structure of the Au/MgO model catalysts is crucial for understanding their atom-by-atom controlled reactivity. The interaction between the clusters' electronic states and the 2p* molecular states of oxygen enables bonding and activation of O2 at the periphery site of the Au8/MgO(FC) model catalyst.

6. Small clusters exhibit structural dynamical fluxionality, which is essential for the reaction to occur. This dynamic adaptation allows the cluster to interconvert between different structural isomers, influencing the chemical reactivity and facilitating the reaction pathway.

7. Designing the underlying support can tune the catalytic activity of Au nanoclusters. For instance, a very thin (two layers) defect-free MgO film supported on Mo(100) may serve as a model catalyst for the low-barrier oxidation of CO, enabling the emergence of activity by altering the dimensionality and interfacial charge of the gold clusters.

8. The effect of water on the chemical activity of gold clusters was investigated through quantum mechanical ab-initio calculations. The coadsorption of H2O and O2 stabilizes partially charged highly activated states of the adsorbed oxygen molecule, enhancing the reactivity of the gold clusters.

9. The size-dependent electronic structure of Au/MgO(FC) model catalysts is fundamental for elucidating their atom-by-atom controlled reactivity. Resonances formed between the clusters' electronic states and the 2p* molecular states of oxygen enable bonding and activation of O2 at the periphery site of the Au8/MgO(FC) model catalyst.

10. The enhanced stability of the 2D Au20 island on a two-layer MgO/Mo(100) film compared to the 3D structure results from penetration of metal states through the thin MO film and charge accumulation at the cluster/MgO interface. This charge accumulation activates O2 molecules adsorbed at the interfacial periphery of the 2D gold island, lowering the barrier for reaction with CO and emitting CO2.

11. The coadsorption of H2O and O2 on the top facet of the supported gold cluster facilitates a sequence of adsorption and reaction steps that result in the catalytic oxidation of CO, involving proton transfer and a low-energy barrier for CO2 formation.
