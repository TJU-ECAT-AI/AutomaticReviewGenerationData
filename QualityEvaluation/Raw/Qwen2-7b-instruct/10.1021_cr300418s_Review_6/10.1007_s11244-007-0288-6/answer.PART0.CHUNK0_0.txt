1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing a framework to study the electronic structure and reactivity of the catalysts at the atomic level. This allows for the prediction of the electronic transitions, bond strengths, and reaction pathways, which are crucial for understanding how the catalysts interact with alkane molecules. 

2. Key considerations when employing computational methods include the choice of the most suitable computational technique, the accuracy of the exchange-correlation functional, and the reliability of the basis set. Efficiency is also a major concern, especially when dealing with large systems or performing extensive parameter sweeps. The exploration of new catalytic materials can benefit from computational methods by allowing for virtual screening of potential candidates and by guiding experimental efforts towards materials with promising properties.

3. The benefits of using computational methods include their ability to provide insights into the mechanisms of catalytic reactions, to predict the behavior of materials under various conditions, and to aid in the rational design of new catalysts. They can also help in identifying the most effective dopants or modifiers for enhancing the catalytic activity of oxide catalysts.

4. Challenges associated with computational methods include the computational cost, which can limit the size and complexity of the systems that can be studied, and the limitations of current computational models in accurately representing real-world conditions. Additionally, interpreting computational results and ensuring their relevance to experimental observations requires careful validation against experimental data.
