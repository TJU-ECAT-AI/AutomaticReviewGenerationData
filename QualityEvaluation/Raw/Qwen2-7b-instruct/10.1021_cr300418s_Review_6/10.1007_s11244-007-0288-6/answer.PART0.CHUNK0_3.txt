[1] "Understanding the emergent chemical activity of nanoscale gold particles poses a particularly complex challenge in light of the aforementioned inert nature of this metal in the bulk form."
[2] "While significant progress has been achieved in the past several years toward fundamental understanding of the materials and operational factors that govern the catalytic activity of gold nanostructures, much remains to be learned."
[3] "Aiming at disentangling the factors controlling the reactivity of gold and wishing to gain insights into the microscopic origins of the size-dependent reactivity of gold in the nanoscale regime, we believe that further progress can be achieved through investigations of well-defined model systems."
[4] "By integrating the total area in the mass spectra, the total number of CO2 molecules formed per cluster can be plotted vs. the number of atoms per cluster (figure 2(b)). No linear dependence of the reactivity as a function of size can be observed indicating clearly that the number of reactive sites differs for each cluster size."
[5] "Indeed, theoretical studies revealed that only one oxygen molecule adsorbs on the clusters. Thus, there exists an ensemble of Au8 clusters with an oxygen molecule adsorbed on the periphery and another ensemble with the oxygen molecule bound to the top facet."
[6] "The weak binding can be attributed to the narrower d-band of the adsorbed Au4 cluster, compared to that of Au8, with a consequent lack of overlap between the states at the bottom of the d-band of the gold cluster and the molecular oxygen states, with energies E < -5 eV."
[7] "In modeling the metal-supported MgO films a four-layer Mo(100) slab (lattice constant of 3.15 Å) of thickness 4.64 Å was used, since it has been found to reproduce (in its middle) the bulk electronic properties of Mo."
[8] "In all calculations, the periodically replicated slabs were separated [in the (100) direction] by a vacuum region of 20 Å."
[9] "The gas-phase optimal 3D tetrahedral Au20 cluster [64] was found to maintains its structure on the MgO(100) surface, with a 1.2 eV advantage over the planar structure [56] (figure 9)."
[10] "The influence of water (co-)adsorption manifests itself in the calculated change of the oxygen binding energies."

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the electronic and structural properties of the catalysts. They enable us to explore the effects of doping, defect structures, and support materials on the catalytic activity. Key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical models, the efficiency of the computational methods, and the potential for discovering new catalytic materials. Challenges involve the complexity of the models and the computational resources required. Benefits include the ability to screen large numbers of materials and reaction conditions virtually, saving time and resources.

2. The computational methods allow for the detailed investigation of the size-dependent reactivity of gold nanostructures. The models can predict how the properties of the particles differ from those of the bulk material, offering insights into the microscopic origins of their catalytic activity.

3. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling the reactivity of gold nanostructures, further progress can be achieved through the study of well-defined model systems. This includes the use of DFT calculations and simulations to predict the behavior of the catalysts under various conditions.

4. The number of reactive sites varies among different sizes of gold clusters. This indicates that the reactivity is not solely determined by the number of atoms but also by the distribution of active sites within the cluster.

5. The presence of multiple ensembles of gold clusters with oxygen molecules adsorbed in different locations (periphery or top facet) explains the observed reactivity patterns.

6. The weak binding of oxygen to smaller gold clusters (Au4) is attributed to the lack of overlap between the d-band of the cluster and the molecular oxygen states, particularly in the lower energy range.

7. In the modeling of metal-supported MgO films, a four-layer Mo(100) slab was used to accurately represent the bulk electronic properties of the metal, facilitating the study of the interactions between the metal and the oxide film.

8. The separation of the slabs by a vacuum region of 20 Å ensures the validity of the calculations by providing sufficient space to mimic the environment of the catalysts in real conditions.

9. The gas-phase optimal 3D tetrahedral Au20 cluster maintains its structure on the MgO(100) surface, showing a higher stability compared to the planar structure. This indicates the role of dimensionality in affecting the reactivity of gold clusters.

10. The computational studies reveal the impact of water on the oxygen binding energies, suggesting the potential for enhancing catalytic activity through the co-adsorption of water and oxygen molecules.
