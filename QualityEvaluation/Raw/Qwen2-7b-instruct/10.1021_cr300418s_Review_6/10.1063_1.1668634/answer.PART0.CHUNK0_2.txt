1. Density functional theory (DFT) is a quantum mechanical theory utilized in physics, chemistry, and materials science to explore the electronic structure of systems involving multiple particles, primarily atoms, molecules, and condensed phases. Cluster models simplify the intricate interactions within bulk materials by focusing on a limited group of atoms or molecules. Key considerations when employing DFT and cluster models for catalytic materials involve the precision of the exchange-correlation functional, the selection of the basis set, and the level of theory. Challenges associated with these methodologies encompass the computational expense of conducting extensive DFT calculations, the limitations of cluster models in depicting bulk characteristics, and the intricacy in accurately modeling surface chemistry. Potential advantages include the capability to screen vast collections of materials, the potential for high-throughput screening of novel catalysts, and the opportunity to gain insights into the electronic structure that dictates catalytic activity.
