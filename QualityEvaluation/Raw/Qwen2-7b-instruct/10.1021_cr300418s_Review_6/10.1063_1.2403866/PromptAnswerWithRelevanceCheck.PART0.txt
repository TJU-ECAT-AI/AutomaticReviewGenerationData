1. The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT), enable us to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These methods offer significant advantages in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to experimental approaches. However, they also present challenges such as computational cost and the need for accurate input parameters.

2. The key considerations for using DFT and cluster models in this context include the choice of basis set, the level of theory employed, and the representation of exchange-correlation functionals. Efficiency gains come from utilizing approximations and screening techniques, which reduce computational demands while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Potential benefits include the exploration of new catalytic materials and the optimization of existing ones through virtual screening.
