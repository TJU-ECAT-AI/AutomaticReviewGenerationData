Catalysis Letters 2 (1989) 309-318 309 THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE OXIDATIVE COUPLING OF METHANE ON OXIDE/SiO2 CATALYSTS BY TETRACHLOROMETHANE
S. AHMED and J.B. MOFFAT

Although the addition of chlorine or chloromethanes to the feed stream is well documented to have a positive influence on many catalytic processes particularly on the selective oxidation of ethylene [12] and in hydrocarbon reforming processes [13], very little is known on the effects of these additives in methane conversion processes.
In the light of these positive effects of a chloroadditive on the partial oxidation of methane as observed with heteropoly oxometalates in this laboratory we have undertaken an extensive study of the effect of these chlorocompounds on the direct oxidative coupling of methane to higher hydrocarbons using a variety of catalytic materials. In the present communication the result of the addition of a small quantity of tetrachloromethane to the feed on the oxidative dimerization reaction with a number of silica supported metal oxides is reported.

The study reports that the addition of tetrachloromethane to the feed stream during the oxidative coupling of methane enhances the yield and selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons on certain silica-supported metal oxides, specifically Ba, Cs, and Mn oxides. This enhancement is attributed to the modification of the oxide surface by the chloroadditive, possibly altering the acidity/basicity, incorporation of chlorine into the oxide, the strength of metal-chlorine bonds, or the ability of the oxide surface to decompose the chloromethane and form chlorine radicals.

本研究报道，在一定量的四氯化碳添加到反应流中时，通过多种二氧化硅支持的金属氧化物进行甲烷直接氧化二聚反应，显著提高了C2烃类产物的产率和选择性，特别是在钡、铯和锰氧化物上。这种增强归因于氯化物添加剂对氧化物表面的改性，可能涉及酸碱性的改变、氯原子的引入到氧化物中、金属-氯键的强度或氧化物表面分解四氯化碳并形成氯自由基的能力。
