Catalysis Letters 2 (1989) 309-318 309 THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE OXIDATIVE COUPLING OF METHANE ON OXIDE/SiO2 CATALYSTS BY TETRACHLOROMETHANE
S. AHMED and J.B. MOFFAT

Although the addition of chlorine or chloromethanes to the feed stream is well documented to have a positive influence on many catalytic processes particularly on the selective oxidation of ethylene [12] and in hydrocarbon reforming processes [13], very little is known on the effects of these additives in methane conversion processes.
In the light of these positive effects of a chloroadditive on the partial oxidation of methane as observed with heteropoly oxometalates in this laboratory we have undertaken an extensive study of the effect of these chlorocompounds on the direct oxidative coupling of methane to higher hydrocarbons using a variety of catalytic materials. In the present communication the result of the addition of a small quantity of tetrachloromethane to the feed on the oxidative dimerization reaction with a number of silica supported metal oxides is reported.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study reports that the addition of tetrachloromethane to the feed stream during the oxidative coupling of methane enhances the yield and selectivity of C2 hydrocarbons on certain silica-supported metal oxides, specifically Ba, Cs, and Mn oxides. This enhancement is attributed to the modification of the oxide surface by the chloroadditive, possibly altering the acidity/basicity, incorporation of chlorine into the oxide, the strength of metal-chlorine bonds, or the ability of the oxide surface to decompose the chloromethane and form chlorine radicals.

本研究报道，在一定量的四氯化碳添加到反应流中时，通过多种二氧化硅支持的金属氧化物进行甲烷直接氧化二聚反应，显著提高了C2烃类产物的产率和选择性，特别是在钡、铯和锰氧化物上。这种增强归因于氯化物添加剂对氧化物表面的改性，可能涉及酸碱性的改变、氯原子的引入到氧化物中、金属-氯键的强度或氧化物表面分解四氯化碳并形成氯自由基的能力。

[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."
[2] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[3] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[4] "In fact, at high temperatures, chlorine radicals have been shown to catalyze formations of C2H4 from CH4 in the gas phase [20,21]."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of a small amount of chloromethane, specifically tetrachloromethane (CC14), to the feed stream can significantly enhance the conversion of methane and the selectivity towards the formation of C2 hydrocarbons on certain oxide catalysts, including those of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn) supported on silica. This enhancement is observed when the catalysts are used in the oxidative coupling of methane to produce ethane and ethylene. The presence of CC14 modifies the oxide surface in ways that facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation of methane, leading to increased yields of C2 hydrocarbons. However, the effect of CC14 varies depending on the specific type of oxide catalyst used. For instance, in the presence of CC14, the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 tends to increase, suggesting that halogen radicals supplied by CC14 catalyze the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. This process may involve the formation of C2H4 not only directly from methane but also through the oxidation of chloromethane (CH3C1) formed in the reaction.

在我们的最近研究中，在硅酸盐支持的杂多酸氧化物上使用硝酸氧化甲烷，表明向反应流体中添加少量二氯甲烷或四氯化碳对甲烷的转化和不同产物的选择性产生了深远影响。当使用包括钡（Ba）、铯（Cs）和锰（Mn）在内的氧化物催化剂时，向这些氧化物上添加四氯化碳显著提高了由甲烷氧化脱氢生成C2烃类的转化率和选择性。这种增强作用在巴、铯和锰基氧化物支持下表现明显，尤其是在乙烷和乙烯的形成过程中。四氯化碳的存在通过改变氧化物表面的方式促进了甲烷的氧化脱氢，从而导致C2烃类产量的增加。然而，四氯化碳的影响取决于所使用的氧化物催化剂的类型。例如，在四氯化碳存在的情况下，C2H4与C2H6的比例趋于增加，这表明四氯化碳提供的卤素自由基催化了C2H6转化为C2H4的过程。这一过程可能不仅直接从甲烷产生C2H4，而且也涉及氯代甲烷（CH3C1）的氧化。

Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction. Over Cs, however, this increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is not maintained with further process time. On Ba/SiO2 a large increase in the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbon in the initial periods of reaction is observed as well.
At the present stage, very little can be said about the mechanism of the reaction. The fact that an increase in oxygen concentration increases the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 appears to indicate as suggested by others in the absence of CCI4 [5,10,19], that C2H6 is the primary C2 product and C2H4 is produced by the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6. The relatively high ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 observed in the presence of CC14 in the feed suggests that halogen radicals supplied from CC14 are catalyzing the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4.

The enhancement of the oxidative coupling of methane on oxide/SiO2 catalysts by tetrachloromethane is shown to alter both the conversion and selectivity, but notably with oxides of Ba, Cs, and Mn produces remarkable increases in the yield and selectivity to C2H4 and C2H6, particularly the former. The mechanism of the reaction involves the presence of halogen radicals supplied from CC14 catalyzing the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. The increase in the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 in the presence of CC14 suggests that the halogen radicals are involved in this process. Over Ba/SiO2 and Cs/SiO2, a substantial increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is noted in the initial hours of reaction, but this increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is not maintained with further process time over Cs. On Ba/SiO2, a large increase in the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbon in the initial periods of reaction is observed.

在氧化耦合甲烷到更高碳氢化合物的过程中，通过在氧化物/SiO2催化剂上引入四氯化碳，转化率和选择性均有所改变，但尤其是Ba、Cs和Mn氧化物，显著提高了C2H4和C2H6的产率和选择性，特别是前者。反应机制表明，从CC14提供的卤素自由基催化了C2H6转化为C2H4的过程。在CC14存在的条件下，C2H4与C2H6的比例较高，表明卤素自由基参与了这一过程。对于Ba/SiO2和Cs/SiO2，在反应初期，C2产物的产率显著增加，但在Cs中，随着反应时间的延长，这种C2产物产率的增加并未保持。在Ba/SiO2上，反应初期观察到了C2产物选择性的显著提高。向反应流中加入四氯化碳对甲烷转化和不同产品的选择性产生了深远的影响。
