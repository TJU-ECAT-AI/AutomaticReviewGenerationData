The introduction of carbon tetrachloride to the feed stream in the conversion of methane to hydrocarbons over a variety of silica-supported oxides is shown to alter both the conversion and selectivity, but notably with oxides of Ba, Cs, and Mn produces remarkable increases in the yield and selectivity to C2H4 and C2H6, particularly the former.
