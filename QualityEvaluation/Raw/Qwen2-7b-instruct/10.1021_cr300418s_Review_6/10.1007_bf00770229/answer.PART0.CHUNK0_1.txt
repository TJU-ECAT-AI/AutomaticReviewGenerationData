[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."
[2] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CC14 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."
[3] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."
[4] "In fact, at high temperatures, chlorine radicals have been shown to catalyze formations of C2H4 from CH4 in the gas phase [20,21]."

The addition of a small amount of chloromethane, specifically tetrachloromethane (CC14), to the feed stream can significantly enhance the conversion of methane and the selectivity towards the formation of C2 hydrocarbons on certain oxide catalysts, including those of barium (Ba), cesium (Cs), and manganese (Mn) supported on silica. This enhancement is observed when the catalysts are used in the oxidative coupling of methane to produce ethane and ethylene. The presence of CC14 modifies the oxide surface in ways that facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation of methane, leading to increased yields of C2 hydrocarbons. However, the effect of CC14 varies depending on the specific type of oxide catalyst used. For instance, in the presence of CC14, the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 tends to increase, suggesting that halogen radicals supplied by CC14 catalyze the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. This process may involve the formation of C2H4 not only directly from methane but also through the oxidation of chloromethane (CH3C1) formed in the reaction.

在我们的最近研究中，在硅酸盐支持的杂多酸氧化物上使用硝酸氧化甲烷，表明向反应流体中添加少量二氯甲烷或四氯化碳对甲烷的转化和不同产物的选择性产生了深远影响。当使用包括钡（Ba）、铯（Cs）和锰（Mn）在内的氧化物催化剂时，向这些氧化物上添加四氯化碳显著提高了由甲烷氧化脱氢生成C2烃类的转化率和选择性。这种增强作用在巴、铯和锰基氧化物支持下表现明显，尤其是在乙烷和乙烯的形成过程中。四氯化碳的存在通过改变氧化物表面的方式促进了甲烷的氧化脱氢，从而导致C2烃类产量的增加。然而，四氯化碳的影响取决于所使用的氧化物催化剂的类型。例如，在四氯化碳存在的情况下，C2H4与C2H6的比例趋于增加，这表明四氯化碳提供的卤素自由基催化了C2H6转化为C2H4的过程。这一过程可能不仅直接从甲烷产生C2H4，而且也涉及氯代甲烷（CH3C1）的氧化。
