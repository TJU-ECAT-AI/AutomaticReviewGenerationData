8.2.1 Potential Energy Curves
Obtaining potential energy curves of interacting systems represents the simplest technique for analyzing the dependence of an interaction on geometric parameters. These curves are generated in one dimension along some particular geometric coordinate, usually in the direction of direct complex dissociation.
8.2.2 Analytical Gradients
Analytic gradient geometry optimizations on a large set of hydrogen-bonded complexes using the CCSD(T) method along with a basis set in which non-hydrogen atoms are described using the aug-cc-pVQZ basis and hydrogens are described using cc-pVQZ (referred to as the AVQZ basis).
8.2.3 Conformations of Peptides
In the case of intermolecular complexes the BSSE can effectively be eliminated (or at least strongly reduced) for most computational methods by using the counterpoise technique.

1. Potential energy curves are used to analyze the dependence of an interaction on geometric parameters. They are typically generated along a specific geometric coordinate, such as the direction of direct complex dissociation.
2. Analytic gradient geometry optimizations on hydrogen-bonded complexes can be carried out using the CCSD(T) method with a basis set that distinguishes between non-hydrogen atoms and hydrogens.
3. The counterpoise technique can eliminate or significantly reduce the basis set superposition error (BSSE) in intermolecular complexes for most computational methods.
