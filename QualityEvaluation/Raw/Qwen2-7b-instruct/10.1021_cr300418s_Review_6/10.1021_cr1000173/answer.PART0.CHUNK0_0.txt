<p>Noncovalent interactions are playing a central role in both bio- and nanostructures. All life on our earth can be viewed as an application of supramolecular chemistry with noncovalent interactions playing a central role. Biomacromolecules, DNA, RNA, and proteins, all play a dominant role in our life. The function of these biomacromolecules is to a large extent determined by their structures, so forming a deep understanding of the nature of the stabilization of these systems is thus of key importance.</p>
<p>For a long time it was believed that H-bonding was much stronger than stacking, and consequently, it was expected that H-bonding was the key player in determining biomolecular structure. At the time, the role of stacking was, in fact, not completely clear. Accurate quantum mechanical (QM) calculations performed in the past few years in our laboratory (3, 4) have, surprisingly, shown that the stabilization of both motifs can in fact be comparable.</p>
<p>The development of faster QM procedures is highly important since we need to describe larger and larger fragments of bio- and nanostructures as accurately as possible. It is especially clear that interactions within these systems are governed not only by classical short- and long-range interactions, which can be basically described by EPs, but also by effects that are clearly of quantum origin, for which EP-based methods fail. Among quantum effects that must be considered, probably the most important are charge-transfer phenomena, which are especially significant in biological processes with the participation of metals or electron donor and electron acceptor subsystems. Fast and accurate QM methods are also needed in molecular dynamic simulations where the description of quantum effects plays a decisive role.</p>
<p>Among the most important noncovalent interaction types are hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) and stacking; these motifs are found not only in nucleic acids and proteins, but also in complexes of nucleic acids and proteins with ligands. For a long time it was believed that H-bonding was much stronger than stacking, and consequently, it was expected that H-bonding was the key player in determining biomolecular structure. At the time, the role of stacking was, in fact, not completely clear.</p>
<p>Accurate evaluation of the former energy contribution is straightforward, and almost any QM level describes H-bonding properly. It is an entirely different situation for the stacking interactions, where the most accurate QM calculations covering a large portion of the correlation energy combined with extended AO basis sets are required.</p>
<p>The very unique position of the CCSD(T)/CBS technique follows from the fact that it is the only theoretical ab initio procedure (in the sense that no empirical data are utilized) that provides accurate stabilization energies for various types of noncovalent complexes. All other WFT, DFT, and EP procedures contain one or more parameters that were most likely fitted toward the CCSD(T)/CBS or experimental data.</p>
<p>However, the development of faster QM procedures is highly important since we need to describe larger and larger fragments of bio- and nanostructures as accurately as possible. It is especially clear that interactions within these systems are governed not only by classical short- and long-range interactions, which can be basically described by EPs, but also by effects that are clearly of quantum origin, for which EP-based methods fail.

Fast and accurate QM methods are also needed in molecular dynamic simulations where the description of quantum effects plays a decisive role.</p>
<p>The most widely used method, without doubt, is MP2, which covers the essential portion of the correlation energy and is still feasible even for complexes having more than 100 atoms. The main drawbacks of this method are the heavy dependence on the basis set as well as on the geometry of the complex. The limitations of the method will be discussed together with suggestions about how to overcome them.</p>
<p>The section on DFT should start with a brief discussion of the limitations of standard DFT functionals in the description of noncovalent interactions. Successes and failures of DFT in studies of H-bonded and stacked structures will be demonstrated on DNA base pairs and amino acid pairs. The hereditary sin of DFT, a failure to describe the dispersion energy, can be overcome in several different ways, which will be discussed at the beginning of the DFT paragraph.</p>
<p>A very promising approach entails a combination of DFT-D (dispersion energy corrected) with a GGA functional and a medium basis set. This procedure is fast and can even be used in on-the-fly ab initio (DFT-D) molecular dynamics simulations. This technique is a very promising tool for studies of the dynamic properties of small and medium noncovalent complexes.</p>
<p>Generally, semiempirical QM procedures are known not to be suitable for calculations on noncovalent interactions, with the main problem being, again, the deficiency in the description of the dispersion energy. However, if this energy term is added (in a way similar to that in DFT-D), the semiempirical QM procedures can be successfully used even in the realms of noncovalent interactions. The main attention will be paid to the PM6 method, belonging to the family of semiempirical NDDO methods; the PM6 method represents the most recent parametrization of the well-known series of PMx methods.</p>
<p>Approximate MP2 schemes have been quite successful in reducing the computational scaling of the MP2 method. The main drawbacks of these methods are their strong dependence on the basis set and the fact that they are not based on solid theoretical foundations. However, they are very fast and can be applied to complexes with sizes of several hundred atoms.</p>
<p>Another route to approximated coupled-cluster methods for large systems is represented by the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) (71) based CCSD(T) and divide-and-conquer (DC) (81) based CCSD methods. Common to these (and other related) approaches is the fact that it is unnecessary to use localized orbitals. Near linear scaling is achieved by either explicit calculation of only the (capped or isolated) monomer fragments and their respective dimers and trimers in the electrostatic field of the whole system (FMO) or by assembling the total one-electron density, which is calculated locally (DC).</p>
<p>To date the majority of efforts to reduce the scaling of the correlated WFT calculations have been invested in methods with lower order scaling than CCSD(T), mostly on HF and MP2 (see further text). Still, attempts to exploit the inherent short-range nature of electronelectron correlation in CC theory have been pursued by Werner and co-workers, (54-57) Dolg and co-workers, (58-60) Auer and Noojien, (61) Scuseria and Ayala, (62) Bartlett and co-workers, (63-65) Head-Gordon and co-workers, (66-68) and others. (69-73)</p>

<p>The limitations of standard DFT functionals in the description of noncovalent interactions have been overcome in several different ways. Two approaches, the addition of an empirical dispersion energy term combined with parametrization of the damping function and the de novo parametrization of the DFT functional, have become by far the most successful and will be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>The availability of accurate reference data contributed a great deal to this development. Substantial improvements have lately been achieved in alternative paradigms for accurate calculations not requiring the introduction of any empirical parameter, such as symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), and especially its DFT approximation called DFT-SAPT or SAPT/DFT, and the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) procedure.</p>
<p>In the current review we encompass the recent developments in this field, facilitate orientation among the quickly appearing treatments, and emphasize the vital importance of accurate reference calculations. In the past five years we have published about 100 papers covering the subject of the current review, and these papers, together with literature references, will make the base of the present review.</p>
<p>Due to the unfavorable scaling of the CCSD(T) method (roughly with the seventh power of the system size), its applicability is limited to complexes with no more than about 50 atoms. It is thus highly topical to investigate the performance of other WFT procedures that can be applied for larger complexes.</p>
