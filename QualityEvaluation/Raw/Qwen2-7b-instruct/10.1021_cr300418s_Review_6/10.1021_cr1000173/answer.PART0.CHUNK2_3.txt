[1] "Among the methods tested, MP2, as might be expected, proved to give the best values for all H-bond properties considered in the study. Among the DFT methods the best results for all of the H-bond properties were obtained using the hybrid functionals, B3LYP and B97-1, with B3LYP giving the best results."
[2] "The performances of several methods, MP2, SCS-CCSD, SCS-MP2, SCSN-MP2, SCS(MI)-MP2, M05-2X, M06-2X, B3LYP-D, and PBE-D, were evaluated relative to the new benchmark data."
[3] "In terms of potential energy curves, it was observed that the MP2 technique, when combined with the medium aug-cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets, produces semiquantitatively accurate results."
[4] "The three techniques mentioned above are all quite computationally intensive and generally cannot be used for systems containing more than 5080 atoms (and even fewer if geometry optimizations are to be done or if it is necessary to study large numbers of structures for the generation of potential energy curves)."
[5] "The DFT-D method (when used with basis sets of triple-ζ quality) can be recommended for geometry optimizations and for generating potential energy curves."
[6] "In terms of lower level methods, which can be used for computations on larger systems, the DFT-D method can be recommended for geometry optimizations and for generating potential energy curves."

1. Among the methods tested, MP2 provided the best results for hydrogen bond properties, with hybrid functionals (B3LYP and B97-1) offering the best outcomes among DFT methods, with B3LYP being superior.
2. Multiple methods, including MP2, SCS-CCSD, SCS-MP2, SCSN-MP2, SCS(MI)-MP2, M05-2X, M06-2X, B3LYP-D, and PBE-D were assessed against new benchmark data.
3. MP2, when combined with medium aug-cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets, showed semiquantitative accuracy in potential energy curve computations.
4. The three aforementioned techniques were computationally demanding and not suitable for systems exceeding 50-80 atoms, or requiring geometry optimizations or large-scale structure studies.
5. The DFT-D method, when paired with triple-ζ quality basis sets, was recommended for geometry optimizations and potential energy curve generation.
6. For larger systems, the DFT-D method could be used for geometry optimizations and potential energy curve calculations.
