[1] "In the past 10 years, an unusually large number of new QM approaches have emerged, in both the WFT and DFT families (references will be given in the subsequent paragraphs)."

[2] "The MP2 procedure, when combined with an extended AO basis set (or even when performed at the CBS limit), basically provides reliable data for H-bonding, but generally overestimates the stacking interactions (by as much as several kilocalories per mole)."

[3] "Among the most important noncovalent interaction types are hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) and stacking; these motifs are found not only in nucleic acids and proteins, but also in complexes of nucleic acids and proteins with ligands."

[4] "The very unique position of the CCSD(T)/CBS technique follows from the fact that it is the only theoretical ab initio procedure (in the sense that no empirical data are utilized) that provides accurate stabilization energies for various types of noncovalent complexes."

[5] "Among the most important noncovalent interaction types are hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) and stacking; these motifs are found not only in nucleic acids and proteins, but also in complexes of nucleic acids and proteins with ligands."

[6] "The development of faster QM procedures is highly important since we need to describe larger and larger fragments of bio- and nanostructures as accurately as possible."

[7] "The reason for such an interest, or more generally, why are noncovalent interactions so relevant in modern research? Is it the mere existence of noncovalent complexes in the gas and liquid phases?"

[8] "For a long time it was believed that H-bonding was much stronger than stacking, and consequently, it was expected that H-bonding was the key player in determining biomolecular structure."

[9] "The role that noncovalent interactions are playing in both bio- and nanostructures."

[10] "The accuracy of the CCSD(T) procedure for nanostructures and their models can be, however, questioned since upon delocalization of the systems (e.g., graphene) the HOMOLUMO gap decreases and the use of perturbation methods (for evaluation of triple excitations) is no longer justified."
