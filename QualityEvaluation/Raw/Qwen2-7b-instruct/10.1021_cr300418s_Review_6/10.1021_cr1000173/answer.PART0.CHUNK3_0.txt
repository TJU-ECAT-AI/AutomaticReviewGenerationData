Noncovalent interactions play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) offers a robust framework for predicting the behavior of these systems, especially when combined with cluster models that focus on the local environment around dopants. Computational methods, including DFT, enable the prediction of reaction pathways, energy barriers, and the effects of noncovalent interactions on catalytic performance. The choice of basis set and functional in DFT calculations is critical for accuracy, with hybrid functionals often providing superior descriptions of noncovalent interactions. Empirical corrections, such as the Grimme dispersion correction, can enhance the efficiency of computational methods. These tools are essential for screening and designing new catalytic materials, allowing for the optimization of their properties and activities. The key considerations include choosing appropriate computational methods, accurately modeling noncovalent interactions, and efficiently utilizing computational resources.
