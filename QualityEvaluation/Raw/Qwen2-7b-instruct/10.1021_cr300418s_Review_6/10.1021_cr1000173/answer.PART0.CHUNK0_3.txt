[1] "The situation in calculations of noncovalent interactions at that time can be best characterized by the question we posed at the very beginning of the review: Can quantum chemistry describe vdW (van der Waals; today we call it noncovalent) interactions as successfully as covalent interactions?"
[2] "The reason for such an interest, or more generally, why are noncovalent interactions so relevant in modern research? Is it the mere existence of noncovalent complexes in the gas and liquid phases? Certainly not. The answer should be sought in the role that noncovalent interactions are playing in both bio- and nanostructures."
[3] "The very unique position of the CCSD(T)/CBS technique follows from the fact that it is the only theoretical ab initio procedure (in the sense that no empirical data are utilized) that provides accurate stabilization energies for various types of noncovalent complexes."
[4] "The development of faster QM procedures is highly important since we need to describe larger and larger fragments of bio- and nanostructures as accurately as possible."

1. The review discusses the historical context of noncovalent interaction calculations, emphasizing the question of whether quantum chemistry can describe these interactions as effectively as covalent ones. It suggests that the interest in noncovalent interactions stems from their roles in biological and nanoscale systems.

2. The relevance of noncovalent interactions in modern research is attributed to their importance in biological processes and nanotechnology, rather than just their presence in gases and liquids. 

3. The CCSD(T)/CBS method is highlighted for its unique capability to provide accurate energy values for various noncovalent complexes, distinguishing it from other quantum mechanical approaches.

4. There is a strong need for the development of faster quantum mechanical methods to accurately model larger biological and nanoscale structures.

1. 本文回顾了非共价相互作用计算的历史背景，强调了量子化学能否像描述共价键那样有效地描述这些相互作用的问题。它指出，研究中对非共价相互作用的关注，更多地是因为它们在生物和纳米系统中的作用，而不仅仅是因为它们存在于气体和液体中。

2. 非共价相互作用在现代研究中的相关性，主要归因于它们在生物学过程和纳米技术中的重要性，而不是仅仅因为它们存在于气体和液体中。

3. CCSD(T)/CBS方法因其唯一能够为各种非共价复合物提供准确的能量值的能力而突出，这与其它量子力学方法不同。

4. 对于更准确地模拟更大生物和纳米尺度结构的需求，迫切需要发展更快的量子力学方法。
