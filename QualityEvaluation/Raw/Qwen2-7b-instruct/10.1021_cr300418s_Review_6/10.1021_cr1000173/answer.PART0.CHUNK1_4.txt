[1] "At the equilibrium geometries, damping takes off roughly around 15% of the dispersion contribution in the case of dispersion-bonded complexes, but up to 90% in the case of the hydrogen-bonded complexes."
[2] "This means that the balance between complexes with different interaction types is very sensitive to the extent of damping."
[3] "In our experience, the overall behavior of damping and even the total dispersion contribution are more sensitive to the radius scaling than to the C6 scaling (s6), introduced by Grimme, (135) in the sense that a small variation in sR brings larger changes than the same variation in s6."
[4] "The above discussion may not apply to the DFT functionals reparametrized with dispersion included in the process, (210) where the functional form and the damping function steepness are interdependent."

1. At equilibrium, damping removes approximately 15% of the dispersion contribution in dispersion-bonded complexes, whereas it can remove up to 90% in hydrogen-bonded complexes. 
2. The balance between complexes with various interaction types is highly sensitive to the degree of damping.
3. Our experience indicates that the behavior of damping and even the total dispersion contribution are more sensitive to the radius scaling than to the C6 scaling introduced by Grimme, with minor alterations in sR causing greater variations than similar adjustments in s6.
4. The relationship between functional form and damping steepness may differ when dispersion is reparametrized within the DFT process, affecting how these elements interact.

1. 在平衡几何构型下，消散在结合力较弱的复合物中大约去除15%的色散贡献，而在氢键结合的复合物中可以达到90%。
2. 各种相互作用类型的平衡非常敏感于消散的程度。
3. 我们的经验表明，消散行为和甚至总色散贡献对半径缩放比对格里姆引入的C6缩放（s6）更为敏感，轻微变化sR带来的变化大于相同变化s6带来的影响。
4. 当使用包含色散的重新参数化过程进行DFT时，功能形式与消散陡度之间的关系可能不同，这影响了这些元素的交互方式。
