Proper damping is a crucial part of a transferable and general DFT-D approach. At the equilibrium geometries, damping takes off roughly around 15% of the dispersion contribution in the case of dispersion-bonded complexes, but up to 90% in the case of the hydrogen-bonded complexes. This means that the balance between complexes with different interaction types is very sensitive to the extent of damping. The extent of damping is determined mainly by the distance at which damping takes effect, which is given by the vdW radii and their scaling factor (if they are scaled). Therefore, a good choice of the vdW radii and/or the radius scaling factors (sR) is very important. In our experience, the overall behavior of damping and even the total dispersion contribution are more sensitive to the radius scaling than to the C6 scaling (s6), introduced by Grimme, (135) in the sense that a small variation in sR brings larger changes than the same variation in s6. The shape of the damping function is also important. Damping functions that are too flat in connection with standard DFT functionals (i.e., functionals which are not reparametrized for use with the ED correction) lead to marked overestimation of the interaction in hydrogen-bonded complexes with respect to the dispersion-bonded complexes (ΔΔDH in ref 136). This is also the reason why a theoretically sound, but very flat, Tang and Toennies (188, 189) damping function cannot perform well in the DFT-D schemes. A steeper damping function gives overall better results, although it may not be efficient enough in avoiding double counting at intermediate distances. In this respect, a damping function that is very steep at short distances and rather flat at intermediate and long distances works much better. (207) The above discussion may not apply to the DFT functionals reparametrized with dispersion included in the process, (210) where the functional form and the damping function steepness are interdependent.
4.2.2 Intramolecular Dispersion
The atomic dispersion scheme of course predicts some intramolecular dispersion contribution for larger molecules. There are, however, some disputes as to whether this is desirable. In the intermolecular perturbation theory one molecule is treated as a whole; there is just one molecular polarizability, and the intramolecular contribution to dispersion is by definition zero. Therefore, the intermolecular perturbation theory cannot give us any answer regarding the intramolecular dispersion. This, however, does not mean that there is no such effect. Grimme et al. showed that at the LMP2 level the intramolecular and intermolecular long-range correlations have similar magnitudes in comparable cases. (211) DFT-D calculations on larger molecules, such as polypeptides, show that if the intramolecular dispersion is not included, the energy ordering of conformers is wrong, but after inclusion of the dispersion correction it becomes much better. (78, 212-214) In some cases a PES without the intramolecular dispersion is so inaccurate that the global minimum cannot even be located. (78, 212-215) This all points to the conclusion that inclusion of the intramolecular dispersion correction is not only useful, but probably also theoretically sound.
4.2.3 Beyond the C6 Term
It is well-known that the higher order terms in the perturbation expansion contribute quite a large portion of the total dispersion energy, often between 20% and 30%. (216, 217) Knowing this, it seems rather surprising that the most common empirical dispersion schemes perform so well. It is likely that this can be, to a large extent, explained by the empirical character of the C6 coefficients and the damping function, which can buffer the errors due to the missing higher order contributions. Depending on the set of C6 parameters and the scaling scheme chosen, the missing dispersion can be compensated for either by up-scaling the C6 parameters or by down-scaling the vdW radii or both. Either option is undesirable, but the first one, up-scaling the C6 parameters, is probably the least appropriate. This would affect the long-range dispersion, which might bring overestimation of the long-range attraction in the condensed phase, where the long-range contributions add up because of the increasing relative count of long-range contacts. Note that none of the current empirical dispersion methods considered the condensed phase in the fitting procedure. Inclusion of higher order dispersion coefficients does somewhat improve the overall DFT-D results. (207) Another possible problem arises from the neglect of the dispersion anisotropy. Dispersion anisotropy may be very large in common molecules; for instance, in base pair dimers the C6 coefficients can vary by a factor of 23 depending on the direction of the interaction. (218) However, it is still not clear what part of this anisotropy can be accounted for by the atoms-in-molecules approach used in DFT-D. Recently, Krishtal et al. suggested that, when anisotropy is taken into account, there is no need for the damping function, (219) but this conclusion was based on calculations on rather small complexes, and in our opinion, it needs more testing on larger molecules. In conclusion, the current simple dispersion corrections omit certain, perhaps important, contributions to the dispersion energy. Nontheless, they provide dispersion energies that are quite accurate, which can be explained either by error cancellation or by the small importance of the missing components.
4.2.4 Semiempirical Dispersion Correction Based on the Exchange Hole Dipole Moment
The dispersion correction method by Becke and Johnson partially falls into the category of empirical dispersion corrections to DFT; only in this case the dispersion coefficients (C6, C8, C10) are determined with major nonempirical input. (220-225) The damping function remains empirical. In 2005 Becke and Johnson (220) suggested a heuristic formula (revisited in a more rigorous fashion in 2007) (223) to calculate dispersion coefficients from the exchange hole dipole moment (the XDM model). In this way the C6 coefficients of the atoms within the molecules can be calculated from the KohnSham orbitals (220) or only the density properties, (221) with the only empirical input being the polarizabilities of the free atoms. Later Johnson and Becke suggested a damping function for use in the overlap distances (224) and extended the formalism to the higher dispersion coefficients. (222) For further discussion of the XDM model see the work by Angyan (226) and Hesselmann. (227) Surprisingly, the calculated dispersion coefficients are rather accurate, and tests on a set of small molecules showed fairly good results. (225) In this respect the Johnson and Becke method is very promising. However, as we discussed in our paper, (136) the accuracy of the DFT-D scheme critically depends on the parametrization of the damping function. The damping used in the Johnson and Becke approach is not optimized, and in our opinion, even better results could be achieved with a more flexible damping function. This would be necessary if XDM were to be combined with different XC functionals. (136) In 2007 the authors combined the dispersion term with their XC functional in a unified DF07 functional for dynamical, nondynamical, and dispersion correlations. (228) In 2009 Kong et al. derived and implemented the self-consistent XDM model and showed that the differences with respect to the non-self-consistent XDM model are rather small. (186) Overall it seems that the XDM method has the potential to become a very accurate DFT plus dispersion method.
4.3 Dispersion Correction in the Plane Wave Codes and Nonlocal Pseudopotentials
An interesting way of explicitly accounting for dispersion forces in DFT was suggested by Lilienfeld, Tavernelli, and Rothlisberger. (229) The method is based on the pseudopotentials, and it is called DCACP, dispersion-corrected atom-centered potential. While in the DFT-D scheme the dispersion attractions are modeled as attractions between atom-centered points, in DCACP the attraction comes from an additional artificial potential that acts between electrons and nuclei. This effective atom-centered potential is optimized to reproduce the reference interaction energy, including dispersion. In this sense the DCACP method is empirical. An advantage is that the electron density reflects the dispersion contribution, unlike in the perturbative approaches. A disadvantage is that the method is useful only when pseudopotentials are applied, for instance, in the PW calculations. The current versions of DCACP (DCACP-MP2 and the newer DCACP-CCSD(T)) use single-channel expansion. This is enough to reproduce intermolecular potentials at the typical vdW distances, i.e., at separations smaller than ca. 5 Å, but it does not exhibit the correct asymptotic behavior (1/R6). (230, 231) For correct asymptotics more channels should be used. (232) Therefore, these corrections can be very useful for correcting the major problems of DFT at the typical vdW distances, but may prove problematic when the long-range part of dispersion is non-negligible, which is often the case in solution. It is not clear whether this approach has any advantage over the conceptually simpler and, in the long range, more physical, empirical dispersion correction.
4.4 Reparametrization of Current Density Functionals
The idea of improving the performance of current density functionals for vdW interactions by adjusting their parameters, while keeping the present form, is very compelling. Most of the widely used density functionals, such as B3LYP, BLYP, PBE, PW91, etc., were designed or parametrized without regard for noncovalent interactions. It is therefore not impossible that slight parameter readjustments could lower the errors for the van der Waals complexes. Of course, we cannot forget that the LDA, GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals do not provide the desired 1/R6 asymptotic behavior, and any improvements can be expected only when the electron densities of the interacting molecules overlap. Still, in most situations we are interested in the interacting molecules in close contactat the vdW distance or not very far from the vdW minimum. In such situations the electron overlap is quite appreciable. In addition, the magnitude of the correlation-related error (the missing attraction) usually reaches its maximum around the vdW distance (the contribution coming solely from the nonoverlap distances is relatively small). (136) It is easy to imagine that a suitably modified functional might provide enough additional attraction in this region, which could simulate the effect of the missing long-range correlation. However, we have to keep in mind that this attraction will most likely be spurious and we will be getting the almost right answer for the wrong reason. One of the other things to worry about is the quality of the resulting self-consistent electron density and especially its part originating in the long-range fluctuations. Still, if we could extend the applicability of the computationally efficient functionals of today to the overlap distances, it would be extremely helpful.
Many researchers have followed this idea with some success. (233-238) The ad hoc BH&H functional of Becke (239) has been shown to perform relatively well for the stacked complexes of DNA bases, but to overestimate the hydrogen-bonded complexes. (233) For a long time this unbalanced description of the dispersion-bonded and hydrogen-bonded complexes seemed to be a characteristic of the functional reparametrization attempts. (235, 239) The X3LYP functional, (234) which was especially designed for noncovalent interactions, failed to describe binding in these complexes qualitatively, demonstrating that parametrization and testing on rare-gas atoms do not guarantee reasonable performance for larger molecules. (182) Similarly, the TPSS and TPSSh functionals, which perform well for the rare-gas dimers, fail for the larger molecules. (136) Recently, the focused efforts of Zhao and Truhlar, who have published a number of papers on empirical parametrization over the past few years, have led to functionals performing very well for a very wide variety of complexes. (237, 238, 240) The authors used various types of reference data in the fitting procedure, including the interaction energies of noncovalent complexes, barrier heights, atomization energies, ionization potentials, etc. Their effort peaked in 2008 with the M06 (185) suite of functionals (which comprises four different functionals with different areas of application) as well as the M08-HX and M08-SO (241) density functionals. For calculations on noncovalent complexes the authors recommend the M06-2X functional. It should be noted that the M06 functionals are very sensitive to the integration grid sparseness, thanks to the functional form of their kinetic energy density terms. (242) With the regularly used grids M06 functionals exhibit oscillations and sometimes multiple minima on the potentials of weakly bonded complexes, so the use of ultrafine grids is recommended. This slows calculations significantly and somewhat lowers the advantage of the M06 suite with respect to the more demanding nonlocal DFT approaches (see below). Also, the long-range behavior of these functionals is necessarily unphysical and incorrect, (242) but as mentioned in the beginning of this section, in many applications this may not be a major problem. Unlike many other reparametrized functionals, the newer functionals of Zhao and Truhlar describe the medium-range correlation correctly using the correlation part of the XC functional. (243) In conclusion, the most advanced functionals of Truhlar and co-workers show that, within the overlap distances, the empirically reparametrized functionals can provide surprisingly accurate binding energies even for noncovalent complexes. (185, 241) Although the asymptotic behavior of such reparametrized functionals is necessarily incorrect, they will likely become very useful in a number of applications.
4.5 Double Hybrid Functionals
Double hybrid functionals, like hybrid functionals, combine DFT with a certain portion of exact exchange, but in addition they also add a portion of correlation energy, usually from an MP2-type calculation. This means that the computational demands of double hybrid calculations are similar to those of MP2 calculations, i.e., significantly higher than for DFT itself. In return we can usually obtain somewhat more accurate results. Several double hybrid methods have been developed, using either HartreeFock unoccupied orbitals (244, 245) or DFT orbitals (B2PLYP (151) and mPW2PLYP (246)). A computationally less demanding opposite-spin-only variant of this method was also developed (B2-OS3PLYP). (247) For noncovalent complexes better accuracy can be achieved by adding a portion of the empirical dispersion energy on top of the double hybrid energy. (248)
4.6 Truly Nonlocal Density Functionals for DFT
DFT is an exact theory, and it can describe dispersion interactions correctly, but GGA or meta-GGA functionals are not good approximations to start with. If we want to treat the long-range correlations correctly, we need to choose from a class of truly nonlocal functionals. Several nonlocal forms have been suggested over the years, and recently, their development seems to be reaching the point of practical applicability.
The most common starting points for nonlocal and nonempirical functionals are the adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem (ACFDT) and the random phase approximation (RPA). (249, 250) Depending on the subsequent approximations, which mainly concern the frequency-dependent susceptibility, results of varying quality are obtained.
The first works on this subject were limited to the case of isolated fragments. (251-253) They recovered the desired long-range vdW asymptotics, but the overlap effects were missing, and they diverged at short distances. Sato et al. (254, 255) suggested that when the formula of Andersson, Langreth, and Lundqvist (ALL) (251) is properly (empirically) damped at short distances, the long-range ALL correlation can be combined with a GGA-type functional. Note that it is the grid pointgrid point interaction that is damped here, not the atomatom interaction as in DFT-D. In 2009 Grfenstein and Cremer implemented the damped ALL formula in a quasi-self-consistent way (the density is not consistent with the dispersion interaction), allowing for faster analytical geometry optimizations and frequency calculations. (256) In 2004 Dion et al. published a very promising functional called vdW-DF. (257) The nonlocal correlation is expressed in terms of the densitydensity interaction formula, in which the interaction energy depends on densities at two different locations in space, r and r, and the nonlocality enters through the kernel ϕ: (257) (14) The kernel ϕ is a formula analytically derived for a chosen approximation for a frequency-dependent response function, which depends on the density and density gradient. The entire correlation functional is nonempirical and yields the correct long-range asymptotics. This nonlocal correlation energy is then combined with an LDA correlation functional to get the total correlation, which is usually used in connection with the rev-PBE exchange functional: (258) (15) This scheme has an important advantage of being seamless, which means that the system does not have to be divided into fragments. Also the intramolecular dispersion interaction is accounted for in a natural way. The self-consistent equations and analytical dispersion gradients were derived in 2007. (259) The available tests show that the accuracy of the vdW-DF functional predictions for intermolecular energies depends on the exchange functional with which it is combined. (260, 261) The vdW-DF functional was also implemented self-consistently by Vydrov et al., (261) who studied the effect of the exchange functional used on the performance of the vdW-DF scheme. In the subsequent work Vydrov et al. suggested a very interesting modification of the vdW-DF scheme, which removes the necessity to use the LDA correlation functional. Very importantly, the authors also deal with the question of adjusting the local and nonlocal correlation components (avoiding double counting) through the enhancement factor and an empirical constant. (262) In 2009, the same authors derived a new, simpler form of the nonlocal seamless functional based on the vdW-DF methodology, called VV09, which also performs fairly well for weakly bonded small complexes. (263) A common feature of the vdW-DF-like functionals is that the total (atomic, molecular) correlation energies are worse than those predicted by current GGA functionals, and further work in this direction is necessary. (260, 263) The vdW-DF functional evaluates grid pointgrid point interactions, and therefore, the computational demands depend on the system size as ngrid2. This scaling is of lower order than the scaling of the SCF procedure (N3), but the prefactors are rather large, and the calculations are thus slower than a KS-DFT calculation itself for smaller molecules. Many groups are now working on faster and more efficient implementations of these methods. (260, 264, 265) The nonlocal functionals described above profit from formulas, derived on the basis of simple approximations for the response function, which are easily manageable, but there are also other ways of approaching the correlation energy, starting from the fluctuation dissipation theorem and employing the random phase approximation for the XC kernel. Unfortunately, most of them are not as well tested, and they are often more computationally demanding. To mention at least some, we refer the reader to the works of Lein, Dobson, and Gross, (266) Kohn et al., (267) Fuchs and Gonze, (268) Furche and van Voorhis, (269) Harl and Kresse, (270) and Nguyen and de Gironcoli. (271) One common problem of the accurate nonlocal correlation functionals is the choice of a suitable exchange functional with which to combine it. Even if the correlation functional itself were exact, the intermolecular interaction energies would still be rather inaccurate due to the known exchange functional faults. (260, 261) Many authors argue that exact exchange is necessary for a correct description of intermolecular regions. (272) Range-separated approaches are often suggested as a solution. (272-274) Nevertheless, the question of a sufficiently accurate exchange functional to be combined with the nonlocal correlation functionals still remains open.
4.7 Other Approaches
An interesting way to calculate the dispersion energy was suggested by Silvestrelli. (275) In this method, the C6 dispersion is calculated from the ALL formula, (251) but the electron density entering this formula is taken from the maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs). This allows one to perform analytic integration and to avoid the computationally intense numerical double integration over grid points, which slows most other ALL implementations. Importantly, the damping function is made dependent on the actual electronic density here, through the spread of the Wannier functions. The method is perturbative; the electron density is not consistent with the dispersion interactions. Maerzke et al., based on work by Chang et al., (276) suggested a method called self-consistent polarization density functional theory, SCP-DFT, in which dispersion is added using an expression consistent with second-order perturbation theory. (277) Another simple approach by Mackie and DiLabio uses reparametrized local pseudopotentials to provide some additional attraction at vdW distances. This is not physically correct but reduces errors at short distances significantly. (278) Wesolowski and Tran applied a bifunctional originally developed for other purposes to the weakly bonded complexes. (279) Although his results are generally superior to those of LDA or GGA calculations, the approach is limited to the electron overlap regime (not providing the correct 1/r6 monomer asymptotics) and requires partitioning of the system into subsystems. Another scheme by Hesselmann calculates interaction energies only for the case of separated monomers. (98) Here, the total interaction energy is based on the supermolecular MP2 interation energy corrected for the difference between the uncoupled and coupled second-order dispersion energy. In this case the interaction energies seem to be surprisingly accurate. 5 Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) (280) provides a deeper understanding of intermolecular interactions through the decomposition of the total interaction energy into physically meaningful components. The original version of SAPT was formulated as a double-perturbation series, in which the intramolecular and intermolecular perturbations were treated separately. An important advantage of the double-perturbative scheme is that it is exact, and inclusion of higher orders should bring one closer to the accurate energy components. One of the disadvantages is its rather large computational demand.
In 2001 Williams and Chabalowski (281) proposed a new scheme in which the monomers in the SAPT calculations are represented by KohnSham DFT and only the intermolecular interaction is treated perturbatively. This approach is much faster than the original SAPT, but the initial results were rather discouraging. Two groups independently followed the idea, and over the following two years developed two very similar approaches with very good results. Misquitta, Szalewicz, and Jeziorski named their method SAPT(DFT), (282-285) and Hesselmann and Jansen named it DFT-SAPT. (129, 286-288) The key components in both approaches are the use of the asymptotically corrected DFT functionals (e.g., PBE0AC (129)) and calculation of the dispersion energy from time-dependent density functional theory. The interaction energy is calculated (to the second order) as a sum of the electrostatic, E(1)elst, exchange-repulsion, E(1)exch-rep, induction, E(2)ind, exchange-induction, E(2)exch-ind, dispersion, E(2)disp, and exchange-dispersion, E(2)exch-disp, terms, and a correction for some of the higher order contributions, δ(HF) (for more details see, e.g., refs 129 and 284):(16) In terms of accuracy, the original pure wave-function-based SAPT is claimed to be a reference quality method with results that are comparable to those of high-level wave-function-based calculations, such as CCSD(T). The DFT-based SAPT is naturally less reliable, partly because it depends on the quality of the density functional used. The electrostatic term and the second-order induction and dispersion terms are potentially exact, (289) which means that they could be calculated exactly provided that the exact density XC functional and frequency-dependent XC kernel are known. The exchange energy is, unfortunately, not even potentially exact. Nevertheless, available numerical experience shows that DFT-based SAPT provides fairly accurate total interaction energies usually comparable with the pure SAPT results. (129, 284) DFT-based SAPT is computationally much faster than high-level wave-function-based methods, and using currently available implementations (Molpro 2006 (also 2008 and 2009) (290) and SAPT2008 (291)), complexes containing around 50 atoms can be treated using large basis sets, such as aug-cc-pVTZ, in tens of hours of CPU time. 6 Semiempirical Quantum Chemical Theories Semiempirical QM methods can properly and fully describe all quantum effects. Because they are parametrized for covalent bonding, however, their use for noncovalent complexes is not straightforward. Let us add that, unlike the nonempirical HartreeFock method, which does not recover the correlation energy (and, consequently, also does not describe the London dispersion energy, which forms the dominant part of the intersystem correlation energy), all QM semiempirical methods can, in principle, recover the correlation energy.
Semiempirical methods were originally developed for theoretical studies on extended systems, for which the computational cost of nonemepirical ab initio methods was prohibitively high. (292) The second-generation methods such as MNDO, (293, 294) AM1, (295) and PM3 (296, 297) provided relatively reliable results for systems containing the main-group elements in their ground electronic states, which can be described by s and p atomic orbitals. The use of these methods for noncovalent complexes (H-bonded and dispersion-bound) was, as mentioned above, limited. The original MNDO method was not able to describe either of these interaction types. Since it was believed that H-bonding is more important than dispersion, the problem was addressed in subsequent methods (AM1, PM3, and others) by the introduction of an additional corecore term as well as by parametrization of the method toward hydrogen bonding. Another step forward was introduced in the parametrization of the PM3 method, in which not only the energies but also the geometries of H-bonded complexes were emphasized. Recently, a special parametrization of the PM3 method, PM3(BP), was introduced for applications related to nucleic acid base pairs. (298) The first attempt to include the dispersion energy in semiempirical QM methods was made by Martin and Clark (299) though the addition of R6, R8, and R10 dispersion terms to existing semiempirical corecore repulsion appeared much earlier. (300) The dispersion energy in ref 299 was calculated using the additive atomic orbital polarizability tensors, and the best values were obtained by using the SlaterKirkwood modification of the London formula. A similar approach was used later for modification of the AM1 and PM3 methods. (301) After reparametrization of both the semiempirical method and the damping function, considerably improved characteristics of noncovalent complexes resulted. The semiempirical methods of the OMx (x = 1, 2, and 3) family are known to describe noncovalent complexes better than AM1 and PM3, which is mainly due to the use of orthogonalization corrections. (302-304) These corrections improve the description of the Pauli repulsion. Tuttle and Thiel augmented the OM2 and OM3 methods with empirical dispersion terms, but in contrast to the previous case, they used the original parametrizations (for the parent semiemirical methods). (305) Similarly, as in the cases of AM1 and PM3, significant improvement of the original methods for noncovalent interactions was achieved. Jorgensen et al. developed the bond and group equivalents scheme, which considerably improved not only the heats of formation but also the H-bonding energies. (306) The suggested modification of the PM3 method, called the pairwise distance-directed Gaussian (PDDG) method, provides an improvement over PM3 in the description of intermolecular interactions. Application of the method is limited to compounds containing C, H, N, and O atoms (as it is for many semiempirical QM methods). Possible future developments toward improving H-bonds within the MNDO framework are outlined in ref 307, but no further progress has been reported up to now. To summarize, we can state that all currently used semiempirical QM methods systematically underestimate the strength of H-bonds by approximately 2030% and if the dispersion energy term is not added they fail completely for dispersion-bound complexes. However, even if the dispersion energy is added, the respective methods are still not accurate enough for most applications in noncovalent complexes. There are many reasons for this shortcoming, such as parametrization for only a limited number of atoms, strongly overestimated stabilization energies for optimized geometries of H-bonded complexes, etc.
An interesting attempt to combine the semiempirical QM and MM was made recently. (308) The authors used the PM3 Hamiltonian in combination with the AMBER force field. Contrary to standardly used QM/MM approaches, where the reaction center is described by QM and the environment by MM, here one subsystem is described by QM and the other one by MM. The authors modified the commonly used corecore approach by Field et al. (309) and replaced it by a new one that provides stronger H-bonding (in comparison with other QM/MM semiempirical approaches). The suggested procedure provides very promising stabilization energies for model complexes.
Recently, the new semiempirical method PM6 (parametrized model 6) was introduced and was shown to be superior to other semiempirical QM methods in various aspects. (310) It is an NDDO-based method improved by the adoption of Viotyuks corecore diatomic interaction term and Thiels d orbital approximation. (302-304) These modifications allowed parametrization for 80 elements and also reduced the error for main-group elements. (310, 311) PM6 is available in the MOPAC code (versions 2007 and higher). (312) The latest version, MOPAC 2009, introduces another interesting feature that makes the PM6 method usable for very large systemsa linear scaling variant of the SCF procedure using localized orbitals, named MOZYME. (312) Because of favorable scaling, the code can even be used in MD simulations.
Despite all these advantages, the PM6 method (like other semiempirical QM methods) still lacks the ability to accurately describe noncovalent interactions, specifically the dispersion energy and hydrogen bonding. Even though the method yields surprisingly good geometries for all types of complexes, the interaction energies for dispersion-bound and H-bonded complexes are substantially underestimated. As mentioned above, this feature is characteristic for all semiempirical methods (see also ref 313). The approximations used simply do not allow one to simultaneously obtain good descriptions of various noncovalent interactions and covalent interactions, whose description is entirely different. Let us recall once again that this is a very demanding task, and among all widely used ab initio QM procedures (i.e., methods that do not use any empirical or experimental parameters), only the CCSD(T)/CBS technique satisfactorily describes all these interactions.
To improve the performance of the PM6 method, two modifications were recently introduced: (i) an empirical dispersion energy term, which improves the description of complexes controlled by the dispersion energy, and (ii) an additional electrostatic term, which improves the description of hydrogen-bonded complexes. This correction is directional and should thus provide a better description of H-bonds, including directional characteristics, than the standard semiempirical QM methods. The resulting method, PM6 with corrections for dispersion and hydrogen bonding, is named PM6-DH. (314) The aim of these modifications was ambitiousto achieve the standard ab initio chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) for extended noncovalent complexes.
The first PM6-DH method provides very good estimates of interaction energies for dispersion-bound complexes, but the description of H-bonded complexes was still not completely satisfactory. A further improvement (the so-called second-generation correction) of the H-bonding corrections was suggested recently. (315) The main difference with respect to the first-generation correction (314) concerns the description of XH···YZ H-bonding, where six internal coordinates were considered: the H···Y bond length, the two bond angles XH···Y and ZY···H, and the corresponding three torsion angles. As a result, the new version of the H-bonding correction includes three global and five method-dependent parameters describing H-bonds involving N and O acceptor and donor atoms. These parameters were adjusted on the basis of high-level QM calculations. The improved correction was evaluated for the PM6, AM1, OM3, and SCC-DF-TB-D methods and provides a significant improvement over the original versions of the methods mentioned above. 7 JSCH-2005 and S22 Databases There are several reasons for performing highly accurate QM calculations for model complexes; probably the most important among them is the necessity to have a suitable test set for validating lower level computational methods. We have shown that, among all computational procedures considered, only the CCSD(T)/CBS procedure represents the genuine ab initio technique capable of producing accurate results for medium-sized complexes. In this technique, all quantities are directly calculated and no empirical parameters are adopted. The theory behind the procedure allows for the description of all different types of noncovalent interactions occurring in molecular clusters and complex molecular systems. The computational cost of the CCSD(T)/CBS procedure for medium and extended systems is, however, very high, and despite enormous progress in computational hardware and software, use of this technique for systems with more than about 50 atoms is (and will be in the near future) still impractical. The same is true for dynamical calculations of smaller systems. Evidently, much faster computational procedures should be introduced, allowing one to perform accurate calculations for these systems.
As was shown in the previous parts of the review, the standard lower level computational procedures (both WFT and DFT) fail to describe various types of molecular complexes with quantitative accuracy, with the most frequent problem being connected with the description of the dispersion energy. The only chance for the treatment of larger systems is thus to parametrize the energy term in these (and other) methods against highly accurate computational methods. The benchmark database set should cover all important bonding motifs and should be easily extended in the future for new structural motifs. MP2/CBS and CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies and geometries for more than 100 DNA base pairs, amino acid pairs, and other model complexes were presented in the JSCH-2005 benchmark set. (131) Extrapolation to the CBS limit was done with the two-point extrapolation method using several basis set extrapolation schemes (aug-cc-pVDZ  aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ  aug-cc-pVQZ, cc-pVTZ  cc-pVQZ). CCSD(T) correction terms, determined as a differences between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies, were evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G**(0.25,0.15) and cc-pVDZ). We have seen that this procedure yields reasonable stabilization energies that are comparable to the most accurate ones obtained by direct extrapolation of the CCSD(T) energies. Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized and experimental ones.
Apart from the large JSCH-2005 set, a smaller S22 set was also introduced. (131) For the latter set, larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and optimized geometries generated using the CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 methods were sometimes adopted. The S22 set can be recommended for parametrization or for a first screening of a method, while the larger JSCH-2005 set is more appropriate for verification of a computational procedure. Table 1 contains interaction energies for the S22 set (the structures of all 22 complexes are visualized in Figure 1), which contains 7 H-bonded complexes, 8 complexes with predominant dispersion contributions, and 7 mixed complexes (containing a mixture of electrostatic and dispersion interactions). It is important that the set span a wide range of interaction strengths to represent the diversity of interactions in biomacromolecules. In each of the above-mentioned subgroups the stabilities of the complexes range between 3 and 20, 0.5 and 15, and 1.2 and 8 kcal/mol, respectively. In this set the dispersion-bound complexes are as numerous as H-bonded ones, but they contribute to the sum of the stabilization energies by less than 40%, which is in line with our previous calculations on DNA nucleic acid bases. The energies presented in Table 1 represent a very valuable set that can be used for testing different lower level methods. A strong point here is the fact that different types of noncovalent complexes covering the most important biomolecular motifs are presented. It should be mentioned that the originally published S22 set contained some errors; the present version is upgraded, and all these errors and uncertainties have been removed.

The basis set abbreviations TZ, aTZ, QZ, aQZ, and 5Z (in parentheses) stand for cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, aug-cc-pVQZ, and cc-pV5Z, respectively. In the modified cc-pVTZ set (tz-fd), one set of f functions and one set of d functions were removed (only the more diffuse d function was kept) and the hydrogen basis set was modified analogically. Geometries were determined with full (counterpoise-corrected) optimizations with analytical (MP2) or numerical (CCSD(T)) gradients.
How accurate are the S22 benchmark data? The S22 set was published in 2006, and since then, higher level calculations have been performed either for selected complexes (48, 52) or for the entire set. (127, 316) On the basis of these studies, it is possible to conclude that the stabilization energies of H-bonded complexes are slightly underestimated while those of dispersion-bound complexes are slightly overestimated when compared to the most accurate CCSD(T)/CBS values. The errors are, however, in the tens of kilocalories per mole, and the largest error of about 0.5 kcal/mol was found for the stacked benzene···indole, adenine···thymine, and methyladenine···methythymine complexes. As expected, the source of these errors is the determination of the CCSD(T) correction term with small basis sets. Evidently, in this step, a basis set of at least aug-cc-pVDZ quality should be used. 8 Results and Discussion
8.1 Energy Characteristics
To establish a consistent metric for the evaluation of the performances of various theoretical techniques for the calculation of binding energies in noncovalent complexes, we have decided to use one consistent data set of benchmark interaction energies. This data set should comprise various motifs of noncovalent complexes, with energy characteristics that are consistently evaluated at a very high theoretical level. We use our S22 data set and, to a lesser extent, the JSCH-2005 data set. The reason is evident; these benchmark sets have frequently been used in the literature in recent years and represent, without doubt, the most frequently used data set for noncovalent interactions. Table 2 comprises statistical data on the performance of various WFT, DFT, and semiempirical QM methods, (74, 120, 122, 133, 136, 139, 206, 210, 243, 255, 260, 315, 317, 318, 319, 320) while the preceding table gives information on the performance of various methods toward some subsets of the other data sets mentioned above.

When comparing the performances of different methods for the S22 set, we will look not only at the total rmsds, but also at the MSEs and rmsd errors of different types of complexes separately. This gives us additional information regarding the strengths and weaknesses of each method. For instance, the average error (MSE) of the B3LYP-D/TZVP method is 0.09 kcal/mol for the entire S22 set, which is an excellent result; however, the MSEs for the hydrogen-bonded and the dispersion-bonded complexes are 0.83 and 0.69 kcal/mol, respectively. The average difference between hydrogen-bonded and stacked complexes, ΔΔDH, is thus 0.83 + 0.69 = 1.52 kcal/mol. This is a very large systematic error, which may be detrimental in a case where we want to compare, for instance, the relative stability of small peptide conformers containing both hydrogen bonds and dispersion contacts, because the typical energy difference between such conformers is rather small (usually less than 1 kcal/mol). (212-214) Note, however, that the corresponding error in pure B3LYP is over 5 kcal/mol, which makes pure B3LYP completely useless for such applications. This example shows that more detailed analysis of the S22 errors brings valuable additional insight. Discussions will be presented separately for WFT, DFT, and semiempirical QM methods.
8.1.1 WFT Methods
8.1.1.1 MP2- and SCS-MP2-Based Methods
Comparison of MP2 results with the estimated CCSD(T)/CBS benchmark values confirms the typical error pattern discussed in section 3. MP2/CBS values (obtained by Helgaker extrapolation from aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets) for H-bonded complexes are underestimated on average by 0.2 kcal/mol, while being strongly overestimated for the dispersion-dominated (primarily the ππ stacked) complexes on average by as much as 1.5 kcal/mol. This unbalanced performace leads to a ΔΔDH value of almost 1.3 kcal/mol, thus making the MP2/CBS method unsuitable for simultaneous calculation or comparison of the stabilities of complexes and conformers with different interaction characters. The accuracy for complexes with mixed character is also quite unsatisfactory, with average errors being almost 0.6 kcal/mol. Comparing the basis set unsaturated CP-corrected MP2/cc-pVTZ with MP2/CBS, the same trends can be observed. The quality of the description for H-bonded complexes increases with the quality of the basis set, while the overestimation of the ππ stacking interaction is enhanced. Neglecting the CP correction in MP2 calculations is disadvantageous for both H-bonded and ππ stacked complexes for reasons similar to those mentioned above.
The scaling of opposite- and/or same spin-components in SCS-MP2/CBS leads to appreciable improvements compared to the MP2/CBS on average; however, for the H-bonded complexes the average error increases by almost 1 kcal/mol. The use of scaling parameters optimized against molecular interactions in SCS(MI)-MP2 clearly improves the balance of the method, leading to a decrease in the SCS-MP2 ΔΔDH from 0.68 to almost 0 kcal/mol for SCS(MI)-MP2. Still, the deviation of the SCS(MI)-MP2 results from the CCSD(T) reference is about 0.3 kcal/mol, comparable to the accuracy of MP2/CBS for all but the dispersion-dominated complexes. Neglect of the same-spin component in SOS(MI)-MP2 leads to a less balanced treatment than that given by MP2 or SCS-MP2 with an average error comparable with that of MP2, but for a calculation speedup of about an order of magnitude.
Substitution of the UCHF dispersion energy contained in the supermolecular MP2 interaction energy by the more accurate one from TDDFT leads to major improvement in the accuracy; i.e., see the results for the MP2C method. (133) The rmsd of about 0.2 kcal/mol for the whole S22 is comparable with that of the SCS(MI)-MP2 method fitted for the S22 set, or that of the SCS(MI)-CCSD method, which is, however, more than an order of magnitude more expensive. The ΔΔDH value of 0.05 kcal/mol is one of the lowest from all the methods presented in Table 2 (except for M06-2X/DIDZ, which is fortuitously 0.01 kcal/mol, or the already mentioned SCS(MI)-MP2 method fitted for this test set, which is 0 kcal/mol), making the hybrid WFT/DFT MP2C method one of the most balanced option for accurate calculation of different types of interactions.
Comparison of MP2 and LMP2 calculated in the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set indicates a certain error compensation between the overestimation of the stabilities of ππ stacked complexes and the intrinsic error of the local treatment. The overall accuracy of LMP2 seems to be slightly better than that of MP2, but the balance of LMP2 is slightly worse due to larger errors in the description of H-bonded complexes.
8.1.1.2 Third-Order WFT Methods: MP2.5, MP3, CCSD, SCS-CCSD, and SCS(MI)-CCSD
Results for all methods in this paragraph were obtained analogously to the estimated CCSD(T)/CBS values used as benchmarks; i.e., higher order correlation contributions were calculated with rather small- to medium-sized basis sets in the calculation of ΔCCSD(T) (see Table 2). Let us first analyze the performance of the MP3 method. The overall accuracy and balance of MP3/CBS is better than that of MP2/CBS, comparable perhaps with that of SCS-MP2/CBS. A characteristic pattern opposing the one observed for MP2 can be recognized in the MP3 results for the dispersion-dominated complexes (again, these are mostly governed by strong, ππ stacked complexes), which is a strong underestimation of binding energies by an average of about 1 kcal/mol. This is contrary to the overestimation of binding energies, by an average of about 1.5 kcal/mol, seen for MP2. The quality of the results for the H-bonded complexes is slightly improved over those of MP2, leading to an average error of about zero, probably attributable to error compensation caused by the presence of H-bonded complexes with significant dispersion contributions (such as the 2-pyridoxine···2-aminopyridine complex, for instance). The error statistics for the more sophisticated CCSD method show that inclusion of correlation effects beyond the MP3 method strongly disrupts the error cancellation for the group of H-bonded complexes, leading to systematic underestimation by an average of about 0.6 kcal/mol. The overestimation of interactions for complexes in the dispersion-dominated group is also reduced, thus improving the balance of CCSD over MP3 by 0.7 kcal/mol, but decreasing the accuracy, as measured by the average error, by almost 0.2 kcal/mol.
The accuracy of both MP3 and CCSD is significantly increased after introduction of empirical approximations either via scaling of the third-order correlation contribution, i.e., MP2.5, or by scaling of the same- and opposite-spin components of the CCSD correlation energy, i.e., SCS-CCSD and SCS(MI)-CCSD. Scaling of the third-order correlation energy in MP2.5 to the average systematic errors of MP2 and MP3 leads to a more balanced treatment, with DDΗ being about 0.2 kcal/mol, and increases the accuracy to an average error of 0.16 kcal/mol. The performance of this method for the H-bonded complexes is excellent, but an average overestimation of binding energies by about 0.3 kcal/mol, attributable to the ππ stacked complexes, is still not eliminated due to the inexactness of the scaling factor. The most accurate and sufficiently balanced results are obtained by the SCS(MI)-CCSD method. The overall average error is about 0.2 kcal/mol (below 0.3 kcal/mol for each group of complexes individually), and the ΔΔDH value is essentially zero. This indicates that the SCS(MI)-CCSD method is capable of delivering the most accurate and balanced description from all the tested methods.
8.1.2 DFT Methods
8.1.2.1 Pure DFT Functionals
Table 2 compares the performance of various DFT plus dispersion methods, and in several cases, results for the corresponding pure functional (i.e., without the dispersion correction) are shown. Without the dispersion correction, the pure DFT functionals exhibit very similar deficiencies when used along with large basis sets; these inaccuracies are well-known and have been characterized for many complexes. The interaction energies of the dispersion-bonded complexes are strongly underestimated, and the hydrogen-bonded and mixed complexes are also, on average, underestimated by the GGA, meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals. The only exception is LDA, which is well-known to overbind noncovalent complexes. The hydrogen-bonded complexes are, however, described rather well by most GGA-based functionals if a small (double-ζ quality) basis set with counterpoise corrections, or a triple-ζ basis set without counterpoise correction, is used. This fortunate error cancellation has likely contributed to DFTs popularity for intermolecular applications on systems with a prevailing polar character. It is worth noting that the differences between individual functionals are rather large. For instance, the PBE functional underestimates binding energies for the dispersion-bonded complexes by about 4.6 kcal/mol (on average), but the BLYP functional underestimates them by more than 7 kcal/mol (both with a large saturated basis). This shows that some kind of functional-dependent scaling for the dispersion correction energy is inevitable. ΔΔDH is usually around 4 kcal/mol, meaning that the dispersion-bonded complexes are underbound on average by about 4 kcal/mol compared to the hydrogen-bonded complexes. The hybrid functionals seem to be, in most cases, an improvement over their respective nonhybrid version. These large differences between functionals were also found in ref 322, which discusses the performance of a larger number of functionals, along with nine basis sets, for the description of hydrogen bonds.
8.1.2.2 DFT-D Methods
When an empirical dispersion correction is added to a DFT functional, the overall performance improves in all cases. (323) Both MSE and rmsd errors tend to be smaller not only for the dispersion-dominated complexes, where they drop severalfold, but also for the hydrogen-bonded and mixed complexes. As we will see below, all types of dispersion corrections, being empirical or nonempirical, in general significantly improve the accuracy of DFT for larger molecules. In many cases, like for TPSS-D/LP, B97-D, (151) and ωB97X-D, (206) the overall accuracy of the DFT-D method is better than the accuracy of the, much more computationally intense, MP2/cc-pVTZ/CP and MP2/CBS methods. This is in part because the MP2 method overestimates dispersion contribution in larger bases sets, while DFT-D does not. Even the less accurate DFT-D combinations show results that are comparable to those of MP2/cc-pVTZ/CP. It is, however, necessary to use at least triple-ζ quality basis sets, because the BSSE is very large in double-ζ bases and results deteriorate progressively. Note that most DFT-D schemes are parametrized without employing the counterpoise correction and should be used this way. Although combinations of the standard DFT functionals with empirical dispersion terms represent remarkable improvements in general, these techniques exhibit systematic overbinding of the hydrogen-bonded complexes and, consequently, an imbalanced description of the relative energies of complexes of different physical natures; this imbalance is measured by ΔΔDH (136) (the last column in Table 2). In terms of ΔΔDH, the best combination with a standard DFT functional is TPSS-D/LP, with a value of about 0.3 kcal/mol; all other functionals give much worse results. This rather serious problem can be mitigated by reparametrizing the DFT functional itself in the presence of the empirical dispersion correction, as was done by Grimme (B97-D) (151) and Chai and Head-Gordon (ωB97X-D). (206) These functionals are currently probably the most recommendable DFT-based methods for noncovalent complexes.
8.1.2.3 Effects of the Basis Set Superposition Error
The basis set superposition error is generally much smaller in DFT than in the WFT calculations. Still, it is rather large and significantly affects the quality of results for noncovalent complexes. In the double-ζ quality bases, the BSSE amounts to about 20% of the total interaction energy. (136) When the counterpoise correction is applied, results improve, but errors remain rather large. However, using counterpoise corrections for optimizations is complicated (counterpoise-corrected gradient optimization requires considerably more CPU time), and it cannot be applied in the case of intramolecular BSSE. Therefore, most current DFT-D parametrizations are designed without counterpoise corrections and should be used this way. When the use of a double-ζ basis cannot be avoided, different parameters with down-scaled dispersion should be used. (136) With double-ζ basis sets, DFT-D accuracy is generally rather poor. This poor description of noncovalent interactions can have large consequences; for example, results for relative conformer energies in small peptides are probably useless due to small energy differences and imbalanced descriptions of different types of interactions. (78, 215) It is recommended to use at least a triple-ζ quality basis. Although BSSE is still non-negligible in triple-ζ bases, it is partially compensated by adding somewhat less dispersion (stronger damping). When almost saturated basis sets are used (of quadruple-ζ quality or plane waves in CPMD), results are usually somewhat worse than for the triple-ζ basis. This can probably be explained by the improper behavior of current XC functionals and less efficient error cancellation.
8.1.2.4 Reparametrization of Current DFT Functionals
Table 2 also shows results for one of the most popular reparametrizations of a DFT functional from the M06 suite, M06-2X. (185) We will compare these results to those obtained using a very accurate DFT-D method, TPSS-D/LP, (136) both counterpoise-uncorrected in similar triple-ζ quality basis sets, MG3S and 6-311++G(3df,3pd). We have to keep in mind that the TSPP-D/LP method was parametrized using the S22 set while M06-2X was not. The overall accuracy of both methods seems to be comparable, but there are differences. While the TPSS-D method performs better overall for the dispersion-bonded complexes, M06-2X is better for the hydrogen-bonded complexes, which is also true after optimization of the geometries with the respective methods. Interestingly, while DFT-D tends to overestimate the hydrogen-bonded complexes (ΔΔDH = 0.30 kcal/mol), M06-2X, on the contrary, underestimates hydrogen-bonded complexes with respect to the dispersion-bound ones (ΔΔDH = 0.64 kcal/mol), as do other pure DFT functionals. It appears that M06-2X, as a pure DFT functional, retains a tendency to better deal with the hydrogen-bonded complexes than with the dispersion-bonded ones. This is probably unavoidable, because the long-range behavior of M06-2X is incorrect. (242) Nevertheless, M06-2X still provides a relatively accurate description of the weakly bonded complexes, and it is probably the best choice among the pure DFT functionals to date.
8.1.2.5 Double Hybrid Functionals
Table 2 shows results for two double hybrid functionals, mPW2PLYP and B2PLYP. (246) Both functionals markedly underestimate the long-range interactions, and in terms of accuracy, they cannot compete with the DFT-D method. Note that these methods were not originally developed for the description of the intermolecular interactions. When a certain portion of the empirical dispersion is added to these double hybrids, like in mPW2PLYP-D and B2PLYP-D, (248) the results for intermolecular interactions are much improved (B2PLYP performs significantly better for the complexes with larger dispersion contributions) and comparable to the best DFT-D results.
8.1.2.6 Truly Nonlocal Density Functionals
Truly nonlocal density functionals can recover the correct physical description of the dispersion energy. Table 2 shows results for two such functionals, vdW-DF and LC-BOP+ALL. vdW-DF was derived by Dion et al., (257) and it combines a standard GGA exchange energy (here revPBE (258) and PBE (324)) with the LDA correlation energy and with the nonlocal correlation energy (NL). It is not necessary to use any damping function here, because damping occurs naturally. Gulans et al. (260) implemented vdW-DF in the SIESTA (325) code with self-consistent dispersion density and tested it on the S22 set. The accuracy is comparable to that of the DFT-D scheme, but without the empirical input. Apparently the vdW-DF method overestimates the stabilities of the dispersion-bound complexes relative to the hydrogen-bonded ones, ΔΔDH = 2.12 for revPBE and 1.37 for PBE, in contrast to the opposite trend in DFT-D. It is likely that a large part of the errors originate in the nonoptimal exchange functional and much better results might be achieved if the exchange part was reparameterized using the scheme of Grimme. (151) Unfortunately, vdW-DF is bound to use an LDA correlation functional by design, which also somewhat limits its potential accuracy in many applications. The second example is LC-BOP+ALL, (254, 255) which is based on the ALL nonlocal functional suggested by Andersson, Langreth, and Lundqvist. (251) Because ALL is divergent at short distances (unlike vdW-DF, it is not seamless), it needs some damping, which is empirical here and quite similar to the interatomic damping in DFT-D. The presence of the adjustable empirical parameters seems to improve the accuracy, as LC-BOP+ALL results are somewhat better than the results of vdW-ALL (see Table 2). Interestingly, the damped ALL term exhibits a systematic flaw similar to that of the DFT-D method; i.e., the hydrogen-bonded complexes are overestimated relative to the dispersion-bound ones (ΔΔDH = +1.09). This is interesting when compared with the vdW-DF functional, which exhibits the opposite trend. The main difference between those two methods is that the ALL nonlocal correlation is always negative while the vdW-DF nonlocal correlation can also be positive (repulsive) in the shorter ranges. The repulsive contribution of vdW-DF probably represents just that part of repulsion that otherwise could only be added by reparametrization of the GGA functional. (151, 206) Overall, the nonlocal DFT functionals seem to perform relatively well with errors comparable to those of the empirical dispersion methods, but at the expense of non-negligible additional time requirements. Because of their firm physical groundings, the nonlocal functionals are likely to be significantly improved and may become very important in the near future.
In conclusion, currently there are several DFT-based models able to provide fairly accurate descriptions of the noncovalent complexes (statistically speaking). However, could one of them become a method of choice for benchmarking in the future? As of now, the most accurate methods, such as DFT-D, contain empirical parameters. Although they may be extremely useful in molecular modeling, they are not good candidates for benchmark calculations because of their empirical nature. On the other hand, the nonempirical methods such as vdW-DF do not seem to be accurate enough for benchmarking purposes yet. Here, inaccuracies arise mainly in the overlap region and stem from the double counting of correlation effects and from the nonoptimal adjustment of the long-range correlation part to the short-range correlation and/or exchange. We believe that if this issue can be solved with minimal empiricism and good accuracy, the DFT-based methods can achieve the accuracy and robustness necessary for benchmarking in the near future.
8.1.3 Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory
Table 2 shows DFT-SAPT interaction energies calculated using the aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets and results extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The density functional used (PBE0AC) and other details are as in ref 129, and we used the Molpro 2006 ab initio package. (290) The overall performance of the DFT-SAPT method with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis is relatively good, and the overall error is similar to that of the MP2/cc-pVTZ/CP calculation. In the aug-cc-pVTZ basis the errors are only slightly worse than the errors of the CCSD method in a large basis set (see seven rows above in the same table). Now we can extrapolate the dispersion component to the complete basis set limit and add it to the sum of the nondispersion components calculated in the aug-cc-pVTZ basis, similarly to that in ref 129. The results obtained in this way (the third DFT-SAPT row) are only slightly better than those in the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, and the interaction energies remain on average underestimated. This indicates that a yet larger basis set is needed for DFT-SAPT calculations. If we extrapolate also the nondispersion components and apply a somewhat more progressive extrapolation to the dispersion component (results not shown), almost all errors drop below 0.3 kcal/mol. Therefore, we believe that if a larger basis set was used, the quality of the DFT-SAPT results might be comparable to that of the CCSD(T)/CBS reference. We can conclude that the DFT-SAPT method in the aug-cc-pVTZ basis provides relatively reliable and accurate intermolecular interaction energies and it is very likely that if a better basis set was used, DFT-SAPT might compete with the quality of the wave-function-based reference for molecules within the S22 set.
8.1.4 Semiempirical QM Methods
Table 2 shows that all semimepirical methods of the standard form provide poor results for noncovalent complexes. The AM1 method gives the largest average error for the entire set, while the more advanced methods give errors that are around half those of AM1. Investigating the performance of all methods for subclasses of the S22 set, we find the largest errors occur for the dispersion-bound complexes. AM1 also gives the largest average error (11 kcal/mol) for these complexes, with other semiempirical methods yielding errors for this interaction type that are also very (unacceptably) large. Reviewing the performances of semiempirical methods for H-bonded complexes, we find, surprisingly, that here also these methods fail and provide very large errors.
Dramatic improvements in overall performance result when dispersion corrections are included, with the best results (by far) being obtained with the OM2-D technique, which produces an MSE that is close to zero. Performing deeper analyses, we realize, however, that the method has rather large positive errors for H-bonded complexes and rather large, but negative, errors for dispersion-bound complexes, a trend that is reflected in the large ΔΔDH error (2.3 kcal/mol). Let us note here that this error is substantially smaller for the parent OM2 method. The smallest rmsd error among all dispersion-augmented methods is again for OM2-D, but for the reason discussed above the method cannot be recommended for general use. Investigating the performance of these dispersion-corrected methods for individual subclasses, we find significant improvements over the pure semiempirical methods for dispersion-bound complexes while improvement for H-bonded systems is only slight. This is the main point that led us to introduce a second correction that treats H-bonding. The joint dispersion + H-bonding correction (designated by a -DH2 extension) improved the performance of each of the parent semiempirical methods substantially. The average error for the entire S22 set was reduced from 3.4 to 0.1 for PM6, from 3.6 to 0.1 for OM3, from 6.8 to 0.2 for AM1, and from 3.6 to 0.4 for SCC-DFT-B (all values are in kilocalories per mole). Even more important is the fact that the average errors are now small for each of the subclasses. The lowest error values were observed for PM6-DH2, whose well-balanced treatment of interaction types is reflected by the methods very small ΔΔDH value, which is close to zero. Evidently the proposed scheme outperforms all other existing H-bonding- and dispersion-energy-corrected semiempirical methods by a significant margin and yields results comparable to those of the current WFT and DFT techniques for a large number of investigated cases. This finding can be demonstrated by the values of the mean unsigned error (with respect to the benchmark CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energy, all values in kilocalories per mole) for various WFT, DFT, and semiempirical methods: MP2/CBS, 0.8; DFT-D/TPSS/TZVP, 0.6; DFT-D/TPSS/6-311+G(3df,2pd), 0.3; M06-2X/6-311+G(3df,2p), 0.4; SCC-DF-TB-DH2, 1.2; AM1-DH2, 0.7; OM3-DH2, 0.6; PM6-DH2, 0.4.
The dispersion corrections to the AM1, OMX, and PM6 methods were parametrized against the S22 set or its subsets. It is thus important to test the performance of these methods against binding energies of other noncovalent complexes not included in the parametrization set. The MSE error (kcal/mol) for the noncharged H-bonded complexes in the JSCH2005 set (37 entries) and H-bonded peptides (13 entries) from the same data set are as follows (for various methods): DFT-D/TPSS/TZVP, 0.4, 0.4; OM3-DH2, 0.8, 0.4; AM1-DH2, 0.1, 1.5; SCC-DF-TB-DH2, 2.3, 0.7; PM6-DH2, 0.7, 0.1. Evidently, all of the semiempirical methods perform well, and their performance is comparable to those of considerably more expensive DFT methods. Among all the semiempirical methods tested, the best results were obtained with PM6-DH2. When the geometries of the investigated complexes are optimized, PM6-DH2 provides comparable or even better results. This point is very important since it indicates that the method can be used in both geometry optimization and molecular dynamic simulations. Let us add that this point is also critical with other semiempirical QM methods. Geometry optimizations frequently lead to very distinct structures, considerably different from the starting ones; binding energies for these optimized structures are often unrealistically large.
8.2 Geometry Characteristics
The stabilities of most noncovalent interactions depend heavily on geometric parameters, a property that is necessary for the fine-tuning and diversity of biochemical processes. Most investigations concerned with the accurate characterization of noncovalent interactions in biomacromolecules have focused on obtaining accurate binding energies either at the potential energy minimum (as determined at some lower level of theory) or using experimentally derived complex structures (such as those obtained from X-ray crystal structures). It has long been believed that energies are more sensitive to the theoretical level used than geometries and, consequently, that lower level theoretical approaches can be applied to obtain accurate minimum energy geometric structures. Here we concentrate on studies characterizing the dependence of noncovalent interactions on geometrical parameters, and it will be shown that it is necessary to apply high-level theoretical methods to obtain accurate geometries. Continuing with one of the major themes of this review, we will largely focus on the performance of various methods compared with high-level reference data, such as those obtained using the CCSD(T)/CBS method. There are several types of studies that should be considered here: (a) studies involving potential energy curves for molecular complexes, (b) studies involving gradient optimization of molecular complexes, and (c) studies involving conformational analyses on systems whose structure is largely governed by noncovalent interactions.
There are many reasons that it is important to characterize the geometrical dependence of noncovalent interactions and not only focus on binding energies of minimum energy structures. Despite the fact that potential energy curves for noncovalent interactions are shallower than those for covalent bonds, the noncovalent interactions are still very sensitive to geometric parameters and their strengths can often vary significantly with small geometric perturbations. This geometric sensitivity can have a tremendous influence on the structures and stabilities of proteins and nucleic acid compounds (DNA/RNA) and may be a large factor in determining whether a ligand (such as a hormone or pharmaceutical compound) successfully binds to a protein receptor. The dynamic properties of biomolecules and nanomolecular structures can be strongly affected by geometrical noncovalent properties, and formulating a deeper understanding of the behavior of these interactions as a function of spatial parameters can give us insights into the dynamics of many types of systems. One case where the accurate treatment of interactions at all points on the potential energy surface is very important is in the interpretation of vibrational (infrared) spectra of peptides, proteins, and nucleic acid compounds. Studying the geometry dependence of noncovalent interactions at a very high level for a variety of interaction types is important because it establishes reference data that can be used to assess the performance of lower level methods in terms of their ability to converge to the geometric energy minimum. This last point is very important because the structures obtained at these lower levels are often used for high-level binding energy analyses and because lower level theory is often used to obtain theoretical infrared spectra, which can potentially be useful in assigning peaks in experimentally obtained spectra. Finally, although interactions at long ranges are generally very weak, they can play a key role in complexes of extended systems where the number of contacts at these distances grows very quickly; this point is particularly significant for complex molecular systems.
