[1] "The performances of several methods, MP2, SCS-CCSD, SCS-MP2, SCSN-MP2, SCS(MI)-MP2, M05-2X, M06-2X, B3LYP-D, and PBE-D, were evaluated relative to the new benchmark data."

[2] "Among the methods tested, MP2, as might be expected, proved to give the best values for all H-bond properties considered in the study."

[3] "Local methods converge very quickly with basis set size and, thus, should exhibit a small BSSE when reasonably large basis sets are employed."

[4] "The use of empirical force fields has been shown to be limited mainly due to assignment of atomic charges."

[5] "In a thorough investigation Hobza, de Vries, and co-workers used a large number of computational methods, as well as infrared spectroscopic techniques, to characterize the conformational stabilities of the GFA peptide."

The computational methods that were evaluated relative to new benchmark data included MP2, SCS-CCSD, SCS-MP2, SCSN-MP2, SCS(MI)-MP2, M05-2X, M06-2X, B3LYP-D, and PBE-D. Among the methods tested, MP2 provided the best values for all hydrogen bond properties considered in the study. Local methods, which converge quickly with basis set size, should exhibit a small basis set superposition error (BSSE) when reasonably large basis sets are used. The use of empirical force fields is limited due to issues with the assignment of atomic charges. Hobza, de Vries, and co-workers used a large number of computational methods and infrared spectroscopic techniques to characterize the conformational stabilities of the GFA peptide.

对新基准数据进行了评估的方法包括MP2、SCS-CCSD、SCS-MP2、SCSN-MP2、SCS(MI)-MP2、M05-2X、M06-2X、B3LYP-D和PBE-D。在测试的所有方法中，MP2为所有考虑的氢键性质提供了最佳值。当使用合理大小的基组时，局部方法应该表现出较小的基组超位误差（BSSE）。由于原子电荷分配问题，经验力场的应用受到限制。Hobza、de Vries及其同事使用了大量的计算方法和红外光谱技术来表征GFA肽的构象稳定性。
