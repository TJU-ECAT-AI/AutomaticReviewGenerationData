[1] "Proper damping is a crucial part of a transferable and general DFT-D approach."
[2] "At the equilibrium geometries, damping takes off roughly around 15% of the dispersion contribution in the case of dispersion-bonded complexes, but up to 90% in the case of the hydrogen-bonded complexes."
[3] "The overall behavior of damping and even the total dispersion contribution are more sensitive to the radius scaling than to the C6 scaling."
[4] "Inclusion of higher order dispersion coefficients does somewhat improve the overall DFT-D results."
[5] "Knowing this, it seems rather surprising that the most common empirical dispersion schemes perform so well."
[6] "In this respect, a damping function that is very steep at short distances and rather flat at intermediate and long distances works much better."

1. Damping plays a crucial role in the DFT-D approach, affecting the dispersion contribution differently in dispersion-bonded and hydrogen-bonded complexes.
2. Damping sensitivity varies between different types of complexes, with hydrogen-bonded complexes showing a higher sensitivity.
3. Radius scaling impacts the behavior of damping more significantly than C6 scaling.
4. Higher order dispersion coefficients can enhance the accuracy of DFT-D calculations.
5. The performance of common empirical dispersion schemes is surprisingly good, considering the limitations of their theoretical foundation.
6. A damping function with a steep slope at short distances and a flat slope at intermediate and long distances is beneficial for achieving better results.
