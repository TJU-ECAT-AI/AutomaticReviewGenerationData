[1] "Proper damping is a crucial part of a transferable and general DFT-D approach."
[2] "This means that the balance between complexes with different interaction types is very sensitive to the extent of damping."
[3] "In our experience, the overall behavior of damping and even the total dispersion contribution are more sensitive to the radius scaling than to the C6 scaling."
[4] "The shape of the damping function is also important."
[5] "DFT-D calculations on larger molecules, such as polypeptides, show that if the intramolecular dispersion is not included, the energy ordering of conformers is wrong, but after inclusion of the dispersion correction it becomes much better."
[6] "Knowing this, it seems rather surprising that the most common empirical dispersion schemes perform so well."
[7] "Nonetheless, they provide dispersion energies that are quite accurate, which can be explained either by error cancellation or by the small importance of the missing components."
[8] "This all points to the conclusion that inclusion of the intramolecular dispersion correction is not only useful, but probably also theoretically sound."
[9] "An interesting way to calculate the dispersion energy was suggested by Silvestrelli."
[10] "The method is perturbative; the electron density is not consistent with the dispersion interactions."

1. Proper damping is essential for a successful transferable and general DFT-D approach. 
2. The balance between complexes with different interaction types is highly sensitive to the degree of damping.
3. Our experience indicates that damping behavior and total dispersion contribution are more influenced by radius scaling than by C6 scaling.
4. The shape of the damping function plays a significant role in the accuracy of DFT-D calculations.
5. Including intramolecular dispersion correction greatly improves the energy ordering of conformers in larger molecules like polypeptides.
6. Surprisingly, common empirical dispersion schemes yield accurate results despite their simplicity.
7. The accuracy of these schemes can be attributed to error cancellation or the minor role of missing components.
8. The inclusion of intramolecular dispersion correction is theoretically justified and practically beneficial.
9. Silvestrelli suggested a method for calculating dispersion energy using the C6 dispersion term.
10. This method is perturbative, implying the electron density is not consistent with dispersion interactions.
