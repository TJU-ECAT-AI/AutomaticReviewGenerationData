<p>The new algorithm corrects systematic deviations from the true Bader surface, calculated by the original method, and does not require explicit representation of the interatomic surfaces, resulting in a more robust method of partitioning charge density among atoms in the system.</p>
<p>Applications of the method to some small systems are given, and it is further demonstrated how the method can be used to define an energy per atom in ab initio calculations.</p>
<p>The CPU time required by the improved algorithm to perform the Bader analysis scales linearly with the number of interatomic surfaces in the system.</p>
<p>Compared with the original grid-based algorithm, the reported algorithm was also shown to be relatively insensitive to the rotation of the coordinate system of the mesh.</p>

The improved grid-based algorithm for Bader charge allocation enhances the accuracy of atomic property calculations by correcting systematic deviations from the true Bader surface. It does not require explicit representation of interatomic surfaces, offering a more robust method for partitioning charge density among atoms. The algorithm scales linearly with the number of interatomic surfaces, making it efficient for larger systems. It is insensitive to the rotation of the coordinate system, ensuring consistent results regardless of the mesh orientation. The method enables the definition of an energy per atom in ab initio calculations, facilitating the analysis of small systems and potentially contributing to the development of new catalytic materials.
