[1] "The CPU time required by the new algorithm to perform the Bader analysis is plotted against the total number of interatomic surfaces present in all of the molecules studied."
[2] "The CPU time required to calculate the density and gradient arrays were not included in this data."
[3] "These calculations indicated excellent agreement between the interpolated and directly-evaluated gradient vector methods, validating the interpolation scheme."
[4] "Compared with the original grid-based algorithm, the reported algorithm was also shown to be relatively insensitive to the rotation of the coordinate system of the mesh."
[5] "This implies that, for larger systems, the algorithm scales linearly with respect to the total number of atoms."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing accurate and efficient simulations. Key considerations involve ensuring the models accurately capture the electronic structure and dynamics of the catalyst and substrate interactions. Challenges include dealing with complex geometries and dynamic environments, while potential benefits include the ability to screen and design new catalytic materials with enhanced activity and selectivity. The document shows that the new algorithm scales linearly with the number of interatomic surfaces, making it efficient for larger systems, and validates the cubic interpolation scheme for gradient vectors, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to direct evaluation.
