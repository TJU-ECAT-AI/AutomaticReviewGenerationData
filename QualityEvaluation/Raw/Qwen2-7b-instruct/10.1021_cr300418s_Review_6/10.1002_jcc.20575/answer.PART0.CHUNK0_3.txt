[4] "It was shown that a cubic gradient interpolation scheme yields nearly the same results as a direct gradient evaluation scheme, but requires only approximately 20% of the CPU time."
[5] "The algorithm scales linearly with respect to the total number of interatomic surfaces in the system."
[6] "This implies that, for larger systems, the algorithm scales linearly with respect to the total number of atoms in the system."
[7] "A series of molecular calculations was presented, comparing the performance of the algorithm, using both direct gradient vector evaluation, and a cubic interpolation scheme."
