[1] "The properties of chemicals and materials are often described in terms of charge transfer between atoms and the presence of ionic charges or electric multipoles on atoms or molecules."
[2] "The most commonly used orbital based method is the so-called Mulliken analysis. It can be applied when basis functions centered on atoms are used in the calculation of the electronic wavefunction of the system."
[3] "A different approach is to focus entirely on the charge density as has been proposed by Bader [2]."
[4] "Space is divided into regions by surfaces that run through minima in the charge density."
[5] "The computational effort, therefore, scales linearly with the number of grid points and is independent of the number of atoms in the system."
[6] "The method was tested by assigning charges to atoms in a water molecule and in a NaCl crystal. Our results agree well with results obtained with other Bader analysis algorithms."
[7] "We have, furthermore, used the method to analyze electrical activity of a three-atom boron cluster in a silicon crystal, B3I. The cluster was found to have a charge of 1.5 e which indicates half as large electrical activity as compared with three substitutional boron atoms."
