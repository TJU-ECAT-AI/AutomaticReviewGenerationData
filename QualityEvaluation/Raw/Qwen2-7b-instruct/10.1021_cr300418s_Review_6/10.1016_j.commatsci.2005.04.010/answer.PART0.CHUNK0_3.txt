<p>Although the dividing surfaces are not found explicitly,it is easy to render them for visualization after the anal- ysis is complete.</p>
<p>The algorithm is robust since dividing surfaces and critical points do not need to be found explicitly.</p>
<p>The number of arithmetic operations per grid point in our algorithm is insensitive to the size of the grid and the number of atoms in the system so the computational effort scales linearly with the number of grid points used in the representation of the electron density.</p>
<p>This grid based analysis is highly efficient. Since the steepest ascent paths get terminated when a previously assigned point has been reached, there is a fixed amount of work required for each grid point.</p>
<p>The time it takes to carry out the analysis is on the order of the time it takes to read in the electron density grid data from the computers hard disk.</p>
<p>The method was tested by assigning charges to atoms in a water molecule and in a NaCl crystal. Our re- sults agree well with results obtained with other Bader analysis algorithms.</p>
<p>We have, furthermore, used the method to analyze electrical activity of a three-atom boron cluster in a silicon crystal, B3I. The cluster was found to have a charge of 1.5 e which indicates half as large electrical activity as compared with three substi- tutional boron atoms.</p>
