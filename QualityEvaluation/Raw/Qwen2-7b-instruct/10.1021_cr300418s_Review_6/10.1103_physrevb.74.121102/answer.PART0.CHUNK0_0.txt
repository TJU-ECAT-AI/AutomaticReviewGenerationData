[1] "The prediction of energy landscapes from density functional theory DFT has often lacked the predictive power necessary to quantitatively anticipate experimental results such as phase diagrams and properties of point defects."
[2] "This predictive capability is most needed when experiments are unable to measure desired properties directly, for example indirect probes of the existence and behavior of point defects has led to disagreements regarding the individual contributions of interstitial and vacancy defects to self-diffusion."
[3] "Without quantitative predictions of point defect properties, the modeling of larger-scale phenomena, such as dopant profiles in Si or microstructure in an irradiated material, will be inadequate."
[4] "Higher computational accuracy can be achieved with the diffusion Monte Carlo DMC approach, although at a greater computational expense. DMC calculations have been performed on key structures, and past work has shown that DMC calculations on interstitial defects in Si find formation energies that are significantly higher than those from DFT with the GGA and thus closer to experimental estimates."
[5] "A computational method that combines the relative ease of DFT computations with the accuracy of DMC simulation is certainly needed in order to obtain quantitative predictive power of what would be very difficult experiments."
[6] "In this work two of the latest generation of DFT functionals are compared to highly converged DMC calculations of point defects in solid silicon, and the relative energy between two phases of silicon, the diamond phase and -tin, which is metallic."
[7] "The functionals to be examined are the meta-GGAs, which extend the expansion of the exchange-correlation energy to include the kinetic energy density, and a hybrid functional, which contains a portion of the full, nonlocal, Hartree-Fock-type exchange."
[8] "We find a steady improvement in the quality of the results as we progress along the rungs of Perdew's Jacobs ladder to DFT heaven. In fact, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional is found to give results in excellent agreement with our DMC benchmark."
[9] "The HSE functional has the advantage over previous hybrid functionals of being applicable for systems with a metallic band structure."
[10] "Somewhat surprisingly, we have recently demonstrated that it provides band gaps in good agreement with experiment for a benchmark set of 40 semiconductors."
[11] "Our slightly lower energy for the -tin phase might be related to the use of the improved energy optimization method for the trial wave function."
[12] "While the parameters of the hybrid functional that control the fraction of exact exchange interaction and the screening function are adjusted to reproduce molecular bond energies, this result shows the excellent applicability of this functional to the solid phase."
[13] "After establishing the accuracy of the HSE functional for crystalline solids, we examine the different density functionals on interstitial defect configurations in the diamond phase."
[14] "The HSE functional yields interstitial formation energies that agree significantly better with both DMC and experimental results than do the energies obtained from the LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA."
[15] "Our results on defects are especially noteworthy as radiation damage and the resultant point defects play an important role in the properties of these technologically important materials."

Answering the first question requires understanding the capabilities of density functional theory (DFT) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods in predicting the properties of materials, specifically focusing on the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. The key considerations involve the predictive power of DFT in comparison to experimental results, particularly in terms of phase diagrams and properties of point defects. Challenges arise from the limitations of DFT in accurately predicting certain properties, leading to disagreements in interpreting experimental data, such as the behavior of point defects in materials like silicon. Efficiency is another challenge, as DMC methods, though more accurate, require significantly greater computational resources. However, combining the ease of DFT computations with the accuracy of DMC simulations offers a solution to these issues, enabling more precise predictions of complex systems' properties.

The potential benefits of these computational methods lie in their ability to enhance the understanding and design of new catalytic materials. By improving the accuracy of predictions, researchers can more effectively model and optimize the behavior of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation processes. This leads to advancements in chemical reactions, energy conversion, and environmental technologies, where the performance of catalysts plays a critical role.

Answering the second question necessitates examining the specific functionals used in DFT, namely the meta-GGAs and the hybrid functional (Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE). These functionals extend the expansion of the exchange-correlation energy to include the kinetic energy density and incorporate a portion of the nonlocal Hartree-Fock-type exchange, respectively. Their application allows for more accurate predictions of material properties, particularly in systems with metallic band structures. The HSE functional, in particular, stands out for its ability to deliver accurate molecular energies and band gaps, comparable to experimental data, making it suitable for studying various materials, including silicon and semiconductors. The improved energy optimization method utilized in the HSE functional contributes to its enhanced applicability, especially in predicting the behavior of point defects and their effects on material properties.

In summary, computational methods like DFT and DMC offer significant advantages in predicting and understanding the properties of materials, particularly in the context of catalytic activity. These methods enable more accurate modeling of complex systems, facilitating the development of new materials with optimized performance for various applications. The choice of appropriate functionals, such as meta-GGAs and the HSE hybrid functional, is crucial in enhancing the predictive capabilities of DFT, thereby supporting advancements in chemistry, materials science, and related fields.
