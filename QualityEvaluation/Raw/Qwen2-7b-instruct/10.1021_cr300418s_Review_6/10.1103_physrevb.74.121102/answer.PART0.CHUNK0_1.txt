[1] "The prediction of energy landscapes from density functional theory DFT has often lacked the predictive power necessary to quantitatively anticipate experimental results such as phase diagrams and properties of point defects."
[2] "For example, for both Si and Ge, two group-IV semiconductors, the LDA and GGA predict self-diffusion activation energies that are about 1.5 and 1 eV lower, respectively, than experimental measurements."
[3] "This problem is eliminated with the screening introduced in the HSE functional, allowing us to simulate not only the semiconductor phases of silicon but also the -tin phase, which is metallic, and point defects, which introduce energy levels in the gap region."
[4] "The origin of this is likely the improved description of covalent bonds by the HSE functional which results in a more accurate energy for the covalently bound diamond phase."
[5] "The HSE functional yields interstitial formation energies that agree significantly better with both DMC and experimental results than do the energies obtained from the LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA."

The computational methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT), enable more precise predictions of phase diagrams and properties of point defects, addressing the limitations of traditional methods like the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximations (GGA). For instance, the LDA and GGA underestimate the self-diffusion activation energies of semiconductors like Si and Ge by 1.5 and 1 eV, respectively, compared to experimental measurements. The introduction of screening in the hybrid functional, particularly the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional, facilitates the simulation of metallic phases and point defects with improved accuracy. This is due to the enhanced description of covalent bonds in the diamond phase, leading to a more accurate energy calculation. Moreover, the HSE functional provides significantly better agreement with both diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations and experimental results for interstitial defect formation energies, surpassing the predictions made by the LDA, GGA, and meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGA).

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT），能够更精确地预测相图和点缺陷的性质，解决了传统方法如局部密度近似（LDA）和广义梯度近似（GGA）的局限性。例如，对于Si和Ge这样的第四主族半导体，LDA和GGA分别将自扩散激活能低估了1.5和1eV，与实验测量结果相比。引入筛选机制的混合函数，尤其是Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof（HSE）函数，使我们不仅能够模拟硅的半导体相，还能模拟金属相和引入带隙区域能级的点缺陷，提高了准确性。这得益于对金刚石相中共价键的改进描述，导致了更准确的能量计算。此外，HSE函数在与DMC计算和实验结果一致方面提供了显著更好的表现，对于间隙缺陷形成能的预测优于LDA、GGA和元广义梯度近似（meta-GGA）。
