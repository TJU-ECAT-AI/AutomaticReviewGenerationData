[1] "Consequently, there is a need for high-level electronic structure calculations for reliable predictions of enzyme reactivity."
[2] "Only the substrate(s) and relevant residues in the active site are treated quantum mechanically, the rest of the protein is described at the empirical MM level."
[3] "Semiempirical methods, though applicable to large systems, are generally not accurate enough because computed free energies of activation may have an error of ten or more kcalmol−1."
[4] "DFT (especially with the B3LYP functional5) offers improved accuracy but still lacks key physical interactions (e.g., dispersion)."
[5] "Often, DFT underestimates barrier heights by several kcalmol−1, which cannot be systematically improved."
[6] "This accuracy is unprecedented and was previously difficult to achieve even for small molecules."
[7] "The agreement with experimental results indicates that transition-state theory provides a good general framework for understanding the rates of such enzyme-catalyzed reactions."

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of enzymes by providing high-level electronic structure calculations for reliable predictions of enzyme reactivity. In contrast to semiempirical methods, DFT offers improved accuracy in predicting activation enthalpies and free energies, although it still lacks certain physical interactions like dispersion. This accuracy is unprecedented, especially for large enzyme systems, and allows for quantitative studies of reaction mechanisms in enzymes. The agreement between computational predictions and experimental results indicates that transition-state theory provides a robust framework for understanding the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过提供高级电子结构计算以可靠预测酶活性，增强了我们对酶催化活性的预测、分析和理解的能力。与半经验方法相比，DFT在预测激活焓和自由能方面提供了改进的准确性，尽管它仍然缺乏某些物理相互作用，如分散力。这种准确性是前所未有的，尤其是在大型酶系统中，并允许对酶催化反应机制进行定量研究。与实验结果的一致性表明，过渡态理论为理解酶催化反应速率提供了一个稳健的框架。
