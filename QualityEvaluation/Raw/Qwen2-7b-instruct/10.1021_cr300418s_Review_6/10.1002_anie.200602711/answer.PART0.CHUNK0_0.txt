[1] "Unfortunately, the overall importance of these effects for the effective reaction rate is difficult (if not impossible) to determine experimentally."
[2] "Semiempirical methods, though applicable to large systems, are generally not accurate enough because computed free energies of activation may have an error of ten or more kcalmol1."
[3] "DFT (especially with the B3LYP functional5) offers improved accuracy but still lacks key physical interactions (e.g., dispersion)."
[4] "Often, DFT underestimates barrier heights by several kcalmol1, which cannot be systematically improved."
[5] "Consequently, there is a need for high-level electronic structure calculations for reliable predictions of enzyme reactivity."
[6] "In the present study, we use these new high-level local correlation methods in QM/MM calculations on two biochemically well-characterized enzymes, chorismate mutase (CM) and para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH)."
[7] "Combining the ab initio results with thorough sampling, we predict activation enthalpies that approach chemical accuracy."
[8] "These results indicate that a high-level electron correlation treatment, such as LCCSD(T0), is necessary to make quantitative predictions of barrier heights or other energetic properties in enzymes."
[9] "Our high-level QM/MM calculations provide near-quantitative results for the activation enthalpies and free energies of the reactions catalyzed by CM and PHBH."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing more accurate predictions of barrier heights and energetic properties compared to semiempirical methods. Key considerations include the accuracy of the electronic structure theory, the efficiency of the computational methods, and the exploration of new catalytic materials. Challenges involve the limitations of DFT in accurately representing certain interactions like dispersion, while cluster models can offer insights into specific reaction mechanisms but may lack the broader context provided by DFT. Potential benefits include the ability to perform quantitative studies of reaction mechanisms, which can guide the design of new catalysts and improve our understanding of catalytic processes.

这些计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过提供与半经验方法相比更准确的预测屏障高度和能量性质的能力，增强了我们对掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃活化中的催化活性的预测、分析和理解。关键考虑因素包括电子结构理论的准确性、计算方法的效率以及探索新催化材料的可能性。挑战包括DFT在准确表示某些交互如散射方面的局限性，而簇模型可以提供特定反应机制的见解，但可能缺乏DFT提供的更广泛的上下文。潜在的好处包括能够进行反应机制的定量研究，这可以指导新催化剂的设计并增进我们对催化过程的理解。
