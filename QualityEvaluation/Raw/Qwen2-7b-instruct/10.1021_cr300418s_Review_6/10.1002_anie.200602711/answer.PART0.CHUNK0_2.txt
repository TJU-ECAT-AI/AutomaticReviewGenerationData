[1] "Consequently, there is a need for high-level electronic structure calculations for reliable predictions of enzyme reactivity."
[2] "Only the substrate(s) and relevant residues in the active site are treated quantum mechanically, the rest of the protein is described at the empirical MM level."
[3] "Semiempirical methods, though applicable to large systems, are generally not accurate enough because computed free energies of activation may have an error of ten or more kcalmol1."
[4] "DFT (especially with the B3LYP functional5) offers improved accuracy but still lacks key physical interactions (e.g., dispersion)."
[5] "Often, DFT underestimates barrier heights by several kcalmol1, which cannot be systematically improved."
[6] "These studies indicate that the computed LCCSD(T0) barrier heights are likely to agree with the full CCSD(T) values at the basis-set limit to within 1 kcalmol1."

The document discusses how computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of enzymes. DFT methods offer improvements over semiempirical methods in accuracy, yet still lack certain physical interactions like dispersion. The LCCSD(T0) calculations, employing local approximations and an approximate treatment of the triples correction, are highlighted as providing barrier heights that closely agree with experimental results, indicating the necessity of high-level electron correlation treatments for making quantitative predictions in enzymatic reactions. The key considerations involve balancing accuracy with computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large systems. The benefits include the potential for near-quantitative results that allow for detailed studies of reaction mechanisms in enzymes, opening new avenues for theoretical biochemistry and computational chemistry.

文档讨论了计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，如何增强我们预测、分析和理解酶催化活性的能力。DFT方法在准确性上优于半经验方法，但仍然缺乏某些物理相互作用，如分散作用。通过局部近似和三重修正的近似处理的LCCSD(T0)计算被强调为能够提供与实验结果高度一致的势垒高度，这表明在酶催化的反应中进行定量预测需要高阶电子相关处理。关键考虑因素涉及在保证精度的同时平衡计算效率，尤其是在处理大型系统时。这些好处包括可能实现接近定量的结果，允许对酶内反应机制进行详细的研究，从而为理论生物化学和计算化学开辟新的途径。
