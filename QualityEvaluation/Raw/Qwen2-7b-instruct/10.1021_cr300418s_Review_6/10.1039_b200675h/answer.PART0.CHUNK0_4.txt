[1] "In parallel with the work of one of us in this area,2 an important factor over the last few years in making practicing transition metal chemists aware of the importance of spin- forbidden reactions has been the work of Schrder, Schwarz and Shaik on Two-State Reactivity (TSR).3 This concept was first introduced to rationalize unexpected reactivity trends in gas- phase reactions such as the oxidation of hydrogen by the iron oxide cation, FeO+. Spin changes between sextet and quartet states at different points along the reaction coordinate were needed to account for the observed reactivity: these spin-"

[2] "The problem is that the exact functional is unknown, and the many different approximate functionals tend to give different results. For example, the state-splitting in methylene can vary from ca. 10 kcal mol21, with the B3LYP functional, to as much as 17.5 kcal mol21 with the B3PW91 method.24 Given that the experimental value is 9.4 kcal mol21, B3LYP is in this case well within our desired accuracy bracket,whereas the other functional is not."

[3] "We believe that the spreading awareness of the role and importance of spin changes in transition metal chemistry, as well as the availability of robust computational techniques for characterising the appropriate MECPs, will help to deepen the level of understanding in this area of mechanistic chemistry."

1. The concept of Two-State Reactivity (TSR), introduced by Schrder, Schwarz and Shaik, has been crucial in making practicing transition metal chemists aware of the significance of spin-forbidden reactions. This concept was initially used to explain unexpected reactivity patterns in gas-phase reactions, such as the oxidation of hydrogen by iron oxide cation, where spin changes between sextet and quartet states along the reaction coordinate were necessary to account for the observed reactivity.

2. Determining the exact functional in density functional theory (DFT) is a challenge since various approximations lead to different outcomes. For instance, the state-splitting in methylene varies significantly depending on the functional used. The B3LYP method provides results within the desired accuracy bracket, while other functionals may not. 

3. The growing recognition of the role and importance of spin changes in transition metal chemistry, coupled with advanced computational methods for identifying minimum energy crossing points (MECPs), is expected to enhance understanding in the field of mechanistic chemistry.

1. 由Schrder、Schwarz和Shaik提出的两状态反应（TSR）概念，在过去几年中对过渡金属化学家认识到禁戒态反应的重要性起到了重要作用。这一概念最初被用于解释气体相反应中氢氧化铁离子氧化的意外反应性趋势，需要在反应坐标的不同点上进行六重态到四重态的自旋变化来解释观察到的反应性：这些是需要的自旋变化。

2. 在密度泛函理论（DFT）中确定精确的功能是挑战性的，因为各种近似导致不同的结果。例如，甲烷的能级分裂在使用不同方法时会有显著差异。B3LYP方法提供的结果在预期的精度范围内，而其他方法可能不在此范围内。

3. 过渡金属化学中自旋变化的作用和重要性的日益认识，以及用于识别最低能量交叉点（MECP）的先进计算方法的可用性，预计将加深对该领域机理化学的理解。
