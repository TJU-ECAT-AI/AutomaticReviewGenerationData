[1] "Critical for triggering a gas response are not the lattice oxygen concentration but chemisorbed (or iono- sorbed) oxygen and other molecules with a net electric charge."
[2] "Band bending induced by charged molecules cause the increase or decrease in surface conductivity responsible for the gas response signal."

Additives in tin oxide modify the gas sensing and catalytic properties by altering the surface composition and electronic structure. These modifications are crucial for triggering a gas response. The response is not directly influenced by the lattice oxygen concentration but rather by chemisorbed or ionosorbed oxygen and other charged molecules. Band bending caused by these charged molecules leads to changes in surface conductivity, which is responsible for the gas response signal.

添加物通过改变表面组成和电子结构来调整锡氧化物的气体传感和催化性能。这些修改对于触发气体响应至关重要。响应并不直接由晶格氧浓度决定，而是由吸附或离子吸附的氧以及其他带电分子影响。由这些带电分子引起的带弯曲导致表面导电性的变化，这是气体响应信号的原因。
