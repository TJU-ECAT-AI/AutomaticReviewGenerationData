[1] "In most applications tin oxide is modified by additives to either increase the charge carrier concentration by donor atoms, or to increase the gas sensitivity or the catalytic activity by metal additives."
[2] "Some of the basic concepts by which additives modify the gas sensing and catalytic properties of SnO2 are discussed and the few surface science studies of doped SnO2 are reviewed."

Additives play a crucial role in modifying the gas sensing and catalytic properties of tin oxide. They can either increase the charge carrier concentration through the presence of donor atoms or enhance the gas sensitivity and catalytic activity by incorporating metal additives. Surface science studies on doped tin oxide have provided insights into how these modifications occur.
