[1] "Critical for triggering a gas response are not the lattice oxygen concentration but chemisorbed (or iono- sorbed) oxygen and other molecules with a net electric charge."
[2] "Band bending induced by charged molecules cause the increase or decrease in surface conductivity responsible for the gas response signal."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by focusing on the interaction of charged molecules with the surface. These methods allow for the prediction of band bending caused by charged molecules, which is crucial for understanding the increase or decrease in surface conductivity responsible for the gas response signal. Key considerations include the accuracy of the models in predicting the electronic structure of the catalyst surface, the efficiency of computational resources required for complex simulations, and the exploration of new catalytic materials through virtual screening.
