[1] "Adiabatic Correlation Rules for Reactions Involving Polyatomic Intermediate Complexes and their Application to the Formation of OH(2Σ+) in the H2O2 Flame Kurt E. Shuler"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The document discusses adiabatic correlation rules for reactions involving polyatomic intermediate complexes, specifically focusing on the formation of OH(2Σ+) in the H2O2 flame. It explains how these rules can be applied to determine the adiabatically allowed term manifold of reaction products from the states of the separated reactants without considering their detailed electronic configurations. The rules are derived using group theoretical arguments related to the symmetry properties of reactants, intermediate complexes, and products. The document also applies these correlation rules to study the reactions H + O2 and O + H2, suggesting that the interaction of OH intermediates and the consequent radiationless transition between them is primarily responsible for the formation of OH(2+) in its observed vibrational nonequilibrium distribution.
