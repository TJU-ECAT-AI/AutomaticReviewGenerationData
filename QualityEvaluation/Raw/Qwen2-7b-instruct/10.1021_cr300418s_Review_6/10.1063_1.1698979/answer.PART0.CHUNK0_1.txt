The study reveals that shock fronts in argon at Mach 2 are thicker than predicted by existing theories, except for Zoller's, which matches the experimental data. Nitrogen's rotational energy quickly reaches equilibrium, but evidence suggests that at least two relaxation times are needed to accurately describe the process. Oxygen behaves similarly to nitrogen, possibly with a slightly longer relaxation time, and it also seems to require two relaxation times.

研究发现，马赫2的氩气冲击波厚度比现有理论预测的任何情况都要大，除了Zoller的预测，其与实验误差相符。氮的转动能量迅速达到平衡，但有证据表明至少需要两个松弛时间来描述这一过程。氧的行为类似于氮，可能稍微长一些的松弛时间，并且它似乎也需要两个松弛时间。
