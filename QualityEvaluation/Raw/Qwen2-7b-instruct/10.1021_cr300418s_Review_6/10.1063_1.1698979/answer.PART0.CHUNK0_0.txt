[1] "Adiabatic Correlation Rules for Reactions Involving Polyatomic Intermediate Complexes and their Application to the Formation of OH(2Σ+) in the H2O2 Flame"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The document discusses adiabatic correlation rules applicable to reactions involving polyatomic intermediate complexes, specifically focusing on the formation of OH(2Σ+) in the H2O2 flame. The rules are formulated to determine the adiabatically allowed term manifold of reaction products from the states of separated reactants, utilizing group theoretical arguments related to the symmetry properties of reactants, intermediate complexes, and products. The effects of changes in the geometric configuration of the intermediate reaction complex and electronic-vibrational coupling on these correlations are considered, concluding that strict orbital electronic correlation rules are operative only for reactions where neither reactants nor products are polyatomic.

文档讨论了涉及多原子中间复合物的反应的绝热关联规则，特别是OH(2Σ+)在H2O2火焰中的形成。这些规则被制定出来，以确定从分离反应物的状态中反应产物的绝热允许态簇，利用与反应物、中间复合物和产物的对称性属性相关的群论论点。考虑到中间反应复合物几何构型的变化和电子振动耦合对这些关联的影响，结论是，只有当反应物和产品都不是多原子时，才存在严格的轨道电子关联规则。
