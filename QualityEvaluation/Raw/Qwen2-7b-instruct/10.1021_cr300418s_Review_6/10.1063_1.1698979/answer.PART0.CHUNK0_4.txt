1. Shock fronts in argon at Mach 2 are thicker than predicted by Zoller's theory, matching experimental errors.
2. Hydrogen behaves like a monoatomic gas in a Mach 1.4 shock with minimal rotational excitation, while nitrogen's rotational energy is quickly balanced but requires at least two relaxation times for description. Oxygen behaves similarly to nitrogen but possibly with a slightly longer relaxation time needing two relaxation times.
3. The main issue lies in creating orbital correlation rules.
4. For reactions with atomic or diatomic reactants and products, vibronic and electronic correlations yield identical outcomes, eliminating the need to consider vibrational-electronic interactions explicitly.
5. In reactions with polyatomic reactants, the least symmetrical complex (LSC) typically lacks symmetry, imposing few or no restrictions on the adiabatically allowed product term manifold.
6. Direct formation of OH(2+) from 0 and H2 involves excited oxygen atoms, analogous to the H+O2 reaction.
7. Reactions (7) and (11), like many others, can produce products in an equilibrium distribution, but they fail to explain the specific enhancement of OH(2+) levels v' = 2 and 3.
8. The LSC for the O+H2 reaction is most likely of symmetry C, guiding the correlation between reactants and products.

1. 当马赫数为2时，氩的冲击前沿比Zoller理论预测的要厚，与实验误差相符。
2. 氢在马赫数1.4的冲击中表现为单原子气体，几乎没有旋转自由度的激发，而氮的旋转能迅速平衡，但至少需要两个松弛时间来描述过程。氧的行为类似于氮，可能稍长一些的松弛时间也需要两个松弛时间。
3. 主要问题在于制定轨道相关规则。
4. 对于仅涉及原子或双原子反应物和产物的反应，振动电子相关和电子相关产生相同的结果，无需考虑振动电子相互作用。
5. 对于涉及多原子反应物的反应，最不规则的复合体（LSC）通常缺乏对称性，对允许的产品术语范围施加很少或没有限制。
6. 直接从0和H2形成OH(2+)涉及激发的氧原子，类似于H+O2反应。
7. 反应（7）和（11），与其他许多反应一样，可能会产生某些类型的非平衡分布的产品，但它们无法解释OH(2+)的特定增强水平v'=2和3。
8. O+H2反应的LSC最有可能具有C对称性，指导反应物和产物之间的相关性。
