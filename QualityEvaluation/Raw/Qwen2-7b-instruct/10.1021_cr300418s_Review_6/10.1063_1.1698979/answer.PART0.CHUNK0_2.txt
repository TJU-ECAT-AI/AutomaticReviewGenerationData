The study found that shock fronts in argon at Mach 2 are thicker than predicted by existing theories, except for those by Zoller, which agree within experimental error. Hydrogen behaves like a monatomic gas in a shock of Mach 1.4, with minimal excitation of rotational degrees of freedom. Nitrogen quickly equilibrates rotational energy but requires at least two relaxation times to accurately describe the process. Oxygen acts similarly to nitrogen, possibly with a slightly longer relaxation time, and it too seems to necessitate two relaxation times.

研究发现，马赫2的氩冲击波前沿比现有的理论预测要厚，除了Zoller的理论预测，其结果与实验误差相符。氢在马赫数为1.4的冲击波中表现得像是单原子气体，旋转自由度的激发极小。氮迅速平衡了旋转能量，但至少需要两个松弛时间来准确描述这一过程。氧的行为类似于氮，可能稍微长一些的松弛时间，并且它似乎也需要两个松弛时间。

[1] "The only polyatomic species involved in the reaction whose vibronic states must be determined is the LSC and the only mode of vibration of this LSC which must be taken into account in establishing the vibronic correlations is the vibration along the reaction coordinate22 which brings about the breakup of the LSC into its separated constituents, i.e., the vibration which leads to reaction."
[2] "The only difference between an electronic and a vibronic correlation is then that for the latter, one uses the vibronic states of the LSC obtained by forming the direct product of the electronic representations and the vibrational species which leads to reaction."
[3] "The argument for the LSC follows along the lines given above in that only the vibrations along the reaction coordinate which lead to reaction need to be taken into account."
[4] "For the polyatomic reactants and/or products, however, all modes of vibration must be taken into consideration since their vibrational motions are independent of those of the LSC owing to the rearrangement of the vibrational energy during the reaction."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Only the least symmetrical complex (LSC) determines the vibronic states in the reaction, focusing on the vibration along the reaction coordinate, which causes the LSC to split into its constituent parts. In vibronic correlations, the vibronic states of the LSC are derived by multiplying its electronic representations with the vibration mode leading to reaction. For polyatomic reactants or products, all vibration modes must be considered because their vibrational motions are independent of the LSC's due to the redistribution of vibrational energy during the reaction.

仅最不规则的复合物（LSC）决定了反应中的振动模式，关注的是导致LSC分裂成其组成部分的反应坐标上的振动。在振动关系中，通过将LSC的电子表示与导致反应的振动模式相乘来获取LSC的振动模式。对于多原子反应物或产物，所有振动模式都必须考虑，因为它们的振动运动由于反应过程中振动能量的重新分配而独立于LSC。

[1] "It has, however, been shown by Teller36 that potential surfaces of polyatomic molecules of the same electronic species may cross since now two or more parameters (internuclear distances, bond angles) are available whose variation will be sufficient in all cases to produce a degeneracy of such electronic states and thus allow a crossing of the surfaces."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
However, it has been demonstrated by Teller36 that potential surfaces of polyatomic molecules with the same electronic species can intersect. This is possible because multiple parameters (inter-nuclear distances, bond angles) are available, allowing for the degeneracy of electronic states in all scenarios, which enables the surfaces to cross.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
然而，Teller36已经表明，具有相同电子物种的多原子分子的潜在表面可以相交。这是因为有多个参数（核间距，键角）可用，在所有情况下都可以产生电子状态的退化，从而允许表面相交。

[1] "While reactions (7) and (11), like many other chemical reactions, may well give rise to products in some type of nonequilibrium distribution, they cannot account for the very specific enhancement of the levels v' = 2 and 3 of OH(2+)."

Similar to many chemical reactions, reactions (7) and (11) might produce products in some non-equilibrium distribution. However, they are unable to explain the very specific enhancement of the OH(2+) levels v' = 2 and 3.

就像许多化学反应一样，反应（7）和（11）可能会产生某种非平衡分布的产品。然而，它们无法解释OH(2+)的非常特定的增强，即v'=2和3的水平。

[1] "For these types of dissociation (and association) reactions the large amplitUde of the oscillations in conjunction with the an- harmonicity of the potential energy will make for particularly effective interaction and coupling of the various normal modes of vibration."

For dissociation and association reactions of this kind, the large amplitude of oscillations combined with the anharmonicity of the potential energy leads to particularly effective interaction and coupling of the various normal vibration modes.
