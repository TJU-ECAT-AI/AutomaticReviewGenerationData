[1] "In order to study the underlying nonadiabatic potential-energy surfaces PESs, we present a locally constrained density-functional theory ap- proach, which enables us to confine electrons to subspaces of the Hilbert space, e.g., to selected atoms or groups of atoms."
[2] "The nuclei then appear static to the electrons, which in turn set up a potential governing the motion of the nuclei."
[3] "However, in real life electrons may not be able to follow the motion of the nuclei instantaneously, and,e.g., when selection rules apply, they may find themselves in an excited state."
[4] "For such, or alike situations it is necessary to go beyond the BOA and to consider the coupling between different states."
[5] "We account for the tendency to maintain a given character of the electronic structure, e.g., due to selec- tion rules, by focusing on the dynamics of a system with defined charge and spin in suitably chosen subsystems, typi- cally the two reactants in a scattering event."
[6] "The aim of this work is to develop and apply a nonadia- batic approach, with a similar physical motivation as the dia- baticity concept."
[7] "The constraint is enforced through an additional Lagrange multiplier, which on the level of the Kohn-Sham KS equations yields an additional term to the KS effective potential."
[8] "Still, the formal definition is different,and in some cases, such as the example of the O2/Al111 system discussed below, there are notable differences."
[9] "In contrast to recent other works in this area,12,13 we therefore prefer to refer to our states simply as nonadiabatic states to underscore this difference to the established diabaticity con- cept."
[10] "Still,spin-density functional theory, the Slater-Janak transition state,11,14,15 the fixed-spin moment FSM approach,16 and some other examples present frequently employed, impor- tant, and successful applications of essentially the same con- cept."
[11] "In a previous publication we have already used the present approach to resolve a long-standing problem in sur- face science, namely, the low-sticking probability of oxygen molecules at the Al111 surface."
[12] "However, the method is much more general, as we will illustrate below by also ap- plying it to two other, nonperiodic model systems, namely, a scattering event of a sodium and a chlorine atom, and the interaction of a Cl2 molecule with a magnesium cluster."
[13] "As in our approach this potential is determined in a self-consistent way using formally identical methodology, and has been employed to study charge- transfer reactions."
[14] "In order to assign electrons to the two subsystems, the Kohn-Sham single-particle wave functions are expanded into localized, atom-centered basis functions, e.g., Gaussians, Slater-type orbitals, or numerical orbitals."
[15] "We note that the nor- malization condition pA,i k+pB,i k=1 holds for each state i by construction, because each i,A k+ i,B k= i k is a normalized eigenstate."
[16] "In practice, we first align the Fermi energies separately for each spin."
[17] "This is particularly important when hybridiza- tion between the two subsystems is present and a single- particle state i contains nonzero expansion coefficients cij k for basis functions belonging to subsystem A, as well as for basis functions belonging to subsystem B."
[18] "Finally, for the systems with localized electronic states, we found that using the spins or electron numbers in the subsystems as convergence crite- rion for the self-consistency was sometimes preferred to the equality of the Fermi energies."
[19] "Overall, for the systems studied, the cost of the calculations using the constraint was thus often about the same and sometimes even lower than the cost of standard adiabatic calculations."

The document discusses the use of density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models to enhance the prediction, analysis, and understanding of catalytic activity in doped oxide catalysts for alkane activation. The key considerations, challenges, and potential benefits include:

1. The approach allows for confining electrons to specific subspaces of the Hilbert space, such as selected atoms or groups of atoms, enabling the study of nonadiabatic potential-energy surfaces (PESs) that are crucial for understanding the dynamics of catalytic reactions.
2. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), commonly used in chemistry, assumes that electrons react much faster than nuclei, leading to an instantaneous adjustment of electrons to the motion of nuclei. However, in real-life scenarios, electrons may not be able to react instantly, especially when selection rules apply.
3. Beyond the BOA, it is necessary to consider the coupling between different electronic states to account for nonadiabatic effects. This includes the dynamics of systems with defined charge and spin, focusing on the interaction between two reactants in a scattering event.
4. The document presents a nonadiabatic approach that accounts for the tendency to maintain a given electronic structure character, such as due to selection rules, by constraining the dynamics of systems with defined charge and spin.
5. The nonadiabatic states are computed using a locally constrained density-functional theory (LC-DFT) approach, which modifies the energy functional by applying physically meaningful constraints. This is achieved through the introduction of Lagrange multipliers, which enforce the constraints on the level of the Kohn-Sham equations.
6. The document highlights the importance of considering the formal definition of nonadiabatic states, which differs from the established diabaticity concept, and prefers to refer to the states simply as nonadiabatic states to emphasize this distinction.
7. The LC-DFT approach is a mild generalization of other constrained DFT applications, such as spin-density functional theory, the Slater-Janak transition state, and the fixed-spin moment (FSM) approach. It is designed to conserve electron numbers in specific subsystems, such as atoms or groups of atoms, and takes into account the spatial distribution of electrons and magnetization densities.
8. The method is applicable to a wide range of systems, including extended systems like surfaces and clusters, as well as nonperiodic model systems such as atom-molecule collisions.
9. The document mentions the successful application of the LC-DFT approach to resolve a long-standing problem in surface science, specifically the low sticking probability of oxygen molecules at the Al111 surface. It also demonstrates the method's broader applicability through examples of atom-molecule scattering events and interactions with clusters.
10. The nonadiabatic approach is designed to overcome limitations in describing chemical processes by controlling electron numbers, while accounting for approximations in the employed exchange-correlation functional. It is capable of accurately predicting the energy barriers and dynamics involved in catalytic reactions.
11. The computational cost of using the LC-DFT approach is often comparable to or even lower than that of standard adiabatic calculations, especially for systems with localized electronic states. The use of convergence criteria based on spins or electron numbers in subsystems can sometimes lead to more efficient self-consistent solutions.
12. The LC-DFT method offers several potential benefits, including enhanced accuracy in predicting nonadiabatic effects, better control over the spatial distribution of electrons and magnetization densities, and improved efficiency in computational calculations.

2. 在化学中常用的Born-Oppenheimer近似（BOA）假设电子反应速度远快于核，导致电子瞬间调整至核运动状态。然而，在现实生活中，电子可能无法立即反应，尤其是在存在选择规则时。
3. 超越BOA，需要考虑不同电子状态之间的耦合来处理非绝热效应。这包括关注具有定义电荷和自旋的系统动态，特别是聚焦于碰撞事件中的两个反应物。
4. 文档提出了一个非绝热方法，该方法通过约束局部密度泛函理论（LC-DFT）来考虑保持给定电子结构特征的趋势，如由于选择规则，这通过限制具有定义电荷和自旋的系统的动态实现。
5. LC-DFT方法通过引入拉格朗日乘数修改能量功能，应用物理上合理的约束。这在科恩-沙姆方程的层次上实现了约束条件。
6. 文档强调了非绝热状态与已建立的迪亚贝蒂概念的区别，并更倾向于将这些状态称为非绝热状态，以突出这一区别。
7. LC-DFT方法是其他受约束DFT应用（如自旋密度泛函理论、斯莱特-简克过渡态和固定自旋瞬变（FSM）方法）的温和推广。它旨在在原子或原子团等特定子系统中保持电子数量，并考虑电子和磁化密度的空间分布。
8. 方法适用于一系列系统，包括表面和簇等扩展系统，以及原子-分子碰撞等非周期模型系统。
9. 文档提到了LC-DFT方法成功应用于解决表面科学中的长期问题，具体为氧分子在Al111表面的低粘附概率。它还通过原子-分子散射事件和簇相互作用的示例展示了方法的广泛适用性。
10. LC-DFT方法旨在通过控制电子数量并考虑使用的交换相关函数的近似来准确预测化学过程，从而克服描述化学反应的局限性。
