The aim of this work is to develop and apply a nonadiabatic approach, with a similar physical motivation as the diabaticity concept. We account for the tendency to maintain a given character of the electronic structure, e.g., due to selection rules, by focusing on the dynamics of a system with defined charge and spin in suitably chosen subsystems, typically the two reactants in a scattering event. Using again the example of an O2 molecule, this could, e.g., be a state with fixed triplet spin on the molecule, even when it interacts with another reactant. Instead of using the properties of the many-body wave function as the formal basis, we thus build our approach on a defined total spin or total charge, or other well-defined quantity in the local Hilbert space of a chosen subsystem, which can be an atom or a group of atoms. The thus defined nonadiabatic PESs are computed with density-functional theory DFT,9,10 and, in particular, using the idea of constrained DFT formulated by Dederichs et al. in 1984.11 The basic idea is to modify the energy functional employed in DFT by applying physically meaningful constraints. The constraint is enforced through an additional Lagrange multiplier, which on the level of the Kohn-Sham KS equations yields an additional term to the KS effective potential.

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by allowing us to simulate and study complex chemical reactions and material properties with high accuracy and efficiency. DFT provides a quantum mechanical framework for understanding electronic structures and dynamics, enabling the prediction of catalytic activities based on the electronic configurations of the catalysts and substrates. Cluster models, on the other hand, offer a simplified yet powerful approach to simulate the interactions between catalysts and reactants at the atomic scale, facilitating the exploration of new catalytic materials and understanding of their performance.

Key considerations for using these methods include selecting appropriate parameters for the simulations, such as the size and composition of clusters, the choice of basis sets and exchange-correlation functionals in DFT, and ensuring sufficient sampling of the configurational space. Challenges arise from the computational demands of performing extensive simulations, especially for systems with many atoms, and from the need to interpret and validate the results against experimental data. Potential benefits include the ability to rapidly screen large libraries of candidate materials, optimize catalyst design, and gain insights into the mechanisms driving catalytic processes, which can guide the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic technologies.

[8] "Still, the formal definition is different,and in some cases, such as the example of the O2/Al111 system discussed below, there are notable differences."
[9] "In contrast to recent other works in this area,12,13 we therefore prefer to refer to our states simply as nonadiabatic states to underscore this difference to the established diabaticity con- cept."

The document discusses the use of density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models to enhance the prediction, analysis, and understanding of catalytic activity in doped oxide catalysts for alkane activation. The key considerations, challenges, and potential benefits include:

1. The approach allows for confining electrons to specific subspaces of the Hilbert space, such as selected atoms or groups of atoms, enabling the study of nonadiabatic potential-energy surfaces (PESs) that are crucial for understanding the dynamics of catalytic reactions.
2. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), commonly used in chemistry, assumes that electrons react much faster than nuclei, leading to an instantaneous adjustment of electrons to the motion of nuclei. However, in real-life scenarios, electrons may not be able to react instantly, especially when selection rules apply.
3. Beyond the BOA, it is necessary to consider the coupling between different electronic states to account for nonadiabatic effects. This includes the dynamics of systems with defined charge and spin, focusing on the interaction between two reactants in a scattering event.
4. The document presents a nonadiabatic approach that accounts for the tendency to maintain a given electronic structure character, such as due to selection rules, by constraining the dynamics of systems with defined charge and spin.
5. The nonadiabatic states are computed using a locally constrained density-functional theory (LC-DFT) approach, which modifies the energy functional by applying physically meaningful constraints. This is achieved through the introduction of Lagrange multipliers, which enforce the constraints on the level of the Kohn-Sham equations.
6. The document highlights the importance of considering the formal definition of nonadiabatic states, which differs from the established diabaticity concept, and prefers to refer to the states simply as nonadiabatic states to emphasize this distinction.
7. The LC-DFT approach is a mild generalization of other constrained DFT applications, such as spin-density functional theory, the Slater-Janak transition state, and the fixed-spin moment (FSM) approach. It is designed to conserve electron numbers in specific subsystems, such as atoms or groups of atoms, and takes into account the spatial distribution of electrons and magnetization densities.
8. The method is applicable to a wide range of systems, including extended systems like surfaces and clusters, as well as nonperiodic model systems such as atom-molecule collisions.
9. The document mentions the successful application of the LC-DFT approach to resolve a long-standing problem in surface science, specifically the low sticking probability of oxygen molecules at the Al111 surface. It also demonstrates the method's broader applicability through examples of atom-molecule scattering events and interactions with clusters.
10. The nonadiabatic approach is designed to overcome limitations in describing chemical processes by controlling electron numbers, while accounting for approximations in the employed exchange-correlation functional. It is capable of accurately predicting the energy barriers and dynamics involved in catalytic reactions.
11. The computational cost of using the LC-DFT approach is often comparable to or even lower than that of standard adiabatic calculations, especially for systems with localized electronic states. The use of convergence criteria based on spins or electron numbers in subsystems can sometimes lead to more efficient self-consistent solutions.
12. The LC-DFT method offers several potential benefits, including enhanced accuracy in predicting nonadiabatic effects, better control over the spatial distribution of electrons and magnetization densities, and improved efficiency in computational calculations.

文档讨论了密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型在多相催化中用于预测、分析和理解烷烃活化催化剂活性的方法。关键考虑因素、挑战和潜在优势包括：

1. 方法允许将电子限制在希尔伯特空间的特定子空间中，例如选定的原子或原子团，以研究对催化反应动态至关重要的非绝热势能表面（PES）。
2. 在化学中常用的Born-Oppenheimer近似（BOA）假设电子反应速度远快于核，导致电子瞬间调整至核运动状态。然而，在现实生活中，电子可能无法立即反应，尤其是在存在选择规则时。
3. 超越BOA，需要考虑不同电子状态之间的耦合来处理非绝热效应。这包括关注具有定义电荷和自旋的系统动态，特别是聚焦于碰撞事件中的两个反应物。
4. 文档提出了一个非绝热方法，该方法通过约束局部密度泛函理论（LC-DFT）来考虑保持给定电子结构特征的趋势，如由于选择规则，这通过限制具有定义电荷和自旋的系统的动态实现。
5. LC-DFT方法通过引入拉格朗日乘数修改能量功能，应用物理上合理的约束。这在科恩-沙姆方程的层次上实现了约束条件。
6. 文档强调了非绝热状态与已建立的迪亚贝蒂概念的区别，并更倾向于将这些状态称为非绝热状态，以突出这一区别。
7. LC-DFT方法是其他受约束DFT应用（如自旋密度泛函理论、斯莱特-简克过渡态和固定自旋瞬变（FSM）方法）的温和推广。它旨在在原子或原子团等特定子系统中保持电子数量，并考虑电子和磁化密度的空间分布。
8. 方法适用于一系列系统，包括表面和簇等扩展系统，以及原子-分子碰撞等非周期模型系统。
9. 文档提到了LC-DFT方法成功应用于解决表面科学中的长期问题，具体为氧分子在Al111表面的低粘附概率。它还通过原子-分子散射事件和簇相互作用的示例展示了方法的广泛适用性。
10. LC-DFT方法旨在通过控制电子数量并考虑使用的交换相关函数的近似来准确预测化学过程，从而克服描述化学反应的局限性。
11. 使用LC-DFT方法的计算成本通常与标准绝热计算相当，甚至更低，尤其是对于具有局部电子状态的系统。基于子系统中电荷或电子数量的收敛准则有时可以实现更高效的自我一致解。
12. LC-DFT方法提供了几个潜在优势，包括提高预测非绝热效应的准确性、更好地控制电子和磁化密度的空间分布以及提高计算计算的效率。
