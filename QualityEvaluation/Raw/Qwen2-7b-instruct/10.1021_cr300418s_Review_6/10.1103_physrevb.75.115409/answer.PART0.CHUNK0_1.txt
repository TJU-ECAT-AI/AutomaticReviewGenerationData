The aim of this work is to develop and apply a nonadiabatic approach, with a similar physical motivation as the diabaticity concept. We account for the tendency to maintain a given character of the electronic structure, e.g., due to selection rules, by focusing on the dynamics of a system with defined charge and spin in suitably chosen subsystems, typically the two reactants in a scattering event. Using again the example of an O2 molecule, this could, e.g., be a state with fixed triplet spin on the molecule, even when it interacts with another reactant. Instead of using the properties of the many-body wave function as the formal basis, we thus build our approach on a defined total spin or total charge, or other well-defined quantity in the local Hilbert space of a chosen subsystem, which can be an atom or a group of atoms. The thus defined nonadiabatic PESs are computed with density-functional theory DFT,9,10 and, in particular, using the idea of constrained DFT formulated by Dederichs et al. in 1984.11 The basic idea is to modify the energy functional employed in DFT by applying physically meaningful constraints. The constraint is enforced through an additional Lagrange multiplier, which on the level of the Kohn-Sham KS equations yields an additional term to the KS effective potential.

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by allowing us to simulate and study complex chemical reactions and material properties with high accuracy and efficiency. DFT provides a quantum mechanical framework for understanding electronic structures and dynamics, enabling the prediction of catalytic activities based on the electronic configurations of the catalysts and substrates. Cluster models, on the other hand, offer a simplified yet powerful approach to simulate the interactions between catalysts and reactants at the atomic scale, facilitating the exploration of new catalytic materials and understanding of their performance.

Key considerations for using these methods include selecting appropriate parameters for the simulations, such as the size and composition of clusters, the choice of basis sets and exchange-correlation functionals in DFT, and ensuring sufficient sampling of the configurational space. Challenges arise from the computational demands of performing extensive simulations, especially for systems with many atoms, and from the need to interpret and validate the results against experimental data. Potential benefits include the ability to rapidly screen large libraries of candidate materials, optimize catalyst design, and gain insights into the mechanisms driving catalytic processes, which can guide the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic technologies.

计算方法，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，通过允许我们使用高精度和效率来模拟和研究烷烃活化中掺杂氧化物催化剂的催化活性，从而增强了我们预测、分析和理解催化活性的能力。DFT提供了一种量子力学框架，用于理解电子结构和动力学，使我们能够根据催化剂和反应物的电子配置预测催化活性。另一方面，簇模型提供了一种简化但强大的方法，用于在原子尺度上模拟催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用，从而促进了新催化剂材料的探索和性能的理解。

使用这些方法的关键考虑因素包括为模拟选择合适的参数，例如簇的大小和组成，DFT中基组和交换关联功能的选择，以及确保对构象空间进行充分采样。面临的挑战包括进行大量计算的计算需求，尤其是对于包含许多原子的系统，并且需要将结果与实验数据进行解释和验证。潜在的好处包括能够快速筛选大型候选材料库，优化催化剂设计，并获得驱动催化过程机制的见解，这可以指导开发更高效和可持续的催化技术。
