Challenges in these approaches often relate to computational cost, especially for large systems, and the extrapolation of results from the models to real-world conditions. Potential benefits include the ability to screen large numbers of catalyst candidates efficiently, optimize existing catalysts, and gain insights into the mechanisms of catalytic reactions.
