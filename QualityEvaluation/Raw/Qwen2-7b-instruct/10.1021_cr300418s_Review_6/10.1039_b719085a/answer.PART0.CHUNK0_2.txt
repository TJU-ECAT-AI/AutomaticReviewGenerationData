[1] "Understanding the surface chemistry of TiO2 is key to the development and optimisation of many technologies, such as solar power, catalysis, gas sensing, medical implantation, and corrosion protection."
[2] "In order to address this, considerable research effort has been directed at model single crystal surfaces of TiO2."
[3] "In this critical review, we discuss the chemical reactivity of TiO2(110), focusing in detail on four molecules/classes of molecules. The selected molecules are water, oxygen, carboxylic acids, and alcoholsall of which have importance not only to industry but also in nature (173 references)."
[4] "For now, we will discuss only the two higher temperature peaks."
[5] "By imaging the reaction dynamically, STM has the power to directly follow the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs."
[6] "As the concentration of the bright spots at B290 K is about 
B0.08 ML, Brookes et al.62 infer that they represent OHb formed from water dissociated in Ob-vacs."
[7] "Evidence accumulated over the past few years, how- ever,28,6569 reverses the assignment of type-A defects by Schaub et al.64"
[8] "One of the keys to distinguishing OHb from Ob-vacs was suggested by studies in which the STM tip was scanned over the TiO2(110) surface at a raised voltage of +3 V."
[9] "Type-A defects were removed from the surface and interpreted as tip-induced refilling of Ob-vacs by Diebold et al.70 and as tip-induced removal of hydrogen from OHb by Suzuki et al.63"
[10] "The evidence for this assignment was two-fold. First, their DFT simulations of STM images suggest that Ob-vacs should be brighter than OHb."
[11] "In such a configuration, individual OHb from the pair are difficult to resolve in STM images and each OHb pair therefore appears as a single feature, explaining the apparent anomaly."
[12] "At 120 K, Henderson et al.96 reported that up to three O2 molecules were adsorbed per Ob-vac."
[13] "Because the additional molecularly adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in adjacent sites."
[14] "As these surfaces are heated, one O2 per Ob-vac dissociates."
[15] "The a state dominates at such a low temperature."
[16] "By annealing above B200 K converts the a state to the b state."
[17] "This was based on their maximum saturation density (0.12 ML) which compared well with typical estimates of the Ob-vac density."
[18] "It was therefore concluded that whilst the additional molecularly adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in adjacent sites."
[19] "The same cyclic growth can be seen on a much larger scale in the series of LEEM images shown in Fig. 19."
[20] "The intensity of the bright-field images oscillates during exposure."
[21] "The structure was assigned to an incomplete 11 layer which forms on top of the normal 11 termination. It was termed a rosette network and forms at B470660 K."
