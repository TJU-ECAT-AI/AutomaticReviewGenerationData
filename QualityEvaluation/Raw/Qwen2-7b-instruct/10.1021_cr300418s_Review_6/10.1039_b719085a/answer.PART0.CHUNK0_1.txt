[3] "To date, rutile TiO2(110) is the most studied single crystal TiO2 surface. Indeed, its 11 termination has emerged as the prototypical metal oxide surface for fundamental studies."
[4] "Understanding the surface chemistry of TiO2 is key to the development and optimisation of many technologies, such as solar power, catalysis, gas sensing, medical implantation, and corrosion protection."
[5] "In this critical review, we are not only concerned with the chemistry of TiO2(110), but also that of the reconstructed 12 phase(s)."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, play a pivotal role in predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These approaches enable the exploration of new catalytic materials by allowing researchers to simulate the behavior of catalysts under various conditions. Key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical predictions, which relies heavily on the choice of the functional in DFT calculations and the size of the cluster models. Efficiency is another critical aspect, as the computational cost can be substantial, especially for large systems. Potential benefits include the ability to screen a vast number of materials before experimental validation, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming trial-and-error experiments. Additionally, these computational methods can help identify the active sites and mechanisms of catalytic reactions, providing insights that are not easily accessible through experimental techniques alone.

在预测、分析和理解掺杂氧化物催化剂在烷烃活化中的催化活性方面，计算方法，尤其是密度泛函理论（DFT）和簇模型，起着至关重要的作用。这些方法使研究人员能够通过模拟催化剂在不同条件下的行为来探索新的催化材料。关键考虑因素包括理论预测的准确性，这在很大程度上取决于DFT计算中功能的选择以及簇模型的大小。效率是另一个关键方面，因为计算成本可能相当大，特别是对于大型系统而言。潜在的好处包括能够在实验验证之前筛选大量的材料，从而减少昂贵且耗时的试错实验的需求。此外，这些计算方法还可以帮助确定活性位点和反应机制，提供仅通过实验技术难以获得的见解。
