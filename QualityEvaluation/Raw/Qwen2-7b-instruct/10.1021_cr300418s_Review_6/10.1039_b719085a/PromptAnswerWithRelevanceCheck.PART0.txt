The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, play a pivotal role in predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These approaches enable the exploration of new catalytic materials by allowing researchers to simulate the behavior of catalysts under various conditions. Key considerations include the accuracy of the theoretical predictions, which relies heavily on the choice of the functional in DFT calculations and the size of the cluster models. Efficiency is another critical aspect, as the computational cost can be substantial, especially for large systems. Potential benefits include the ability to screen a vast number of materials before experimental validation, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming trial-and-error experiments. Additionally, these computational methods can help identify the active sites and mechanisms of catalytic reactions, providing insights that are not easily accessible through experimental techniques alone.

[1] "Understanding the surface chemistry of TiO2 is key to the development and optimisation of many technologies, such as solar power, catalysis, gas sensing, medical implantation, and corrosion protection."
[2] "In order to address this, considerable research effort has been directed at model single crystal surfaces of TiO2."
[3] "In this critical review, we discuss the chemical reactivity of TiO2(110), focusing in detail on four molecules/classes of molecules. The selected molecules are water, oxygen, carboxylic acids, and alcoholsall of which have importance not only to industry but also in nature (173 references)."
[4] "For now, we will discuss only the two higher temperature peaks."
[5] "By imaging the reaction dynamically, STM has the power to directly follow the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs."
[6] "As the concentration of the bright spots at B290 K is about 
B0.08 ML, Brookes et al.62 infer that they represent OHb formed from water dissociated in Ob-vacs."
[7] "Evidence accumulated over the past few years, how- ever,28,6569 reverses the assignment of type-A defects by Schaub et al.64"
[8] "One of the keys to distinguishing OHb from Ob-vacs was suggested by studies in which the STM tip was scanned over the TiO2(110) surface at a raised voltage of +3 V."
[9] "Type-A defects were removed from the surface and interpreted as tip-induced refilling of Ob-vacs by Diebold et al.70 and as tip-induced removal of hydrogen from OHb by Suzuki et al.63"
[10] "The evidence for this assignment was two-fold. First, their DFT simulations of STM images suggest that Ob-vacs should be brighter than OHb."
[11] "In such a configuration, individual OHb from the pair are difficult to resolve in STM images and each OHb pair therefore appears as a single feature, explaining the apparent anomaly."
[12] "At 120 K, Henderson et al.96 reported that up to three O2 molecules were adsorbed per Ob-vac."
[13] "Because the additional molecularly adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in adjacent sites."
[14] "As these surfaces are heated, one O2 per Ob-vac dissociates."
[15] "The a state dominates at such a low temperature."
[16] "By annealing above B200 K converts the a state to the b state."
[17] "This was based on their maximum saturation density (0.12 ML) which compared well with typical estimates of the Ob-vac density."
[18] "It was therefore concluded that whilst the additional molecularly adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in adjacent sites."
[19] "The same cyclic growth can be seen on a much larger scale in the series of LEEM images shown in Fig. 19."
[20] "The intensity of the bright-field images oscillates during exposure."
[21] "The structure was assigned to an incomplete 11 layer which forms on top of the normal 11 termination. It was termed a rosette network and forms at B470660 K."
