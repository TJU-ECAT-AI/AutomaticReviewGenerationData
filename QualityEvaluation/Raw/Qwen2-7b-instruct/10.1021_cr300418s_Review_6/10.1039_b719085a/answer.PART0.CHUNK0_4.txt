<p>Chemical reactions on rutile TiO2(110)w Chi Lun Pang,a Robert Lindsayb and Geoff Thorntona Received 11th August 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 4th September 2008</p>
<p>To date, rutile TiO2(110) is the most studied single crystal TiO2 surface. Indeed, its 11 termination has emerged as the prototypical metal oxide surface for fundamental studies. It serves as a playground for researchers exploring a wide variety of important topics, including surface chemistry at both regular terrace sites and defects.</p>
<p>In this critical review, we are not only concerned with the chemistry of TiO2(110), but also that of the reconstructed 12 phase(s). We concentrate on the reactivity of these surfaces with a number of technologically important molecules, namely H2O, O2, R(COOH)n, and R(OH)n, updating information provided in the seminal review of the surface science of TiO2 by Diebold.</p>
<p>Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies, such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material.</p>
<p>For TiO2(110), fortunately, many structural aspects are well characterised, in particular for the 11 phase. a London Centre for Nanotechnology and Department of Chemistry, University College London, London, UK WC1H 0AJ b Corrosion and Protection Centre, School of Materials, The University of Manchester, PO Box 88, Manchester, UK M60 1QD w Part of a thematic issue covering reactions at surfaces in honour of the 2007 Nobel Prize winner Professor Gerhard Ertl.</p>
