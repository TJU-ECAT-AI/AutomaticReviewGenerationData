<p>Indeed, the only published theoretical studies to date pertain to: (i) the soft landing of a Pdn (n = 27, 13) cluster on a MgO(100) surface, (ii) a joint theoretical and experimental (TPR and infrared spectroscopy) investigation of the catalyzed CO oxidation by a single Pd atom anchord at an oxygen vacancy on a MgO(100) surface, (iii) an investigation of the facile transformations of small magnesia supported Pd clusters to PdxOy nanooxides.</p>
<p>First-principles density-functional theory calculations used the spin-density functional theory (SDFT), (48) (49) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (50) for the exchange and correlation energy. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials (51) and a plane-wave basis with a cutoff energy of 300 eV were employed, with Γ-point sampling of the Brillouin zone.</p>
<p>Formation of the 13C16O16O isotopomer is associated with a mechanism involving oxygen atoms from the oxidized palladium clusters, and the other isotopomer, 13C16O18O, is taken to originate from the oxidation of CO by molecular oxygen (18O2) dosed at cryogenic (120 K) conditions subsequent to the aforementioned high-temperature pretreatment of the cluster.</p>
<p>The lowest reaction temperature for which oxidation of CO was detected in the experiments was 180 K (see Figure 1 where the α peak corresponds to the formation of the C16O18O isotopomer, resulting from a LH-type reaction between an adsorbed C16O and a molecularly (interfacially) adsorbed 18O2, and see the atomic configuration of Pd30O10(18O2)(CO)13/MgO in Figure 9(a)).</p>
<p>Several atomic configurations of the model catalyst system corresponding to selected CO oxidation reaction processes on the partially oxidized Pd30O10(CO)13/MgO model catalyst are displayed in Figure 9, with cyan and white arrows pointing to the CO molecule and oxygen atom that directly participate in the reaction.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the contribution of the palladium atomic oxygen (that is, the oxygen atoms of the oxidized palladium cluster) to the CO oxidation processes is notably higher than that of the molecularly adsorbed oxygen.</p>
<p>Our strategy is to explore the reaction pathways involving a minimal partially oxidized supported Pd30 cluster that would allow a consistent description of the main observed features of the CO oxidation reaction and its temperature dependence.</p>
