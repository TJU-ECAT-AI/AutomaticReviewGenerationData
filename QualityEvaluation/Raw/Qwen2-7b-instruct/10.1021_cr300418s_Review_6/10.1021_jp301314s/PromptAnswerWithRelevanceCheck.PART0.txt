[1] "Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we investigated first the adsorption geometry of the Pd30 cluster on the MgO(100) surface. A square-base pyramidal structure was found to be energy optimal, with an excess electronic charge of 1.25e, originating from the underlying magnesia support, found to be localized near the interfacial region of the cluster with the supporting surface."
[2] "Subsequently, we explored rather exhaustively structural and energetic properties of a variety of oxygen adsorption sites on the supported palladium cluster and effects due to multiple adsorbed O2 molecules."
[3] "We note here that the electronic activation of the first four or five adsorbed oxygen molecules depletes the aforementioned excess interfacial charge, with further adsorbed oxygen molecules activated to a much lesser degree. As a result, the molecules near the cluster/support interface dissociate readily, while further oxygen dissociation processes (occurring at larger distances from the cluster-to-surface interface) entail much larger dissociation barriers, resulting in self-limiting partial oxidation of the Pd30 cluster."
[4] "Indeed, for these systems the nature of the oxidic species formed upon exposure to oxygen is likely to be influenced by the interaction of the metal particle with the underlying support (24-26) (commonly metal-oxide) and by finite size effects."
[5] "For oxidation temperatures higher than 500 K, large amounts of oxygen can be stored in the model catalyst in the form of a thin Pd-oxide layer at the particlesupport interface. The stored oxygen can be reversibly accumulated and depleted, providing an oxygen reservoir for catalytic surface reactions."
[6] "In this context, it is pertinent to note that for the particular conditions of the experiments whose results we display in Figure 1 (i.e., pretreatment of the Pd30 clusters with O2 at 370 K followed by annealing at 450 K) higher oxidation levels of the magnesia-supported Pd30 cluster are unfavorable."
[7] "The lowest reaction temperature for which oxidation of CO was detected in the experiments was 180 K (see Figure 1 where the α peak corresponds to the formation of the C16O18O isotopomer, resulting from a LH-type reaction between an adsorbed C16O and a molecularly (interfacially) adsorbed 18O2, and see the atomic configuration of Pd30O10(O2)(CO)13/MgO in Figure 9(a))."

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation in several ways:

1. **Structural Insight**: DFT calculations provide a precise determination of the adsorption geometry of the catalyst on the oxide surface, revealing that a square-base pyramidal structure is energetically favorable. This geometry is crucial for understanding how reactants interact with the catalyst surface and how the surface chemistry influences reactivity.

2. **Electronic Structure Analysis**: DFT helps in understanding the electronic structure of the catalyst, including the localization of excess charges. This is important for predicting the reactivity of the catalyst, especially in terms of how it affects the adsorption and activation of reactants.

3. **Dissociation Energies and Activation Barriers**: The calculations offer insights into the energy required for the dissociation of adsorbed species, which is critical for understanding the reaction pathways and the efficiency of the catalytic process.

4. **Finite Size Effects**: Considering the size of the catalyst particles, computational methods can account for the influence of the particle-support interaction on the nature of the oxidic species formed, which can significantly affect the catalytic activity.

5. **Oxygen Storage Capacity**: DFT can predict the capacity of the catalyst to store oxygen in the form of a thin oxide layer at the particle-support interface, which can serve as an oxygen reservoir, enhancing the catalytic performance.

6. **Temperature Dependence**: By simulating the behavior of the catalyst under different temperatures, DFT calculations can elucidate how temperature influences the catalytic activity, including the onset of CO oxidation and the extent of oxidation.

7. **Reaction Mechanisms**: Detailed simulations of reaction pathways can correlate with experimental observations, such as the formation of specific isotopomers and the activation of CO molecules, providing a mechanistic understanding of the catalytic process.

8. **Exploration of New Materials**: Computational methods enable the exploration of new materials and catalyst designs, offering insights into their potential performance before physical synthesis, saving time and resources.

Computational methods, especially density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These methods allow for the precise calculation of properties such as adsorption energies, reaction barriers, and electronic structures, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanisms. Key considerations include the accuracy of the computational approach, the efficiency of the calculations, and the ability to explore a wide range of materials and conditions. Challenges exist in achieving high computational efficiency for large systems and in accurately modeling complex interactions. Potential benefits include the prediction of novel catalysts, the optimization of existing catalysts, and the elucidation of reaction pathways that might not be easily discernible through experimental methods alone. 

Specifically, the document highlights the following points:
1. The catalytic activity depends on the size, morphology, structure, and chemical nature of the catalyst surface, which can change upon exposure to oxygen.
2. Finite size effects and interactions with the underlying support influence the nature of oxidic species formed upon oxygen exposure.
3. The dissociation barriers for adsorbed molecules are significantly affected by the location of the adsorption sites, with small barriers for sites closer to the cluster interface.
4. Further adsorption of oxygen molecules after exhausting the excess charge on the cluster leads to higher dissociation barriers.
5. Low-temperature oxidation of CO starts at 180 K, as indicated by the α peak in the TPR spectrum, resulting from a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type reaction between adsorbed CO and interfacially adsorbed 18O2.
6. The square-base pyramidal structure of the Pd30 cluster on MgO(100) surface is energetically optimal, with an excess electronic charge localized near the cluster-support interface.

These computational methods provide a powerful tool for exploring the fundamental aspects of catalysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of the behavior of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation.

<p>To highlight, we note here that, indeed, the importance of intermediate surface oxide phases has been recognized rather recently. (20)</p>
<p>This work was followed by investigations of different oxygen species on palladium surfaces, (21) as well as their interactions with reactants such as CO.</p>
<p>In a systematic experimental study, (22) it was found that the type of palladium surface oxide may be the determining factor controlling the catalytic reaction pathway and that chemisorbed oxygen serves as a most reactive species with a chemisorbed O(ad) layer enabling the coadsorption of CO(ad).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the experiments noted above, (22) the stoichiometric PdO was found to be essentially nonreactive (compared to the reactivity of the nonstoichionetric oxygenated species), and it has been shown to reduce only at much harsher conditions, requiring 10 mbar of CO and temperatures around 520 K.</p>
<p>The situation becomes even more involved in the case of surface-supported transition metal catalyst particles.

<p>We remark that the CO combustion reaction scheme used in the interpretation of the above molecular beam experiments from 4 to 10 nm supported Pd particles, involving formation of certain surface oxide species on the partially oxidized Pd particle, which is subsequently reduced via direct reaction with adsorbed CO or through decomposition and subsequent migration to a reaction site where the oxygen atom combines with adsorbed CO to form CO2, is akin to an MvK-type mechanism (see discussion at the start of this section).</p>
