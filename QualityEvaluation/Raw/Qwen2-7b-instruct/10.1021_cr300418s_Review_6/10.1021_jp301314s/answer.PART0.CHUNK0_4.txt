<p>The activity, selectivity, and specificity of oxidation catalysts is often found not only to be governed by the size, morphology, and structure of the catalyst but also show a dependence on the chemical nature of the catalysts surface, which may differ in the presence of oxygen (depending on oxygen pressure and temperature) from its native (bare) state.</p>
<p>To highlight, we note here that, indeed, the importance of intermediate surface oxide phases has been recognized rather recently. (20)</p>
<p>This work was followed by investigations of different oxygen species on palladium surfaces, (21) as well as their interactions with reactants such as CO.</p>
<p>In a systematic experimental study, (22) it was found that the type of palladium surface oxide may be the determining factor controlling the catalytic reaction pathway and that chemisorbed oxygen serves as a most reactive species with a chemisorbed O(ad) layer enabling the coadsorption of CO(ad).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the experiments noted above, (22) the stoichiometric PdO was found to be essentially nonreactive (compared to the reactivity of the nonstoichionetric oxygenated species), and it has been shown to reduce only at much harsher conditions, requiring 10 mbar of CO and temperatures around 520 K.</p>
<p>The situation becomes even more involved in the case of surface-supported transition metal catalyst particles. Indeed, for these systems the nature of the oxidic species formed upon exposure to oxygen is likely to be influenced by the interaction of the metal particle with the underlying support (24-26) (commonly metal-oxide) and by finite size effects.</p>
<p>Oxidation processes of palladium particles supported on metal-oxide surfaces have been extensively studied for a model catalyst system with size distributions of the supported particles in the several nanometers range.</p>
<p>For oxidation temperatures higher than 500 K, large amounts of oxygen can be stored in the model catalyst in the form of a thin Pd-oxide layer at the particlesupport interface. The stored oxygen can be reversibly accumulated and depleted, providing an oxygen reservoir for catalytic surface reactions.</p>
<p>Finally, for temperatures of up to 450 K it has been found that oxygen chemisorbs dissociatively on the metallic Pd surface areas. The oxidation process of the supported Pd particle initiates at the particle support interface, and from there it proceeds to the facet areas of the supported particle that are further distanced from the underlying surface.</p>
<p>We remark that the CO combustion reaction scheme used in the interpretation of the above molecular beam experiments from 4 to 10 nm supported Pd particles, involving formation of certain surface oxide species on the partially oxidized Pd particle, which is subsequently reduced via direct reaction with adsorbed CO or through decomposition and subsequent migration to a reaction site where the oxygen atom combines with adsorbed CO to form CO2, is akin to an MvK-type mechanism (see discussion at the start of this section).</p>
<p>Indeed, the only published theoretical studies to date pertain to: (i) the soft landing of a Pdn (n = 27, 13) cluster on a MgO(100) surface, (40) (ii) a joint theoretical and experimental (TPR and infrared spectroscopy) investigation of the catalyzed CO oxidation by a single Pd atom anchord at an oxygen vacancy on a MgO(100) surface, (41) and (iii) an investigation of the facile transformations of small magnesia supported Pd clusters to PdxOy nanooxides.
