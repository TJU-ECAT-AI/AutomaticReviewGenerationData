[1] "Many recent articles have suggested that density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized-gradient approximation does not provide the correct electronic structure for the oxides of titanium."
[2] "As is well-known, in DFT, the difference between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band is smaller than the measured band gap."
[3] "Moreover, it is expected (1, 2) that when oxygen vacancies are formed in TiO2 the unpaired electrons left behind after removing an oxygen atom should be housed in orbitals that are localized on the Ti atoms and whose energy is in the band gap; GGA-DFT calculations (8-13) do not fulfill these expectations."
[4] "It is believed that the main reason for these difficulties is the electron self-interaction in DFT."
[5] "Methods that remove the self-interaction, such as exact-exchange or self-interaction corrected DFT, require too much computer power to be useful for computations on catalysis."
[6] "A possible, practical cure may be provided by the GGA+U theory."
[7] "This prevents the unwanted delocalization of the d- or f-electrons, by adding to the Hamiltonian a term that increases the total energy when two d- or f-electrons are located on the same cation."
[8] "Therefore, it is necessary to find a suitable U value for DFT+U calculation on catalysis reactions involving titanium oxide."
[9] "In principle, more data should be fitted, but the structure of TiO is not well established, the energy differences between rutile, anatase, and brookite are smaller than the expected accuracy of DFT, Ti halides are not solids, and the sulfides have an ill-defined structure."
[10] "Furthermore, reliable desorption energies for molecules on titanium oxides are not available because of the difficulty of preparing well-defined surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum (steps and oxygen vacancies are always present)."
[11] "We find that a U value between 2 and 3 eV, used with the PW91 or the PBE functional but not with LDA, satisfies all these criteria."
[12] "The hybrid functionals give remarkably accurate reaction energies and reasonable band gaps, as compared to GGA or GGA+U."

Computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. DFT is a powerful tool for studying the electronic structure and properties of materials, but it often struggles with accurately representing the electronic behavior of transition metals and their oxides due to issues like electron self-interaction. To address this, researchers have proposed the use of DFT+U methods, specifically with U values tailored for specific applications, such as catalysis. The U parameter is crucial as it helps to correct the self-interaction problem, preventing unwanted delocalization of electrons and improving the description of the electronic structure. For catalysis involving titanium oxides, choosing an appropriate U value ensures that the calculations reflect realistic reaction energies, especially those related to redox processes. Hybrid functionals, which incorporate some Hartree-Fock exchange to mitigate self-interaction effects, also offer improved accuracy in calculating reaction energies and band gaps compared to traditional DFT methods. These approaches enable researchers to explore new catalytic materials and mechanisms with greater reliability, despite the computational demands associated with them. Key considerations include the selection of U values based on reaction energy fitting, ensuring that the theoretical predictions align with experimental observations, and balancing accuracy with computational efficiency. Potential benefits include the ability to predict and optimize catalyst performance, guide the design of novel materials, and accelerate the development of efficient catalytic processes for alkane activation and other chemical transformations.
