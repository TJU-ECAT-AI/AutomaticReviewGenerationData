[1] "The alloys of 31 transition-metal impurities dissolved in a noble-metal matrix have attracted considerable attention of theoreticians and experimentalists."
[2] "Although several photoemission studies have been reported, we present the first direct measurement of the unoccupied impurity-induced density of states for AgMn and CuMn as well as high-resolution photoemission data for the occupied states."
[3] "We conclude that the validity of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is highly questionable and that the majority states are delocalized, whereas the minority states are localized as found in Heusler alloys."
[4] "The BIS difference spectra show a Lorentzian-like peak just above the Fermi level which we interpret as the minority-spin Mn d states."
[5] "The majority-spin Mn d state must therefore lie inside the Cu d band."

1. The alloys of 31 transition-metal impurities dissolved in a noble-metal matrix have drawn significant interest from both theorists and experimentalists due to their unique properties.
2. The authors conducted the first direct measurement of the unoccupied impurity-induced density of states for AgMn and CuMn, complemented by high-resolution photoemission data for the occupied states.
3. The study found that the validity of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is uncertain, and the majority states are delocalized, while the minority states are localized, akin to findings in Heusler alloys.
4. The BIS difference spectra revealed a Lorentzian-like peak above the Fermi level, indicating the presence of minority-spin Mn d states.
5. The majority-spin Mn d state was found to be situated within the Cu d band, suggesting its integration within the copper host material.

1. 31种过渡金属杂质溶解在贵重金属矩阵中的合金引起了理论家和实验家的极大关注，由于它们的独特性质。
2. 作者首次测量了AgMn和CuMn的未占据杂质诱导密度状态，并提供了Cu、Ag、CuMn和AgMn合金的高分辨率光电子能谱数据。
3. 研究发现Schrieffer-Wolff变换的有效性存疑，主要态是去局域化的，而少数态是局部化的，类似于Heusler合金的发现。
4. BIS差分谱显示了一个位于费米能级之上的洛伦兹线状峰，这被解释为少数态Mn d状态的存在。
5. 主要态Mn d状态被发现在Cu d带内，表明其在铜宿主材料中的整合。
