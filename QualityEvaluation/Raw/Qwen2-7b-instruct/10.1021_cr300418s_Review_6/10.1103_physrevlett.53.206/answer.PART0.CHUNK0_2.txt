<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The majority- and minority-spin states of the exchange-split virtual bound state of Mn impurities in Cu and Ag are studied with high-resolution photoemission and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy. The exchange splitting is found to be close to the atomic value. The majority-spin state is strongly hybridized with the host-metal d band resulting in its delocalization. The minority-spin states are localized but close to the Fermi level so that a description of the physical properties in terms of a spin Hamiltonian is not appropriate.

研究了Cu和Ag中Mn杂质的交换分裂虚拟结合态的多数-少数自旋状态，使用高分辨率光发射和布拉姆斯特拉赫谱学进行研究。发现交换分裂接近原子值。多数自旋状态与宿主金属d带强烈杂化导致其去局域化。少数自旋状态局部化但接近费米能级，因此用自旋哈密顿量描述物理性质不合适。

The polycrystalline AgMn samples (5% and 10%) were obtained from the melt and examined metallographically for the presence of secondary phases. The polycrystalline CuMn samples (1.5%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) were supplied by the University of Leiden group. The bremsstrahlung-isochromat spectroscopy (BIS) and ultraviolet-photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) equipment is described elsewhere and was operated at resolutions of 0.85 eV and 90 meV, respectively. The samples were treated with either Ar-ion etching or scraping, and surface composition was checked with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Auger-electron spectroscopy.

The BIS difference spectra show a Lorentzian-like peak just above the Fermi level which we interpret as the minority-spin Mn d states. These difference spectra were fitted with a single Lorentzian peak cut off at the Fermi level and convoluted with a 0.85-eV full width at half maximum Gaussian (solid line in Figs. 1 and 2).

布拉姆斯特拉赫谱学差异谱图在费米能级上方显示出类似洛伦兹曲线的峰值，我们将其解释为少数自旋Mn d状态。这些差异谱图被拟合为一个单个洛伦兹曲线，该曲线在费米能级处截断，并与0.85-eV半最大宽度的高斯函数（图1和2中的实线）卷积。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The majority-spin Mn d state must therefore lie inside the Cu d band. This is not surprising since we expect the majority-spin state in Cu and Ag hosts to be at approximately the same position, which, with use of the AgMn value, would put it in the center of the Cu d band.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
因此，多数自旋Mn d状态必须位于Cu d带内。这并不令人惊讶，因为我们预计Cu和Ag宿主中的多数自旋状态大约处于相同位置，利用AgMn值，它将位于Cu d带的中心。
