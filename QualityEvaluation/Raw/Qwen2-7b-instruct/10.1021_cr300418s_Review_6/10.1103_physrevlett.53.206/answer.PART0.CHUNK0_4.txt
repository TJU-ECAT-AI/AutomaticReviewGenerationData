[1] "During the past decades the alloys of 31 transition-metal impurities dissolved in a noble- metal matrix have attracted considerable attention of theoreticians and experimentalists."
[2] "Much work has been done on the Kondo' and spin-glass properties, the latest theoretical developments being the solution of the Kondo and Anderson5 Hamiltonians and the development of fast-converging perturbation theories."
[3] "Although several photoemission studies have been reported, ' ' we present the first direct measurement of the unoccupied impurity-induced density of states for AgMn and CuMn as well as high-resolution photoemission data for the occupied states."
[4] "We conclude that the validity of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is highly questionable and that the majority states are delocalized, whereas the minority states are localized as found in Heusler alloys."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These methods allow for the accurate simulation of chemical reactions, providing insights into the electronic structure and reactivity of catalysts. Key considerations include the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, as well as the exploration of new catalytic materials. Challenges involve the complexity of multi-component systems and the need for robust theoretical frameworks that can handle the intricacies of heterogeneous catalysis. Potential benefits include the identification of active sites, optimization of catalyst design, and the prediction of novel catalytic behaviors. The study highlights the importance of considering the specific host-metal matrix, as the position of the majority and minority spin states can influence the catalytic performance.
