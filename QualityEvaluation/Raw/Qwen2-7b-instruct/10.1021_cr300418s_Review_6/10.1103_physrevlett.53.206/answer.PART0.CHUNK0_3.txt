During the past decades the alloys of 31 transition-metal impurities dissolved in a noble-metal matrix have attracted considerable attention of theoreticians and experimentalists.
Although several photoemission studies have been reported, we present the first direct measurement of the unoccupied impurity-induced density of states for AgMn and CuMn as well as high-resolution photoemission data for the occupied states.
We conclude that the validity of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is highly questionable and that the majority states are delocalized, whereas the minority states are localized as found in Heusler alloys.
The structure in the pure-metal BIS spectra has been discussed elsewhere.
In the alloy spectra additional structures are observed, the intensity of which is proportional to the Mn concentration. We therefore interpret these structures as the Mn-impurity-induced difference in the spectral distribution.

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the electronic structure and bonding mechanisms involved. These methods allow for the accurate modeling of complex systems, enabling the exploration of new catalytic materials and understanding of their behavior under various conditions. Key considerations include the choice of basis set, the level of theory used, and the inclusion of correlation effects. Challenges involve the computational cost, especially for larger systems, and the need for reliable input parameters such as exchange-correlation functionals. Potential benefits include the ability to optimize catalysts for specific reactions, predict reaction pathways, and understand the role of dopants in altering the catalytic properties.
