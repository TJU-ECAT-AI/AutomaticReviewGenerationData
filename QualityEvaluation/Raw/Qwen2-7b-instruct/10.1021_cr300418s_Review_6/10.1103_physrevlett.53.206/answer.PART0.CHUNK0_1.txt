During the past decades the alloys of 31 transition-metal impurities dissolved in a noble- metal matrix have attracted considerable attention of theoreticians and experimentalists.
The majority- and minority-spin states of the exchange-split virtual bound state of Mn impurities in Cu and Ag are studied with high-resolution photoemission and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy.
Although several photoemission studies have been reported, we present the first direct measurement of the unoccupied impurity-induced density of states for AgMn and CuMn as well as high-resolution photoemission data for the occupied states.
The polycrystalline AgMn samples (5% and 10%) were obtained from the melt and examined microscopically for the presence of secondary phases.
The UPS spectra were corrected for the He I satellite of 23.09 eV and an intensity of 0.017 relative to the main line at 21.22 eV.
The BIS difference spectra show a Lorentzian-like peak just above the Fermi level which we interpret as the minority-spin Mn d states.
The minority-spin peak position and Lorentzian broadening are given in Table I.
The majority-spin Mn d state must therefore lie inside the Cu d band.
This is not surprising since we expect the majority-spin state in Cu and Ag hosts to be at approximately the same position, which, with use of the AgMn value, would put it in the center of the Cu d band.

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our understanding of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of transition-metal impurities in noble-metal matrices. These methods allow for precise calculations of the exchange splitting, density of states, and localization patterns of impurity states. By analyzing the minority and majority spin states, researchers can predict the behavior of the impurities in different hosts and environments. Key considerations involve the accuracy of the theoretical models used, the efficiency of computational resources required, and the exploration of new materials with unique properties. Challenges include the limitations of approximations in DFT calculations, such as the local density approximation, and the difficulty in modeling complex interactions in alloys. Potential benefits include the ability to screen and design new catalytic materials with enhanced activity and stability, which could lead to advancements in chemical synthesis and energy conversion technologies.

The use of density functional theory (DFT) enables the calculation of electronic properties of transition-metal impurities in noble metals with high precision. This method provides insights into the electronic structure of impurity states, including their spin splitting and localization patterns. By comparing experimental results with theoretical predictions, researchers can validate the models and refine computational approaches. Cluster models are employed to simulate the effects of local environment on the impurity states, offering a way to study the influence of alloy composition on the electronic properties. These computational tools facilitate the prediction of catalytic activity in doped oxide catalysts, allowing for the optimization of alkane activation processes. However, the accuracy of these predictions depends on the quality of input parameters and the appropriateness of the theoretical framework used.
