[1] "Because of the adverse effects of the cancer-therapeutic doxorubicin, specific targeting is desirable."
[2] "One specific compound is designed to be a protein-bound protease-activated prodrug, which accumulates in tumors due to enhanced permeability retention and then is cleaved by a protease-specific antigen to release active doxorubicin."
[3] "This prodrug is stable and has anti-proliferative effects in a PSA-specific prostate cancer cell line, making it a worthy candidate for further preclinical studies."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Prodrugs such as the peptide-conjugate prodrug of doxorubicin are designed to specifically target prostate cancer cells by utilizing the protein-specific antigen (PSA) present in abundance in prostate cancer. This approach aims to minimize the adverse effects of doxorubicin while ensuring the drug accumulates in tumors. The stability and anti-proliferative effects of such prodrugs in PSA-specific prostate cancer cell lines make them suitable candidates for further preclinical research.

[1] "Because of the adverse effects of the cancer-therapeutic doxorubicin, specific targeting is desirable."
[2] "Many compounds have an N-maleimide function for reaction with a specific cysteine in human serum albumin."
[3] "One specific compound is designed to be a protein-bound protease-activated prodrug, which accumulates in tumors due to enhanced permeability retention and then is cleaved by a protease-specific antigen to release active doxorubicin."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The prodrug of doxorubicin, designed by Elsadek et al., specifically targets prostate cancer cells by accumulating in tumors through enhanced permeability retention. It features an N-maleimide function that reacts with a specific cysteine in human serum albumin. Upon reaching the tumor site, the prodrug is cleaved by a protease-specific antigen, releasing active doxorubicin to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.

[1] "Heinrich et al. (DOI: 10.1021/ ml100044h) describe the discovery, structure-activity relationship analysis, and cocrystallization of novel allosteric inhibitors of the kinase activity of this enzyme."
[2] "Small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme suffer from cross-reactivity to the insulin receptor ATP-binding site because of the similarity to the kinase ATP-binding site."
[3] "Therefore, competitive inhibitors of kinase activity also potentially inhibit insulin receptor signaling."
[4] "Because the inhibitors described by the authors bind at an allosteric site, they do not impact insulin receptor signaling at physiological concentrations."
[5] "Therefore, these small molecules are useful as tools for dissecting activity and as starting points for therapeutics."
