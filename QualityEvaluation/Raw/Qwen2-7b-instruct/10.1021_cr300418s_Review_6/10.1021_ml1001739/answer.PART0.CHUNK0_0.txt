[1] "Because of the adverse effects of the cancer-therapeutic doxorubicin, specific targeting is desirable."
[2] "One specific compound is designed to be a protein-bound protease-activated prodrug, which accumulates in tumors due to enhanced permeability retention and then is cleaved by a protease-specific antigen to release active doxorubicin."
[3] "This prodrug is stable and has anti-proliferative effects in a PSA-specific prostate cancer cell line, making it a worthy candidate for further preclinical studies."

Prodrugs such as the peptide-conjugate prodrug of doxorubicin are designed to specifically target prostate cancer cells by utilizing the protein-specific antigen (PSA) present in abundance in prostate cancer. This approach aims to minimize the adverse effects of doxorubicin while ensuring the drug accumulates in tumors. The stability and anti-proliferative effects of such prodrugs in PSA-specific prostate cancer cell lines make them suitable candidates for further preclinical research.

针对前列腺癌细胞设计的如肽连接的多柔比星前药等前药，利用大量存在于前列腺癌中的蛋白质特异性抗原（PSA）进行特定靶向。这种方法旨在减少多柔比星的副作用，同时确保药物在肿瘤中积累。这类前药在PSA特异性前列腺癌细胞系中的稳定性和抗增殖作用使其成为进一步临床前研究的合适候选物。
