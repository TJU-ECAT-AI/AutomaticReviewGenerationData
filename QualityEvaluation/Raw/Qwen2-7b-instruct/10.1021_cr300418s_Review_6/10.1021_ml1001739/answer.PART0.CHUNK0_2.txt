[1] "Because of the adverse effects of the cancer-therapeutic doxorubicin, specific targeting is desirable."
[2] "Many compounds have an N-maleimide function for reaction with a specific cysteine in human serum albumin."
[3] "One specific compound is designed to be a protein-bound protease-activated prodrug, which accumulates in tumors due to enhanced permeability retention and then is cleaved by a protease-specific antigen to release active doxorubicin."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The prodrug of doxorubicin, designed by Elsadek et al., specifically targets prostate cancer cells by accumulating in tumors through enhanced permeability retention. It features an N-maleimide function that reacts with a specific cysteine in human serum albumin. Upon reaching the tumor site, the prodrug is cleaved by a protease-specific antigen, releasing active doxorubicin to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.

由Elsadek等人设计的阿霉素前药，特别针对前列腺癌细胞。它通过增强渗透性保留积累在肿瘤中。该前药具有一个N-马来酰亚胺功能，可以与人血清白蛋白中的特定半胱氨酸反应。到达肿瘤部位后，前药被特定抗原的蛋白酶裂解，释放出活性阿霉素来抑制癌细胞增殖。
