Metal supported oxide nanostructures: model systems for advanced catalysis. J. Schoiswohl, M. Socka, Q. Chenb, G. Thorntonb, G. Kressec, M. G. Ramseya, S. Surneva, and F. P. Netzera,*

In this paper, we will concentrate on the structural and electronic characterisation of metal supported oxide * To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: falko.netzer@uni-graz.at Topics in Catalysis Vol. 46, Nos. 12, September 2007 ( 2007) 137 DOI: 10.1007/s11244-007-0324-6 1022-5528/07/0900-0137/0  2007 Springer Science+ Business Media, LLC nanostructures as inverse catalyst model systems and on the related properties of the metal-oxide interface. Specifically, we will discuss the geometric structure of vanadium oxide decorated Rh(111) and Pd(111) surfaces as probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and present the local electronic structure of different oxide phases as measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).

The vanadium oxide phases discussed in this paper are two-dimensional structures that bear very little relation to vanadium oxides in the known bulk phases. They exhibit novel structural properties with particular vanadium-oxygen coordination spheres and may therefore be regarded as artificial oxide materials in low dimensions that are stabilised by a combination of electronic and elastic interactions at the oxide-metal interface.

The following topics will be addressed in this paper. After a brief mention of experimental and theoretical techniques and of methods of surface and catalyst preparation in section 2, the geometry and electronic structure of selected vanadium oxide-Rh(111) inverse catalyst surfaces will be presented in section 3.1. In section 3.2 the reduction of vanadium oxide phases on Pd(111) and Rh(111) surfaces will be discussed. In this section the mass transport problem of oxide migration across a catalyst surface will be addressed. In Section 3.3 the influence of the metal substrate on the structural properties of the oxide overlayer phases, that is the role of the metal-oxide interface, in determining the geometry of the vanadium oxide phases observed, will be examined. A brief summary in section 4 will conclude the paper.

The mass transport problem of oxide migration across a catalyst surface is addressed in this section. The reduction of vanadium oxide phases on Pd(111) and Rh(111) surfaces is discussed in this section, including the morphology changes of the catalyst surfaces and the associated mass transport problem.

The role of the metal-oxide interface in determining the structures of metal supported oxide nanolayers has been investigated. The interfacial chemistry together with lattice mismatch strain effects at the interface have been identified as important parameters.

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the structure-property relationships. The key considerations involve the accuracy of the theoretical predictions, the efficiency of the computational methods, and the exploration of new catalytic materials. DFT calculations enable the prediction of the electronic structure, bonding characteristics, and reactivity pathways of the catalysts. Cluster models offer a simplified representation of the complex interactions at the metal-oxide interface, facilitating the understanding of the catalytic mechanisms. The accuracy of these methods depends on the choice of the exchange-correlation functional and the inclusion of correlation effects. Efficiency is achieved through the optimization of computational algorithms and the use of high-performance computing resources. The exploration of new materials benefits from the ability to screen large libraries of potential catalysts and to test their performance under various conditions. Challenges include the limitations of the current theoretical frameworks, the computational cost of simulating large systems, and the need for experimental validation. The potential benefits include the acceleration of the discovery process, the reduction of experimental costs, and the enhancement of catalyst design.
