Metal supported oxide nanostructures: model systems for advanced catalysis. J. Schoiswohl, M. Socka, Q. Chenb, G. Thorntonb, G. Kressec, M. G. Ramseya, S. Surneva, and F. P. Netzera,*

In this paper, we will concentrate on the structural and electronic characterisation of metal supported oxide * To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: falko.netzer@uni-graz.at Topics in Catalysis Vol. 46, Nos. 12, September 2007 ( 2007) 137 DOI: 10.1007/s11244-007-0324-6 1022-5528/07/0900-0137/0  2007 Springer Science+ Business Media, LLC nanostructures as inverse catalyst model systems and on the related properties of the metal-oxide interface. Specifically, we will discuss the geometric structure of vanadium oxide decorated Rh(111) and Pd(111) surfaces as probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and present the local electronic structure of different oxide phases as measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).

The vanadium oxide phases discussed in this paper are two-dimensional structures that bear very little relation to vanadium oxides in the known bulk phases. They exhibit novel structural properties with particular vanadium-oxygen coordination spheres and may therefore be regarded as artificial oxide materials in low dimensions that are stabilised by a combination of electronic and elastic interactions at the oxide-metal interface.

The following topics will be addressed in this paper. After a brief mention of experimental and theoretical techniques and of methods of surface and catalyst preparation in section 2, the geometry and electronic structure of selected vanadium oxide-Rh(111) inverse catalyst surfaces will be presented in section 3.1. In section 3.2 the reduction of vanadium oxide phases on Pd(111) and Rh(111) surfaces will be discussed. In this section the mass transport problem of oxide migration across a catalyst surface will be addressed. In Section 3.3 the influence of the metal substrate on the structural properties of the oxide overlayer phases, that is the role of the metal-oxide interface, in determining the geometry of the vanadium oxide phases observed, will be examined. A brief summary in section 4 will conclude the paper.
