[1] "The role of the oxide phase of oxide-supported metal catalysts in the course of catalytic reactions has been associated with a number of different effects, amongst them are: providing a high-area support for the stabili- sation of the metal phase in the form of small particles; influencing the metal phase via electronic interactions; or providing special reaction sites at the metal-oxide phase boundary."
[2] "The origin of the SMSI effects has been the subject of much debate over a number of years, but consensus of opinion is now in favour of the so-called encapsulation model, where the metal particles are covered with a thin layer of oxide in a reduced oxidation state."
[3] "The inverse catalyst is a metal surface, preferably a single crystal surface, which is decorated by oxide nanostructures."
[4] "There is a fundamental interest to explore the local electronic structure of nanostructured materials and STS provides the possibility to study the electronic signature of ultrathin oxide layers and the metal-oxide interface."
[5] "The local electronic information on oxides is important for identifying and elucidating the role of defect sites on oxide surfaces,which are the active reaction centres in many oxide catalysts."
[6] "The mass transport problem of oxide migration across a catalyst surface will be addressed."
[7] "In this context a particularly interesting observation is the formation of planar vanadium oxide cluster units which self-assemble under particular kinetic conditions on the Rh(111) surface."
[8] "The interaction of the V6O12 cluster with the substrate also mediates the three-fold contrast symmetry observed in the STM image."
[9] "The good agreement between STS spectra and atom-projected DOS peaks for the V6O12 clusters is thus a particularly favourable case, caused by the strong mixing of V and O states."
[10] "The exact geometry of this so-called surface-V2O3 phase has been quantified in previous work by X-ray photoelectron diffraction and LEED I(V) analysis."
[11] "The (5 · 5) phase of figure 7(b), which has not been treated explicitely here, is also a mixed V5+ V3+ vanadium oxide."
[12] "The (5 · 5) structure corresponds to a VO2.09, the V6O12 to VO2, and the (5 · 33)-rect to a VO1.6 stoichiometry."
[13] "We thus propose that the mass transport on metal-oxide catalysts, which can lead to massive morphology changes during oxidation-reduction cycles, may be caused by the diffusion of oxide nanoclusters that form intermediary under the red-ox conditions."
[14] "In inverse catalysts with oxide islands displaying small form factors are more active in oxidation reactions, e.g. in promoting the oxidation of CO by coadsorbed oxygen, than oxide-metal surfaces with high form factors."
[15] "We notice that the (4 · 4) V-oxide on Pd(111) contains somewhat less oxygen than the 7 phase on Rh(111) (VO2.8 versus VO3, respectively), but closer inspection of the structures also reveals that the (4 · 4) phase has less metal-oxygen bonding at the interface."
[16] "The DFT models of these two V2O3 phases are compared directly in figure 10(c) and (d)."
[17] "The (9 · 9) structure contains smaller regions of local (2 · 2) symmetry (figure 3c), but these are con- nected in a complicated way via the larger 8-fold ring structures in order to release the interfacial strain."
[18] "Support for this conjecture has been obtained very recently by growth experiments of V-oxide on vic-inal Rh(111) surfaces, where the (9 · 9) structure has been found on wide Rh(111) terraces, but a (2 · 2) structure was observed on small terraces, where the step edges may provide the strain relief."
