[1] "Many encouraging ideas and methods have been proposed in recent years for approximately including the missing long-range vdW interactions in generalized gradient and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT) methods."
[2] "The efficiency of popular methods for vdW interactions hinges on two major approximations: (1) the neglect or only effective treatment of electrostatic screening and (2) the neglect of nonadditive many-body vdW energy contributions beyond the pairwise approximation."
[3] "The recently developed Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) vdW method [5] computes the vdW energy for atoms in molecules using the ground-state electron density and accurately includes hybridization effects for the polarizability."
[4] "Neglecting retardation effects, the two-body vdW energy originates from the electrostatic interaction of atomic dipolar fluctuations."
[5] "In this Letter, we propose to extend the original TS-vdW method for molecules and solids by self-consistently including long-range screening effects in the effective atomic polarizabilities."
[6] "It should be mentioned that in practical applications the treatment of effects beyond two-body has been limited mostly to the three-body Axilrod-Teller formula [7] (a procedure that might even give the wrong sign for the many-body vdW energy) [8,9]."
[7] "The adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT) is an exact expression for the total electron correlation energy."
[8] "Thus, it clearly contains the full many-body vdW energy, and the formulas proposed in this Letter can be derived with approximations from the ACFDT formula [11]."
[9] "We assume that the system (molecule or condensed matter) has a finite electronic (highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) gap and can be divided into effective atomic fragments, for example, by using the Hirshfeld electron-density partitioning scheme."

The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by addressing the limitations of existing methods. The key considerations involve the accurate treatment of long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions, which are crucial for understanding the structure, stability, and function of molecules and materials. The Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) vdW method provides a computationally efficient approach for calculating vdW energies by incorporating hybridization effects for polarizability. However, it neglects the effects of electrostatic screening beyond the range of exponentially decaying atomic densities. To overcome this limitation, the method is extended by self-consistently including long-range screening effects in the effective atomic polarizabilities. This enhancement is critical for improving the accuracy of conformational energies for biomolecules and the binding of molecular crystals. The adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT) offers a theoretical framework that contains the full many-body vdW energy, providing a basis for developing more accurate and efficient methods to address the challenges in predicting the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts. The use of DFT and cluster models allows for the exploration of new catalytic materials with improved accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to handle complex systems involving multiple-body interactions.
