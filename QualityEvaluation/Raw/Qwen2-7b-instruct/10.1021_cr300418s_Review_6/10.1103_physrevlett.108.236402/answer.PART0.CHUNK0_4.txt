The computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by incorporating missing long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions. These methods are efficient, allowing for a reduction in computational cost compared to traditional electronic structure calculations. By including vdW interactions, DFT and cluster models improve the accuracy of predicting catalytic behavior, enabling a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in alkane activation over doped oxide catalysts.
