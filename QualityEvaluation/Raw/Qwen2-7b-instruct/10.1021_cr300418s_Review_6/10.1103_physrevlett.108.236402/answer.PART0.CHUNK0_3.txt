This Letter proposes to extend the original TS-vdW method for molecules and solids by self-consistently including long-range screening effects in the effective atomic polarizabilities.
It should be mentioned that in practical applications the treatment of effects beyond two-body has been limited mostly to the three-body Axilrod-Teller formula.
The adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT) is an exact expression for the total electron correlation energy.
The effective frequency-dependent dipole polarizability of every atom is defined as pi! pnr 1  f!=!pnrg2 ;(1)

The development discussed in the literature aims to enhance the accuracy of describing frequency-dependent polarizability for molecules and solids. This is achieved by integrating the Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals (vdW) method with the self-consistent screening equation of classical electrodynamics. The method improves upon the original Tkatchenko-Scheffler vdW approach by incorporating long-range electrostatic screening effects in the effective atomic polarizabilities. Despite this enhancement, the method still neglects nonadditive many-body vdW energy contributions beyond the pairwise approximation. To address this limitation, the literature proposes a scheme based on the coupled fluctuating dipole model (CFDM) to account for many-body effects. The adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT) provides a foundation for deriving formulas that incorporate the full many-body vdW energy. The effective frequency-dependent dipole polarizability of every atom is defined through a specific mathematical expression involving static polarizability and characteristic excitation frequency.

文献中讨论的发展旨在提高描述分子和固体频率依赖性极化率的准确性。这通过将Tkatchenko-Scheffler范德瓦尔斯（vdW）方法与经典电磁动力学的自洽屏蔽方程相结合实现。该方法改进了原始的Tkatchenko-Scheffler vdW方法，通过在有效原子极化率中包含长程静电屏蔽效应。尽管如此，该方法仍然忽略了超出双体近似的非加性和许多体vdW能量贡献。为了解决这一限制，文献提出了基于耦合波动偶极模型（CFDM）的方案来处理许多体效应。adiabatic-连接波动消散定理（ACFDT）提供了推导包含完整许多体vdW能量的公式的基础。每个原子的有效频率依赖性偶极极化率通过涉及静态极化率和特征激发频率的特定数学表达式定义。
