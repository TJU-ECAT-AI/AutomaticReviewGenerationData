The assessment of the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE screened Coulomb hybrid density functional demonstrates its capability in calculating spin-orbit SO splittings and energy band gaps. This functional offers improvements over other density functional theory (DFT) methods, such as local spin density (LSDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), in predicting structural properties like lattice constants and bulk moduli. However, it faces challenges in accurately reproducing experimental energy band gaps. Alternative approaches, like the scissor operator, LSDA+U, and quasiparticle Greens-function-based methods, are more commonly used for this task. The HSE functional, which includes a portion of Hartree-Fock exchange, has proven successful in calculating various properties, including thermochemical characteristics of molecules and structural properties. It provides an alternative efficient approach for solid-state calculations. The HSE functional utilizes a screened Coulomb operator, with the short-range and long-range partition conducted through the splitting of the Coulomb operator using error and complementary error functions. Calculations were performed using periodic boundary conditions, expanding Bloch functions in terms of atomic Gaussian-type orbitals. Spin-orbit splittings and energy band gaps were obtained through Kohn-Sham band energy differences. Lattice parameters were optimized with the HSE functional for all systems considered in the study. Optimized lattice parameters were provided for group IB-VII compounds, including CuCl, CuBr, CuI, AgCl, AgBr, and AgI.

评估Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE屏蔽库仑混合密度泛函显示其在计算自旋轨道SO分裂和能带间隙的能力。此功能在预测结构性质，如晶格常数和体积模量方面比其他密度泛函理论（DFT）方法（如局部自旋密度（LSDA）和广义梯度逼近（GGA））提供了改进。然而，它面临准确重现实验能带间隙的挑战。替代方法，如剪切操作符、LSDA+U和准粒子格林函数法，更常用于此任务。包含部分哈特里-福克交换的HSE功能在分子的热化学性质和结构性质的计算中已经证明是成功的。它为固体状态计算提供了一种替代的高效方法。HSE功能使用屏蔽库仑算子，并通过将库仑算子分解为误差函数和互补误差函数来进行短程和远程划分。所有计算均采用周期边界条件进行，以原子高斯类型轨道展开布洛赫函数。自旋轨道分裂和能带间隙通过Kohn-Sham能带能量差获得。对于所有考虑的系统，均使用HSE功能优化了晶格参数。为组IB-VII化合物提供了优化的晶格参数，包括CuCl、CuBr、CuI、AgCl、AgBr和AgI。
