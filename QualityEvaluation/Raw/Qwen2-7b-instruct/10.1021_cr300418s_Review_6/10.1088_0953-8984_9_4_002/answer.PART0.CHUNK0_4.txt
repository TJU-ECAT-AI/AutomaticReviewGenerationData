<p>There are two ways to study the ground-state properties and excitation spectrum of a many-electron system. The first one is to choose some model with one or more adjustable parameters, to calculate with this model some measurable property, for example the spectrum, and to fit the result to the experimental data to determine the parameters of the model. The second one is to find eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian in a parameter-free approximation (the first-principles approach). Naturally, the first-principles approach is more appealing, since it has no adjustable parameters.</p>

Computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) enable scientists to adopt a first-principles approach, avoiding adjustable parameters. This enhances our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing precise calculations without relying on empirical adjustments. Key considerations involve ensuring the accuracy of the DFT calculations, optimizing computational efficiency, and exploring the vast space of potential new catalytic materials. Challenges include dealing with the complexity of multi-scale phenomena, accurately modeling interactions at the atomic level, and interpreting results in the context of real-world catalyst performance. Potential benefits include the ability to screen and predict catalytically active materials before synthesis, optimizing catalyst design, and enhancing the understanding of reaction mechanisms.
