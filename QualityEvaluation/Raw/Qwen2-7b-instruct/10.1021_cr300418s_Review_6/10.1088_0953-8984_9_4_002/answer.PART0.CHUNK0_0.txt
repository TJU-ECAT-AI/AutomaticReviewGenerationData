[1] "The LDA + U method was proved to be a very efficient and reliable tool in calculating the electronic structure of systems where the Coulomb interaction is strong enough to cause localization of the electrons."
[2] "In order to answer this question Sr-doped (tetragonal) La2CuO4 was investigated [44]."
[3] "The undoped system is quite well described by the LDA + U method and a 2 × 2 supercell (La8xSrxCu4O16) was used to investigate the (self-) localization effects."
[4] "The problem of the charge ordering cannot be treated using the standard LSDA. The reason for this is a spurious self-interaction which is present in the LSDA."

1. The LDA + U method is a powerful tool for calculating the electronic structure of systems with strong Coulomb interactions, enabling the localization of electrons. 
2. To study the effect of doping on the electronic structure, Sr-doped tetragonal La2CuO4 was analyzed using the LDA + U method.
3. The undoped La2CuO4 was effectively modeled using the LDA + U method, employing a 2 × 2 supercell (La8xSrxCu4O16) to explore self-localization phenomena.
4. The standard LSDA fails to handle charge ordering due to an intrinsic spurious self-interaction in its approach.

1. LDA + U方法是计算强库仑相互作用系统电子结构的有效工具，能够实现电子的局域化。
2. 为了研究掺杂对电子结构的影响，对四方相La2CuO4进行了Sr掺杂，并利用LDA + U方法进行分析。
3. 未掺杂的La2CuO4通过LDA + U方法得到了有效模拟，采用2 × 2超晶胞（La8xSrxCu4O16）来探索自局部化现象。
4. 标准LSDA无法处理电荷有序，因为其方法中存在一个内在的伪自我交互。
