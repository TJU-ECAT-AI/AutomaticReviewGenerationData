The following series of benchmark calculations on a three-dimensional system demonstrates the effectiveness of the screening techniques outlined earlier. Figure 1 shows the CPU time scaling behavior for hybrid DFT calculations using both PBE0 and HSE for three-dimensional silicon diamond structure!. The use of a 6-21G basis set reduced both the computational cost and the convergence problems of the PBE0 calculations.

Given the fast decay of the SR HF exchange interactions and the high screening efficiency, we can now efficiently apply HSE to a variety of three-dimensional solids.

In all the examined solids, the crystal structure is determined by a single lattice constant. Table II shows the optimal lattice constants found using the Murnaghan EOS. The accuracy of the predicted values correlates directly with the level of approximation in the functional. HSE gives the most accurate results, followed by the TPSS meta-GGA functional, the PBE GGA functional, and finally LDA.

The predictions of bulk moduli are somewhat more sensitive to the functional employed. LDA tends to overestimate bulk moduli due to the overbinding of individual bonds, resulting in a mean error of 11.8 GPa. The GGA and meta-GGA functionals reverse this trend, now underestimating the bulk moduli by 29.2 and 24.1 GPa, respectively!. The HSE hybrid functional exhibits a significantly smaller ME of 1.4 GPa.

When only the semiconducting and insulating systems are examined, certain parallels to the case of the lattice constants appear. Again, the PBE and TPSS errors remain similar to the errors of the full set of solids. However, the LDA error decreases significantly to 8.1 GPa. Most likely, this improvement is due to a cancellation of errors. As with the lattice constants, the MAE of HSE drops noticeably to 3.6 GPa.

For the gallium compounds, it was necessary to use a larger basis set for band gap calculations than for the structural properties. While the 6-31G* basis set proved sufficient for P, modified versions of 6-311G* were used for Ga and N see Table I!. A similar treatment is necessary for GaAs. In the present study, however, we excluded GaAs from the band gap calculations since the computational cost of optimizing the basis set becomes rather large.

The results shown in Table IV speak volumes. All pure DFT functionals severely underestimate the band gaps, resulting in MAEs of around 1.3 eV, while HSE produces excellent agreement with experiment 0.23 eV MAE!.

Traditional hybrid functionals such as PBE0 or B3LYP34 are difficult to converge for these systems and calculations with similarly tight convergence criteria cannot be achieved on commonly available computer hardware.

1. The HSE hybrid functional is an efficient screening technique that takes advantage of the fast spatial decay of the short-range Hartree-Fock exchange used in the HeydScuseriaErnzerhof HSE screened Coulomb hybrid density functional. It is based on the PBE0 exchange-correlation functional, with the exchange energy term split into short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) components, and the Hartree-Fock long-range component is neglected but compensated by the PBE long-range component.

2. Benchmark calculations on a three-dimensional silicon diamond structure demonstrate the effectiveness of the screening techniques outlined in the paper. Using a 6-21G basis set, the computational cost and convergence problems of PBE0 calculations are significantly reduced.

3. The HSE hybrid functional provides the most accurate results for lattice constants, followed by TPSS, PBE, and LDA, respectively. The accuracy of predicted values correlates directly with the level of approximation in the functional.

4. The HSE hybrid functional exhibits a significantly smaller mean error (ME) for bulk moduli compared to LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA functionals. The MAE of HSE drops notably to 3.6 GPa when examining only semiconducting and insulating systems.

5. The HSE functional produces excellent agreement with experimental results for band gaps, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.23 eV, significantly lower than all pure DFT functionals.

6. Convergence issues and computational demands make traditional hybrid functionals like PBE0 or B3LYP difficult to use for systems like gallium compounds, where larger basis sets are required for band gap calculations.

1. HSE混合功能是利用HeydScuseriaErnzerhof屏蔽库仑杂化密度泛函中短程哈特里-福克交换快速空间衰减的一种高效筛选技术。它基于PBE0交换相关函数，将交换能量项分为短程（SR）和长程（LR）成分，并且忽略了哈特里-福克长程部分，但通过补偿PBE长程部分来抵消这部分。

2. 对三维硅金刚石结构的基准计算表明所提出筛选技术的有效性。使用6-21G基集，PBE0计算的计算成本和收敛问题得到显著减少。

3. HSE混合功能为晶格常数提供了最准确的结果，其次是TPSS、PBE和LDA。预测值的准确性与功能的近似程度直接相关。

4. HSE混合功能的平均误差（ME）在表征体模量时明显小于LDA、GGA和元-GGA功能。当仅考虑半导体和绝缘体系统时，HSE的MAE下降到3.6 GPa。

5. 对镓化合物进行带隙计算时，需要使用更大的基集，而6-31G*基集足以满足纯DFT功能的结构性质计算。对于GaAs，由于优化基集的计算成本变得很大，因此从带隙计算中排除。

6. 对于像镓化合物这样的系统，传统混合功能如PBE0或B3LYP在需要严格收敛标准的情况下难以收敛，且通常无法在常用计算机硬件上实现。
