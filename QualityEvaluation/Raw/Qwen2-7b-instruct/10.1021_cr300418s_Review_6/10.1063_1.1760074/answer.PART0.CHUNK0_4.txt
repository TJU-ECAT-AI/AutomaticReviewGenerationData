[1] "The fact that HSE can be applied to metals is extremely useful for applications in molecular electronics and related fields."
[2] "Combined with our earlier assessment of HSE for molecules,10 the present results allow a promising application of the HSE screened Coulomb hybrid functional to both large molecules and solids."
[3] "The screened Coulomb hybrid functional HSE significantly improves upon GGA and meta-GGA results for structural parameters such as lattice constants and bulk moduli."
[4] "For nonmetallic systems, the error is generally reduced by 50% or more. In metals, HSE still improves upon pure DFT results, but the effect is less dramatic."
[5] "Band gap calculations of semiconductors, using HSE, produce errors over five times smaller than pure DFT results."

1. The HSE screened Coulomb hybrid functional is beneficial for applications in molecular electronics because it can be applied to metals, which are crucial components in such systems.
2. The combined assessments of HSE for molecules and solids suggest its potential for broad applications, including both large molecules and solids.
3. The HSE functional enhances the accuracy of density functional theory predictions, especially for structural parameters in solids, surpassing generalized gradient approximations (GGA) and meta-GGAs.
4. For non-metallic systems, the HSE functional reduces prediction errors by 50% or more compared to pure density functional theory (DFT) results, although the improvement in metal systems is less pronounced.
5. Calculating band gaps for semiconductors with HSE yields errors significantly lower than those obtained with pure DFT, highlighting its superiority in this context.
