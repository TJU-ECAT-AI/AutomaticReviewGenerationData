The HSE functional is based on the hybrid PBE exchange-correlation functional developed independently by Ernzerhof and Adamo. However, the exchange energy term is split into short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) components and the HF long range is neglected but compensated by the PBE long range.
The following series of benchmark calculations on a three-dimensional system demonstrates the effectiveness of the screening techniques outlined earlier. 
The screening techniques described earlier, do not rely on any truncation radius and provide much better control over the accuracy of a given calculation.
All calculations converged the SCF procedure to an accuracy of 10^-28. Only SR exchange integrals smaller than 10^-12 were neglected.

The HSE functional incorporates the PBE exchange-correlation functional, with the exchange energy divided into short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) components. The HF long range is omitted but compensated by the PBE long range. Benchmark calculations on a three-dimensional system showcase the effectiveness of the screening methods. The screening techniques do not require a truncation radius, offering enhanced accuracy control. All SCF procedures were conducted to an accuracy of 10^-28, with SR exchange integrals below 10^-12 being disregarded.

HSE功能基于Ernzerhof和Adamo各自独立开发的PBE交换相关功能。交换能分为短程（SR）和长程（LR）部分，HF长程被忽略但由PBE长程补偿。在三维系统上的系列基准计算展示了所描述筛选技术的有效性。这些筛选技术无需设置截断半径，提供更佳的准确度控制。所有SCF过程均达到10^-28的精度，SR交换积分小于10^-12被忽略不计。
