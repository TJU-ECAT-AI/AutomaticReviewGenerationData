[1] "In the past, the lowest BE peak in the occupied DOS has been ascribed to the high-spin d" ' state (e.g.T =e 1' e 1 t 7 in NiO) and the higher BE should to the low-spin state (in NiO E=eg 1 es 1 es $),and this is also the outcome of several many-body-model calculations. ' According to our calculations,this high-spin low-spin identification has to be reversed."

The lowest binding energy peak in the occupied density of states (DOS) for nickel oxide (NiO) was traditionally attributed to the high-spin d" ' state and the higher peak to the low-spin state. However, according to our calculations, this high-low spin assignment needs to be inverted.

[1] "In the case of metallic Ni, it is well established that the magnetism is well represented by the LSDA, which is an effective Stoner theory,with I=0.9 eV. In our MF approach,we would find a Stoner splitting U+J, being too large by a factor of 5 ( UD-4 eV)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

For metallic nickel (Ni), the magnetism is accurately described by the Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA), which is an effective Stoner theory with an exchange parameter I=0.9 eV. In our mean-field (MF) approach, we would find a Stoner splitting of U+J, which is overly large by a factor of 5 (UD-4 eV).
