1. We have developed a parameter-free theory based on constrained LDA and successful mean-field model theory to describe the electronic structure of Mott insulators effectively.

2. In the LSDA, the localization is not governed by U but by the Hund's rule exchange, represented by the Stoner parameter I.

3. The optimal mean-field solution in the localized limit involves occupying n specific orbitals per atom, leading to a ground-state energy proportional to U"/2.

4. In scenarios where rehybridization effects are negligible, we disregard these and proceed with calculations.

5. By defining a modified U', derived from the lowest-energy high-spin d configurations, we can further analyze the d bands.

6. Using the calculated U values, we find that titanium dioxide (TiO) and vanadium dioxide (VQ) exhibit significant gaps, qualifying them as large-gap insulators.

7. Our method can be instrumental in future research, particularly in understanding and describing itinerant magnets beyond the mean-field approximation.

1. 我们结合了一些常识性观点（约束LDA、成功模型理论等）形成了一个类似于LDA的参数自由理论，该理论能够对莫特绝缘体的电子结构进行合理的描述。

2. 在LSDA中，局部化不是由U控制的，而是由Hund规则交换决定的，即斯通纳参数I。

3. 在局部化的极限条件下，最优的平均场解决方案是通过在每个原子上占据n个特定轨道实现的，此时的地面态能量约为U"/2。

4. 在无显著重组化效应的情况下，我们忽略这些效应并继续进行计算。

5. 通过定义从最低能量高自旋d配置导出的修改后的U'，我们可以进一步分析d带。

6. 使用计算得到的U值，我们发现二氧化钛(TiO)和二氧化钒(VQ)具有显著的间隙，使它们成为大间隙绝缘体。

7. 在未来的研究中，我们的方法可以作为工具，特别是在理解并描述超越平均场近似的游离磁体时。
