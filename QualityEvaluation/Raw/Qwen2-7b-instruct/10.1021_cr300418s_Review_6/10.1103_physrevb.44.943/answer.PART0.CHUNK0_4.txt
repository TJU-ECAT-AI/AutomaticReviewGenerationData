[1] "In the past, the lowest BE peak in the occupied DOS has been ascribed to the high-spin d" ' state (e.g.T =e 1' e 1 t 7 in NiO) and the higher BE should to the low-spin state (in NiO E=eg 1 es 1 es $),and this is also the outcome of several many-body-model cal- culations."
[2] "According to our calculations,this high- spin low-spin identification has to be reversed."
[3] "The lowest peak in NiO is clearly of E character and of the same sort as the local singlet band in the cuprates."
[4] "This low-spin nature of the lowest ionization state of NiO is in agreement with experiment."

1. Traditionally, the lowest binding energy peak in the occupied density of states (DOS) was attributed to the high-spin d" ' state (e.g., T =e 1' e 1 t 7 in NiO), whereas the higher binding energy peak was associated with the low-spin state (in NiO, E=eg 1 es 1 es $). This attribution was also confirmed by several many-body-model calculations.

2. Our calculations necessitate a reversal of this high-spin low-spin identification.

3. The lowest peak in NiO appears to be of E character, akin to the local singlet band found in cuprates.

4. This low-spin nature of the lowest ionization state in NiO aligns with experimental observations.

1. 以往，占据的密度泛函（DOS）中的最低能态峰值被归因于NiO中高自旋的d" ' 状态（例如，T =e 1' e 1 t 7），而较高的能态峰值则与低自旋状态相关联（在NiO中，E=eg 1 es 1 es $）。这一结论也得到了多个多体模型计算的支持。

2. 根据我们的计算结果，需要反转这种高自旋低自旋的识别。

3. NiO中的最低峰值呈现出E特性，类似于铜酸盐中的局部单重态。

4. 这一NiO中最低激发态的低自旋性质与实验结果相吻合。
