[6] "Accordingly,we find that also TiO and VQ are relatively large gap insulators if we use these U's in our functional."

1. We have developed a parameter-free theory based on constrained LDA and successful mean-field model theory to describe the electronic structure of Mott insulators effectively.

2. In the LSDA, the localization is not governed by U but by the Hund's rule exchange, represented by the Stoner parameter I.

3. The optimal mean-field solution in the localized limit involves occupying n specific orbitals per atom, leading to a ground-state energy proportional to U"/2.

4. In scenarios where rehybridization effects are negligible, we disregard these and proceed with calculations.

5. By defining a modified U', derived from the lowest-energy high-spin d configurations, we can further analyze the d bands.

6. Using the calculated U values, we find that titanium dioxide (TiO) and vanadium dioxide (VQ) exhibit significant gaps, qualifying them as large-gap insulators.

7. Our method can be instrumental in future research, particularly in understanding and describing itinerant magnets beyond the mean-field approximation.

1. 我们结合了一些常识性观点（约束LDA、成功模型理论等）形成了一个类似于LDA的参数自由理论，该理论能够对莫特绝缘体的电子结构进行合理的描述。

2. 在LSDA中，局部化不是由U控制的，而是由Hund规则交换决定的，即斯通纳参数I。

3. 在局部化的极限条件下，最优的平均场解决方案是通过在每个原子上占据n个特定轨道实现的，此时的地面态能量约为U"/2。

4. 在无显著重组化效应的情况下，我们忽略这些效应并继续进行计算。

5. 通过定义从最低能量高自旋d配置导出的修改后的U'，我们可以进一步分析d带。

6. 使用计算得到的U值，我们发现二氧化钛(TiO)和二氧化钒(VQ)具有显著的间隙，使它们成为大间隙绝缘体。

For metallic nickel (Ni), the magnetism is accurately described by the Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA), which is an effective Stoner theory with an exchange parameter I=0.9 eV.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Traditionally, the lowest binding energy peak in the occupied density of states (DOS) was attributed to the high-spin d" ' state (e.g., T =e 1' e 1 t 7 in NiO), whereas the higher binding energy peak was associated with the low-spin state (in NiO, E=eg 1 es 1 es $). This attribution was also confirmed by several many-body-model calculations.

2. Our calculations necessitate a reversal of this high-spin low-spin identification.

3. The lowest peak in NiO appears to be of E character, akin to the local singlet band found in cuprates.

4. This low-spin nature of the lowest ionization state in NiO aligns with experimental observations.
