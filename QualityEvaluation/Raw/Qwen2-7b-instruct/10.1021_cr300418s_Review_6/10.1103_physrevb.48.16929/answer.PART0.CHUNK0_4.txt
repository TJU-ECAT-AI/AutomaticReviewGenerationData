[1] "The main problem in applying the local-density approximation (LDA) to the systems with localized electrons is that the exact density functional results in a dependence of the total energy on the number of electrons E(N) as a series of straight-line segments."
[2] "In the local-density approximation, the function E versus N and all its derivatives are continuous, whereas in the exact density functional, the potential jumps discontinuously as the number of electrons goes through an integer value."
[3] "The discontinuity in the one-electron potential is the reason for LDA failure in describing the band gap of Mott insulators such as transition metal and rare-earth compounds."
[4] "In Ref. 3, we suggested a way to overcome this deficiency of the LDA by adding an orbital-dependent correction to LDA potentials (the so-called LDA+ U method)."
[5] "The main idea of our LDA+ U method is the same as the Anderson impurity model: to separate electrons into two subsystems localized d or f electrons for which the Coulomb d-d interaction should be taken into account by a term Ugg&nn in a model Hamiltonian and delocalized s and p electrons which could be described by using an orbital-independent one-electron potential (LDA)."
[6] "The energy of unhybridized occupied d orbitals is now even lower than the 0 2p orbitals and in the result the top of the valence band of NiO has predominantly 0 2p character with a strong admixture of Ni 3d states."
[7] "The energy of unoccupied Ni 3d states is pushed up by the LDA+ U potential correction."
[8] "Although the method presented here can yield quite accurate results for magnetic moments and band gaps, we note that it is still a mean field method in which electron removal and addition states are represented by single Slater determinants."

1. The primary issue with applying the local-density approximation (LDA) to systems with localized electrons is the continuity of the total energy function E(N) in LDA, in contrast to the discontinuous jumps in the potential when transitioning through integer electron counts in the exact density functional. This leads to inaccuracies in describing band gaps of materials like transition metals and rare-earth compounds.
2. To address this deficiency, an orbital-dependent correction to the LDA potential was introduced, termed the LDA+ U method. This separates electrons into localized d or f orbitals and delocalized s and p orbitals.
3. In the LDA+ U method, the energy of unhybridized occupied d orbitals is adjusted to align more closely with experimental observations.
4. The LDA+ U method enhances the accuracy of magnetic moments and band gap predictions but remains a mean-field approach, representing electron states with single Slater determinants.
5. The LDA+ U method improves the description of NiO's valence band by lowering the energy of unhybridized d orbitals and raising the energy of unoccupied d states, leading to a predominance of 0 2p character at the valence band top.
6. The LDA+ U correction shifts the energy of unoccupied Ni 3d states upwards, aligning better with experimental data.
7. Despite its success in certain areas, the LDA+ U method is still a mean-field technique, limiting its ability to accurately describe phenomena such as spectral weight transfers characteristic of correlated systems.

1. 应用局部密度近似（LDA）到具有局域电子的系统中时的主要问题是，精确密度函数在电子数量为整数时会导致势能出现断续跳变。而在LDA中，总能量函数E(N)和所有导数都是连续的。这导致过渡金属和稀有地球化合物等莫特绝缘体的带隙描述不准确。
2. 为解决此缺陷，引入了LDA的轨道依赖修正方法，称为LDA+ U方法。该方法将电子分为局域化的d或f轨道和非局域化的s和p轨道。
3. 在LDA+ U方法中，调整了未杂化的占据d轨道的能量，使其更符合实验观察结果。
4. LDA+ U方法提高了磁矩和带隙预测的准确性，但仍然是一种均值场方法，用单个斯莱特决定性来表示电子状态。
5. 对NiO价带的描述通过降低未杂化d轨道的能量和提高未占据d状态的能量得到了改进，使得价带顶部主要呈现0 2p特性，并且混合了Ni 3d状态。
6. LDA+ U修正提高了未占据Ni 3d状态的能量，使其与实验数据更好地吻合。
7. 尽管在某些方面取得了成功，但LDA+ U方法仍然是一个均值场技术，限制了其准确描述如相关系统中谱权重转移等现象的能力。
