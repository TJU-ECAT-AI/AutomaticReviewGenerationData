1. The generalization of the local-density-approximation method is proposed for systems with strong Coulomb correlations, which aims to restore the discontinuity in the one-electron potential similar to the exact density functional.
2. The main problem in applying the local-density approximation (LDA) to systems with localized electrons is the absence of a potential jump, which is present in the exact density functional. This deficiency affects the description of the band gap of Mott insulators such as transition metal and rare-earth compounds.
3. Gunnarsson and Schonhammer demonstrated that the discontinuity in the one-electron potential contributes significantly to the band gap in these systems.
4. The core idea behind the LDA+ U method is to divide electrons into two subsystems: localized d or f electrons and delocalized s and p electrons. The Coulomb d-d interaction is accounted for in the localized subsystem, while the delocalized subsystem is described using an orbital-independent one-electron potential (LDA).

1. 对于强库仑关联系统，提出了局部密度近似方法的推广，该方法旨在恢复一电子势能的突变，与精确密度泛函一致。
2. 应用局部密度近似（LDA）到具有局部化电子系统的主问题是缺乏在电子数通过整数时势能跳跃的特性，这在Mott绝缘体如过渡金属和稀土化合物的带隙描述中是一个主要缺陷。
3. 格纳尔松和施诺赫曼证明了一电子势能的突变对这些系统的带隙贡献显著。
4. LDA+ U方法的核心思想是将电子分为两个子系统：局部化的d或f电子和非局部化的s和p电子。局部化子系统中的库仑d-d相互作用得到考虑，而非局部化子系统则使用单电子势能（LDA）进行描述。

1. The main problem in applying the local-density approximation (LDA) to systems with localized electrons is the absence of a discontinuity in the one-electron potential. In the exact density functional, the potential jumps discontinuously when the number of electrons goes through an integer value. However, all actual calculations in real systems are performed using the LDA, where the function E versus N and all its derivatives are continuous. This discrepancy is the reason for the LDA's failure in describing the band gap of Mott insulators such as transition metal and rare-earth compounds.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在应用局部密度近似（LDA）到具有局部电子的系统时的主要问题是单电子势能的连续性缺失。在精确密度功能理论中，当电子数通过整数值时，势能会发生断续跳跃。然而，在实际系统的所有计算中，都使用LDA进行，其中E关于N的所有函数及其导数都是连续的。这种差异是导致过渡金属和稀土化合物等Mott绝缘体的带隙描述失败的原因。

[1] "The main problem in applying the local-density approximation (LDA) to the systems with localized electrons is that the exact density functional results in a dependence of the total energy on the number of electrons E(N) as a series of straight-line segments."
[2] "In the local-density approximation, the function E versus N and all its derivatives are continuous, whereas in the exact density functional, the potential jumps discontinuously as the number of electrons goes through an integer value."
[3] "The discontinuity in the one-electron potential is the reason for LDA failure in describing the band gap of Mott insulators such as transition metal and rare-earth compounds."
[4] "In Ref. 3, we suggested a way to overcome this deficiency of the LDA by adding an orbital-dependent correction to LDA potentials (the so-called LDA+ U method)."
[5] "The main idea of our LDA+ U method is the same as the Anderson impurity model: to separate electrons into two subsystems localized d or f electrons for which the Coulomb d-d interaction should be taken into account by a term Ugg&nn in a model Hamiltonian and delocalized s and p electrons which could be described by using an orbital-independent one-electron potential (LDA)."
[6] "The energy of unhybridized occupied d orbitals is now even lower than the 0 2p orbitals and in the result the top of the valence band of NiO has predominantly 0 2p character with a strong admixture of Ni 3d states."
[7] "The energy of unoccupied Ni 3d states is pushed up by the LDA+ U potential correction."
[8] "Although the method presented here can yield quite accurate results for magnetic moments and band gaps, we note that it is still a mean field method in which electron removal and addition states are represented by single Slater determinants."

1. The primary issue with applying the local-density approximation (LDA) to systems with localized electrons is the continuity of the total energy function E(N) in LDA, in contrast to the discontinuous jumps in the potential when transitioning through integer electron counts in the exact density functional. This leads to inaccuracies in describing band gaps of materials like transition metals and rare-earth compounds.
2. To address this deficiency, an orbital-dependent correction to the LDA potential was introduced, termed the LDA+ U method. This separates electrons into localized d or f orbitals and delocalized s and p orbitals.
3. In the LDA+ U method, the energy of unhybridized occupied d orbitals is adjusted to align more closely with experimental observations.
4. The LDA+ U method enhances the accuracy of magnetic moments and band gap predictions but remains a mean-field approach, representing electron states with single Slater determinants.
5. The LDA+ U method improves the description of NiO's valence band by lowering the energy of unhybridized d orbitals and raising the energy of unoccupied d states, leading to a predominance of 0 2p character at the valence band top.
6. The LDA+ U correction shifts the energy of unoccupied Ni 3d states upwards, aligning better with experimental data.
7. Despite its success in certain areas, the LDA+ U method is still a mean-field technique, limiting its ability to accurately describe phenomena such as spectral weight transfers characteristic of correlated systems.

1. 应用局部密度近似（LDA）到具有局域电子的系统中时的主要问题是，精确密度函数在电子数量为整数时会导致势能出现断续跳变。而在LDA中，总能量函数E(N)和所有导数都是连续的。这导致过渡金属和稀有地球化合物等莫特绝缘体的带隙描述不准确。
2. 为解决此缺陷，引入了LDA的轨道依赖修正方法，称为LDA+ U方法。该方法将电子分为局域化的d或f轨道和非局域化的s和p轨道。
3. 在LDA+ U方法中，调整了未杂化的占据d轨道的能量，使其更符合实验观察结果。
4. LDA+ U方法提高了磁矩和带隙预测的准确性，但仍然是一种均值场方法，用单个斯莱特决定性来表示电子状态。
5. 对NiO价带的描述通过降低未杂化d轨道的能量和提高未占据d状态的能量得到了改进，使得价带顶部主要呈现0 2p特性，并且混合了Ni 3d状态。
6. LDA+ U修正提高了未占据Ni 3d状态的能量，使其与实验数据更好地吻合。
7. 尽管在某些方面取得了成功，但LDA+ U方法仍然是一个均值场技术，限制了其准确描述如相关系统中谱权重转移等现象的能力。
