1. The generalization of the local-density-approximation method is proposed for systems with strong Coulomb correlations, which aims to restore the discontinuity in the one-electron potential similar to the exact density functional.
2. The main problem in applying the local-density approximation (LDA) to systems with localized electrons is the absence of a potential jump, which is present in the exact density functional. This deficiency affects the description of the band gap of Mott insulators such as transition metal and rare-earth compounds.
3. Gunnarsson and Schonhammer demonstrated that the discontinuity in the one-electron potential contributes significantly to the band gap in these systems.
4. The core idea behind the LDA+ U method is to divide electrons into two subsystems: localized d or f electrons and delocalized s and p electrons. The Coulomb d-d interaction is accounted for in the localized subsystem, while the delocalized subsystem is described using an orbital-independent one-electron potential (LDA).

1. 对于强库仑关联系统，提出了局部密度近似方法的推广，该方法旨在恢复一电子势能的突变，与精确密度泛函一致。
2. 应用局部密度近似（LDA）到具有局部化电子系统的主问题是缺乏在电子数通过整数时势能跳跃的特性，这在Mott绝缘体如过渡金属和稀土化合物的带隙描述中是一个主要缺陷。
3. 格纳尔松和施诺赫曼证明了一电子势能的突变对这些系统的带隙贡献显著。
4. LDA+ U方法的核心思想是将电子分为两个子系统：局部化的d或f电子和非局部化的s和p电子。局部化子系统中的库仑d-d相互作用得到考虑，而非局部化子系统则使用单电子势能（LDA）进行描述。
