[1] "Introduction It has recently been shown that thermal reactions implicating more than one spin surface are common in different areas of transition metal chemistry, including oxo-transfer, CH activation, metal-catalysed polymerisation, and bioinorganic chem- istry."
[2] "This observation is relevant because the spin-forbidden CO additions to other 16-electron triplet complexes have been shown to be limited by a normal steric barrier while the crossing point resides on the down-slope leading to the product."
[3] "The presence of an energy barrier on going from 3FeL4H2 to the crossing point is in agreement with the slow observed rates for addition of H2 to these unsaturated organometallic fragments."
[4] "Among organometallic reaction intermediates, Fe(CO)4 has attracted considerable attention. Its ground state triplet is now solidly established both at the experimental 1422 and theoretical levels."
[5] "In this contribution, we intend to examine in more detail (i.e. including the explicit MECP computation) the reaction co- ordinate for the spin-forbidden H2 oxidative addition to the already investigated Fe(CO)4 and Fe(PH3)4 systems, and to extend the study to the mixed-ligand Fe(CO)2(PH3)2 system, to the less approximate Fe(dpe)2 model (dpe = PH2CH2CH2PH2) of the real Fe(dmpe)2 complex, as well as to the real complex itself."
[6] "The addition of H2 to the above mentioned 16-electron Fe(0) species ultimately affords dihydride products."
[7] "Products of H2 addition to the 16-electron Fe(0) complexes The energy gains associated to the oxidative addition processes are shown in Table 1 for all systems."
[8] "All 16-electron Fe(0) complexes were found to adopt a triplet ground state, the tripletsinglet gap being higher for the tetra- kis(phosphine) complexes, intermediate for the bis(phosphine)- dicarbonyl complex, and lowest for the tetracarbonyl com- plex."
[9] "The geometries are essentially identical in their gross features for all systems. Both the LaxFeLax and LeqFeLeq angles are wider for the singlet geometries relative to the corresponding triplets, whereas all bond distances are slightly shorter in the singlet structures."
[10] "The approach of the H2 molecule, a weak ligand, to spin triplet FeL4 is initially repulsive and necessitates significant molecular rearrangement before reaching the crossover region, leading to a significant energy barrier for the reaction."
[11] "The present computational investigation explores for the first time the details of the spin crossing region for the H2 oxidative addition to a spin triplet 16-electron fragment."
[12] "The energy for the MECPs is also of interest. As can be seen in Fig. 4, all of the MECPs lie higher in energy than the corresponding 3FeL4H2 dissociation asympote."
[13] "Clearly, the latter factor must explain why the Fe(dpe)2H2 MECP is later than the Fe(PH3)4H2 one, despite the larger energy splitting in the latter."
[14] "This is probably due to the fact that as noted previously (see e.g. ref. 6) the one- dimensional model for crossing is inadequate: all the geometric coordinates need to be the same at the MECP, whereas the geometries of the metallic fragment in its two spin states are not the same."

1. The introduction highlights that thermal reactions involving more than one spin surface are common in various areas of transition metal chemistry, such as oxo-transfer, CH activation, metal-catalysed polymerisation, and bioinorganic chemistry.
2. The spin-forbidden CO additions to other 16-electron triplet complexes often encounter a normal steric barrier, with the crossing point residing on the downward slope leading to the product.
3. The presence of an energy barrier when transitioning from 3FeL4H2 to the crossing point aligns with the slow observed rates for the addition of H2 to these unsaturated organometallic fragments.
4. Fe(CO)4 has garnered significant attention due to its established triplet ground state at both experimental and theoretical levels.
5. This study aims to delve deeper into the reaction coordinate for the spin-forbidden H2 oxidative addition to Fe(CO)4, Fe(PH3)4, and other systems, including the mixed-ligand Fe(CO)2(PH3)2, the less approximate Fe(dpe)2 model, and the real complex itself.
6. The addition of H2 to the 16-electron Fe(0) complexes typically results in dihydride products.
7. Table 1 presents the energy gains associated with the oxidative addition processes across all systems.
8. All 16-electron Fe(0) complexes exhibit a triplet ground state, with the triplet-singlet gap increasing for tetra-kis(phosphine) complexes, intermediate for bis(phosphine)-dicarbonyl complexes, and lowest for tetracarbonyl complexes.
9. The geometries for these systems display similar features, with LaxFeLax and LeqFeLeq angles being wider for singlet geometries relative to triplets, and bond distances being slightly shorter in singlet structures.
10. The initial repulsion between the H2 molecule and the spin triplet FeL4 necessitates significant molecular rearrangement before reaching the crossover region, leading to an energy barrier for the reaction.
11. This study is pioneering in exploring the spin crossing region for the H2 oxidative addition to a spin triplet 16-electron fragment computationally.
12. The MECPs' energy is notably higher than the corresponding 3FeL4H2 dissociation asymptote.
13. The Fe(dpe)2H2 MECP is later than the Fe(PH3)4H2 one, despite a larger energy splitting in the latter, likely due to inadequacies in a one-dimensional model for the crossing process.
14. The need for all geometric coordinates to be the same at the MECP contrasts with the varying geometries of the metallic fragment in its two spin states.

1. 近年来，涉及多个自旋表面的热反应在过渡金属化学的不同领域中被证明是常见的，包括氧化转移、CH激活、金属催化聚合以及生物无机化学。
2. 由于其他16电子三重态复合物的碳氧键添加通常受限于正常的立体位阻，而交叉点位于通向产物的斜坡上，这一观察结果具有相关性。

9. 这些系统的几何特征基本相似，LaxFeLax和LeqFeLeq角度对于单态几何结构较宽，所有键长在单态结构中较短。
10. H2分子与三重态FeL4之间的初始排斥需要显著的分子重组，以达到交叉区域，从而形成能量壁垒。

12. MECPs的能量高于对应的3FeL4H2解离斜率。
13. 尽管后者的能量分裂较大，Fe(dpe)2H2 MECP仍晚于Fe(PH3)4H2，这可能归因于一维交叉模型的不足：所有几何坐标需要在同一MECP处相同，而金属片段在两种自旋状态下的几何形状不同。
14. 需要所有几何坐标在MECP处相同的情况与金属片段在两种自旋状态下的不同几何形状形成对比。
