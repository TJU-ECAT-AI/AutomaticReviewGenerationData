[1] "In this contribution, we intend to examine in more detail (i.e. including the explicit MECP computation) the reaction coordinate for the spin-forbidden H2 oxidative addition to the already investigated Fe(CO)4 and Fe(PH3)4 systems, and to extend the study to the mixed-ligand Fe(CO)2(PH3)2 system, to the less approximate Fe(dpe)2 model (dpe = PH2CH2CH2PH2) of the real Fe(dmpe)2 complex, as well as to the real complex itself."
[2] "All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 98 program code,53 together with a modified form of the B3PW91 functional, and flexible polarized basis sets."
[3] "The approach of the H2 molecule, a weak ligand, to spin triplet FeL4 is initially repulsive and necessitates significant molecular rearrangement before reaching the crossover region, leading to a significant energy barrier for the reaction."
[4] "The present computational investigation explores for the first time the details of the spin crossing region for the H2 oxidative addition to a spin triplet 16-electron fragment."

This study uses computational methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, to explore the details of the spin-forbidden H2 oxidative addition to a 16-electron spin triplet fragment. The approach involves significant molecular rearrangement, creating an energy barrier. The calculations were performed using Gaussian 98 software with a modified B3PW91 functional and flexible polarized basis sets. This allows for the examination of the reaction coordinate and the understanding of the catalytic activity in alkane activation.
