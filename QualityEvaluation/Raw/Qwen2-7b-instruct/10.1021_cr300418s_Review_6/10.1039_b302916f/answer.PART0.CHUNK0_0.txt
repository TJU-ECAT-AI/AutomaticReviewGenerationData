[1] "The ability to locate and characterise MECPs between potential energy surfaces of different spin for realistic transition-metal containing systems, first demonstrated in ref. 6, is key to understanding spin-forbidden reactions."
[2] "This observation is relevant because the spin-forbidden CO additions to other 16-electron triplet complexes have been shown to be limited by a normal steric barrier while the crossing point resides on the down-slope leading to the product."
[3] "In contrast, the MECP energies described here are significantly different from system to system, and the rate coefficient varies exponentially with MECP energy."
[4] "The approach of the H2 molecule, a weak ligand, to spin triplet FeL4 is initially repulsive and necessitates significant molecular rearrangement before reaching the crossover region, leading to a significant energy barrier for the reaction."

1. The ability to identify and characterize minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) between potential energy surfaces of different spin states in transition metal systems allows for a deeper understanding of spin-forbidden reactions.
2. The spin-forbidden CO addition to other 16-electron triplet complexes typically encounters a normal steric barrier, with the MECP residing on the downhill path towards the product.
3. The energy of the MECPs in various systems is notably distinct, leading to exponential variations in reaction rates.
4. The approach of hydrogen molecules to spin triplet FeL4 initially presents a repulsive force, requiring substantial molecular rearrangement and creating a significant energy barrier for the reaction.

1. 确定并表征不同自旋状态间潜在能量表面的最小能量交叉点（MECP）的能力对于理解禁旋反应至关重要。
2. 其他16电子三重态复合物中的禁旋CO添加通常受限于正常的立体位阻，而MECP位于通往产物的下坡路径上。
3. 各系统中MECP的能量差异明显，导致反应速率呈现指数变化。
4. 氢分子向FeL4三重态铁的接近最初表现为排斥力，需要大量分子重组，并形成显著的能量壁垒以进行反应。
