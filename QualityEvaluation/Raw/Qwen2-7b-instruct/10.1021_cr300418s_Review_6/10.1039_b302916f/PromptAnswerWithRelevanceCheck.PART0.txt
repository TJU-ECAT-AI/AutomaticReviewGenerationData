[1] "The ability to locate and characterise MECPs between potential energy surfaces of different spin for realistic transition-metal containing systems, first demonstrated in ref. 6, is key to understanding spin-forbidden reactions."
[2] "This observation is relevant because the spin-forbidden CO additions to other 16-electron triplet complexes have been shown to be limited by a normal steric barrier while the crossing point resides on the down-slope leading to the product."
[3] "In contrast, the MECP energies described here are significantly different from system to system, and the rate coefficient varies exponentially with MECP energy."
[4] "The approach of the H2 molecule, a weak ligand, to spin triplet FeL4 is initially repulsive and necessitates significant molecular rearrangement before reaching the crossover region, leading to a significant energy barrier for the reaction."

[1] "Introduction It has recently been shown that thermal reactions implicating more than one spin surface are common in different areas of transition metal chemistry, including oxo-transfer, CH activation, metal-catalysed polymerisation, and bioinorganic chem- istry."
[2] "This observation is relevant because the spin-forbidden CO additions to other 16-electron triplet complexes have been shown to be limited by a normal steric barrier while the crossing point resides on the down-slope leading to the product."
[3] "The presence of an energy barrier on going from 3FeL4H2 to the crossing point is in agreement with the slow observed rates for addition of H2 to these unsaturated organometallic fragments."
[4] "Among organometallic reaction intermediates, Fe(CO)4 has attracted considerable attention. Its ground state triplet is now solidly established both at the experimental 1422 and theoretical levels."
[5] "In this contribution, we intend to examine in more detail (i.e. including the explicit MECP computation) the reaction co- ordinate for the spin-forbidden H2 oxidative addition to the already investigated Fe(CO)4 and Fe(PH3)4 systems, and to extend the study to the mixed-ligand Fe(CO)2(PH3)2 system, to the less approximate Fe(dpe)2 model (dpe = PH2CH2CH2PH2) of the real Fe(dmpe)2 complex, as well as to the real complex itself."
[6] "The addition of H2 to the above mentioned 16-electron Fe(0) species ultimately affords dihydride products."
[7] "Products of H2 addition to the 16-electron Fe(0) complexes The energy gains associated to the oxidative addition processes are shown in Table 1 for all systems."
[8] "All 16-electron Fe(0) complexes were found to adopt a triplet ground state, the tripletsinglet gap being higher for the tetra- kis(phosphine) complexes, intermediate for the bis(phosphine)- dicarbonyl complex, and lowest for the tetracarbonyl com- plex."
[9] "The geometries are essentially identical in their gross features for all systems. Both the LaxFeLax and LeqFeLeq angles are wider for the singlet geometries relative to the corresponding triplets, whereas all bond distances are slightly shorter in the singlet structures."
[10] "The approach of the H2 molecule, a weak ligand, to spin triplet FeL4 is initially repulsive and necessitates significant molecular rearrangement before reaching the crossover region, leading to a significant energy barrier for the reaction."
[11] "The present computational investigation explores for the first time the details of the spin crossing region for the H2 oxidative addition to a spin triplet 16-electron fragment."
[12] "The energy for the MECPs is also of interest. As can be seen in Fig. 4, all of the MECPs lie higher in energy than the corresponding 3FeL4H2 dissociation asympote."
[13] "Clearly, the latter factor must explain why the Fe(dpe)2H2 MECP is later than the Fe(PH3)4H2 one, despite the larger energy splitting in the latter."
[14] "This is probably due to the fact that as noted previously (see e.g. ref. 6) the one- dimensional model for crossing is inadequate: all the geometric coordinates need to be the same at the MECP, whereas the geometries of the metallic fragment in its two spin states are not the same."

9. 这些系统的几何特征基本相似，LaxFeLax和LeqFeLeq角度对于单态几何结构较宽，所有键长在单态结构中较短。
10. H2分子与三重态FeL4之间的初始排斥需要显著的分子重组，以达到交叉区域，从而形成能量壁垒。
11. 本研究首次通过计算方法探索了三重态16电子碎片上H2氧化添加的自旋交叉区域。

1. Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation by providing insights into the complex interplay of electronic and steric factors involved in the reactivity of transition metal complexes. They allow for the accurate calculation of properties such as bond energies, spin states, and potential energy surfaces, which are crucial for understanding the mechanisms of catalytic reactions.

2. The key considerations in using computational methods include the choice of the most appropriate theoretical framework, such as DFT, and the selection of appropriate basis sets and functionals to ensure accurate predictions. Efficiency is also a major concern, as the computational cost of these methods can be high, especially for complex systems. 

3. Challenges include the difficulty in achieving high accuracy in predicting certain properties, such as transition state energies, and the limitations of one-dimensional models in describing the complex geometrical and electronic changes that occur during reactions. Additionally, computational methods might not always capture the full complexity of real-world catalytic systems, including solvent effects and kinetic aspects.

4. Potential benefits of these approaches include the ability to screen and design new catalytic materials with desired properties, the prediction of reaction pathways and mechanisms, and the optimization of existing catalysts. These methods also facilitate the understanding of fundamental chemical principles underlying catalysis, which can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

5. The ability to accurately locate and characterize minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) between potential energy surfaces of different spin states is crucial for understanding spin-forbidden reactions. This provides insights into the role of spin dynamics in chemical reactivity and helps in predicting reaction rates and product distributions.

6. The computational investigation of the spin-forbidden H2 oxidative addition to various Fe(0) complexes demonstrates the application of computational methods in exploring the details of the spin crossing region for these reactions. The use of DFT and cluster models allows for the detailed examination of the reactivity of these complexes, including the identification of intermediates, product geometries, and the energy barriers associated with spin crossover.

7. The results highlight the importance of considering the σ-donating power of ligands in determining the stability and energetics of oxidative addition products. The comparison of different Fe(0) complexes reveals trends in the energetics of the addition process, influenced by the nature of the ligands and the spin state of the precursor complexes.

8. The MECPs between triplet and singlet surfaces in the reactant regions of potential energy surfaces are critical points that govern the reactivity of these systems. Understanding these points helps in elucidating the mechanisms of spin-forbidden reactions and in predicting the rates of such processes.

9. The analogy drawn between the oxidative addition of H2 to spin triplet complexes and other reactions involving weaker ligands highlights the role of spin crossover in affecting reaction pathways and rates. This insight can be used to optimize the design of catalysts for specific applications.

10. The computational study reveals that the approach of the H2 molecule to a spin triplet FeL4 complex involves a significant energy barrier due to the need for molecular rearrangement and spin crossover. This barrier explains the slow observed rates of H2 oxidative addition to unsaturated organometallic fragments, aligning well with experimental observations.
