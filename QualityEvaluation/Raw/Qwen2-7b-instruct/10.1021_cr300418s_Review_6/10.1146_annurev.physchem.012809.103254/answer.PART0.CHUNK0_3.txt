[1] "The invention of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and its offspring, atomic force microscopy, has especially broadened the reach of the field."
[2] "Real-space images with atomic resolution are now routinely achieved with commercial instruments and, in combination with area-averaging spec- troscopic techniques, allow one to obtain a truly atomic-scale picture of clean surfaces, and their modification with adsorbed entities."
[3] "In lockstep with these experimental advances, computational approaches have been developed, in particular first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT)."
[4] "New functionals (24) have improved the accuracy of theoretical predictions, and in combination with the expansion of computing power and efficient, user-friendly codes (5), sufficiently large systems can now be modeled so that theory has become invaluable in interpreting experimental data and often guides experiments."
[5] "Understanding the surface properties of oxides—their geometric and electronic structure, their reaction with adsorbed entities such as molecules or nanoparticles, and the formation of interfaces—is of key interest in many technological areas."
[6] "For example, water dissociates at the vacancies, resulting in two hydroxyls (3742) as shown schematically in Figure 3a."
[7] "Defects modify the electronic structure of TiO2. This can clearly be observed with spectroscopic techniques, for example, in the photoemission spectrum in Figure 3c."

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. Key considerations and challenges include accurately modeling the electronic structure of the oxide, understanding the interactions between the catalyst and alkane molecules, and predicting the stability and reactivity of the surface under various conditions. The benefits of these approaches include increased accuracy in predicting catalytic behavior, efficiency in exploring a wide range of materials and conditions, and the potential to discover new catalysts with enhanced performance. However, challenges remain in accounting for complex electronic correlations in metal oxides, accurately representing the surface dynamics, and achieving computationally efficient yet precise simulations.
