[1] "During the past 15 years or so, there has been a shift in the type of systems that surface scientists have investigated: Whereas the initial focus was predominantly on metals and semiconductors, there is a growing body of work that deals with metal-oxide surfaces, the topic of this review."
[2] "Understanding the surface properties of oxides—their geometric and electronic structure, their reaction with adsorbed entities such as molecules or nanoparticles, and the formation of interfaces—is of key interest in many technological areas."
[3] "Most metal oxides are predominantly ionic in their structural features (12). The bulk lattice consists of (formally) doubly ionized O2− anions, surrounded by metal cations."
[4] "Tasker (13) first discussed the surface stability of ionic crystals in a seminal article. A more refined and complete review was provided by Noguera (14) and was recently updated by Goniakowski et al. (15)."
[5] "For example, the cation-anion pairs at the many step edges on the ZnO(0001)-Zn side provide active sites for the dissociation of Brnsted acids (25, 26), and a fully hydroxylated (1×1) ZnO(000 1)-OH surface is quite different from an H-free (reconstructed) one."
[6] "On vacuum-prepared TiO2(110) surfaces, a few percent of the bridging O2c atoms are typically missing. The resulting vacancies appear as the (fainter) bright spots on the dark rows in STM."
[7] "That Ti interstitials diffuse much more readily than O vacancies has long been recognized as an important feature of TiO2 surface chemistry."
[8] "Vapor deposition of a metal on an appropriate (mostly metallic, and often refractory) single-crystalline substrate and by oxidation of the resulting overlayer either during or after deposition. Ideally, this produces an epitaxial film that has a known, reproducible structure and that is thin enough to avoid charging problems in STM and surface spectroscopies."

1. Over the last 15 years, the focus of surface scientists has shifted from primarily studying metals and semiconductors to increasingly exploring metal-oxide surfaces, which is the main subject of this review. Understanding the surface properties of oxides, including their structure, interactions with adsorbates, and interface formation, is crucial for numerous technological advancements.

2. The growing interest in metal-oxide surfaces stems from their versatile properties and technological significance. These materials encompass a wide range of physical and chemical characteristics, such as superconductivity, insulating behavior, corrosion resistance, catalytic activity, magnetic, optical, and electronic properties, making them integral to established and emerging technologies.

3. The structure of metal oxides is fundamentally ionic, with oxygen ions forming hexagonally close-packed layers and metal ions occupying octahedral or tetrahedral interstices.

4. The stability of ionic crystal surfaces was initially discussed by Tasker (13) and later elaborated upon by Noguera (14) and Goniakowski et al. (15). This concept helps explain the behavior of oxide surfaces based on their polarity.

5. The presence of step edges on the ZnO(0001)-Zn surface provides active sites for the dissociation of Brnsted acids. Moreover, the fully hydroxylated (1×1) ZnO(000 1)-OH surface differs significantly from an H-free, reconstructed surface.

6. On TiO2(110) surfaces, missing bridging oxygen atoms lead to the formation of vacancies that appear as faint bright spots in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images.

7. The ease with which Ti interstitials diffuse compared to oxygen vacancies has been recognized as a critical feature in TiO2 surface chemistry.

8. Ultrathin metal oxide films can be created through vapor deposition of a metal on a substrate followed by oxidation, ideally producing an epitaxial film suitable for STM and surface spectroscopy analysis.

1. 在过去的15年间，表面科学家的研究重点从主要研究金属和半导体转向了越来越多地探索氧化物表面，这是本综述的主要议题。理解氧化物表面的性质，包括它们的结构、与吸附体的相互作用以及界面形成，在许多技术领域至关重要。

2. 氧化物表面受到关注的原因在于它们的多样性和技术重要性。这些材料具有广泛且多样的物理和化学特性，如超导性、绝缘行为、防腐蚀能力、催化活性、磁性、光学和电子性质，使其成为现有技术和新兴技术的关键组成部分。

3. 金属氧化物的基本结构是离子性的，氧离子形成六角紧密堆积层，金属离子占据八面体或四面体间隙。

4. 关于离子晶体表面的稳定性，Tasker（13）首先进行了讨论，并由Noguera（14）和Goniakowski等（15）提供了更深入和全面的回顾。这一概念有助于根据其极性解释氧化物表面的行为。

5. 在ZnO(0001)-Zn表面上存在的步骤边缘为Brnsted酸的分解提供活性位点。此外，完全羟基化的（1×1）ZnO(000 1)-OH表面与无氢（重构）表面有显著差异。

6. 在TiO2(110)表面上，缺失的桥接氧原子导致形成在扫描隧道显微镜（STM）图像中表现为较暗亮斑点的空位。

7. 相对于氧空位，Ti间质的扩散更容易，这是TiO2表面化学的一个关键特征。

8. 通过蒸镀金属到基板上并随后氧化，可以制备超薄金属氧化物薄膜，理想情况下，这些薄膜具有已知的、可重复的结构，适用于STM和表面光谱分析。
