[I. INTRODUCTION]
Typical examples of such failures are Mott insulators like 3d-transition- metal oxides, where the LSDA cannot reproduce the well- established correlation gaps nor the antiferromagnetic ground states.
[II. METHOD]
The only possible choice to avoid this is to use such a set of one-electron orbitals on every site for which the energy of the highest occupied or lowest empty state (thus,we unavoidably must introduce some gap between these two energies) would exactly agree with the cost to remove or to add one electron to the shell of localized states, i.e.,with the ionization energy or electron affinity,respectively.
[III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION]
The main result of these calculations is the strong dependence of the U parameters on the valence configuration [in this work,we have considered only T + and T + states which correspond to the configurations (sp)2d" and (sp) d"+ ] of the impurities.
[IV. SUMMA. RY]
We have shown that it can be considered as a constrained LDA with additional corrections describing the spin- and orbital-polarization effects.

1. Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) fails to accurately describe properties of systems with localized d and f electrons, particularly in Mott insulators like 3d-transition metal oxides. It cannot reproduce correlation gaps and antiferromagnetic ground states.

2. To avoid this issue, one must introduce a gap between the highest occupied and lowest empty states. This gap corresponds to the energy required to remove or add an electron, either the ionization energy or electron affinity.

3. Calculations reveal that the U parameters of the Coulomb interaction significantly depend on the valence configuration of the impurities. The configurations (sp)2d" and (sp) d"+ correspond to T + and T + states, respectively.

4. The method presented can be seen as a constrained Local Density Approximation (LDA) with added corrections to account for spin and orbital polarization effects. This enhancement incorporates the discontinuity of the one-electron potential found in exact density functional theory.

1. LSDA在描述具有局部化d和f电子的体系时存在失败，特别是在莫特绝缘体如3d过渡金属氧化物中。它无法重现关联间隙和反铁磁基态。

2. 为了避免这个问题，必须在最高占据状态和最低空闲状态之间引入一个间隙。这个间隙对应于移除或添加一个电子所需的能量，即电离能或电子亲和能。

3. 计算表明，Coulomb相互作用的U参数强烈依赖于杂质的价态配置。配置(sp)2d"和(sp)d+“分别对应于T+和T+状态。

4. 所提出的方法可以被视为受限LDA，附加了对自旋和轨道极化效应的修正。这整合了精确密度函数理论中发现的一电子势的断裂。
