[I. INTRODUCTION] Typical examples of such failures are Mott insulators like 3d-transition- metal oxides, where the LSDA cannot reproduce the well-established correlation gaps nor the antiferromagnetic ground states.
[II. METHOD] Our main idea is to modify that part of the LDA-total energy which is responsible for the interaction between localized electrons and present it in the same way as it appears in model (Anderson2s or Hubbardl) Hamiltonians.
[III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION] The U and J parameters calculated in accordance with Eqs. (6),(7) for all 3d, 4d, and Sd impurities in Rb are
[IV. SUMMA. RY] In conclusion,we have derived a version of the LDA+U formalism which allows us to reproduce the "atomic limit" in band structure calculations and is suitable for the description of systems with strongly localized electrons.

1. Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) fails to describe properties of systems with localized d and f electrons, such as Mott insulators like 3d-transition metal oxides, which lack reproduction of correlation gaps and antiferromagnetic ground states.

2. The core idea is to adjust the part of the Local Density Approximation (LDA) energy that deals with electron interactions to resemble the interaction in Anderson's or Hubbard's Hamiltonians.

3. The U and J parameters, crucial for understanding localized electron behavior, have been calculated for all 3d, 4d, and 5d impurities in Rb according to Equations (6) and (7).

4. A modified version of the LDA+U formalism has been derived that can accurately reproduce the "atomic limit" in band structure calculations, effectively describing systems with strongly localized electrons.

1. LSDA无法描述诸如3d过渡金属氧化物等局部化d和f电子系统的特性，例如莫特绝缘体，无法重现关联间隙或反铁磁基态。

2. 核心理念是调整LDA能量中处理电子相互作用的部分，使其与Anderson或Hubbard的Hamiltonians中的相互作用相一致。

3. 根据方程（6）和（7），已经计算出了所有3d、4d和5d杂质在Rb中的U和J参数。

4. 一种能够准确再现“原子极限”在带结构计算中的LDA+U正则化的形式已被提出，有效描述了具有强烈局部化电子的系统。
