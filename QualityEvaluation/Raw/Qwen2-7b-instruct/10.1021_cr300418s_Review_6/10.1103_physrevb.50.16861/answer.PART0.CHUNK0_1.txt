[I. INTRODUCTION] "Typical examples of such failures are Mott insulators like 3d-transition- metal oxides, where the LSDA cannot reproduce the well- established correlation gaps nor the antiferromagnetic ground states."
[II. METHOD] "Our main idea is to modify that part of the LDA-total energy which is responsible for the interaction between localized electrons and present it in the same way as it appears in model (Anderson2s or Hubbardl) Hamiltonians."
[III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION] "The main result of these calculations is the strong dependence of the U parameters on the valence configuration [in this work,we have considered only T + and T + states which correspond to the configurations (sp)2d" and (sp) d"+ ]."
[IV. SUMMA. RY] "We have shown that it can be considered as a constrained LDA with additional corrections describing the spin- and orbital-polarization effects."

1. The Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA) fails to accurately model properties of systems containing localized d and f electrons, such as Mott insulators like 3d-transition-metal oxides. 

2. The authors propose modifying the interaction between localized electrons in the LSDA to resemble that found in Anderson or Hubbard Hamiltonians. 

3. The U parameters, which characterize the strength of electron-electron interactions, show a significant dependence on the valence configuration of d impurities. 

4. The proposed method can be viewed as a constrained Local Density Approximation (LDA) with additional corrections for spin and orbital polarization effects.

1. 类似于3d过渡金属氧化物这样的莫特绝缘体，局部自旋密度近似(LSDA)无法重现已建立的相关间隙或反铁磁基态。

2. 作者提议修改LSDA中局部电子之间的相互作用，使其与安德森或Hubbard哈密顿量中的相互作用形式相同。

3.U参数在d掺杂体的价态配置上显示出显著的依赖性。U参数表征电子间的相互作用强度。

4. 提出的方法可以视为受约束的局部密度近似(LDA)，带有额外的自旋和轨道极化效应修正。
