[1] "As Dimakis and Bunker wrote in 1999, describing their APEX program: There has long been a need for a basic set of x-ray absorption fine-structure analysis (XAFS) programs that are freely available, including source code; that runs on all major operating systems; is readily extensible; is easy to use for beginners; and is a useful tool for experts."
[2] "In addition to the requirements that Dimakis and Bunker set, I would also add: the use of robust EXAFS analysis procedures, and a facility for users to write macros, scripts, or even programs of varying levels of sophistication for repetitious analysis tasks."
[3] "The need for form-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to otherwise complex EXAFS analysis procedures is probably obvious to the reader, as is the need for predictability, uniformity, and correctness of the analysis procedures used."
[4] "G.I.FEFFIT is still in development. At this writing it does not have a complete form-based interface to FEFFIT-type fitting of XAFS data, but it is an easy-to-use, flexible program for simple data processing, plotting, background subtraction, and Fourier transforms."

The document discusses the development and features of IFEFFIT, an interactive program designed for XAFS analysis. It combines the core algorithms of AUTOBK and FEFFIT with general data manipulation and interactive graphics into a single package. IFEFFIT offers a command-line interface and a library of functions that can be used from various scripting languages, including C, Fortran, and high-level languages like Python, Perl, and Tcl. The program supports data manipulation, XAFS analysis procedures, plotting, and simple algebraic operations. However, the graphical user interface (GUI) for FEFFIT-type fitting of XAFS data is still under development, though G.I.FEFFIT provides an easy-to-use, flexible program for simple data processing, plotting, background subtraction, and Fourier transforms.

文档讨论了IFEFFIT的发展及其特性，这是一个专门为XAFS分析设计的交互式程序。它将AUTOBK和FEFFIT的核心算法与通用数据操作和交互式图形结合成一个单一的包。IFEFFIT提供命令行界面和可以从C、Fortran以及Python、Perl和Tcl等高级语言调用的功能库。该程序支持数据操作、XAFS分析方法、绘图和基本代数运算。然而，用于FEFFIT类型的XAFS数据拟合的图形用户界面（GUI）仍在开发中，尽管G.I.FEFFIT提供了一个易于使用、灵活的程序进行简单的数据分析、绘图、背景减除和傅里叶变换。
