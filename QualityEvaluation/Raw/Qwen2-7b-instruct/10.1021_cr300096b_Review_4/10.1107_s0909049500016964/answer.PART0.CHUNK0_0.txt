[1] "As Dimakis and Bunker wrote in 1999(Dimakis & Bunker, 1999), describing their APEX program: There has long been a need for a basic set of x-ray absorption fine-structure analysis (XAFS) programs that are freely available, including source code; that runs on all major operating systems; is readily extensible; is easy to use for beginners; and is a useful tool for experts."
[2] "The availability of high-quality and easy-to-use programs for data analysis is of primary importance for beamlines and practitioners of XAFS."
[3] "IFEFFIT is freely available with an Open Source license. Outside use, development, and contributions are encouraged."
