[1] "The availability of high-quality and easy-to-use programs for data analysis is of primary importance for beamlines and practitioners of XAFS."
[2] "The need for form-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to otherwise complex EXAFS analysis procedures is probably obvious to the reader, as is the need for predictability, uniformity, and correctness of the analysis procedures used."
[3] "IFEFFIT uses the PGPLOT(Pearson, 1997) graphics library for plotting data. Currently, this library works well to produce plots for X Windows, in Postscript, and in GIF."
[4] "IFEFFIT is freely available with an Open Source license. Outside use, development, and contributions are encouraged."
[5] "G.I.FEFFIT is still in development. At this writing it does not have a complete form-based interface to FEFFIT-type fitting of XAFS data, but it is an easy-to-use, flexible program for simple data processing, plotting, background subtraction, and Fourier transforms."

The document describes IFEFFIT, an interactive program and scriptable library of XAFS algorithms designed for XAFS data analysis. It is freely available with an Open Source license and includes features such as background removal, Fourier transforms, and modeling and fitting of XAFS data using FEFF calculations. IFEFFIT also provides plotting capabilities and supports the creation of macros, scripts, or programs for repetitive analysis tasks. However, G.I.FEFFIT, a graphical interface for IFEFFIT, is still in development and lacks a complete interface for fitting XAFS data. Despite this, it offers easy-to-use functionalities for simple data processing, plotting, background subtraction, and Fourier transforms.

文档描述了IFEFFIT，一个用于XAFS数据分析的交互式程序和可脚本化的XAFS算法库。它以开放源代码许可形式免费提供，并包含背景移除、傅立叶变换和使用FEFF计算对XAFS数据建模和拟合的功能。IFEFFIT还提供了绘图功能，并支持创建宏、脚本或程序以执行重复的分析任务。然而，G.I.FEFFIT，IFEFFIT的图形界面，仍在开发中，缺少完整的用于拟合XAFS数据的界面。尽管如此，它仍提供了易于使用的功能进行简单的数据处理、绘图、背景去除和傅立叶变换。
