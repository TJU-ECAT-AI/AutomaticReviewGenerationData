[1] "As Dimakis and Bunker wrote in 1999, describing their APEX program: There has long been a need for a basic set of x-ray absorption fine-structure analysis (XAFS) programs that are freely available, including source code; that runs on all major operating systems; is readily extensible; is easy to use for beginners; and is a useful tool for experts."
[2] "This is an ambitious set of requirements, but certainly achievable,as Dimakis and Bunker have shown with their wrapper for the freely available batch-processing UW/NRL Fortran programs."
[3] "In addition to the requirements that Dimakis and Bunker set, I would also add: the use of robust EXAFS analysis procedures, and a facility for users to write macros, scripts, or even programs of varying levels of sophistication for repetitious analysis tasks."
[4] "The need for form-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to otherwise complex EXAFS analysis procedures is probably obvious to the reader, as is the need for predictability, uniformity, and correctness of the analysis procedures used."
[5] "IFEFFIT, an interactive program and scriptable library of XAFS al- gorithms is presented. The core algorithms of AUTOBK and FEFFIT have been combined with general data manipulation and interactive graphics into a single package."
[6] "IFEFFIT provides the user with the ability to create, read, and write data into named program variables in the IFEFFIT session."
[7] "Because many commands are repeated for analysis of XAFS data, and because it is desirable to be able to apply identical pro- cedures for different sets of data, IFEFFIT has a simple facility for writing and saving macros of commands: multiple commands that are executed with a single user-defined macro name."
[8] "IFEFFIT uses the PGPLOT(Pearson, 1997) graphics library for plotting data."
[9] "The IFEFFIT library is written in Fortran, and can be used from Fortran or C programs. Special attention has been given to ensure that this library can also be used from high-level scripting languages such as Tcl(Ousterhout, 1994), Perl(Wall et al., 1997), and Python(von Rossum, 1995; Lutz & Ascher, 1999)."
[10] "G.I.FEFFIT: Graphical Interactive FEFFIT has been written. While essentially an enhanced command-line program, G.I.FEFFIT provides graphical forms to assist common analysis tasks such as reading and writ- ing data files, plotting arrays, and simple XAFS analysis tasks like pre-edge subtraction, normalization, post-edge background re- moval and Fourier transforms."

The literature discusses the development and capabilities of IFEFFIT, an interactive program and scriptable library for XAFS analysis, and G.I.FEFFIT, a graphical interface for performing common XAFS analysis tasks. It highlights the need for robust EXAFS analysis procedures, user macros, and scripting capabilities for repetitive tasks. The literature also mentions the use of PGPLOT for data visualization and the compatibility of IFEFFIT with various programming languages and scripting environments. G.I.FEFFIT is described as an enhanced command-line interface with graphical forms for tasks such as data plotting and background removal.
