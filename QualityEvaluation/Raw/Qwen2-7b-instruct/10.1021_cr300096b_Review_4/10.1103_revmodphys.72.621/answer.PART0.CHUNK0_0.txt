1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques in characterizing bimetallic catalysts employ methodologies like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). XPS provides details on the electronic states and chemical environment of metal sites. TPD helps determine surface species and their stability, crucial for understanding active sites. FTIR offers qualitative insights into functional groups and interactions between adsorbates and metal surfaces. CO chemisorption is sensitive to metal surface coverage and electronic properties, while H2 chemisorption reveals metal dispersion and alloy phases, essential for assessing activity. Both techniques have limitations related to sample preparation quality and potential interferences. Data interpretation needs to consider experimental parameters like temperature, pressure, and support material nature. Normalization of reaction rates involves accounting for kinetic behavior and thermodynamic stability of adsorbed complexes.

1. 在表金属催化剂的比较中，CO和H2化学吸附技术使用的方法包括X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、程序升温脱附（TPD）和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）。XPS提供了关于吸附分子的电子状态和金属位点化学环境的详细信息。TPD有助于确定表面物种的性质及其稳定性，这对于理解催化剂上的活性位点至关重要。FTIR提供了关于表面存在的功能基团的定性信息以及吸附剂与金属表面之间的相互作用。CO化学吸附对金属表面覆盖度敏感，并提供了有关催化剂电子性质的信息，而H2化学吸附则揭示了金属在支撑材料上的分散情况和合金相的存在，这对于评估表金属催化剂的活性是必要的。两种技术都存在样本准备质量要求和潜在干扰物的问题。数据解释需要考虑实验参数如温度、压力和支持材料的性质。反应速率的标准化涉及对吸附复合物的动力学行为和热力学稳定性的考虑。
