Answer: There are no specific quotes in the provided literature that directly compare CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. However, the literature focuses on theoretical approaches to X-ray absorption fine structure, which could indirectly inform the understanding of surface chemistry involved in catalysis. For a detailed comparison of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques, one might need to refer to other sources within the field of surface science and catalysis.

答案：提供的文献中没有直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的相关引文。然而，文献专注于X射线吸收精细结构的理论方法，这可能间接地影响对催化表面化学的理解。对于CO和H2化学吸附技术的详细比较，可能需要参考表面科学和催化领域的其他来源。
