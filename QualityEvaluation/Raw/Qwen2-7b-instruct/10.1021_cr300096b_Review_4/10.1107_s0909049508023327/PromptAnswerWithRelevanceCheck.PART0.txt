[1] "The experiments carried out demonstrate the feasibility of a three-technique set-up to obtain in situ correlated data at the nanometre to micrometre scale, enabling new insight into materials self-assembly and catalytic processes."
[2] "The equipment is designed to be able to follow processes for which a time resolution of approximately 10 frames min−1 is sufficient."
[3] "The choice of when it is sensible to use a combination of simultaneous techniques is something that has to be carefully weighed up since in most cases this approach results in the loss of some data quality in at least one of the techniques."
[4] "The time-resolved experiments were performed in the QEXAFS mode in which the monochromator is scanned rapidly (non-stop) around a specific absorption edge in combination with (quasi-)simultaneous WAXS and SAXS data collection at a fixed energy."
[5] "The implication for the similarity of the average SAXS aggregate size to that of the first crystallite is that a type of gel reorganization precedes the formation of crystalline AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases."

The combined SAXS/WAXS/QEXAFS set-up enables the study of materials self-assembly and catalytic processes at the nanometre to micrometre scale with a time resolution of approximately 10 frames per minute. The choice of using multiple techniques simultaneously needs careful consideration due to potential data quality loss. The equipment facilitates in situ measurements, allowing for the observation of processes such as the formation of AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases, where the similarity in average SAXS aggregate size to the first crystallite suggests a gel reorganization preceding crystallization.

结合SAXS/WAXS/QEXAFS设置允许在纳米到微米尺度上研究材料自组装和催化过程，并以每分钟约10帧的速度进行。同时使用多种技术的选择需要仔细考虑，因为这可能导致至少一个技术的数据质量下降。该设备支持原位测量，允许观察诸如AlPO-5和ZnAPO-34相形成这样的过程，其中平均SAXS聚合体大小与第一个结晶体的相似性表明存在胶体重组先于结晶化的过程。

[3] "An example of the loss of data quality is, for instance, in the over- and under-focus of the X-ray beam in a combined SAXS/WAXS experiment in the SAXS and WAXS detectors,respectively."
[4] "Obviously this principle can be extended to the combination of synchrotron radiation techniques with non-X-ray-based techniques such as differential scattering calorimetry (DSC) and SAXS/WAXS (Bras, Derbyshire, Devine et al., 1995), light scattering/SAXS/WAXS (Zachmann & Wutz, 1993), Raman scattering/SAXS/WAXS (Bryant et al., 1998), SAXS/FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) (Bras, Derbyshire, Bogg et al., 1995), XAFS/FTIR (Newton et al., 2004), UVVis/ Raman/XAFS for both gas and liquid phase heterogeneous catalysis (Beale et al., 2005; Briois et al., 2005) etc (Bras & Ryan, 1998)."

The three-technique set-up enables in situ correlated data collection at the nanometre to micrometre scale, providing new insights into materials self-assembly and catalytic processes. Combining techniques can be beneficial but must be carefully considered due to potential data quality loss in individual techniques. Losses in quality may occur due to issues like X-ray beam over- and under-focus in combined SAXS/WAXS experiments. Extensions of the principle of combining techniques include integrating synchrotron radiation techniques with non-X-ray-based methods such as differential scattering calorimetry (DSC), light scattering, Raman scattering, SAXS/FTIR, XAFS/FTIR, UVVis/Raman/XAFS for both gas and liquid phase heterogeneous catalysis, among others.

这套三技术组合系统可以在纳米到微米尺度上实现原位相关数据收集，为材料自组装和催化过程提供新的见解。结合技术可以带来好处，但必须仔细考虑，因为这可能导致个别技术的数据质量损失。在联合SAXS/WAXS实验中，X射线束可能因过聚焦或欠聚焦而出现质量损失。技术整合的原理还可以扩展到将同步辐射技术与非X射线方法（如差热分析（DSC）、散射光谱、拉曼散射、SAXS/FTIR、XAFS/FTIR、UVVis/Raman/XAFS等）结合使用，特别是在气相和液相异质催化剂的研究中。

[1] "The experiments were carried out on the Dutch Belgian beamline BM26A at the ESRF (Borsboom et al., 1998)."
[2] "The addition of SAXS to the already existing combined XAFS/diffraction set-up is somewhat complicated since a long kapton-windowed (two windows both 40 mm thick) vacuum chamber has to be inserted between the sample and the SAXS detector."
[3] "In order to completely describe the whole process it will be clear that one has to start from a well characterized sample and that the final product again should be well characterized, maybe not only with the techniques used in the experiment but also by additional techniques that can render extra information such as microscopy (scanning and transmission electron microscopy etc.)."
[4] "The implication for the similarity of the average SAXS aggregate size to that of the first crystallite is that a type of gel reorganization precedes the formation of crystalline AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases."
[5] "However, as heating began, dramatic changes in all three techniques (SAXS/WAXS/XAFS) occurred, which suggested that the initial FeMo phase was unstable up to a certain temperature."
[6] "Such observations have important implications when determining the stability and activity of this catalyst under reaction conditions."

1. The experiments were conducted on the Dutch Belgian beamline BM26A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). 
2. Incorporating Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) into the existing setup requires a long Kapton windowed vacuum chamber to be placed between the sample and the SAXS detector due to the complexity involved.
3. To fully describe the entire process, one must start with a well-characterized sample and ensure the final product is similarly characterized using not only the techniques employed in the experiment but also additional techniques like microscopy.
4. The similarity in the average SAXS aggregate size to the first crystallite suggests a gel reorganization occurs prior to the formation of crystalline AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases.
5. The catalyst's initial phase underwent significant changes in all three techniques (SAXS, WAXS, XAFS) during heating, indicating instability up to a certain temperature.
6. These findings have significant implications for understanding the catalyst's stability and activity under reaction conditions.

1. 实验在荷兰比利时束线BM26A上进行，位于欧洲同步辐射设施（ESRF）。
2. 将小角X射线散射（SAXS）集成到现有的设置中需要一个长的Kapton窗口真空室放置在样品和SAXS探测器之间，以解决复杂性问题。
3. 要完全描述整个过程，必须从一个特征明显的样品开始，并确保最终产物通过不仅使用实验中使用的技术，还可以通过额外的技术（如扫描和透射电子显微镜等）获得额外信息来进行特征化。
4. 平均SAXS聚集体尺寸与第一个结晶体相似的事实表明，在形成AlPO-5和ZnAPO-34晶体之前发生了一种凝胶重组。
5. 在加热过程中，催化剂的初始相在所有三个技术（SAXS、WAXS、XAFS）中发生了显著变化，表明其在一定温度下不稳定。
6. 这些发现对确定催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和活性具有重要意义。

[3] "The data acquisition software was developed at the SRS Daresbury Laboratory and adapted to be able to control the motor and detector systems of the BM26A beamline."
[4] "Depending on the design of the sample cell, it is feasible to also collect data using non-X-ray-based techniques; in the case where optical methods are employed, the implementation is fairly straightforward."
[5] "Since such processes normally take place over a number of hours, the time resolution was accordingly adapted to the process and set to 5 min frame1."
[6] "This sort of time resolution will mean that the set-up will be applicable for studying many chemical/physical processes in the chemical industries, but there are also many examples (e.g. formation of nanoparticles, polymers etc.) where more fundamental research can benefit from the availability of such experimental equipment."

The addition of Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) to the existing setup is complicated due to the necessity of inserting a long kapton windowed vacuum chamber between the sample and the SAXS detector. Data collection software was developed and customized for controlling the motor and detector systems of the BM26A beamline. Non-X-ray-based techniques can be integrated into the setup with ease, especially when optical methods are utilized. The time resolution was adjusted based on the duration of the chemical processes, typically set at 5 minutes per frame. This level of time resolution enables the study of various chemical and physical processes in the chemical industry, as well as fundamental research in areas such as nanoparticle and polymer formation.

实验在ESRF的荷兰比利时束线BM26A上进行。将小角度X射线散射（SAXS）添加到现有设置中有些复杂，因为需要在样品和SAXS探测器之间插入一个长的kapton窗口真空室。开发并定制了数据采集软件以控制BM26A束线的电机和探测器系统。可以轻松地将非X射线技术集成到设置中，尤其是在使用光学方法的情况下。时间分辨率根据化学过程的持续时间进行调整，通常设置为每帧5分钟。这种时间分辨率允许研究化学工业中的各种化学和物理过程，以及纳米颗粒和聚合物形成等基本研究领域。
