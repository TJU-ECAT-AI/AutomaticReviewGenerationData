[1] "The experiments were carried out on the Dutch Belgian beamline BM26A at the ESRF (Borsboom et al., 1998)."
[2] "The addition of SAXS to the already existing combined XAFS/diffraction set-up is somewhat complicated since a long kapton-windowed (two windows both 40 mm thick) vacuum chamber has to be inserted between the sample and the SAXS detector."
[3] "The data acquisition software was developed at the SRS Daresbury Laboratory and adapted to be able to control the motor and detector systems of the BM26A beamline."
[4] "Depending on the design of the sample cell, it is feasible to also collect data using non-X-ray-based techniques; in the case where optical methods are employed, the implementation is fairly straightforward."
[5] "Since such processes normally take place over a number of hours, the time resolution was accordingly adapted to the process and set to 5 min frame1."
[6] "This sort of time resolution will mean that the set-up will be applicable for studying many chemical/physical processes in the chemical industries, but there are also many examples (e.g. formation of nanoparticles, polymers etc.) where more fundamental research can benefit from the availability of such experimental equipment."

The experiments were conducted on the Dutch Belgian beamline BM26A at the ESRF. The addition of Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) to the existing setup is complicated due to the necessity of inserting a long kapton windowed vacuum chamber between the sample and the SAXS detector. Data collection software was developed and customized for controlling the motor and detector systems of the BM26A beamline. Non-X-ray-based techniques can be integrated into the setup with ease, especially when optical methods are utilized. The time resolution was adjusted based on the duration of the chemical processes, typically set at 5 minutes per frame. This level of time resolution enables the study of various chemical and physical processes in the chemical industry, as well as fundamental research in areas such as nanoparticle and polymer formation.

实验在ESRF的荷兰比利时束线BM26A上进行。将小角度X射线散射（SAXS）添加到现有设置中有些复杂，因为需要在样品和SAXS探测器之间插入一个长的kapton窗口真空室。开发并定制了数据采集软件以控制BM26A束线的电机和探测器系统。可以轻松地将非X射线技术集成到设置中，尤其是在使用光学方法的情况下。时间分辨率根据化学过程的持续时间进行调整，通常设置为每帧5分钟。这种时间分辨率允许研究化学工业中的各种化学和物理过程，以及纳米颗粒和聚合物形成等基本研究领域。
