[1] "The experiments were carried out on the Dutch Belgian beamline BM26A at the ESRF (Borsboom et al., 1998)."
[2] "The addition of SAXS to the already existing combined XAFS/diffraction set-up is somewhat complicated since a long kapton-windowed (two windows both 40 mm thick) vacuum chamber has to be inserted between the sample and the SAXS detector."
[3] "In order to completely describe the whole process it will be clear that one has to start from a well characterized sample and that the final product again should be well characterized, maybe not only with the techniques used in the experiment but also by additional techniques that can render extra information such as microscopy (scanning and transmission electron microscopy etc.)."
[4] "The implication for the similarity of the average SAXS aggregate size to that of the first crystallite is that a type of gel reorganization precedes the formation of crystalline AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases."
[5] "However, as heating began, dramatic changes in all three techniques (SAXS/WAXS/XAFS) occurred, which suggested that the initial FeMo phase was unstable up to a certain temperature."
[6] "Such observations have important implications when determining the stability and activity of this catalyst under reaction conditions."

1. The experiments were conducted on the Dutch Belgian beamline BM26A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). 
2. Incorporating Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) into the existing setup requires a long Kapton windowed vacuum chamber to be placed between the sample and the SAXS detector due to the complexity involved.
3. To fully describe the entire process, one must start with a well-characterized sample and ensure the final product is similarly characterized using not only the techniques employed in the experiment but also additional techniques like microscopy.
4. The similarity in the average SAXS aggregate size to the first crystallite suggests a gel reorganization occurs prior to the formation of crystalline AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases.
5. The catalyst's initial phase underwent significant changes in all three techniques (SAXS, WAXS, XAFS) during heating, indicating instability up to a certain temperature.
6. These findings have significant implications for understanding the catalyst's stability and activity under reaction conditions.

1. 实验在荷兰比利时束线BM26A上进行，位于欧洲同步辐射设施（ESRF）。
2. 将小角X射线散射（SAXS）集成到现有的设置中需要一个长的Kapton窗口真空室放置在样品和SAXS探测器之间，以解决复杂性问题。
3. 要完全描述整个过程，必须从一个特征明显的样品开始，并确保最终产物通过不仅使用实验中使用的技术，还可以通过额外的技术（如扫描和透射电子显微镜等）获得额外信息来进行特征化。
4. 平均SAXS聚集体尺寸与第一个结晶体相似的事实表明，在形成AlPO-5和ZnAPO-34晶体之前发生了一种凝胶重组。
5. 在加热过程中，催化剂的初始相在所有三个技术（SAXS、WAXS、XAFS）中发生了显著变化，表明其在一定温度下不稳定。
6. 这些发现对确定催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性和活性具有重要意义。
