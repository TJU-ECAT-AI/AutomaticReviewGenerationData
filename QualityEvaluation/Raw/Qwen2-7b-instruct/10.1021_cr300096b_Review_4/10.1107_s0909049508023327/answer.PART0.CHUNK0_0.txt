[1] "The experiments carried out demonstrate the feasibility of a three-technique set-up to obtain in situ correlated data at the nanometre to micrometre scale, enabling new insight into materials self-assembly and catalytic processes."
[2] "The equipment is designed to be able to follow processes for which a time resolution of approximately 10 frames min−1 is sufficient."
[3] "The choice of when it is sensible to use a combination of simultaneous techniques is something that has to be carefully weighed up since in most cases this approach results in the loss of some data quality in at least one of the techniques."
[4] "The time-resolved experiments were performed in the QEXAFS mode in which the monochromator is scanned rapidly (non-stop) around a specific absorption edge in combination with (quasi-)simultaneous WAXS and SAXS data collection at a fixed energy."
[5] "The implication for the similarity of the average SAXS aggregate size to that of the first crystallite is that a type of gel reorganization precedes the formation of crystalline AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases."

The combined SAXS/WAXS/QEXAFS set-up enables the study of materials self-assembly and catalytic processes at the nanometre to micrometre scale with a time resolution of approximately 10 frames per minute. The choice of using multiple techniques simultaneously needs careful consideration due to potential data quality loss. The equipment facilitates in situ measurements, allowing for the observation of processes such as the formation of AlPO-5 and ZnAPO-34 phases, where the similarity in average SAXS aggregate size to the first crystallite suggests a gel reorganization preceding crystallization.

结合SAXS/WAXS/QEXAFS设置允许在纳米到微米尺度上研究材料自组装和催化过程，并以每分钟约10帧的速度进行。同时使用多种技术的选择需要仔细考虑，因为这可能导致至少一个技术的数据质量下降。该设备支持原位测量，允许观察诸如AlPO-5和ZnAPO-34相形成这样的过程，其中平均SAXS聚合体大小与第一个结晶体的相似性表明存在胶体重组先于结晶化的过程。
