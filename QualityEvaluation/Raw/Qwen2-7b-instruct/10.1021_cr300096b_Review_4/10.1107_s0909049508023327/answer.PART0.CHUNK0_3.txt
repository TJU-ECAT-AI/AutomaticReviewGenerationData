[1] "The experiments carried out demonstrate the feasibility of a three-technique set-up to obtain in situ correlated data at the nanometre to micrometre scale, enabling new insight into materials self-assembly and catalytic processes."
[2] "The choice of when it is sensible to use a combination of simultaneous techniques is something that has to be carefully weighed up since in most cases this approach results in the loss of some data quality in at least one of the techniques."
[3] "The flexibility of this set-up for studying other processes and for incorporating other additional non-X-ray-based experimental techniques has also been explored and demonstrated for studying the stability/ activity of iron molybdate catalysts for the anaerobic decomposition of methanol."

The three-technique set-up enables researchers to obtain in situ correlated data at the nanometer to micrometer scale, offering new insights into materials self-assembly and catalytic processes. The choice to use a combination of simultaneous techniques requires careful consideration due to the potential loss of data quality in at least one technique. This set-up has been successfully applied to study the stability and activity of iron molybdate catalysts for the anaerobic decomposition of methanol.
