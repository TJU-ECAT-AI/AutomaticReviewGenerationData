[1] "The experiments carried out demonstrate the feasibility of a three-technique set-up to obtain in situ correlated data at the nanometre to micrometre scale, enabling new insight into materials self-assembly and catalytic processes."
[2] "The choice of when it is sensible to use a combination of simultaneous techniques is something that has to be carefully weighed up since in most cases this approach results in the loss of some data quality in at least one of the techniques."
[3] "An example of the loss of data quality is, for instance, in the over- and under-focus of the X-ray beam in a combined SAXS/WAXS experiment in the SAXS and WAXS detectors,respectively."
[4] "Obviously this principle can be extended to the combination of synchrotron radiation techniques with non-X-ray-based techniques such as differential scattering calorimetry (DSC) and SAXS/WAXS (Bras, Derbyshire, Devine et al., 1995), light scattering/SAXS/WAXS (Zachmann & Wutz, 1993), Raman scattering/SAXS/WAXS (Bryant et al., 1998), SAXS/FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) (Bras, Derbyshire, Bogg et al., 1995), XAFS/FTIR (Newton et al., 2004), UVVis/ Raman/XAFS for both gas and liquid phase heterogeneous catalysis (Beale et al., 2005; Briois et al., 2005) etc (Bras & Ryan, 1998)."

The three-technique set-up enables in situ correlated data collection at the nanometre to micrometre scale, providing new insights into materials self-assembly and catalytic processes. Combining techniques can be beneficial but must be carefully considered due to potential data quality loss in individual techniques. Losses in quality may occur due to issues like X-ray beam over- and under-focus in combined SAXS/WAXS experiments. Extensions of the principle of combining techniques include integrating synchrotron radiation techniques with non-X-ray-based methods such as differential scattering calorimetry (DSC), light scattering, Raman scattering, SAXS/FTIR, XAFS/FTIR, UVVis/Raman/XAFS for both gas and liquid phase heterogeneous catalysis, among others.

这套三技术组合系统可以在纳米到微米尺度上实现原位相关数据收集，为材料自组装和催化过程提供新的见解。结合技术可以带来好处，但必须仔细考虑，因为这可能导致个别技术的数据质量损失。在联合SAXS/WAXS实验中，X射线束可能因过聚焦或欠聚焦而出现质量损失。技术整合的原理还可以扩展到将同步辐射技术与非X射线方法（如差热分析（DSC）、散射光谱、拉曼散射、SAXS/FTIR、XAFS/FTIR、UVVis/Raman/XAFS等）结合使用，特别是在气相和液相异质催化剂的研究中。
