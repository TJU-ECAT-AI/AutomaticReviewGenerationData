The study focused on the structural, morphological, and electronic properties of CuO/CeO2 and Ce1xCuxO2 nanocatalysts during reduction and oxidation cycles, using H2 and O2 as probes. The Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 system reoxidized to form CuO via a Cu2O intermediate phase. However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution did not fully oxidize to CuO or return to a bulk Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 phase. This behavior highlights the strong interaction between copper and the ceria matrix, demonstrating the benefits of using solid solutions of mixed oxides.

The literature discusses the reduction and reoxidation of CuO/CeO2 and Ce1xCuxO2 nanocatalysts. It highlights the differences in the reduction processes, where both types form a Cu/CeO2 biphase with significant oxygen vacancies in CeO2. The literature further explains that during reoxidation, the CuO/CeO2 blend reoxidizes to form crystalline CuO through a Cu2O intermediate, whereas the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaves differently under oxidizing conditions. The literature concludes that the strong interactions between copper and the ceria matrix in the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution illustrate the advantages of utilizing solid solutions of mixed oxides.

[1] "It has been established that CuO/CeO2 blends yield significantly higher catalytic activities than CeO2 alone."
[2] "While it has been established that CuO/CeO2 blends yield significantly higher catalytic activities than CeO2 alone, the nature of this enhancement is complex due to the flexible valence of both Cu and Ce, leading to a variable oxygen storage capacity within their native and mixed oxides."

The document discusses the catalytic properties of CuO/CeO2 blends compared to CeO2 alone. It highlights that CuO/CeO2 blends exhibit significantly higher catalytic activities than CeO2 alone. This enhanced activity is attributed to the complex interplay between the variable valences of copper (Cu) and cerium (Ce), which allows for a flexible oxygen storage capacity within their native and mixed oxides. Furthermore, the strong interactions between copper and the ceria matrix in the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution demonstrate the benefits of using solid solutions of mixed oxides in catalysis.

文献讨论了CuO/CeO2混合物与仅CeO2相比的催化性质。它强调，CuO/CeO2混合物的催化活性显著高于仅CeO2。这种增强的活性归因于铜(Cu)和铈(Ce)变价之间的复杂相互作用，这允许在其本征氧化物和混合氧化物中具有可变的氧存储能力。此外，减少的Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固体溶液中的铜和氧化铈矩阵之间强烈的相互作用表明使用混合氧化物的固体溶液在催化方面的优势。

The literature discusses the reduction and reoxidation of copper oxide/ceria (CuO/CeO2) and ceria-based mixed oxide (Ce1xCuxO2) nanocatalysts using hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) as chemical probes. The catalysts reduce to a Cu/CeO2 biphase system with significant oxygen vacancies in CeO2. Variations are observed in the Cu particle size and metal dispersion depending on the initial state of the copper oxideceria systems. During subsequent oxygen annealing, the Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 system reoxidizes to form CuO through a Cu2O intermediate phase. However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaves differently under oxidizing conditions, neither fully oxidizing to CuO nor returning to a bulk Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 phase. Instead, 50% of the Cu returns to a Ce1xCuxO2 solid solution, while the remainder forms an amorphous copper oxide phase with a similar Cu oxidation state to Ce1xCuxO2 but with a local bonding environment akin to CuO. The strong interaction between copper and the ceria matrix in the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution leads to distinct behavior not observed in simple CuO/CeO2 blends.

文献讨论了使用氢（H2）和氧气（O2）作为化学探针对铜氧化物/氧化铈（CuO/CeO2）和铈基混合氧化物（Ce1xCuxO2）纳米催化剂的还原和氧化。催化剂还原为Cu/CeO2双相体系，其中CeO2中存在大量氧空位。根据初始状态的不同，观察到Cu颗粒大小和金属分散性的变化。在后续的氧退火过程中，从CuO/CeO2系统中析出的Cu通过Cu2O中间相重新氧化形成CuO。然而，从Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固溶体中析出的Cu在氧化条件下表现出不同行为，既不完全氧化为CuO，也不完全返回为固体溶液中的Ce0.8Cu0.2O2。相反，50%的Cu返回到Ce1xCuxO2固溶体中，而其余部分则形成与Ce1xCuxO2具有相似Cu氧化状态但局部结合环境类似于CuO的非晶态铜氧化物相。Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固溶体中铜与氧化铈矩阵之间的强烈相互作用导致了不同于简单CuO/CeO2混合物的独特行为。
