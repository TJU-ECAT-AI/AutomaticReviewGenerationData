[1] "We have studied the structural, morphological, and electronic properties of CuO/CeO2 and Ce1xCuxO2 nanocatalysts during reduction/oxidation cycles using H2 and O2 as chemical probes."
[2] "During subsequent in situ oxygen annealing, the Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 system reoxidized to form CuO through a Cu2O intermediate phase as expected."
[3] "However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaved rather differently under oxidizing conditions, and neither oxidized to form CuO nor fully returned to a bulk Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 phase in solid solution."
[4] "The behavior seen for the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 points to strong interactions between copper and the ceria matrix and illustrates the advantages of utilizing solid solutions of mixed oxides."

The study focused on the structural, morphological, and electronic properties of CuO/CeO2 and Ce1xCuxO2 nanocatalysts during reduction and oxidation cycles, using H2 and O2 as probes. The Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 system reoxidized to form CuO via a Cu2O intermediate phase. However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution did not fully oxidize to CuO or return to a bulk Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 phase. This behavior highlights the strong interaction between copper and the ceria matrix, demonstrating the benefits of using solid solutions of mixed oxides.

研究集中在使用H2和O2作为探针，研究CuO/CeO2和Ce1xCuxO2纳米催化剂在还原和氧化周期中的结构、形态和电子性质。从CuO/CeO2体系中析出的Cu在氧化后通过Cu2O中间相转化为CuO。然而，从Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固溶体中析出的Cu没有完全氧化为CuO或返回到纯Ce0.8Cu0.2O2相态。这种行为表明了铜与铈基质之间强烈的相互作用，并证明了使用混合氧化物固溶体的优势。
