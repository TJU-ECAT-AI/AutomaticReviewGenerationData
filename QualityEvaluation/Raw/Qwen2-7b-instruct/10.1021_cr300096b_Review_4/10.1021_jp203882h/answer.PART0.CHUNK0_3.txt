[1] "It has been established that CuO/CeO2 blends yield significantly higher catalytic activities than CeO2 alone."
[2] "While it has been established that CuO/CeO2 blends yield significantly higher catalytic activities than CeO2 alone, the nature of this enhancement is complex due to the flexible valence of both Cu and Ce, leading to a variable oxygen storage capacity within their native and mixed oxides."
[3] "The behavior of the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 reflects strong interactions between Cu and the ceria matrix and illustrates the advantages of working with solid solutions of mixed oxides."

The document discusses the catalytic properties of CuO/CeO2 blends compared to CeO2 alone. It highlights that CuO/CeO2 blends exhibit significantly higher catalytic activities than CeO2 alone. This enhanced activity is attributed to the complex interplay between the variable valences of copper (Cu) and cerium (Ce), which allows for a flexible oxygen storage capacity within their native and mixed oxides. Furthermore, the strong interactions between copper and the ceria matrix in the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution demonstrate the benefits of using solid solutions of mixed oxides in catalysis.

文献讨论了CuO/CeO2混合物与仅CeO2相比的催化性质。它强调，CuO/CeO2混合物的催化活性显著高于仅CeO2。这种增强的活性归因于铜(Cu)和铈(Ce)变价之间的复杂相互作用，这允许在其本征氧化物和混合氧化物中具有可变的氧存储能力。此外，减少的Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固体溶液中的铜和氧化铈矩阵之间强烈的相互作用表明使用混合氧化物的固体溶液在催化方面的优势。
