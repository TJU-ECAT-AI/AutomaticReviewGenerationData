<p>During the reduction process, both types of nanocatalysts (Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution and CuO/CeO2 blend) reduce to form a Cu/CeO2 biphase with significant oxygen vacancies in CeO2.</p>
<p>In the case of the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution, the formed Cu particles were smaller and better dispersed than those obtained upon reduction of the CuO/CeO2 blended system.</p>
<p>During subsequent in situ oxygen annealing, Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 blend reoxidized to form crystalline CuO through a Cu2O intermediate, as expected.</p>
<p>However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaved rather differently under oxidizing conditions and neither oxidized to form crystalline CuO nor fully returned to yield the bulk phase of a Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution.</p>
<p>Rietveld refinement of powder diffraction data showed that 50% of the Cu returned to a Ce1xCuxO2 solid solution, while the remainder was observed by in situ ETEM to form an amorphous CuOx phase with a copper oxidation state similar to that of Ce1xCuxO2, but with a local bonding environment similar to crystalline CuO.</p>
<p>The behavior seen for the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 points to strong interactions between copper and the ceria matrix and illustrates the advantages of utilizing solid solutions of mixed oxides.</p>

The literature discusses the reduction and reoxidation of CuO/CeO2 and Ce1xCuxO2 nanocatalysts. It highlights the differences in the reduction processes, where both types form a Cu/CeO2 biphase with significant oxygen vacancies in CeO2. The literature further explains that during reoxidation, the CuO/CeO2 blend reoxidizes to form crystalline CuO through a Cu2O intermediate, whereas the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaves differently under oxidizing conditions. The literature concludes that the strong interactions between copper and the ceria matrix in the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution illustrate the advantages of utilizing solid solutions of mixed oxides.

文献讨论了CuO/CeO2和Ce1xCuxO2纳米催化剂的还原和氧化。它强调了两种类型的还原过程，其中两者都形成Cu/CeO2双相结构，并在CeO2中具有显著的氧空位。文献进一步解释说，在重新氧化过程中，CuO/CeO2混合物通过Cu2O中间体转化为结晶CuO，而从Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固体溶液中沉淀出的Cu在氧化条件下表现出不同的行为。文献得出结论，Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固体溶液中的铜与铈亚矩阵之间的强相互作用说明了利用混合氧化物的固溶体的优势。
