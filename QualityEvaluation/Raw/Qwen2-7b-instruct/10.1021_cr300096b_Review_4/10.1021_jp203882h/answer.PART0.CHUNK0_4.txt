[2] "Copper oxide is used as a catalyst or catalyst precursor in many chemical reactions that involve hydrogen as a reactant or a product: methanol synthesis from CO (CO + 2H2  CH3OH) or CO2 (CO2 + 3H2  CH3OH + H2O), (2, 4) the water-gas shift reaction (CO + H2O  CO2 + H2), (2, 5, 6) methanol steam reforming (CH3OH + H2O  CO2 + 3H2), (2, 7) oxidative methanol reforming (CH3OH + 1/4O2 + 1/2H2O  CO2 + 5/2H2), (8) NO reduction (NO + H2  1/2N2 + H2O), (2, 9) etc."

The literature discusses the reduction and reoxidation of copper oxide/ceria (CuO/CeO2) and ceria-based mixed oxide (Ce1xCuxO2) nanocatalysts using hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) as chemical probes. The catalysts reduce to a Cu/CeO2 biphase system with significant oxygen vacancies in CeO2. Variations are observed in the Cu particle size and metal dispersion depending on the initial state of the copper oxideceria systems. During subsequent oxygen annealing, the Cu precipitated from the CuO/CeO2 system reoxidizes to form CuO through a Cu2O intermediate phase. However, the Cu precipitated from the Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution behaves differently under oxidizing conditions, neither fully oxidizing to CuO nor returning to a bulk Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 phase. Instead, 50% of the Cu returns to a Ce1xCuxO2 solid solution, while the remainder forms an amorphous copper oxide phase with a similar Cu oxidation state to Ce1xCuxO2 but with a local bonding environment akin to CuO. The strong interaction between copper and the ceria matrix in the reduced Ce0.8Cu0.2O2 solid solution leads to distinct behavior not observed in simple CuO/CeO2 blends.

文献讨论了使用氢（H2）和氧气（O2）作为化学探针对铜氧化物/氧化铈（CuO/CeO2）和铈基混合氧化物（Ce1xCuxO2）纳米催化剂的还原和氧化。催化剂还原为Cu/CeO2双相体系，其中CeO2中存在大量氧空位。根据初始状态的不同，观察到Cu颗粒大小和金属分散性的变化。在后续的氧退火过程中，从CuO/CeO2系统中析出的Cu通过Cu2O中间相重新氧化形成CuO。然而，从Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固溶体中析出的Cu在氧化条件下表现出不同行为，既不完全氧化为CuO，也不完全返回为固体溶液中的Ce0.8Cu0.2O2。相反，50%的Cu返回到Ce1xCuxO2固溶体中，而其余部分则形成与Ce1xCuxO2具有相似Cu氧化状态但局部结合环境类似于CuO的非晶态铜氧化物相。Ce0.8Cu0.2O2固溶体中铜与氧化铈矩阵之间的强烈相互作用导致了不同于简单CuO/CeO2混合物的独特行为。
