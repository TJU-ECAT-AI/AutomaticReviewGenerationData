The research utilized advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques for in situ analysis. Specifically, time-resolved X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted using beamline X7B at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was performed at beamline X18B, also at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Environmental transmission electron microscopy measurements were executed on the FEI Titan 80-300 microscope at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials, Brookhaven National Laboratory. These techniques enabled the researchers to monitor the structural, morphological, and electronic properties of copper oxide/ceria nanocatalysts during reduction and oxidation cycles.
