1. CO chemisorption techniques, including pulse chemisorption and FTIR studies, were used to characterize bimetallic catalysts. They helped determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion, allowing for a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites among different catalyst series.

2. The chemisorption methods provided valuable information on the adsorption sites of CO on the catalysts. However, the dispersion values might not be entirely reliable due to uncertainties in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts.

3. H2 chemisorption techniques were not specifically discussed in the document, but they are commonly used to assess the amount of hydrogen adsorbed on the catalyst surface, which can offer insights into the catalyst's performance.

1. CO化学吸附技术，包括脉冲吸附和FTIR研究，被用来表征双金属催化剂。它们有助于确定二氧化碳(CO)吸收量和金属分散度，从而提供不同催化剂系列中活性位点数量的定量比较。

2. 化学吸附方法提供了有关催化剂上CO吸附位点的重要信息。然而，由于双金属催化剂的化学计量和表面组成存在不确定性，分散度值可能不太可靠。

3. H2化学吸附技术在文档中没有具体提到，但它们通常用于评估吸附在催化剂表面的氢气量，这可以为催化剂性能提供有价值的见解。
