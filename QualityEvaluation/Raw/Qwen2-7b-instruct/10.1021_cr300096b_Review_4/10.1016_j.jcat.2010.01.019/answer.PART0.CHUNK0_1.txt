[1] "In order to study the effects of these two series of catalysts on the hydrogenation of conjugated systems, benzene and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation were chosen as probe reactions because they serve both fundamental and practical purposes."
[2] "The primary objective of the work presented in this paper is to correlate the effects of Pt:Ni atomic ratio and impregnation sequence with the extent of PtNi bimetallic bond formation and with the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of benzene and 1,3-butadiene."
[3] "The results presented in this paper clearly show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds."
[4] "In studying the effect of metal atomic ratio, it was found that hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading."
[5] "Similarly, it was found that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity in comparison with either sequentially impregnated catalyst."
