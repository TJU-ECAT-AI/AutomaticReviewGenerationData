<quotes>
<p>Both CO and H2 chemisorption techniques were employed to determine the carbon monoxide (CO) uptake and metal dispersion, as well as to monitor the gas-phase concentrations of reactants and products during the hydrogenation of benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</p>
<p>The CO chemisorption using pulse chemisorption and FTIR studies were performed to understand the adsorption sites of CO on the catalysts and to compare the number of active sites among the different series of catalysts. The data provided a quantitative comparison of the number of active sites.</p>
<p>However, due to the uncertainty in stoichiometry and surface compositions of the bimetallic catalysts, the dispersion values might not be very meaningful, but they offered a relative ranking of metal dispersion.</p>
<p>The H2 chemisorption technique, on the other hand, was not explicitly mentioned in the document. Typically, this method is used to determine the amount of hydrogen adsorbed on the catalyst surface, which can provide insights into the catalyst's activity and selectivity.</p>
