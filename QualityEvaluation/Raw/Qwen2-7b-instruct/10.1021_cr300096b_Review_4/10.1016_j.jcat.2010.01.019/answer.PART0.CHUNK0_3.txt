1. The selection of benzene and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation as probe reactions was based on their fundamental importance and practical applications in studying the effects of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation of conjugated systems.

2. Table 4 presents the summary of fitting results for the Pt LIII-edge spectra of 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Ni:Pt bimetallic catalysts, providing insights into their bonding characteristics.

3. As the amount of Ni in the catalysts increases, a trend in the data indicates an enhancement in the activity of the catalysts, which is evident from Table 4.

4. Hydrogenation activity was observed to increase with the addition of more Ni, as demonstrated in the study of metal atomic ratio.

5. The catalyst synthesized through co-impregnation technique showed the highest activity compared to those synthesized by sequential impregnation methods, according to the findings of the research.
