CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are both utilized for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption excels in detecting small amounts of metal and elucidating metal-support interactions, while H2 chemisorption offers insights into the support material's structure. Data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates require attention to kinetic effects and maintaining consistent experimental conditions.
