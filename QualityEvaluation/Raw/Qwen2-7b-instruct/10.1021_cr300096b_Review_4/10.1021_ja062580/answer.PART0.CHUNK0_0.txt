1. This combined setup enables the simultaneous observation of changes across the nano-to-micrometer size range during inorganic solid crystallization processes. It utilizes Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS), and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) techniques to provide comprehensive information on material structure and composition at different scales. These methods are particularly valuable for determining particle sizes and shapes, crystallographic details, and coordination environments around specific atoms. By integrating these approaches, researchers can better understand concurrent phenomena such as nucleation, growth, and phase transformations in complex material systems, which is crucial for enhancing our comprehension of crystallization processes and the impact of metal dispersion and active sites on catalytic activity. The setup offers real-time monitoring capabilities, which is advantageous for studying dynamic changes. However, data analysis and interpretation can be challenging due to the complexity involved in understanding the interplay of multiple physical phenomena. Key considerations for interpreting results and normalizing reaction rates include addressing instrumental effects, ensuring proper sample preparation, and maintaining consistent experimental conditions.
