The comparison of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts involves their methodologies, applications in determining active metal sites and metal dispersion, advantages, limitations, and considerations for data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates. These techniques offer insights into the surface chemistry and localization of active sites within catalyst nanoparticles, with advantages in sensitivity and detection capabilities. However, limitations include challenges in quantifying the precise number of active sites and complexities in interpreting data due to kinetic effects. Normalization of reaction rates and careful consideration of these factors are crucial for accurate analysis.
