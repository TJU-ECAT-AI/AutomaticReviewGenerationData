[1] "The Pt/Al2O3 film (but not the Pt film) showed a band at 2000 cm-1 after CO adsorption, which is a characteristic feature of supported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "When H2-saturated solvent was admitted the Pt particles sintered at room temperature as shown by STM. This structural change was very fast and could be monitored by infrared spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule."
[3] "Since cleaning with O2/H2 is not effective in the gas phase at room temperature, our results seem to indicate a favorable effect of the solvent for the cleaning."
[4] "The COL band displays a second derivative shape with a negative-going signal at the high-energy side and an increased background level at the lower-energy side of the band. This particular band-shape was only observed after reconstruction of the surface."

The Pt/Al2O3 film, but not the Pt film, showed a band at 2000 cm-1 after CO adsorption, which is a characteristic feature of supported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. When hydrogen-saturated solvent was introduced, the Pt particles underwent a process called sintering at room temperature, as evidenced by STM. This transformation was rapid and could be tracked using infrared spectroscopy with CO as a probe molecule. Our findings suggest that the solvent has a favorable impact on the cleaning process, particularly when using O2/H2. The COL band displayed a unique second derivative shape with a negative-going signal at the high-energy end and an elevated background level at the lower-energy end, which was observed solely after the surface reconstruction.

Pt/Al2O3薄膜，在吸附CO后显示出了2000 cm-1的特征峰，这是支持型Pt/Al2O3催化剂的一个显著特征。当氢饱和溶剂被引入时，铂颗粒在室温下经历了一个名为烧结的过程，这一变化通过扫描隧道显微镜得到了证实。这一转变非常迅速，并可以通过红外光谱法，以CO作为探针分子进行监测。我们的结果表明，溶剂对于清洁过程具有有利的影响，尤其是在使用O2/H2的情况下。COL带呈现出一种独特的二次导数形状，高能侧有负向信号，低能侧背景水平升高，这种形状仅在表面重构后观察到。
