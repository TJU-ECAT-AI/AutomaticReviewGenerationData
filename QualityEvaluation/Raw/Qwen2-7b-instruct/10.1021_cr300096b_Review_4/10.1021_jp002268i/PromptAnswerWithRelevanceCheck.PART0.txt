1. The STM analysis revealed that the evaporated Pt thin films have a particle-based island structure. These films, while not fully covering the Ge IRE (Al2O3 film), showed metallic characteristics as per the XPS results.
2. The Pt thin films were stable in organic solvents and under the presence of O2, H2, and CO. They developed a resistant contamination layer when exposed to air.
3. Attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) showed that O2 and H2 have a cleaning effect on the Pt films. Specifically, they remove CO and carbonate species when the solvent is saturated with H2.
4. Upon admission of H2-saturated solvent, the Pt particles underwent a sintering process at room temperature, as observed through STM. This was accompanied by enhanced infrared absorption, indicating a change in the film's morphology.
5. The findings suggest that the solvent promotes the sintering process and leads to enhanced infrared absorption, making the Pt/Al2O3 film a promising model system for investigating heterogeneous catalysis at the Pt-solvent interface.

The document describes a study on platinum (Pt) and platinum-alumina (Pt/Al2O3) thin films for investigating catalytic solid-liquid interfaces using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The films were evaporated on a Ge internal reflection element and characterized using various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and IR spectroscopy. The study monitored changes in the adsorbate layer of the Pt catalyst during cleaning with oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2). CO adsorption from CH2Cl2 was used as a probe to characterize the Pt catalyst in situ and to investigate the cleanliness of the Pt surface in the presence of a commercial organic solvent. The Pt/Al2O3 film showed a characteristic band at 2000 cm-1 in the CO adsorption spectrum, typical of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The origin of this effect was attributed to a structural change of the Pt particles induced by dissolved hydrogen, which was directly monitored using CO as a probe molecule. STM investigations revealed that the Pt particles sintered upon hydrogen treatment at room temperature, leading to a surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA).

The Pt/Al2O3 film, but not the Pt film, showed a band at 2000 cm-1 after CO adsorption, which is a characteristic feature of supported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. When hydrogen-saturated solvent was introduced, the Pt particles underwent a process called sintering at room temperature, as evidenced by STM. This transformation was rapid and could be tracked using infrared spectroscopy with CO as a probe molecule. Our findings suggest that the solvent has a favorable impact on the cleaning process, particularly when using O2/H2. The COL band displayed a unique second derivative shape with a negative-going signal at the high-energy end and an elevated background level at the lower-energy end, which was observed solely after the surface reconstruction.

The comparison of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts involves several aspects. CO chemisorption effectively reveals the presence of a contamination layer on freshly deposited Pt films, which is removed by H2 treatment, indicating the cleaning effect of H2. This process allows for the determination of active metal sites and metal dispersion on the catalyst surface. CO chemisorption is advantageous for its simplicity and ability to detect active sites, while its limitation lies in its inability to differentiate between various types of active sites. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, is crucial for understanding the structural changes on the catalyst surface, such as sintering, and for observing the enhanced infrared absorption due to the formation of larger Pt particles. The data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates require careful consideration of the kinetic parameters and the thermodynamic stability of the adsorbed species. The choice between CO and H2 depends on the specific research objectives, such as identifying active sites, monitoring structural changes, or studying the enhancement of infrared absorption.

In the context of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, CO chemisorption demonstrates the presence of large clean domains on the surface, even when the catalyst is in contact with an organic solvent. This finding is significant for understanding the interaction between the metal and the solvent, as well as the stability of the catalyst under various conditions. The band at 2000 cm-1 observed after CO adsorption on the Pt/Al2O3 film is characteristic of supported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, indicating that the interaction between the metal and the support affects the adsorption properties of the catalyst. This information is valuable for developing models to predict the behavior of supported catalysts under different conditions.

The sintering of Pt particles upon H2 treatment, observed through STM, highlights the dynamic nature of the catalyst surface under the influence of reducing agents and solvent. This process leads to structural changes that are reflected in the infrared spectra, enabling real-time monitoring of the catalyst's state. The enhanced infrared absorption resulting from the sintering process is attributed to the formation of larger Pt particles, which suggests that the size of the particles influences the enhancement factor. This finding is essential for optimizing the performance of catalysts, particularly in terms of their selectivity and stability under reaction conditions.

In summary, the combination of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure-reactivity relationships in bimetallic catalysts. The ability to monitor structural changes, determine active sites, and observe the enhancement of infrared absorption offers valuable insights into the mechanisms governing the performance of catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis.

对于双金属催化剂，CO和H2化学吸附技术之间的比较涉及到多个方面。CO化学吸附有效地揭示了刚沉积的Pt薄膜上的污染层的存在，并通过H2处理将其去除，表明了H2的清洁效果。这一过程允许确定催化剂表面的活性位点和金属分散情况。CO化学吸附的优势在于其简单性以及能够检测活性位点，而其局限性在于它无法区分不同类型的活性位点。H2化学吸附对于理解催化剂表面的结构变化至关重要，如聚集，并且可以观察到由于形成更大Pt颗粒而导致的红外吸收增强。数据解释和反应速率归一化需要仔细考虑动力学参数和吸附物种的热力学稳定性。在选择CO和H2时，应根据特定的研究目标来决定，例如识别活性位点、监测结构变化或研究红外吸收增强。

在Pt/Al2O3催化剂的背景下，CO化学吸附显示出表面存在大量干净的区域，即使催化剂与有机溶剂接触也是如此。这一发现对于理解金属与溶剂之间的相互作用以及催化剂在不同条件下的稳定性具有重要意义。在Pt/Al2O3薄膜上吸附后观察到的2000 cm-1波段是支持型Pt/Al2O3催化剂的特征，这表明金属与支持物之间的相互作用影响了催化剂的吸附性质。这些信息对于开发预测在不同条件下支持催化剂行为的模型非常重要。

在H2处理下Pt颗粒的聚集，通过扫描隧道显微镜（STM）观察到，强调了催化剂表面在还原剂和溶剂的影响下的动态性质。这一过程导致了结构的变化，这些变化反映在红外光谱中，从而实现了催化剂状态的实时监测。从聚集过程中观察到的红外吸收增强被归因于形成了更大的Pt颗粒，这表明颗粒大小影响了增强因子。这一发现对于优化催化剂性能特别重要，尤其是在选择性和稳定性的角度上。

综上所述，结合CO和H2化学吸附技术为了解双金属催化剂的结构-反应关系提供了全面的理解。通过监测结构变化、确定活性位点以及观察红外吸收增强，可以获得有关催化剂在异质催化中的机制的重要见解。

To compare CO and H2 chemisorption techniques in characterizing bimetallic catalysts, consider the following aspects:

1. Methodologies: Both CO and H2 are used for chemisorption to identify active sites on catalysts. CO is commonly used due to its strong affinity for metal surfaces, while H2 can be used to remove contaminants and induce surface reconstructions.

2. Applications: CO adsorption helps determine the nature of metal sites and their dispersion, while H2 can reveal the state of the catalyst surface and the extent of surface reconstruction.

3. Advantages: CO adsorption provides insights into the surface chemistry and metal functionality. H2-induced reconstructions can offer information about surface dynamics and mobility.

4. Limitations: CO adsorption might not detect all active sites, particularly those involved in less reversible reactions. H2 treatments can alter the catalyst's reactivity and stability.

5. Data Interpretation: Careful consideration is needed to distinguish between intrinsic properties of the catalyst and effects induced by the adsorbates. Normalization techniques can help account for changes in surface area and coverage.

6. Key Considerations: The choice between CO and H2 depends on the specific catalyst properties and the desired information. For instance, H2 might be preferred for studying surface mobility and reconstruction, while CO is better for identifying active sites.
