<p>The STM results show that the evaporated Pt thin films consist of particles forming a densely packed island structure. The nanometer thin Pt films do not completely cover the underneath Ge IRE (Al2O3 film). On the other hand, the 100 nm thick Al2O3 film does, as deduced from the complete absence of a Ge signal in the XPS.</p>
<p>XPS furthermore shows that the Pt is in the reduced state and that the d-valence bands exhibit the typical metallic features. From these morphological and electronic structure points of view the Pt thin films represent promising model systems for a supported Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>The films were stable in organic solvent and in the presence of dissolved O2, H2, and CO. Once exposed to air the freshly deposited Pt films were covered with a resistant contamination layer.</p>
<p>A TR-IR spectroscopy revealed the cleaning effect of dissolved O2 and H2. The most prominent effect was the removal of CO and carbonate species upon contact with H2-saturated solvent.</p>
<p>When H2-saturated solvent was admitted the Pt particles sintered at room temperature as shown by STM. This structural change was very fast and could be monitored by infrared spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule.</p>
<p>The observation that such a reconstruction occurs fast at the metalliquid interface indicates that the solvent is favorable for this process. Furthermore, reconstruction lead to enhanced infrared absorption.</p>

1. The STM analysis revealed that the evaporated Pt thin films have a particle-based island structure. These films, while not fully covering the Ge IRE (Al2O3 film), showed metallic characteristics as per the XPS results.
2. The Pt thin films were stable in organic solvents and under the presence of O2, H2, and CO. They developed a resistant contamination layer when exposed to air.
3. Attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) showed that O2 and H2 have a cleaning effect on the Pt films. Specifically, they remove CO and carbonate species when the solvent is saturated with H2.
4. Upon admission of H2-saturated solvent, the Pt particles underwent a sintering process at room temperature, as observed through STM. This was accompanied by enhanced infrared absorption, indicating a change in the film's morphology.
5. The findings suggest that the solvent promotes the sintering process and leads to enhanced infrared absorption, making the Pt/Al2O3 film a promising model system for investigating heterogeneous catalysis at the Pt-solvent interface.

1. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）分析表明，蒸发沉积的铂薄膜具有颗粒状的岛屿结构。这些薄膜虽然没有完全覆盖底层的Ge衬底（Al2O3薄膜），但在X射线光电子能谱（XPS）结果中显示出金属特性。
2. 这些铂薄膜在有机溶剂和存在O2、H2和CO的情况下表现出稳定性。它们在暴露于空气时形成了一层坚固的污染层。
3. 衰减全反射红外光谱（ATR-IR）显示，氧气和氢气对铂薄膜有清洁效果。具体而言，当溶剂饱和于H2时，它们会去除CO和碳酸盐分子。
4. 在引入H2饱和溶剂后，铂粒子在室温下经历了一个熔合过程，这一变化通过扫描隧道显微镜（STM）观察到。这一过程伴随着红外吸收增强，这表明薄膜的形态发生了变化。
5. 结果表明，溶剂促进了熔合过程并导致了红外吸收增强，使铂/Al2O3薄膜成为研究Pt-溶剂界面异相催化作用的理想模型系统。
