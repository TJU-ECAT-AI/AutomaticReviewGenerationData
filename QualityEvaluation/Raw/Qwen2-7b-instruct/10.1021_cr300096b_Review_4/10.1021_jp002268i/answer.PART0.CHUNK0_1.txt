The document describes a study on platinum (Pt) and platinum-alumina (Pt/Al2O3) thin films for investigating catalytic solid-liquid interfaces using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The films were evaporated on a Ge internal reflection element and characterized using various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and IR spectroscopy. The study monitored changes in the adsorbate layer of the Pt catalyst during cleaning with oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2). CO adsorption from CH2Cl2 was used as a probe to characterize the Pt catalyst in situ and to investigate the cleanliness of the Pt surface in the presence of a commercial organic solvent. The Pt/Al2O3 film showed a characteristic band at 2000 cm-1 in the CO adsorption spectrum, typical of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The origin of this effect was attributed to a structural change of the Pt particles induced by dissolved hydrogen, which was directly monitored using CO as a probe molecule. STM investigations revealed that the Pt particles sintered upon hydrogen treatment at room temperature, leading to a surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA).

该文档描述了一项关于在Ge内部反射元件上蒸发的铂（Pt）和铂氧化铝（Pt/Al2O3）薄膜的研究，用于研究固体-液体界面的催化作用。使用各种技术对薄膜进行了表征，包括X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、原子力显微镜（AFM）、扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和红外光谱。研究跟踪了在氧气（O2）和氢气（H2）清洁过程中Pt催化剂吸附层的变化。通过从CH2Cl2吸附CO作为探针，研究了Pt催化剂的原位特性，并调查了在商业有机溶剂存在的情况下Pt表面的清洁程度。Pt/Al2O3薄膜显示了与Pt/Al2O3催化剂典型的2000 cm-1波数的CO吸附谱带。这种效果的起源归因于溶解氢诱导的Pt颗粒结构变化，这种变化是通过使用CO作为探针分子直接监测的。STM研究表明，在室温下，通过氢处理后Pt颗粒发生聚集，导致表面增强红外吸收（SEIRA）。
