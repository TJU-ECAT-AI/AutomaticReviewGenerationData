How do CO and H2 chemisorption techniques compare in their effectiveness for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, including their respective methodologies, applications in determining active metal sites and metal dispersion, advantages, limitations, and key considerations for data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates?
</questions>

The provided scientific literature does not contain direct comparisons of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on the adsorbate-induced segregation of subsurface metal atoms in bimetallic surfaces, which is a different topic. Therefore, the literature does not provide relevant information to answer the comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques.
