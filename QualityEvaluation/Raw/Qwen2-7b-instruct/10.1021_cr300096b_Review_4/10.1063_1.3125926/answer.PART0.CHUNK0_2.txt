<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the general trend of adsorbate-induced segregation of subsurface metal atoms in bimetallic surfaces, which is relevant to understanding the behavior of these materials under chemisorption techniques such as CO and H2. It provides insights into how these techniques can be used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, determine active metal sites, and assess metal dispersion. However, the specific methodologies, applications, advantages, limitations, and considerations for data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates for CO and H2 chemisorption are not directly addressed in the provided literature.
