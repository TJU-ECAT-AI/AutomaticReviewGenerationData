<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses the adsorbate-induced segregation of subsurface metal atoms in bimetallic surfaces, focusing on CO and H2 chemisorption techniques as methods for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. These techniques are used to determine active metal sites and metal dispersion, which are crucial for understanding the functionality of bimetallic catalysts. Key considerations for interpreting data and normalizing reaction rates include the coverage dependence, the effect of the electronegativity of adsorbate species, and other factors that influence the performance of the catalysts.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the general trend of adsorbate-induced segregation of subsurface metal atoms in bimetallic surfaces, which is relevant to understanding the behavior of these materials under chemisorption techniques such as CO and H2. It provides insights into how these techniques can be used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, determine active metal sites, and assess metal dispersion. However, the specific methodologies, applications, advantages, limitations, and considerations for data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates for CO and H2 chemisorption are not directly addressed in the provided literature.

</questions>

The provided scientific literature does not contain direct comparisons of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on the adsorbate-induced segregation of subsurface metal atoms in bimetallic surfaces, which is a different topic. Therefore, the literature does not provide relevant information to answer the comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques.
