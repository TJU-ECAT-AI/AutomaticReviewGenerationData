The literature discusses the adsorbate-induced segregation of subsurface metal atoms in bimetallic surfaces, focusing on CO and H2 chemisorption techniques as methods for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. These techniques are used to determine active metal sites and metal dispersion, which are crucial for understanding the functionality of bimetallic catalysts. Key considerations for interpreting data and normalizing reaction rates include the coverage dependence, the effect of the electronegativity of adsorbate species, and other factors that influence the performance of the catalysts.
