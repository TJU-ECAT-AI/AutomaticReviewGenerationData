[1] "It was confirmed experimentally at PtFe bulk alloys that the alloy catalyst surface consists of a pure Pt skin-layer (B1 nm in thickness) that is modified in the electronic structure by that of the bulk alloy."
[2] "The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces."
[3] "The role of the morphology or crystallo- graphic changes and of the electronic structure change brought about by alloying, on the electrocatalysis of the orr still remains elusive."
[4] "We find a similar enhancement on PtNi alloys [18] and others."

The document discusses the electrocatalytic activity of PtFe alloys, showing a significant enhancement in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. The enhancement is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the Pt surface, specifically by the presence of 5d-vacancies. The document does not compare CO and H2 chemisorption techniques in terms of characterizing bimetallic catalysts, nor does it provide information on their methodologies, applications, advantages, limitations, or data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates.

文档讨论了PtFe合金的电催化活性，显示与纯Pt相比，在氧还原反应（ORR）中出现了显著增强。这种增强被归因于Pt表面电子结构的修改，特别是通过存在5d空位。文档没有比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征二元催化剂方面的性能，也没有提供它们的方法学、应用、优势、局限性或反应速率数据解释和归一化的信息。
