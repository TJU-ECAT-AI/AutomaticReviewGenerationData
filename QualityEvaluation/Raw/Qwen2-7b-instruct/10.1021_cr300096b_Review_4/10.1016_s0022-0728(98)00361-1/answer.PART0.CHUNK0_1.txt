[1] "The design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymerelectrolyte fuel cells, which are now attracting enormous interest as a primary power source for zero-emission electric vehicles."
[2] "It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpotential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e. ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt,which was maintained after all the electrochemical measurements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as that shown in the inset in Fig. 2."
[3] "A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient."
[4] "These chemical shifts of the core orbitals such as 4d3/2 and 4d5/2, which we observe here, show that the electronic structure changes in the skin Pt as well as in the Pt in the bulk alloy phase, and strongly suggests a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase of the valence electron (5d) vacancy."
[5] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

The enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of platinum (Pt) by alloying with iron (Fe) is significant, achieving a reduction of approximately 150 millivolts in overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. This enhancement factor reaches about 25 at a 50% Fe content and remains consistent at less positive potentials as long as sufficient oxygen supply is available. The electronic structure of the Pt surface layer modifies when alloyed with Fe, suggesting a decrease in the Fermi level or an increase in the valence electron (5d) vacancy. The enhancement effect might vary depending on the thickness of the Pt skin layer formed on the alloy surface, potentially decreasing with thicker layers.

铂（Pt）通过与铁（Fe）合金化实现电催化活性显著增强，氧还原反应（ORR）的过电势降低约150毫伏，相比于纯铂。在大约50%的Fe含量下，增强因子达到约25，并且在足够氧气供应的情况下，该效果在较低的正电势下保持一致。当铂表面层与Fe合金化时，电子结构会发生变化，这表明费米能级可能下降或价电子（5d）空位增加。增强效应可能随着形成在合金表面的铂皮层厚度的增加而变化，潜在地随着更厚的层减少。
