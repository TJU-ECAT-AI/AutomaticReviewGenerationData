<p>PEFCs will be operated under much easier conditions compared with those in PAFCs. Therefore, there is an opportunity to develop more active cathode catalysts and hence to reduce further the amount of precious metals used without losing performance from that of the present level.</p>
<p>It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpotential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e. ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt, which was maintained after all the electrochemical measurements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as that shown in the inset in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient.</p>
<p>Such a significant enhancement and the maxima have not been reported so far. Previously, an enhancement on fine Pt alloy particles in gas-diffusion electrodes was reported under PEFC operation conditions, but the factors were all small; for example, noticeable values among them were 1.4 and 2.6 for PtFe and PtCr alloys, respectively [7].</p>
<p>We have found that a fine Pt alloy catalyst is covered with a pure Pt skin under the practical operation conditions in PAFCs [8]. Although the present experimental conditions are much milder than those in PAFCs, the formation of a similar Pt skin layer could be predicted on PtFe alloys even under the present experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Positive chemical shifts of 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 from those of pure Pt indicated by dotted lines were observed, as shown in Fig. 3. Such positive chemical shifts of Pt atoms were observed at all of the alloys examined regardless of the composition, although the shifts decreased after the experiment.</p>
<p>No difference in the diffraction peaks was observed by grazing angle XRD at the samples before and after electrochemical experiments.</p>
<p>The surface compositions of various alloys before and after the electrochemical experiment are shown in Table 1, evaluated with Eq. (1) based on these XPS data.</p>

The document provides insights into the development of more active cathode catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEFCs) that can reduce the use of precious metals without compromising performance. It demonstrates a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity of platinum (Pt) when alloyed with iron (Fe), achieving a 25-fold increase in activity compared to pure Pt. This enhancement is observed at a 50% Fe content, and the activity remains constant across less positive potentials as long as the oxygen supply is sufficient. The study also reveals that fine Pt alloy catalysts are covered by a pure Pt skin layer under practical operating conditions, suggesting that similar layers can form on PtFe alloys under less severe conditions. Furthermore, the electronic structure of the Pt surface is modified by the presence of Fe, leading to a stronger interaction with oxygen molecules, which facilitates faster bond scission and/or new bond formation. This enhancement mechanism explains the improved catalytic performance observed in the PtFe alloy catalysts.

文档提供了开发用于质子交换膜燃料电池（PEFC）的更活跃阴极催化剂的方法，这些催化剂可以减少贵金属的使用，而不会影响性能。它展示了当铂（Pt）与铁（Fe）合金化时，电催化活性显著增强，与纯Pt相比，活性增加了25倍。这种增强发生在50%的Fe含量下，并且在氧气供应充足的情况下，活性在较低的正电位下保持不变。该研究还发现，细粒度的Pt合金催化剂在实际运行条件下被一层纯Pt层覆盖，这表明在较温和的条件下，类似的层也可以在PtFe合金上形成。此外，Pt表面的电子结构通过Fe的存在而改变，导致氧分子与Pt之间的更强相互作用，从而加速了键的断裂或新键的形成。这种增强机制解释了在PtFe合金催化剂中观察到的改善催化性能。

[5] "We can presumably explain the controversial enhancement effects reported by others in the following: the enhancement appears to be dramatically similar to the present work when the Pt skin is thin enough so that the electronic structure can be modified by that of the bulk alloy, but the extension of the modification to the electrode surface may be lowered by the presence of thicker skin-layers."

The enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of platinum (Pt) by alloying with iron (Fe) is significant, achieving a reduction of approximately 150 millivolts in overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. This enhancement factor reaches about 25 at a 50% Fe content and remains consistent at less positive potentials as long as sufficient oxygen supply is available. The electronic structure of the Pt surface layer modifies when alloyed with Fe, suggesting a decrease in the Fermi level or an increase in the valence electron (5d) vacancy. The enhancement effect might vary depending on the thickness of the Pt skin layer formed on the alloy surface, potentially decreasing with thicker layers.

铂（Pt）通过与铁（Fe）合金化实现电催化活性显著增强，氧还原反应（ORR）的过电势降低约150毫伏，相比于纯铂。在大约50%的Fe含量下，增强因子达到约25，并且在足够氧气供应的情况下，该效果在较低的正电势下保持一致。当铂表面层与Fe合金化时，电子结构会发生变化，这表明费米能级可能下降或价电子（5d）空位增加。增强效应可能随着形成在合金表面的铂皮层厚度的增加而变化，潜在地随着更厚的层减少。

The document discusses the electrocatalytic activity of PtFe alloys, showing a significant enhancement in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. The enhancement is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the Pt surface, specifically by the presence of 5d-vacancies. The document does not compare CO and H2 chemisorption techniques in terms of characterizing bimetallic catalysts, nor does it provide information on their methodologies, applications, advantages, limitations, or data interpretation and normalization of reaction rates.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of platinum (Pt) by alloying with iron (Fe) is significant, reaching up to 25 times higher than pure Pt activity at a 50% Fe content. The alloy catalyst surface contains a thin, pure Pt layer (approximately 1 nanometer thick) that modifies its electronic structure due to the bulk alloy's influence. The enhancement is attributed to the surface's 5d-vacancy rather than changes in the Pt interatomic distance or surface roughness. The role of the morphology or crystal structure changes brought about by alloying in electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains unclear. The maximum enhancement occurs at a 50% Fe content, resulting in a constant, enhanced performance across various electrochemical measurements. This finding is supported by the observation of positive chemical shifts in the 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 orbitals of the Pt atoms, indicating a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase in the valence electron vacancy. The alloy catalyst easily forms a Pt skin layer by exposing the surface to a potential up to 1.1 volts in dilute acid solution.

铂（Pt）通过与铁（Fe）合金化增强电催化活性显著，纯度达到25倍以上，50% Fe含量时达到最高。合金催化剂表面包含一个薄的纯Pt层（约1纳米厚），其电子结构由于基体合金的影响而发生改变。增强归因于表面的5d空位，而不是Pt原子间的距离或表面粗糙度的变化。合金化在电化学氧化还原反应（ORR）中的形态或晶体结构变化的作用仍然不明。最大增强发生在50% Fe含量时，导致各种电化学测量下的持续增强性能。这一发现得到了观察到的Pt原子的4d3/2和4d5/2轨道的正化学位移的支持，这表明费米能级的降低或价电子空位的增加。合金催化剂容易在稀酸溶液中通过将表面暴露至1.1伏特的电势形成Pt层。
