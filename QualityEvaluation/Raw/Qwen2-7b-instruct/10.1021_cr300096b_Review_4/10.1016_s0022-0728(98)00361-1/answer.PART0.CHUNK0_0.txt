<p>PEFCs will be operated under much easier conditions compared with those in PAFCs. Therefore, there is an opportunity to develop more active cathode catalysts and hence to reduce further the amount of precious metals used without losing performance from that of the present level.</p>
<p>It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpotential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e. ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt, which was maintained after all the electrochemical measurements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as that shown in the inset in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient.</p>
<p>Such a significant enhancement and the maxima have not been reported so far. Previously, an enhancement on fine Pt alloy particles in gas-diffusion electrodes was reported under PEFC operation conditions, but the factors were all small; for example, noticeable values among them were 1.4 and 2.6 for PtFe and PtCr alloys, respectively [7].</p>
<p>We have found that a fine Pt alloy catalyst is covered with a pure Pt skin under the practical operation conditions in PAFCs [8]. Although the present experimental conditions are much milder than those in PAFCs, the formation of a similar Pt skin layer could be predicted on PtFe alloys even under the present experimental conditions.</p>
<p>Positive chemical shifts of 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 from those of pure Pt indicated by dotted lines were observed, as shown in Fig. 3. Such positive chemical shifts of Pt atoms were observed at all of the alloys examined regardless of the composition, although the shifts decreased after the experiment.</p>
<p>No difference in the diffraction peaks was observed by grazing angle XRD at the samples before and after electrochemical experiments.</p>
<p>The surface compositions of various alloys before and after the electrochemical experiment are shown in Table 1, evaluated with Eq. (1) based on these XPS data.</p>

The document provides insights into the development of more active cathode catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEFCs) that can reduce the use of precious metals without compromising performance. It demonstrates a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity of platinum (Pt) when alloyed with iron (Fe), achieving a 25-fold increase in activity compared to pure Pt. This enhancement is observed at a 50% Fe content, and the activity remains constant across less positive potentials as long as the oxygen supply is sufficient. The study also reveals that fine Pt alloy catalysts are covered by a pure Pt skin layer under practical operating conditions, suggesting that similar layers can form on PtFe alloys under less severe conditions. Furthermore, the electronic structure of the Pt surface is modified by the presence of Fe, leading to a stronger interaction with oxygen molecules, which facilitates faster bond scission and/or new bond formation. This enhancement mechanism explains the improved catalytic performance observed in the PtFe alloy catalysts.

文档提供了开发用于质子交换膜燃料电池（PEFC）的更活跃阴极催化剂的方法，这些催化剂可以减少贵金属的使用，而不会影响性能。它展示了当铂（Pt）与铁（Fe）合金化时，电催化活性显著增强，与纯Pt相比，活性增加了25倍。这种增强发生在50%的Fe含量下，并且在氧气供应充足的情况下，活性在较低的正电位下保持不变。该研究还发现，细粒度的Pt合金催化剂在实际运行条件下被一层纯Pt层覆盖，这表明在较温和的条件下，类似的层也可以在PtFe合金上形成。此外，Pt表面的电子结构通过Fe的存在而改变，导致氧分子与Pt之间的更强相互作用，从而加速了键的断裂或新键的形成。这种增强机制解释了在PtFe合金催化剂中观察到的改善催化性能。
