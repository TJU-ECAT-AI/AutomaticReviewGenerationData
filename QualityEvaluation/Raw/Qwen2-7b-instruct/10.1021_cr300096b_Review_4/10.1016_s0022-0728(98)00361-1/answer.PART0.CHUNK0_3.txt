[1] "The design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymerelectrolyte fuel cells, which are now attracting enormous interest as a primary power source for zero-emission electric vehicles."
[2] "We have discovered a significant enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe, and found a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which results in 25 times higher activity than pure Pt activity."
[3] "The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces."
[4] "We find a similar enhancement on PtNi alloys [18] and others."

The document discusses the discovery of a significant enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of platinum (Pt) when alloyed with iron (Fe), with the maximum activity occurring at approximately 50% Fe content. This results in 25 times higher activity than pure Pt. The enhancement is attributed to the 5d-vacancy of the surface, rather than changes in Pt interatomic distance or surface roughness. The study also mentions finding a similar enhancement on PtNi alloys.

该文献讨论了铂（Pt）与铁（Fe）合金化时显著增强的电催化活性的发现，最大活性发生在大约50%Fe含量。这导致了25倍高于纯Pt的活性。增强归因于表面的5d空位，而不是Pt原子间距离或表面粗糙度的变化。研究还提到在PtNi合金上也发现了类似的增强。
