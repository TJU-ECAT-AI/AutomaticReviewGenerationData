[1] "We have discovered a significant enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Pt by alloying with Fe, and found a maximum activity at ca. 50% Fe content, which results in 25 times higher activity than pure Pt activity."
[2] "It was confirmed experimentally at PtFe bulk alloys that the alloy catalyst surface consists of a pure Pt skin-layer (B1 nm in thickness) that is modified in the electronic structure by that of the bulk alloy."
[3] "The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces."
[4] "As seen above, the role of the morphology or crystallo- graphic changes and of the electronic structure change brought about by alloying, on the electrocatalysis of the orr still remains elusive."
[5] "The jk was determined for each electrode at constant potential in the manner described in the experimental section. A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient."
[6] "The extremely large enhancement is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."
[7] "Positive chemical shifts of 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 from those of pure Pt indicated by dotted lines were observed, as shown in Fig. 3."
[8] "This is clear evidence that the alloy catalyst easily forms a Pt skin layer by exposing the surface to a potential up to 1.1 V even in dilute acid solution."

The enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of platinum (Pt) by alloying with iron (Fe) is significant, reaching up to 25 times higher than pure Pt activity at a 50% Fe content. The alloy catalyst surface contains a thin, pure Pt layer (approximately 1 nanometer thick) that modifies its electronic structure due to the bulk alloy's influence. The enhancement is attributed to the surface's 5d-vacancy rather than changes in the Pt interatomic distance or surface roughness. The role of the morphology or crystal structure changes brought about by alloying in electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains unclear. The maximum enhancement occurs at a 50% Fe content, resulting in a constant, enhanced performance across various electrochemical measurements. This finding is supported by the observation of positive chemical shifts in the 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 orbitals of the Pt atoms, indicating a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase in the valence electron vacancy. The alloy catalyst easily forms a Pt skin layer by exposing the surface to a potential up to 1.1 volts in dilute acid solution.

铂（Pt）通过与铁（Fe）合金化增强电催化活性显著，纯度达到25倍以上，50% Fe含量时达到最高。合金催化剂表面包含一个薄的纯Pt层（约1纳米厚），其电子结构由于基体合金的影响而发生改变。增强归因于表面的5d空位，而不是Pt原子间的距离或表面粗糙度的变化。合金化在电化学氧化还原反应（ORR）中的形态或晶体结构变化的作用仍然不明。最大增强发生在50% Fe含量时，导致各种电化学测量下的持续增强性能。这一发现得到了观察到的Pt原子的4d3/2和4d5/2轨道的正化学位移的支持，这表明费米能级的降低或价电子空位的增加。合金催化剂容易在稀酸溶液中通过将表面暴露至1.1伏特的电势形成Pt层。
