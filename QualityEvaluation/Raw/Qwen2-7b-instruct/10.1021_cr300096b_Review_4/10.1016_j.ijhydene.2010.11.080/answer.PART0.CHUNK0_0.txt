[1] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[2] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[3] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[4] "The changes in the catalysts activity and stability under the presence of an additional oxygen source were determined through addition of small amounts of either oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream."
[5] "Results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

The catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples is significantly influenced by the metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. Catalysts with a low Ni/Pt ratio, specifically 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, demonstrated the highest catalytic activity and stability. This is due to the easy reduction of nickel oxide species and the formation of smaller, well-dispersed nano-sized nickel particles, which result from the close interaction between platinum and nickel sites. The presence of an additional oxygen source, either in the form of oxygen or water vapor, affects the catalyst's activity and stability. The observed changes in activity and stability suggest that the surface reaction mechanism varies depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts.

铂镍双金属催化剂的催化性能主要取决于金属负载和镍/铂负载比。镍/铂比例较低的催化剂，例如0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3，显示出最高的催化活性和稳定性。这归因于镍氧化物物种的易于还原以及形成更小、分布更均匀的纳米级镍颗粒，这些颗粒是由于铂和镍位点之间的紧密相互作用造成的。额外氧气源的存在，无论是以氧气还是水蒸气的形式添加到进料流中，都会影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。观察到的活性和稳定性的变化表明，表面反应机制取决于催化剂中的铂载荷和镍/铂比。
