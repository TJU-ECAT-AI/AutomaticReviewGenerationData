[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."
[2] "Selected catalyst samples, before and after reaction, were characterized by XRD, XPS, TGA/DTA and SEM-EDS."
[3] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[4] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[5] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[6] "The changes in the catalysts activity and stability under the presence of an additional oxygen source were determined through addition of small amounts of either oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream."
[7] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."
[8] "0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."

CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are both utilized for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, particularly in determining active metal sites and metal dispersion. CO chemisorption is often employed to assess the surface area and metal coverage of the catalyst, whereas H2 chemisorption helps in understanding the reactivity of the active sites. Both methods are crucial for interpreting the data and normalizing reaction rates. However, they have distinct methodologies, applications, advantages, and limitations. CO chemisorption is more sensitive to small changes in metal surface coverage, while H2 chemisorption can provide insights into the hydrogenation properties of the catalyst. Key considerations for data interpretation include accounting for adsorption isotherms, temperature effects, and the influence of different gases on the surface chemistry of the catalyst.

Answer: CO和H2化学吸附技术都用于表征双金属催化剂，特别是在确定活性金属位点和金属分散度方面。CO化学吸附常用于评估催化剂的表面面积和金属覆盖度，而H2化学吸附有助于了解活性位点的反应性。这两种方法对于解读数据和标准化反应速率至关重要。然而，它们在方法、应用、优势和局限性上有所不同。CO化学吸附更敏感于金属表面覆盖度的小变化，而H2化学吸附可以提供催化剂氢化性质的见解。数据解释的关键考虑因素包括考虑吸附等温线、温度效应以及不同气体对催化剂表面化学的影响。
