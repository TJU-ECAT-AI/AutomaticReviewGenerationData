[1] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[2] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[3] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[4] "The changes in the catalysts activity and stability under the presence of an additional oxygen source were determined through addition of small amounts of either oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream."
[5] "Results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."

The catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples is significantly influenced by the metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. Catalysts with a low Ni/Pt ratio, specifically 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, demonstrated the highest catalytic activity and stability. This is due to the easy reduction of nickel oxide species and the formation of smaller, well-dispersed nano-sized nickel particles, which result from the close interaction between platinum and nickel sites. The presence of an additional oxygen source, either in the form of oxygen or water vapor, affects the catalyst's activity and stability. The observed changes in activity and stability suggest that the surface reaction mechanism varies depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts.

铂镍双金属催化剂的催化性能主要取决于金属负载和镍/铂负载比。镍/铂比例较低的催化剂，例如0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3，显示出最高的催化活性和稳定性。这归因于镍氧化物物种的易于还原以及形成更小、分布更均匀的纳米级镍颗粒，这些颗粒是由于铂和镍位点之间的紧密相互作用造成的。额外氧气源的存在，无论是以氧气还是水蒸气的形式添加到进料流中，都会影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。观察到的活性和稳定性的变化表明，表面反应机制取决于催化剂中的铂载荷和镍/铂比。

CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are both utilized for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, particularly in determining active metal sites and metal dispersion. CO chemisorption is often employed to assess the surface area and metal coverage of the catalyst, whereas H2 chemisorption helps in understanding the reactivity of the active sites. Both methods are crucial for interpreting the data and normalizing reaction rates. However, they have distinct methodologies, applications, advantages, and limitations. CO chemisorption is more sensitive to small changes in metal surface coverage, while H2 chemisorption can provide insights into the hydrogenation properties of the catalyst. Key considerations for data interpretation include accounting for adsorption isotherms, temperature effects, and the influence of different gases on the surface chemistry of the catalyst.

Answer: CO和H2化学吸附技术都用于表征双金属催化剂，特别是在确定活性金属位点和金属分散度方面。CO化学吸附常用于评估催化剂的表面面积和金属覆盖度，而H2化学吸附有助于了解活性位点的反应性。这两种方法对于解读数据和标准化反应速率至关重要。然而，它们在方法、应用、优势和局限性上有所不同。CO化学吸附更敏感于金属表面覆盖度的小变化，而H2化学吸附可以提供催化剂氢化性质的见解。数据解释的关键考虑因素包括考虑吸附等温线、温度效应以及不同气体对催化剂表面化学的影响。

The CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, specifically in the context of CO2 reforming of methane. These techniques help determine active metal sites and metal dispersion. XRD, XPS, TGA/DTA, and SEM-EDS are employed to analyze the catalysts before and after reactions. The catalytic performance significantly depends on metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. The 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability due to its low Ni/Pt ratio, leading to easier reduction of NiO species and better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites. The presence of an additional oxygen source affects the catalyst's activity and stability, with changes in surface reaction mechanisms observed based on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio. The 0.3Pt10Ni catalyst remains stable under various feed conditions, making it promising for synthesis gas production in gas-to-liquid technology.
