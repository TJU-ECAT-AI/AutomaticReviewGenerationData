[1] "Selected catalyst samples, before and after reaction, were characterized by XRD, XPS, TGA/DTA and SEM-EDS."
[2] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."
[3] "Low Ni/Pt molar loading ratio of 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 sample led to a relatively easy reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller nano-sized nickel particles having better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites in the closed vicinity."
[4] "0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest activity & stability."

The document describes the use of various characterization techniques such as XRD, XPS, TGA/DTA, and SEM-EDS to analyze the state of catalyst samples before and after reaction. It also discusses how the surface reaction mechanism changes based on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts. It further explains that a lower Ni/Pt molar ratio leads to easier reduction of nickel oxide species and smaller, more dispersed nickel particles due to the close interaction between Pt and Ni sites. Lastly, it states that the 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated the highest activity and stability.

文档描述了使用诸如XRD、XPS、TGA/DTA和SEM-EDS等表征技术来分析反应前后催化剂样品的状态。它还讨论了表面反应机制如何根据催化剂中Pt负载和Ni/Pt比例的变化而改变。它进一步解释说，较低的Ni/Pt摩尔比导致镍氧化物种更易还原，并且具有更小、分散度更好的镍颗粒，这是由于Pt和Ni位点在封闭附近的密切相互作用造成的。最后，它指出0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3催化剂显示出最高的活性和稳定性。
