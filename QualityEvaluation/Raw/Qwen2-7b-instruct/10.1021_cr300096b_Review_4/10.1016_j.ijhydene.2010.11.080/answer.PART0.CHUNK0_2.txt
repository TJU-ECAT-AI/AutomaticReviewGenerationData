[1] "A series of PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on δ-Al2O3 to be used in carbon dioxide reforming of methane was prepared and tested with the objective of optimizing the Ni/Pt metal composition to obtain high activity and stability."
[2] "Selected catalyst samples, before and after reaction, were characterized by XRD, XPS, TGA/DTA and SEM-EDS."
[3] "The activity results showed that the catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi samples strongly depended on the metal loadings and Ni/Pt loading ratio."
[4] "Among all the catalysts, 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3, which has the lowest Ni/Pt ratio, exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability."
[5] "The changes in the catalysts activity and stability under the presence of an additional oxygen source were determined through addition of small amounts of either oxygen or water vapor to the feed stream."
[6] "The results of the combined dry reforming and partial oxidation tests strongly indicated a change in surface reaction mechanism depending on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio of the catalysts."
[7] "0.3Pt10Ni was capable of operating under a variety of feed conditions without significant deactivation suggesting that the catalyst is very promising for synthesis gas production for gas-to-liquid technology."

The CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are used to characterize bimetallic catalysts, specifically in the context of CO2 reforming of methane. These techniques help determine active metal sites and metal dispersion. XRD, XPS, TGA/DTA, and SEM-EDS are employed to analyze the catalysts before and after reactions. The catalytic performance significantly depends on metal loadings and the Ni/Pt loading ratio. The 0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest activity and stability due to its low Ni/Pt ratio, leading to easier reduction of NiO species and better dispersion caused by the intimate interaction between Pt and Ni sites. The presence of an additional oxygen source affects the catalyst's activity and stability, with changes in surface reaction mechanisms observed based on the Pt load and Ni/Pt ratio. The 0.3Pt10Ni catalyst remains stable under various feed conditions, making it promising for synthesis gas production in gas-to-liquid technology.

CO和H2化学吸附技术用于表征双金属催化剂，特别是二氧化碳重整甲烷的过程。这些技术有助于确定活性金属位点和金属分散度。XRD、XPS、TGA/DTA和SEM-EDS被用来分析反应前后催化剂。催化性能主要取决于金属负载和Ni/Pt负载比。0.3%Pt10%Ni/Al2O3催化剂表现出最高的活性和稳定性，其低Ni/Pt比率导致NiO物种的容易还原以及由Pt和Ni位点之间的紧密相互作用引起的更好的分散性。额外氧气源的存在影响催化剂的活性和稳定性，表面反应机制的变化基于催化剂的Pt负载和Ni/Pt比率。0.3Pt10Ni催化剂在各种进料条件下保持稳定，使其在气到液体技术中合成气体生产方面具有很高的潜力。
