The document does not contain information about how CO and H2 chemisorption techniques compare in their effectiveness for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on other topics such as the thermal conductivity of liquid methane, cationic motions and phase transitions in solid complexes, and scaling theory for thermal explosion conditions.
