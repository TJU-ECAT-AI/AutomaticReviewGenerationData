[1] "Experiments were performed in a three-level UHV chamber as described earlier [33]."
[2] "The Pt(1 1 1) crystal (Atomergic; 10 mm diameter, 1.5 mm thick) was prepared by 1-keV Ar+-ion sputtering and oxygen treatment (5 × 107 Torr O2, 900 K, 2 min) to give a clean spectrum using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a sharp (1 × 1) pattern in low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[3] "The NO2 coverage scale was determined by calibration using the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 TPD peak areas after NO2 adsorption on clean Pt(1 1 1), assuming that 20% of the 0.5-ML NO2 coverage desorbs as NO2 and the rest decomposes cleanly to NO and O2 during TPD as reported by Bartram et al."
[4] "After annealing to 900 K, which desorbs some oxygen from the surface, some small loss features due to SnO modes still remain, but these are eliminated by heating to 1100 K."

1. The experiments took place in a three-level ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber, as described in a previous reference.
2. The Pt(1 1 1) crystal was prepared using 1-keV Ar+ ion sputtering followed by oxygen treatment at 900 K for 2 minutes under an oxygen pressure of 5 × 10^7 Torr. This resulted in a clean surface as confirmed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a clear (1 × 1) pattern in low energy electron diffraction (LEED).
3. The scale for NO2 coverage was established by calibrating against the total areas of the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 thermodesorption (TD) peaks after NO2 adsorption on a clean Pt(1 1 1) surface. It was assumed that 20% of the NO2 molecules desorb as NO2, while the rest decompose into NO and O2 during TD, according to Bartram et al.'s findings.
4. Upon annealing the sample to 900 K, some oxygen was removed from the surface. However, residual features related to tin oxide (SnO) remained after annealing. These were eliminated by further heating the surface to 1100 K.

1. 实验在三层超高真空（UHV）室中进行，具体细节见先前的引用。
2. Pt(1 1 1)单晶通过1 keV Ar+离子溅射和在900 K下用氧气处理2分钟制备。氧气压力为5×10^7托。这导致表面清洁，通过阿格尔电子能谱（AES）和低能电子衍射（LEED）的清晰（1×1）模式确认。
3. NO2覆盖度的尺度通过将NO2吸附在干净的Pt(1 1 1)表面后NO2、NO和O2热脱附（TD）峰的总面积进行校准建立起来。假设20%的NO2分子以NO2的形式脱附，其余则在TD过程中分解成NO和O2，参考Bartram等人的研究结果。
4. 对样品进行900 K的退火后，从表面上脱附了一些氧。但是，在退火到1100 K之后，残留的与SnO相关的特征消失。
