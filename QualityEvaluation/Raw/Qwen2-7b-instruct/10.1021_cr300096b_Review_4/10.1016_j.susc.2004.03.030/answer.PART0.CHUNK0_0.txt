[1] "Experiments were performed in a three-level UHV chamber as described earlier [33]."
[2] "The Pt(1 1 1) crystal (Atomergic; 10 mm diameter, 1.5 mm thick) was prepared by 1-keV Ar+-ion sputtering and oxygen treatment (5 × 107 Torr O2, 900 K, 2 min) to give a clean spectrum using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a sharp (1 × 1) pattern in low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[3] "This can be compared to the decomposition of about 80% of the monolayer on Pt(1 1 1) [5]."
[4] "The latter observation guarantees that NO:NO2 is 1:1 and O2: NO2 is 1:2."
[5] "The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML."
[6] "After annealing to 700 K, the peak shifts 1.5 to 425.1 eV KE. This indicates oxidation of Sn."
[7] "On the 3 alloy, the lower KE Sn(MNN) peak is located at 426.6 eV, identical to the value for Sn metal [41]."
[8] "The 1200 K anneal also caused the intensity of the Sn peak to decrease and the LEED pattern to change to a superposition of (2 × 2) and 3 spots."
[9] "This is a very different spectrum than that obtained for the μ-N,O-nitrito surface species, a chemisorbed NO2 species bonded to the surface through both of the N and O atoms, formed on Pt(1 1 1) [5], the N-bonded chemisorbed NO2 species formed on oxygen-precovered Pt(1 1 1) [45], and the O,O-chelating surface species, a chemisorbed NO2 species bonded to the surface through both of O atoms, formed on Au(1 1 1) [17]."
[10] "Annealing to 500 K removes all chemisorbed molecular species and only a broad feature centered at 536 cm1 was observed."

1. Experiments were conducted in a three-tier ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber, as described previously.
2. The Pt(1 1 1) crystal was prepared using 1 keV Ar+ ion sputtering and oxygen treatment at 900 K for 2 minutes, ensuring a clean surface as confirmed by AES and a (1 × 1) pattern in LEED.
3. The monolayer decomposition on the (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy was compared to about 80% on Pt(1 1 1) as reported earlier.
4. The NO:NO2 ratio was found to be 1:1 and O2: NO2 was 1:2 after the experiment.
5. The maximum oxygen coverage achieved by heating the N2O4 monolayer was approximately 0.4 ML.
6. Annealing to 700 K caused a shift in the Sn(MNN) peak from 426.6 eV to 425.1 eV, indicating the oxidation of Sn.
7. On the (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) alloy, the lower KE Sn(MNN) peak was at 426.6 eV, matching the value for Sn metal.
8. The 1200 K anneal reduced the Sn peak intensity and altered the LEED pattern to a superposition of (2 × 2) and 3 spots.
9. The obtained spectrum was markedly different from those obtained for chemisorbed NO2 species bonded to the surface through both N and O atoms on Pt(1 1 1), N-bonded chemisorbed NO2 species on oxygen-precovered Pt(1 1 1), and O,O-chelating surface species on Au(1 1 1).
10. Annealing to 500 K resulted in the removal of all chemisorbed molecular species, leaving only a broad feature centered at 536 cm1.

1. 实验在三级超高真空（UHV）室中进行，具体方法如前所述。
2. Pt(1 1 1)晶体通过1 keV Ar+离子溅射和在900 K下处理2分钟的氧气，确保表面清洁，并通过AES和LEED的（1 × 1）模式验证了这一点。
3. （3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的单层分解与在Pt(1 1 1)上观察到的大约80%进行了比较。
4. NO:NO2的比例为1:1，O2: NO2为1:2，实验后发现如此。
5. 加热N2O4单层后获得的最大氧覆盖度约为0.4 ML。
6. 在700 K下退火导致Sn(MNN)峰从426.6 eV移动到425.1 eV，表明Sn被氧化。
7. 对于（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1）合金，较低的KE Sn(MNN)峰位于426.6 eV，与Sn金属值相同。
8. 在1200 K下退火减少了Sn峰值强度，并改变了LEED图案为（2 × 2）和3个点的叠加。
9. 所获得的光谱与在Pt(1 1 1)上形成的通过N和O原子连接到表面的化学吸附NO2物种、氧预覆盖的Pt(1 1 1)上形成的N键合的化学吸附NO2物种以及Au(1 1 1)上形成的O,O螯合表面物种所获得的光谱明显不同。
10. 500 K下退火导致所有化学吸附分子物种的去除，仅留下中心为536 cm1的宽特征。
