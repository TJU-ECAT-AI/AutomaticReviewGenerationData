[1] "Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry."
[3] "However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state."
[4] "The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface."
[5] "Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K."
[6] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."
[7] "Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation."
[8] "Previously, Bartram, et al. used temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to study NO2 adsorption on Pt(1 1 1)."
[9] "At 100 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly at all coverages to form a Pt(1 1 1) μ-N,O-nitrito surface complex with Cs symmetry."
[10] "The saturation coverage of chemisorbed NO2 is about 0.5 monolayers (ML) at 100 K."
[11] "At low coverages, θNO2<0.25 ML, adsorption is irreversible and NO2 dissociates completely by 285 K to O atoms and nitric oxide (NO)."
[12] "At larger NO2 coverages, the adsorption is partially reversible and NO2 desorbs molecularly with first-order kinetics and Ea=19 kcal/mol."
[13] "About 20% of the NO2 desorbs reversibly at saturation coverage in the monolayer."
[14] "Platinumtin bimetallic catalysts are of interest for selective oxidation and reduction reactions, and are commercially important for petroleum reforming."
[15] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."
[16] "Surface science model studies have addressed the effect of alloying Sn with Pt on hydrocarbon surface chemistry."
[17] "Industrial, supported, PtSn catalysts, however, include an oxide support material and are complicated materials systems for which it is difficult to assess the phases present and the catalytic activity of each phase."
[18] "Specifically, the effect of tin oxidation on the kinetics of CO oxidation by O2 on an α-Al2O3 supported, PtSn catalyst has been studied by Grass and Lintz."
[19] "Of intense, additional interest, Pt-promoted SnO2 thin films are used widely in sensor technologies, for example, in detection of ethanol [30] and CO [31]."
[20] "These sensor systems are also complicated materials systems that could benefit greatly by surface science model studies that address the surface chemistry of PtSn alloys and elucidate additional molecular-level information on the interaction of gases with these surfaces."
