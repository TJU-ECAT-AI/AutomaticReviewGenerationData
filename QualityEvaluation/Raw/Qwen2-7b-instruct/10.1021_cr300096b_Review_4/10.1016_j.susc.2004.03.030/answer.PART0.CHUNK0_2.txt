The adsorption of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy was studied using various techniques. At 120 K, NO2 forms a N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, which adsorbs on the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted configuration. This dimer does not dissociate and no molecular desorption occurs. Upon heating to 300 K, the dimer dissociates, releasing NO2, NO, and O. Further heating to 300-400 K causes the adsorbed NO2 to dissociate into NO and O. The maximum oxygen coverage reached by heating the N2O4 monolayer was approximately 0.4 ML. Increasing the NO2 dosing at 600 K removes inhibition by coadsorbed NO, allowing the oxygen coverage to reach up to 1.1 ML. Heating to 900 K leaves 0.2 ML of oxygen associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to Sn1.5O. Oxygen desorption occurs in three clear states, primarily from Pt sites and from the decomposition of reduced tin oxide phases. AES peaks were used to monitor Sn oxidation.

对（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) 表面合金上NO2的吸附进行了研究，使用了多种技术。在120 K时，NO2以N,N共价键二聚体N2O4的形式吸附到表面，并通过单个氧原子呈直立但倾斜的几何形状与表面相互作用。该二聚体不会分解，也没有分子级的脱附。加热至300 K时，二聚体分解，释放出NO2、NO和O。进一步加热至300-400 K时，吸附的NO2分解为NO和O。加热N2O4单层至900 K后，表面留有约0.2 ML的氧，对应于Sn1.5O。氧气脱附发生在三个清晰的状态中，主要从Pt位点以及从还原锡氧化物相的分解中脱附。通过AES峰监测到了Sn的氧化。
