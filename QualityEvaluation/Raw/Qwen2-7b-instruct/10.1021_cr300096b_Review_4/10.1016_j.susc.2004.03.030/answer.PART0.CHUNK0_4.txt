3.1. TPD
Fig. 1 shows NO2 desorption traces obtained by monitoring the 46-amu signal. A single desorption peak appears below 150 K which increased in temperature with increasing coverage. This peak corresponds to desorption of NO2 from multilayer, physisorbed species and occurs at the same temperature as that for Pt(1 1 1) [5] . However, unlike the case on Pt(1 1 1), no NO2 desorbs from the chemisorbed monolayer. The NO2 monolayer reacts completely and irreversibly on a 3 alloy surface.

Fig. 2 traces the evolution of one of the reaction products, NO, after increasing NO2 exposures. The lowest exposure investigated yields three desorption peaks at 240, 280, and 360 K. After increasing NO2 exposures, these NO desorption peaks saturate in size and shift to higher temperature. Desorption of NO under most of these conditions is reaction rate-limited, because NO desorption following NO adsorption on a 3 alloy occurs in a single peak which shifts with coverage from 240 to 190 K [36] .

Fig. 3 shows corresponding O2 TPD spectra obtained during the same experiments. After a small initial NO2 dose, O2 desorption occurred at 1070 K in a peak that shifts to 1077 K at saturation. Following saturation of the high temperature peak, a second feature appeared at lower temperature with a broad peak at 910 K after large exposures. Based on previous studies of O2 desorption following O3 decomposition on PtSn alloys [37] , we can assign these two peaks to decomposition of Sn-oxide species.

Fig. 4 utilizes the TPD areas from Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 to construct an uptake plot characterizing the adsorption kinetics and decomposition reactions during TPD. 

Fig. 5 demonstrates that the oxygen coverage can be increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures. The surface oxygen coverage obtained following exposures at 120 K is limited by coadsorbed NO. The bottom curve in Fig. 5 reproduces the top curve from Fig. 3 . The top curve in Fig. 5 is after a higher NO2 exposure on the alloy at 600 K, which is above the desorption temperature of NO but below that required for O2 desorption.

Fig. 6 shows the shift in the Sn(MNN) AES peaks after exposures of 0.1-L NO2 on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the surface to gradually desorb O2.

Fig. 7 shows HREELS spectra following deposition of a multilayer film of NO2 (6 layers, θNO2=2.4 ML) on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the sample to increasing temperatures.

Table 1 provides results for other N2O4 monolayers identified on graphite [44] and oxygen-precovered Au(1 1 1) [45] surfaces.

In the study of NO2 adsorption on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy, NO2 forms an N2O4 dimer in a monolayer state. This dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. The NO2 monolayer does not desorb molecularly and undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. The dimer's dissociation leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and the oxidation of Sn in the alloy at higher temperatures. Oxygen coverage can be increased by exposing the surface to NO2 at higher temperatures, reaching a maximum of θO=1.1 ML under certain conditions. The oxygen coverage is associated with oxidized Sn species, forming a film with a stoichiometry of Sn1.5O.

在对（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上NO2吸附的研究中，NO2形成一个N2O4二聚体，在单层状态。该二聚体通过单个氧原子与表面以直立但倾斜的几何结构相互作用。NO2单层不会分子地脱附，并在220至300 K之间完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。二聚体的分解导致表面氧的释放和合金中的Sn氧化。在较高温度下暴露表面，可以增加氧覆盖度，达到最大值θO=1.1 ML。氧覆盖度与合金中氧化的Sn物种相关联，形成Sn1.5O的薄膜。
