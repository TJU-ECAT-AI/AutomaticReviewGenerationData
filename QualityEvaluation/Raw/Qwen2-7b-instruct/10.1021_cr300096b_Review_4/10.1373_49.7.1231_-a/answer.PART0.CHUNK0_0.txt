[1] "This relatively short book is crammed with useful tips and pointers for users of this powerful spectroscopic technique."
[2] "The book is organized into seven chapters, with an extensive list of literature references at the end."
[3] "Organization of the text is logical, moving from a general overview, theory, and background to method development (chapter 4), routine analysis (chapter 5), and the very valuable Trouble-Shooting and Maintenance (chapter 6)."
[4] "Numerous specific applications are described in some detail, and original research manuscripts or government protocols (e.g., USEPA) are referenced."
[5] "The most useful and unique feature of the book was the inclusion of complementary information, listed with identifying symbols as practical tips, additional information, and complementary theory."
[6] "One might be reminded of the Dummies series of books, which use a similar system for adding ancillary or explanatory materials."
[7] "The authors many years of practice and teaching of this useful technique are clearly evident in the style and clarity of presentation."
[8] "All in all, this book should find its way to the laboratory bookshelf and be in constant use by practitioners."
