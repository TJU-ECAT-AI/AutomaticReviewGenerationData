[1] "This relatively short book is crammed with useful tips and pointers for users of this powerful spectroscopic technique."
[2] "Organization of the text is logical,moving from a general overview,theory, and background to method development (chapter 4),routine analysis (chapter 5), and the very valuable Trouble-Shooting and Maintenance (chapter 6)."
[3] "The book is generally well written and should be accessible to those who have not had either quantum mechanics or spectroscopy in a previous course."
[4] "The ordering of chapters may be confusing at first. First are several chapters on the quantum mechanical treatments of electronic, vibrational, and rotational behavior, which are followed by a short chapter on how spectra are measured."
[5] "Finally, the book has several example questions posed and answered throughout the chapters, as well as a few exercises to work out at the end of each chapter."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The book provides a wealth of practical advice and guidance for users of spectroscopic techniques, with a logical structure that progresses from theory to application. It is written accessibly, even for those without prior knowledge of quantum mechanics or spectroscopy. However, the organization of the chapters can initially be confusing, with quantum mechanical treatments preceding discussions on measurement methods. Each chapter includes examples and exercises to aid learning.
