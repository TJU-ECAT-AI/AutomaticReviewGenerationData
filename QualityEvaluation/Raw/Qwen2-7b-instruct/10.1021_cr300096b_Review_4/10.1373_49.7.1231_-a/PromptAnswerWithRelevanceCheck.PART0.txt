[3] "The book is generally well written and should be accessible to those who have not had either quantum mechanics or spectroscopy in a previous course."
[4] "The ordering of chapters may be confusing at first. First are several chapters on the quantum mechanical treatments of electronic, vibrational, and rotational behavior, which are followed by a short chapter on how spectra are measured."
[5] "Finally, the book has several example questions posed and answered throughout the chapters, as well as a few exercises to work out at the end of each chapter."
