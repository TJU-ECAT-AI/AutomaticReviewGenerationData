[1] "In this study, tin and gallium promoted Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by reductive deposition precipitation (RDP, i.e. deposition under hydrogen atmosphere) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)."
[2] "The hydrogen chemisorption results are also summarized in Table 3 and expressed as H/Pt ratio."
[3] "For reasons of comparison, a reference material was prepared by impregnation and treatment of SnCl4 on CNF at 473 K in H2/N2 flow, referred to as SnCl4/CNF."
[4] "From Fig. 10 and Table 5 it can be seen that at low pressure, catalysts prepared via RDP are more selective and active compared to the monometallic catalyst."
[5] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques were utilized to assess bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption measures the adsorption of carbon monoxide molecules, providing insights into the surface area and metal dispersion. H2 chemisorption quantifies the availability of hydrogenation sites, indicating the surface reactivity. Both methods offer valuable data on active sites and metal dispersion, but their effectiveness depends on the specific catalyst and the targeted reaction mechanism. CO chemisorption tends to correlate better with CO hydrogenation reactions, whereas H2 chemisorption is more indicative of hydrogenation capabilities in general. Normalization of data typically involves comparing the adsorbed species to the metal loading or the total surface area.

2. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques differ in their methodologies and applications. CO chemisorption is primarily employed for understanding surface reactions involving carbon-containing species, such as CO, CO2, and hydrocarbons. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, is more broadly used to evaluate the hydrogenation capability of catalysts, applicable across various reactions requiring hydrogen. Key considerations for interpreting data include reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), catalyst preparation methods, and the specific properties of interest (surface reactivity, selectivity).

3. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques offer distinct advantages and limitations. CO chemisorption provides precise information on the surface reactivity and dispersion of metals, particularly for reactions involving carbon species. However, it may not fully capture the hydrogenation capabilities of catalysts. Conversely, H2 chemisorption effectively evaluates hydrogenation potential but may not elucidate the specific mechanisms involved in carbon-based reactions. Normalization of data ensures comparability across different catalysts and experimental setups.

4. The selectivity enhancement observed with RDP synthesized catalysts is attributed to the close contact between platinum and the promoter, leading to improved hydrogenation selectivity. The RDP technique enables a better interaction between the metals, facilitating more efficient hydrogenation processes. This contrasts with IWI synthesis, where the lack of close interaction results in lower selectivity.

5. The variation in activity observed between different conditions is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and catalyst preparation methods. The RDP technique, through promoting a close interaction between platinum and the promoter, can shift the optimal conditions for activity, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing catalytic performance under varying conditions.

1.CO和H2化学吸附技术被用来评估双金属催化剂。CO吸附测量了碳氧化合物分子的吸附，提供了表面积和金属分散的信息。H2吸附量化了氢化位点的吸附，表明表面反应性。这两种方法在活性位点和金属分散方面提供了有价值的资料，但它们的有效性取决于特定催化剂和目标反应机制。CO吸附通常与涉及碳的反应（如CO、CO2和烃类）更相关，而H2吸附则更多地指示了氢化的潜在能力，适用于各种需要氢气的反应。数据归一化通常涉及将吸附的物种与金属负载或总面积进行比较。

2.CO和H2化学吸附技术在方法论和应用上存在差异。CO吸附主要用于理解涉及碳基物种（如CO、CO2和烃类）的表面反应。H2吸附则更广泛地用于评估催化剂的氢化能力，适用于各种需要氢气的反应。考虑数据解释的关键因素包括反应条件（温度、压力）、催化剂制备方法以及感兴趣的特定属性（表面反应性、选择性）。

3.CO和H2化学吸附技术各有优势和局限性。CO吸附提供了关于金属表面反应性和分散的精确信息，特别是对于涉及碳的反应。然而，它可能无法完全捕捉到催化剂的氢化能力。相反，H2吸附有效地评估了氢化潜力，但可能不能明确揭示特定碳基反应的机制。数据归一化确保了不同催化剂和实验设置之间的可比性。

4.RDP合成催化剂中观察到的选择性增强归因于铂和促进剂之间紧密接触的结果，导致了更高效的氢化选择性。RDP技术通过促进金属之间的更好相互作用，使氢化过程更加有效。这与通过浸渍湿法制备的催化剂相比，后者缺乏紧密接触，导致较低的选择性。

5.在不同条件下观察到的活性变化受压力、反应物浓度和催化剂制备方法等因素的影响。通过促进铂和促进剂之间的紧密接触，RDP技术可以改变活动性的最优条件，证明其在不同条件下增强催化性能的有效性。
