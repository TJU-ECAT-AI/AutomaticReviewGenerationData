[1] "In early studies, the promoter salts were added in the reactor during the hydrogenation."
[2] "Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[3] "Moreover, identification of the nature of the bimetallic phase remains challenging."
[4] "In a review of Mallat et al. preparation of bimetallic catalysts via RDP has also been described."
[5] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated,"
[6] "Detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."
[7] "For reasons of comparison, tin was also added via incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)."
[8] "The hydrogen chemisorption results are also summarized in Table 3 and expressed as H/Pt ratio."
[9] "This suggests that upon deposition of higher concentrations of promoter, a lower amount of hydrogenation sites is available on the catalysts,"
[10] "Analysis of the elemental maps was limited to areas of 25 nm."
[11] "Based on this characterization technique, it is therefore tentatively concluded that platinum and promoters are in close vicinity."
[12] "For all samples PtPt, PtSn and two PtO (long: PtOl and short: PtOs) contributions were found."
[13] "The coordination numbers for the PtO contributions at long and at short distance do not show a trend as function of the synthesis method."
[14] "The PtSn contribution was the lowest (0.5) for PtSnCl4/IWI-5 and increased to 0.8 and 1.2 for PtSnCl4/RDP-5 and PtSnCl4/RDP-1."
[15] "For the IWI synthesized sample, a stronger white line, as compared to the RPD samples, is observed and its edge position shifted by about 2 eV to higher energy."
[16] "The fit results for PtSnCl4/IWI-5 show that a substantial SnO contribution is observed with a coordination number of 5.1, while the SnPt and SnSn contributions are 1.6 and 0.5, respectively."
[17] "The initial hydrogenation activities, the reaction time required to obtain 50% CALD conversion and the selectivity towards CALC are shown."
[18] "From Fig. 10 and Table 5 it can be seen that at low pressure, catalysts prepared via RDP are more selective and active compared to the monometallic catalyst."
[19] "As for the low pressure experiments also at high hydrogenation pressure, RDP synthesized bimetallic catalysts resulted in enhanced selectivities irrespective the used precursor, while the IWI prepared catalyst resulted in a slightly lower selectivity compared to the monometallic catalyst."
[20] "Since multiple variables are present when comparing high pressure tests to low pressure tests, e.g. different reactant concentrations and different hydrogenation pressures, this behavior cannot be ascribed to one particular reaction parameter yet."
[21] "The RDP synthesis results in close contact of tin with platinum, thereby forming a close interaction of the two metals."
[22] "The increase in selectivity observed with RDP synthesized catalysts is not observed for the bimetallic catalyst prepared via IWI synthesis where close platinumtin interaction is absent."

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are used to characterize bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption determines the number of available active sites, while H2 chemisorption provides insight into the metal dispersion and accessibility of these sites. CO chemisorption is advantageous for its direct measurement of adsorption kinetics and high specificity, whereas H2 chemisorption offers a simple and inexpensive method to quantify the surface area. Limitations include the requirement for specialized equipment and potential interference from other adsorbates. Key considerations for data interpretation involve normalization for surface area and accounting for the effect of reaction conditions on chemisorption behavior.

2. RDP (reductive deposition precipitation) and IWI (incipient wetness impregnation) are two methodologies for preparing bimetallic catalysts. RDP involves the deposition of a metal under hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in a close contact between the metals. IWI, on the other hand, impregnates the support with the metal salt, potentially leading to a less controlled distribution. RDP is advantageous for its ability to produce catalysts with a close interaction between metals, whereas IWI can result in a less uniform distribution. However, IWI is simpler to perform and may be more scalable.

3. The H/Pt ratio, derived from hydrogen chemisorption, quantifies the number of hydrogen molecules adsorbed per platinum atom. It correlates with the density of active sites on the catalyst surface. A higher H/Pt ratio indicates a greater number of active sites, suggesting a more active catalyst. The ratio is a critical parameter for evaluating catalyst performance, particularly in hydrogenation reactions.

4. The elemental mapping analysis reveals that platinum and promoters are in close proximity, as evidenced by the correlation of platinum and promoter signals in the elemental maps. This indicates that RDP effectively brings the metals into close contact, enhancing their interaction and potentially improving catalytic activity and selectivity.

5. EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption fine structure) studies provide detailed information on the coordination environment around the active metal, revealing the presence of PtPt, PtSn, and PtO contributions. The PtO contributions at long and short distances do not exhibit a clear trend with the synthesis method, suggesting that the nature of these interactions may not significantly influence the catalytic performance. The PtSn contribution increases with the RDP synthesis method, indicating better interaction between platinum and tin.

6. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements confirm the presence of tin in the reduced form (tin(II)) for the RDP samples, while tin(IV) is observed in the IWI sample. This reduction likely occurs due to the interaction of tin with the hydrogen-saturated platinum surface during the RDP process, enhancing the close interaction between the metals.

7. The selectivity and activity of the catalysts prepared via RDP are superior to those prepared via IWI, especially at low hydrogenation pressures. This improvement is attributed to the close interaction between the platinum and tin or gallium in the RDP samples, which enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol.

8. At high hydrogenation pressures, the selectivity of the catalysts decreases compared to the low-pressure conditions. This behavior could be attributed to the interplay between increased pressure, decreased cinnamaldehyde concentration, and the specific properties of the catalysts, such as the size and dispersion of the active sites.

9. The selectivity enhancement observed with RDP synthesized catalysts is not replicated in the IWI samples, highlighting the importance of close metal interaction for achieving optimal catalytic performance. The lack of such interaction in the IWI samples limits their activity and selectivity compared to the RDP samples.

10. The selectivity trends observed at both low and high hydrogenation pressures are consistent, suggesting that the mechanism driving the enhanced selectivity is not solely dependent on the hydrogenation pressure but is likely influenced by the preparation method and the resulting metal interaction.

11. The RDP synthesis method facilitates a close interaction between platinum and tin or gallium, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of selectivity for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. This interaction is not achieved in the IWI samples, where the close contact between the metals is absent.

12. The selectivity increase with RDP synthesized catalysts is not solely dependent on the amount of promoter but is also influenced by the reaction conditions, such as hydrogenation pressure and reactant concentration. The complexity of these interactions necessitates further investigation to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.

13. The close contact between platinum and tin or gallium, as achieved through RDP synthesis, is crucial for enhancing the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts. This close interaction is responsible for the improved selectivity observed in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol, demonstrating the superiority of RDP over IWI in terms of catalyst design.

14. The selectivity increase in RDP synthesized catalysts is not replicated in IWI samples, indicating that the lack of close metal interaction leads to inferior catalytic performance. This highlights the importance of precise control over the metal distribution and interaction in the synthesis process to achieve optimal catalytic activity and selectivity.

15. The selectivity trends at both low and high hydrogenation pressures are consistent, implying that the mechanism driving the enhanced selectivity is not exclusively pressure-dependent but also influenced by the preparation method and metal interaction characteristics.

1. CO和H2化学吸附技术用于表征双金属催化剂。CO吸附提供了活性位点的数量，而H2吸附提供了表面面积和金属分散性的信息。CO吸附的优点是直接测量吸附动力学和高特异性，而H2吸附则提供了一个简单且成本低廉的方法来量化表面面积。需要考虑的关键参数包括对反应条件的校正以及表面面积的归一化。

2. RDP（还原沉积沉淀）和IWI（浸渍湿法）是两种准备双金属催化剂的方法。RDP涉及在氢气氛下沉积金属，导致金属之间的紧密接触。相比之下，IWI通过浸渍支持物中的金属盐可能产生分布不均匀的结果。RDP的优势在于能够产生具有紧密金属相互作用的催化剂，而IWI则更简单易行且可能更容易实现规模化生产。

3. H/Pt比率，由氢吸附量计算得出，反映了每单位铂原子上的氢分子数量。它与催化剂表面活性位点的密度相关联。较高的H/Pt比率表示存在更多的活性位点，暗示了更高的催化剂活性。此比率是评估催化剂性能的重要参数，特别是在氢化反应中。

4. 元素映射分析表明，铂和促进剂处于紧密接触状态，因为铂和促进剂信号在元素映射图中相关联。这表明RDP有效地带来了金属之间的紧密接触，从而增强了催化活性和选择性。

5. EXAFS研究提供了关于活性金属周围配位环境的详细信息，揭示了PtPt、PtSn和PtO贡献的存在。长距离和短距离的PtO贡献没有明显的合成方法趋势，表明这些相互作用的性质可能不会显著影响催化性能。PtSn贡献随着RDP合成方法的增加而增加，表明RDP能够更好地将铂与锡或镓结合在一起。

6. XPS测量证实了RDP样品中的锡为还原形式（锡(II)），而IWI样品中的锡为氧化形式。这种还原可能是由于锡与氢饱和铂表面在RDP过程中相互作用而导致的，从而增强了铂和锡或镓之间的紧密接触。

7. 通过RDP方法制备的催化剂在低氢化压力下的选择性和活性优于通过IWI方法制备的催化剂，尤其是在低氢化压力条件下。这种改进归因于RDP样品中铂和锡或镓之间形成的紧密相互作用，从而提高了对cinnamaldehyde氢化为cinnamyl alcohol的选择性和活性。

8. 在高压条件下，催化剂的选择性较之低压条件有所下降。这种行为可能是由于压力增加、cinnamaldehyde浓度降低以及催化剂特性（如活性位点的大小和分散性）的综合影响所导致。

9. RDP方法合成的催化剂选择性的增加并非仅依赖于促进剂的量，而是还受反应条件（如氢化压力和反应物浓度）的影响。这些相互作用的复杂性需要进一步研究以完全理解其内在机制。

10. 铂和锡或镓之间的紧密接触，通过RDP合成方法实现，对于提高双金属催化剂的性能至关重要。这种紧密接触负责在cinnamaldehyde氢化为cinnamyl alcohol过程中观察到的选择性提高，表明RDP方法在催化剂设计方面的优越性超过IWI方法。

11. RDP方法合成的催化剂选择性的增加并未在IWI样品中复制，这表明缺乏紧密金属相互作用导致了较差的催化性能。这强调了精确控制金属分布和相互作用在合成过程中的重要性，以实现最佳催化活性和选择性。

12. 在低压和高压条件下观察到的选择性趋势是一致的，这意味着驱动增强选择性的机制不仅取决于压力，还受到制备方法和金属相互作用特征的影响。

13. RDP方法合成的催化剂选择性的提高并不依赖于促进剂的量，而是也受反应条件（如氢化压力和反应物浓度）的影响。这种相互作用的复杂性需要进一步研究以完全理解其内在机制。

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques were utilized to assess bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption measures the adsorption of carbon monoxide molecules, providing insights into the surface area and metal dispersion. H2 chemisorption quantifies the availability of hydrogenation sites, indicating the surface reactivity. Both methods offer valuable data on active sites and metal dispersion, but their effectiveness depends on the specific catalyst and the targeted reaction mechanism. CO chemisorption tends to correlate better with CO hydrogenation reactions, whereas H2 chemisorption is more indicative of hydrogenation capabilities in general. Normalization of data typically involves comparing the adsorbed species to the metal loading or the total surface area.

2. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques differ in their methodologies and applications. CO chemisorption is primarily employed for understanding surface reactions involving carbon-containing species, such as CO, CO2, and hydrocarbons. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, is more broadly used to evaluate the hydrogenation capability of catalysts, applicable across various reactions requiring hydrogen. Key considerations for interpreting data include reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), catalyst preparation methods, and the specific properties of interest (surface reactivity, selectivity).

3. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques offer distinct advantages and limitations. CO chemisorption provides precise information on the surface reactivity and dispersion of metals, particularly for reactions involving carbon species. However, it may not fully capture the hydrogenation capabilities of catalysts. Conversely, H2 chemisorption effectively evaluates hydrogenation potential but may not elucidate the specific mechanisms involved in carbon-based reactions. Normalization of data ensures comparability across different catalysts and experimental setups.

4. The selectivity enhancement observed with RDP synthesized catalysts is attributed to the close contact between platinum and the promoter, leading to improved hydrogenation selectivity. The RDP technique enables a better interaction between the metals, facilitating more efficient hydrogenation processes. This contrasts with IWI synthesis, where the lack of close interaction results in lower selectivity.

5. The variation in activity observed between different conditions is influenced by factors such as pressure, reactant concentration, and catalyst preparation methods. The RDP technique, through promoting a close interaction between platinum and the promoter, can shift the optimal conditions for activity, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing catalytic performance under varying conditions.

1.CO和H2化学吸附技术被用来评估双金属催化剂。CO吸附测量了碳氧化合物分子的吸附，提供了表面积和金属分散的信息。H2吸附量化了氢化位点的吸附，表明表面反应性。这两种方法在活性位点和金属分散方面提供了有价值的资料，但它们的有效性取决于特定催化剂和目标反应机制。CO吸附通常与涉及碳的反应（如CO、CO2和烃类）更相关，而H2吸附则更多地指示了氢化的潜在能力，适用于各种需要氢气的反应。数据归一化通常涉及将吸附的物种与金属负载或总面积进行比较。

2.CO和H2化学吸附技术在方法论和应用上存在差异。CO吸附主要用于理解涉及碳基物种（如CO、CO2和烃类）的表面反应。H2吸附则更广泛地用于评估催化剂的氢化能力，适用于各种需要氢气的反应。考虑数据解释的关键因素包括反应条件（温度、压力）、催化剂制备方法以及感兴趣的特定属性（表面反应性、选择性）。

3.CO和H2化学吸附技术各有优势和局限性。CO吸附提供了关于金属表面反应性和分散的精确信息，特别是对于涉及碳的反应。然而，它可能无法完全捕捉到催化剂的氢化能力。相反，H2吸附有效地评估了氢化潜力，但可能不能明确揭示特定碳基反应的机制。数据归一化确保了不同催化剂和实验设置之间的可比性。

4.RDP合成催化剂中观察到的选择性增强归因于铂和促进剂之间紧密接触的结果，导致了更高效的氢化选择性。RDP技术通过促进金属之间的更好相互作用，使氢化过程更加有效。这与通过浸渍湿法制备的催化剂相比，后者缺乏紧密接触，导致较低的选择性。

5.在不同条件下观察到的活性变化受压力、反应物浓度和催化剂制备方法等因素的影响。通过促进铂和促进剂之间的紧密接触，RDP技术可以改变活动性的最优条件，证明其在不同条件下增强催化性能的有效性。

The chemisorption techniques, specifically hydrogen chemisorption, are used to determine the number of accessible platinum sites on the catalyst surface. This is done by measuring the hydrogen chemisorption capacity, which is expressed as a H/Pt ratio. Higher H/Pt ratios indicate more available platinum sites. In this study, the highest H/Pt ratio was observed for monometallic Pt/CNF-973, suggesting that this catalyst has the most accessible platinum sites. The decrease in H/Pt ratio with increasing tin-loading in the RDP prepared samples suggests that tin coverage on the platinum surface reduces the number of available sites, implying better dispersion of tin over the platinum surface for RDP prepared samples.

化学吸附技术，特别是氢吸附，用于确定催化剂表面可访问的铂位点数量。这通过测量氢吸附能力并以H/Pt比例表达来完成。较高的H/Pt比表示更多的可用铂位点。在本研究中，单金属Pt/CNF-973显示出最高的H/Pt比，这表明该催化剂具有最多的可访问铂位点。随着RDP制备样品中锡负载量的增加，H/Pt比的降低表明铂表面上的锡覆盖减少了可用位点的数量，暗示RDP制备的样品中锡在铂表面有更好的分散性。
