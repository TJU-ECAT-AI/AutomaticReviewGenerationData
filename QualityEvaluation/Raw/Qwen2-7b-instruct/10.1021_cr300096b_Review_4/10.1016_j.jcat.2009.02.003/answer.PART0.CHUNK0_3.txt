[1] "All samples had a BET surface area of about 180 m2/g and a mesopore volume of about 0.26 mL/g."
[2] "In general an increasing intended tin-loading resulted in a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP prepared samples."
[3] "For reasons of comparison, a reference material was prepared by impregnation and treatment of SnCl4 on CNF at 473 K in H2/N2 flow, referred to as SnCl4/CNF."
[4] "It has been reported before that the addition of a second metal can result an increasing as well as a decreasing activity."
[5] "Since multiple variables are present when comparing high pressure tests to low pressure tests, e.g. different reactant concentrations and different hydrogenation pressures, this behavior cannot be ascribed to one particular reaction parameter yet."

1. All samples had a BET surface area of approximately 180 m2/g and a mesopore volume of about 0.26 mL/g.

2. An increasing intended tin-loading led to a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP-prepared samples in general.

3. A reference material was created by impregnating and treating SnCl4 on CNF at 473 K in H2/N2 flow, known as SnCl4/CNF.

4. Adding a second metal can result in either increased or decreased activity, as reported before.

5. The behavior of comparing high pressure tests to low pressure tests cannot be attributed to a single reaction parameter because of the presence of multiple variables, such as different reactant concentrations and hydrogenation pressures.

1. 所有样品的BET表面积约为180 m2/g，介孔体积约为0.26 mL/g。

2. 一般而言，增加预期锡负载导致RDP制备样品的H/Pt比率降低。

3. 通过在473 K下使用H2/N2流体对CNF进行浸渍和处理SnCl4来创建一个参考材料，称为SnCl4/CNF。

4. 添加第二金属可以导致活动量增加或减少，这之前已经被报告过。

5. 比较高压测试与低压测试的行为无法归因于单一反应参数，因为存在多个变量，如不同反应物浓度和氢化压力。
