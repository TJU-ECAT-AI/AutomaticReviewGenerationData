Catalysts based on platinumtin and platinumgallium in close contact for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde Abstract Bimetallic platinumtin and platinumgallium catalysts supported on carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared via reductive deposition precipitation and impregnation.
Graphical abstract Platinumtin catalysts were prepared via (A) impregnation and (B) reductive deposition precipitation. Via (A), a PtSn interaction was absent while via (B) close interaction was observed, thereby enhancing catalytic selectivity.

The chemisorption techniques, specifically hydrogen chemisorption, are used to determine the number of accessible platinum sites on the catalyst surface. This is done by measuring the hydrogen chemisorption capacity, which is expressed as a H/Pt ratio. Higher H/Pt ratios indicate more available platinum sites. In this study, the highest H/Pt ratio was observed for monometallic Pt/CNF-973, suggesting that this catalyst has the most accessible platinum sites. The decrease in H/Pt ratio with increasing tin-loading in the RDP prepared samples suggests that tin coverage on the platinum surface reduces the number of available sites, implying better dispersion of tin over the platinum surface for RDP prepared samples.

化学吸附技术，特别是氢吸附，用于确定催化剂表面可访问的铂位点数量。这通过测量氢吸附能力并以H/Pt比例表达来完成。较高的H/Pt比表示更多的可用铂位点。在本研究中，单金属Pt/CNF-973显示出最高的H/Pt比，这表明该催化剂具有最多的可访问铂位点。随着RDP制备样品中锡负载量的增加，H/Pt比的降低表明铂表面上的锡覆盖减少了可用位点的数量，暗示RDP制备的样品中锡在铂表面有更好的分散性。
