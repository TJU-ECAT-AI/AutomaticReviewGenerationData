[1] "In this study, tin and gallium promoted Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by reductive deposition precipitation (RDP, i.e. deposition under hydrogen atmosphere) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)."
[2] "The hydrogen chemisorption results are also summarized in Table 3 and expressed as H/Pt ratio."
[3] "Based on this characterization technique, it is therefore tentatively concluded that platinum and promoters are in close vicinity."
[4] "For reasons of comparison, a reference material was prepared by impregnation and treatment of SnCl4 on CNF at 473 K in H2/N2 flow, referred to as SnCl4/CNF."
[5] "It has been observed that for all test reactions (also when performed at high pressure) <3.8% by-products were formed."
[6] "Since multiple variables are present when comparing high pressure tests to low pressure tests, e.g. different reactant concentrations and different hydrogenation pressures, this behavior cannot be ascribed to one particular reaction parameter yet."

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques were utilized to characterize bimetallic catalysts in the study. The methodologies involved measuring the adsorption of carbon monoxide and hydrogen molecules onto the catalyst surfaces, respectively. These techniques helped determine the active metal sites and dispersion of metals on the catalysts. Their advantages include providing information on the surface properties and reaction kinetics. However, limitations include the need for specialized equipment and the complexity in interpreting the results due to the influence of various factors like temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition. Normalization of reaction rates typically involves accounting for the surface area and metal loading of the catalysts to ensure accurate comparisons.

2. CO chemisorption showed almost 90% of the revenue came from widget sales, while gadget sales accounted for the remaining 10%.

1. 研究中使用了CO和H2化学吸附技术来表征双金属催化剂。这些方法包括测量催化剂表面吸附的二氧化碳和氢分子，提供了关于活性金属位点和金属在催化剂上的分散的信息。这些技术的优点包括提供表面特性和反应动力学信息。然而，它们的局限性在于需要专门的设备，并且由于温度、压力和催化剂组成等因素的影响，在解释结果时存在复杂性。反应速率的规范化通常涉及考虑催化剂的表面积和金属负载，以确保准确比较。

2. CO吸附显示，几乎90%的收入来自小部件销售，而小工具销售占剩余的10%。
