[1] "In early studies, the promoter salts were added in the reactor during the hydrogenation."

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are used to characterize bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption determines the number of available active sites, while H2 chemisorption provides insight into the metal dispersion and accessibility of these sites. CO chemisorption is advantageous for its direct measurement of adsorption kinetics and high specificity, whereas H2 chemisorption offers a simple and inexpensive method to quantify the surface area. Limitations include the requirement for specialized equipment and potential interference from other adsorbates. Key considerations for data interpretation involve normalization for surface area and accounting for the effect of reaction conditions on chemisorption behavior.

2. RDP (reductive deposition precipitation) and IWI (incipient wetness impregnation) are two methodologies for preparing bimetallic catalysts. RDP involves the deposition of a metal under hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in a close contact between the metals. IWI, on the other hand, impregnates the support with the metal salt, potentially leading to a less controlled distribution. RDP is advantageous for its ability to produce catalysts with a close interaction between metals, whereas IWI can result in a less uniform distribution. However, IWI is simpler to perform and may be more scalable.

3. The H/Pt ratio, derived from hydrogen chemisorption, quantifies the number of hydrogen molecules adsorbed per platinum atom. It correlates with the density of active sites on the catalyst surface. A higher H/Pt ratio indicates a greater number of active sites, suggesting a more active catalyst. The ratio is a critical parameter for evaluating catalyst performance, particularly in hydrogenation reactions.

4. The elemental mapping analysis reveals that platinum and promoters are in close proximity, as evidenced by the correlation of platinum and promoter signals in the elemental maps. This indicates that RDP effectively brings the metals into close contact, enhancing their interaction and potentially improving catalytic activity and selectivity.

5. EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption fine structure) studies provide detailed information on the coordination environment around the active metal, revealing the presence of PtPt, PtSn, and PtO contributions. The PtO contributions at long and short distances do not exhibit a clear trend with the synthesis method, suggesting that the nature of these interactions may not significantly influence the catalytic performance. The PtSn contribution increases with the RDP synthesis method, indicating better interaction between platinum and tin.

6. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements confirm the presence of tin in the reduced form (tin(II)) for the RDP samples, while tin(IV) is observed in the IWI sample. This reduction likely occurs due to the interaction of tin with the hydrogen-saturated platinum surface during the RDP process, enhancing the close interaction between the metals.

7. The selectivity and activity of the catalysts prepared via RDP are superior to those prepared via IWI, especially at low hydrogenation pressures. This improvement is attributed to the close interaction between the platinum and tin or gallium in the RDP samples, which enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol.

8. At high hydrogenation pressures, the selectivity of the catalysts decreases compared to the low-pressure conditions. This behavior could be attributed to the interplay between increased pressure, decreased cinnamaldehyde concentration, and the specific properties of the catalysts, such as the size and dispersion of the active sites.

9. The selectivity enhancement observed with RDP synthesized catalysts is not replicated in the IWI samples, highlighting the importance of close metal interaction for achieving optimal catalytic performance. The lack of such interaction in the IWI samples limits their activity and selectivity compared to the RDP samples.

10. The selectivity trends observed at both low and high hydrogenation pressures are consistent, suggesting that the mechanism driving the enhanced selectivity is not solely dependent on the hydrogenation pressure but is likely influenced by the preparation method and the resulting metal interaction.

11. The RDP synthesis method facilitates a close interaction between platinum and tin or gallium, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of selectivity for the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. This interaction is not achieved in the IWI samples, where the close contact between the metals is absent.

12. The selectivity increase with RDP synthesized catalysts is not solely dependent on the amount of promoter but is also influenced by the reaction conditions, such as hydrogenation pressure and reactant concentration. The complexity of these interactions necessitates further investigation to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.

13. The close contact between platinum and tin or gallium, as achieved through RDP synthesis, is crucial for enhancing the catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts. This close interaction is responsible for the improved selectivity observed in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol, demonstrating the superiority of RDP over IWI in terms of catalyst design.

14. The selectivity increase in RDP synthesized catalysts is not replicated in IWI samples, indicating that the lack of close metal interaction leads to inferior catalytic performance. This highlights the importance of precise control over the metal distribution and interaction in the synthesis process to achieve optimal catalytic activity and selectivity.

15. The selectivity trends at both low and high hydrogenation pressures are consistent, implying that the mechanism driving the enhanced selectivity is not exclusively pressure-dependent but also influenced by the preparation method and metal interaction characteristics.

1. CO和H2化学吸附技术用于表征双金属催化剂。CO吸附提供了活性位点的数量，而H2吸附提供了表面面积和金属分散性的信息。CO吸附的优点是直接测量吸附动力学和高特异性，而H2吸附则提供了一个简单且成本低廉的方法来量化表面面积。需要考虑的关键参数包括对反应条件的校正以及表面面积的归一化。

2. RDP（还原沉积沉淀）和IWI（浸渍湿法）是两种准备双金属催化剂的方法。RDP涉及在氢气氛下沉积金属，导致金属之间的紧密接触。相比之下，IWI通过浸渍支持物中的金属盐可能产生分布不均匀的结果。RDP的优势在于能够产生具有紧密金属相互作用的催化剂，而IWI则更简单易行且可能更容易实现规模化生产。

3. H/Pt比率，由氢吸附量计算得出，反映了每单位铂原子上的氢分子数量。它与催化剂表面活性位点的密度相关联。较高的H/Pt比率表示存在更多的活性位点，暗示了更高的催化剂活性。此比率是评估催化剂性能的重要参数，特别是在氢化反应中。

4. 元素映射分析表明，铂和促进剂处于紧密接触状态，因为铂和促进剂信号在元素映射图中相关联。这表明RDP有效地带来了金属之间的紧密接触，从而增强了催化活性和选择性。

5. EXAFS研究提供了关于活性金属周围配位环境的详细信息，揭示了PtPt、PtSn和PtO贡献的存在。长距离和短距离的PtO贡献没有明显的合成方法趋势，表明这些相互作用的性质可能不会显著影响催化性能。PtSn贡献随着RDP合成方法的增加而增加，表明RDP能够更好地将铂与锡或镓结合在一起。

6. XPS测量证实了RDP样品中的锡为还原形式（锡(II)），而IWI样品中的锡为氧化形式。这种还原可能是由于锡与氢饱和铂表面在RDP过程中相互作用而导致的，从而增强了铂和锡或镓之间的紧密接触。

7. 通过RDP方法制备的催化剂在低氢化压力下的选择性和活性优于通过IWI方法制备的催化剂，尤其是在低氢化压力条件下。这种改进归因于RDP样品中铂和锡或镓之间形成的紧密相互作用，从而提高了对cinnamaldehyde氢化为cinnamyl alcohol的选择性和活性。

8. 在高压条件下，催化剂的选择性较之低压条件有所下降。这种行为可能是由于压力增加、cinnamaldehyde浓度降低以及催化剂特性（如活性位点的大小和分散性）的综合影响所导致。

9. RDP方法合成的催化剂选择性的增加并非仅依赖于促进剂的量，而是还受反应条件（如氢化压力和反应物浓度）的影响。这些相互作用的复杂性需要进一步研究以完全理解其内在机制。

10. 铂和锡或镓之间的紧密接触，通过RDP合成方法实现，对于提高双金属催化剂的性能至关重要。这种紧密接触负责在cinnamaldehyde氢化为cinnamyl alcohol过程中观察到的选择性提高，表明RDP方法在催化剂设计方面的优越性超过IWI方法。

11. RDP方法合成的催化剂选择性的增加并未在IWI样品中复制，这表明缺乏紧密金属相互作用导致了较差的催化性能。这强调了精确控制金属分布和相互作用在合成过程中的重要性，以实现最佳催化活性和选择性。

12. 在低压和高压条件下观察到的选择性趋势是一致的，这意味着驱动增强选择性的机制不仅取决于压力，还受到制备方法和金属相互作用特征的影响。

13. RDP方法合成的催化剂选择性的提高并不依赖于促进剂的量，而是也受反应条件（如氢化压力和反应物浓度）的影响。这种相互作用的复杂性需要进一步研究以完全理解其内在机制。
