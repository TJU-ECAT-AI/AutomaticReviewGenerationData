2.2.2 Common Characterization Techniques for Bimetallic Catalysts
CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption.
For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst.
The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites.
However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

Elemental Analysis Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state.
Inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) is also used to quantify the concentration of trace metals within a bimetallic catalyst.
In principle, ICP-AES/OES should have a higher detection limit than AAS for most metals, although it is a more sophisticated and expensive instrument than AAS.

Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two primary forms of electron microscopy to characterize the morphology of catalysts.
Unlike TEM, electrons in SEM are not transmitted through the sample. The most common mode of image capture in SEM is by secondary electrons.
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in both TEM and SEM can be used to measure the chemical composition of the catalyst.

Infrared Spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used to measure the transmission of infrared radiation through a catalyst pellet or reaction environment.
Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) is better suited for aqueous-phase environments.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measures the reflection of the IR light from the catalyst, making it more surface-sensitive than transmission FTIR.

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a synchrotron-based technique used to characterize the local atomic and electronic structures of a catalyst under in situ conditions relevant to catalytic reactions.
The region of the scan that begins before the absorption edge and ranges to 50-100 eV above the edge is known as the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) region.
The region beginning at 50-100 eV above the edge and extending up to 1000 eV past the edge is known as the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region.

2.2.3 Example: Characterization of Supported PtNi Bimetallic Catalysts
The particle size was determined from a combination of TEM and CO chemisorption analysis.
The Pt-termination of the catalyst particle was derived by comparing the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO on PtNi/γ-Al2O3 and the corresponding monometallic catalysts.
The presence of fully reduced, metallic Pt and Ni was confirmed following the reduction of white line intensities in XANES during H2 reduction.
The intimate contact between Pt and Ni atoms was verified by the detection of the PtNi nearest neighbor in the EXAFS measurements.

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques both play crucial roles in characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption primarily helps in determining the number of active metal sites by measuring CO uptake. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, aids in estimating the dispersion of metals on the catalyst surface. While CO chemisorption offers a straightforward method for site determination, it might not always accurately represent dispersion. H2 chemisorption provides insights into metal dispersion but requires caution due to hydrogen's tendency to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature. Both methods require normalization of reaction rates by CO uptake values for comparative analysis.

2. Elemental analysis techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) are essential for quantifying metal concentrations in bimetallic catalysts. AAS is a cost-effective method for measuring the concentration of metallic ions, while ICP-AES/OES offers higher detection limits and sensitivity, albeit at a higher cost.

3. Electron microscopy techniques, specifically TEM and SEM, are indispensable for morphological characterization of catalysts. TEM provides high-resolution images, allowing for detailed analysis of particle size and morphology, whereas SEM offers topographic information and a 3D appearance, suitable for studying catalyst surfaces. EDS in both TEM and SEM can measure chemical composition.

4. FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for determining the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates and measuring concentrations of reactants and products. ATR-IR and DRIFTS are advantageous for aqueous-phase environments, offering enhanced sensitivity to surface interactions.

5. XAS provides detailed information about the local atomic and electronic structures of catalysts under in situ conditions. The XANES region aids in identifying the oxidation states of metals, while the EXAFS region reveals the coordination environment around the metal atoms. Combined with other techniques like XRD, XAS offers comprehensive insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

6. The example of PtNi bimetallic catalysts illustrates how a combination of TEM, CO chemisorption, XAS, and EDS can provide a holistic understanding of catalyst properties. CO chemisorption helped in determining the particle size, while XAS confirmed the presence of fully reduced metals. EDS measured the chemical composition, aiding in the confirmation of the Pt-termination and the intimate contact between Pt and Ni atoms.
