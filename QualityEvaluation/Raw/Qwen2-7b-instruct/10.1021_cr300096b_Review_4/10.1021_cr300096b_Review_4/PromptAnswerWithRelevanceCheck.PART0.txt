CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption.
Elemental Analysis Two techniques are commonly used to quantify the concentrations of elements in supported bimetallic catalysts. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is used to measure the temperatures at which metals and/or supports are reduced in a catalyst.
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two primary forms of electron microscopy to characterize the morphology of catalysts.
Infrared Spectroscopy Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates adsorbed on catalysts, as well as to measure the concentrations of reactants and products in the gas or aqueous phase.
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a synchrotron-based technique used to characterize the local atomic and electronic structures of a catalyst under in situ conditions relevant to catalytic reactions.

1. CO chemisorption and H2 chemisorption techniques both contribute to characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption primarily aids in determining the number of active metal sites, while H2 chemisorption helps in understanding the number of active metal sites and estimating metal dispersion. CO chemisorption is effective for assessing active sites, but it assumes a 1:1 stoichiometry of metal to CO, which might not always be accurate. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, can also be utilized to determine the number of active metal sites, albeit with potential inaccuracies due to the desorption of hydrogen from some surfaces at room temperature.

2. Elemental analysis techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) are employed to quantify the concentrations of elements in supported bimetallic catalysts. AAS is a quantitative method for measuring the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state, while ICP-AES/OES offers higher detection limits for most metals compared to AAS, though it is more complex and expensive.

3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) are instrumental in measuring the reduction and oxidation temperatures of catalysts, respectively. These techniques provide insights into the optimal reduction temperature for a catalyst and whether the presence of Pt reduces the reduction temperature of bimetallic catalysts. TPO can also determine the strength of interaction between surface carbon and the supported catalyst.

4. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two electron microscopy methods used to characterize catalyst morphology. TEM is particularly adept at visualizing catalyst morphology and high atomic number transition metals on low-Z metal oxides through bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) imaging, especially with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode. SEM, on the other hand, provides topographic information and a 3D appearance, useful for characterizing catalyst surfaces.

5. Infrared spectroscopy, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis DRS), serves as a valuable tool for determining the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates and measuring reactant and product concentrations. UVvis DRS specifically uses higher-energy radiation to probe the band gap of metals for insights into their oxidation states.

6. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful synchrotron-based technique for characterizing the local atomic and electronic structures of catalysts under relevant in situ conditions. XAS measurements utilize a monochromatic X-ray beam to collect the absorption coefficient as a function of X-ray energy, enabling detailed analysis of metal coordination numbers, oxidation states, and local environments.

1. 一氧化碳吸附和氢气吸附技术均有助于表征双金属催化剂。一氧化碳吸附主要帮助确定活性金属位点的数量，而氢气吸附则有助于理解活性金属位点的数量并估算金属分散度。一氧化碳吸附对于评估活性位点很有成效，但假设金属与一氧化碳的比例为1:1（M=Pt、Ni、Pd等），这一比例显然过于简化。氢气吸附也可以用来确定活性金属位点的数量，尽管由于室温下表面氢开始脱附的潜在不准确性。

2. 元素分析技术如原子吸收光谱法（AAS）和等离子体原子/光学发射光谱法（ICP-AES/OES）被用于量化支持的双金属催化剂中的元素浓度。AAS是一种定量方法，用于测量自由原子在气体状态下的光吸收，而ICP-AES/OES相比AAS具有更高的检测限，但更复杂且成本更高。

3. 温度程序化还原（TPR）和温度程序化氧化（TPO）分别用于测量催化剂中金属和/或支撑材料的还原和氧化温度。这些技术提供了关于催化剂最佳还原温度的信息，并揭示了铂是否存在时是否会降低双金属催化剂的还原温度。TPO还可以确定表面碳与支持催化剂之间的作用力强度。

4. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）和扫描电子显微镜（SEM）是两种用于表征催化剂形态的方法。TEM特别擅长通过明亮场（BF）和暗场（DF）成像以及扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM）的高角度环形暗场（HAADF）模式来可视化催化剂形态和低Z金属氧化物上的高原子序数过渡金属。相比之下，SEM提供了丰富的地形信息和三维外观，适用于表征催化剂表面。

5. 红外光谱法，包括傅里叶变换红外光谱法（FTIR）、衰减全反射红外光谱法（ATR-IR）、弥散反射红外傅里叶变换光谱法（DRIFTS）和紫外可见弥散反射光谱法（UVvis DRS），作为确定反应中间体的键合配置和测量气体或水相中反应物和产物浓度的有价值工具。UVvis DRS使用较高能量的辐射来探查金属的带隙，从而了解它们的氧化状态。

6. X射线吸收光谱法（XAS）是一种强大的同步加速器基技术，用于在相关原位条件下表征催化剂的局部原子和电子结构。XAS测量利用单色X射线束收集X射线能量函数的吸收系数，使金属配位数、氧化状态和局部环境的详细分析成为可能。

For proper comparison of catalytic activity among different catalysts, the reaction rates must be normalized by the values of CO uptake on each catalyst.
The dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites.
However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.

Elemental Analysis Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state.
Inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) is also used to quantify the concentration of trace metals within a bimetallic catalyst.
In principle, ICP-AES/OES should have a higher detection limit than AAS for most metals, although it is a more sophisticated and expensive instrument than AAS.

Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two primary forms of electron microscopy to characterize the morphology of catalysts.
Unlike TEM, electrons in SEM are not transmitted through the sample. The most common mode of image capture in SEM is by secondary electrons.
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in both TEM and SEM can be used to measure the chemical composition of the catalyst.

Infrared Spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used to measure the transmission of infrared radiation through a catalyst pellet or reaction environment.
Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) is better suited for aqueous-phase environments.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measures the reflection of the IR light from the catalyst, making it more surface-sensitive than transmission FTIR.

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a synchrotron-based technique used to characterize the local atomic and electronic structures of a catalyst under in situ conditions relevant to catalytic reactions.
The region of the scan that begins before the absorption edge and ranges to 50-100 eV above the edge is known as the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) region.
The region beginning at 50-100 eV above the edge and extending up to 1000 eV past the edge is known as the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region.

2.2.3 Example: Characterization of Supported PtNi Bimetallic Catalysts
The particle size was determined from a combination of TEM and CO chemisorption analysis.
The Pt-termination of the catalyst particle was derived by comparing the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO on PtNi/γ-Al2O3 and the corresponding monometallic catalysts.
The presence of fully reduced, metallic Pt and Ni was confirmed following the reduction of white line intensities in XANES during H2 reduction.
The intimate contact between Pt and Ni atoms was verified by the detection of the PtNi nearest neighbor in the EXAFS measurements.

1. CO and H2 chemisorption techniques both play crucial roles in characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption primarily helps in determining the number of active metal sites by measuring CO uptake. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, aids in estimating the dispersion of metals on the catalyst surface. While CO chemisorption offers a straightforward method for site determination, it might not always accurately represent dispersion. H2 chemisorption provides insights into metal dispersion but requires caution due to hydrogen's tendency to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature. Both methods require normalization of reaction rates by CO uptake values for comparative analysis.

2. Elemental analysis techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) are essential for quantifying metal concentrations in bimetallic catalysts. AAS is a cost-effective method for measuring the concentration of metallic ions, while ICP-AES/OES offers higher detection limits and sensitivity, albeit at a higher cost.

3. Electron microscopy techniques, specifically TEM and SEM, are indispensable for morphological characterization of catalysts. TEM provides high-resolution images, allowing for detailed analysis of particle size and morphology, whereas SEM offers topographic information and a 3D appearance, suitable for studying catalyst surfaces. EDS in both TEM and SEM can measure chemical composition.

4. FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for determining the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates and measuring concentrations of reactants and products. ATR-IR and DRIFTS are advantageous for aqueous-phase environments, offering enhanced sensitivity to surface interactions.

5. XAS provides detailed information about the local atomic and electronic structures of catalysts under in situ conditions. The XANES region aids in identifying the oxidation states of metals, while the EXAFS region reveals the coordination environment around the metal atoms. Combined with other techniques like XRD, XAS offers comprehensive insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

6. The example of PtNi bimetallic catalysts illustrates how a combination of TEM, CO chemisorption, XAS, and EDS can provide a holistic understanding of catalyst properties. CO chemisorption helped in determining the particle size, while XAS confirmed the presence of fully reduced metals. EDS measured the chemical composition, aiding in the confirmation of the Pt-termination and the intimate contact between Pt and Ni atoms.

2. 元素分析技术，如原子吸收光谱法（AAS）和电感耦合等离子体原子/光学发射光谱法（ICP-AES/OES），对于量化双金属催化剂中的金属浓度至关重要。AAS是一种成本效益高的方法，用于测量金属离子的浓度，而ICP-AES/OES具有更高的检测限和灵敏度，尽管成本更高。

3. 电子显微镜技术，特别是透射电子显微镜（TEM）和扫描电子显微镜（SEM），对于催化剂形态的表征至关重要。TEM提供了高分辨率图像，允许对粒子大小和形态进行详细分析，而SEM提供了丰富的地形信息和三维外观，适用于研究催化剂表面。EDS在TEM和SEM中可以测量化学成分。

4.FTIR光谱技术是确定反应中间体的键合配置并测量气相或水相中反应物和产物浓度的强大工具。ATR-IR和DRIFTS特别适合于水相环境，提供对表面相互作用的增强敏感性。

CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
Elementary Analysis Two techniques are commonly used to quantify the concentrations of elements in supported bimetallic catalysts. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state. In a typical AAS experiment, an analyte solution is prepared by dissolving a supported catalyst, which is then made into an aerosol with a nebulizer and atomized using an air-acetylene flame. The concentration of metallic ions in the solution is obtained after normalizing the AAS intensity with reference compounds.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is used to measure the temperatures at which metals and/or supports are reduced in a catalyst. After calcination, a catalyst is placed in a reactor under flowing H2 and heated at a constant ramp rate. As the temperature increases, the catalyst is reduced by the H2 and oxygen is removed from the catalyst in the form of water. With a TCD connected to the effluent stream, the change in concentration of water can be measured to determine the reduction temperature(s).
