1. CO chemisorption and H2 chemisorption techniques both contribute to characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption primarily aids in determining the number of active metal sites, while H2 chemisorption helps in understanding the number of active metal sites and estimating metal dispersion. CO chemisorption is effective for assessing active sites, but it assumes a 1:1 stoichiometry of metal to CO, which might not always be accurate. H2 chemisorption, on the other hand, can also be utilized to determine the number of active metal sites, albeit with potential inaccuracies due to the desorption of hydrogen from some surfaces at room temperature.

2. Elemental analysis techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) are employed to quantify the concentrations of elements in supported bimetallic catalysts. AAS is a quantitative method for measuring the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state, while ICP-AES/OES offers higher detection limits for most metals compared to AAS, though it is more complex and expensive.

3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) are instrumental in measuring the reduction and oxidation temperatures of catalysts, respectively. These techniques provide insights into the optimal reduction temperature for a catalyst and whether the presence of Pt reduces the reduction temperature of bimetallic catalysts. TPO can also determine the strength of interaction between surface carbon and the supported catalyst.

4. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two electron microscopy methods used to characterize catalyst morphology. TEM is particularly adept at visualizing catalyst morphology and high atomic number transition metals on low-Z metal oxides through bright field (BF) and dark field (DF) imaging, especially with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode. SEM, on the other hand, provides topographic information and a 3D appearance, useful for characterizing catalyst surfaces.

5. Infrared spectroscopy, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis DRS), serves as a valuable tool for determining the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates and measuring reactant and product concentrations. UVvis DRS specifically uses higher-energy radiation to probe the band gap of metals for insights into their oxidation states.

6. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful synchrotron-based technique for characterizing the local atomic and electronic structures of catalysts under relevant in situ conditions. XAS measurements utilize a monochromatic X-ray beam to collect the absorption coefficient as a function of X-ray energy, enabling detailed analysis of metal coordination numbers, oxidation states, and local environments.

1. 一氧化碳吸附和氢气吸附技术均有助于表征双金属催化剂。一氧化碳吸附主要帮助确定活性金属位点的数量，而氢气吸附则有助于理解活性金属位点的数量并估算金属分散度。一氧化碳吸附对于评估活性位点很有成效，但假设金属与一氧化碳的比例为1:1（M=Pt、Ni、Pd等），这一比例显然过于简化。氢气吸附也可以用来确定活性金属位点的数量，尽管由于室温下表面氢开始脱附的潜在不准确性。

2. 元素分析技术如原子吸收光谱法（AAS）和等离子体原子/光学发射光谱法（ICP-AES/OES）被用于量化支持的双金属催化剂中的元素浓度。AAS是一种定量方法，用于测量自由原子在气体状态下的光吸收，而ICP-AES/OES相比AAS具有更高的检测限，但更复杂且成本更高。

3. 温度程序化还原（TPR）和温度程序化氧化（TPO）分别用于测量催化剂中金属和/或支撑材料的还原和氧化温度。这些技术提供了关于催化剂最佳还原温度的信息，并揭示了铂是否存在时是否会降低双金属催化剂的还原温度。TPO还可以确定表面碳与支持催化剂之间的作用力强度。

4. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）和扫描电子显微镜（SEM）是两种用于表征催化剂形态的方法。TEM特别擅长通过明亮场（BF）和暗场（DF）成像以及扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM）的高角度环形暗场（HAADF）模式来可视化催化剂形态和低Z金属氧化物上的高原子序数过渡金属。相比之下，SEM提供了丰富的地形信息和三维外观，适用于表征催化剂表面。

5. 红外光谱法，包括傅里叶变换红外光谱法（FTIR）、衰减全反射红外光谱法（ATR-IR）、弥散反射红外傅里叶变换光谱法（DRIFTS）和紫外可见弥散反射光谱法（UVvis DRS），作为确定反应中间体的键合配置和测量气体或水相中反应物和产物浓度的有价值工具。UVvis DRS使用较高能量的辐射来探查金属的带隙，从而了解它们的氧化状态。

6. X射线吸收光谱法（XAS）是一种强大的同步加速器基技术，用于在相关原位条件下表征催化剂的局部原子和电子结构。XAS测量利用单色X射线束收集X射线能量函数的吸收系数，使金属配位数、氧化状态和局部环境的详细分析成为可能。
