2.2.2 Common Characterization Techniques for Bimetallic Catalysts
CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption.
Elemental Analysis Two techniques are commonly used to quantify the concentrations of elements in supported bimetallic catalysts. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is used to measure the temperatures at which metals and/or supports are reduced in a catalyst.
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two primary forms of electron microscopy to characterize the morphology of catalysts.
Infrared Spectroscopy Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates adsorbed on catalysts, as well as to measure the concentrations of reactants and products in the gas or aqueous phase.
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a synchrotron-based technique used to characterize the local atomic and electronic structures of a catalyst under in situ conditions relevant to catalytic reactions.
2.2.3 Example: Characterization of Supported PtNi Bimetallic Catalysts Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts have been synthesized using various synthesis methods and characterized with many of the techniques described previously.

CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are both employed for characterizing bimetallic catalysts, focusing on determining the number of active metal sites. CO chemisorption offers insights into the active sites' quantity, while H2 chemisorption aids in estimating metal dispersion by assuming a stoichiometry of 1:1. Elemental analysis, particularly through atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), quantifies the concentration of elements in supported catalysts. Temperature-programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR/TPO) are utilized to measure the reduction and oxidation temperatures of catalysts. Electron microscopy, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), provides detailed morphological information on catalysts. Infrared spectroscopy determines the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates and measures reactants' and products' concentrations. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterizes the local atomic and electronic structures of catalysts under relevant catalytic reaction conditions. These techniques collectively offer comprehensive insights into bimetallic catalyst properties.

CO和H2吸附技术均用于表征双金属催化剂，重点关注活性金属位点的数量。CO吸附提供了活性位点数量的信息，而H2吸附通过假设1:1的化学计量比来估计金属分散度。元素分析，特别是通过原子吸收光谱（AAS），量化支持催化剂中的元素浓度。温度程序化还原和氧化（TPR/TPO）用于测量催化剂的还原和氧化温度。电子显微镜，包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）和扫描电子显微镜（SEM），提供了催化剂形态的详细信息。红外光谱确定反应中间体的键合配置，并测量气体或水溶液中反应物和产物的浓度。X射线吸收光谱（XAS）在相关催化反应条件下表征催化剂的局部原子和电子结构。这些技术共同提供了双金属催化剂性质的全面见解。
