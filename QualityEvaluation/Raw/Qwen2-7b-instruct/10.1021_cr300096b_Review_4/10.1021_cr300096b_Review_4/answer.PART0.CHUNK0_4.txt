2.2.2 Common Characterization Techniques for Bimetallic Catalysts
CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption.
CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion by assuming the stoichiometry of M/CO = 1:1 (M = Pt, Ni, Pd, etc.), although the 1:1 ratio is clearly an oversimplification.
Dissociative adsorption of H2 is also used to determine the number of active metal sites.
However, care must be taken because hydrogen starts to desorb from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature.
Elemental Analysis Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state.
Inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES) is also used to quantify the concentration of trace metals within a bimetallic catalyst.
In principle, ICP-AES/OES should have a higher detection limit than AAS for most metals, although it is a more sophisticated and expensive instrument than AAS.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is used to measure the temperatures at which metals and/or supports are reduced in a catalyst.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) is similar in theory to TPR, but it is used to measure the amount of coke deposited on the surface of a catalyst.
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are two primary forms of electron microscopy to characterize the morphology of catalysts.
Recently, there have been advances to correct intrinsic imperfections in the lenses of electron microscopes to improve resolution at very high magnification.
Infrared Spectroscopy Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a very useful technique to determine the bonding configuration of reaction intermediates adsorbed on catalysts.
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a synchrotron-based technique used to characterize the local atomic and electronic structures of a catalyst under in situ conditions relevant to catalytic reactions.

CO and H2 chemisorption techniques are crucial for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption is primarily used to determine the number of active metal sites on the catalyst surface, estimating metal dispersion under the assumption of a 1:1 stoichiometry between metal and CO. While H2 chemisorption also helps in identifying active sites, caution must be exercised due to hydrogen's potential desorption from some bimetallic surfaces at room temperature. Elemental analysis methods, such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES), are employed to quantify the concentration of elements in the catalyst. ICP-AES/OES generally offers higher detection limits for most metals compared to AAS but comes with higher costs and complexity. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and oxidation (TPO) techniques are used to measure the reduction and oxidation temperatures of catalysts, respectively. TEM and SEM offer detailed morphological insights into catalysts, with recent advancements improving their resolution and in situ capabilities. IR spectroscopy aids in understanding the bonding configurations of adsorbed intermediates, while XAS provides information on the local atomic and electronic structures of catalysts under relevant in situ conditions.

对于双金属催化剂，CO和H2化学吸附技术至关重要。CO化学吸附主要用于确定催化剂表面的活性金属位点数量，并在假设金属与CO的1:1摩尔比下估算金属分散度。虽然H2化学吸附也有助于识别活性位点，但必须注意氢气可能在某些双金属表面上在室温下脱附。元素分析方法，如原子吸收光谱（AAS）和等离子体原子/光学发射光谱（ICP-AES/OES），用于定量催化剂中的元素浓度。ICP-AES/OES通常为大多数金属提供更高的检测限，与AAS相比，但成本更高且更复杂。温度程序化还原（TPR）和氧化（TPO）技术分别用于测量催化剂的还原和氧化温度。TEM和SEM提供了对催化剂形态的详细信息，最近的进展提高了它们的分辨率和原位能力。IR光谱有助于理解吸附中间体的键合配置，而XAS提供了催化剂在相关原位条件下局部原子和电子结构的信息。
