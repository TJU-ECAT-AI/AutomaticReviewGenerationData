2.2.2 Common Characterization Techniques for Bimetallic Catalysts
CO and H2 Chemisorption One of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts is the number of active metal sites, which is typically obtained using CO chemisorption. The CO uptake can be measured using many specialized instruments, but as an example, an AMI-200ip (Altamira Instruments) is a viable option. Measurements are performed by loading a known quantity of calcined catalyst into a quartz tube, which is then inserted into the instrument. Catalysts are reduced with a desired H2-containing gas mixture at a specified temperature and then are cooled to room temperature. After cooling, CO is pulsed over the catalyst, and the amount of effluent CO is measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
Elementary Analysis Two techniques are commonly used to quantify the concentrations of elements in supported bimetallic catalysts. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a quantitative technique used to measure the absorption of light by free atoms in the gaseous state. In a typical AAS experiment, an analyte solution is prepared by dissolving a supported catalyst, which is then made into an aerosol with a nebulizer and atomized using an air-acetylene flame. The concentration of metallic ions in the solution is obtained after normalizing the AAS intensity with reference compounds.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction and Oxidation Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is used to measure the temperatures at which metals and/or supports are reduced in a catalyst. After calcination, a catalyst is placed in a reactor under flowing H2 and heated at a constant ramp rate. As the temperature increases, the catalyst is reduced by the H2 and oxygen is removed from the catalyst in the form of water. With a TCD connected to the effluent stream, the change in concentration of water can be measured to determine the reduction temperature(s).

Answer: CO chemisorption and elementary analysis are two common techniques used to characterize bimetallic catalysts. CO chemisorption determines the number of active metal sites on the catalyst by measuring the uptake of carbon monoxide, while elementary analysis quantifies the concentration of elements in the catalyst using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma atomic/optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES/OES).

ChineseVersionAnswer:
答案：CO化学吸附和元素分析是用于表征双金属催化剂的两种常见技术。CO化学吸附通过测量催化剂上一氧化碳的吸附量来确定活性金属位点的数量，而元素分析则使用原子吸收光谱法（AAS）或等离子体原子/光学发射光谱法（ICP-AES/OES）量化催化剂中的元素浓度。

2.2.3 Example: Characterization of Supported PtNi Bimetallic Catalysts
The presence of fully reduced, metallic Pt and Ni was confirmed following the reduction of white line intensities in XANES during H2 reduction. The intimate contact between Pt and Ni atoms was verified by the detection of the PtNi nearest neighbor in the EXAFS measurements. Overall, the Pt-terminated bimetallic particle in Figure 5 is similar to the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure in Figure 3, responsible for the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts for hydrogenation reactions, as discussed later.

Answer: In the characterization of supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts, the presence of fully reduced metallic Pt and Ni was confirmed by observing the reduction of white line intensities in XANES during H2 reduction. The close contact between Pt and Ni atoms was verified through the detection of the PtNi nearest neighbor in the EXAFS measurements. The Pt-terminated bimetallic particle depicted in Figure 5 shares similarities with the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure illustrated in Figure 3, highlighting the strong relationship between model surfaces and supported catalysts for hydrogenation reactions, as explained later.

ChineseVersionAnswer:
答案：在支持型PtNi双金属催化剂的表征过程中，通过在H2还原期间XANES白线强度的降低确认了完全还原的金属Pt和Ni的存在。通过检测EXAFS测量中的PtNi最近邻，验证了Pt和Ni原子之间的紧密接触。图5中所示的Pt终止的双金属颗粒与图3中表示的子表面PtNiPt(111)结构相似，这强调了模型表面与支持催化剂之间氢化反应的强相关性，如后续讨论的那样。
