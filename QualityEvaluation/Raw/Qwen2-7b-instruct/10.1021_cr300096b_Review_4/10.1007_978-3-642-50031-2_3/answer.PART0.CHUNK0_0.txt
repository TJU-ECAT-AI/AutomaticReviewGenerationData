[1] "Before describing in detail the various aspects of EXAFS theory and data analysis techniques, it is instructive to first discuss, qualitatively and graphically, the various variables (or parameters) and functions and their effects and correlations."
[2] "Some third parties are outside of the European Economic Area, with varying standards of data protection."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on the theoretical background and data analysis aspects of EXAFS spectroscopy rather than comparing specific techniques or methods used in catalysis research.
