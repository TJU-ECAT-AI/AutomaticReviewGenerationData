<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the qualitative and graphical discussion of EXAFS parameters and their effects and correlations before delving into detailed theory and data analysis techniques. However, it does not provide specific comparisons between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts.
