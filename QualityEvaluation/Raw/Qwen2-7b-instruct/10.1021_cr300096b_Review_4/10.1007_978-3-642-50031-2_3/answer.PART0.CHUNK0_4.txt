The document does not provide a direct comparison of CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on the principles and data analysis techniques of EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), which is used for structural characterization of materials, rather than specifically addressing CO and H2 chemisorption methods.

文档没有提供直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂时的有效性。它专注于EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）的基本原理和数据分析技术，用于材料的结构表征，而不是专门讨论CO和H2化学吸附方法。
