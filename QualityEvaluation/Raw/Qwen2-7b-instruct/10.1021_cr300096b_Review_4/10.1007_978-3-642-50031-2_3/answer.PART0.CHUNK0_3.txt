The document does not provide a direct comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques for characterizing bimetallic catalysts. It focuses on EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) parameters and their qualitative graphical representation in the context of EXAFS theory and data analysis techniques. However, it does discuss the importance of understanding various variables and their effects in EXAFS analysis, which could be indirectly related to the characterization of catalysts. For a detailed comparison between CO and H2 chemisorption techniques, one would need to consult other specialized literature focused specifically on these methods in the context of catalyst characterization.

文档没有直接比较CO和H2化学吸附技术在表征双金属催化剂方面的有效性。它专注于在EXAFS理论和数据分析技术的背景下，EXAFS参数的定性图形表示。然而，它确实强调了理解各种变量及其影响在EXAFS分析中的重要性，这可能间接与催化剂表征相关。对于详细比较CO和H2化学吸附技术，需要查阅专门针对这些方法在催化剂表征上下文中的其他专著文献。
