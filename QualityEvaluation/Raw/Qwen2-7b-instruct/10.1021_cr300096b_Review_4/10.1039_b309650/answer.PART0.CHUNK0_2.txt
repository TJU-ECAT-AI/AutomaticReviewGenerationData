[1] "The main challenges in this exciting field are:(a) The development of time-resolved spectroscopy, in conjunction with the design and construction of high quality spectroscopic-reaction cells, which allow combining complementary information of two or more characterization techniques. (b) The study of catalytic solid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid reaction systems and the development of tools enabling the study of these catalytic interfaces. (c) The combination of operando microscopy and spectroscopy with the possibility to focus on the catalytic chemistry of one single active site."
[2] "In order to obtain more insight in the reaction mechanism we have conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a periodic La2O3(001) model surface."
[3] "This suggests that the active Cr3+-sites are somehow buried by coke or are partially diffusing into the alumina support surface, hampering their fast re-oxidation."

The main challenges in operando spectroscopy are the development of time-resolved spectroscopy, designing high-quality spectroscopic-reaction cells that can combine information from multiple characterization techniques, studying catalytic interfaces in solid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid systems, and focusing on the chemistry of a single active site through the combination of operando microscopy and spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations were used to gain insight into the reaction mechanism. The slow re-oxidation of active Cr3+ sites during regeneration suggests they are buried or diffusing into the alumina support surface, hindering their quick re-oxidation.
