<p>Understanding how a substrate molecule is transformed into a reaction product over a catalytic material is a curiosity driven challenge.15 Ideally, chemists would like to have fundamental insight in the reaction cycle and how a catalyst material may affect this reaction cycle. This would enable scientists to design better or even new catalytic materials to increase the conversion and selectivity towards the desired reaction product.</p>
<p>Identifying active sites should in principle be possible by studying the catalyst at its working place under real reaction conditions. This is the field of operando spectroscopy, a research area, which is under intense development and of high interest to the catalysis community. This feature article presents an attempt of a roadmap for future operando spectroscopy studies. Two case studies will illustrate the potential and limitations of the operando approach.</p>
<p>A catalytic cycle is a hypothesized network of reaction steps describing how the transformation of a substrate molecule towards a reaction product occurs over one or a cascade of catalytic active sites.</p>
<p>The development of such a network can occur at different levels of sophistication of which the simplest is the formulation of the elementary reaction steps and a description of the overall nature of the catalytic active site. In contrast, the most sophisticated and desired level is the description of the transformation process in terms of (a) reaction trajectories together with the reaction dynamics and kinetics along those trajectories and (b) molecular insight in catalytic active sites and the dynamics towards their coordination environment.</p>
<p>Understanding catalytic reactions at a fundamental level implies that the developed reaction network should be experimentally and theoretically tested in sufficient detail.</p>
<p>At first, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst will be determined. Secondly, the catalyst will be characterized with one or more mainly spectroscopic techniques. Both type of information about the catalyst material will be measured as a function of a set of experimental parameters (reaction temperature, reaction pressure, catalyst composition, etc.).</p>
<p>Linking both sets of databases allows-in principle-the development of the so-called quantitative structureactivity relationships (QSARs).</p>
<p>This approach can be named predictive catalysis or knowledge-based catalyst design. Another possibility is to use the QSARs knowledge in developing an expert system for a particular catalyst, which allows monitoring, by spectroscopic means, the physicochemical changes taking place in the catalyst during chemical operation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, such systems can be used for on-line optimization and fine-tuning of the experimental conditions for a catalytic process.</p>
<p>However, the establishment of useful QSARs is far from evident, simply because the experimental conditions to perform both type of measurements; i.e., catalytic and spectroscopic experiments, are mostly not identical.</p>
<p>To circumvent this problem, spectroscopy should ideally be performed under realistic catalytic conditions. This is the field of in situ spectroscopy; i.e., spectroscopy of the catalyst material, while the catalytic reaction is running.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, performing an ideal in situ experiment is not easy and may remain a fantasy as suggested by Haw in his textbook on in situ spectroscopy of heterogeneous catalysts.23 According to this author, a perfect in situ experiment would look inside an industrial reactor and reveal the most intimate details of a surface chemical reaction, including transition states of reactions.</p>
<p>This-although valuable-argument by J. F. Haw, together with the fact that the word in situ is used in connection with a specific catalyst handling, such as in situ regeneration and in situ activation, has lead to the launch of a new name for the field of Haw's purest definition of in situ spectroscopy. This name is operando spectroscopy and it originates from the Latin gerund, meaning operating or working.</p>
<p>The advantage of the name operando is a clear distinction between in situ spectroscopic studies of a working catalyst under realistic reaction conditions and other interesting-but defined according to the more inclusive definition-in situ studies.</p>

The document discusses operando spectroscopy as a method to study catalysts under real reaction conditions. It explains that operando spectroscopy is a research area under intense development and of high interest to the catalysis community. The article presents a roadmap for future operando spectroscopy studies and highlights two case studies to illustrate the potential and limitations of the operando approach. It also mentions that understanding how a substrate molecule is transformed into a reaction product over a catalytic material is a significant challenge, aiming to develop fundamental insight into the reaction cycle and the catalyst's impact. The development of a catalytic cycle involves formulating elementary reaction steps, describing the overall nature of the catalytic active site, and testing the reaction network experimentally and theoretically. The roadmap suggests that operando spectroscopy can help establish quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), enabling predictive catalysis or knowledge-based catalyst design. The document also notes that the establishment of useful QSARs is challenging due to differences in experimental conditions between catalytic and spectroscopic experiments. It emphasizes the importance of performing spectroscopy under realistic catalytic conditions, leading to the term "operando spectroscopy." The name operando distinguishes studies of working catalysts under realistic reaction conditions from other in situ studies, providing a clear distinction in terminology.
