[1] "The main challenges in this exciting field are: (a) The development of time-resolved spectroscopy, in conjunction with the design and construction of high quality spectroscopic-reaction cells, which allow combining complementary information of two or more characterization techniques. (b) The study of catalytic solid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid reaction systems and the development of tools enabling the study of these catalytic interfaces. (c) The combination of operando microscopy and spectroscopy with the possibility to focus on the catalytic chemistry of one single active site."
[2] "This result suggests that the active site for this process is lattice, rather than adsorbed oxygen, and that gas-phase CCl4 and O2 compete for the active sites."
[3] "Unfortunately, operando vibrational spectroscopy does not allow detecting the proposed surface reaction intermediates."

1. The main challenges in operando spectroscopy are the development of time-resolved spectroscopy, the study of catalytic solid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid reaction systems, and the combination of operando microscopy and spectroscopy to focus on the catalytic chemistry of one single active site.

2. The active site for the chlorinated hydrocarbon decomposition process is lattice oxygen, not adsorbed oxygen, and gas-phase CCl4 and O2 compete for these active sites.

3. Operando vibrational spectroscopy cannot detect the proposed surface reaction intermediates.
