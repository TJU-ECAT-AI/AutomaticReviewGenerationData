<p>Understanding how a substrate molecule is transformed into a reaction product over a catalytic material is a curiosity driven challenge.15 Ideally, chemists would like to have fundamental insight in the reaction cycle and how a catalyst material may affect this reaction cycle. This would enable scientists to design better or even new catalytic materials to increase the conversion and selectivity towards the desired reaction product.</p>
<p>Identifying active sites should in principle be possible by studying the catalyst at its working place under real reaction conditions. This is the field of operando spectroscopy, a research area, which is under intense development and of high interest to the catalysis community. This feature article presents an attempt of a roadmap for future operando spectroscopy studies. Two case studies will illustrate the potential and limitations of the operando approach.</p>
<p>A catalytic cycle is a hypothesized network of reaction steps describing how the transformation of a substrate molecule towards a reaction product occurs over one or a cascade of catalytic active sites.</p>
<p>The development of such a network can occur at different levels of sophistication of which the simplest is the formulation of the elementary reaction steps and a description of the overall nature of the catalytic active site. In contrast, the most sophisticated and desired level is the description of the transformation process in terms of (a) reaction trajectories together with the reaction dynamics and kinetics along those trajectories and (b) molecular insight in catalytic active sites and the dynamics towards their coordination environment.</p>
<p>Understanding catalytic reactions at a fundamental level implies that the developed reaction network should be experimentally and theoretically tested in sufficient detail.</p>
<p>At first, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst will be determined. Secondly, the catalyst will be characterized with one or more mainly spectroscopic techniques. Both type of information about the catalyst material will be measured as a function of a set of experimental parameters (reaction temperature, reaction pressure, catalyst composition, etc.).</p>
<p>Linking both sets of databases allows-in principle-the development of the so-called quantitative structureactivity relationships (QSARs).</p>
<p>This approach can be named predictive catalysis or knowledge-based catalyst design. Another possibility is to use the QSARs knowledge in developing an expert system for a particular catalyst, which allows monitoring, by spectroscopic means, the physicochemical changes taking place in the catalyst during chemical operation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, such systems can be used for on-line optimization and fine-tuning of the experimental conditions for a catalytic process.</p>
<p>However, the establishment of useful QSARs is far from evident, simply because the experimental conditions to perform both type of measurements; i.e., catalytic and spectroscopic experiments, are mostly not identical.</p>
<p>To circumvent this problem, spectroscopy should ideally be performed under realistic catalytic conditions. This is the field of in situ spectroscopy; i.e., spectroscopy of the catalyst material, while the catalytic reaction is running.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, performing an ideal in situ experiment is not easy and may remain a fantasy as suggested by Haw in his textbook on in situ spectroscopy of heterogeneous catalysts.23 According to this author, a perfect in situ experiment would look inside an industrial reactor and reveal the most intimate details of a surface chemical reaction, including transition states of reactions.</p>
<p>This-although valuable-argument by J. F. Haw, together with the fact that the word in situ is used in connection with a specific catalyst handling, such as in situ regeneration and in situ activation, has lead to the launch of a new name for the field of Haw's purest definition of in situ spectroscopy. This name is operando spectroscopy and it originates from the Latin gerund, meaning operating or working.</p>
<p>The advantage of the name operando is a clear distinction between in situ spectroscopic studies of a working catalyst under realistic reaction conditions and other interesting-but defined according to the more inclusive definition-in situ studies.</p>

The document discusses operando spectroscopy as a method to study catalysts under real reaction conditions. It explains that operando spectroscopy is a research area under intense development and of high interest to the catalysis community. The article presents a roadmap for future operando spectroscopy studies and highlights two case studies to illustrate the potential and limitations of the operando approach. It also mentions that understanding how a substrate molecule is transformed into a reaction product over a catalytic material is a significant challenge, aiming to develop fundamental insight into the reaction cycle and the catalyst's impact. The development of a catalytic cycle involves formulating elementary reaction steps, describing the overall nature of the catalytic active site, and testing the reaction network experimentally and theoretically. The roadmap suggests that operando spectroscopy can help establish quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), enabling predictive catalysis or knowledge-based catalyst design. The document also notes that the establishment of useful QSARs is challenging due to differences in experimental conditions between catalytic and spectroscopic experiments. It emphasizes the importance of performing spectroscopy under realistic catalytic conditions, leading to the term "operando spectroscopy." The name operando distinguishes studies of working catalysts under realistic reaction conditions from other in situ studies, providing a clear distinction in terminology.

The main challenges in operando spectroscopy are the development of time-resolved spectroscopy, designing high-quality spectroscopic-reaction cells that can combine information from multiple characterization techniques, studying catalytic interfaces in solid-liquid and gas-liquid-solid systems, and focusing on the chemistry of a single active site through the combination of operando microscopy and spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations were used to gain insight into the reaction mechanism. The slow re-oxidation of active Cr3+ sites during regeneration suggests they are buried or diffusing into the alumina support surface, hindering their quick re-oxidation.

1. The challenge in understanding the transformation of a substrate molecule into a reaction product over a catalytic material lies in its complexity, requiring a deep understanding of the catalytic reaction cycle, the nature of the active site, and the dynamics involved. Predictive catalysis or knowledge-based catalyst design aims to achieve this understanding, but detailed insights have only been reached in a limited number of cases.

2. The process of unraveling the working principles of catalyst materials involves first determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst. This is followed by characterizing the catalyst with spectroscopic techniques, usually as a function of experimental parameters such as reaction temperature, pressure, catalyst composition, etc.

3. The development of a reaction network to describe the catalytic process can occur at various levels of sophistication, ranging from the elementary reaction steps to a comprehensive understanding of the active site and its coordination environment.

4. Establishing quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) is challenging because the experimental conditions for spectroscopic and catalytic measurements are often incompatible. Operando spectroscopy aims to bridge this gap by studying catalysts under real reaction conditions.

5. The ultimate goal of operando spectroscopy is to perform an ideal in situ-or-better operando experiment, as outlined by Haw. This involves developing advanced technology to study catalysts without compromising time scale, temperature, pressure, or reactor design.

6. To advance operando spectroscopy, a roadmap has been proposed with three areas: measuring better, measuring faster, and measuring more. This includes improving spectroscopic techniques, expanding their application to multi-phase reaction systems, and developing single molecule and single site operando spectroscopy-microscopy.

7. In the case of lanthanide oxide-based catalysts, operando Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the active phases during the decomposition of CCl4 in the presence of steam. The study showed that an almost complete transformation of La2O3 into LaOCl occurred, with the formation of a LaCl3 phase after prolonged exposure to the reaction conditions.

8. By varying the molar ratio of water to CCl4 in the inlet feed, the effect of steam on the catalytic solid was investigated. High steam levels preserved the catalytic solid in its La2O3 form, allowing for complete CCl4 conversion, while low water ratios led to the rapid chlorination of La2O3 and a loss of catalytic activity.

9. Operando IR spectra were collected to investigate the formation of possible gaseous intermediates during the decomposition of CCl4 in the presence of steam. Peaks at 2890, 2348, 2143, and 1827 cm-1 were attributed to HCl, CO2, CO, and COCl2, respectively.

10. The addition of oxygen to the system resulted in a decrease of the catalyst activity, suggesting that the active site for the process involves lattice oxygen rather than adsorbed oxygen. Gas-phase CCl4 competes for the active sites.

11. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a periodic La2O3(001) model surface confirmed the reaction mechanism for the decomposition of CCl4 in the presence of steam. The first step involves the stepwise chlorine donation from the hydrocarbon to the surface, followed by chlorine removal with steam.

12. The second step of the catalytic process involves the dechlorination of the catalyst surface with steam and the refreshing of the surface with lattice oxygen atoms. This was confirmed by operando spectroscopy findings that both La2O3 and LaOCl are active catalyst phases.

13. In the case of supported chromium oxide catalysts, operando UVVIS and Raman spectroscopy were used to study the alkane dehydrogenation sites. The UVVIS spectra showed that pseudo-octahedral Cr3+-sites are formed under typical alkane dehydrogenation conditions and are proposed as the active sites for this catalytic process.

14. The operando approach allowed simultaneous measurement of UVVIS, Raman, and catalytic data during dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. The conversion of propane to propene gradually increased with time, reaching a maximum of 10% at the end of the dehydrogenation cycle.

15. The UVVIS spectra showed a gradual transformation of Cr6+ to a second Crn+-species (with n<6) during the dehydrogenation cycle. This transformation was confirmed by the presence of an isobestic point at around 582 nm.

16. During the catalyst regeneration, the operando UVVIS spectra returned to the initial state, but the re-oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ with oxygen was much slower than the reduction of surface chromate in propane. This suggests that the active Cr3+-sites are somehow buried by coke or partially diffusing into the alumina support surface, hampering their fast re-oxidation.

1. 理解一个基质分子如何在催化剂材料上转化为反应产物是一个由好奇心驱动的挑战。这涉及到催化反应周期、活性位点的性质及其动态的理解。

2. 揭示催化剂工作原理的过程首先确定催化剂的催化活性和选择性，然后使用光谱技术进行表征，这些表征通常与一组实验参数（如反应温度、压力、催化剂组成等）有关。

3. 反应网络的开发可以在不同程度的复杂性中进行，从描述基本反应步骤到全面理解活性位点及其配体环境的描述。

4. 建立定量结构-活性关系（QSAR）具有挑战性，因为进行这两种测量（即催化和光谱实验）的实验条件通常是不一致的。原位光谱学旨在通过研究催化剂在真实反应条件下进行。

5. 实现的理想原位或更好的原位实验是Haw概述的目标。这需要发展先进的技术，无需在时间尺度、温度、压力或反应器设计方面做出妥协。

6. 为了推进原位光谱学，提出了一个路线图，包括三个领域：更好地测量、更快地测量和更多地测量。这包括改进光谱技术、扩展其对多相反应系统的应用，并发展单分子和单位点原位光谱学显微镜。

7. 对镧系氧化物基催化剂的研究显示，在蒸汽存在下分解CCl4期间，通过原位拉曼光谱可以识别活性相。研究结果表明，La2O3几乎完全转化为LaOCl，形成LaCl3相后持续暴露于反应条件。

8. 通过改变水和CCl4的进料摩尔比，研究了蒸汽对催化固体的影响。高蒸汽水平保留了催化固体的La2O3形式，允许完成CCl4转化，而低水分比例导致La2O3快速氯化并损失催化活性。

9. 收集了原位红外光谱来研究蒸汽存在下分解CCl4时可能形成的气体中间体。峰值分别位于2890、2348、2143和1827 cm-1，分别归因于HCl、CO2、CO和COCl2。

10. 向系统中添加氧气导致催化剂活性下降，表明该过程的活性位点涉及晶格氧而不是吸附氧。气态CCl4与活性位点竞争。

11. 使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算了周期性La2O3(001)模型表面的反应机制。第一阶段涉及从碳氢化合物向表面的氯捐赠步骤，随后是蒸汽中的氯移除。

12. 第二步的催化过程涉及用蒸汽刷新催化剂表面并用晶格氧原子更新表面。这一发现证实了原位光谱学结果，表明La2O3和LaOCl都是活性催化剂材料。

13. 对支持的铬氧化物催化剂的研究利用原位紫外可见光谱和拉曼光谱来研究烷烃脱氢作用位点。紫外可见光谱表明，在典型的烷烃脱氢条件下，形成伪八面体Cr3+-位点，并被提议为这种催化过程的活性位点。

14. 原位方法允许同时测量紫外可见、拉曼和催化数据，在脱氢再生循环期间。丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率逐渐增加，达到最大值10%，出现在脱氢循环结束时。

15. 紫外可见光谱显示，在脱氢循环期间，Cr6+逐渐转化为第二个Crn+-物种（n<6）。这一点由大约582 nm处的等温峰确认。

16. 在催化剂再生过程中，紫外可见光谱恢复到初始状态，但Cr3+氧化回Cr6+与氧气的速度远慢于丙烷期间表面铬酸盐的还原。这表明活性Cr3+-位点可能部分埋藏在焦炭中或扩散到氧化铝支撑表面中，阻碍它们的快速氧化。
