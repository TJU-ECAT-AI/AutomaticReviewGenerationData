[1] "Both CO chemisorption and EXAFS data indicate that in this series of catalysts, the addition of F to the alumina support is detrimental to the metal dispersion."
[2] "Noticeably, the concentration of residual Cl on the surface, from the metal precursors, was reduced when F was added."
[3] "The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown)."
[4] "The only difference to this behavior was exhibited by the unpromoted Pd catalyst, which despite a higher dispersion, had a lower activity than the promoted Pd/F-Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "Another interesting result is that the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst has a trans/cis selectivity almost identical to that of pure Pd, which would be an indirect confirmation of previous reports that propose a Pd enrichment on the surface of the alloyed Pt-Pd particles."
[6] "On the less active catalyst, at a PHE conversion of 60, there is very low concentration of the totally hydrogenated tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene, as well as of the totally hydrogenated decalin."
[7] "By contrast, on the more active catalyst, the concentration of the more deeply hydrogenated compounds (1-ring) increased."
[8] "Therefore, it appears that the inhibition by sulfur under these conditions is a reversible blocking of sites."
[9] "These results demonstrate the importance of considering the nature of the sulfur compound under the treatment conditions, since the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may be very different from that of the H2S formed from its hydrogenation."
[10] "In line with this conclusion, the presence of PHE greatly affects the adsorption of NP, and particularly that of TL."
[11] "In all cases, becomes significant only after the elimination of 3040% of PHE, while conversion of TL can only start after the PHE conversion is almost complete."

CO chemisorption and EXAFS techniques both provide valuable insights into metal dispersion on catalysts, but CO chemisorption tends to underestimate dispersion due to metal clustering and support effects. Fluorine (F) addition to alumina supports generally reduces metal dispersion, as seen in the decreased CO uptakes. The concentration of residual Cl also decreases with F addition. The observed trends in metal dispersion are consistent with TEM cluster size data. The unpromoted Pd catalyst, despite having higher dispersion, exhibits lower activity than its fluorine-promoted counterpart. The bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst shows a trans/cis selectivity similar to pure Pd, suggesting Pd enrichment on the surface of the alloy. The less active catalyst yields low concentrations of fully hydrogenated products like tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene and decalin, while the more active catalyst increases the concentration of more deeply hydrogenated compounds, such as those with one ring of hydrogenation. The inhibition by sulfur is reversible under certain conditions, and the toxicity of sulfur compounds can differ significantly when hydrogenated to form H2S. The presence of phenanthrene (PHE) significantly influences the adsorption of naphthalene (NP) and tetralin (TL), affecting their hydrogenation rates. The hydrogenation of TL only starts after nearly all PHE has been removed from the feed.

CO化学吸附和EXAFS技术都为催化剂上的金属分散提供了有价值的见解，但CO化学吸附往往低估了分散度，因为存在金属聚集体和支撑效应。向氧化铝支持物中添加氟（F）通常会降低金属分散度，如CO吸收量的减少所示。残留Cl浓度也随F添加而降低。观察到的金属分散趋势与TEM簇大小数据一致。尽管具有更高分散度的Pd催化剂的活性较低，其氟促进的对应物却显示出更高的活性。二元合金Pt-Pd催化剂的顺/反选择性类似于纯Pd，表明Pd在合金表面的富集。活性较低的催化剂产生少量完全氢化产物，如四十二烷氢化物和十氢化萘，而活性较高的催化剂增加了更多深度氢化的化合物，如仅含一个环氢化的化合物。硫抑制是可逆的，在特定条件下，硫化合物的毒性可能大不相同，因为它们被氢化形成H2S。苯并菲（PHE）显著影响萘（NP）和四氢化萘（TL）的吸附，影响它们的氢化速率。只有在从饲料中去除几乎全部PHE后，才开始氢化TL。
