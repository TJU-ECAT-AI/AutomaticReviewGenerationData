<p>The observed TL conversion followed the same trend as metal dispersion. That is, the unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts showed very high activity while the F-promoted catalysts exhibited much lower activity.</p>
<p>A more interesting trend was observed for the trans/cis ratio in the decalin product as a function of conversion on the three catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2 , the trans/cis ratio depended on the catalyst and was practically constant up to about 70% TL conversion.</p>
<p>The product compositions after 4 h on stream for the two different runs are summarized in Table 4 , together with the feed composition. The hydrogenated products contain the hydrophenanthrenes with different degrees of hydrogenation (di-, tetra-, octa-, and tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene).</p>
<p>At the same space velocity (100 h<sup>-1</sup>), the catalyst prepared by aqueous solution, with a higher metal dispersion, exhibited higher hydrogenation activity than the one prepared by ethylene glycol.</p>
<p>It is clear that the F-containing catalyst kept a higher conversion in the presence of DBT, while the monometallic Pt catalyst was most affected. On the other hand, the monometallic Pt catalyst resulted with the highest activity after removal of DBT from the feed.</p>
<p>These results demonstrate the importance of considering the nature of the sulfur compound under the treatment conditions, since the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may be very different from that of the H<sub>2</sub>S formed from its hydrogenation.</p>
<p>Taking data from Table 3 , Table 4 and from Fig. 4 , we have plotted the conversions of NP and TL as a function of PHE conversion. It is remarkable that disparate data like these, taken from different catalysts, with or without S, the conversions of NP and TL are closely related to the conversion of PHE and all lie on the same curve.</p>
<p>For the most part, the total coordination numbers were conserved, which indicates that the formation of PtS bonds arises at the expense of the PtPt and PtPd bonds.</p>

1. The activity of catalysts followed the trend of metal dispersion. Unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts showed high activity, whereas F-promoted catalysts exhibited lower activity.
2. The trans/cis ratio in the decalin product was influenced by the catalyst and remained constant up to approximately 70% TL conversion.
3. The product distribution showed different degrees of hydrogenation for phenanthrenes.
4. A higher metal dispersion in the catalyst prepared by aqueous solution led to higher hydrogenation activity compared to the one prepared by ethylene glycol.
5. F-containing catalysts maintained higher conversion levels in the presence of DBT, while the monometallic Pt catalyst was most affected.
6. Considering the nature of sulfur compounds under treatment conditions is crucial, as the toxicity of sulfur may differ from that of hydrogen sulfide formed from hydrogenation.
7. Data plotted the conversions of naphthalene (NP) and tetralin (TL) as functions of phenanthrene (PHE) conversion, showing close relationships and lying on the same curve across different catalysts and sulfur conditions.
8. The formation of PtS bonds occurred at the expense of PtPt and PtPd bonds, with the total coordination numbers conserved.
