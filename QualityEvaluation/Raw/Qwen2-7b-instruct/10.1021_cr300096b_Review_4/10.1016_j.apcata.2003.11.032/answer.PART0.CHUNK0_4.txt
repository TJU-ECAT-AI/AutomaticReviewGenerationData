[1] "The CO uptakes of all the catalysts investigated are shown in Table 1 . Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."
[2] "This does not seem to be the typical trend. A previous FTIR study [37] has reported improved Pt dispersions on fluorinated alumina compared to those that on unfluorinated supports."
[3] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."
[4] "The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown)."
[5] "These changes seem to adversely affect the dispersion of metals during the calcinations conducted in this work."
[6] "The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol."

CO chemisorption is used to estimate the exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts because hydrogen chemisorption can lead to complications such as spillover, which may distort the true metal dispersion. The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system. The dispersion of metals is affected by the impregnation method used to prepare the catalysts. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using aqueous solution had a higher exposed metal fraction compared to the one prepared using ethylene glycol. The observed trends in metal dispersion are consistent with EXAFS data and TEM cluster sizes.

CO吸附法用于估计不同催化剂中暴露金属的比例（分散度），因为氢吸附可能会导致复杂性，如溢出，这可能会影响真实的金属分散度。CO吸收值只能作为在一种金属系统内差异的半定量测量。金属分散度受到制备催化剂的方法的影响。使用水溶液制备的F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3催化剂的暴露金属比例高于使用乙二醇制备的催化剂。观察到的金属分散度趋势与EXAFS数据和TEM簇大小一致。
