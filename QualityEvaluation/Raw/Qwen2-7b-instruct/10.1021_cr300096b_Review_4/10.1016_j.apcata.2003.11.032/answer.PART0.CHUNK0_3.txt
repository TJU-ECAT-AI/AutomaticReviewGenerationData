[1] "The CO uptake measurements were performed in a 1/4 in. quartz reactor containing 0.100 g catalyst after reduction in a 50 ml/min flow of H2 at 300 C for 1 h."
[2] "The addition of F to the alumina support is detrimental to the metal dispersion."
[3] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."
[4] "EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions."

1. CO chemisorption is a technique used to determine the active metal sites and metal dispersion on a catalyst. It involves measuring the amount of carbon monoxide adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst after it has been reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere. The amount of adsorbed CO can provide insights into the number of active metal sites available for reactions.

2. The CO chemisorption technique provides a semiquantitative measure of metal dispersion. However, it can be influenced by factors such as the stoichiometry of the metal-carbon bond, the particle size of the metal, and the presence of other compounds that can lead to spillover of hydrogen. Despite these limitations, CO chemisorption remains a useful tool for comparing the dispersion of metals across different catalyst systems.

3. In the presence of sulfur compounds, the addition of fluorine to the alumina support can enhance the activity of Pt-Pd catalysts. The inhibitory effect of sulfur on the catalyst's performance depends on the conversion level of the sulfur compound. At lower conversion levels, the inhibition is reversible, whereas at higher conversion levels, the poisoning becomes irreversible.

4. EXAFS analysis revealed that when the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst was exposed to 1000 ppm dibenzothiophene (DBT) at high conversion levels, PtS bonds were formed, disrupting the PtPd alloy. In contrast, when fluorine was present on the catalyst, the PtPd alloy remained intact, and no PtS bonds were observed.

1.CO化学吸附是一种用于确定催化剂上活性金属位点和金属分散度的技术。它涉及在300°C下以50ml/min的氢气流对催化剂进行还原1小时后，在四分之一英寸的石英反应器中测量吸附到催化剂表面的二氧化碳量。吸附的CO量可以提供关于可用于反应的金属位点数量的信息。

2.CO化学吸附技术提供了金属分散度的半定量测量方法。然而，它可能受到金属-碳键的摩尔比、金属颗粒大小和其他可能导致氢溢出的化合物的影响。尽管存在这些局限性，CO化学吸附仍然是一种有用的工具，可用于不同催化剂系统之间的金属分散度比较。

3.在硫化合物的存在下，向氧化铝载体中添加氟可以增强Pt-Pd催化剂的活性。硫对催化剂性能的抑制效果取决于硫化合物的转化水平。在较低转化水平时，抑制是可逆的，而在较高转化水平时，中毒变为不可逆的。

4.EXAFS分析显示，当未促进的Pt-Pd催化剂暴露在1000 ppm二苯并噻吩(DBT)且转化水平较高时，形成了PtS键，破坏了PtPd合金。相反，当氟存在于催化剂中时，PtPd合金保持完整，并未观察到形成PtS键。
