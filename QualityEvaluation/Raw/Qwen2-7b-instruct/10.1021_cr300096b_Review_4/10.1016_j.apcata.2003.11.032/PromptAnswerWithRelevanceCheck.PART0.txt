<p>The observed TL conversion followed the same trend as metal dispersion. That is, the unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts showed very high activity while the F-promoted catalysts exhibited much lower activity.</p>
<p>A more interesting trend was observed for the trans/cis ratio in the decalin product as a function of conversion on the three catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2 , the trans/cis ratio depended on the catalyst and was practically constant up to about 70% TL conversion.</p>
<p>The product compositions after 4 h on stream for the two different runs are summarized in Table 4 , together with the feed composition. The hydrogenated products contain the hydrophenanthrenes with different degrees of hydrogenation (di-, tetra-, octa-, and tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene).</p>
<p>At the same space velocity (100 h<sup>-1</sup>), the catalyst prepared by aqueous solution, with a higher metal dispersion, exhibited higher hydrogenation activity than the one prepared by ethylene glycol.</p>
<p>It is clear that the F-containing catalyst kept a higher conversion in the presence of DBT, while the monometallic Pt catalyst was most affected. On the other hand, the monometallic Pt catalyst resulted with the highest activity after removal of DBT from the feed.</p>
<p>These results demonstrate the importance of considering the nature of the sulfur compound under the treatment conditions, since the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may be very different from that of the H<sub>2</sub>S formed from its hydrogenation.</p>
<p>Taking data from Table 3 , Table 4 and from Fig. 4 , we have plotted the conversions of NP and TL as a function of PHE conversion. It is remarkable that disparate data like these, taken from different catalysts, with or without S, the conversions of NP and TL are closely related to the conversion of PHE and all lie on the same curve.</p>
<p>For the most part, the total coordination numbers were conserved, which indicates that the formation of PtS bonds arises at the expense of the PtPt and PtPd bonds.</p>

[1] "Both CO chemisorption and EXAFS data indicate that in this series of catalysts, the addition of F to the alumina support is detrimental to the metal dispersion."
[2] "Noticeably, the concentration of residual Cl on the surface, from the metal precursors, was reduced when F was added."
[3] "The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown)."
[4] "The only difference to this behavior was exhibited by the unpromoted Pd catalyst, which despite a higher dispersion, had a lower activity than the promoted Pd/F-Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "Another interesting result is that the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst has a trans/cis selectivity almost identical to that of pure Pd, which would be an indirect confirmation of previous reports that propose a Pd enrichment on the surface of the alloyed Pt-Pd particles."
[6] "On the less active catalyst, at a PHE conversion of 60, there is very low concentration of the totally hydrogenated tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene, as well as of the totally hydrogenated decalin."
[7] "By contrast, on the more active catalyst, the concentration of the more deeply hydrogenated compounds (1-ring) increased."
[8] "Therefore, it appears that the inhibition by sulfur under these conditions is a reversible blocking of sites."
[9] "These results demonstrate the importance of considering the nature of the sulfur compound under the treatment conditions, since the toxicity of the original sulfur compound may be very different from that of the H2S formed from its hydrogenation."
[10] "In line with this conclusion, the presence of PHE greatly affects the adsorption of NP, and particularly that of TL."
[11] "In all cases, becomes significant only after the elimination of 3040% of PHE, while conversion of TL can only start after the PHE conversion is almost complete."

CO chemisorption and EXAFS techniques both provide valuable insights into metal dispersion on catalysts, but CO chemisorption tends to underestimate dispersion due to metal clustering and support effects. Fluorine (F) addition to alumina supports generally reduces metal dispersion, as seen in the decreased CO uptakes. The concentration of residual Cl also decreases with F addition. The observed trends in metal dispersion are consistent with TEM cluster size data. The unpromoted Pd catalyst, despite having higher dispersion, exhibits lower activity than its fluorine-promoted counterpart. The bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst shows a trans/cis selectivity similar to pure Pd, suggesting Pd enrichment on the surface of the alloy. The less active catalyst yields low concentrations of fully hydrogenated products like tetra-deca-hydro-phenanthrene and decalin, while the more active catalyst increases the concentration of more deeply hydrogenated compounds, such as those with one ring of hydrogenation. The inhibition by sulfur is reversible under certain conditions, and the toxicity of sulfur compounds can differ significantly when hydrogenated to form H2S. The presence of phenanthrene (PHE) significantly influences the adsorption of naphthalene (NP) and tetralin (TL), affecting their hydrogenation rates. The hydrogenation of TL only starts after nearly all PHE has been removed from the feed.

CO化学吸附和EXAFS技术都为催化剂上的金属分散提供了有价值的见解，但CO化学吸附往往低估了分散度，因为存在金属聚集体和支撑效应。向氧化铝支持物中添加氟（F）通常会降低金属分散度，如CO吸收量的减少所示。残留Cl浓度也随F添加而降低。观察到的金属分散趋势与TEM簇大小数据一致。尽管具有更高分散度的Pd催化剂的活性较低，其氟促进的对应物却显示出更高的活性。二元合金Pt-Pd催化剂的顺/反选择性类似于纯Pd，表明Pd在合金表面的富集。活性较低的催化剂产生少量完全氢化产物，如四十二烷氢化物和十氢化萘，而活性较高的催化剂增加了更多深度氢化的化合物，如仅含一个环氢化的化合物。硫抑制是可逆的，在特定条件下，硫化合物的毒性可能大不相同，因为它们被氢化形成H2S。苯并菲（PHE）显著影响萘（NP）和四氢化萘（TL）的吸附，影响它们的氢化速率。只有在从饲料中去除几乎全部PHE后，才开始氢化TL。

<p>Both CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd. And, as it has been long recognized, the stoichiometry may vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size.</p>
<p>Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd.</p>
<p>The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the concentration of residual Cl on the surface, from the metal precursors, was reduced when F was added.</p>
<p>The fitting parameters evidence the formation of PtPd bonds on the two bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>Overall, the observed TL conversion followed the same trend as metal dispersion. That is, the unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts showed very high activity while the F-promoted catalysts exhibited much lower activity.</p>
<p>First, for the sulfur-free feeds ( Fig. 8a ), it can be seen that a feed of 30 wt.% TL causes much lower coke formation than that obtained on the same catalyst (Pt-Pd/Al2O3) with the model feed. This difference indicates that the 2- and 3- ring aromatics produce more coke than TL.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if one observes the activity drop in Fig. 4 for PHE and NP as a function of time, one may be inclined to conclude that the deactivation for NP production is more pronounced than that for PHE production.</p>
<p>For the most part, the total coordination numbers were conserved, which indicates that the formation of PtS bonds arises at the expense of the PtPt and PtPd bonds.</p>

1. CO chemisorption can provide information on the exposed metal fraction, but the stoichiometry variations from Pt to Pd make it difficult to directly quantify dispersion.
2. The coordination numbers of the catalysts correlate with their dispersion, showing a decreasing order of Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.
3. The concentration of residual Cl decreases when fluorine is added to the catalyst.
4. The formation of PtPd bonds is evidenced through curve fitting.
5. The conversion trends follow the metal dispersion order, with unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts exhibiting high activity.
6. The presence of 3-ring aromatics leads to higher coke formation compared to 30 wt.% TL in the sulfur-free feed.
7. The drop in NP production activity may be more pronounced than PHE, but the data points lying on the same line in Fig. 6 suggests that site inhibition by PHE is also a factor.
8. The total coordination numbers remain constant, indicating that PtS bonds form at the expense of PtPt and PtPd bonds.

[1] "The CO uptake measurements were performed in a 1/4 in. quartz reactor containing 0.100 g catalyst after reduction in a 50 ml/min flow of H2 at 300 C for 1 h."
[2] "The addition of F to the alumina support is detrimental to the metal dispersion."
[3] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."
[4] "EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions."

1. CO chemisorption is a technique used to determine the active metal sites and metal dispersion on a catalyst. It involves measuring the amount of carbon monoxide adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst after it has been reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere. The amount of adsorbed CO can provide insights into the number of active metal sites available for reactions.

2. The CO chemisorption technique provides a semiquantitative measure of metal dispersion. However, it can be influenced by factors such as the stoichiometry of the metal-carbon bond, the particle size of the metal, and the presence of other compounds that can lead to spillover of hydrogen. Despite these limitations, CO chemisorption remains a useful tool for comparing the dispersion of metals across different catalyst systems.

3. In the presence of sulfur compounds, the addition of fluorine to the alumina support can enhance the activity of Pt-Pd catalysts. The inhibitory effect of sulfur on the catalyst's performance depends on the conversion level of the sulfur compound. At lower conversion levels, the inhibition is reversible, whereas at higher conversion levels, the poisoning becomes irreversible.

4. EXAFS analysis revealed that when the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst was exposed to 1000 ppm dibenzothiophene (DBT) at high conversion levels, PtS bonds were formed, disrupting the PtPd alloy. In contrast, when fluorine was present on the catalyst, the PtPd alloy remained intact, and no PtS bonds were observed.

1.CO化学吸附是一种用于确定催化剂上活性金属位点和金属分散度的技术。它涉及在300°C下以50ml/min的氢气流对催化剂进行还原1小时后，在四分之一英寸的石英反应器中测量吸附到催化剂表面的二氧化碳量。吸附的CO量可以提供关于可用于反应的金属位点数量的信息。

2.CO化学吸附技术提供了金属分散度的半定量测量方法。然而，它可能受到金属-碳键的摩尔比、金属颗粒大小和其他可能导致氢溢出的化合物的影响。尽管存在这些局限性，CO化学吸附仍然是一种有用的工具，可用于不同催化剂系统之间的金属分散度比较。

3.在硫化合物的存在下，向氧化铝载体中添加氟可以增强Pt-Pd催化剂的活性。硫对催化剂性能的抑制效果取决于硫化合物的转化水平。在较低转化水平时，抑制是可逆的，而在较高转化水平时，中毒变为不可逆的。

4.EXAFS分析显示，当未促进的Pt-Pd催化剂暴露在1000 ppm二苯并噻吩(DBT)且转化水平较高时，形成了PtS键，破坏了PtPd合金。相反，当氟存在于催化剂中时，PtPd合金保持完整，并未观察到形成PtS键。

[1] "The CO uptakes of all the catalysts investigated are shown in Table 1 . Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd."
[2] "This does not seem to be the typical trend. A previous FTIR study [37] has reported improved Pt dispersions on fluorinated alumina compared to those that on unfluorinated supports."
[3] "To avoid the complications that may arise with hydrogen chemisorption (i.e. spillover) we have employed CO chemisorption to estimate exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts."
[4] "The observed trend is perfectly consistent with the EXAFS data shown below and with the cluster sizes observed by TEM (not shown)."
[5] "These changes seem to adversely affect the dispersion of metals during the calcinations conducted in this work."
[6] "The impregnation method has also an effect on metal dispersion. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 sample prepared by aqueous solution resulted in higher exposed metal fraction than that of F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3(E), prepared using ethylene glycol."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
CO chemisorption is used to estimate the exposed metal fraction (dispersion) of the different catalysts because hydrogen chemisorption can lead to complications such as spillover, which may distort the true metal dispersion. The CO uptake values can only be used as a semiquantitative measure of differences within one metal system. The dispersion of metals is affected by the impregnation method used to prepare the catalysts. The F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalyst prepared using aqueous solution had a higher exposed metal fraction compared to the one prepared using ethylene glycol. The observed trends in metal dispersion are consistent with EXAFS data and TEM cluster sizes.

CO吸附法用于估计不同催化剂中暴露金属的比例（分散度），因为氢吸附可能会导致复杂性，如溢出，这可能会影响真实的金属分散度。CO吸收值只能作为在一种金属系统内差异的半定量测量。金属分散度受到制备催化剂的方法的影响。使用水溶液制备的F-Pt-Pd/Al2O3催化剂的暴露金属比例高于使用乙二醇制备的催化剂。观察到的金属分散度趋势与EXAFS数据和TEM簇大小一致。
