<p>Both CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd. And, as it has been long recognized, the stoichiometry may vary, even for the same metal, with varying particle size.</p>
<p>Although CO uptakes increase with the exposed metal fraction, a direct quantification of dispersion is not possible from these values alone since the CO/metal stoichiometry varies from Pt to Pd.</p>
<p>The observed trend in coordination numbers for the three catalysts is in good correspondence with the CO uptakes. That is, the metal dispersion follows the order Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.</p>
<p>Noticeably, the concentration of residual Cl on the surface, from the metal precursors, was reduced when F was added.</p>
<p>The fitting parameters evidence the formation of PtPd bonds on the two bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>Overall, the observed TL conversion followed the same trend as metal dispersion. That is, the unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts showed very high activity while the F-promoted catalysts exhibited much lower activity.</p>
<p>First, for the sulfur-free feeds ( Fig. 8a ), it can be seen that a feed of 30 wt.% TL causes much lower coke formation than that obtained on the same catalyst (Pt-Pd/Al2O3) with the model feed. This difference indicates that the 2- and 3- ring aromatics produce more coke than TL.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if one observes the activity drop in Fig. 4 for PHE and NP as a function of time, one may be inclined to conclude that the deactivation for NP production is more pronounced than that for PHE production.</p>
<p>For the most part, the total coordination numbers were conserved, which indicates that the formation of PtS bonds arises at the expense of the PtPt and PtPd bonds.</p>

1. CO chemisorption can provide information on the exposed metal fraction, but the stoichiometry variations from Pt to Pd make it difficult to directly quantify dispersion.
2. The coordination numbers of the catalysts correlate with their dispersion, showing a decreasing order of Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3.
3. The concentration of residual Cl decreases when fluorine is added to the catalyst.
4. The formation of PtPd bonds is evidenced through curve fitting.
5. The conversion trends follow the metal dispersion order, with unpromoted Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts exhibiting high activity.
6. The presence of 3-ring aromatics leads to higher coke formation compared to 30 wt.% TL in the sulfur-free feed.
7. The drop in NP production activity may be more pronounced than PHE, but the data points lying on the same line in Fig. 6 suggests that site inhibition by PHE is also a factor.
8. The total coordination numbers remain constant, indicating that PtS bonds form at the expense of PtPt and PtPd bonds.

1. CO吸附可以提供暴露金属比例的信息，但由于Pt和Pd的 stoichiometry变化，直接量化分散性存在困难。
2. 催化剂的配合数与分散度相关，显示出Pt/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/Al2O3 > Pt-Pd/F-Al2O3的递减顺序。
3. 添加氟时，表面残留Cl浓度降低。
4. 通过曲线拟合证明了PtPd键的形成。
5. 观察到的TL转化率遵循金属分散度的顺序，未促进的Pt和Pt-Pd催化剂表现出高活性。
6. 含有3环芳香族化合物导致更高焦炭形成，相比30 wt.% TL在无硫清液中的焦炭形成量更低。
7. 观察到NP生产活动可能比PHE更显著下降，但在第6幅图中数据点位于同一直线上表明PHE的位点抑制也是一个因素。
8. 总配合数保持不变，说明PtS键形成是PtPt和PtPd键的代价。
